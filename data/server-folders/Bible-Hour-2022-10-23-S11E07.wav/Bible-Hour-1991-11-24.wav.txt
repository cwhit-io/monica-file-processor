[time=0] You know, it's interesting how the church 2000 years ago can struggle with the same things
[time=6] that it can struggle with today.
[time=8] We're studying 1 Timothy and we're beginning chapter 2.
[time=12] The church at Ephesus, the church to which this book was written, was struggling in that it was being confronted by false doctrine, a false gospel.
[time=20] Its pastor was faulting and considering giving up in the ministry, and the church itself was lacking direction.
[time=27] And Paul writes this letter to help the church.
[time=29] What do you think Paul says is the single most important thing that that church needs
[time=35] to do to survive under the conditions it was facing?
[time=39] Stay tuned this morning.
[time=40] We're going to look at that single most important direction that Paul gives the church at Ephesus.
[time=46] Maybe it'll help the church of America today as well.
[time=60] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=66] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=68] Thank you for joining us.
[time=70] One of the central themes throughout the book of Timothy is instruction regarding the purpose and administration of the church of Jesus Christ.
[time=77] Paul tells us the single most important thing the church should do is to pray for unbelievers.
[time=82] Paul's first and foremost instruction to his young pastor friend Timothy is, "Timothy,
[time=88] get your church praying for the salvation of souls." Please have your Bibles open to 1 Timothy chapter 2.
[time=97] We will be studying verses 1 through 8.
[time=101] Our special music today will be provided by Keith Brodigum.
[time=105] He will be singing one of the old favorites entitled, "The Love of God."
[time=111] As we prepare for our time of worship, let's listen to the sanctuary choir and Marilyn Wong as they remind us during this thanksgiving season that our God has been faithful to us.
[time=146] Through every pain, every tear, there's a God who's been faithful to me.
[time=163] When my strength was all gone, when my heart had no soul,
[time=174] still in love he proved faithful to me.
[time=184] Every time I come back to him, he is waiting with open eyes.
[time=201] Can I see once again?
[time=209] He's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=224] Looking back in his love and mercy, I see.
[time=235] Though in my heart I have questioned even where to be.
[time=246] And when my heart looked away, the many times
[time=275] I could not pray, still by God he was faithful to me.
[time=289] The days I spent so selfishly reaching out for what pleased me,
[time=301] even then God was faithful to me.
[time=312] Every word he's promised is true.
[time=323] What I thought was impossible, I see my God do.
[time=336] He's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=351] And when your friend in his love and mercy, I see.
[time=362] Though in my heart I have questioned even where to be.
[time=373] And when your friend in his love and mercy, I see, still by God he was faithful to me.
[time=398] And when your friend in his love and mercy, I see.
[time=430] And when your friend in his love and mercy, I see, still by God he was faithful to me.
[time=450] God is faithful, I mention in the first service that as we listen to the choir and we see them
[time=459] and hear them sing those words that they're not without their problems and their circumstances that they go through and that we are aware of.
[time=467] And yet we are confident that God is there and will take us through those difficult times and perhaps some of you are going through some difficult times right now.
[time=476] Remember, He is faithful.
[time=479] Let's stand together please and we're going to do the brief service on 558, a song of
[time=485] Thanksgiving, 558 will begin with responsive reading and then sing the following songs.
[time=494] God saw all that He had made and it was very good.
[time=513] You crown the year with your bounty and your carts overflow with abundance.
[time=518] The grasslands of the desert overflow, the hills are clothed with gladness.
[time=534] He makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for man to cultivate, bringing forth food from the earth.
[time=541] How many are your works, O Lord?
[time=544] In wisdom you made them all, the earth is full of your creatures.
[time=564] I, with the song of Thanksgiving, will sacrifice to you what I have found and I will make good.
[time=572] Salvation comes from the Lord.
[time=580] God, we thank all we have found, bringing the strong harvest home, all the same thing,
[time=598] and the winter strongs in me, the raker not so high, O Lord, what should be so far?
[time=614] God's own damn above, raker some apart as stone.
[time=629] Lord, our beauty, our fear, O Lord, our glory of the skies, O Lord, our love, we draw our
[time=648] earth, over and around the skies, Lord of all to thee we raise, this are in a grateful
[time=664] place, Lord of all to thee we raise, this are in a wonderful place.
[time=691] Lord, our love to thee we raise, this are in a grateful place, Lord of all to thee we
[time=721] raise, this are in a wonderful place, Lord of all to thee we raise, this is in a wonderful
[time=776] place, this is in a wonderful place, this is in a wonderful place, this is in a wonderful
[time=814] [MUSIC]
[time=819] - Well, thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=827] Russell, we just finished a brief service of Thanksgiving in our congregational singing on the Bible Hour, and I really appreciate those songs.
[time=836] We're into the Thanksgiving season, so thankful for my family and the opportunity that we can have to be together during this time.
[time=843] - I couldn't agree with you more.
[time=844] I think one of the greatest mistakes we make is that of ingratitude, and it's hard to be thankful for so many things that God has given us, but I know He wants us to continually affirm our thanks to Him for all that He's done, and there is so much to be thankful for.
[time=857] - I know that I have family that get together in California, and you're gonna be the same way, but we have friends from Washington that are now ministering in Illinois, and they're gonna be coming over, and it's just neat to have had acquaintances over the years in various parts of the country, and then come back together when we don't often do that, so we're looking forward to that time.
[time=877] We had a Thanksgiving service here, and the church was all decorated, and we had a great fragrance of all of the cooking that the ladies did for that time, and we appreciated that.
[time=890] Russ, we've been talking about a booklet that I want to remind the people of, again, it's called Christ in Christmas Family Advent Celebration, and this is our last day that we're going to be offering the booklet, and it is a series of activities going into the last four weeks of Christmas, so if you'd like to receive this book, you need to write this week so we can get it to you right away so you can be involved in the book with your family.
[time=915] You can receive this book by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=925] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=934] You know, Russ, it's traditional in our family, even when we were in California.
[time=938] Remember, the weather being something like 85 degrees, but we'd go outside of New Hall out into the mountains and cut down a living, a live Christmas tree, and we do that the day or so after Thanksgiving every year, and that's kind of one of the family involvements that we have.
[time=956] - I don't know if you have any unique things that you do.
[time=957] - We do very much the same thing.
[time=959] Where as soon as Thanksgiving's over, we get that tree going, and sometimes I don't have the best luck getting my tree to stand up straight, so we've had some tense years with Dad being a little frustrated and all, and then we finally get the train around the bottom of the tree, and well, I guess some of our best memories come from the Christmas season.
[time=976] The book that we're offering, I've sent a copy to two friends of mine in California who are very interested even in the gospel have families, and I'm hoping the Lord will use that even as a tool in their heart and lives to continue to open their minds to Christ and to all the wonder of Christmas as God sent His Son.
[time=994] - Well, it certainly focuses on the right idea of the ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ and His reason for coming, so I hope people will write for it.
[time=1003] We have another date looking forward.
[time=1004] If you do not have a Christmas Eve service on December 24th, we have a service here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1011] It's a time of singing and communion, Russell Moore our pastor teacher will be leading that, and it's a great evening of fellowship.
[time=1019] That's at 7 p.m. on Christmas Eve, December 24th, right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1025] Russell, this will be your first time.
[time=1026] We were quite surprised when we started this just a few years ago and the number of people that came and fellowshiped together, and again, that was a candlelight environment where we really got down and worshiped the Lord that night and worshiped the Savior.
[time=1042] It was a wonderful time, and I know, no doubt you're looking forward to it, you've led us in some wonderful communion services.
[time=1049] - Well, the great thing is that we can do that with other churches on a night like that, and it's great to see the love of Christ go across church boundaries and special seasons we can gather together and just focus on worship and anticipate the wonder of the next day.
[time=1063] - Let me tell you again that we're having a Christmas Eve service, December 24th at 7 p.m.
[time=1068] right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1070] You don't have a service, I hope that you can come and join us, it's just an hour long, and it's a great time of worship together that evening.
[time=1078] We go back to the regular portion of our service now as Keith Brodygum minister is to us in music, and we have the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=1086] Stay with us, won't you?
[time=1087] (upbeat music)
[time=1100] [MUSIC - 225 seconds]
[time=1333] (audience applauds)
[time=1340] - Amen, thank you Keith for that powerful song,
[time=1349] for your life, for what you're doing at Huntington College with the students, as God blesses your music ministry.
[time=1355] If you take your Bibles this morning, let's go back to First Timothy, having concluded our series on giving.
[time=1363] We get to jump back into the drama of the life of Timothy as he has been instructed to remain on at Ephesus, to instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines.
[time=1376] We come to chapter two, we come to a paragraph in chapter two, verses one through eight, that is all about evangelistic prayer, all about praying for the lost, to see men and women come to know Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.
[time=1390] Follow along with you as I read these eight verses so we can set them in our minds as we begin to study them.
[time=1398] First of all, then I urge that in treaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all who are in authority in order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=1414] This is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1423] For there is one God and one mediator also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony borne at the proper time.
[time=1434] And for this, I was appointed a preacher and an apostle as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
[time=1442] Therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension.
[time=1449] Eight verses devoted to praying for the lost.
[time=1455] And I guess at first glance in my own life, and maybe in yours when you've read these verses, you came away with the impression that it was more about kings and those who are in authority, almost a Romans 13 passage about how to conduct ourselves under the civil authorities.
[time=1470] But in reality, the idea here is that we are to be praying for all men.
[time=1475] You see it at the end of verse one.
[time=1477] Praying for all men and the kings and those who are in authority are only a subset of those all men.
[time=1484] We pray for the kings and those in authority in order that their administration, as verse two shows you, might allow us to lead tranquil and quiet lives in godliness and dignity.
[time=1494] And that in the theme of this passage that we might live evangelistically, that their administration would allow us to live in such a way as to propagate the gospel.
[time=1504] So we do pray for them, but it's not just about them, it's primarily about all men.
[time=1510] What are we praying for all of these men?
[time=1512] We are praying in accordance with the will of God as explained in verse four.
[time=1516] God desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1522] So these verses about evangelistic prayer, who we praying for?
[time=1526] All men everywhere.
[time=1528] And what are we praying for these men?
[time=1530] That they should come to know Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.
[time=1535] There are basically three themes which leapfrog throughout the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=1543] I want to remind you of those themes because they need to be re-implanted in our mind so that we'll understand the flow of the book and the significance of these eight verses here on prayer.
[time=1553] You remember that the church at Ephesus, that's where Timothy is, was confronted with some serious obstacles.
[time=1559] They were caught in a pagan culture which was dominated by the temple Diana or the temple Artemis, full of prostitution, both male and female and all the pagan cults and fertility rights that were associated with it.
[time=1572] And this was such a spectacular temple that it really dominated all of the culture of the city of Ephesus.
[time=1578] And so it was an ungodly worldly city in which to live.
[time=1583] Beyond that though, they were being corrupted by false doctrine.
[time=1587] There were teachers in their own church and teachers from outside the church which were attacking the purity of the gospel of Jesus Christ and were making it into a works religion instead of true faith.
[time=1598] True salvation by grace through faith.
[time=1601] In addition to that, Timothy himself, the one whom Paul had sent to straighten out some of these problems was faltering.
[time=1609] He was in reverse.
[time=1610] He was retreating.
[time=1611] He was questioning his own call to the ministry, his own capacity for the ministry and his own commitment to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1619] And we believe he was being allured into the materialism of this pagan culture.
[time=1623] Beyond that, and as you might expect then, the church was without direction.
[time=1629] They needed direction.
[time=1630] They had lost their sense of purpose and they had some things that were not in order.
[time=1635] And so in chapter three, verse 15, Paul says, I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself and the household of God which is the church of the living God, the pillar in support of the truth.
[time=1646] The church had lost its priorities and its direction and he writes to instruct them on many different issues about the church.
[time=1653] Now these themes leapfrog as I've said through the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=1660] He began in the first chapter as we've seen talking about these false prophets and their false gospel.
[time=1666] He addresses that for the first time.
[time=1668] He'll address it again in chapter four and again in chapter six.
[time=1672] He then moved in chapter one, to verses 18 to 20 where he gave Timothy a charge to fight the good fight, to fight the noble fight.
[time=1679] That's his first address personally to Timothy.
[time=1681] He'll do that again in chapter four and again in chapter six.
[time=1686] But what we come to in chapter two for the very first time is the beginning of Paul's instruction to the people of Ephesus in this church.
[time=1694] This isn't about the false prophets and their doctrine.
[time=1696] This isn't specifically to Timothy.
[time=1698] This is to the people.
[time=1699] This is to the body of Christ at Ephesus.
[time=1703] And he begins in a most astounding way.
[time=1706] Look at verse one again of chapter two.
[time=1709] He says, first of all then, first of all then.
[time=1712] Now this is not according to the language in the Greek.
[time=1716] This is not an idea of sequence.
[time=1719] I'm gonna say a lot of things and this is number one and then here's number two and then here's number three.
[time=1723] Instead, what he's saying here is this is the most important thing I'm going to say to you.
[time=1729] This is the most significant parcel of information that I will give to you as a body of believers.
[time=1737] And that's kind of astounding.
[time=1738] When you think about some of the other things he's saying, look at the next paragraph in chapter two.
[time=1743] It begins in verse nine.
[time=1744] He's gonna instruct the women as to how they are to be a part of the worship.
[time=1748] So he's saying what I wanna say to you about evangelistic prayer is more important than what I'm gonna say about the women.
[time=1754] It's more important than in chapter three when I talk about elders and qualifications of elders.
[time=1759] He's gonna say it's more important than deacons in chapter three, verse eight and their qualifications and ministry.
[time=1766] It's even more important over in chapter five than what I'm gonna say to widows and how we should care for the needy in our church.
[time=1774] And really to tell you the truth as I was studying it, this week that took me by surprise.
[time=1778] What he's saying is that what I'm now gonna tell you in so far as your commitment, my urging you to pray evangelistically, this is it.
[time=1788] This is the most important part of what I'm gonna say.
[time=1792] More important than the women, more important than the men as elders and deacons and the widows.
[time=1796] I thought, how can this be?
[time=1798] How can this be?
[time=1799] Well, I believe the answer comes with an understanding.
[time=1807] That and a reminding of why the church is on the planet in the first place.
[time=1814] Why are we here?
[time=1816] Are we here to know the truth?
[time=1819] Are we here to study the word of God and know the truth?
[time=1822] Yes, is that our ultimate end here on earth?
[time=1825] No.
[time=1826] If that were our ultimate end, God would take us to heaven where we have perfect knowledge of a perfect God and learning would be no more.
[time=1832] We'd know everything we were supposed to know.
[time=1835] Are we here to have fellowship exclusively?
[time=1837] I mean, is that our ultimate end?
[time=1839] Are we here as the New Testament church or the church of the New Testament to have fellowship and coindonea as sweet as that is?
[time=1846] Is that our ultimate end?
[time=1847] No.
[time=1849] If that were the case, he'd again take us to heaven where all of our personal sin would be removed, our corporate sin would be removed and we will be in constant and total uninterrupted, unadulterated fellowship with the living God forever.
[time=1859] It's not for fellowship.
[time=1860] Is it to praise God?
[time=1863] Is that why we're here?
[time=1864] Are we here to praise God?
[time=1866] Well, yes, but is that our ultimate end?
[time=1869] Certainly not or there.
[time=1870] We would be taken to heaven again where we will do that in a pure and pristine way, a way we'll never know here.
[time=1877] The fact is that we are reminded in this passage that our ultimate mission here on earth is to fulfill the great commission to win people to the lost.
[time=1885] And as he stops and says you're having trouble with your culture, you're having trouble with your doctrine, you're having trouble with your leader, listen, don't take and get on the defensive.
[time=1894] Don't call a church meeting.
[time=1895] Don't call in some consultant.
[time=1897] Don't do some new program.
[time=1899] Get down on your knees and start praying for the lost.
[time=1902] And in that, remind yourself of the very reason for which you're on the planet, which is to call people into the kingdom of God.
[time=1909] It's like a football team that forgets its ultimate objective and the quarterback thinks I'm on the team to throw good passes and the receiver thinks I'm on the team to catch good passes and the punter says I'm on the team to kick good punts.
[time=1921] And the lineman says I'm on the team to block good and all that's wrong.
[time=1925] That's not why they're on the team.
[time=1928] They're on the team to win.
[time=1929] They're on the team to win and their proper role and their proper function on the team is only of any value as it is coming together in a concerted effort to accomplish the one simple objective they have on the field that day, which is to win.
[time=1943] So it is true in the church.
[time=1945] The church does not have a pastor so the pastor can pastor.
[time=1949] The church does not have deacons so the deacons can deak, if you will.
[time=1954] The church does not have elders so the elders can elder.
[time=1957] Though those are all subordinate functions to the purpose and the reality of why God has left the church on the planet, which is to win souls for Christ and to fulfill the great commission.
[time=1967] And I'll say that's true of the family.
[time=1969] Exact same thing is true of the family.
[time=1971] The church has nothing more than a bunch of families.
[time=1973] Basically, we're blessed by some single people in our midst and we thank God for them.
[time=1979] But basically we're a collection of families and what's the purpose of a family?
[time=1985] Same thing, when people for the lost.
[time=1987] Every chance I get the council young people as they're preparing for marriage and premarital counseling and we're about ready to do their wedding.
[time=1993] I try to remind them over and over and over again.
[time=1995] You're not getting married for each other.
[time=1997] You're not getting married so you can have kids.
[time=1999] You're not getting married so you can buy a house and two cars, put them in your garage, buy a mobile home and die someday.
[time=2004] You are getting married because in your union, you are a living representation of Christ's love for the church and in that you have a partnership for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2013] That's why we get married because that wonderful, miraculous love of Jesus Christ for the church is best exemplified in our marriage relationship and so we have in our union a living partnership for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2029] When that is clearly understood, the husband's role takes shape.
[time=2032] It has meaning, it has purpose.
[time=2034] The wife's role, the kid's role and all the things that the Bible says about that family begin to get into focus and take on their truest and ultimate meaning as they understand that they are here to win, if you will, to bring people to Christ.
[time=2047] So on a personal level, on a family level and on a church level, he and these verses reminds us of our mission.
[time=2057] He says, "Take an offensive position.
[time=2061] "The world is assaulting you.
[time=2062] "Take an offensive position, how?
[time=2065] "On your knees.
[time=2067] "Get down on your knees, if you will, and pray." There is no greater declaration of dependence than prayer.
[time=2073] Prayer says, "I can't do it." Prayer says, "I'm not enough." Prayer says, "There needs to be a bigger "and a stronger source to do this, "or it'll just never get done, "and that is true of evangelism, "if it's true of anything." So he says, " Penetrate the world "with the truth of Jesus Christ." You say, "How?" He says, "With your hands folded on your knees, "begging that the God of creation will say the souls "of whom, or to whom, you minister the gospel." And I'm also thrilled that he calls us to prayer here because typically people don't pray for things that aren't bound up in their heart.
[time=2104] We pray for things that are heavy on our hearts.
[time=2107] And what he's saying is, "I want the mission of the church "and the great commission and your reason for existence "to win people to Christ, to be so deeply embedded "on your heart that it just flows out of your life in prayer." That's what he's calling us to.
[time=2119] That's what he was calling this church to.
[time=2123] After that is clearly understood.
[time=2124] Then we can talk about women, and then we can talk about elders, and then we can talk about deacons, and then we can talk about widows, and then we can talk about all the other things of the church, but first we have to be reminded of why we exist.
[time=2135] So this is a powerful message about the mission of the church to be in the world, not of the world, to attack rather than to retreat, to have a clear understanding of her mission and to pursue that mission through the power of prayer, through holy and chaste and respectable behavior in concert with the will of God.
[time=2156] So I call that the priority, the priority of praying for the lost.
[time=2163] Number two, let's look at the pattern.
[time=2167] The pattern of praying for the lost, if that's so, if we're supposed to be involved in praying for the lost, how, how do we do that?
[time=2174] What does that look like?
[time=2176] Then that too is found in verse one.
[time=2178] First of all, then I urge that in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men.
[time=2186] Those are four synonyms, basically.
[time=2188] Those are all the same kinds of words, but there is a variation of meaning in each, and I don't want to belittle what the Apostle Paul did in selecting these four words and their various nuance.
[time=2200] In treaties, or as the NIV calls it, requests, comes from the idea, or a Greek root, to chance upon, to have an audience with a king, to, to, by chance, get, to be so favored that I end up in the audience of the king whereby I can make a request.
[time=2217] And that's why it's spoken of as an entreaty or a request, meaning a very specific petition.
[time=2223] The, the picture being, if you're fortunate enough to get into the presence of the king and, and he may grant you a request, you don't whip out your list of 37 requests and say, and I just give you a minute, I'll work my way through these and, and hopefully we can get all these things.
[time=2237] That the picture is of somebody, you know, with, with a person who's been wrongfully accused and tried and is waiting death and that pleading mother is saying, I've got one request, I finally made it.
[time=2247] I'm in the presence of the king.
[time=2248] Would you give me this one thing?
[time=2250] It's a very specific request.
[time=2253] It may be the kind of request that Stephen issued
[time=2259] to his God when he was being stoned by the Jews in Acts chapter seven.
[time=2264] It was a very specific thing he requested of his God.
[time=2267] The last words he basically ever said, Lord, do not hold this sin against them.
[time=2271] What he was praying evangelistically right there, he was saying, God, these men have murdered me for telling them the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2278] Now please, don't hold this against them.
[time=2280] Forgive them how, through salvation, through Christ.
[time=2283] His very last words were a very specific request or entreaty on behalf of those who were killing him as he prayed evangelistically that they should live and not die eternally for their behavior.
[time=2295] The same word is used over in 1 Timothy chapter five, verse five, speaking of the widow.
[time=2302] Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.
[time=2312] Here's a picture of a widow that is very faithfully bringing these specific requests into the throne room of God.
[time=2321] So in the context of evangelistic prayer, the idea here is you're praying and my praying for individuals, people that we know loved ones who aren't saved or people that we work with and people that are near to our heart and we know the circumstances of their life and we come into the throne room of God and we make very specific petition that God would say these people by name.
[time=2342] We were rejoicing this week in EE
[time=2348] as we noticed on the Wednesday night prayer sheet that Linda Archer's father-in-law came to Christ and many of you have been praying for him specifically for great numbers of months and years.
[time=2359] That's the idea.
[time=2360] Bringing an individual before God, his circumstances, his life.
[time=2365] Well then it goes on.
[time=2367] I urge that in treaties and the next word, prayers.
[time=2369] This is a general word.
[time=2372] This is the most general word in the New Testament for prayer and it speaks of general prayer requests and so in the context of praying evangelistically it's safe to assume that we are here praying for the people of the world.
[time=2383] People we don't know their name.
[time=2384] We don't know their situation.
[time=2386] The people of Jamaica that our missionaries are ministering to.
[time=2388] We don't know all their names but we pray God use our people there to bring them to Christ.
[time=2394] When we pray for Russia, when we pray for Iran and for Iraq and for countries such as that, we're praying for people groups and ethnic groups.
[time=2402] We can even pray that way for ethnic groups within our city as our city has some different ethnic groups.
[time=2407] These are general prayers where we don't know the actual names of the people themselves but we know they exist as a people group and we pray God open their eyes to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2417] Take away the blinding of Satan.
[time=2419] Let the word of God penetrate.
[time=2421] Send somebody with the gospel.
[time=2423] Send somebody else to live the gospel, not just the message but the whole lifestyle.
[time=2427] God save these people.
[time=2430] That's the kind of praying that Paul did in Romans chapter 10 verse one when he said, "Brother in my heart's desire and my prayer for them is for their salvation." He was praying for the entire nation of Israel as a composite group saying God save them.
[time=2445] Save them.
[time=2448] Allow them to know Jesus Christ.
[time=2450] The next word there is petitions.
[time=2455] Petitions or as the NIV calls it, intercession and that may be the better translation, intercession.
[time=2462] It talks about freedom of access.
[time=2465] This word isn't the chance of an opportunity of a lifetime with a king.
[time=2469] This is the constant regular opportunity that I have to go in and out with the king to draw near into the throne room of God.
[time=2477] And this is the word for passion in your prayer.
[time=2480] This is the intercession that the Spirit of God prays for us as Romans eight says, when we're groaning over our own lives and we don't even know the words to articulate what we're asking for, the Spirit of God feels that and He groans with us and He prays for us in the presence of God.
[time=2497] This is the pathos and the empathy and the passion of praying for the lost because we are caring for them so deeply it comes from within.
[time=2506] It's the same word of Jesus and His intercession for us in Romans eight 34.
[time=2511] Come with me to Exodus chapter 32 and you'll see you.
[time=2515] One of the premier intercessory prayers of all the Bible
[time=2521] is we look at the life of Moses.
[time=2523] This was a dark day for the nation of Israel.
[time=2528] Moses had been delayed.
[time=2531] He had not come down from the mountain and the people had come to Aaron and said, "Let us make a God who will go before us as for this Moses the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt." We don't know where he is or what's become of him.
[time=2545] And so they did that.
[time=2546] They made a golden calf.
[time=2549] And in verse six, Exodus 32, verse six, so the next day they rose early and offered bird offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play.
[time=2561] The word play here in the Hebrew is a sensual, sexual term that was describing an orgy.
[time=2567] These people haven't forgotten the God that brought them and Moses, his representative because he stayed a few, too many days up on the mountain, said, "Let's forget him, let's make our own God." So they made a calf, a fertility representation, a bowl of fertility.
[time=2581] And then they did what they do with those things.
[time=2582] They sat down, they ate, they got drunk, and then they had an orgy, a national orgy right there as they waited for Moses to come down from the mountain.
[time=2591] Verse seven, "Then the Lord spoke to Moses, go down at once, for your people whom you brought up from the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.
[time=2600] They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them.
[time=2604] They have made for themselves a molten calf and have worshiped it and have sacrificed to it and said, "This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt." And the Lord said to Moses, "I have seen this people and behold, they are an obstinate people.
[time=2617] I'm done with them." Look at verse 10, "Now then let me alone that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them.
[time=2626] And I will make of you a great nation." I mean, this is it.
[time=2630] If there were ever any pride in Moses' heart, now is the time to seize it.
[time=2634] What God is saying is, "We'll wipe out all of the seed of Abraham and you'll be the new patriarch.
[time=2639] You'll be the one through whom the blessings of God now come to all the nations.
[time=2643] I'll start again with you." But listen to his response in verse 11, "Then Moses entreated the Lord as God and said, O Lord God, why doth thine anger burn against thy people whom thou hast brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
[time=2659] Why should the Egyptians speak saying with evil intent he brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth?
[time=2668] Turn from thy burning anger and change thy mind about doing them harm." Remember Abraham, Isaac and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou did swear by thyself and did say to them, "I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven as all this land of which I have spoken, I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever." Verse 14, "So the Lord changed his mind.
[time=2691] And the harm which he said he would do to his people, he didn't do it." This is unbelievable.
[time=2698] This is the kind of passion and the kind of commitment to what?
[time=2702] To God.
[time=2703] Moses is here defending God's honor.
[time=2706] Moses is saying, "God, you don't want to destroy these people.
[time=2709] You have raised them up so that your name could be proclaimed throughout all the world and that the nations of the world could come to know you through the nation of Israel.
[time=2718] And if you do what you just said you're going to do, you're going to destroy your evangelistic testimony all over the world." And that's exactly what we're called to in 1 Timothy, to pray for the souls of all men in accordance with the will of God that all of them should come to salvation.
[time=2737] So when you and I pray, we begin with our entreaties, we begin with our specific requests for the people in our lives.
[time=2743] We have names and faces and feelings and circumstances.
[time=2747] And then we broaden our prayers to the general scope of the nations of the world and the people groups of the world.
[time=2753] But we don't go with a disinterest at heart.
[time=2755] We come interceding because it's our privilege to go to the throne room of God where these unsaved people cannot get.
[time=2762] They're not saved, they have no entrance there.
[time=2764] But we have interest and so we go and we pray and we plead that God would save them even according to His own will.
[time=2773] It's a powerful sequence of thought in our prayer.
[time=2778] Psalm 106, 23 says this about Moses' intercession, "Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses chosen one stood in the breach before him
[time=2792] to turn away his wrath from destroying them." Moses stood in the gap.
[time=2798] Moses had a heart for the cause and the kingdom and for those people and stood in the gap and said, "Don't do this, Lord.
[time=2805] Don't do this." Well, the fourth term back in 1 Timothy 2.
[time=2811] Verse 1, "In treaties, prayers, petitions, and thanksgiving." And if there is any salient feature in the prayers of Paul, as you read them in the New Testament, it is this thankful heart.
[time=2822] To the Romans in 1 verse 8, he said, "I thank my God, because your faith is being proclaimed." To the Corinthian church in 1 Corinthians 1, 4, I thank my God for the grace of God, which was given you in Christ Jesus.
[time=2837] To the saints at Philippi and Philippians 1, 3, I thank my God and view of your participation in the gospel.
[time=2843] Colossians 1, 3, we give thanks to God since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus.
[time=2849] To the saints at Thessalonica, 1 Thessalonians 1, 2, we give thanks to God bearing in mind your work of faith.
[time=2857] In other words, Paul was constantly saying, thank you to God for the faith that he saw in those to whom he had evangelized.
[time=2865] He knew it wasn't his doing.
[time=2866] He knew this was the sovereign work of God that brought forth faith in the life and heart of these people.
[time=2871] And as such, he was overwhelmed by an incredible sense of gratitude.
[time=2874] And almost every time he opened his lips and recorded it for us in Scripture, it was thankfulness for salvation, thankfulness for salvation.
[time=2883] He recognized God was the author of salvation, and so should we.
[time=2887] So we pray.
[time=2889] We pray specifically, we pray generally, we pray with passion as we intercede, and we thank God.
[time=2895] For those he has brought to Christ, and for those he will.
[time=2897] We thank him for the salvation provision in Christ.
[time=2900] We thank him for the missionaries.
[time=2902] We thank him for everything we can think of with respect to evangelism.
[time=2907] So the priority of evangelistic prayer, first of all then, the pattern of evangelistic prayer and treaties, prayers, petitions, and thanksgiving.
[time=2915] And lastly, this morning, the parameters of evangelistic
[time=2922] praying, who does it encompass?
[time=2925] Notice it says at the end of verse 1, be made on behalf of all men, all men.
[time=2932] And it sounds so easy, but as we look at our prayer lives,
[time=2938] we so often pray only for people who are immediately in our own lives.
[time=2943] It is so rare that we stop and take time to even be informed enough to pray for the people groups of the world.
[time=2951] He says here to pray for kings.
[time=2953] As an example, the king at this time was Nero.
[time=2956] He was a diabolical murderer.
[time=2959] God says, open your heart enough inside the great commission to encompass even a man like Nero who makes your life difficult and who will eventually persecute the church like none other.
[time=2968] Open your heart to all those who are in authority, all those that work for him, all of his representatives that come and hurt your life and take your possessions.
[time=2978] You'll notice at the end of verse 7, the Gentiles are mentioned.
[time=2981] And here again is the incredible reality that God has from the beginning been trying to save the entire world.
[time=2990] And the Jews always consistently failed to capture the universality of their mission.
[time=2996] That wasn't just the Jews for the Jews' sake.
[time=2998] It wasn't just the nation of Israel for the sake of the nation of Israel.
[time=3001] It was always that nation for all the other nations of the world, and they refused to understand it.
[time=3006] They delighted in the blessings of God and really could care less if anybody else had those same blessings.
[time=3011] And when God blessed them, they just became increasingly sinful.
[time=3014] And Jonah is a perfect example of that.
[time=3017] Jonah, go to the city of Nineveh, these Gentiles, and preach the gospel.
[time=3021] And Jonah said, forget it, man, I don't want to do that.
[time=3024] Those are heathens.
[time=3025] Those are Gentiles.
[time=3026] They're not the Israelites.
[time=3028] They're not the Jewish people.
[time=3030] So he went the wrong way.
[time=3031] He ran the opposite way.
[time=3032] God fetched him in a fish and landed him back on the shore.
[time=3036] And he went to the city of Nineveh, and he preached the gospel.
[time=3039] And a horrible thing happened.
[time=3043] Everybody repented.
[time=3045] Everybody got saved in the entire city.
[time=3047] And it depressed him so much.
[time=3050] Almost committed suicide.
[time=3051] He was so upset over the fact that all these heathens should come to Christ.
[time=3057] And it's so easy to rant and rave about that with respect to the nation of Israel.
[time=3060] But again, we look at our own lives and how much passion and how much intercession is there in our lives for the people of the world.
[time=3067] People who look differently than we are.
[time=3069] People who come and live in our country and change our culture and smell differently and eat different foods and people that might even be a threat to us economically or on a military level.
[time=3081] Do we pray for their salvation?
[time=3083] Are we engrossed in the will of God for their life?
[time=3086] That they should become saved even at the expense of our own nation and our own wealth and our own comfort?
[time=3095] Solomon, when he was dedicating the temple, called the people together and prayed this great prayer.
[time=3100] And part of it, he says this also concerning the foreigner, who is not of thy people Israel.
[time=3107] When he comes from afar country for thy name's sake, for they will hear thy great name and thy mighty hand and of thy outstretched arm.
[time=3115] When he comes and prays towards this house, hear thou in heaven and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to thee in order that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people Israel.
[time=3131] That they may know that this house, which I have built is called by thy name.
[time=3135] When he gathers him together, he reminds them, if he only for a brief moment of their ultimate destiny as the nation of Israel, now that this temple and all of its splendor and glory has been erected, be reminded people that we are here to save the peoples of the world.
[time=3150] They, of course, failed in that mission.
[time=3153] They gave their hearts to idolatry and to the pagan worship of false gods and other lands and God eventually split the kingdom.
[time=3160] And it was brought to basically nothing, had no impact on the cause of Christ.
[time=3166] So we are to pray.
[time=3170] First and foremost, we are to pray.
[time=3174] What are we to pray for?
[time=3175] Salvation of all men.
[time=3177] Why?
[time=3178] Because it calls us back to our mission.
[time=3181] It reminds us of why we exist.
[time=3183] It gives us meaning.
[time=3185] It helps us to find all the other functions in the church.
[time=3188] How?
[time=3190] How are we to pray?
[time=3191] Specifically, generally with passion and with thanksgiving in our hearts.
[time=3196] For whom?
[time=3199] For all men.
[time=3200] For all men, everywhere.
[time=3204] (congregation laughing) I had an experience five years ago in Korea that I can't shake.
[time=3211] I can see it in my mind's eye as vividly right now as when I was there.
[time=3215] I'm so thankful for it.
[time=3216] But it haunts me, it plagues me, it chases me around.
[time=3221] I went into a church, sanctuary sat 25,000 people.
[time=3227] We see it basically 2,000, 25,000 people at one time.
[time=3234] They had to hold multiple services all day Sunday because the church had 600,000 members.
[time=3241] It's the largest church in the world pastored by Pastor Cho.
[time=3245] I showed up there on a Friday night at 10 o'clock.
[time=3249] In my estimation, was there about 15,000 people in that room?
[time=3254] And they were fellow shipping.
[time=3255] It looked like I couldn't understand their language.
[time=3258] So I just figured they were fellow shipping 'cause there was a buzz in the room, you know?
[time=3261] Then I started to identify particular couples and at dawn on me, they weren't fellow shipping.
[time=3267] They were praying.
[time=3268] The official prayer service didn't start for a half an hour.
[time=3272] It would run from 10 30 until 4 a.m.
[time=3274] They don't get Saturday off.
[time=3277] They got out at four so they could go home, shower, shave, get a bite that you can go back to work the next day.
[time=3282] They did it every Friday night from 10 30 to four.
[time=3289] They prayed for the salvation of souls.
[time=3292] You ever wonder what would happen if we did that here at Blackhawk?
[time=3301] Yeah, we'd get a new pastor.
[time=3304] What would happen if we came out at 10 30 on Friday night
[time=3313] on a regular basis and filled this auditorium with people who were not fellow shipping but praying for the salvation of the souls of men?
[time=3324] I don't know.
[time=3326] Aren't you curious?
[time=3329] Don't you wonder?
[time=3330] Isn't there something in you that stirs at the thought of being so closely knit to the great commission and the heartbeat of God?
[time=3337] Well, our staff talked about this on Wednesday.
[time=3343] I want you to know to be here this Friday night.
[time=3345] No, just kidding.
[time=3347] In fact, we're going to take a little step before we try to run.
[time=3351] What we want to do is we want to take this coming Sunday night service, not tonight but the following Sunday.
[time=3358] That's December 1st.
[time=3359] That's when the tree starts to go up in this very sanctuary when we can stop using this platform because the tree's getting built.
[time=3365] I've never seen that, but I've heard about that.
[time=3367] That happens that Sunday afternoon and by that evening service we'll have part of a tree in here.
[time=3371] And do you realize when you think about it?
[time=3373] This is the season, isn't it?
[time=3374] For Jesus Christ to be lifted up and we can talk about Jesus with everybody now for the next few weeks, easier than we can at any other time of the year.
[time=3382] And when you figure that our pride and joy, the living Christmas tree, 25,000 tickets, 20,000 people filling this place right here.
[time=3390] Many of them don't know Jesus Christ.
[time=3392] What do you say we pause?
[time=3405] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir with soloist Marilyn Wong and a special number by Keith Brodigam.
[time=3414] The message today was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3418] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3425] Let's bow together.
[time=3427] Our dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3435] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3438] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed to be my Savior today.
[time=3443] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3445] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3451] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3458] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the booklet entitled, A Family Advent Celebration, please write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
