[time=699] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today I hope that this has been a good holiday weekend for you as you joined with your family and friends and thanksgiving to the Lord what he's done in your life in the last year while we're heavily into the holiday season here at Blackhawk Baptist Church and besides the Bible hour we have a lot of programs that are involved particularly in our Sunday evenings Russell we have a unique program coming tonight that I just thought we need to talk about because last Sunday your message was so strong on prayer and the need for it and tonight we're
[time=731] having a concert of prayer at our church that's right Peter and we're excited about it it seems as if the Lord is just walking us right into this concert of prayer and for those of you who don't know a concert of prayer is probably 40 to 50 minutes in length and it has the way we'll do it for sections a time for adoration and then confession and then thanksgiving and then finally supplication and well with the Christmas tree coming and I guess about 20,000 people going to be in our church some of them aren't going to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior and so we thought we needed a pause and really lift them up before the Lord and evangelistic praying even as the Bible is instructing us to do that we're excited and that will be a special night as well because part of the Christmas tree will be constructed right in our sanctuary so we'll be praying with that as a prompter of what's coming in the Christmas tree.
[time=781] This is the week for the construction many hands will join together and as you mentioned the steel will be up as of tonight in our service our platform won't look the same but it will be a great reminder that there are a lot of people coming that are hurting and need the Savior and certainly this is a great season to tell them about the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. We also have a Christmas Eve service that we'd like to tell you about that's on December 24th at 7 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church be about an hour long and Russell we usually have some real good music that night and then we go into a candlelight communion service and very very significant for that time of the year.
[time=819] Well communion of course is just a wonderful time that the Lord has given to the church to examine our own hearts and confess our sin and the way we do that here is just with meditative songs
[time=831] as we kind of move through the communion service and give people time to pray in the sanctuary of their own heart and read a scripture or two to prompt their mind in those directions.
[time=841] It's a blessed time.
[time=842] I think it's a great opportunity while we do sing and we do things together.
[time=847] There's an appropriate time and enough time to just individually commune with the Lord and really get our hearts right. So that's a great evening if you don't have a service at your church.
[time=857] Once again that's Christmas Eve December 24th at 7 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=864] Well we have a gift offer for you for the month of December that we'd like to have you respond to
[time=870] and write for right away because it is a daily calendar that you can read a verse for a particular day.
[time=878] It's called The Daily Walk Bible Calendar and each day has a tear-off sheet
[time=884] and you are able to read a scripture verse, have a thought for the day,
[time=890] and then there is a process by which you can read through the entire Bible in one year.
[time=895] It's great for your desk or for your kitchen counter so you can be reminded that you can read God's Word every day.
[time=903] We'd like to send you this calendar and you can receive it by writing to the Bible hour,
[time=909] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=916] Just ask for the Daily Walk Bible Calendar and once again the address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=929] Also we mentioned the Concert of Prayer and in conjunction with that, perhaps many of our viewers remember Rick and Kathy Hawks and know that they have been in politics.
[time=940] They've been preaching for a number of months here in various churches and Rick just recently accepted the senior pastorate at the South Baptist Church in Lansing, Michigan.
[time=950] He's going to be with us here tonight and we're going to pray and ask God's blessing on his ministry there.
[time=955] We are anxious to see what God is going to do in that church because we love and Rick and Kathy
[time=962] and believe in their ministry and I know God's going to do a dynamite work so while we're going to miss them here in Fort Wayne area, we're happy that God has chosen to take them to Lansing, Michigan to minister those people.
[time=974] So we wish Pastor Rick and Kathy and their family the best as they go to Lansing, Michigan,
[time=980] and Michigan beginning on December 8th. We go back now to the live portion of our program with the music from Dave and Debbie Johnson and then the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=991] And one of our elders Bob Mansfield is coming to pray for us.
[time=997] Let us pray together.
[time=1004] Father, I pray that as Christians you would give us balance and perspective in our lives.
[time=1009] As we're in the middle of a holiday season that you would allow us to focus on Jesus Christ
[time=1016] and the spiritual aspects of the season and not just the materialistic.
[time=1019] Father, as we're in the middle of a building program, I pray that you give us the ability to focus on the ministry capabilities that we would have with the new building and not just the brick and mortar.
[time=1030] Father, as we come together to worship you and to praise you, to pray that you give our minds the ability to dismiss everything from the outside world and again to focus on you, to worship you, to praise you.
[time=1042] And now Father, as we give our ties and our offering, we pray again that we wouldn't be concerned with the mechanics of giving but that our attitude, our heart would be correct.
[time=1052] That we're praising you, we're thanking you for what you've done in our lives already and we're just returning a portion that sure is anyway.
[time=1059] Father, take these monies, use them as you see fit for it's in Jesus' name we pray with thanksgiving. Amen.
[time=1069] [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=1200] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1202] Amen. Thank you. Thank you, Dave and Debbie. Beautiful.
[time=1207] Well, I'll invite you to take your Bible this morning and open it to
[time=1217] 1 Timothy chapter 2 as we return to this study on praying for the lost and I have to confess how thankful I am
[time=1226] for the continued privilege of studying the Word of God and especially as we come to passages such as these
[time=1233] they somehow work their way into my heart and mind in a very unique way and this passage has certainly done that.
[time=1240] We're talking about praying for the lost and the apostle Paul is writing to the church at Ephesus. It's being
[time=1250] overseen at this time by his number one disciple Timothy. He says in chapter 3 verse 15 that I am writing so that
[time=1257] you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God. Paul is going to give a series of
[time=1264] instruction to this church as to how they ought to conduct themselves in public worship and in other ways and he lists
[time=1272] here prayer women in the church in chapter 3. He talks about deacons and elders and their qualifications and their ministry.
[time=1281] He goes on in chapter 5 to talk about older women and widows and caring for the needy. He goes on in chapter 6 to talk
[time=1289] about masters and slaves and work relationships. Also in chapter 6 to talk about money and materialism there is a
[time=1297] whole list of things that he wants to discuss with this church at Ephesus by way of putting them in order.
[time=1304] But the most important thing that he wants to say to them he begins with in verse 1 of chapter 2 and he marks it as such by
[time=1311] saying first of all then. First of all then not this is the first in a list of things I want to say to you this is the most
[time=1318] important thing that I have to say to you out of that entire list. This is it. This is the most important thing.
[time=1325] Let's read these eight verses and set this passage in our minds. First of all then I urge that in treaties and prayers,
[time=1334] petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men. For kings and all who are in authority in order that we may lead
[time=1342] a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior who desires all
[time=1351] men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator also between God
[time=1359] and men the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all the testimony born at the proper time.
[time=1366] And for this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
[time=1374] Therefore I want the men in every place to pray lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension.
[time=1381] And we are discovering from this passage all different kinds of important elements about praying for the lost.
[time=1388] Not the least of which is this first of all or the priority of praying for the lost.
[time=1394] And we raised the question last Lord's day how is it that this idea of praying evangelistically can be more important
[time=1401] than all of these other things he goes on to describe such as the woman's role or elders or deacons or the care for a widow.
[time=1407] How can this one be the most important?
[time=1411] And we found the answer to be in the fact that by calling them to pray for the salvation of all men
[time=1417] he is calling them back to their main purpose of existence.
[time=1421] The church is on the planet to win souls for Christ to advance the kingdom of God to reach the lost for Jesus Christ.
[time=1429] And by calling them back to pray for that he not only calls them back to that mission but to revive that mission in their hearts
[time=1437] to the extent that they can actually pray for it.
[time=1439] That it flows out of their daily walk with God is this concern for the salvation of men's souls.
[time=1446] We are reaffirmed then that the church is not primarily a social organization although we have tremendous fellowship here.
[time=1454] It is not just an educational organization. We do educate.
[time=1458] We do teach the word here in our ABFs in our Sunday schools and our school.
[time=1462] We do educate but that is not our primary reason for existence.
[time=1466] We are not primarily a philanthropic organization though we do help the poor and we do give to the needy.
[time=1472] We are certainly not a business for profit. We are not here to make money.
[time=1477] Instead we understand that our mission is to be aggressive. It is to penetrate the world with the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1485] It is to reproduce ourselves as an organism not an organization.
[time=1489] We are instead the body of Christ, a living changing dynamic organism not an organization.
[time=1495] And we exist to advance the kingdom of God through the propagation of the gospel of Jesus Christ under the ends of the earth.
[time=1502] That is what Paul reaffirms for the church at Ephesus and for the church at Blackhawk when he says first of all then
[time=1509] most important I want you to be praying for the salvation of souls.
[time=1513] And as we understand and remind it and take a hold again with our heart and our emotions and our will and all that we are
[time=1520] that we exist for evangelism and for discipleship and to extend the gospel to the ends of the earth
[time=1526] then and only then do we understand our roles in that process.
[time=1531] And so the woman's role can be clarified once we are reminded that we are here to advance the kingdom of God.
[time=1537] And the elder's role can be established and his qualifications as well as the deacons can be communicated
[time=1543] because it fits underneath the clear objective.
[time=1546] Once an organization or an organism loses its primary sense of purpose and its direction
[time=1552] all these other roles will become skewed and misdirected and out of proportion and there will be no way for them to properly serve as they ought.
[time=1560] So he calls us back to our mission not just to be reminded of it but to pray for it.
[time=1565] How? How are we to pray for the salvation of souls?
[time=1568] And he goes on then to explain the pattern of praying for the lost in verse 1.
[time=1573] Four synonyms are listed in treaties, prayers, petitions and thanksgivings.
[time=1579] They mean basically the same thing but each has its nuance.
[time=1582] In treaties the first word there is talking about specific petitions.
[time=1586] Praying for the lost by name under aware of their circumstances and their trials and their hardships and their blessings and calling upon the God of salvation to save their souls with specific information as we beseech him on their behalf.
[time=1602] The next word is prayers and that is the general word in the New Testament that describes general prayer
[time=1608] and therefore in this context praying for the salvation of people in general.
[time=1612] People whose names we don't know but we know they live in Russia.
[time=1615] We know they live in Jamaica. We know they live in the inner city.
[time=1617] We know they are a particular ethnic group.
[time=1619] We know they have particular dynamics in their community and so we pray for them not knowing their names but knowing about them in general.
[time=1626] We ask that God would open their eyes of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1630] The next word, the third word is petitions and it could be translated as in some versions
[time=1636] intercession to intercede and here is the passion of our prayer for the lost.
[time=1641] This is the groaning of Romans 8 as the Holy Spirit brings words and articulates our own feelings which are too deep for words.
[time=1648] And it describes you and I understanding the plight of the lost.
[time=1652] They don't understand how lost they are. They are still lost.
[time=1655] They don't know what they need to pray for themselves.
[time=1657] They don't understand it. We've been saved. We've come out of that.
[time=1660] We can pray with passion for them as we intercede before the Father for we have been delivered from their very fate.
[time=1666] And then thanksgiving, we honor God as the author of salvation.
[time=1671] He is the one who has designed it and orchestrates it and leads it and has provided for it.
[time=1675] And so we thank Him for the salvation of souls that have come to Christ and for those who will come to Christ, even as Paul so repeatedly did in his own prayer life.
[time=1683] So the priority of praying for the lost, first of all then, the pattern of praying for the lost is described in these four synonyms and then the parameters of praying for the lost.
[time=1695] Who should we pray for? How wide? How broad should our boundaries be in these prayers for the lost?
[time=1701] And it says at the end of verse one, all men, everybody.
[time=1704] Don't leave anybody out without respect for color, race, creed, language, eating habits, hygiene habits.
[time=1711] Get them all inside your heart. Why? Because they're all within the heart of God. Look at verse four.
[time=1717] God desires all men to be saved and so should we. The scope and the parameters and the extent
[time=1725] to which His desire and longing for the salvation reaches to all men and so should our prayers.
[time=1731] So that by way of review. This morning we come to look particularly at verses two, three, and four.
[time=1740] And we find at the beginning of verse two a principle, the lifestyle, the lifestyle of praying for the lost.
[time=1747] And I want you to notice the progression of thought as it is described in verse two.
[time=1751] He says pray for kings and all who are in authority. Those are all the people who work for the kings.
[time=1756] In other words, pray for your government. Pray for your government. What should you pray for them?
[time=1761] Well, it's there. In order that, that's a little phrase that tells you the purpose.
[time=1766] In order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=1773] Here we begin to pray for our kings and those in authority, not specifically for their salvation.
[time=1779] That's already been prayed for under all men. There's another category for which we pray for our kings and those in authority, our government.
[time=1786] We pray this way. God not only save them, but pray for their administration the way they run this country.
[time=1793] That they will do with their government what governments are supposed to do.
[time=1797] And what is that? Punish evildoers. Punish evildoers. Basically, the Bible clearly teaches in Romans 13
[time=1805] that God establishes and ordains the government so that it can punish evildoers, so that it will be the wrath of God on people who break the law.
[time=1814] So in addition to praying for the salvation of the king and the salvation of the king's men, pray for the administration of the king and the king's men so that they will do what they're supposed to do, which is to punish evildoers. Why?
[time=1826] So that you and I can lead a tranquil and quiet life. What do those words mean?
[time=1831] Free from distraction and interruption from the out that's tranquil and from within, quiet.
[time=1837] That our lives will be at peace both from without and from within because their administration makes that possible.
[time=1844] Obviously on the physical, not the spiritual level. Why?
[time=1849] So that we can look at it again at the end of verse two so that we can live godliness and dignity,
[time=1856] live a life of godliness and dignity.
[time=1859] The word godliness talks about the inner attitude or the disposition of a saint, a person who is wholly devoted to Christ.
[time=1866] It talks about a real love for God on the inside.
[time=1870] It shows itself in a dignified life, in dignity or moral and chaste, respectable behavior.
[time=1879] So we are encouraged to pray, pray for the governing authorities that their administration will be exercised in such a way that we will be free both from disturbance from without and from within.
[time=1891] That they will do what they're supposed to do, punish evildoers so that our godly lifestyle can be put on display.
[time=1899] You say, is there any precedence for that?
[time=1901] Is there any precedence in the scripture for us to pray for the governing authorities so that they will have an administration which is suitable for our lifestyle to be evangelistic?
[time=1910] Answer, yes.
[time=1912] Proverbs 21.1 starts the whole thing off by saying this.
[time=1915] The king's heart is like channels of water in the hand of the Lord. He turns it wherever he wishes.
[time=1922] The furrows of the farmer are in view and the water runs down these until the farmer says, no, I want him to go down these so he barricades or blocks these and the water shifts and runs down the other.
[time=1932] It's just that easy.
[time=1933] That's how easy it is for God to change the channel of a king's heart, for God to change their administration to make it suitable and peaceable and tranquil and quiet.
[time=1943] We are encouraged to pray for them because God runs them, God oversees all that.
[time=1948] Now in particular, we could look at the Babylonian exile because there are many different instances when the Israelites are in the Babylonian exile that they are encouraged to pray for their government.
[time=1958] Jeremiah 29.7, let me read it to you.
[time=1961] The people in exile are encouraged this and seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile and pray to the Lord on its behalf.
[time=1971] For in its welfare, you will have welfare.
[time=1975] While you're in exile, pray.
[time=1977] Pray for the welfare of your city.
[time=1979] Pray for the welfare of the governing authorities because when they benefit, you benefit.
[time=1983] When they prosper, you'll prosper.
[time=1985] It gets more specific.
[time=1987] Cyrus is in fact called in Isaiah 44, 28 by God.
[time=1993] God says of Cyrus, he is my shepherd.
[time=1997] This is a pagan king.
[time=1999] This is a king who does not know God.
[time=2002] He is not saved, does not express his faith in the Yahweh.
[time=2006] Later in chapter 45, verse 1, he is called an anointed one, which is the word for Messiah.
[time=2013] God calls Cyrus his shepherd and his Messiah.
[time=2018] Why?
[time=2019] Because Cyrus was being used by God for the benefit of Israel in his decree that they should return to their homeland.
[time=2026] So here a pagan king is referred to as a shepherd and as a Messiah because of the benevolence in his heart that God had placed there for the people of God.
[time=2035] In Ezra 6, 10, Darius is speaking and he's promising the people of Israel to be repaid in full as they reconstruct their temple.
[time=2043] In other words, the national treasury will buy a new temple for the nation of Israel.
[time=2048] Why?
[time=2049] This is Darius speaking.
[time=2050] That they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
[time=2058] And that's what they did.
[time=2060] And of course later, Nehemiah 1, 11, Nehemiah before king Artaxerxes is praying this way, "Oh Lord, I beseech thee.
[time=2068] May thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to revere thy name,
[time=2076] and make thy servant successful today and grant him compassion before this man."
[time=2082] This man of course was King Artaxerxes.
[time=2086] So we are to be praying, praying with good precedence, praying not only for the salvation of our leaders, but praying for their administration.
[time=2095] That we would have a life that is not hindered by an oppressive and antagonistic government.
[time=2101] That the energies and time and resources specifically of the people of this church can go to the propagation of the gospel,
[time=2109] not to trying to defend themselves from evil doers.
[time=2114] Because the evil doers, for the most part, are punished in this nation, we can meet this morning and our houses aren't being robbed.
[time=2121] And our cars aren't being robbed.
[time=2125] And we can freely meet with a peace of mind.
[time=2127] It is a tranquil and quiet environment.
[time=2130] And what he is saying is use that atmosphere that is created by the government that punishes the evil doer to live a godly life,
[time=2138] to live a godly lifestyle, to let the godliness within you, the attitude of reverence and awe and worship of a holy and righteous God,
[time=2145] find its way out in your behavior as you live a life of dignity and its compelling and attractive and convicting to those around you.
[time=2153] To be Christ-like.
[time=2160] So we are more than model citizens, we are Christ-like citizens, and we are the friend of government.
[time=2165] We are not antagonistic to them, we are supportive of them.
[time=2168] In fact, we're praying for them, for their salvation and their administration.
[time=2174] You see, now wait a minute, is the only time that the gospel can go forward is when the government provides a tranquil and quiet environment, is that it?
[time=2185] And you know from church history, no, that's not how it works.
[time=2189] Oftentimes the record of church history is very clear that the gospel actually flourishes under persecution, it thrives.
[time=2197] We could read the book of Acts and find that the gospel was literally kicked out of Jerusalem by persecution with the stoning of Stephen,
[time=2205] and the saints began to be scattered throughout the surrounding areas and with them went the gospel, and it was all a part of God's plan to propagate the gospel to the foreign parts of that region.
[time=2216] The life of Paul was filled with oppression and persecution by the governing authorities,
[time=2222] as their arms were being twisted by the Jewish authorities, and as he was being alleged to be an insurrectionist,
[time=2228] and to be unsupportive of the government, which wasn't true, except for, he said, "Worship God not Caesar."
[time=2235] But they trumped up hundreds of charges against him, and his life was full of persecution, and he was literally run from one city to the next, as God would have the gospel be spread.
[time=2245] We could think of World War II when the whole world seemed to be at war, certainly not tranquil and quiet on a worldwide level,
[time=2254] but the American GIs that were sent over to Asia to kill and to defend and to fight many of those believers there fell in love with the people of Asia,
[time=2263] and after the war was over, returned again as missionaries and started some of the strongest missionary agencies we know of,
[time=2269] reaching Asia today. All of that comes out of a time that is not tranquil and quiet.
[time=2275] Even the war in the Gulf gives us great example of how God can use hardship in men's lives
[time=2281] to bring them to the gospel as we think of our own GIs as they were down in the desert waiting for who knows what,
[time=2287] possibly chemical welfare, possibly atomic warfare, without the normal distractions of the American culture,
[time=2295] as they were in a very closed society and they were left there to think about life and death for months on end,
[time=2301] and faithful men brought the gospel and the New Testaments, and thousands and thousands of young men came to Christ under that sense of hardship.
[time=2310] So yes, the gospel goes forward under persecution.
[time=2314] God has in the past and will again greatly use the persecution of the saints for the propagation of the gospel,
[time=2320] but that is not what we're called to pray for. We don't pray for that kind of stuff.
[time=2324] We pray that our kings and those in authority will let us live a tranquil and quiet life so our godliness and our dignity can be put on display.
[time=2334] Better than in times of peace, we would use our freedom to organize and strategize the gospel into people's lives,
[time=2342] build new buildings and have schools and Sunday school classes and meet on Sunday morning and disciple
[time=2348] and be involved in the long process of training up a godly generation that can be used of the Lord.
[time=2354] So we are in our understanding of the government to remember Romans 12, 18 and it says if possible,
[time=2361] so far as it depends on you, be at peace with all men.
[time=2364] We should not be viewed negatively by the government.
[time=2367] We should be viewed as submissive, compliant, supportive citizens that are not only praying for their salvation, but the success of their administration as God defines it.
[time=2377] We are to have a whimsical, peaceable, attractive Christian life.
[time=2383] And no one should miss the point of our existence.
[time=2386] No one should miss the point of our existence. We are here to save souls.
[time=2390] We are here to advance the kingdom of God.
[time=2394] Then moving past that into verses three and four, we come to point number four, the will of God in praying evangelistically.
[time=2401] The will, and this is so exciting, and the magnitude of this truth is so overwhelming, my prayer for you this week has been
[time=2408] that you would not let your familiarity with it rob you of the magnitude of the truth in these two verses.
[time=2413] Sometimes familiarity breeds indifference.
[time=2415] You know that God desires a salvation of all men.
[time=2418] You know that God is a saving God.
[time=2420] But listen to it again and allow the spirit to strike your heart new and afresh with his tremendous desire to see men come to himself.
[time=2430] He begins this way in verse three, "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior."
[time=2436] Do you realize that when you and I stop and we pray for the salvation of all men, God calls it first of all good,
[time=2444] colon in the Greek, which means intrinsically morally right.
[time=2448] It's suitable, it's righteous behavior, it's good stuff.
[time=2452] He says, "Yeah, it gets good." And then he says it's acceptable, which literally translated means to applaud, to receive with great joy.
[time=2462] When you and I stop and pray for the salvation of the souls of the lost, God is metaphorically applauding that.
[time=2469] He's so excited about it, it's like when you hear a great song and something inside you just applaud that.
[time=2475] That's how God feels about it.
[time=2477] That's what God is saying.
[time=2479] And this word acceptable is used in the context of worship.
[time=2483] Oftentimes in the New Testament he'll call our worship acceptable.
[time=2486] Romans 12, 1 and 2 calls, uses the word acceptable, Philippians 4, 18.
[time=2492] Speaking of the offering that Paul was receiving from some of the saints, he says, "I've received from a paphrodite is what you have sent a fragrant aroma." Think of the Old Testament, that sacrificial lingo.
[time=2504] And acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.
[time=2508] It's the same thing.
[time=2510] When you and I pray for the salvation of the souls, we're not just praying, we are worshiping God at the highest possible level as he is applauding that activity and receiving it as a sweet smelling aroma and sacrifice as it fills his nostrils.
[time=2523] 1 Peter 2.5 says, "We are living stones, being built together as a spiritual house, as a holy priesthood."
[time=2531] And what are we to do with that?
[time=2533] Offer up acceptable sacrifices to God through Jesus Christ.
[time=2537] Praying for the lost is one of those acceptable sacrifices.
[time=2540] It's not the only one, but it's one of them.
[time=2542] One of the ways that you and I can experience and exercise our spiritual priesthood of the New Testament
[time=2548] is to regularly pause and pray for the lost and God will applaud that.
[time=2553] You say, "Why?" Why does God think that's so good?
[time=2557] Why does God get so excited that he bursts forth in applause when we stop and pray for the lost?
[time=2563] Well look, verse 3, "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior."
[time=2569] Here God is called the God our Savior.
[time=2572] Look at chapter 1 verse 1.
[time=2574] He is called that same thing again.
[time=2576] God our Savior.
[time=2578] See it, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus who is our hope.
[time=2586] Over and over and over again in the New Testament, God the Father is referred to as God our Savior.
[time=2595] He is so noted in 1 Timothy 4, 10, 1 Thessalonians 5, 9.
[time=2600] Titus 1, 3, the commandment of God our Savior.
[time=2604] Titus 3, 4, "But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared He saved us,
[time=2610] not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy." God is a God of salvation.
[time=2618] He is God our Savior.
[time=2622] Come with me back to Isaiah.
[time=2624] Isaiah chapter 45, and let me show you the extent to which God sees Himself as God our Savior.
[time=2634] Isaiah chapter 45 verses 21 and following.
[time=2644] It says here declare verse 21, Isaiah 45 declare and set forth your case.
[time=2656] Indeed, let them consult together.
[time=2659] Who has announced this from of old?
[time=2662] Who has long since declared it?
[time=2664] Is it not I the Lord?
[time=2665] Now listen.
[time=2666] And there is no other God besides me.
[time=2669] A righteous God and a Savior, there is none except me.
[time=2674] Turn to me and be saved all the ends of the earth for I am God and there is no other.
[time=2683] Not only is God our Savior, He is the only Savior.
[time=2687] It says if He's saying if people around the world are ever going to get saved, they're only going to get saved through me for there is no other except me.
[time=2697] There is no other God who can save.
[time=2699] I am the only God who can save.
[time=2703] And then look at the terrifying news in verse 23.
[time=2707] I have sworn by myself.
[time=2710] The word has gone forth from my mouth in righteousness and will not turn back that to me every knee will bow, every tongue will swear allegiance.
[time=2721] And there's two times that you get to do that.
[time=2723] Once when you're alive as you choose to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and you confess Him as such and you bow the knee of your heart and with your tongue you confess Jesus Christ as Lord.
[time=2736] And if you don't do it then then you die in your sin and you do it by compulsion at the end of the age when you will bow before Him whether or not you've been saved or not and confess Him as Lord.
[time=2746] Philippians 2-10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.
[time=2759] Everybody's going to do it.
[time=2763] Some of us will do it at the point of salvation before we die others will do it by divine decree and demand and order at the end of the age and then it's too late.
[time=2778] So come back with me now to 1 Timothy as we keep thinking about this great and awesome God who desires all men to come to salvation.
[time=2790] We see a progression of thought that is staggering.
[time=2794] He's saying pray for the salvation of all men, pray for your government so you can live evangelistically.
[time=2800] When you do that I call it good and I applaud it.
[time=2803] It is acceptable worship.
[time=2805] Why?
[time=2806] Because it is consistent with my character.
[time=2808] I am a saving God.
[time=2810] And I'll look at verse 4.
[time=2813] Not only is it consistent with his character but it is consistent with his will.
[time=2819] He says I desire who desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=2827] And the word here for desire is fellow in the Greek.
[time=2832] The word fellow and it reflects his will of desire springing from his feelings.
[time=2839] Springing from his inclinations.
[time=2841] This is the longing of his heart.
[time=2843] This is the wish and the hope, the anticipation, the desire of his heart.
[time=2851] It's reflected in Ezekiel 1823.
[time=2854] Let me just read it to you.
[time=2856] He says do I have any pleasure in the death of the wicked?
[time=2859] Declares the Lord God.
[time=2861] Rather than that he should turn from his way and live.
[time=2864] For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies.
[time=2868] Therefore repent and live.
[time=2871] He cries out.
[time=2873] He invites.
[time=2874] Repent.
[time=2875] This is the desire of my heart.
[time=2876] I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked.
[time=2879] Ezekiel 3311.
[time=2881] As I live, declares the Lord God.
[time=2883] I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked.
[time=2886] But rather that the wicked turn from his way and live.
[time=2889] Listen.
[time=2890] Turn back.
[time=2891] Turn back from your evil ways.
[time=2895] Why then will you die, O house of Israel?
[time=2898] This is the word for the New Testament word for will that describes the longing of his heart.
[time=2904] It comes out of his passion and his emotion and his longing to see people saved.
[time=2909] You say fantastic.
[time=2911] If God desires everybody to be saved, then everybody will be saved.
[time=2916] Because God always gets what he wants, right?
[time=2919] God is omnipotent.
[time=2921] He's all powerful and if he wants it to happen then it'll happen.
[time=2925] Well I'm sorry that's not true.
[time=2928] That's not true at all.
[time=2929] There are a lot of things that God wills in this sense of the word fellow that he longs for that he desires to happen that simply don't happen.
[time=2939] You can think of illustrations of that in your own life.
[time=2942] Every time you sin, you what?
[time=2945] You break the will of God for your life.
[time=2950] You violate the fellow of God's will for your life, the desire of his will for your life.
[time=2955] That same word fellow is used over in 1 Thessalonians 4-3.
[time=2958] It says this, this is the will of God.
[time=2961] This is the fellow of God, your sanctification.
[time=2965] That is that you abstain from sexual immorality.
[time=2968] Anytime, for example, that a Christian would fall into immorality or an impure thought in a sensual sense, they are violating the fellow of God for their life, the will of God for their life.
[time=2979] Ephesians 5, 17, and 18 talk about the will of God for our lives that we be filled with the Spirit.
[time=2984] That is, under the constant control of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2987] When we step out of the Spirit's control of our lives and function in the flesh, we are out of the will of God.
[time=2992] We are violating the will of God.
[time=2995] There's another word in the New Testament that describes not the will of God as respecting his desire and his hopes, but his actual divine decree.
[time=3004] That's the word bulimai.
[time=3006] Bulimai reflects the will of God coming from precise determination.
[time=3013] Most things never get violated.
[time=3015] Everything that God bulimized happens.
[time=3018] Everything that God chooses to have happen happens.
[time=3020] There is an unviolatable sense of his will with bulimai.
[time=3024] With fellow, it's just the longing.
[time=3026] It's the desire.
[time=3028] And the clear truth of the New Testament is that God does not take his fellow, his desire
[time=3034] for the salvation of all men and crystallize that into his sovereign decree, and by doing so, eliminate the choice and the responsibility of man and salvation.
[time=3044] What you see here is his longing for them.
[time=3046] He has not decreed them to salvation.
[time=3048] He has not bulimized them, but it is an expression of his longing.
[time=3053] Men sin, and men go to hell because they reject Jesus Christ, not because of the predetermined
[time=3061] will of God for them to go to hell.
[time=3063] He calls all men to repent.
[time=3065] You say, "How does that square with the sovereignty of God in salvation?
[time=3069] Is God sovereign in salvation?" Yes.
[time=3072] Does God elect, effectually elect, irresistibly elect?
[time=3075] Yes.
[time=3076] Does God predetermine and predestinate salvation?
[time=3078] Yes.
[time=3079] You say, "How does that all work together?" I believe that God wills them certain men to be saved, and by their choice they are
[time=3089] not saved.
[time=3091] The responsibility is theirs, not gods.
[time=3093] You say, "Harmonize that for me." Make sense out of those two things you just said.
[time=3097] I'll say, "Okay, I will." Our first day in heaven, you come right up to me and ask me.
[time=3103] I'll tell you all about it.
[time=3105] Until then, we don't know.
[time=3108] We don't know.
[time=3109] In one sense, God is absolutely sovereign in the salvation of some.
[time=3113] It goes this way.
[time=3114] He desires everybody to come to Christ and fellow.
[time=3116] He desires everybody, the longing of his heart is for everybody.
[time=3120] There are some, however, that he has predetermined to salvation, not to hell, but to salvation.
[time=3126] Those people get saved.
[time=3128] This other group that reject Christ, they reject Christ, and they're responsible for it.
[time=3133] Doesn't make sense to me either, but that's what the Bible teaches.
[time=3137] We'll understand it, I believe, in heaven.
[time=3140] So God expresses his incredible longing and desire, his emotion, to see all men come to
[time=3146] be saved.
[time=3147] And you know the interesting thing is that in Christ, he has made provision for every single person to come to Christ.
[time=3153] When Jesus says, "Repent and believe in the Son of God," there has been provision made for every single one of them to do that.
[time=3160] In the death of Christ and in the atoning work of Jesus Christ, sacrifice has been made for all of them, and it's God's intense desire to see them come to Christ.
[time=3170] You say, "What does that look like?" That's at the end of verse 4.
[time=3175] Those four little words come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=3180] Come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=3181] That's just another way of saying they got saved.
[time=3184] Knowledge of the truth.
[time=3185] The word truth there is olethea, and it is other places translated reality.
[time=3194] When people get saved, they come to the knowledge of reality.
[time=3198] Well, the reality about what?
[time=3200] Well the reality about who God is, he's holy and righteous.
[time=3204] The reality about who they are, sinful, depraved, deserving of hell.
[time=3208] The reality of Jesus Christ, that he is the Son of God, that he did live a perfect life, that he died on the cross and that they can receive that salvation unto themselves.
[time=3217] That's all truth.
[time=3218] That's all reality.
[time=3219] That stuff is real.
[time=3220] The stuff that isn't real are the lies of Satan that cause people to believe they can work or earn their salvation.
[time=3226] See, that's coming to the knowledge of non-truth, the opposite of all ethea.
[time=3231] When people get saved, they come to the knowledge or epagnosis is the word and it means to receive unto yourself to have a deep inner understanding and receptivity to the truth.
[time=3241] So people get saved when they take unto themselves the truth about God, the truth about Jesus Christ, the truth about themselves, the truth about hell, the truth about heaven, and they accept that, they're saved.
[time=3253] The knowledge of the truth.
[time=3255] John 14, 6, "I am the way, the truth and the life, no man comes unto the Father but by me."
[time=3261] You don't come to the Father unless you come to the truth.
[time=3264] 2 Timothy 2, 25, "God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth."
[time=3272] 2 Timothy 3, 7, Paul talks about the peril of apostasy, people who aren't going to be saved.
[time=3278] Why?
[time=3279] Because they are always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=3285] So the great cry of Paul in this passage is that the church at Ephesus would return to
[time=3292] its first and utmost priority, that it would remind itself of the great commission and pray for the lost.
[time=3299] How?
[time=3300] In treaties, prayers, petitions, and thanksgiving.
[time=3303] How many of the lost?
[time=3305] All of them.
[time=3306] Open your heart as wide as God's heart and pray for all of them.
[time=3310] Have a lifestyle as you pray for your kings and those in authority that allows you to lead a tranquil and quiet life and let the Christ likeness in you come out and use your time and your energy to organize yourself for the propagation of the gospel of Jesus Christ even as we do here at this church.
[time=3327] How does God feel about all that?
[time=3329] He calls it good, absolutely perfect, tremendous, morally excellent behavior.
[time=3334] How does it make him feel?
[time=3336] He applauds it.
[time=3337] He's so thrilled that you've caught his heart.
[time=3340] He's made you new in Christ and now you've caught his heart to the extent that you're praying back to him, his own will, he applauds it.
[time=3348] How bad does he want it?
[time=3349] He longs for it from the deepest part of his being.
[time=3353] He longs to see people come to Christ.
[time=3358] Why?
[time=3359] Because it's consistent with his character.
[time=3360] There is only one God that can save, the God of the Old and the New Testament, God the
[time=3366] Father, the God of Jesus Christ who is himself God.
[time=3395] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and the special music from violinists then violist Dave and Debbie Johnson.
[time=3405] The message today was another in a series by our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3410] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior,
[time=3416] I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3418] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3421] Father, I thank you that you we can come to you today.
[time=3425] I can tell you that I have not lived my life honorably and in accordance with God's Word.
[time=3433] And today I know that I'm a sinner and I need to accept you as my Savior.
[time=3438] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3443] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3446] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3451] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
