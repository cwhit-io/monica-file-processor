[time=0] Don't you just hate it when you can't get the full scoop on a particular event, can't
[time=7] come to the full knowledge of the truth, for example, in the assassination of President Kennedy?
[time=13] What really happened?
[time=14] We don't know.
[time=15] Who was really telling the truth in the Clarence Thomas trial?
[time=18] We still don't know.
[time=19] We may never know.
[time=21] Coming to the knowledge of the truth sometimes is very difficult with world events.
[time=26] But there is one thing, the most important thing in the world that is very clear and the truth is profoundly given in the Word of God.
[time=33] In our text this morning, in 1 Timothy chapter 2, Paul instructs us to come to the knowledge of the truth with respect to the fact that there is one God and one mediator between
[time=43] God and man.
[time=45] Stay with us, won't you?
[time=60] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope
[time=66] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=68] Thank you for joining us.
[time=70] Today Pastor Moore will be presenting the third in a series of messages regarding our responsibility to pray for unbelievers.
[time=77] So often as we listen to the television news or read the newspaper, we feel as if we are not hearing the complete story, the whole truth.
[time=85] However, as we study God's Word today, we can be assured that it provides us with the complete picture.
[time=92] Please have your Bibles open to 1 Timothy chapter 2.
[time=96] Our special music today will be provided by Rejoice.
[time=99] They will be singing Proclaim the Glory.
[time=102] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's listen to the handbell choir as they play a not so familiar Christmas Carol entitled "Coventry Carol."
[time=115] [MUSIC - 202 seconds]
[time=338] [APPLAUSE]
[time=346] Thank you very much handbells.
[time=348] Let's continue now with more music as we sing the chorus on 112 continuing to worship Jesus our Savior.
[time=355] Jesus name above all names.
[time=359] [MUSIC - 59 seconds]
[time=422] Hello and thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=425] And Russell as you and the audience can see we're heavy into the construction of the living Christmas tree.
[time=430] We've been going out for many days and this week the concerts begin.
[time=434] What seems as if the whole sanctuary has been transformed into a living Christmas tree.
[time=439] I've been amazed to watch the construction of it.
[time=441] I had no idea there was so much steel and as the superstructure goes up and in the way you all dress it up and bring in all the sets,
[time=447] it's literally transformed our sanctuary.
[time=450] As you know Pete had a tremendous time last week as we stopped our evening service and didn't have a message or really anything.
[time=456] We just paused and we prayed for the impact that the tree would have on the...
[time=461] How many performances do we have and how does all that work?
[time=465] I know there's thousands of people coming.
[time=467] We actually have ten performances.
[time=469] We have one on Thursday night that's what we call the premier performance.
[time=472] And with the Christian school that's a dinner time with a benefit dinner and then the concert and all of the finances that are raised that evening go for the support of our Christian school.
[time=486] And then the other nine concerts are open to the public.
[time=489] Unfortunately all the tickets are gone but we will assume that there's at least 2,000 people each night or each performance.
[time=497] So it's exciting time and it's neat to see the number of people that don't normally attend church that come and I hope it will be a real inspiring time for them.
[time=506] How many years have we been doing the living Christmas tree?
[time=508] This is the 15th year that we've done the tree.
[time=511] It's hard to believe.
[time=512] I remember when the lights went on the tree the first time in the Convocation Center and what an exciting night that was.
[time=518] But each year there seems to be just an atmosphere of excitement when we get together and as the choir prepares the music and then so many volunteers.
[time=526] Everything is done on a voluntary basis.
[time=528] All of the artwork is done by people in our church that have just jobs around the city and just love to get involved.
[time=536] And I'm really thankful for our volunteers because it's just be impossible to put something of this magnitude on if we didn't have great people who really are interested.
[time=546] So it's a fun time really is.
[time=548] Well looking ahead to some of the events that are taking place at Blackhawk Baptist Church I want to remind you again that we have a Christmas Eve service on December 24th.
[time=557] That's Tuesday night and if your church doesn't have anything or you're not doing much why don't you come to our candlelight communion service.
[time=564] Russell there will be some music and then we'll just have a great time around the Lord's table.
[time=569] I love that time and then our family goes back home and in our case we open presents but some just get together but it is a neat time.
[time=578] Can we wait for our presents until Christmas Eve?
[time=580] I remember I thought the more tradition.
[time=583] And then Russ we have other events that happened during the Christmas season.
[time=589] Looking ahead to the last Sunday in December we'll have a special guest special musical guest sing in our morning service.
[time=595] I don't even know her but her name happens to be Stephanie Moore and I know you're excited.
[time=599] That's right it's my sister my eldest sister I have three sisters and Stephanie's the eldest.
[time=603] She teaches elementary school out in Southern California in a secular setting and has a tremendous impact for the cause of Christ there.
[time=610] And she also ministers in music at Lake Avenue Congregational Church in Pasadena.
[time=614] So I've twisted her arm and she's going to come out Christmas Day and stay a couple of weeks with us.
[time=619] We're looking forward to seeing her again and I guess she'll have an opportunity to sing in the services as well.
[time=624] That's great we're looking forward to her ministry.
[time=627] And then for those of you to watch the Bible hour over the years Christmas time is a traditional time to introduce our families to our viewing audience.
[time=635] And my family will be on next week and I'm delighted to introduce them to you.
[time=639] And then for most of you this will be the first time that you will see Russell Moore's family.
[time=644] They'll be on the 22nd of December and the week following and so I hope you'll stay tuned and meet our families.
[time=652] We love them and we appreciate our wives and our children and the support that they give us in our ministry here at Blackhawk.
[time=659] Just before we go back to our live portion we have a gift offer that we'd like to give you last week.
[time=664] We mentioned it it's a daily walk calendar and I'm excited about it because I think these are the types of things that get us involved in scripture reading Russ.
[time=673] There's a scripture verse for every day and then there's a passage of scripture that you can read so that if you read every day you could read through the entire Bible in one year and then there's a thought for the day that will encourage you.
[time=686] So you can write for this calendar today.
[time=689] I want to give you the address for that it's the Bible hour.
[time=694] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=701] Once again you can receive your daily walk Bible calendar by writing to the Bible hour.
[time=706] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=714] We go back to the live portion of our program with some more music and then the message from God's word from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=721] I hope that you'll stay tuned with us.
[time=751] The glory of the Lord, let every tongue let fancy raise without his name in praises forever proclaim.
[time=760] The glory of the Lord, make known his mighty deeds.
[time=764] You all take up the call that every nation know.
[time=768] He is our Messiah, our Savior and our King.
[time=773] Let all the voice misjoin us one and dear the earth must sing.
[time=778] Glory to our God, his greatness we applaud.
[time=782] Let every raise on every shore proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=800] He will claim the glory of the Lord, give honor to the Prince of Peace for if we cease the stones we'll start shouting.
[time=809] He will claim the glory of the Lord, with hands uplifted let us raise him.
[time=815] He will claim the praise to him who reigns on high.
[time=818] He is our Messiah, our Savior and our King.
[time=823] Let all the voice misjoin us one and dear the earth must sing.
[time=828] Glory to our God, his greatness we applaud.
[time=832] Let every raise on every shore proclaim the glory of the Lord.
[time=843] The glory of the Lord, he is our Messiah, our Savior and our King.
[time=850] Let all the voice misjoin us one and dear the earth must sing.
[time=854] Glory to our God, his greatness we applaud.
[time=858] Let every raise on every shore proclaim the glory.
[time=865] He will claim the glory, he will claim the glory, he will claim the glory of the Lord.
[time=891] Amen, thank you very much, ladies, proclaim the greatness of our Lord.
[time=897] Well, if you have your Bibles with you this morning, I want to invite you to turn to 1 Timothy chapter 2
[time=903] as we come back to this familiar passage about praying for the lost.
[time=909] This will be our third message on this particular passage of Scripture, and I can assure you that my heart continues to swell with excitement as I understand more and more
[time=920] of God's pattern and plan for us to be praying for the lost.
[time=924] I'll do my best to share with you the truth from this incredible passage.
[time=929] Let me read it again as we just set it in our minds and continue to study it.
[time=933] First of all, then, he says, "I urge that in treaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men, for kings and all who are in authority, in order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity."
[time=951] This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=960] For there is one God, and one mediator also between God and men the man Christ Jesus,
[time=967] who gave himself as a ransom for all the testimony born at the proper time.
[time=973] And for this, I was appointed a preacher and apostle.
[time=977] I am telling the truth.
[time=978] I am not lying as a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
[time=983] Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath and dissension.
[time=991] And quickly, just by way of review, we came last Lord's Day to this phrase at the end of verse 4 that men should come to the knowledge of the truth, and that is what it means to pray evangelistically.
[time=1004] When we stop as a church and pray that the lost should come to Christ, we are ultimately praying that the lost would come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1013] What does that mean?
[time=1015] Knowledge in this particular text means to embrace deeply in the heart and soul of the individual to receive certain truths with gladness and joy, to take them unto yourself, if you will.
[time=1027] The word is "epagnosis," and it's a very strong, powerful, personal word for intimate knowledge and acceptance of those facts as now mine.
[time=1036] And the word truth, all a theia, could have been translated to reality.
[time=1041] We must accept what is real, what is really true about life, and in particular, and where we begin this morning, in verses 5 and 6, two things must be accepted in order for a person to be saved.
[time=1054] Two dimensions of reality must be embraced in this deep personal way before salvation can occur.
[time=1061] What are they? Look at verse 5.
[time=1063] There is one God, and there is one mediator.
[time=1067] If these two facts are not deeply embraced in the heart and soul and breast of a man,
[time=1073] he can never be saved.
[time=1076] You say, explain that to me.
[time=1078] Help me understand why it is so important that salvation embraced the knowledge that there is one God and one mediator.
[time=1087] Well, first, one God, come with me back to Deuteronomy chapter 6.
[time=1092] It is probably better said here than anywhere else.
[time=1096] It is the Shema, which is the Hebrew word for here.
[time=1099] It is affectionately known by the Jewish people as their Shema, and by rabbinic law they were required to memorize it and recite this passage and two others twice a day.
[time=1111] They would take these passages and write them on parchment and hold them in little flactories, which were leather boxes that they would place on their head and on their garments.
[time=1120] But it began in verse 4, Deuteronomy 6, 4, here, Shema, here, O Israel,
[time=1126] the Lord is our God, and here it is, the Lord is one.
[time=1132] The Lord is alone. There is no other Lord.
[time=1137] The word Lord there is Yahweh, and it is a derivative of a verb to be.
[time=1144] He is saying here I am.
[time=1147] It is the same word for God, title for God, that God gave to Moses over in Exodus chapter 3 when he had called Moses to lead the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
[time=1157] And of course, Moses was anticipating the difficulty of that task.
[time=1162] And how was he going to go to the Lord of the earth, Pharaoh, the 19th dynasty, the greatest leader of all Egypt's history?
[time=1171] It's at its pinnacle of political and military strength.
[time=1174] He was the uncontested ruler of the known world this pharaoh was.
[time=1178] And God says to Moses, "You go and lead my people out, and Moses has this question.
[time=1182] Who shall I say sent me?" Who do I tell him sent me?
[time=1187] And God, you remember, says tell him I am sent you.
[time=1191] So what does that mean I am sent you?
[time=1194] And it is without question the most definitive title of God.
[time=1198] For when God says I am that I am, he declares his own self-existence.
[time=1205] He says I have no origin.
[time=1209] I am uncreated.
[time=1213] I have no source.
[time=1216] I have no cause.
[time=1218] Nothing brought me into existence.
[time=1221] Nothing created me.
[time=1223] No factors collided in the universe that suddenly brought me into being.
[time=1227] I have always been.
[time=1229] I am and I always will be.
[time=1231] And I have been in that state of existence without the help or the support or the directive or the cause of any other being.
[time=1238] It is absolutely astounding what he says about himself when he says I am.
[time=1243] Yahweh.
[time=1247] When we think of origin, we can only think of created beings.
[time=1251] When we think of something with origin, we are not thinking of God.
[time=1254] God stands alone.
[time=1256] And as it says in this verse here, oh Israel, the Lord is our God.
[time=1261] The I am is one.
[time=1264] There is only one of him.
[time=1269] You say, so what's the big deal about that?
[time=1272] Well look at verse five.
[time=1274] And this is even a more familiar passage to us.
[time=1277] And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul,
[time=1283] and with all your might.
[time=1286] You know what he's saying?
[time=1289] He's saying, because I am, because I am I am, because I am uncreated.
[time=1294] Because I have no source, no cause.
[time=1297] It demands your absolute total allegiance.
[time=1301] Love and adoration from your heart, your soul, and your might.
[time=1306] Sometimes we'll say we love God not because of the things he does, but because of who he is.
[time=1311] This is it.
[time=1313] We are to acknowledge him as the only uncreated being in all of anything.
[time=1321] And because of that one simple fact, fall at his feet and worship him with all of our heart, our soul, and our might.
[time=1329] You say, how does that tie in with evangelism?
[time=1331] How does that tie in with our praying for the lost in 1 Timothy chapter 2?
[time=1335] It's very simple.
[time=1336] Before a man can come to the knowledge of the truth, before a man can be saved, he has to first acknowledge God as the only uncreated being, and then by the same token,
[time=1346] acknowledge himself as being created, as being derived, as being a contingent self.
[time=1353] He is not autonomous as men so often think themselves.
[time=1356] He is not totally self-directing.
[time=1358] He cannot sustain himself.
[time=1360] In fact, the very breath that he just breathed was a gift from God.
[time=1365] The reason his heart still beats, the reason the particles of his body hold together is because that one self-existent God allows it to be so and works for it as such.
[time=1376] It is absolutely a humbling reality.
[time=1378] It shatters man's sense of pride and sense of independence and sense of "I am."
[time=1386] It is he who himself possesses nothing.
[time=1390] It forces us to recognize that and declare our dependence each and every moment of our existence upon the one who has created him.
[time=1398] When God says, "I am," he makes an unqualified declaration of independent selfhood.
[time=1405] I am the only one who is independent, and when man fails to epicnosis that reality,
[time=1411] in effect, he says, "No, you're not.
[time=1415] I am. You may be, but I am." When man fails to acknowledge the independent self-sufficiency of the Almighty Yahweh,
[time=1425] he lifts up a fist in the face of God and asserts his own autonomy.
[time=1431] In effect, he says, "I'm not your creation. I'm not dependent upon you." In fact, I am able to sit in judgment of you. I am able to evaluate you and decide whether or not I will acknowledge you in my life.
[time=1445] And it's an adulterated pride, the root of all sin.
[time=1450] A.W. Tozer put it this way, to describe the scenario a little more clearly.
[time=1455] It is as if we, as moral beings, created to worship before the throne of God,
[time=1461] sit on the throne of our own selfhood, and from that elevated position declares, "I am," and that is sin in its concentrated essence.
[time=1472] Yet because it is so natural to us, it appears to be good.
[time=1476] It appears to be healthy.
[time=1478] It is only when the soul is brought before the face of the most holy one without the protective shield of his own ignorance that the frightening moral incongruity is brought home to his conscience.
[time=1490] I have usurped the throne of my life.
[time=1495] I have pretended myself to be independent, self-directing, self-sustaining.
[time=1501] And in that way, I have offended the most holy God who alone is that.
[time=1510] And the cry is, "What shall we do?" Remember where they said that?
[time=1514] "What shall we do?" When the center comes to this acknowledgement, he cries out, "What shall we do?" Even as they did in Acts chapter 4, when Peter was preaching and the Spirit convicted their heart of their sin, and they cried out, "What shall we do?" and Peter said, "Repent.
[time=1528] Repent.
[time=1529] Change your mind.
[time=1530] Come to acknowledge the truth."
[time=1536] And he goes on in this passage in Deuteronomy 6.
[time=1538] Not only is the fact that God is the only "I am," and therefore we are to love him, adore him, and worship him with all of our heart, our soul, and our might.
[time=1547] But he goes on and says in verse 7, "This is the fundamental truth that you should pass from generation to generation.
[time=1552] Teach it diligently to your sons.
[time=1554] Talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.
[time=1559] This is the fundamental truth of all reality, that there is but one I am,
[time=1565] and the reflective truth, therefore I am not anything but dependent and the creature."
[time=1572] And in verse 8, "So important is this truth that you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontals on your forehead, and you shall write them on the doorpost of your house and on your gates." You ever been in somebody's house who is a fanatic fitness person?
[time=1586] What do you see?
[time=1587] You see a lot of fitness stuff, and then you see posters of people who have reached the epitome of fitness.
[time=1592] They write it on their doorposts.
[time=1594] They write it on their house.
[time=1595] They put it on their walls.
[time=1596] They absolutely immerse themselves in this kind of thing, and that's what he's calling for here.
[time=1601] The fact that there is only one I am should permeate every aspect of your existence.
[time=1606] Because it will protect you.
[time=1609] Protect you from what?
[time=1611] Look at verse 10.
[time=1612] "Then it shall come about when the Lord your God brings you into the land which He swore to your fathers, Abram, Isaac, and Jacob, to give you great and splendid cities which you did not build, and houses full of good things which you did not fill, and hewn cisterns which you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you shall eat and be satisfied, then watch yourself lest you what?
[time=1632] Lest you forget the Lord, lest you forget Yahweh, the only I am who brought you from the land of Egypt out of the house of slavery." He knows how prone we are to again try to declare our independence.
[time=1643] And as soon as he gives us wealth, and as soon as he gives us stability, and as soon as he gives us an income and houses and riches, we then want to say, "See, I am independent.
[time=1653] I can do this on my own.
[time=1655] It isn't that I am for the very next breath, and I am totally and completely dependent on the only uncreated being.
[time=1661] I am okay by myself, and that is the fear.
[time=1665] That is what is to be guarded against.
[time=1667] That is why it is to be passed on from generation to generation, and tied on the hand, and tied on the funnel of the forehead, and placed on the door posts and on the gates.
[time=1678] Verse 13, "You shall fear only the Lord your God, and you shall worship Him, and swear by His name you shall not follow the other gods.
[time=1687] Any of the gods of the peoples who surround you, the pantheon of the Canaanites, who had developed an entire barrage of gods,
[time=1698] who were not the true and only God.
[time=1701] El, and Baal, and Astoroth, and Baal'sable, the Lord of the Flies, and Gad, and Gagan, and the list could go on, and on, and on, and on.
[time=1709] They were surrounded by a people who defied the reality of only one God, and instead made from the imaginations of their own heart many gods who would somehow make their world what they wanted it, or the pantheon of gods that filled Babylon as they went into exile there, Vell the sun god, or sicketh the god of the stars.
[time=1732] And we think about the United States of America, and we realize that here in America, you can say a couple of things.
[time=1743] You know what you can say about God in the summer, in this place?
[time=1746] You can say there are many gods, and be accepted by this world.
[time=1750] It's Vogue, there are many gods, new age movement, you can get to heaven this way, you can have this God, there's many gods.
[time=1757] That's very acceptable, you can stand in any secular forum and proclaim with as loud a voice as you'd like there are many gods, and everybody will kind of shake your hand for being so broad-minded, being so enlightened, for being so intelligent.
[time=1766] You know what else you can say in public around here?
[time=1768] You can say there's no God.
[time=1770] They'll accept you for that.
[time=1772] Say there's no God, I'm believing God.
[time=1774] You're a very scientific person, you're very bright, I like you.
[time=1777] You know what they'll run you out of town on a rail for saying?
[time=1781] There's one God.
[time=1783] Try saying one God, not many gods, your gods are wrong, there's one God, and you're wrong, there is a God, there's one God.
[time=1790] What do people do?
[time=1792] They get angry, they call you narrow, they call you bigoted, they call you judgmental, they call you legalistic, and they eventually explode in the fit of rage because they don't want to accept that one simple reality, because if it's true, they're accountable to Him.
[time=1812] That is the starting point of salvation, to admit that there is only one God and not just an absolute being, not some undefined thing out there in the universe, but the God of this Bible, the God of the old and the New Testament, the God who made the heavens and the earth in creation, displaying His awesome power and wisdom, speaking the whole thing into existence out of nothing.
[time=1835] The same very God who, in Genesis chapter 6, wiped every human off the face of the earth because He found them sinful and repulsive as a God of judgment and wrath.
[time=1845] The same God who then worked salvation through Abraham, promising a covenant to reach all the nations of the world.
[time=1852] The same God who drew the people out of Exodus, out of His compassionate heart, as He heard the nation of Israel under their laborious slavery, the same God who protected Joshua and gave Him success for His obedience to this very Word of God.
[time=1866] That is the God that is, and there is no other.
[time=1871] And that is the beginning of salvation.
[time=1874] When you and I pray, if you'll go back now to 1 Timothy chapter 2, when you and I pray for the salvation of the souls of men, it is that they would come to acknowledge the reality that there is only one God, and that that God is this God.
[time=1895] And you know what happens when they come to that conclusion?
[time=1900] You know what happens, and by the way, not just that conclusion.
[time=1903] You know what happens when they epignose that, when they really receive that, when that comes fully into their heart and mind as it's being commanded to have be done here in this text, they immediately cry out for a mediator.
[time=1916] They immediately cry out for a mediator.
[time=1919] If in fact there is only one God, and if in fact my life to this date has been usurping His glory, and His wonder, and His awe, and His splendor, and I have been pretending to be my own God, whether I express that through false gods or just in my own atheism, then I know at that moment that I am in desperate trouble.
[time=1940] And there has to be a mediator for me.
[time=1944] And that's the next truth.
[time=1946] Verse 5, "For there is one God, and then what?
[time=1949] And one mediator also between God and men." John 14, 6, Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man, not one of them, comes unto the Father but by me."
[time=1964] Only one God.
[time=1967] Acts chapter 4, "And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved." Angels cannot mediate, saints cannot mediate, the Virgin Mary cannot mediate, the church cannot mediate, Buddha, Muhammad, Allah.
[time=1991] None of them, there is but one, there is only one.
[time=1995] The word mediator means go between.
[time=1998] It means one who will stand in the gap.
[time=2002] And that is desperately the need of men who have not already received Christ.
[time=2008] For Romans chapter 5 describes the unsaved man with four very graphic terms.
[time=2012] First, they are described as helpless.
[time=2015] Helpless, absolutely incapable of changing their situation with God.
[time=2020] Secondly, they are described as ungodly, meaning they are absolutely filled with sin.
[time=2025] And then described as sinners as characteristic of the pattern of their life, and then they are called his enemies.
[time=2031] And sometimes people get the notion, "I am not really at war with God.
[time=2034] I mean, I don't hate Christians, if they want to believe that stuff, that's fine.
[time=2037] There is room in my life for Christians.
[time=2039] I am not narrow. I am not an end.
[time=2041] I have never persecuted the church.
[time=2043] I am not at enmity with God.
[time=2045] Oh, yes you are. For every second that you deny acknowledging the reality
[time=2051] that he is the only I am, you are at enmity with him." And back in that text in Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 14, I think, or 15, it says that he is a jealous God and he will destroy white people off the face of the earth,
[time=2066] those who do not acknowledge that he is the only I am.
[time=2069] People are at enmity with God.
[time=2072] They need a mediator.
[time=2074] It's like a marriage situation that so terribly degenerates that the people can't even be in the same room together.
[time=2079] There is so much hatred. There is so much pain.
[time=2081] There is so much sorrow.
[time=2082] And a mediator is needed to talk between the two in hopes of trying to get the thing back together.
[time=2087] That's the idea of a mediator.
[time=2089] That's what Jesus does.
[time=2091] Jesus moves between God and man trying to reconcile the situation.
[time=2097] God has been so offended.
[time=2101] He's too hot. He's too angry. It's too volatile.
[time=2105] We have been too sinful in not acknowledging him as the only I am.
[time=2111] Where are we to go into his presence?
[time=2113] We would be immediately incinerated.
[time=2115] So there is a mediator, and you say, "Well, what about the mediator?" Look at it. He's described as having three qualities.
[time=2122] This mediator, Jesus Christ.
[time=2125] Verse 5, "One mediator, also between God and men, the man Christ Jesus." He became a man.
[time=2132] Secondly, he gave himself as a ransom.
[time=2135] And thirdly, he is then a testimony born at the proper time.
[time=2138] What does it mean? He became a man.
[time=2140] You see it there in your text probably as the man Christ Jesus.
[time=2144] But there is no article there. There is no definite article in the Greek.
[time=2147] It just says man, entropos.
[time=2149] And it emphasizes the nature of becoming a human or the human nature.
[time=2153] What it's saying is that the second person of the Trinity, total God,
[time=2159] took on the form of human flesh and became man so that he could then be perfectly suited to mediate between the two. He can mediate before God because he is God.
[time=2168] And he can mediate for man because by taking the form of human flesh as he was joined
[time=2174] to a sinless human nature in the womb of the Virgin Mary, he can also act on our behalf.
[time=2179] He is the perfect mediator, and it took him becoming human flesh, which should not be underestimated.
[time=2186] The sacrificial element involved there, tied to that flesh forever now.
[time=2192] It says also that he gave himself a ransom.
[time=2195] The word is lutron in the Greek, and it describes a ransom that is paid to release someone from captivity or slavery.
[time=2203] The picture might be if one of our children had been kidnapped and they had demanded some type of ransom and we would put together a sum of money.
[time=2211] That sum is called the lutron. Christ is the lutron. Christ is the ransom.
[time=2215] He is in fact what was given so that we could be freed from the power of sin.
[time=2219] And 1 Peter 1, 18, and 19 says it wasn't just Christ, it was the blood of Christ that we were redeemed.
[time=2226] Precious blood as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ, not gold, not silver.
[time=2233] But here the vicarious death of Jesus Christ, his very life as exemplified in the shedding of his blood becomes our lutron.
[time=2242] Another thing you can't see here, I wish you could in the English, verse 6.
[time=2246] He who gave himself as a ransom, the word is a compound with a preposition.
[time=2250] It's anti-lutron, not just ransom, but an exchange ransom or a substitute ransom.
[time=2259] In other words, it was supposed to be our blood, but his blood instead, because he exchanged the ransom.
[time=2267] I want to show you this in one passage, let me just read it to you if you don't want to turn there.
[time=2272] Isaiah 53 brings Yahweh in action to provide this sacrificial ransom.
[time=2280] It says in Isaiah 53, verse 6, "All of us, like sheep, have gone astray.
[time=2286] Each of us has turned to his own way." That's our self-independence. That's our pride.
[time=2291] That's our foolish ignorance to acknowledge that God is the only I am and therefore we should immediately love him with all of our heart or soul in our mind.
[time=2299] That we are a sheep going astray and turning to our own way, but it says.
[time=2303] But the Lord, Yahweh, the Yahweh, the only I am has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2314] Verse 10, the same term for God is used in Yahweh, but the Yahweh was pleased to crush him, putting him to grief if he would render himself as a guilt offering.
[time=2326] It's an unbelievable concept that God would crush his own for us.
[time=2334] You know you struggle with that to try to communicate that even to your children and I often worry that I will, as earthly fathers as flawed, terribly flawed as we are, we are still what is helping shape their impression of God in heaven.
[time=2349] We walk tenderly sometimes with that responsibility wondering how and how do I show them all of God ultimately?
[time=2357] I know I can't, but as much as I could.
[time=2359] And I think of, I'm sure I show them the wrath of God, you know, and I know I show them the impatience of God because I get impatient and I don't think that's the way that I should show it.
[time=2369] But I know they see that in me and I think they see the love of God in me.
[time=2373] I think they sense that I deeply love them and would give my life for them.
[time=2377] But how do I show them that?
[time=2379] This idea of, well, I had one of my daughters do something wrong the other day and I'm not going to give their name because whenever I give their name I have to give them a dollar.
[time=2386] You understand it's a deal in my family?
[time=2388] So there's a freebie for us today, no name, no dollar.
[time=2393] And I did something wrong there and so we're working through that up to the room, you know, for the spanking.
[time=2400] And I do believe in spanking.
[time=2402] I believe the Bible teaches you supposed to spank and so I spank.
[time=2405] I have a little thing, a little spanker, I call it a wacker.
[time=2410] It's a leather strip about two inches wide and about six inches long and it's got good flex in it, you know what I mean?
[time=2417] You don't have to take your belt off and it gives it a real good sting but it doesn't bruise.
[time=2421] So I can inflict the necessary amount of pain without bruising.
[time=2425] It's my wacker.
[time=2426] Carry it wherever I go.
[time=2428] Now I have my wacker and I had my daughter and we had talked through it and it was now time for the wrath to come.
[time=2437] So, you know, up there on the bed and take down the pants and I got a quick wrist, you know, that works good.
[time=2443] And I got that going thinking here we go.
[time=2445] But this time I put my hand on the bottom and then I go whack, whack, whack on the hand, not the bottom, my hand.
[time=2458] And you see this breath start to be taken to scream, right?
[time=2462] Now they're supposed to be excruciating pain because it sounded like there was pain back there but there just is no pain.
[time=2470] And this look comes back around like what happened back there?
[time=2478] And then you show your hand and there it is.
[time=2484] Right there, antilutron. I took your beating. I took your spanking. That's the mediator we have.
[time=2492] We have a mediator who sees how violated the only I am is when we fail to acknowledge that.
[time=2499] In order to be the go-between as he should, he doesn't just negotiate for two parties in some type of a distant way and look for a check at the end.
[time=2506] He becomes human flesh and is now tied to that forever and ever and ever and then he becomes the ransom he has crushed on our behalf.
[time=2514] He takes the blows that were delivered that should have been given to us.
[time=2517] And then thirdly he becomes the testimony born at the proper time.
[time=2521] The testimony born at the proper time.
[time=2523] You see by becoming flesh and by dying on the cross in fact even by being born and living his life and all the miracles and then the trials and then the crucifixion and then the burial and then the resurrection.
[time=2534] Those become indisputable historical facts.
[time=2538] They are as true as the fact that Columbus discovered America.
[time=2542] Any historical fact you can think of.
[time=2545] The death and resurrection of Jesus Christ has equal proof in the category of the historicity of the event.
[time=2552] He is now a living testimony and by crashing into space and time by becoming human flesh and dying he is and does become an indisputable testimony to the truth that there is one God and one mediator.
[time=2563] He did the whole thing.
[time=2568] So there is one God and when that is held in the breast of a human being the cry comes for some form of help and it comes to them in the form of one mediator who became man who was the ransom himself, the shedding of his blood and gave testimony for the rest of time.
[time=2588] Paul goes on in verse 7 and says you see this is why I was appointed a preacher.
[time=2593] This is why I was appointed an apostle as a teacher and notice to the Gentiles and here we feel the same all men, the all men of verse 1 pray for all men, the all men of verse 4.
[time=2605] God desires all men and he moves out of this exclusive myopic understanding that the Jews had of their own faith and it was just for the Jews and he says I am living proof that God desires the salvation of all men because he has sent me
[time=2617] to herald this truth to everybody, Jew and Gentile.
[time=2622] And so he adds that in the arsenal of support that God really desires the salvation of all men.
[time=2628] The word herald is an interesting word it simply is one who would stand and proclaim at like an athletic event a religious festival national function and his job was to have a strong and powerful voice and be able to herald the message that was to be announced
[time=2645] and in particular at the athletic events he was international in that sense, he would announce everybody from everywhere.
[time=2650] He would give the name and the country of every competitor and when the competitor won it was his job again to give that person's name and country and father.
[time=2658] He was not a bigoted person, he would yell the truth to all who would listen, all the nationalities being represented there.
[time=2667] He says I Paul says I am like that herald, I yell out to all men that there is one God, one mediator.
[time=2680] And so now as we come to the close of this passage we come to verse eight, it comes back by saying therefore I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without wrath and without dissension.
[time=2694] Therefore obviously means based on everything I've just said, this all sums up to this.
[time=2699] First I want you to do this and he uses the strongest word for will here.
[time=2704] This is Bula Mai, this is the Bula Mai of the Apostle Paul, this is the decree of Paul, this is the declarative will of Paul.
[time=2710] He marshals his apostolic authority which he's just referenced in verse seven and he says as an apostle I declare to you I want you regularly praying for the lost, this isn't my longing, this isn't my desire, this is my command.
[time=2723] I want you to pray.
[time=2725] And then these three descriptive phrases of how to pray, by lifting up one holy hands, two without wrath and three dissension.
[time=2734] And there are some who have been misled by this verse to assume that whenever you pray for anything or specifically whenever you pray for the souls of the lost you're supposed to put your hands up in the air.
[time=2745] This is the way to pray, see it says it right there, therefore I want them in in every place to pray how, well lift your hands up in the air, lift your holy hands up in the air and pray.
[time=2752] And they think that the verse describes a posture of prayer.
[time=2756] Well that isn't right, that isn't true, scripture never prescribes in the one particular correct posture for prayer.
[time=2763] Abraham prayed while standing before the Lord, Genesis 18.
[time=2768] Moses spoke of spreading out his hands and praying for the thunder to cease in connection with one of the great plagues.
[time=2775] The Levites sang praises with joy and bowed down when they prayed and 2 Chronicles 29.
[time=2781] Jesus in praying for Lazarus raised his eyes to heaven and prayed, eyes open, father I thank thee that thou hast hurtest me were his words.
[time=2790] Daniel is the prayer warrior on his knees, old camel knees Daniel who is always on his knees praying in that particular posture.
[time=2798] The people under Ezra's leadership bowed down to the ground and worshiped the Lord with their face to the ground.
[time=2806] And then of course there was the tax gatherer in Luke 18 who prayed while beating on his breast.
[time=2812] There's just a tremendous display of posture for prayer in the entire Bible.
[time=2818] And there are all kinds of different combinations of those postures as you continue to study the word and posture with prayer.
[time=2825] You know what's interesting the only posture you don't read about in the Bible is our posture.
[time=2830] Nowhere does it tell us to close our eyes and fold our hands when we pray.
[time=2835] That's our little deal and it's not wrong, it's just a posture.
[time=2839] See I think that the great variety of posture described for prayer in the Bible stresses that there is no one posture.
[time=2846] In fact it doesn't matter what posture you have, what really matters is your what?
[time=2850] Your heart, what really matters is your heart when you pray.
[time=2855] Psalm 66 if I regard iniquity in my heart the Lord will not hear me.
[time=2860] That's what stressed.
[time=2862] James 5 says the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
[time=2866] Why? Because he's a righteous man he prays in accord with the will of God.
[time=2871] The holy hands here is just a reference to a lifestyle, a lifestyle that is often lived out by our hands.
[time=2879] Listen to Isaiah 1 verse 15 with respect to the hands.
[time=2884] So he says when you spread out your hands in prayer I will hide my eyes from you.
[time=2889] Yes even though you multiply your prayers I'll hide and I'll not listen.
[time=2893] Why? Your hands are covered with blood.
[time=2897] Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, remove the evil of your deeds from my sight, cease to do evil, learn to do good.
[time=2905] In other words this thing, these things our hands are what do our deeds and they symbolically become bloody if we are murderous.
[time=2913] They are unholy if we are unholy.
[time=2916] This is not a prescription for how to pray for the lost but with respect to posture.
[time=2921] In fact this is the only place in the New Testament that it tells us to do that.
[time=2924] The gesture mentioned is incidental to the qualifying adjective holy.
[time=2929] Holy is what's important, be holy.
[time=2931] The holy word here means to be unpoluted.
[time=2934] Let your life be unpoluted by sin.
[time=2936] Therefore your hands are unpoluted by sinful deeds and then lift those if you so choose in prayer.
[time=2943] An unpoluted life, holy hands.
[time=2946] And that is further backed up by these other two descriptive phrases without wrath and dissension.
[time=2950] That has nothing to do with posture.
[time=2952] Wrath describes the anger that we hold in our hearts and over and over again.
[time=2957] God says he is not interested in hearing our prayers or receiving our worship.
[time=2962] Excuse me, so long as we have wrath in our heart.
[time=2965] Matthew 5, if therefore you are presenting your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your offering before the altar.
[time=2973] Go your way.
[time=2974] First be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering.
[time=2978] At the end of the Lord's Prayer he says if you do not forgive men then your father will not forgive your transgressions.
[time=2984] And that is the Lord's Prayer, that is what they are asking for.
[time=2988] Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[time=2993] Give us our daily bread and forgive us.
[time=2995] Forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors.
[time=2999] And then it says but if you do not forgive men your father is not going to, you are not going to hear your prayers.
[time=3004] If your heart is full of wrath, if your heart is full of anger, God does not hear your prayers.
[time=3011] And the word is further strengthened with this idea of dissension which means quarrels and an argumentative spirit.
[time=3018] An inner attitude is here stressed that is absence and devoid of wrath and dissension.
[time=3023] And so what he describes in our prayer life is that the men, and this is a public prayer here in view, the men who would lead us in praying for the lost need to be men who have holy hands which are reflective of a holy lifestyle and a holy heart and a holy disposition.
[time=3037] And they are to be free from wrath and anger and dissension and not be quarrelsome people.
[time=3044] I want to back up for just a minute and talk about the flow of this passage.
[time=3054] This is amazing, the flow as it comes in this book.
[time=3058] Come with me to 1 Timothy 3 for a minute.
[time=3061] I want you to see the unbelievable emphasis that Paul puts on the truth.
[time=3067] How important it is that we have the truth.
[time=3070] Look at 315.
[time=3072] He says, "I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God and then what does he call the church, the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=3083] The church is the bastion of truth.
[time=3086] It is given to us in the Word of God and it is our responsibility to guard what has been entrusted to us, even as Paul says to Timothy.
[time=3095] We must defend the truth.
[time=3097] We must be unequivocally in our commitment to the truth.
[time=3100] Go back to chapter 1 and realize that the entire chapter, the entire chapter 1 is committed to confronting men who are lying about the truth.
[time=3111] He describes their errant doctrine, remember in verse 3, their strange doctrine, and he says they pay attention to these myths and these endless genealogies.
[time=3120] And then he goes on and says it's fruitless discussion in verse 6.
[time=3124] I mean, this is harsh, this is dogmatic, this is stringent, this is confrontive because the truth is at stake here.
[time=3133] He then goes on to name these men even, which is very confront.
[time=3137] Look at verse 20, among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander who I have delivered over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
[time=3144] He names them and then he turns them over to the power of the wicked one for the destruction of their flesh.
[time=3150] Paul is absolutely, totally enamored and committed and he's a die-hard for the truth of Scripture.
[time=3158] You remember, we won't go there, but back in Acts when he was there for those three and a half years.
[time=3163] And remember Ephesus, this city, this is where he gave the most truth to anyone church.
[time=3167] He stayed here the longest, he taught the most.
[time=3170] And on his departure he said there are going to come savage wolves and they will come and destroy what we have done.
[time=3176] They will mitigate and malign the truth of God.
[time=3179] And so over and over and over and over again, and Paul's message to this church, he says you must have the truth.
[time=3186] But what I like about chapter two is that he says having the truth isn't enough.
[time=3194] Having the truth is not enough.
[time=3197] Until you have the truth about Christ and about God so deeply bound up in your heart that you come to the place that you pray for the salvation of all men, you don't have enough.
[time=3212] And this is what keeps us from being the divisive, hyper-fundamental, antagonistic people who are really just standing against everything,
[time=3223] standing against, standing against, standing against because they think they're standing for the truth.
[time=3228] And they become as a church and as a body very, very narrow and they have no outreach and there is no magnanimous spirit in their hearts because they only do one thing, they only stand against error.
[time=3240] And what Paul says to this church at Ephesus as this book unfolds is the truth is critical.
[time=3246] You can't live without it but unless you hold the truth tightly in your heart as it applies to the lost souls you haven't got enough.
[time=3255] Come with me now to Revelation chapter two.
[time=3259] Christ here evaluates the church at Ephesus.
[time=3262] This is some thirty years later.
[time=3266] Listen to what happened to them.
[time=3272] Revelation chapter two.
[time=3274] To the angel of the church in Ephesus right the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand.
[time=3279] The one who walks among the seven golden lampstands says this, this about you verse two.
[time=3285] I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance that you cannot what?
[time=3291] You cannot endure evil men and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles and they are not and you found them to be false.
[time=3299] He's congratulating them.
[time=3300] They did what he said they hung on to the truth of God.
[time=3304] Verse three and you have perseverance and you have endured for my name's sake and have not grown weary.
[time=3310] He congratulates them but then verse four.
[time=3312] But I have this against you.
[time=3315] You have left your first love.
[time=3320] You have lost the passion behind it for lost souls.
[time=3323] Remember therefore from where you have fallen and repent and do the deeds at first.
[time=3327] What you did at first or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand of its place unless you repent.
[time=3334] Verse six this you do have that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans and which I also hate.
[time=3341] He says in other words you degenerate it into cold orthodoxy, you have got the truth but there is no passion in your truth.
[time=3350] There is no passion for the lost.
[time=3355] And so we are reminded that the mission of the church is to stand unequivocally for the truth but never let that degenerate into cold orthodoxy.
[time=3364] Where all we are doing is standing against air and standing against that and we become very introspective and very self-contained instead of being huge and magnanimous with a tranquil and quiet lifestyle and godliness and dignity understanding that our mission is to reach the lost.
[time=3381] The truth is of its greatest value when it is brought to bear in the hearts and souls of lost men is what he is saying.
[time=3387] Don't lose your first love.
[time=3390] Don't let go.
[time=3393] We have been sharing with you music from Rejoice and our hand bell choir and the message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
