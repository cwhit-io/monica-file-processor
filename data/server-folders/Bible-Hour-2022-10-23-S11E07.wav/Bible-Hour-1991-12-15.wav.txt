[time=0] In the last several years we've seen an increasing number of female pastors, women
[time=7] preachers, women ministers. Is that a healthy progressive development of the church or a departure from biblical truth? Stay with us this morning. We're going to look at one of the most comprehensive passages in all of the New Testament on the women's role in the church.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we
[time=41] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today Pastor Moore will be looking at the role of women in the church with the message he is entitled to God's High Calling. We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study with us. Our special music today will be provided by our children's choirs. They will be singing a medley of Christmas songs. As we prepare
[time=64] for our time of Bible study let's listen to the Living Christmas Tree choirs they sing a medley entitled "Celebration of Joy."
[time=98] [MUSIC - 173 seconds]
[time=285] [APPLAUSE]
[time=293] Let's go to the manger again as we sing a little bit, a little town of Bethela Ham 141, please. 141. We'll sing verses 1, 2. Well let's sing them all this morning as a matter of fact.
[time=307] That's a great story and we'll sing all four verses together.
[time=312] [MUSIC - 152 seconds]
[time=469] Thank you for tuning into the Bible Hour today. I hope that you enjoyed the message in song from our Living Christmas Tree Choir and we are very heavily into the concerts. We had the opportunity of saying hello to many of you that have already joined us for our concerts and I hope you enjoyed them. When we speak about traditions and cherished memories I guess when it comes to the Colby family we have to include the Living Christmas Tree because everybody's involved at this time and I'm happy to present my family on the Bible Hour today. I want to talk first with Carol. Carol we've had a busy time working on the tree and you've had a lot of responsibilities.
[time=504] This has been a fun year again for me. I'm in charge of doing the decorations on the tree and the decorations in the church and this year we centered our theme around angels. It's also been fun for us because we've had the children all involved in the tree
[time=519] this year. If you're involved in our family you have to get involved in the tree and
[time=525] I want to introduce my entire family to you. I have Peter and Andy and Lisa and Scott with us.
[time=531] Peter tell us a little bit about what's happened in your life in the last year.
[time=535] Well I just graduated from Liberty University with a marketing degree and in January we'll be starting a new job. And Andy tell us what's happening in your life.
[time=544] Well I'm a junior at Blackout Christian School and I'm involved in soccer and drama.
[time=549] And Lisa and Scott this is a very exciting time for them because Scott is in his final
[time=556] days of seminary of Scott. Where have you been studying in recent days?
[time=561] Well I'm finishing my coursework at Grace Theological Seminary for my master of
[time=567] divinity degree and Lisa and I are just anxiously awaiting ministry opportunities down the road. We're looking forward to the fact that Scott and Lisa will be involved in preaching the Word of God in one of the churches perhaps in our area or wherever the Lord will lead them. Lisa you've been a good support to Scott and pretty involved in your work in the church activities.
[time=589] Yes we're just really excited to see what the Lord has for us in the next couple of days and I've been working full time while Scott's been going to school and just involved here in the activities at church with the children's choir and the living Christmas tree and we'll just see what the Lord has for us.
[time=603] Really pleased that my family is not only involved in the living Christmas tree
[time=609] but anxious to serve the Lord in many ways and it really is very rewarding and we're grateful for that.
[time=615] If you're free on Christmas Eve we have a program here at Blackhawk Baptist Church on the 24th of December on Tuesday evening. It's a time of singing and communion.
[time=625] I hope that you can join with us at 6 p.m. that's December 24th.

[time=1331] All those words that they just go over and over and over and memorize and having their hearts and the melody that goes with it.
[time=1337] We're so excited that our kids are part of all that.
[time=1340] Well, this morning, if you'd take your Bibles, let's open the first Timothy chapter 2 and begin in verses 9 and we'll read all the way to verse 15.
[time=1350] We start a brand new subject this morning.
[time=1353] We've moved from the subject of evangelistic praying and the public assembly to the subject of women
[time=1360] in the public assembly.
[time=1364] And we may have gotten here a little too fast.
[time=1368] This is one of the hottest and most controversial subjects in Christianity today.
[time=1375] The words, as you will see, for some are emotionally charged.
[time=1379] They are volatile to some people's way of thinking and flamatory words and many bristle at even the cursory reading of a passage such as this.
[time=1389] But follow along and I will read.
[time=1393] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments,
[time=1406] but rather by means of good works as befits women making a claim to godliness.
[time=1412] Let a woman quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.
[time=1417] But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.
[time=1423] For it was Adam who was first created and then Eve.
[time=1427] And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being quite deceived fell into transgression.
[time=1433] But women shall be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
[time=1441] Well, as I have said, this is a highly controversial passage.
[time=1446] It feels a little bit like walking into a room full of dynamite with a match that's lit.
[time=1452] And I'll be asking your prayers, this very service and those to come will probably be several Sundays in this passage this Sunday
[time=1460] and then we'll not preach on it on Christmas Sunday or the one directly preceding Christmas and then we'll be back into it.
[time=1465] And I'll be looking for you to be praying for the pastor and the preacher that he doesn't in some way give a thought off the cuff that in any way is degrading
[time=1474] or is the meaning of the incredible thing that God has given us by way of women.
[time=1480] And that would be a major concern of my heart.
[time=1482] I want to uplift you women in this passage.
[time=1485] I want to show you God's high calling for you in the church.
[time=1489] I want it to be a time of encouragement and strength, but I am very aware of how sensitive, a subject it is, especially in our day and age.
[time=1498] The dialogue and debate and even the conflict that goes on over the role of women in the church has reached massive proportions.
[time=1506] Countless sermons, books, magazine articles and denominational debates rage over the issue of the women's role in the church.
[time=1515] The list of questions is long.
[time=1518] They range in this order.
[time=1520] What is a woman's rightful place among Christians when they assemble for worship and instruction?
[time=1526] Is it necessary that she remained totally in the background?
[time=1530] Should she be allowed to teach in any capacity?
[time=1534] If she serves in any place of leadership, has she thereby violated the commands in this passage?
[time=1541] What does it mean that a woman is to remain quiet as it says in this text?
[time=1546] Does it mean that she shouldn't pray, shouldn't sing?
[time=1550] And these are among the more mild of the questions that rage around this debate.
[time=1555] And the whole thing really heats up when we start talking about women being ordained in the ministry, becoming pastors and teachers and leaders in an official position.
[time=1564] Women becoming elders in a church and that is where the whole thing really intensifies because it strikes at the heart of what has been the traditional position of the fundamental church.
[time=1577] The passage in front of us is of all those in the scriptures the most profound, the most comprehensive and our Lord through the Apostle Paul with an amazing economy of words brings together a massive amount of truth on this subject.
[time=1591] And as I have said, we will spend several weeks studying it, but by way of an outline I would offer to you five main points in these verses.
[time=1600] There are appearance of women, the attitude of women, the role of women, the design of women and the contribution of women in the church.
[time=1613] The passage begins with this word likewise, you see it there at the beginning of verse nine, likewise I want women to adorn themselves and that tells us that the subject matter we've just been discussing in the previous eight verses is carrying on now.
[time=1627] The idea here is found in chapter three verse fifteen, this is what Paul is doing, he is writing to the church at large so that people should know how to conduct himself in the household of God.
[time=1639] This is specific instruction given to the church at Ephesus about when they meet, about when they assemble like we are this morning.
[time=1648] He had just said when you meet first of all verse one the very most important thing I want you to be doing is praying for the lost.
[time=1655] Every time you meet it should be a regular habitual pattern that as the assembled saints together you pray for the lost.
[time=1662] And as we've talked about that that's because it calls us back to the great commission, it calls us back to who we are supposed to be as a church, it reminds us of our mission and allows all of this other information about ordering the church to find its proper place under that one main goal and thrust.
[time=1677] But he says likewise when he comes to verse nine saying okay now we're still in the worship center, we're still in the assembling of the saints.
[time=1685] So this is all about women adorning themselves to come to church.
[time=1692] Let's look at the first main point, the attire, how are they to look when they come to church?
[time=1699] He says likewise in verse nine I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing.
[time=1705] Now the word adorn there I want women to adorn is the word cause me in the Greek and it's familiar to us because it's the word we get our word cosmetic from, to dress up, to put on makeup, to make yourself presentable.
[time=1720] The word basically means to arrange or to put an order or to make ready and I like it because he says I want women to do that, I want women to do that, I want women to order themselves and to properly prepare themselves as they come to church.
[time=1734] If anybody would know that women like to do that I would know that.
[time=1738] I live in a house with five women, a wife and four daughters.
[time=1742] And it is amazing how much they like to get dressed up, I just believe it's part of the way that God has made them.
[time=1749] I think of myself as being the caretaker of the best sorority this side of the Mississippi, you know, I mean this is my lot in life.
[time=1757] And just last night, coincidentally, I mean little Whitney, my youngest, there goes a buck by the way, my little, my youngest.
[time=1768] She doesn't know what I'm preaching on but I'm down there sitting at the table and I'm working on my computer and Heidi's running an errand and the other girls are somewhere else but little Whitney at two years old is upstairs in the dress up closet and she's putting all this stuff on stuff I'd never seen her in before.
[time=1783] And she comes down the stairs and into the living room and through into the dining room where I'm sitting and she just stands there.
[time=1789] As if to say look, I'm adorned, I'm all dressed up.
[time=1793] You know, that's what they do, that's what girls like to do and that's good, that's what I want women to adorn themselves.
[time=1800] Paul puts his stamp of approval on what is so innate and intrinsic in women.
[time=1805] You know, it's really been this way all my life, I am the only boy in a family of four children, I have three older sisters.
[time=1812] So this is just nothing new for me.
[time=1816] I can remember from my earliest days getting up in the morning I wonder what everybody was arguing about.
[time=1822] And you go into the bathroom and there's only so much mirror space and there were my three sisters, you know, elbowing each other trying to become presentable.
[time=1829] I'll never forget it, I was about six or seven years old, they decided they would adorn little Russell.
[time=1836] Yes they did and they put a dress on me and they put high heels on me and they put eye makeup on and then they put a wig on and jewelry and then they headed for the front door.
[time=1850] And they were going to parade me down the street to all their friends when thankfully my father rescued me from this torture.
[time=1857] And my greatest joy in life is that nobody took a picture.
[time=1862] That could be bribe money.
[time=1865] This is how women are, this is how women are supposed to be, this is good, this is natural, this is right.
[time=1871] And we as men are called to respect that in our wives and in our daughters.
[time=1876] There is a place for them to adorn themselves.
[time=1879] But Paul says there is a way for that to happen.
[time=1882] It is to be orderly, it is to be proper, proper clothing.
[time=1886] Another, just another derivative of this word cosmetic, the word proper meaning that it's supposed to have a certain order and it's to be becoming and it is to be well ordered and well arranged.
[time=1896] The idea being that it is not proper for a woman to come to the worship service in a chaotic fashion in a disorderly way, in disarray and without proper preparation, in unbecoming demeanor, unbecoming wardrobe.
[time=1911] Now as we all know, our clothing, male and female, is more than just what we put on.
[time=1917] It is a reflection of what is in our minds, it is a reflection of how we view ourselves and how we want other people to view us.
[time=1925] That is why this word that he uses, the word clothing, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing is really a much broader term than just clothing.
[time=1935] It does include clothing, but it is describing the demeanor of a person, the attitude of the person.
[time=1943] And so he says in the word what is so confirmed is confirmed in our own experience that getting dressed really doesn't, for church, really doesn't just happen on Sunday morning.
[time=1954] All of us make decisions about how we're going to dress by the magazines that we look at, we see people on television and they have a certain style and we say that looks like I'd like to look like and there are reasons behind that.
[time=1968] We form an image if you will and some of that is curtailed or given liberation by our income as we are able to buy certain kinds of clothing.
[time=1977] It is really an expression of who we are and then we have the very delicate task of going shopping.
[time=1982] And there we find ourselves in a very high powered environment that is designed to get us to want to buy what they are selling and they have very well trained people that encourage us to do that.
[time=1993] I don't know if that happens to you, but it happens to me. I'll go out with an intention to buy a new tie or a new suit or some kind of clothing that I need for some occasion.
[time=2002] Something is worn out and I need to replace it and I come home with something entirely different than I intended to buy.
[time=2008] And I don't like it after I get home and I never wear it because it's out of sync with who I am.
[time=2014] This idea of getting dressed for church really begins with our thought processes and what we think about ourselves and what we are influenced by and then it comes to a critical point when we go out and lay our money down on the line.
[time=2026] It's my practice never to go shopping by myself. I always take along a buddy or two and they are always shopping too so it doesn't look weird but we are checking each other out.
[time=2037] We are saying that fits, don't get carried away with that or that wouldn't be right or that's a little bit much or that's not it.
[time=2043] You didn't say you were going to spend that much. Why are you buying those three extra shirts?
[time=2046] You know how you need that kind of help. That's what it means.
[time=2049] It's the part of your person that is done in an orderly and appropriate way. Your lifestyle is communicated in your attire to some degree or another.
[time=2060] And women have the very delicate responsibility of coming to church in a way that is both becoming of the beauty and the grace of womanhood but it is also appropriate to be in the worship center.
[time=2075] The issue here is that women do not dress in such a way that they are distracting from the worship of God and that's hard to do because on the one hand you are supposed to adorn yourself.
[time=2087] You are supposed to be orderly and proper and becoming and you are a woman and God has made you to be the way you are and it's beautiful.
[time=2094] It's delightful but somehow that has to be tapered in a way that is appropriate such that it doesn't become an ostentatious display of your own glory and in that detract from the glory of God.
[time=2106] It's a delicate line to walk.
[time=2109] Now he goes beyond this general exhortation and he becomes very specific.
[time=2113] Would you look towards the end of verse 9, proper clothing modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments.
[time=2124] And here he becomes very specific about an extravagant way of dressing.
[time=2128] The idea of braided hair or plating I think is the old word for it and we don't know exactly what it would have looked like but it was a braiding of the hair, a certain braiding of the hair.
[time=2137] My guess is it probably looks a lot of the same as the ways we've learned to do it in our day and age.
[time=2142] And in addition to the braiding of the hair they would then take pearls and gold and jewelry and they would wind it in the braiding of their hair and come up with these unbelievable hairdos that would carry at times their entire fortune.
[time=2158] They didn't have banks, they didn't have safe deposits, they were more apt to find the safest place for their wealth on their person.
[time=2167] And it's interesting to note that in this particular day though gold was incredibly valuable, pearls were worth three times as much as gold and didn't have the weight of gold.
[time=2178] And so it's easy for you to envision how they would put all of that in their hair.
[time=2185] They would overdo it. You say is it wrong to put our little girls in pigtails, is it wrong to do our hair up to braid our hair and the answer is of course not, it's not wrong.
[time=2197] There's a huge difference between braiding your hair and braiding your hair with your fortune in it.
[time=2207] So it is that we should not be flaunting our wealth.
[time=2211] The other thing that comes to our minds is is it wrong for us to wear a gold at all or have a pearl and I should say not.
[time=2219] I gave my wife a gold ring when I married her and I've since given her a necklace and I've told her it's okay that she wears that.
[time=2227] I mean I've got about 60 bucks in that stuff you know.
[time=2230] See you have some pearls on today Heidi, looks lovely.
[time=2235] See that's not wrong, that's all part and parcel of the adornment process.
[time=2241] What is wrong is when we dress it up with the intent of our heart to detract from the worship of God and draw people's attention to ourselves.
[time=2251] When that becomes the focus or the attention of a woman's heart it reveals that she has not really come to worship God.
[time=2258] And not only is she a distraction to those of us who have but she is missing out on the joy and the wonder of worshiping God on a Sunday morning.
[time=2266] We are not here for ourselves, we are here for God to give him the glory that is due his name.
[time=2271] One writer puts it this way.
[time=2273] And what then is modest apparel such as covers them completely and decently not with superfluous ornaments?
[time=2280] For the one is decent and the other is not.
[time=2283] What do you approach God to pray with broiled hair ornaments of gold?
[time=2289] Are you coming to a ball, to a marriage feast, to a carnival?
[time=2294] There such costly things might have been seasonable.
[time=2298] Here no one of them is wanted.
[time=2301] You are come to pray, to ask pardon for your sins, to plead for your offenses beseeching the Lord and hoping to render him propitious to you away with such hypocrisy.
[time=2312] That's the spirit of what's being said here.
[time=2315] Get rid of that hypocrisy from your life, there is no place for it.
[time=2319] And that is what so desperately concerns me about so much of what is on the television with respect to evangelical or allegedly evangelical ministries.
[time=2329] People are on these television shows and they represent Christ and they name the name of Christ and they represent to the masses what we say we represent.
[time=2337] And yet they have this atrocious consuming preoccupation with their own appearance.
[time=2343] And it belies the entire effort that speaks poorly of the Christian faith.
[time=2351] It is not to characterize the believer in the process of worship.
[time=2356] So a woman is to adorn herself, not in a way that attracts attention to herself but is honoring to God and reveals her own heart to honor God at the same time.
[time=2366] Now I do want to say just a brief word to the single women in our midst who might be thinking now that sounds nice but I'm not married and I've got to attract somebody soon.
[time=2379] This is not just a sermon to you, this is life, this is me getting married or not me getting married and I want to express my understanding of that and my sensitivity to that and I think it is appropriate for women to properly adorn themselves and to be attractive in that sense of the word as well.
[time=2395] I'm just saying that in the text I believe is saying that that should not be the thrust in your attire and the way that you get ready for the worship service.
[time=2403] And we would caution you as well, don't be talked into somebody who is primarily attracted to you because of your physical beauty.
[time=2411] As beautiful as you may be, that is not enough, marriages are not built on physical beauty alone, they are built on the inner beauty, the quiet disposition of the heart.
[time=2421] And as life goes on and as familiarity with your particular beauty breeds, if your man has only come to you because of your outward appearance he will soon find others that are fresh and new and different.
[time=2436] And then as we all continue to age and lose a bit of the luster or at least the youthful side of our appearance, there is a wonderful beauty and grace in women that age with the Lord and the softness of their countenance and the glory that is there in what the Bible calls the older women.
[time=2455] Not to in any way mitigate that, but the sensual or the young or the fresh side of a bride and all of her splendor.
[time=2465] If that is all that's been attractive in the physical appearance, then you've got the wrong man, which allows us to talk to the single men for a moment as well.
[time=2474] Men, you have got to be attracted to the godly virtues of women and lift that up and make that the priority of your life and allow yourself to be drawn to women who may not be capable of starring in some soap opera somewhere as the most beautiful thing that ever walked on the face of the earth.
[time=2491] But she is certainly a beautiful and pleasant woman, but more than that inside of her heart is the godliness that will last all your life long and will be right as you try to raise a family and have a partnership and a marriage for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2506] We are inundated with this message over and over and over again that the whole thing is skin deep.
[time=2513] And so many of the men that I used to counsel at the college and others were waiting for, you know, a miscover of cosmopolitan to walk into their life and throw herself at their feet and say, "I want to be your Proverbs 31 woman."
[time=2527] And that is ridiculous.
[time=2529] There is more to us than that.
[time=2532] God has given women a beauty and it is to be enjoyed by the husband in that sense, and there's nothing wrong with that, but that is not the totality of what God gives us.
[time=2542] God gives us in a life partner.
[time=2546] So that would be the attire.
[time=2548] But what about the attitude?
[time=2551] What does he say about their attitude?
[time=2553] It's in the middle of verse 9.
[time=2554] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing and then these two words modestly and discreetly.
[time=2561] Modestly, this is an interesting word, it appears only here in the New Testament, and it combines the sense of modesty and the sense of humility.
[time=2571] The root idea in this word is that of shame, interestingly enough.
[time=2575] Shame.
[time=2576] Not to be ashamed of being a woman, not to be ashamed of being what God has made you to be.
[time=2582] The idea that I am would be absolutely shamed at the thought that I would ever contribute to a man's lustful thought or an illicit thought.
[time=2591] The thought of dressing in such a way that I would provoke a lustful thought or an improper thought in the harder mind of a man is absolutely shameful to me.
[time=2601] An aitly reacting and rejecting of anything that dishonors God and his sense of modesty and morality.
[time=2609] A shrinking back from the limits of womanly modesty.
[time=2615] The word also carries a sense of grief in the heart of a woman.
[time=2619] In other words, that she would be so sensitive to sin, so hating sin that offends God that she would never do anything that would come close to generating a sinful attitude in another person's mind.
[time=2629] She wants nothing to do and has nothing to do with desires that go beyond honorable, pure, modest, proper attire and lifestyle in this category.
[time=2638] No desire to flaunt her sexuality. That would bring shame to her.
[time=2643] See, that's the attitude. And I've seen that in women. I see that in my wife.
[time=2648] There is just nothing in her that wants to display an unwholesome sense of sensuality. It's repulsive to her.
[time=2657] And a lot of you men will sense that if you're in a situation whether it's a television show or somebody's conversation and it goes off color and you'll notice your wife just backs up.
[time=2667] Just immediately wants to be out. That's what this word is.
[time=2671] You're that way because that's how you're supposed to be. That's true modesty.
[time=2676] It's not a pretend thing. It's a real genuine I want away from that stuff. That's bad. That's not right.
[time=2683] The other word is self-control. And it also carries self-mastery over anything that is sensual.
[time=2691] In the extra biblical literature it talks about an absolute control of passion and desire.
[time=2698] Plato said it was the cardinal virtue. And when applied to women said it had to do with their sexual desires being totally controlled.
[time=2707] Now this was a problem at Ephesus and the Church of Ephesus.
[time=2711] These women were coming into the assembly. And they were not only putting on a show about their own beauty and their own wealth,
[time=2718] but there was an intent in them to arouse these sexual and sensual desires in men
[time=2724] and for many of them in the hope that an illicit relationship would be given birth to.
[time=2731] As you remember the church at Ephesus and the city of Ephesus surrounded and dominated by this influence of the temple Diana.
[time=2738] And that was filled with these temple prostitutes and they would dress just this way.
[time=2743] They would put on the braided hair and the gold and the pearls and the costly garments and then they would parade through the city.
[time=2749] Philo's description of a prostitute in his writing called the sacrifices of Cain and Abel.
[time=2755] I quote, "a prostitute is often described as having hair dressed in elaborate braids, her eyes with pencil lines,
[time=2762] her eyebrows smothered in paint and her expensive clothes embroidered lavishly with flowers and bracelets and necklaces of gold and jewels hanging all over her."
[time=2772] They would just completely overdo it.
[time=2776] They would put it on their fingers. They'd put it on their dresses. They'd put that stuff in their hair. They'd put it on their sandals.
[time=2783] But it was more than just materialism. It was a sign of the day that I am available. I am interested. I am loose.
[time=2792] And that was a problem in this church. Come with me to chapter 3, verse 2, talking here about the qualifications of elders.
[time=2807] And it says in overseer, that's just another word for elder, then must be above reproach. And then it says the husband of one wife.
[time=2813] And we'll talk about this in greater detail when we get to this text, but what that basically means is a one woman man.
[time=2819] It doesn't just mean that he's only married to one woman. It means he's devoted to that woman.
[time=2824] That's the idea, and they were struggling with that. That's why Paul put it in here as a category.
[time=2829] Now flip back to chapter 1. Do you remember the false teachers that he confronted in chapter 1?
[time=2834] They were giving a false gospel, and they were men of disrepute, and he goes on to likely describe their own problems.
[time=2844] Verse 10, he says immoral men and homosexuals, they had reached a level of sensuality in that church that was utterly inappropriate.
[time=2854] Now come to chapter 5, and you'll see the same thing being said of the women.
[time=2862] The older women, chapter 5, verse 2, as mothers, the younger women as sisters in what? In all purity.
[time=2871] Now look at verse 6, "But she who gives herself to wanton pleasures is dead even while she lives."
[time=2879] Down to verse 11, "But refused to put younger widows on the list, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ,
[time=2886] they want to get married, thus incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge."
[time=2893] In other words, they were in a setting much like ours, a cultural influence under the temple diana that was absolutely infiltrating their minds
[time=2903] and their hearts, their church, with this immorality, with this abandonment to sexual pleasure.
[time=2911] And Paul is saying that can't happen in our church. We can't bring that kind of stuff in here.
[time=2917] When you prepare yourself to come into the household of God, prepare yourself to worship, not to be worshipped,
[time=2924] not to try to create in the sanctuary of some man's heart, an illicit thought, and a sinful desire, and inappropriate attitude.
[time=2941] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair,
[time=2949] and gold, and pearls, or costly garments. And of course that would be the tragedy of our day.
[time=2956] There are so many churches that are so full of this kind of problem where men and women are not faithful to each other,
[time=2966] and where affairs go on, an adultery is committed.
[time=2970] And that happens at the level of the elders, and that happens at the level of the pastors.
[time=2976] And, you know, it's just obvious that our culture is rife with that, and I can think of situations in my past,
[time=2984] in being on a pastoral staff of some 30-minute Grace Community Church, where a guy would come into my office, and he would be heavy of heart, and he would shut the door,
[time=2996] and he would sit down, and he would say, "There is a woman in this church that will not leave me alone,
[time=3002] and she is pursuing me, and it started very subtly, and now it has escalated, and it's completely out of control,
[time=3008] and he would confess, "I'm beginning to sense some inclination in my own heart towards that, and say I'm losing my one woman man qualification as an elder and as a deacon,
[time=3019] and we would pray together, and we would talk about that, and we would hold each other accountable, and we would alert his secretary to that particular person in a very confidential way,
[time=3030] and the rest of us would know that if we were ever to see those two doing anything, that would be outside of walking by each other in a public assembly to go and rescue in a more severe way,
[time=3042] that situation, that happens. That can happen here. It is a violation of why we meet.
[time=3052] We meet to worship and to glorify God, and to end that pledge our allegiance to him and our fidelity to our mates.
[time=3063] It happens. It happened in the Old Testament.
[time=3067] Let me read to you a portion of Scripture out of Isaiah, Isaiah chapter 3.
[time=3073] When we come to this particular period in history, the King Josiah has been on the throne for some 52 years,
[time=3079] and he was a very successful king, and under his leadership, great prosperity had occurred.
[time=3085] And with that, the women had lost themselves in gross materialism.
[time=3091] I'm going to read from Isaiah chapter 3 verse 16 as I hear some of you turning your pages.
[time=3096] Moreover, the Lord said, "Because the daughters of Zion are proud, and walk with heads held high and seductive eyes."
[time=3103] That's their attempt of alluring. And go along with mensing steps.
[time=3108] The word mensing is, I believe it describes a type of walk that is very sensual.
[time=3113] I think it has short little quick steps, and it attracts attention.
[time=3119] And tinkle the bangles on their feet. Therefore, the Lord will afflict the scalp of the daughters of Zion with scabs.
[time=3126] And the Lord will make their foreheads bare.
[time=3129] In that day, the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, headbands, crescent ornaments, dangling earrings, bracelets, veils,
[time=3136] headdresses, ankle chains, sashes, perfume boxes, omelets, finger rings, nose rings, festival robes,
[time=3143] outer tunics, cloaks, money purses, hand mirrors, undergarments, turbines and veils.
[time=3149] I mean, the whole kitten caboodle just gone. Take it all away.
[time=3153] Because you've used it the wrong way. It's not that those things are wrong.
[time=3160] Then verse 24, now it will come about that instead of sweet perfume, there will be putrification.
[time=3165] Instead of a belt, a rope. Instead of a well-set hair, a plucked-out sculpt.
[time=3172] Instead of fine clothes, a donning of sackcloth, and branding instead of beauty,
[time=3178] your men will fall by the sword, your mighty ones in battle, and her gates will lament and mourn.
[time=3185] And deserted, she will sit on the ground.
[time=3189] That's God's reaction. That's God's reaction to improper adornment, the improper attitude of the heart.
[time=3198] That would say, I have come to church to draw attention to myself, and I have come to church to allure and men some special thrill that I think they're looking at me in a way that they shouldn't, and almost wondering and hoping that if circumstances would work out, that more could come of that.
[time=3217] So there is this tension that exists, existed in the Ephesian church, and to some degree could exist in ours.
[time=3224] Here this little church in the city of Ephesus is in the middle of a corrupt world endeavoring to be a testimony of godliness to everyone around it.
[time=3231] But if the church catches this disease of the world, then it brings reproach on Christ, it destroys its own testimony.
[time=3239] To have women in the church who are supposed to be the epitome of godliness appear as prostitutes as God-y, showy women trying to call attention to themselves, violates the intent of worship.
[time=3253] You see, what are we to do about it? What are we to do about it?
[time=3257] Well, first of all, I want to say something which really comes from my heart, and it's a little bit of a risky thing to say any time you comment on women's apparel, you immediately open yourself up to people saying, well, why does he notice that?
[time=3271] But at risk of that, I want to say that I'm really proud of the women of Blackhawk.
[time=3277] I think you do us right. I think you guys really do live this passage.
[time=3284] I think that your adornment is appropriate, and it is gracious, and it speaks of a hard attitude that I believe fills your heart and your soul and your mind.
[time=3294] And I am thrilled that some of the people that I'm getting to know slowly, but surely some of the ladies of our church and the joy that emanates from their eyes and the softness that I feel in their countenance, because they're women of God.
[time=3308] And it flows up deep from within them, and it's the product of a life that has been consecrated to God, and you meet them, and you see their ministry, and you learn about their family, and you go, my land's there, it is.
[time=3319] There's a biblical woman. Our church is full of you.
[time=3323] And I believe the men would agree with me in that we are blessed to have you.
[time=3327] You are appropriate.
[time=3329] But how would we deal with that beyond that?
[time=3332] I mean, how would you as women find a grid, possibly, to think that through for yourself?
[time=3337] And you know, these words are in some sense rather general, modest and discreet, but it all comes back to your heart.
[time=3343] God looks on the heart, and He's looking on your heart, and it's not the idea that we would ever try to police this as a church and put people at the door that inspect, you know, to say, "Well, you're too immodest.
[time=3354] You can't come in church, go home and change." I mean, that would be the absolute violation of worship as well.
[time=3359] This is something that goes on inside of your heart, ladies, and you ask yourself several questions.
[time=3364] It's a motive check.
[time=3366] How is my spirit? What is the intent of my heart?
[time=3370] Why have I dressed the way I have dressed?
[time=3373] What is my goal behind my dress and my attire?
[time=3377] Is it to honor my Lord?
[time=3379] God, Jesus Christ, is it to honor my husband and to be an example to my children?
[time=3384] What is your object?
[time=3387] Are you doing everything in your power to draw everyone's attention to God or to yourself?
[time=3393] And that's really what it comes down to.
[time=3395] There's nothing more that we could do.
[time=3397] I guess there would be a time where if it were absolutely inappropriate, we could approach some of the godly women in our family.
[time=3405] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our living Christmas tree choir
[time=3412] and our children's choirs.
[time=3414] The message today was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3418] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3422] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3426] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to be born in a manger and eventually to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3436] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3439] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3444] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3448] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3452] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
