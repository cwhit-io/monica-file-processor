[time=31] - Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=38] Thank you for joining us.
[time=40] Today, Pastor Moore's message is entitled The Christ of Christmas.
[time=44] Even for Christians, it is so easy to let the shopping
[time=50] and other activities of the Christmas season crowd out the true meaning.
[time=54] For this hour at least, let your heart and mind focus on God's gift to mankind.
[time=60] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study with us.
[time=64] Our special music today will include our LCT choir with soloists, Joni King and Amanda Smith.
[time=73] It will also feature the Men's Trio and a medley by Susan Toyrac Stump and Scott Schindler.
[time=81] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's listen to the Living Christmas Tree Choir as they sing a medley entitled "O come, all ye faithful." (gentle music)

[time=775] - Good morning and thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour.
[time=782] We're so thankful for our partnership with you as we faithfully teach God's Word and share our worship service with you as we try to exalt the living and true God.
[time=791] I want to wish you a Merry Christmas, and I hope that you've enjoyed the Christmas holiday and that you're anticipating the new year, and that God has given you a sense of excitement about what he's going to do in your life in 1992.
[time=802] I'm thrilled to say that I have my entire family with me this morning.
[time=805] I'd like you to meet them.
[time=806] I want to introduce my wife, Heidi.
[time=808] - Hello.
[time=809] We're so glad to be here in Indiana.
[time=810] We have found the people to be delightful, and it's been a joy to be here to minister in this church.
[time=816] - Thank you.
[time=817] Have my daughters here as well, obviously.
[time=819] This one here, the one on your far left is Randy.
[time=822] She's my eldest daughter.
[time=824] She's 10 years old, and we're so excited to see the evidence of salvation in her life.
[time=829] She prayed to receive Christ some years ago, and we continue to see the Lord work in that out and giving her fruit in her life.
[time=835] She's in the fifth grade and played on the volleyball team this year and is taking up the flute and playing the piano, so we're excited about all that's going on in her life.
[time=845] This is Nikki.
[time=846] She's our second eldest, and Nikki is seven years old, and she's in the second grade and excited about being on the chess club, and we're really proud of what the Lord is doing in her life as well.
[time=857] In the middle, our blonde-haired blue-eyed daughter is Kelly, and Kelly's in the first grade, and she's just turned six, and Kelly loves to sing and loves to go to school, and she does, you know, her school worked very, very well, and we're thankful for her as well.
[time=872] And then our youngest, kind of our caboose, if you will, is our little Whitney, and Whitney's two years old.
[time=877] Her birthday was December 2nd, and she has been the perfect compliment, really, to our family.
[time=882] She just adds a sense of joy and excitement that children can, and so we're thankful for her as well.
[time=888] I don't know if you're with your family this Christmas, or if you're going to be separated from that, from your family, but I pray that you've joyously rejoicing in your heart over what God has given you by way of your family.
[time=901] And as you anticipate, 1992, we want you to know that we're offering you the daily walk Bible calendar, and it'll take you week, day by day, through the year, and as you come to a new page of the calendar, there'll be a verse, and then there'll be a thought for the day and a devotion, and there'll be a amount of scripture that you could read that'll take you through the Bible in that year.
[time=924] We'd like to offer that to you, and you can receive that by writing us here at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468-15.
[time=934] Once again, that's 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 468-15.
[time=941] Well, thank you very much, and we'll return now to the regular portion of our service.
[time=945] [MUSIC - 471 seconds]
[time=1426] What we're going to depart this morning from our typical study in the book of Timothy and focus in on the Christ of Christmas and to do that, I'll ask you to take your Bible and open it to Luke chapter 2. And just thinking about Christmas I'm realizing how thankful I am for the traditions of Christmas that have been handed to me.
[time=1444] By my father and mother, this will be our first Christmas away from them celebrating this on our own, and we're looking forward to that in one sense.
[time=1454] It's time to start our own traditions, and we're thankful for that, but there is the natural sense of loss, and kind of our mind will drift back to where they are and what they might be doing now.
[time=1464] But for years, Christmas for the Moore family, I have three older sisters, would begin on Christmas morning. That was really the day that we opened our gifts.
[time=1471] And the first person up would have the joy and responsibility of waking everybody else up, and after we'd gone to the bathroom to make necessary repairs and to brush our teeth and to get into our pajamas and all that stuff so that we're presentable for the rest of the morning, we would then line up.
[time=1487] Youngest to eldest, and we would start our Christmas carol, joy to the world, and we'd carol our way into the living room, and the doors had been shut from that night before, and my folks would never put all their Christmas presents out.
[time=1501] They'd put enough out to make it look like a Christmas tree, but they'd always tuck them somewhere, and so that Christmas Eve, when we were asleep, they'd load it up, you know, and try to make it look as big as they possibly can, and we'd bust through the doors, and there it would be, and we'd be amazed and thrilled and thankful.
[time=1514] We'd pause for a word of prayer to thank our God for the gift of Christ, and then my dad would put on the old Santa Claus hat, and how if we'd go, and it'd be one present at a time, and we'd watch that person open that gift, and then that person would say thank you and move to the next, and usually as you sometimes would have in your own home, it will take us two, three, four hours to get through all this.
[time=1534] But I'm thankful for that tradition, and tradition is good, and tradition is helpful, it is that value or tradition is that which helps us reinforce our beliefs and our values, and to that extent tradition is very helpful.
[time=1547] The things I take away from that tradition, the values and the beliefs are one, I'm thankful that my dad was the leader of our home, and he established that tradition, and he was definitely giving us direction and leadership through that entire season as he did the rest of the year.
[time=1561] I take from that Christmas tradition a very definite focus on the person of Christ as we sang the Carol, and as we stopped and waited first to pray, and then we'd very carefully watch everybody else receive their gifts as if to say this is really only a small gift in light of what Christ has given us in his own life.
[time=1579] I take away from that tradition the value and belief and the strong Christian family, and I am looking forward to starting our own traditions here, because I want to pass that on to my daughter.
[time=1589] So I'm sure that your tradition is in some way similar to that, but that is what we get from tradition, that's why societies and cultures give tradition.
[time=1597] The inherited, established or customary pattern of thought, action or behavior designed to reinforce, protect and guard beliefs and values, and it can be very helpful.
[time=1608] At the same time tradition can be very dangerous.
[time=1612] We can lose our focus and begin to celebrate the tradition itself, rather than the beliefs and the values we originally put that tradition in place to reinforce.
[time=1623] With tradition it can be so embellished that the facts are actually lost.
[time=1630] And that may be true for many of us and for many of the world around us with respect to Christmas.
[time=1636] Over the years, singers and storytellers have so embellished the legend of Christmas that most people don't know which details are factual and which are just fiction.
[time=1647] Where the biblical account stops and where the traditional account starts, for example.
[time=1653] Did the angels really sing?
[time=1656] We sing the song, "Hark the Herald Angels Sing." We sing it this morning, it's a lovely song.
[time=1661] Did the angels really sing? Look at Luke chapter 2 with me for a minute.
[time=1665] Verse 10, "And the angels said to them, 'Do not be afraid, for behold I bring you good news of great joy which shall be for all the people.'
[time=1673] For today in the city of David there has been born for you a Savior who has Christ the Lord.
[time=1679] And this will be a sign for you and you will find a baby wrapped in clothes lying in a manger."
[time=1685] Verse 13, "And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God and what?"
[time=1692] Saying, saying glory to God in the highest and earth peace among men with whom God is well pleased.
[time=1699] As a matter of fact, the Bible only says that angels actually sing twice.
[time=1704] One is in Job chapter 38, except the creation of the world and the angels here are referred to as the Morning Stars,
[time=1711] which is kind of an elliptic illusion or it's another name for angels.
[time=1714] And it says there clearly that at creation the angels sang.
[time=1718] The other place the Bible says the angels sing is in Revelation chapter 5 verses 8, 9, and 10.
[time=1723] It's the end of the age and they are clearly singing. It says they're singing to the glory of the Lamb, Jesus Christ.
[time=1731] So it's as if to say the angels sang at the beginning or the creation of the world, but since the curse, and until that is finally removed at the end of the age they don't sing, they just talk.
[time=1741] What about the manger scene?
[time=1743] When we think about a manger scene we think of snow and we think of the singing angels and the many worshipers,
[time=1750] the wise men and the shepherds and talking animals and a little drummer boy going, you know, rump a tump tump and all that.
[time=1757] None of that is found in the biblical account.
[time=1760] Again, I'll call your attention to Luke chapter 2 verses 16 and 17.
[time=1763] This is basically all the Bible says about the manger.
[time=1766] They came in haste and found their way to Mary and Joseph and the baby as he lay in the manger.
[time=1772] And when they had seen this, and that's the word we pack so much into, and when they had seen this they made known the statement which had been told them about this Christ.
[time=1781] We really don't know what the manger scene looked like other than it was a manger and Jesus was lying in the manger.
[time=1788] And then there is this question about the magi or the wise men or the we three kings from Morientile.
[time=1797] You can stay in Luke, I'm going to run over to Matthew for just a minute where these magi are described.
[time=1802] It says this, they came into the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother,
[time=1809] and they fell down and worshiped him and opening their treasures.
[time=1812] They presented to him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
[time=1815] They saw Jesus in a house, not a manger.
[time=1819] They probably weren't there the first night of his birth.
[time=1822] They may have showed up a day later or three days later or two months later or three months later after Jesus had been moved out of the manger and put in a house.
[time=1831] It's the shepherds who came to see him in the manger, the magi found him in a house.
[time=1836] It's also interesting to note that the magi are nowhere said to be kings and that is nowhere said that there are three of them.
[time=1842] That's all tradition.
[time=1845] And then there is this question about the date of Christmas.
[time=1848] Is it really December 25th?
[time=1850] And again we are left with our hands in the air saying, well I don't know, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
[time=1855] Some would suggest that it's not December 25th.
[time=1858] Look at your Bible again, Luke chapter 2 verse 8.
[time=1861] The shepherds are there in the same region.
[time=1864] Some shepherds staying out in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.
[time=1868] That would have been a very unusual occurrence at December in Jerusalem and the surrounding areas.
[time=1874] Bethlehem.
[time=1875] It's very cold and what the shepherds would have done would have moved their flock in tight, put them in a stable of some kind or in some fenced area, which would have been right next to a house.
[time=1885] And the shepherd would have been in the house because it's very cold.
[time=1888] Here it says the shepherds were in the fields keeping watch over their flock by night.
[time=1892] Could it have happened?
[time=1893] Yes it could have happened, but probably not.
[time=1896] How do we end up with December 25th?
[time=1898] Well it's not from the early church.
[time=1900] The early church didn't celebrate December 25th as Christmas.
[time=1903] In fact they went right over Christmas and gave most of their attention to the resurrection.
[time=1908] The New Testament church, the early church was more concerned with the resurrection than they were with the birth of Christ.
[time=1913] Our focus on December 25th came from the Roman holiday Saturnalia.
[time=1918] Saturnalia was a pagan observance of the birthday of the unconquered sun, the kind that shines in the sky.
[time=1925] Saturnalia was celebrated December 19 to 26, seven days and it was characteristic by feasting and parades and special music and gift giving and candle lighting and green trees.
[time=1937] Sound familiar?
[time=1939] As Christianity spread through the Roman Empire, the pagan holiday was given Christian connotations when in 336 Emperor Constantine declared Christ's birthday an official Roman holiday.
[time=1951] That's where we get our date.
[time=1953] Really not from biblical truth or fact.
[time=1956] So we find then the danger of tradition overgrowing the facts of Christmas.
[time=1962] And frankly I don't know that it matters all that much, how we decorate our mangers.
[time=1973] I don't think that the Lord is really all that concerned or if we sing "Heart the Herald Angels Sing" I mean there's the thought they were singing in their hearts.
[time=1974] I mean sure they were rejoicing.
[time=1976] What is the actual date?
[time=1977] We don't know how many magi showed up.
[time=1979] When did they show up?
[time=1980] Where do they find Jesus?
[time=1981] I mean the Bible I don't think really cares.
[time=1983] I don't think God really cares.
[time=1984] These are things that can be somewhat masked in our tradition and we are at liberty to embellish some of that all for our Christmas story.
[time=1991] But there is one central fact that surrounds the Christmas story which must not be lost.
[time=1997] It must not be obscured.
[time=1999] It must not be changed.
[time=2000] In fact it must be guarded and protected like no other fact with respect to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2008] If this one fact is not true we have nothing to celebrate at Christmas.
[time=2014] If this one fact is not true we have no savior.
[time=2018] We have no forgiveness.
[time=2020] We have no salvation and we have no hope.
[time=2024] What is that one simple fact about Christmas which must not be clouded by tradition?
[time=2031] Well turn back a page to Luke chapter 1 verses 26 and following and you'll find the fact.
[time=2038] Over and overstated in both the accounts of the nativity scene.
[time=2043] Luke chapter 1 verse 26 now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth.
[time=2051] Verse 27 to a what?
[time=2054] To a virgin.
[time=2056] Engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the descendants of David and the virgin's name was Mary.
[time=2063] After the angel explains what's going to happen Mary's response is found in verse 34 and Mary said to the angel.
[time=2069] How can this be since I am a virgin and the angel answered and said to her the Holy Spirit will come upon you
[time=2077] and the power of the most high will overshadow you and for that reason the holy offspring shall be called what?
[time=2084] The son of God.
[time=2087] It is the virgin birth of Christ that is much much different than the number of the magi than the date of Christmas
[time=2094] than whether or not the angel is actually saying it is in fact the foundation of everything we celebrate in Christmas.
[time=2102] The virgin birth is an underlying assumption in everything the Bible says about Jesus Christ.
[time=2107] And to throw out the virgin birth is not only to deny the accuracy and the veracity of scripture but to reject the deity of Christ.
[time=2116] And no one issue is more important to our understanding of who the person of Jesus Christ is than the fact that he was born of a virgin
[time=2123] and therefore is the son of God.
[time=2128] Without the virgin birth Christ, excuse me, Christmas has no point at all.
[time=2134] If Jesus is simply the illegitimate child of Mary's infidelity or even if he is the child of Joseph's natural marital union with Mary he is not God.
[time=2145] If he is not God his claims are lies. If his claims are lies his salvation is a hoax. If his salvation is a hoax we're all doomed.
[time=2156] That is why Christmas is not preeminently a celebration of the Savior's infancy but a celebration of his deity.
[time=2164] Christmas is ultimately a celebration of the deity of Christ.
[time=2169] And the world is happy to let Jesus Christ be a baby and a manger. They just aren't willing to let him be the sovereign king and Lord of Lords.
[time=2178] Yet that is the central truth of the Christmas story.
[time=2182] Lots of people would otherwise gladly embrace Jesus as the Messiah just not that he be God.
[time=2189] They will welcome him as the son of David but not as the son of God. They don't mind celebrating the birth of a baby.
[time=2194] They just don't want to celebrate the birth of the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.
[time=2199] They sing of his nativity but brazenly reject his authority.
[time=2204] They adore him as an infant but will not pay homage to him as the God man.
[time=2208] They can tolerate the trappings of Christmas, a manger, shepherds, wise men and Joseph and Mary but they cannot bear the advent of God in human flesh.
[time=2220] And this has been the question that has plagued the life of Christ since his birth.
[time=2226] In Matthew chapter 16 he stands with his disciples and he says this, "Who do men say that I am? Who do men say that I am?" And they respond to him, "Well, sons say you're John the Baptist." And others say that you're Elijah. And others say that you're Jeremiah.
[time=2242] And still others say that you are one of the prophets.
[time=2245] And this is a noble group of men. This is a great group with which to be grouped.
[time=2250] But there is a common thread in all of those responses. Those are all just mere men.
[time=2255] And then Peter finally said it, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." In other words affirming his deity. Peter affirms what is true of Christ in the manger that he was born of a virgin and is the very son of God.
[time=2270] And people have been attacking the virgin birth ever since Christ was born.
[time=2275] One theory says that Christ was born of a Roman soldier, that Jesus was the illegitimate child of a Roman soldier who had a love affair with Mary.
[time=2283] In support of this theory the proponent points out that Nazareth was located on the main highway between Jerusalem
[time=2289] and the Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon. And Nazareth did indeed have a rather notorious reputation, notorious reputation for corruption, vice and prostitution.
[time=2299] Another theory says that Jesus is the product of a neighbor.
[time=2303] And as early as the 8th century an extremist anti-Christian cult popularized the teaching that after Joseph and Mary were married
[time=2310] she unwittingly conceived a child by having sex with a neighbor who came to her in the dark of night.
[time=2315] According to the legend Joseph knew he was not the father so he left Mary after she delivered the son.
[time=2321] A book entitled "The Passover Plot" by Hugh Schoenfield, popularized in the 1960s, postulates that Jesus was the natural son of Joseph and Mary.
[time=2330] Jesus was nothing but a master conspirator who thought he could be the Messiah.
[time=2335] Schoenfield says this, I quote, "There was nothing peculiar about the birth of Jesus. He was not God incarnate and no virgin mother bore him.
[time=2342] The church and its ancient zeal fathered a myth and became bound to its dogma."
[time=2348] Beyond these direct attacks there are subtle attacks through antiquity and through a number of different religions claiming the equivalent of the virgin birth.
[time=2355] Rick mythology taught that Dionysius was the god of wine and was born out of the union of his human mother, simile, the god Zeus.
[time=2364] In ancient Assyrian mythology, Samaria's wife of Nimrod gave birth to Tamuz who was supposedly conceived by a sunbeam.
[time=2373] That legend was adopted into Egyptian mythology where the two are known as Isis and Osiris.
[time=2380] In India the same tale is told of Isis and Iswara.
[time=2384] The Chinese have evidence of an ancient mother cult known as the Xing Mu.
[time=2389] Their artwork picturing the holy mother holding a baby in her arms looks strikingly similar to Christian art portraying Mary.
[time=2396] In Phoenicia it was Astroth and Baal was the child. One legend about Buddha claims he was miraculously conceived when an elephant entered his mother's belly ten months later Buddha was born.
[time=2408] Olympus, the mother of Alexander the Great often asserted that her child was the product and conceived by the gods.
[time=2416] And then of course there is the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception which is oftentimes confused with the virgin birth.
[time=2423] They suggest in the Immaculate Conception that Mary was conceived in her mother's womb as a sinless being preserved from the effects of Adam's sin.
[time=2432] There is no biblical support for that. The Bible says nothing about it.
[time=2436] In fact it is the invention of the medieval church not even recognized as official Catholic dogma until Pope Pius IX declared it so in 1854.
[time=2446] Mary knew she needed a savior. Mary knew she had nothing close to an Immaculate Conception as it says in Luke 1, 46 and 47.
[time=2453] She rejoiced in the giving of a savior for she knew she needed it.
[time=2458] So the virgin birth is one of these facts which must always stay separate from fiction.
[time=2464] We must not allow it to become obscured by our traditions and we must not allow it to be brushed off as if it were tradition.
[time=2471] It is the central message of the Christian Christmas story.
[time=2475] There is no question that Jesus Christ is God.
[time=2480] We can not only look at his virgin birth but if you come with me to John chapter 14, Jesus is over and over again saying that he is God.
[time=2490] Sharing that with the people not to pride himself but to allow them to recognize him and follow his feet and worship and be saved.
[time=2497] But just briefly this morning and we could spend days really talking about the deity of Christ.
[time=2504] But just three brief vignettes of the deity of Jesus Christ.
[time=2509] One, he demonstrated that he was God through his miracles.
[time=2513] Two, he demonstrated he was God by accepting worship as God.
[time=2517] And three, he flat out claimed he was God.
[time=2520] But we will begin with the demonstration that he was God.
[time=2524] John chapter 14 verse 11.
[time=2528] Here in his identity is again in question and he says believe me that I am in the Father and the Father and me.
[time=2534] That's another just a claim of deity.
[time=2536] Then he says this otherwise if you don't believe me just because I say so, believe on account of the works themselves.
[time=2542] The works themselves Jesus left no doubt in anybody's mind that he was God.
[time=2548] As he walked and lived his life when he began his public ministry at about the age of 30 until he was crucified at the age of 33.
[time=2556] He went on an absolute rampage of healing sickness, disease, blindness, paralytics.
[time=2562] In fact the book of John is written and it carries seven of these miracles in them.
[time=2567] The first is when he was at the wedding and he changed the water into wine.
[time=2571] The second is found in John chapter 4 and he cured the nobleman son, remember the nobleman came to him and said my son is sick and dying please come and heal him.
[time=2580] And Jesus didn't even have to go, he just said to the nobleman your son's healed, go your way and when the nobleman got home he asked and inquired as the time when his son began to recover.
[time=2588] And it was at the exact time when Jesus had said go your way.
[time=2591] Jesus healed the nobleman's son and was ready to die without even being an immediate proximity to the boy.
[time=2596] In John chapter 5 he cures the paralytic who had been paralyzed for some 38 years there in Jerusalem.
[time=2603] The pool of Bessadia he had been there hoping that someone would lift him down into the waters when they would stir but every time it would stir and it would have been a periodic healing by God the Father if the first person could get to the water there.
[time=2615] Because he was paralyzed he always got there late so he had been paralyzed for 38 years Jesus walked up to him and said arise take up your palate and walk and the man did.
[time=2624] Instantly, immediately he required no therapy, he required no coordination, required nothing.
[time=2629] He just had it because Jesus completely and totally healed the man he got up and walked away.
[time=2634] In John chapter 6 he feeds the multitudes.
[time=2637] It says there in John chapter 6 that the count was 5,000 men, 5,000 men that was just the male leadership in the group.
[time=2644] There may have been a wife and a couple of children represented by every man.
[time=2647] The group easily could have been as large as 20,000 people.
[time=2650] He had five loaves and two fish and he just started handing the stuff out and everybody ate until they were full and then they collected what was left over and had 12 basketfuls.
[time=2659] Miraculous, Jesus Christ is God.
[time=2663] Later in John chapter 6 the disciples are out on a boat on the Sea of Galilee and there's a storm brewing and they're nervous and they're a little bit frightened until they see something walking across the water and it's none other than the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2677] Despite what my mother thinks only Jesus walks on water.
[time=2681] That is a product of being deity.
[time=2684] Beyond that in John chapter 9 he gave sight to the blind, the man born blind, the man had never seen anything in his entire life.
[time=2691] There had never been a blind person healed and recorded scripture.
[time=2695] It was the unique and distinct ministry of the Messiah.
[time=2697] He saw the man spit on the ground, rubbed his hand in the clay until it became a clay type stuff, put it on his eyes, said go wash your eyes he did and he saw.
[time=2706] The man came back seeing.
[time=2708] And of course one of the more famous, maybe the most famous miracles of Jesus Christ is found in John chapter 11 when he raised his good friend Lazarus from the dead who had been dead for many days had been wrapped in his grave clothes, his burial clothes was in fact inside the tomb.
[time=2723] The stone had been rolled in its place and Jesus came to the place, removed the stone, said Lazarus come forth and his good friend came back from the dead.
[time=2731] God does that, men don't do that, God does that, and Jesus did it over and over and over and over and over again so that there was no question that in fact he was God.
[time=2746] It says at the end of the book of John that all of these signs were performed in the presence of the disciples which are not written in this book, but they were performed that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that believing in him you may have life.
[time=2760] In fact the book says, the book of John says there were so many miracles that they couldn't write them all down and there are also many other things which Jesus did which if they were written in detail I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books which could hold it.
[time=2777] Miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle to establish the fact that was so quaintly put in the manger Jesus Christ born of a virgin Jesus Christ is God.
[time=2792] Secondly he accepted worship as God and only God would. In Matthew 8 2 he heals a leper and the leper falls down and worships him and Jesus accepts it. In John 9 when he healed the man born blind the man came to Christ and fell down and worshiped him and Jesus accepted the worship.
[time=2810] In Matthew 14 33 the disciples worshiped him saying indeed thou art the Son of God. But if you come with me to John chapter 20 you'll see one of the most obvious cases when Jesus is being worshiped as God.
[time=2827] He's being worshiped by a man he had been with for three years his name was Thomas he was the doubting Thomas in verse 26 John 20 verse 26 after eight days again his disciples were inside and Thomas was with them.
[time=2841] Jesus came the doors having been shut and stood in their midst and said peace be with you.
[time=2846] Then he said to Thomas reach hear your finger and see my hands and reach hear your hand and put it into my side and be not unbelieving but believing.
[time=2854] Then Thomas answered and said to him my Lord and my God.
[time=2860] Finally he believed Jesus said to him in verse 29 because you have seen me have you believed blessed are they who did not see and yet believed.
[time=2870] Jesus accepted worship as God as a definitive statement that it was proper and right to worship him because in fact he was God.
[time=2882] Then lastly come with me to Matthew chapter 26 Christ claimed he was God in fact Christ died because he was willing to admit that he was God.
[time=2897] This is near the crucifixion Christ is being tried in Matthew 26 one of many trials that he went through.
[time=2904] He went through one with Annas one through Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin the one we have in view here later he was tried by Pilate then Pilate sent him to Herod and then Herod sent him back to Pilate.
[time=2916] And look at what is really being tried here Matthew chapter 26 verse 57 and those who had seized Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
[time=2931] Peter also was following him at a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and entered in and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.
[time=2939] Now the chief priests and the whole council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus in order that they might put him to death and they did not find any even though many false witnesses came forward.
[time=2951] So this is describing a long laborious trial in which they are trying to find fault with the person of Jesus Christ even by paying and producing false witnesses but they can't prove anything because there's no fact to their allegation.
[time=2963] But at the end of verse 60 later on two came forward and two is significant because in the Jewish court of law two witnesses were required to prove anyone guilty of anything.
[time=2972] Verse 61 they said, "This man stated, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.'
[time=2980] And the high priest stood up and said to him, 'Do you make no answer? What is it that these men are testifying against you but Jesus kept silent?'
[time=2988] And the high priest said to him, 'I adjourn you by the living God, that you tell us whether you are the Christ, the Son of God.'
[time=2997] Jesus said to him, 'You have said it yourself. Nevertheless I tell you here after you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.'
[time=3007] Then the high priest tore his robe saying, 'He has blasphemed. What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard the blasphemy. What do you think?'
[time=3018] He is now asking all there in the company to say, 'Do you think he's really God or do you think that he is blasphemed?'
[time=3025] And they answered and said, 'He is deserving of death.' In other words, no, we don't think he's God. Despite the miracles, despite his demeanor, despite his gracious self-sacrificial life, despite the fact that he spoke with authority, despite all the evidence that we've seen, we can't stand the thought that Jesus is in fact God.
[time=3046] And so when he claims to be it, we want him dead. We say he is deserving of death.
[time=3052] It's an interesting court case, isn't it? It's an interesting trial when a man is not tried on the basis of his actions, but on the basis of his identity.
[time=3061] The criminal charge laid against Christ, his confession or testimony, the interrogation of the Roman governor, the inscription on his cross at the execution, all of it centered on the one question of his identity.
[time=3075] Who are you, Jesus? Who are you?
[time=3083] And he desperately wanted them to know that he was God. Why?
[time=3087] Come back with me to Matthew chapter 9 for a minute.
[time=3091] This may be one of the more touching stories in all the Bible at the same time, one of the more aggravating.
[time=3101] Jesus in Matthew chapter 9, verse 2, so people were bringing a paralytic lying on a bed.
[time=3108] And Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic, "Take courage, my son." Now what?
[time=3113] Your sins. Your sins are forgiven.
[time=3117] Ooh, verse 3, "Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, this fellow blasphemes."
[time=3123] And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?"
[time=3129] For which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven," or say, "Rise and walk."
[time=3136] But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins, then he said to the paralytic, "Rise, take up your bed and go home."
[time=3148] And what did the paralytic do? He rose and he went home.
[time=3154] When the multitude saw this, they were filled with awe, and they glorified God who had given such authority to men.
[time=3163] There it is in a nutshell. Jesus was born of a virgin as just one more evidence that in fact he was the true and living God in the form of human flesh.
[time=3174] And then he lived a life, a perfect life, and performed all these miracles, one of which is given for us here and here, the heart of the issue.
[time=3182] Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven or rise up and walk," but in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,
[time=3191] then he stops and looks to the paralytic and says, "Take up your palate and walk. Take up your bed and go home."
[time=3198] And he clarifies for all there that he not only has the authority to say, "Get up and walk," and the man does.
[time=3205] But because that shows he's God, he also has the authority to say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[time=3212] Your sins are forgiven. There is only one way. There is only one person through whom we can find forgiveness of our sins.
[time=3221] And it is that little baby Jesus in the manger.
[time=3226] Those soft little hands fashioned by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb were made so that the nails might be driven through them.
[time=3234] Those baby feet, pink, and unable to walk would one day walk up a dusty hill to be nailed to a cross.
[time=3240] That sweet infant's head with sparkling eyes and eager mouth was formed so that some day men might force a crown of thorns upon it.
[time=3249] That tender body, warm and soft, wrapped and swaddling clothes would one day be ripped open via a sword.
[time=3258] So for some 2,000 years, the debate has been raging about who Jesus Christ really is.
[time=3266] Cults and skeptics have offered various explanations. They'll say he is one of many gods, a created being, a high angel, a good teacher, a prophet.
[time=3279] But the common thread in all of their descriptions of his identity is they strip him from being truly God.
[time=3290] So did the angels sing? It doesn't look like it. Maybe they sang in their heart.
[time=3295] I'm not going to stop singing a heartfelt angel sing. I mean, tradition is fine.
[time=3301] What about the manger scene? Should we take out the snow, put in dirty hay, remove the wise men?
[time=3308] Nah, probably not. Tradition, it's fine. Nothing wrong with it.
[time=3315] What about the magi? Were they kings? We don't know.
[time=3320] Did they come on the night of the birth of our Lord? Doesn't seem like it. They found him in a house, not the manger.
[time=3325] Were there three of them? Were there five of them? Were there ten of them? I don't know.
[time=3330] The Bible doesn't say. Should we celebrate Christmas on June 25th? Sounds horrible, doesn't it?
[time=3339] December 25th is probably fine. What's important isn't the date? It's our attitude about the date.
[time=3345] In other words, there are a whole lot of things about Christmas which really don't matter.
[time=3349] We can take them or leave them. We can enjoy them as we're going to in a few days.
[time=3354] But there is this one detail, this one profound truth that we dare not miss, that we guard for all we're worth.
[time=3364] And as Matthew puts it, now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows.
[time=3369] When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
[time=3379] And she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who will save his people from their sins.
[time=3392] And you know, frankly, the hard question, the really tough question about Christmas for me, isn't that the angels say?
[time=3401] Or what does the manger look like? Or how many magi? Or what's the date? Those aren't the tough questions about Christmas.
[time=3406] You want to know what I think is the toughest question of all about Christmas?
[time=3411] Why? Why?
[time=3422] We've been sharing Christmas music today from our living Christmas tree choir, our bins trio, and soloist Susan Toyrak and Scott Schindler.
[time=3431] The message today was from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3434] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ, and this would be a wonderful day to accept the Savior.
[time=3441] I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you. Let's bow together.
[time=3446] Our dear heavenly Father, we thank you that you sent your Savior to come to this world as a baby and then eventually to die on the cross for my sin.
[time=3455] And today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3459] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3463] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3467] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
