[time=0] what does the Bible say about the woman's role in the church?
[time=15] Should we have women pastors, women pastor teachers?
[time=18] Should we have women elders?
[time=20] That's becoming a rather popular theme in Christianity today.
[time=24] But what does the Bible say about their role?
[time=26] Stay with us this morning as we study 1 Timothy chapter 2 and find a definitive word from God's word on the role of women in the church.
[time=47] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=55] Thank you for joining us.
[time=57] Today Pastor Moore will be looking at the role of women in the church.
[time=61] As we listen to news of the world, we find that women are taking on an increasing role of leadership in the church.
[time=67] Denominations, colleges and churches are ordaining women and placing them in positions of leadership.
[time=73] Is this proper?
[time=75] Just what does the Bible have to say about this very timely issue?
[time=79] Today's message is the second in this series from 1 Timothy chapter 2.
[time=84] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study with us.
[time=88] Our special music today will include our LCT choir with a trio of Marilyn Wong, Kevin Rowe and Chris Bone.
[time=96] We are also pleased to have Stephanie Moore, sister of Pastor Moore as our special guest soloist.
[time=103] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's listen to Stephanie Moore as she sings the song entitled "Simple Gifts."
[time=127] Praise to God for simple gifts that teach my heart to know.
[time=135] The wonders of his faithfulness, the boundless love he shows.
[time=142] As we live from day to day, surrounded by his care, we come to know life's simple gifts
[time=151] that show us God is there.
[time=158] The beauty of creation, the sunshine and the rain, the brooks and hills and valleys,
[time=168] the seasons as they change, with each and every morning, it's written in the sky.
[time=178] The simple gifts of living that show us God is mine, the beauty of creation, the joy
[time=190] that's in a child, to see the children growing, the beauty of their smiles, to share a love
[time=200] that's lasting with family and friends, the simple gifts we're given bring a joy that
[time=212] never ends.
[time=215] Praise to God for Jesus Christ, the greatest gift of all, who knows a sense of love thus
[time=225] and hears us when we call.
[time=229] The simple gift of Jesus, who died of Calvary, will remain our greatest treasure throughout
[time=240] eternity.
[time=241] The simple gift of Jesus Christ, the sweetest gift of all, who knows a sense of love.
[time=264] [APPLAUSE]
[time=294] The simple gift of Jesus Christ, the greatest gift of all, who knows a sense of love.
[time=479] knows a sense of love.
[time=481] The simple gift of Jesus Christ, the greatest gift of all, who knows a sense of love.
[time=813] Thank you for tuning into the Bible Hour today.
[time=831] You have the last memories of the living Christmas tree and the music of Christmas.
[time=836] We've had a number of things to reflect on because of God's goodness during this Christmas time.
[time=842] Also we had a number of people that came to the Christmas tree and were really grateful for all of those that came and celebrated with us.
[time=849] Each night you had a great message and part of that message was a little story about a train that you talked about that you were going to give to your dad.
[time=857] I've been waiting anxiously to find out, "All right, what's the result of that gift being given to your dad?
[time=863] Tell us about it." Thank you Peter.
[time=865] As you know, my dad and I had a train when we were growing up when I was growing up and we had somehow lost that train, it had been given to some nephews and we got it back and got it refurbished and I was able to give it to him this Christmas very unexpectedly.
[time=877] I think it really meant a lot to him.
[time=879] He called me about 2.30 my time in the morning on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and it was
[time=886] obvious that he'd been choked up because it kind of taken him by surprise and it was something that meant a lot to him.
[time=891] We've talked several times since and he's been playing with it regularly so he's young at heart and I think that that train really symbolizes a lot of things that went on in our relationship.
[time=901] Kind of reminds us again of what giving really is and it isn't really always monetary, how
[time=907] much we spend on a particular gift but the importance of the impact and all that that gift carries and I know it carried a lot of your love for your parents in spite of the fact that there are so many miles away that was a very, very super gift for them and I'm sure they really enjoyed that.
[time=923] And Russ, this was an opportunity with the tree to, I know a lot of, we didn't get to talk to a lot of the people but I know there are a lot of Bible viewers who are at the Living Christmas Tree and we just want to thank you for coming.
[time=935] That was great to see all the people here wasn't it?
[time=938] It was amazing to see that auditorium fill up I guess 10 times in a row, some 20,000 people and just sharing the excitement of Christmas with them.
[time=946] They bring all their energy to us and we give ours to them and it's kind of explosive.
[time=950] I was amazed, it was exciting.
[time=952] I really hope that it was a real wonderful experience for you so that it could help you
[time=958] through the Christmas season and then through this entire year.
[time=961] Speaking of the beginning of a new year, this is often for people the time of New Year's resolutions.
[time=967] Also this would be a good time just to tell everyone to make a resolution that they would come to church.
[time=973] Many people don't attend church regularly and we'll just give you a special invitation if you don't attend a church regularly to come to Black Hawk Baptist Church and join with us.
[time=983] And you'll be encouraged by the messages and the music and it'll be a point of inspiration for you weekly that all of us need.
[time=989] I hope that you'll just take the time to join with us and make it a regular part of your lives to bring your family and worship together with us here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1000] We've been talking about a calendar, it's called the Daily Walk Bible Calendar that we offer to you.
[time=1006] We hope that you can write for it and get it right away because the calendar offers an opportunity for you to read a verse a day.
[time=1014] This is the thought for that day that reflects on the verse that you read and then there's a wonderful plan to help you read through the entire Bible in the year 1992.
[time=1023] This Daily Walk Bible Calendar is available to you absolutely free if you'll just write to us today.
[time=1029] Please write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code
[time=1035] is 46815.
[time=1038] Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code
[time=1044] is 46815.
[time=1046] Also we have another pleasant surprise today, your sister is visiting and she's seen just
[time=1053] a few moments of I'm delighted to have the opportunity to hear and I know you're excited about her being here in Indiana.
[time=1058] Well we're thankful she's here.
[time=1059] She came in Christmas Day and has stayed through with us until after New Year's and she brings so much energy and so much joy to our home.
[time=1066] My daughters love being with Aunt Stephanie and so we've been really rejoicing together in her visit.
[time=1072] I hope that you'll stay tuned with us, Stephanie will be singing just a moment and then we'll have the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=1078] Stay tuned to the Bible Hour and I hope it'll be a source of inspiration for you on this very day.
[time=1096] As I look back on the road I've traveled, I see so many times he carried me through.
[time=1116] If there's one thing that I've learned in my life, my redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1130] My redeemer is faithful and true, everything he has said he will do.
[time=1144] And every morning his verses are new, my redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1160] My heart rejoices when I read the promise, there is a place I am preparing for you.
[time=1178] Someday I know I'll see my Lord face to face, my redeemer is faithful and true, my redeemer
[time=1193] is faithful and true, everything he has said he will do.
[time=1207] My redeemer is faithful and true, and in every situation he has proved his love for me.
[time=1227] When I lack the understanding he gives more grace to me, my redeemer is faithful and true,
[time=1243] everything he has said he will do, and every morning his verses are new.
[time=1258] My redeemer is faithful and true, my redeemer is faithful and true.
[time=1288] Amen, thank you, Stephanie, to joy to know the person that's singing as well as I know
[time=1300] my sister and to realize that not only has the redeemer been faithful and true, but that your life has been faithful and true to your redeemer.
[time=1311] I'll invite you this morning to take your Bibles and open again to 1 Timothy chapter 2, we're studying the book of Timothy together.
[time=1320] We took last Sunday off to have a special message about the Christ of Christmas, but we come back to it this morning and in returning to this book we come back to a passage which is very controversial in Christianity today.
[time=1333] I've asked you to be praying for your pastor as he tries to make his way through this land
[time=1339] mine or land field, if you will, it's like walking into a room full of dynamite with a
[time=1345] match that's been lit.
[time=1347] Hope I don't blow us all up today.
[time=1350] It's the passage in verses 9 through 15 and it involves the woman's role in the church.
[time=1356] We've studied it, we began it two weeks ago, consider the first two verses, we'll look at another two of them today and trust that God will give us wisdom and insight into his
[time=1366] plan for the role of women in the church.
[time=1368] Let me read the passage so we can set it in our minds.
[time=1371] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly,
[time=1378] not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, but rather by means of good works as befits women making a claim to godliness.
[time=1387] Let a woman quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness.
[time=1392] But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man but to remain quiet.
[time=1398] Before it was Adam who was first created and then Eve and it was not Adam who was deceived but the woman being quite deceived fell into transgression.
[time=1407] But women shall be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
[time=1415] This passage is for many an emotionally charged passage and we bristle even in its reading
[time=1421] because it is so contradictory to what the world is telling us about the role of women and the place of women.
[time=1429] We have looked last time at their attire in verse 9.
[time=1432] He says that I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing and the word adorn in the Greek is the word cosmeto from which we get our English word cosmetic and it is very normal and it is natural and it is healthy and it is right and it is to be expected and honored in women that they should adorn themselves, that they should prepare themselves, put themselves in order to arrange themselves to come to church and really that is the thing that is in view here is how we come to church and we know that because over in chapter 3 verse 15 he is saying that I am giving you this instruction so that you may know how one
[time=1466] ought to conduct himself and the household of God.
[time=1469] This is a whole series of different instructions to the people as they congregate on Sunday morning for worship.
[time=1476] What he begins by saying is that their attire is to be neat and orderly but it is not to be characteristic of braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments and as we looked at that last time we understood that in that day and age women would take their jewels and their wealth and wrap it up in their hair, pearls and that day being three times more valuable than gold and they could put a literal fortune in their hair and the problem here was that they came and distracted the other people from worshiping God.
[time=1506] The real underlying theme here is who are we going to worship on Sunday morning.
[time=1510] The women and their beautiful attire or the living God who we have come to seek forgiveness from and to pay homage to and honor and glorify in our congregation.
[time=1520] There is nothing wrong with a woman adorning herself, that is right, that is proper, that needs to be and we as men need to respect that but the woman has the very difficult task of balancing all that it means to be a woman and adorning herself and yet in her heart not going beyond that to where she is actually trying to draw attention to herself.
[time=1539] So in some way to display the beauty of womanhood and yet not become a distraction that is difficult and we pray for guidance in our wives lives and the women of our church as they so faithfully
[time=1550] pursue that high goal in calling.
[time=1553] Their attitude is described also in verse 9 in these two little words modestly and discreetly.
[time=1560] And as we remember the word modesty combines the whole idea of modesty and genuine humility with a touch of shame, not shame at being a woman and not shame at even being a beautiful
[time=1571] woman.
[time=1572] The idea of shame here is found in the heart of a godly woman that she would do anything in her dress, in her appearance, in her mannerisms that would cause a man to lust after her.
[time=1581] She is modest, it is shameful in her heart to think that she would produce lustful thoughts
[time=1587] in another person.
[time=1588] As a result of that attitude she dresses commensurately.
[time=1592] Personality is the other word and it is another word for self-control or self-mastery.
[time=1597] And the word in secular usage, the Greek word in that time was used often to describe the
[time=1603] self-mastery of the passions that women are to have themselves under control in the sensual
[time=1610] passions of their life and not to dress in such a way as to excite or to arouse lust in men and try to engage them in illicit sexual activity.
[time=1620] And that, by the way, was constantly happening at the church at Ephesus, the church where Paul is writing to, the temple diana, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world dominated the city of Ephesus and the temple prostitutes dressed in just this way and had this very objective in their mind and in their hearts as they went out onto the street to sell themselves in what they called religious practice.
[time=1642] And Paul says that the women of Christ, the women who are truly born again, should not adorn themselves in that way, but then look at verse ten, beyond even the physical or
[time=1652] material adornment, they should by means of good works as befits women making a claim
[time=1658] to godliness.
[time=1659] They should be noted not primarily because of their dress, but because of the behavior of their life, their godly good works.
[time=1667] That should mark them.
[time=1670] So all of that, by way of review, we come this morning now to their role.
[time=1674] The attire of women, the attitude of women, and the role of women in the church, verses 11 and 12.
[time=1681] And as I've said, this is where the debate really heats up.
[time=1686] This is where things really start to boil and it's over the question of women being ordained into the ministry.
[time=1693] Women going to seminary to learn how to preach and teach the word of God and then taking a place such as mine or one of the other pastors on staff at this church whose primary responsibility
[time=1704] is to preach and teach and proclaim the word of God.
[time=1708] The traditional view of this passage throughout the centuries of the Christian church has been that women are not to be ordained into Christian ministry and therefore not to be pastors and
[time=1718] teachers and elders and overseers and the church.
[time=1722] Over and against that traditional view, there is what is known as the egalitarian view and
[time=1728] it has taken a radical departure from the traditional understanding of this passage in
[time=1734] that it fully supports females for ordination in ministry and proposes that women should be able to engage in any kind of Christian ministry for which they feel the Holy Spirit has gifted them.
[time=1745] And if that means ordination, if that means becoming a pastor or a teacher or an elder, if that means becoming a seminary professor, in fact training up the people who will do the preaching, if in fact that means becoming even the president or the primary leader of a seminary or a college that is designed to train men for ministry, so be it.
[time=1765] So be it.
[time=1766] That would be their role.
[time=1767] And of course that view of this scripture is very much in keeping with the cultural flow
[time=1773] of our day with women's rights and their rights to assume leadership and various kinds of secular organizations and corporations.
[time=1780] Now the question is this, why is it that ordination to full-time ministry is the issue that flows
[time=1788] out of this particular text?
[time=1790] The word ordination is nowhere used in this entire four or five verses, verses nine to fifteen.
[time=1796] You won't find the word ordination.
[time=1797] Why is that the battleground?
[time=1800] There is no mention of who would do the wedding ceremonies or who would conduct the funerals or some of the other traditional roles of pastors.
[time=1807] I mean, why is it that ordination is the thing that is so much in focus here?
[time=1812] The answer to that is really very clear.
[time=1815] If you look at verse 12, he says, "I do not allow women to teach or to exercise authority."
[time=1821] This concept or this function or this role of teaching the word of God and through that
[time=1827] teaching, exercising authority is why the ordination debate flows out of this passage
[time=1833] because that is the primary role, teaching and through the teaching, exercising doctrinal authority that has been given to men in the ministry, that has been given to elders, that has been given to shepherds or pastors.
[time=1847] It is true that leadership in the Bible has many characteristics which all of us must
[time=1854] embrace.
[time=1855] All of us must be servants one of another.
[time=1857] The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life a ransom for many.
[time=1862] In other words, Christ shows us that real leadership is giving your life away, giving self-sacrificially, and all of us are called to that high standard.
[time=1872] It's also true that true biblical leadership is one of love, one of really being interested in the other person's benefit, not holding a position or a title for your own benefit or for what you can gain out of it, but you hold that position because you are hoping in that way to express your love and your ministry to other people.
[time=1890] It is also true that all of us are having the responsibility to confront one another when we fall into a various trespass as Galatians 6-1 and following says, "That is not just
[time=1900] given to the leadership; it is indeed given to the whole church and everybody in the church." So many of the responsibilities that are traditionally tied to biblical leadership are really to
[time=1910] be embraced by all of us as believers, as we function as a normal, healthy church.
[time=1916] And that would be true to one degree or another, even of teaching.
[time=1919] We are all to be teaching.
[time=1921] We are all to be sharing the good news, older men teaching younger men in the form of discipleship.
[time=1927] The Bible talks about the older women teaching the younger women.
[time=1930] Parents are instructed to teach their children and even we who are saved are called to teach the unsaved that they might come to the knowledge of the truth.
[time=1939] So what this text isn't saying is that nobody is supposed to teach anything about Christianity
[time=1945] except the pastor-teacher or the elder.
[time=1948] It's not what's in view here.
[time=1949] We all have various teaching assignments and teaching responsibilities.
[time=1953] What he is saying is that when the church congregates such as it is doing this morning, when the assembly comes together, he is saying that the responsibility of teaching the Word of God and through that exercising the authority of the Word of God is a responsibility that has been given to the men, not the women.
[time=1973] And I want to take a minute this morning and the message today is a little bit more teachy than preachy and I'm going to ask you to be patient with me today.
[time=1981] And when we hit passages like this, we really need to dig into the Word of God and I will try to be faithful to give you a broad understanding of the teaching and exercising of authority
[time=1992] and who is supposed to do that and who is not supposed to do that and why.
[time=1995] But as a result, we'll be with our noses in the book a little bit more, we'll be turning from passage to passage, I trust you'll keep up with me.
[time=2002] I really want you to hold these convictions in your own heart because you've seen them in the Word of God, not because I stood up here and said it was so.
[time=2010] So turn with me if you will to Acts, Acts chapter 20 and we'll find a clear definition of teaching
[time=2019] and exercising authority in the church that that responsibility was first modeled by the
[time=2025] Apostle Paul and then given to the elders of the church.
[time=2030] The church in view here is the church at Ephesus, the very church at which Timothy was ministering at this time, Acts chapter 20 verse 17.
[time=2040] And from Myletus, Paul was on the island of Myletus, he sent to Ephesus, that city across the bay, and called to him the elders of the church.
[time=2049] He now has the leadership of the church with him and he begins to talk about his ministry with him, I want you to skip through some of that to verse 27.
[time=2058] He says, "I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole purpose of God." In other words, my ministry among you primarily was to teach and preach the Word of God, now verse 28, "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among which the Holy Spirit
[time=2074] has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood."
[time=2080] Why?
[time=2081] Verse 29, "I know that after My departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock and from among your own selves, men will arise, speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them; therefore, be on the alert, remembering that night and
[time=2096] day, for a period of three years, I did not cease to admonish each one with tears."
[time=2102] This is his last encounter with the elders of Ephesus.
[time=2105] You remember, he spent three and a half years in the city of Ephesus, giving birth to this church and teaching it the Word of God.
[time=2111] He says, "I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole council of God.
[time=2114] I am now on my way to Jerusalem.
[time=2116] I may never see you again." And so he pulls the elders of that church, the leadership of that church aside to the island of Miletus and says, "Now listen, men, this is your responsibility to guard the doctrine, to teach the doctrine, to be aware that men will come into your assembly, both from outside your church and inside your church, and they will try to pollute and degrade and
[time=2137] work against the true doctrine which I have given you.
[time=2140] Don't let that happen.
[time=2141] That is your responsibility." And then he says in verse 31, "To be alert, remembering that night and day, for a period of three years, I did not cease to admonish each one with tears." And this word admonish, excuse me, admonish, could have been translated to instruct or to warn.
[time=2158] And it has the idea of these elders, these bishops, these overseers, being able to see
[time=2164] the false doctrine that is encroaching on the church and standing up and declaratively teaching the Word of God against that false heresy, against that false truth, and in that warning the family that what those men are saying is not true, to warn them of the damnation
[time=2180] that would come to them if they were to believe that false gospel and false doctrine, and then to call the people back to the true and faithful apostolic doctrine which Paul had delivered to them in his ministry there.
[time=2193] So clearly as we begin in the book of Acts, the pattern is for the responsibility of teaching and exercising doctrinal authority to reside in the hands of the male leadership.
[time=2205] Come with me now to Ephesians.
[time=2208] The book of Ephesians.
[time=2209] Again, this is the same group of believers to whom Paul was writing in 1 Timothy.
[time=2214] Ephesians chapter 4.
[time=2222] Ephesians chapter 4, and we're going to look at verses 11, 12, and 13, and again I hope you'll see that the principle primary ministry of the elders, of the pastor-teachers is that
[time=2233] of teaching the Word of God.
[time=2236] He is in this passage talking about spiritual gifts.
[time=2238] You can see that alluded to in verse 7, but to each one of us, grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gifts.
[time=2246] At the point of salvation, each one of us receives spiritual gifts, endowments for ministry.
[time=2252] And he's talking about now how do we bring those gifts for ministry into fruition so that the church is strong and healthy and vibrant and growing.
[time=2261] And he gives that explanation in verses 11 and 12.
[time=2265] Christ gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=2272] Why?
[time=2273] Verse 12, "For the equipping of the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith and it goes on." In other words, what is the formula for church growth?
[time=2283] How is the church supposed to grow and become strong?
[time=2286] And by growth, I don't mean numerically.
[time=2288] I don't mean how can we get as many people in this building as we possibly can.
[time=2291] What he was talking about here is how do we mature the saints?
[time=2295] How do we take the people that God has given us and grow them up in the conformity with Jesus Christ?
[time=2300] He says, "First I've given gifts at large to the family and they can minister those one to another." But they must do that in a doctrinal framework or in a doctrinal atmosphere of truth that
[time=2312] is declared by the evangelist and now, particularly look at verse 11 again at the very end, "pastors and teachers." That word "and" is a conjunction and it can mean that is or more specifically or what
[time=2326] I mean by that.
[time=2328] And what he's saying here is that the church is matured as the pastor teaches.
[time=2333] So dominant a theme is the teaching in the ministry of the pastor that he is called as one office a pastor teacher.
[time=2341] It's not that we have a pastor over here who kind of shepherds and has a soft heart and that over here we have a teacher that comes in and is kind of academic and he teaches.
[time=2349] Paul's saying no, it's not two offices, it's one, your pastor is your teacher.
[time=2354] The responsibility of your pastor is to declare the truth and the doctrine and establish this doctrinal environment for the entire church to function within the truth of God.
[time=2364] Now you see this lived out in Paul's life.
[time=2366] You don't have to turn there, I'll read it to you.
[time=2368] But over in 1 Corinthians chapter 4, you remember that church at Corinth was in all kinds of trouble, they were full of division, there was all kinds of schism going on and one man was saying I am a Paulist, I am a Paul, I am of Christ, there was no love, there was an inordinate emphasis upon the sign gifts.
[time=2386] There was incest in the church, there was carnality, there were Christian brothers taking each other before the heathen courts instead of settling that matter outside of the court.
[time=2396] And in 1 Corinthians 4, 14 Paul says this, "I do not write these things to shame you but
[time=2402] to admonish you as my beloved children." So the role that he had there was not only to proclaim the doctrine but then to specifically apply it to people's lives who were violating the truth of the Word of God.
[time=2417] In the church at Colossae, a church in the near vicinity of the church at Ephesus, they were also struggling with false doctrine.
[time=2424] It was a weird kind of fusing of Jewish legalism and Greek philosophy and the Oriental mysticism
[time=2430] and they were trying to bring all this together and in the process they were really detracting from the sufficiency of Christ in our Christian lives.
[time=2437] And Paul says that we have come and proclaimed him admonishing every man and teaching every
[time=2443] man with all wisdom that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[time=2447] And so you understand that this teaching and exercising authority is really the function
[time=2453] of teaching the Word of God, declaring the doctrine and applying it to people's life through that declarative teaching.
[time=2461] The authority that these men had, Paul and that others who followed them and now pastors
[time=2467] and teachers and elders, it's not a kind of authority that says you've joined our church and now we'll say what you do with your private property and we'll say how much money you
[time=2477] should live on and what your standard of living is going to be and we'll arrange the marriages and we'll establish everybody's giving amounts.
[time=2484] That is absolutely totally removed, that's not the kind of authority at all that the Bible gives to pastors and teachers.
[time=2490] That's none of my business, that's none of any pastor's business.
[time=2493] The teaching and the authority and view here is the clear presentation of what God has said declaring it over and against false doctrine and blatant sin and seeing the people respond
[time=2505] to that and repent to that and live in conformity to the Word of God.
[time=2510] That responsibility has been given to the men.
[time=2515] Turn now to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and I'll continue to develop my line of reasoning with you on this thought.
[time=2522] 1 Thessalonians chapter 5, here he writes to yet another church.
[time=2528] We've heard his words to the church at Ephesus, to the church at Colossae, now a different church, the church at Thessalonica, chapter 5 verses 12 and following.
[time=2538] But we request of you brethren that you appreciate those who diligently labor among you and have
[time=2544] charge over you and the Lord and give you instruction.
[time=2548] Right there you can see that the responsibility, the charge that they have been given over the flock of God is bound up with the giving of their instruction and that the flock is
[time=2558] to appreciate them for that, to be responsive to that.
[time=2561] Look at verse 13, that you may esteem them very highly in love because of their work, and I'll add, understanding that their ministry to you is to make sure that you're not deceived
[time=2572] by false doctrine and false prophets that are sown as lies of Satan that would take you off to destruction.
[time=2578] So appreciate them for that.
[time=2580] How much should we appreciate them?
[time=2582] Look at verse 14.
[time=2584] And we urge you brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all men.
[time=2591] In other words, appreciate so much the instruction and the teaching that they give you that you understand it and learn it and begin to apply it to each other's lives in all the network
[time=2601] of relationships that fills a church such as ours.
[time=2604] You know each other far better than I know you or could ever know all of you.
[time=2608] I mean, we have pockets of real significant relationships in a church and that's true in any church.
[time=2613] And when God gives these pastors and these teachers to declare the truth of God and to establish the doctrinal parameters, it's then incumbent upon the people to so receive that that they begin to, as it says in verse 14, admonish one another, encourage one another,
[time=2628] help the weak and be patient with all men.
[time=2631] That is the pattern.
[time=2632] That is the New Testament pattern for the church and how it is to function.
[time=2642] Now come with me to 1 Timothy chapter 5.
[time=2648] You'll see that again reinforced, 1 Timothy chapter 5 verse 17.
[time=2659] It says here, 1 Timothy 5, 17, let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double
[time=2666] honor, especially those who work hard at what?
[time=2670] At preaching and teaching.
[time=2673] So what Paul is saying here is that to the elders has been given the responsibility to rule.
[time=2679] What does that mean to again establish the doctrinal parameters of the church and those elders among you who are working doubly hard or who are working themselves, actually the Greek word means to the point of exhaustion at preaching and teaching those you should give double honor to for they are at the heart and center of their ministry, of their responsibility
[time=2698] to preach and teach the word of God.
[time=2702] Come back to another passage, Titus chapter 1, and I told you you'd use your Bibles this morning, so here we go, Titus chapter 1 and you'll see again the responsibility of elders
[time=2717] to be consumed with sound doctrine.
[time=2722] You can look at verse 5, it's kind of the thesis statement of this paragraph, for this reason I left you in Crete that you might set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you.
[time=2733] Now they go on to talk about these elders, a man of above approach in verse 6, a husband of one wife having children who believe not accused of dissipation or rebellion, for the
[time=2743] overseer must be above approach as God's steward not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain, but hospitable loving what is good, sensible, just about self-control.
[time=2754] Now all of those really are his character, that really says nothing about his skill in ministry, that's just who the man is, which by the way is very, very important, but look at his ministry skill, what is his task, verse 9, holding fast the faithful word which
[time=2770] is in accordance with the teaching that he may be able both to exhort in sound doctrine
[time=2776] and to refute those who contradict, there's his ministry, there's his primary responsibility,
[time=2783] he has to be a man of the word who is committed to teaching the word of God so that he can exhort in sound doctrine, that means within the church, exhorting the believers onto obedience and encouraging them to follow the law of God and at the same time refute anyone who
[time=2799] contradicts that sound doctrine.
[time=2801] A church without sound doctrine is a church with shaky ground, it is not a church to be
[time=2808] a part of, a church that has good, solid, biblical doctrine is the place to begin in
[time=2814] growing your spiritual life and that is the responsibility of the elders who have been given charge of the flock to continue to declare it faithfully from God's word and establish it in the minds of the people, which they then take it themselves and work it into each other's lives as the rubber meets the road in the network of relationships.
[time=2833] One more passage, if you'll indulge me, 1 Peter chapter 5 and this would be the last major instruction in all of the New Testament about elders and about teaching and exercising
[time=2844] authority.
[time=2846] First Peter chapter 5, "Therefore," he says, verse 1, "I exhort the elders among you as
[time=2854] your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed." Verse 2, "Shepherd the flock of God, exercising oversight not under compulsion but voluntarily
[time=2867] according to the will of God and not for money, not for sordid gain, but with eagerness." Verse 3, "Nor yet as loarding it over those who are allotted to your charge but proving to be examples to the flock." And here he contradicts what was then and is even today a typical pattern of worldly
[time=2886] leadership where the position is held for the sake of money and when they hold that position they lord their responsibility over those who have been given to their charge and it's somewhat removed and obtuse at times and they just dictate what should be done.
[time=2899] Out of that kind, that is not the kind of oversight that God wants for his church.
[time=2902] These elders must be men who are humble of heart, who are in the ministry not for money but out of eagerness and delight to see people grow up in the likeness of Christ, who do not lord their responsibility but instead prove themselves to be examples and what it means is they put themselves under the same accountability of the word of God to live a godly and a righteous life as best they can.
[time=2925] They live the truth they teach.
[time=2929] That is the responsibility of elders in the church.
[time=2933] Now let me say it to you another way.
[time=2937] Again when you come to a controversial passage such as this one, it helps to back up from the passage itself and say, "Well, how does that square, how does the traditional view of this passage square with the rest of Scripture?" In other words, with the whole counsel of God, I mean is this passage like out of whack with the rest of what God has said and done throughout history.
[time=2959] And I would suggest to you it is completely consistent with the way that God has moved the kingdom of God throughout redemptive history.
[time=2967] What do I mean by that?
[time=2968] Well listen and think with me for a minute, do you realize that there is not one woman ever named as a king of Israel, justly?
[time=2976] One usurped the throne but there was no legitimate female king in all of Israel's history, either of Judah or Israel?
[time=2984] You realize that there was not one woman priest recorded anywhere in the entire Old Testament?
[time=2990] There has not been one woman who wrote any portion of any book of the Old Testament.
[time=2996] All 39 books were written by men, though two books are named after women Ruth and Esther.
[time=3002] Nevertheless, all the books of the Old Testament and every portion in them was written by men.
[time=3009] It's also interesting to note that there was no ongoing prophetic ministry by any woman in the Old Testament.
[time=3015] There are no minor prophets that are women.
[time=3020] You say, well what about the prophetesses of the Old Testament?
[time=3022] And I will grant you, there are five.
[time=3024] Let me describe to you their ministry.
[time=3026] The first is Miriam in Exodus 15.
[time=3028] She is the sister of Moses.
[time=3030] She is called a prophetess because and only because she on one occasion led the women of Israel in a great hymn of praise with temporal and dance wherein God gave her a very brief
[time=3042] revelation to speak.
[time=3043] She spoke it and she was done.
[time=3045] The Bible never records her on any other occasion as having given a prophetic message and she has no ongoing prophetic ministry.
[time=3053] The second prophetess in the Old Testament is Deborah, Judges chapter 4 verse 4.
[time=3058] She is noted as a prophetess because she was used by God to give a direct revelation from God to a man by the name of Barak who was hindering in the battle and he was asking for some extra confirmation from God.
[time=3069] And God gave her a revelation.
[time=3071] She spoke it to him.
[time=3073] As with Miriam, Deborah never spoke another prophetic message in all of recorded history, biblical history.
[time=3080] Halda is the third prophetess in 2 Kings 22, 14.
[time=3084] She is called a prophetess because she was given a revelation to be given to a priest about the coming judgment of Jerusalem and Judah.
[time=3091] She gave it and was done, no ongoing prophetic ministry.
[time=3095] Noadia in Nehemiah 6, 14 is also called a prophetess but she is called a false prophetess
[time=3101] because she was in opposition to the rebuilding of the wall which Nehemiah had been commissioned to do.
[time=3106] The fifth and final prophetess of the Old Testament is the wife of Isaiah, Isaiah 8 verse 3 so
[time=3113] called because she gave birth to a child whose name had prophetic meaning.
[time=3118] She never spoke a prophecy and is called a prophetess only in that sense.
[time=3124] So as we look through the Old Testament record for women in leadership, for women in the
[time=3130] authoritative role of proclaiming doctrine or God's truth or the prophetic message and in that exercising authority over the people of God in the nation of Israel, we are want to find them.
[time=3140] They are not there in that role.
[time=3142] They played many significant roles and they were enormously valuable to what God was doing and we can think of some of the names of the women that come to our mind but they were not holding the position of teaching and exercising authority in leadership.
[time=3155] And the same can be said of the New Testament.
[time=3157] There is no woman preacher recorded anywhere in the New Testament.
[time=3160] There is no woman pastor teacher, no woman elder, overseer, shepherd, evangelist.
[time=3166] There is no portion of the New Testament that was written by a woman and nowhere in all of the New Testament is there recorded a sermon or a portion of a sermon preached by a woman.
[time=3175] You say, well what about the four daughters of Philip in Acts 21 verse 9?
[time=3181] And there you'll find Paul in Caesarea.
[time=3183] He has entered the man's house by the name of Philip.
[time=3186] He had four daughters and they were called prophetesses.
[time=3189] They do not prophesy there.
[time=3191] We know of no prophecy they made.
[time=3192] They're not called prophets or evangelists or elders.
[time=3195] They have no ongoing ministry.
[time=3197] In fact, when Paul does receive a message from God while he is in the very house of Philip, it comes to him to him through a man by the name of Agabus.
[time=3206] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from our Living Christmas Tree Choir and our special guest, Stephanie Moore, from Valencia, California.
[time=3214] The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3218] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3222] I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer of repentance with you.
[time=3226] Would you bow and pray with me?
[time=3229] My Father, we thank you that you sent the Savior to be born in this world and also to
[time=3235] die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3236] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3240] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3244] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3249] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3253] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3261] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or a copy of the daily walk calendar, please write to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3274] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape #1532 or mention the
[time=3280] sermon by Pastor Moore entitled "Women in the Church," Part 2.
[time=3284] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3291] Well, as 1991 comes to an end, we will want to pause and say thank you to you for your
[time=3300] participation with us in the Bible Hour, it's been an exciting year and we've seen God do some amazing things.
[time=3306] I know I've seen that in my own life as He has moved me from California to Fort Wayne and when giving me the privilege and the opportunity of being a part of this ministry and having in some way a small part in your life.
[time=3316] I trust that you've seen God work mindily in your life as well and possibly through the music and through the preaching and teaching of God's Word and this ministry, you've learned some things about your God and how He would have you to live your life.
[time=3329] I know I'm thankful for the great number of volunteer staff that so faithfully help us
[time=3335] each and every week.
[time=3336] They come early before church, they stay late after church and their dedication and commitment is really exemplary in our Christian life as we watch these people from all different walks of life volunteer their time and their talent to bring the Bible Hour to you.
[time=3349] We'd like you to be able to see them and say thank you to them as well.
[time=3359] [MUSIC - 88 seconds]
[time=3458] Well that's our team and we're again thankful that you're really a part of our team as well and we pray that God will encourage and strengthen you in the inner man as you anticipate 1992.
[time=3468] We really don't know the challenges that await us in our Christian lives but we trust that in our relationship with Jesus Christ we'll find the resources to live a godly life for His glory.
[time=3479] God bless you. Happy New Year.
