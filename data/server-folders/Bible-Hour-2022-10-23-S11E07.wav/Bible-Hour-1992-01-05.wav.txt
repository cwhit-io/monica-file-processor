[time=0] Are men and women really the same?
[time=4] Is there really a unisex where the only significant difference between men and women is a biological
[time=10] one?
[time=11] Or are they different?
[time=13] Are they created differently by God in such a way that they are uniquely equipped for different responsibilities within the church?
[time=22] Well stay with us this morning as we probe God's word for answers to these significant moments.
[time=39] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=46] Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] Today Pastor Moore will be continuing his series on the role of women in the church.
[time=54] Does the Bible make a distinction between the roles of men and women in the church?
[time=58] Is there a difference in the levels of their spiritual potential?
[time=61] We encourage you to open your Bible, open your mind, and listen to what God's word has to say about this very timely issue.
[time=70] Today's message is third in this series from 1 Timothy chapter 2.
[time=74] Our special music today will include Carrie Johnson singing, Friends in High Places, and
[time=81] Peter Coby singing, Proclaim the Glory of the Lord.
[time=85] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's listen and meditate with the Sanctuary Choir in Orchestra as they call us to worship with the song entitled, Oh We Worship.
[time=111] We are young in this house to celebrate his name, to tell him we're happy, so happy
[time=136] We know where they were named by the Holy Day, we stand here as trophies of his power to
[time=153] sing, Oh We Worship, Oh We Worship, We Worship, Jesus the Lord of all who have magnified
[time=174] Him, and Lord of all who have magnified Him, Jesus, the Lord of all who have magnified
[time=190] Him.
[time=191] We are sheep of his pasture, he knows us by name, and we're sure that he loves us by
[time=204] Jesus, each one just the same, and we all need to see Him in wah-woo, and awe, and
[time=219] it seems as we praise Him, His Lord is inside, Oh We Worship, Oh We Worship, We Worship,
[time=239] Jesus the Lord of all who have magnified Him, and Lord of all who have magnified Him,
[time=255] Oh We Worship, We Worship, We Worship, We Worship, We Worship, We Worship, We Worship,
[time=278] [MUSIC - 30 seconds]
[time=313] (applause)
[time=322] - A privilege to come here and to worship our sweet Lord.
[time=326] The great Tim, we sing so often here with great power and conviction.
[time=330] Number four, How great thou art will sing verses one, three, and four.
[time=334] How great thou art.
[time=338] [MUSIC - 168 seconds]
[time=512] - Amen, thank you for your good singing.
[time=516] I appreciate that very much.
[time=518] Gary Johnson's gonna come now.
[time=519] We've sung some songs that were written a number of years ago and we are singing and listening to a song now that's been recently written, talking about friends in high places.
[time=530] We've talked about Jesus, our Savior, our Redeemer, and our Lord.
[time=534] He's our dear friend in Shepherd too.
[time=536] He's not very far away when we have the Holy Spirit in our hearts to commune with Him.
[time=541] Listen to her message and song as she sings for us right now.
[time=544] (gentle music)
[time=560] [MUSIC - 5 seconds]
[time=574] (gentle music)
[time=589] [MUSIC - 214 seconds]
[time=806] - Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=818] We're so glad that you've tuned in.
[time=820] I hope that the recent holiday messages and the theme of the Savior's birth was refreshing to you.
[time=828] We're back to normality here at Black Walk Baptist Church with a living Christmas tree down and put away and our platform back to normal.
[time=837] We're so thankful for those of you that responded to our year end letter and sent gifts supporting the Bible Hour.
[time=845] Certainly we do not like to ask for money but it does cost to be on television.
[time=851] And we're so thankful for those of you that when we ask you know that we're sincere in our asking and you are supportive of the Bible Hour.
[time=858] We thank you very much for that and in particular those that are in the Founders Club.
[time=862] It's a great way to get the gospel spread throughout our community and we're grateful for your support.
[time=869] And also this has been a time when we talked even last week about resolutions and beginning the new year with a great commitment.
[time=875] And I invited them to come to church on a regular basis if they're watching the Bible Hour.
[time=880] I think it's a great idea and a great resolution.
[time=882] You know I couldn't agree with you more.
[time=883] I think that if you don't have a church, if you don't have a home church where you identify yourself and minister your spiritual gifts you need to have one.
[time=892] That's just normative and New Testament thought and teaching.
[time=896] And you didn't know I was gonna do this but I'll encourage you further by saying that if you do start coming to church in the evening messages I'm gonna start a survey of the Old Testament.
[time=905] And a lot of times people will make the New Year's resolution to read through the Bible in a year and this would be a great time to start that 'cause I'm gonna give you in about four, five, six, seven weeks and overview of the Old Testament, give you some benchmarks as you'll read through it and really an understanding of why God has done what He has done in the Old Testament.
[time=922] So that'll be a double encouragement to come.
[time=925] - Well, as you've already told us about extra things that happened beyond the Sunday morning service here at Blackhawk, there are so many children's programs and Bible studies for men and women and activities for our young people.
[time=937] So it's a great opportunity for families to get involved this beginning of the New Year right here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=943] I hope they come.
[time=944] We're also here in a very unique series of messages and I know that the people are interested about this subject and what the Bible has to say about it.
[time=954] - Well, we're talking about women, women and their role in the church and we're being very challenged by a passage of scripture that is comprehensive and thorough and it's treatment of how women are to respond in the church.
[time=966] And I know that our message got a little short last week or cut off a little quickly because we had some extra stuff at the end of our Bible hour, kind of our end of the year farewell.
[time=974] And I just wanted you to know that we did finish up the message by establishing that this teaching and exercising of authority role that God has has really been given to men and elders and overseers and shepherds and not to women.
[time=989] The role that God has given to women in the church is that of a learner to be discipled, to be trained and instructed in the word of God, which in Paul's day really wasn't happening.
[time=998] The women had been relegated to a subordinate role in the church and we're really being looked upon with disdain and not given the opportunity to teach and to be taught or to be instructed in the word of God.
[time=1011] And Paul says, that's not the right balance either.
[time=1013] There's a significant role for women.
[time=1015] And we also talked about the equality of the sexes spiritually that is so clearly taught both in the old and the New Testament.
[time=1021] God gave the 10 commandments to men and women.
[time=1024] God gave the feast of the Passover to men and women and God called both men and women to love them with all their heart, soul, and strength.
[time=1031] Then the same thought is reflected in the New Testament.
[time=1033] So while there's a real equality of the sexes in spirituality and in relationship with God, there is however a differing role and we'll explore that some more today.
[time=1044] - Well, these are very timely messages.
[time=1046] And again, we encourage you to keep watching the Bible hour so that you can hear the entire message, each one of them, so that you will understand what the Bible has to say concerning this issue.
[time=1057] Now, just before we close a number of months ago, a couple of years ago, in fact, we began the magazine called Fresh Moments.
[time=1065] If you are not studying the word of God on a daily basis, here's an excellent opportunity for you to do that.
[time=1071] It's a booklet that has a passage of scripture for each day to read and then comments about that passage of scripture to help you understand what you just read.
[time=1080] There are also other articles on theological issues in the magazine and we'd like to send it to you this month, absolutely free.
[time=1087] You can receive Fresh Moments by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East state, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1097] Once again, you can write to the Bible hour for Fresh Moments, the address is 7,400 East state, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1111] Well, at this time, we're gonna return to the regular portion of our program and we're excited about it because our own pastor, Peter Koby, is singing a solo for us, so stay with us, won't you?
[time=1122] (upbeat music)

[time=1285] (audience applauds)
[time=1292] - Thank you very much, Peter Coby.
[time=1298] It's amazing all the gifts that God has given to Peter.
[time=1302] His ability to lead our choir.
[time=1304] We were together Thursday night, taking down the Christmas tree.
[time=1307] Just having a great time and watching Peter lead this whole group of guys with such ability, and we're thankful you're here, and thankful for the partnership we have with you here in the gospel.
[time=1317] Well, if you have your Bibles, let me invite you to take them this morning, and we will continue in our study of 1 Timothy, chapter two, verses nine to 15, and come to our last message on the role of women in the church.
[time=1334] And I know for me, it has been a very challenging study.
[time=1336] It's caused me to think and think hard, some things, as a result of the study, I feel rather clear on another things.
[time=1345] I still feel a sense of uncertainty, but I am thankful for the study.
[time=1350] Let me read the passage and then we'll go from there.
[time=1353] Likewise, I want women to adorn themselves with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly garments, chapter two, verse 10.
[time=1367] But rather by means of good works as befits women making a claim to godliness.
[time=1372] Let a woman quietly receive instruction with entire submissiveness, but I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet.
[time=1382] For it was Adam who was first created and then Eve, and it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being quite deceived fell into transgression.
[time=1391] But women shall be preserved through the bearing of children if they continue in faith and love and sanctity with self-restraint.
[time=1398] We began our study just by way of review, for those of you who may have not been here through the holidays with an understanding of the attire of women, up at verse nine.
[time=1408] Paul says that women are to adorn themselves.
[time=1410] The word is cosmeto from which we get our word cosmetics to make yourself up, to arrange yourself, to put yourself in proper order.
[time=1417] Why?
[time=1418] For the coming of the saints and their assembling for the worship, and that is clear, because we're in a section that Paul is describing in chapter three, verse 15, is how we ought to conduct ourself in the household of God.
[time=1430] This is instruction to women as to how they ought to act in the household of God, the saints congregated together on a day such as this to worship the Lord.
[time=1439] And he says, "I want women to adorn themselves "with proper clothing, modestly and discreetly, "not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly garments." And that is the description of women that would put literally their entire fortune in their hair and distract the attention of the people from worshiping God and unto themselves.
[time=1459] Their attitude is described also in verse nine in these two words, modestly and discreetly.
[time=1464] And these words are descriptive of a woman's shrinking back from anything that would be improper or sensual or wrongly inducing a man to think thoughts that are not holy and righteous and pure.
[time=1477] The word discreetly is also colored with this flavor as it talks about her passions being completely and totally under control.
[time=1485] So the godly woman is concerned more as it says in verse 10 that she be adorned with good works, godly behavior and righteousness rather than an ostentatious show of material wealth and even in that an eliciting of sexual and sinful thoughts from men that might lead from that in even to fornication which is often occurring in churches of this day and in our own.
[time=1509] So women first are described in their attire and then their attitude and then we looked at their role.
[time=1516] What is the role of women in the church in verses 11 and 12?
[time=1520] And we found the key phrase there to be that women are not allowed to teach or to exercise authority, to teach meaning to proclaim the doctrine of the church and the public assembly to establish the doctrinal framework that the people of God function in and through that declaration to exercise the authority of the word of God.
[time=1538] That is a function that has not been given to women.
[time=1542] And in order to help us with that conclusion and to feel comfortable with that in light of the fact that this is a very controversial and I should say unpopular conclusion to draw from a passage such as this.
[time=1553] And because of that we took a few steps back to ask ourselves is that consistent?
[time=1557] Is this teaching consistent with the rest of scripture?
[time=1560] And we found that unanimously it is.
[time=1563] We understand that the function of teaching and exercising authority has been given not to women but instead and explicitly given to men and not just men in general.
[time=1572] Men who are qualified as elders, as overseers, as shepherds.
[time=1577] Men whose qualifications are listed for us in chapter three verses one and following the very next subject that Paul will take up.
[time=1586] We see that they are given to the church, these men to guard from the savage wolves, their doctrinal foundation to protect the truth.
[time=1594] In fact elders are to be considered worthy of double honor if they are the ones who work hard or work to the point of exhaustion in the teaching of the word of God.
[time=1605] Titus one describes them as holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching that he may be able both to exhort in sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.
[time=1618] So clearly his job description as pastor, teacher, as elder, as overseer, as bishop is explicitly stated to have this function of teaching and through that exercising authority.
[time=1629] He is not to do that in a removed way, a distant way as lording it over his flock or his charge as leadership in the world often does but first Peter five says he is to be an example.
[time=1641] In other words he is to submit to his own teaching, he is to live his own teaching.
[time=1644] And in that be an example.
[time=1647] In fact we saw in Ephesians chapter four that it is in his title pastor and teacher or pastor that is teacher.
[time=1655] So distinctive is his function as a teaching pastor that they call him that, a pastor teacher.
[time=1661] And it is there that we find the development of the church into maturity.
[time=1665] In verse seven of chapter four God gives gifts to the whole body and how are those gifts given diversely to the entire body going to come in concert and to build up the body to the maturing of the saints it is through the ministry of the pastoring preaching teacher who exhorts and teaches and leads in the preaching of the word of God.
[time=1684] We backed up even another step to say is this really a safe interpretation of this text by going all the way back to the Old Testament and noting that there were no women in leadership as a general rule in the Old Testament.
[time=1696] No women kings save Apaliah recorded in second Chronicles 22 who usurped the throne who murdered her descendants.
[time=1703] Those who would be the rightful ones to ascend to the authority of the throne.
[time=1707] She missed one.
[time=1708] Her sister-in-law hid it from her.
[time=1711] Joe Ash was his name and six years later when he was able he took the throne back.
[time=1716] We find no women priests in the Old Testament.
[time=1719] We find that there was no ongoing prophetic ministry of any woman in the Old Testament.
[time=1724] She did, there is no woman recorded to have written any book of the Old Testament or even any portion of the Old Testament.
[time=1732] We found the same thing consistent in the New Testament.
[time=1734] As we study the New Testament we find no women pastors or preachers or teachers or elders or overseers or evangelists by office.
[time=1742] No portion of the New Testament was written by a woman.
[time=1745] And so we feel comfortable with what Paul has so plainly said in this text by backing up and saying is that consistent with the rest of scripture.
[time=1753] We noted that that does not mean that women are inferior in their relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1759] They are not second-class citizens in the kingdom of God.
[time=1762] We remember that God gave the Ten Commandments in Exodus chapter 20 both to the men and to the women and he held them both accountable and blessed them as they obeyed that.
[time=1775] We also found that to be true with the Shema in Deuteronomy that you should love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind and strength was given to both men and women alike and they were both called to that internal expression of their relationship with God.
[time=1788] We found that men and women alike would participate in the greatest of all feasts.
[time=1792] Exodus chapter 12, the Passover.
[time=1794] We found that men and women alike could take the most sacred vow of all in the nation of Israel, the Nazarite vow, which allowed them to consecrate themselves exclusively to God.
[time=1804] That was done both by men and by women.
[time=1806] So there is no second-classness to all of this.
[time=1810] It is a difference in design and it is a different in function but it is not different in relationship with God and with Christ.
[time=1819] So the question we posed this morning is why?
[time=1822] Why has God so chosen to make it this way?
[time=1825] Why is it that he has not given the function of teaching and exercising authority to women but instead has given it to men?
[time=1832] And the answer is found in verses 13 and 14 and it's a two-part answer.
[time=1836] The first part is because verse 13, it was Adam who was first created and then Eve.
[time=1843] The second part to the answer is in verse 14 and it was not Adam who was deceived but the woman being quite deceived fell into the transgression.
[time=1853] Now there is a whole lot that I do not understand about these two verses.
[time=1858] In fact, I probably understand less about them than I think I understand about them.
[time=1864] But I do understand one thing about them.
[time=1867] It is this, that by tying his instruction that women should not teach or exercise authority, to the creative event and to the fall, he means to say that this instruction is both universal and timeless.
[time=1885] In other words, the fact that women should not teach or exercise authority by virtue of the fact that that is tied to how God created Adam and Eve and to how Adam and Eve fell in the garden, the fact that he ties it back to those two historic events means that his instruction is universal and timeless.
[time=1905] Some would hold and by those some I mean those propagating the egalitarian view which promotes women into ordination and promotes women into positions of leadership in the church would say that what Paul is saying here is really only against some specific problems, some local situation in which women had been involved.
[time=1923] In fact, teaching false doctrine.
[time=1926] Some would say that the issue here isn't that women are teaching, it's what they are teaching, it's that they are teaching false doctrine and that as long as women don't teach false doctrine they can teach and with that I take issue.
[time=1939] I take issue with that because Paul doesn't say anywhere that women are teaching false doctrine.
[time=1943] He nowhere says women stop teaching your false doctrine.
[time=1946] He says women don't teach and don't exercise authority because of the way God created you and because of the way the fall occurred.
[time=1954] The issue then isn't that women were teaching heresy, the issue is that women were teaching and that is what Paul is forbidding.
[time=1965] Paul's reasoning in these two verses is grounded on two origins, one positive, the other negative.
[time=1970] Positively speaking, women should be under the male leadership
[time=1976] in the church because Adam was created before Eve.
[time=1979] Negatively speaking, women are to submit to the male leadership in the church because Eve was deceived in the fall and Adam wasn't.
[time=1986] So this is not some cultural issue, this cannot be dismissed as applying only to the saints at Ephesus.
[time=1993] This is not some Pauline bias, this is not some rabbinical gloss, this is in fact the truth that is grounded in the very book of Genesis.
[time=2001] So with that conclusion I'm comfortable and feel rather dogmatic.
[time=2006] When we move beyond that, when we move beyond to explain, okay, well what is it about the way that God created Adam and Eve?
[time=2014] That should mean she shouldn't teach or exercise authority.
[time=2017] I feel much less dogmatic and you'll see why in a minute.
[time=2020] And when we move beyond that to say that, well, women shouldn't teach because she was totally deceived and he wasn't and to try to explain that to you as well, I feel equally confused.
[time=2032] But I have some thoughts and some observations and I'd like to submit them to you, to share them with you and encourage you to think about them and mull them over with what you know to be true about the word of God and in that way, pilgrimage with me to understand the word of God.
[time=2046] Let's begin in verse 13.
[time=2048] What does it mean that men are to teach and exercise authority not women because it was Adam who was first created and then Eve?
[time=2057] The word first, protos, can mean I just chose
[time=2063] to create him first and then her second as in that was the order that I did it.
[time=2067] Or it can mean that he was chief, that he was supreme, that he was created on purpose first because of some things I was doing in him that I was not going to do in her.
[time=2080] And I want to suggest that men are different from women.
[time=2083] And I also want to suggest that women are different from men and that they are different in ways that legitimately equip them to function more effectively in one sphere of responsibility than another.
[time=2099] Now at some points, this is obvious.
[time=2102] Men cannot bear children, that's obvious.
[time=2108] Women cannot impregnate men.
[time=2111] That is a difference that came about as a result of the creative effort, that is irreversible, it is unchangeable and it is obvious, but it is only physical or so it would seem.
[time=2123] What I am asking this is this question, is it possible that there are other differences between the male and the female that go beyond the anatomy, that go beyond the chemistry, which go beyond the bearing of children and the impregnating of men, differences in the essential makeup of what the male is and what the female is, which legitimately equip men to lead and women to follow.
[time=2147] That's my question, that's what I'm proposing, that's what I think.
[time=2151] First Corinthians 11 says this, "Man is the image and glory of God, "but the woman is the glory of man.
[time=2162] "For man does not originate from woman, "but woman from man.
[time=2167] "For indeed man was not created for a woman's sake, "but woman for the man's sake.
[time=2173] "For the man is not of the woman, "but the woman of the man." What does that mean?
[time=2178] We could also think back to Genesis chapter two and we can realize that Adam had just named all the animals and found, "No, what?" Help mate, that was suitable.
[time=2190] After that God put him to sleep and took from his rib and fashioned into the form of a woman, a suitable help mate.
[time=2198] So what I am suggesting is that what is going on
[time=2204] in the creative event here in first Timothy chapter one, which restricts their roles and changes their function and behavior, is that something was in the creative event by way of how God made Adam that made him distinctly different than the way he made Eve.
[time=2220] And we would resist and reject the idea of the unisex that says men and women are only different on a physical level and beyond that there is no difference which allows them to assume any and exchange any role and any leadership function in the home or in the church.
[time=2236] Instead I would suggest that in Ephesians chapter five what Paul is saying when he says that the man is the head of the wife, it is more than just role playing.
[time=2247] It is more than just man taking a certain posture and woman taking a particular posture.
[time=2252] But instead the husband is to lead and the wife is to follow because the husband is a man and he has been made differently and the wife is to follow because she is a woman and she has been made differently, each of them, these unique differences allowing them to function better and differently in different spheres of responsibility.
[time=2275] That is why when we come to a passage such as this one and the instruction about the church that this too is not arbitrary.
[time=2281] That this too is tied to who they are, who they were created to be.
[time=2286] In other words the responsibility given to the men to teach and defend doctrine has been given to them by virtue of the way God created them differently than he did women.
[time=2297] And the fact that women have not been given that role but have been given the role of disciple or learner in the church and the public assembly as we saw last week that she bears and holds that function because she has been created differently than the man.
[time=2313] Is it possible that God made the pair in such a manner that it is natural for the man to lead and for the woman to follow?
[time=2321] For him to be the initiator and for her to be the responder.
[time=2326] Is it possible that the tendency for Eve to follow was embedded in her very soul as she came forth from the hand of her creator.
[time=2335] And because of that she is to live in his lead, find safety in his strength and protection in his courage.
[time=2341] Now what would really be helpful in answering some of these questions that I'm raising is if at the end of chapter two of Genesis and before chapter three which of course is the fall.
[time=2353] If there were four or five or six or seven chapters all about how the man and the woman related to each other before the fall and we could just here these narrative accounts of how they acted and how they treated each other and who was leading and who was following it.
[time=2368] All these, it would be just wonderful if we could turn back there and find some extra space between Genesis two and Genesis three and understand more about their relationship before the fall.
[time=2379] There is really only one verse that describes their relationship before the fall.
[time=2383] It's at the very end of Genesis chapter two and it's this that the man and the woman were naked and not ashamed.
[time=2390] They were naked, not just physically, they were naked emotionally and mentally and spiritually and physically and there was no shame involved in that because there was no sin.
[time=2400] They totally loved each other, they totally saw each other, they totally understood each other, they never misunderstood, they never violated it, it was just absolute total bliss, naked and not ashamed.
[time=2409] That's it, then you go to chapter three, verse one and you come immediately to the serpent and to the fall.
[time=2416] So we don't know as much as we'd like to know about that.
[time=2419] Now we do know something, we do know that the way that God cursed them after the fall was different.
[time=2427] God did not curse them the same way.
[time=2429] God did not say to both of them, this is your curse.
[time=2432] Instead, He said to Adam, I will make it difficult for you where you work.
[time=2439] I will make it difficult for you to toil and produce food by the sweat of your brow when you go off to work and they lived in an agrarian community, when you go off to perform your function and to do your job, it will not go well for you and it will not go well for you by my design.
[time=2454] I am cursing you as a result and punishing you of the fall.
[time=2458] To the woman, he said something entirely different.
[time=2461] He didn't involve her work in the workplace, he involved her relationship to Adam.
[time=2468] He said, now from this day forward you will bring forth your children in pain, childbearing in pain which is a direct relationship of being with Adam.
[time=2478] And he also said that your desire will be for him, your desire.
[time=2482] In other words, he's saying to Eve, your desire will be for your husband and that word desire doesn't mean, oh boy, here comes my husband.
[time=2489] Desire is meant to convey the idea of mastery.
[time=2492] It's used only one other place in the Pentateuch, Genesis 4, verse 7, and it's talking about sin having mastery over an individual.
[time=2500] So God curses Adam in a way that affects his world, his work a day world.
[time=2506] And he curses Eve in a way that affects her direct relationship to Adam, both through bearing children and the day to day relating to Adam and following his leadership.
[time=2515] Now I would suggest to you that God's judgment on both man and the woman were neither arbitrary, nor uncaring.
[time=2524] In other words, God didn't just think, well, let me see.
[time=2529] We'll curse your workplace, we'll curse your child bearing.
[time=2533] Instead, I would like to suggest that God had a motive in that, that God was thinking and had a purpose behind that.
[time=2541] In the fall, Adam and Eve had said, we are independent.
[time=2546] We are like God.
[time=2548] We do not need to depend upon the only true and living I am.
[time=2551] We will live without him.
[time=2553] We will live outside of his rule.
[time=2554] That was the temptation that you shall be like God, the distinguishing characteristic about God in this particular setting, because neither Adam nor Eve had any sin in them, is that he was a self-sustaining, totally autonomous, independent being, and they by virtue of having to live in his garden and not eat that particular tree were indeed very dependent.
[time=2572] And it acknowledges their dependence upon him.
[time=2575] And in the fall, they said, no, off with these shackles, we will be independent.
[time=2580] We will live apart from God.
[time=2582] We will live our own way.
[time=2584] And in the curse, God said, absolutely not.
[time=2587] In fact, the very thing for which I have created you to do, Adam, which is to make a living, which is to lead your family, which is to move out into the world and support yourself and your family, I curse you in that very realm, the core of your existence, so that you will know that you are dependent upon me, so that your days will have difficulty, so that your bank balance won't always work, so that you won't always get the jobs you need, so that your life won't always just glide on, as it might have had you stayed in absolute dependence upon me.
[time=2613] So you will have a daily reminder that I am God and you need me.
[time=2618] And to the woman, he said, at the very core of your existence, you were created to support your husband and love your husband and bear his children and follow his lead, at the very core of what I have made you to be, I curse it, so that you too will be constantly aware of the fact that you can't live without me, that you must be dependent upon my resources and my strength through the power of the Spirit of God to find your way through your life.
[time=2640] In other words, in response to Adam and Eve's titanic self-assertion that we don't need God, we'll live without God, we will go our own way, God built into the curse a dependence factor that struck at the very core of their being, so that they would constantly return to him.
[time=2658] Now I would suggest that supports what I am trying to say that when God created Adam, he created him differently than when he created Eve.
[time=2667] And again, that difference legitimately equips them
[time=2673] to handle responsibility in different areas and that their deepest joys will come when they give and receive in unique ways in those areas, both personally and corporately.
[time=2686] In other words, let not the woman enter into a sphere of activity for God that he had never designed her, she was built differently to minister in different areas.
[time=2700] Now I wanna stress the word different and if you haven't heard it enough already, I'll say it again, different, not inferior.
[time=2707] God has made us different, I propose, not inferior.
[time=2712] I have far too many personal experiences with women to know that they are not inferior.
[time=2718] I could give you hundreds, I'll give you a few.
[time=2721] I can think back as a junior at the University of Southern California, I was studying business there and I was in my most difficult accounting class and I just worked and worked and worked.
[time=2730] I got there early, it was a seven o'clock class, I sat near the front, I made sure I'd had some coffee, I'd studied my notes, I was prepared, I took copious notes, hanging on every possible word because I wasn't really good at this stuff and then I would go home and do my homework and I got through, I think I barely gotta be.
[time=2747] And then there was my good friend, Jan Rawless, who was a Christian and we were good friends and we would go to church together and she would come to that same class, about 15 minutes late.
[time=2756] And we would hear her clank up the stairs, she had her high heels on it, it was an old building with no carpeting and about 15 after the hour you could count on hearing Jan make her way up the free flights of stairs, she'd walk in, say hello to the teachers, sorry I'm late, she'd sit down and then write a letter to somebody.
[time=2770] Never saw her open the book.
[time=2774] And then I'd check up on her, how you doing many?
[time=2776] It's our nervous about the big exam, she's all, yeah.
[time=2779] Have you read your, she's your heart?
[time=2781] So I'm sweating to get this lousy low grade B.
[time=2786] I don't think the woman cracked the book and got the highest grade in the class.
[time=2791] And there were a whole host of guys, not like me who were studying marketing, I mean there were guys who were accounting majors who this was their life, they were gonna beat her for all she was worth and they couldn't do it.
[time=2801] Inferior, huh, huh, no way.
[time=2805] I think about playing tennis and I played a lot of tennis in high school and I love to play tennis and I got invited out on the court with this girl by the name of Lisa Seaman.
[time=2813] And we started rallying the ball and I immediately knew this was not going to be a good day for the male sex and she just wiped me right off the court.
[time=2822] I mean it was, I didn't get a point, it was ridiculous.
[time=2825] If you quote me on that I'll deny it.
[time=2827] How about spirituality?
[time=2831] Are they inferior spiritually?
[time=2832] I don't think so.
[time=2834] I could list off a whole bunch of women whose spirituality I envy in a godly sense.
[time=2840] When I look at their maturity and I look at their balance and I look at their relationships and I look at their commitment to God and their commitment to serve.
[time=2849] And I think my lands, you rebuke me by your life.
[time=2853] One of them was Betty Price.
[time=2855] We worked together at Grace Community Church for six years and then five years together at the Masters College and we were thrown into situations because we worked in the same department.
[time=2864] She was a dean of women and we would work together on various discipline situations and there would be parents involved, angry parents involved and misunderstanding students involved and big decisions and whether they stay in college or not and over and over and over and over again, this woman showed an incredible wisdom and balance and ability to relate to all the people involved, including me and I would look at her and say, now here is a godly person.
[time=2887] So please, I am not saying inferior, I am saying different with respect, mutual respect.
[time=2895] What I think Paul is saying here, I think Paul is saying here is that the reason that women are not to exercise, teach or exercise authority over a man is because she has been created differently than the way God created Adam and vice versa.
[time=2912] And to ask her to step into the role of teaching or exercising authority in the public assembly, defining the church doctrine is like asking a fish to get out of the water and swim on the land.
[time=2924] She was not created for that.
[time=2925] There are fundamental differences in her constitution.
[time=2928] Can I identify them for you?
[time=2929] No, can I tell you exactly what they are?
[time=2932] No, that's my general impression of what I think God is saying here.
[time=2936] Secondly, verse 14, what's the second reason that women are not to exercise authority through their teaching?
[time=2943] It was Adam, excuse me, it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman being quite deceived.
[time=2949] Now what I want you to notice here is that you have a contrast going on.
[time=2954] Adam was not deceived, the woman was deceived and your Bible probably says quite deceived or successfully deceived or totally deceived.
[time=2962] That's because the word there in the Greek for deceived has a preposition on the front of it which intensifies it.
[time=2967] She was utterly deceived, completely.
[time=2970] The serpent successfully deceived her.
[time=2972] He did not successfully deceive Adam.
[time=2975] Now you would come back to Genesis for a minute and let's try to understand that.
[time=2987] What does it mean?
[time=2988] She was deceived, utterly deceived, completely deceived and he wasn't.
[time=2992] Well notice at the end of verse six,
[time=2999] I'll read from the beginning of verse six, Genesis three, verse six.
[time=3002] When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate and she gave also to her husband with her, with her and he ate.
[time=3017] Now the word with in the Hebrew, a word I can't remember how to pronounce, is a word for proximity, immediate proximity.
[time=3024] Now what you think, where was Adam when she took the bite out of the apple or whatever, pear, where was he?
[time=3034] I'll suggest that this verse allows him to have been right there, right here.
[time=3042] She ate and then notice her leadership.
[time=3046] She gave also, she gave also to her husband who was with her, who was in immediate proximity to her.
[time=3054] Thank you.
[time=3055] The fall.
[time=3058] Now nowhere says how long he was standing right next to her.
[time=3065] So when did he show up?
[time=3068] Some of you might have been taught as I was that he wasn't there when the serpent was talking to the woman and if he wasn't there then, then somehow in that discussion that goes on from verses one through six, he then has to show up as she is eating because he's got to be with her so that she can hand it to him.
[time=3092] So when did he show up?
[time=3095] Well I don't know, it doesn't say, but I'll give you an idea.
[time=3100] I mean I'll give you my thinking.
[time=3102] I think he was there the whole time.
[time=3105] I think you heard the whole thing.
[time=3108] I think he was standing right there at the tree with her the whole time.
[time=3112] She heard everything the Satan said and she was what?
[time=3116] Totally deceived.
[time=3118] He heard everything the serpent said and he wasn't deceived.
[time=3122] What's the import of 1 Timothy 2, verse 14, to say that she was deceived and he wasn't deceived if she was the only one that got exposed to the great deceiver?
[time=3132] Well so what, he wasn't there, he didn't hear it.
[time=3133] Of course he wasn't deceived.
[time=3135] And he's certainly not gonna be deceived when he walks up to a woman who has taken a bite of the forbidden fruit and fallen into sin and her whole countenance, as you know from scripture, your countenance will reveal your spiritual condition.
[time=3146] Her whole countenance now has gone from this pristine, pure, unsined, godly woman to now having fallen into sin and you're telling me that Adam walks up and doesn't notice that?
[time=3157] There's nothing to be deceived, she's obviously fallen.
[time=3160] Something is wrong, she looks totally different.
[time=3163] There's nothing deceptive about that, it would be written all over her face.
[time=3167] What I am offering to you as a thought, not a dogmatic thought, but a thought, is that they were there together.
[time=3173] And how might it have gone?
[time=3176] Verse one, now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field.
[time=3180] What's the Lord God had made and he said to the woman, to who?
[time=3184] Now you think about this, if I'm the most crafty of all and I take the most crafty animal of all and I wanna bring these people into sin and I know because I was there, the stars were there at the creation, the morning stars, the heavens sang and rejoiced at the creation of God.
[time=3199] I saw Adam get created first and I saw as Lucifer the woman.
[time=3202] I know the order that's there, the order that is referred to in verse 13 of our passage back in Timothy.
[time=3207] I know how they're supposed to function and I wanna lead them into sin.
[time=3210] What's my first move?
[time=3212] I'll reverse their leadership roles.
[time=3214] I'll speak to her.
[time=3215] So he addresses her.
[time=3217] Indeed, and what does he say?
[time=3220] Has God said, you know the word he uses for God there and the Hebrew is Elohim.
[time=3224] It's one of the most general terms of God in all of the Bible.
[time=3230] In other words, has this, has this distant and aloof deity said and said what?
[time=3237] You shall not eat from any tree of the garden.
[time=3240] This is a gross exaggeration of what God had said.
[time=3242] God in fact had said, you can eat from any tree of the garden except the one.
[time=3247] But the tempter comes and said, has this distant removed, uncaring, unloving deity said that you can't eat from any of these trees?
[time=3257] You know what I'm wishing?
[time=3260] If in fact Adam is there?
[time=3263] I want him to physically stand in between the woman and the snake and say, first of all, you talk to me.
[time=3271] Secondly, his name isn't just Elohim.
[time=3276] It is the great Yahweh.
[time=3278] It is the great loving and personal awesome God who displayed his personal and unique love to me by creating that which so perfectly compliments my very existence.
[time=3290] Don't tell me he's distant and aloof.
[time=3292] And thirdly, he said, we could eat from all the trees of the garden except that one over there.
[time=3297] Except the one you're in maybe or the one we're standing next to.
[time=3301] And assume his role as a leader and allow her to assume her role as a follower to be protected by virtue of how she was created to be protected.
[time=3311] But he doesn't do that if in fact he's there.
[time=3316] First two, what happens?
[time=3318] And the woman said to the serpent, from the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat, she corrected him, but the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, you shall not eat and then she adds or touch it and then she weakens it lest you die.
[time=3334] Now she gets into the exaggeration mode with the tempting serpent and says, man, we can't even touch it.
[time=3340] Yeah.
[time=3341] And God had not said that.
[time=3342] God had said, you shall not eat from it.
[time=3344] She is the one now who is following and falling into the deceptive ploy of the serpent and saying, oh, you're going to exaggerate, I'll exaggerate.
[time=3352] We can't even touch it.
[time=3353] And beyond that, she weakens God's command by saying lest you die when in fact God had said in the day ye eat thereof, you shall what?
[time=3362] You shall surely die.
[time=3364] So she's already becoming putty in the hands of this serpent and the hands of Satan himself.
[time=3369] And now he moves in verse four from settled heat to outright lie and the serpent said to the woman, you shall surely not die.
[time=3378] And then he deceives her with this, for God knows
[time=3384] that in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God knowing good from evil.
[time=3389] Some of that is true and some of that is false.
[time=3392] What is false is that you shall not die.
[time=3394] They will die spiritually and eventually physically.
[time=3397] What is partly true is that their eyes will be opened and they will be able to see good from evil, but they will not be like God in the sense that they will be independent and self-sustaining, which is the alluring.
