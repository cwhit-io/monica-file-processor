[time=0] You see, I thought everybody was supposed to get married.
[time=4] Not so.
[time=6] God has given to some the gift of singleness, and if God has given a person the gift of singleness, it's their privilege, really their responsibility to live outside of marriage.
[time=15] He is a single person giving glory to God.
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=38] Thank you for joining us.
[time=40] Today Pastor Moore begins a new series on singles.
[time=43] He is entitled today's message, The Bliss and Blisters of Singleness.
[time=48] Most individuals probably would not plan in the early stages of their lives to remain single.
[time=54] Marriage and family are considered to be more normal.
[time=56] Does God really expect some individuals to remain single?
[time=60] What are the positive and negative aspects of being single?
[time=65] Today's message is the first in this series from 1 Corinthians chapter 7.
[time=70] Our special music today will include our sanctuary choir singing, Praise to God whose love was shown.
[time=78] And Kevin Rowe is singing, Be Our Guest.
[time=82] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's listen to the Handbell Choir as they call us to worship with the song entitled, "Westminster Chimes."
[time=100] [MUSIC], "Westminster Chimes" is the first in this series.
[time=245] [APPLAUSE]
[time=250] [MUSIC]
[time=267] Praise to God whose love was shown.
[time=278] [MUSIC - 148 seconds]
[time=451] Pastor Russ and I are very pleased that you joined us for the Bible Hour today. Thank you for staying tuned for the rest of our program.
[time=458] We'd like to tell you about some events that are taking place in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church and our ministries here.
[time=465] A number of weeks ago, we sent out a survey to all of you that are on our mailing list.
[time=470] This last week, Russ, we had a great time as a staff of the Bible Hour going over those surveys.
[time=476] It was very helpful for us in the responses that we received and even the comments that encouraged us.
[time=483] We were very thankful for the number of people that responded.
[time=486] First of all, it gave us a tremendous sense of understanding about what's going on in our ministry and the hearts and lives of those who view.
[time=492] We did carefully review the surveys and spent a lot of time analyzing the data and talking about ways to continue to improve the effectiveness of the ministry.
[time=500] And I know that the leadership team is excited about what God is going to do in our midst in 1992.
[time=506] Many of you have been so faithful in your support of the Bible Hour and we want you to know that we are very aware of that and very interested in seeing to it that the Bible Hour is as effective as it can be for winning people to Christ and encouraging them in their faith.
[time=520] Let me tell you about a concert that's coming up. It's entitled Sing for Joy and it's on Saturday, February 8th.
[time=527] The Pure Heart Ministries and Black Hawk Baptist Church will be sponsoring a contest where many of our local area singers will come and they will compete and then the winners will sing on that Saturday evening at 7 p.m. here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=541] We also have as our special guest, Jeffrey Benward, a man who is from Fort Wayne has now gone on and sings around the world and he'll be back with us in Fort Wayne and will be singing and hosting that concert.
[time=555] Once again, that's the Sing for Joy concert on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=563] Or also, just before we went on the air, we were talking about fresh moments and that gift offer and the ministry that it has and someone was commenting that their neighbor even was using it and it's a very effective tool for studying the Word.
[time=577] It really is and any time you can find something like that that'll help you get into the Word of God and spend time with the Lord and someone of a directed study but one that really prompts your heart and devotion to him, something like that is invaluable.
[time=590] I used it this week and even yesterday we had a music clinic here and I gave a copy to each one of the local music directors from other churches and it is an encouraging tool for studying the Word of God.
[time=605] We'd like to send a copy of Fresh Moments, a Bible study where there's a devotional portion of scripture that you could read.
[time=612] We'd like to send this to you and get you acquainted with it and you can receive it absolutely free by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=626] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=636] We go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our program, Kevin Roll will be singing for us and then Pastor, you'll be on a somewhat related topic to what you've been preaching but a little bit more directed to singles in this world.
[time=649] We've been talking about the woman's role in the church from 1 Timothy chapter 2 and it seems to be a natural progression to go from there into some thoughts about the bliss and blisters of being single, so I'm looking forward to that.
[time=661] We're going to go back now to here Kevin Roll and then the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore. I hope that you'll stay tuned.
[time=691] [MUSIC]
[time=708] You said that you needed a temple, a place where your spirit could dwell.
[time=718] You long to be near to your people, a shadow of Emmanuel, Solomon fulfilled the instructions.
[time=733] Only one detail remained, gathered around the holy of holies they called for the one who would reign.
[time=750] Be out again, be out again, receive our praise and be blessed, be out again.
[time=776] Only spirit can dwell, be out again.
[time=786] [MUSIC]
[time=793] Through the years your heart hasn't faltered, you still desire to be with your own.
[time=803] So you designed a new kind of temple for Jesus, the chief cornerstone.
[time=813] You've allowed us to be your temple, our heart is now where you rest.
[time=823] Your residence is now in your children, holy spirit can be our guest, be out again, be out again.
[time=843] Receive our praise and be blessed, be out again, be out again.
[time=859] Only spirit can dwell, be out again, be out again.
[time=874] Receive our praise and be blessed, be out again, be out again.
[time=888] Only spirit can dwell, be out again.
[time=903] [MUSIC]
[time=933] Amen. Thank you, Kevin. I'm so thankful for your presence in our church and for the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[time=944] And I know that's my prayer as I prepare each message that the Holy Spirit will not only come and be our guest,
[time=951] but that He will come and convict our hearts and teach us in the things of God's Word.
[time=957] Well, if you take your Bible this morning, let's open it to 1 Timothy, 1 Timothy chapter 2, and for those of you who might be joining us this morning,
[time=966] and maybe not have been here for a while because of the holidays or you're a visitor, we've been studying through the book of 1 Timothy,
[time=972] and we've come to the end of chapter 2.
[time=975] And the last several verses of chapter 2 have been involved in the discussion of the woman's role in the church.
[time=982] How is the woman to function in the church of Jesus Christ?
[time=985] How are the women of Blackhawk to function here?
[time=987] And we have been challenged by this study and enjoyed it.
[time=992] But as we come to the end of chapter 2, I want to take a break from the flow of Paul's thought in the book of Timothy,
[time=999] even as I did at the end of chapter 1.
[time=1001] You remember when we came to the end of chapter 1, I stopped and gave some attention for about three weeks to the topic of giving.
[time=1008] And we were in a fundraiser then for our new building, and we're so thankful that that's behind us now and that God has given us grace,
[time=1014] and we raise more money than we even thought or had as a minimum goal.
[time=1019] And again, I want to take a break from the development of the argument of the book of 1 Timothy, and I want to do that because as we come off of Paul's discussion, as it concluded there in verse 15 of chapter 2,
[time=1031] he was speaking about the women and their contribution to the kingdom of God, and saying that it wouldn't necessarily be through the teaching or the exercising of authority over a man as they congregate in the assembly,
[time=1042] but instead by the raising up of a godly seed.
[time=1046] And that has raised some questions.
[time=1048] That's raised some questions in the minds of some of our single people in particular.
[time=1053] The reactions on the whole to the several messages on the women's rule have been rather positive, and for that I'm thankful.
[time=1059] There have been times after the last two services where people would come up and shake my hand with great enthusiasm and say thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[time=1066] That needed to be said, thank you, thank you, thank you, well said, and I'd say thank you, thank you, say that to me any time you want, as often as you want.
[time=1072] You can write me letters like that, you can say all that you'd like.
[time=1075] Others, I know, struggled with the series a little bit.
[time=1077] There were some, I think, in each of the last two messages on the series on women in the church, where just as we would really kind of get into the text in each service, a couple of women would get out and walk out of the room.
[time=1088] I don't think it was the same gals every time, and I didn't really take note, but it sensed, I got the sense that they didn't want to hear any more of that, and so they left.
[time=1096] Others, I know, have, I've heard, have had some discussions in the home, and what does this mean, and the father/daughter discussions, and the husband and wife discussions, and so there has been a level of thought about that, and I'm thankful for that.
[time=1109] I'm thankful that you listen, and that when you don't agree, you talk about that amongst yourselves, and oftentimes you'll write me letters, and I'll respond to you personally.
[time=1118] I do want to encourage you to, when you have a question on anything that I'm saying up here, whether you think I'm wrong, or you'd like further clarification, or you just want to affirm it, man, write me a letter.
[time=1127] I'd love to hear from you, and either respond personally, or through a message that comes forth.
[time=1131] In fact, this series of messages that I want to begin this morning on the topic of singleness really comes out of a discussion with one of the people in our church who, after the last message, approached me and said, "Man, it's not that I disagree with what you said about the role of women in the church, but I'm single."
[time=1148] And in fact, I am wondering how I fit in all of this, and this person happened to be a gal, and I really appreciated what she said, and we spent some time talking about that.
[time=1157] And so, I want to talk about singleness. In fact, I want to talk about the bliss and the blisters of being single.
[time=1167] And as I move into this, I don't want you to think that in any way I am recanting or equivocating on what I believe the text has said in verses 9 through 15 about the role of women.
[time=1178] I stand with deep conviction that the Word of God is clear, that as we have said, women are not to teach or exercise authority over a man.
[time=1185] And of course, we said that meant in the church, in the assembled body of believers, and the authority there is the authority of proclaiming doctrine and establishing the theological framework for a church, that is not the role of women.
[time=1197] I also believe that we cannot dismiss that instruction based on some cultural, contemporary problem that Paul was confronting in the city of Ephesus as he wrote this letter because he ties his reasoning to the created order and to the events that surrounded the fall.
[time=1214] I also do believe that what he is saying in verse 15 is that the basic, ordinary and the big picture, the general contribution that women are going to make in the church and to the kingdom of God is to raising up a godly seed.
[time=1228] So, don't misunderstand what I am going to do. I don't recant. I don't change that view. I just want to balance it.
[time=1234] Paul has said much about the women and their role as mothers and wives and raising children, but that's not all he said about women. That's not all he said about men.
[time=1243] There is a whole 'nother part that I want us to consider.
[time=1248] It's important that we do this. Do you realize that 20% of the people that meet on Sunday morning at Blackhawk in an ABF, 20% of the attendance in our ABF classes, is single?
[time=1260] That's about 350 people in our church, and we're privileged to have these single people.
[time=1265] 20% of the people living in our own city, the city of Fort Wayne, I guess 300,000 of us live here, about 60,000 are single.
[time=1273] Even a higher percentage than that would be true on the national level, and so as a church we want to become aware of what we'll call the bliss and the blisters of being single because we want to be informed, we want to be supportive, we want to be encouraging to those who are in our church that fall into that category.
[time=1289] Many of you are as parents coming to the point in your life where your children are out of high school and even out of college and into the career situation, and there's a whole host of questions that come into your home and into your life as you figure out and think through and grapple with the issue of singleness.
[time=1306] And I hope that these messages will give you a background and a framework in which to think through some of those important questions.
[time=1313] So in the series I want to go beyond what I briefly noted in last Lord's Day's message when I said that Paul's instructions here in First Timothy 2 doesn't mean that every woman is going to have children.
[time=1325] I also said that it doesn't mean that all women are going to get married, it just simply means in the flow of that context that their general contribution to the church will be through raising up a godly seed.
[time=1337] But the question comes what about those of us who are single, single because maybe I have the gift of singleness, or single because my desires to be married have to this date been frustrated, single because I am widowed, single and rapidly moving past the point of even being able to bear a child.
[time=1357] What does the word of God say to me? How am I to think about myself? How am I to view myself before God? How does God view my singleness?
[time=1367] And so if you allow me I want to switch hats this morning and maybe for a few more Sunday mornings and take off the hat which is advocating the role of the married women in the church and allow me to speak to the role of the single women and really the single men in God's kingdom.
[time=1383] And to do that, we'll not only need to switch hats but passages. So if you'll come with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 7, Paul of course wrote this passage as well and it balances our understanding of the movement of the kingdom of God by the people of God.
[time=1405] It's almost as if, I mean just to give a little perspective, it's almost as if we'd spent three weeks speaking about the wrath of God and we'd studied various passages all about the wrath of God and we'd extrapolated all about the wrath of God.
[time=1417] And at the end of a series like that you're going to want to back up and say well hold it, you know there's more to the story about God than the wrath of God.
[time=1423] Let's talk about the grace of God and then maybe we might spend a couple of weeks just balancing that. So again without recanting or equivocating but balancing, let's take a look at what the Word of God says about singles.
[time=1437] This is the most definitive statement in all of the recorded scriptures that God has made about the single state.
[time=1443] And we'll only get started in the passage this morning, probably the first nine verses and we'll give an overview of those but before we get into it I want you to know where we're going.
[time=1452] Paul in this passage does at least three things, he defends singleness, he defines the gift of singleness and he helps us diagnose ourselves, whether we have the gift of singleness.
[time=1465] So singleness defended, singleness defined and singleness diagnosed.
[time=1474] He begins in verse one, actually let's first read these nine verses and then move into verse one.
[time=1479] Now concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
[time=1485] But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband.
[time=1492] Let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife and likewise also the wife to her husband.
[time=1497] The wife does not have authority over her own body but the husband does and likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does.
[time=1506] Stop depriving one another except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer and come together again, let Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
[time=1516] Verse six, "But this I say by way of concession, not of command, yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am.
[time=1524] However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.
[time=1529] But I say to the unmarried and to the widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I am."
[time=1536] Verse nine, "But if they do not have self-control, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn."
[time=1545] He begins in verse one by saying concerning the things about what you wrote and apparently there were some questions that had arisen in the minds of the people at Corinth about singleness.
[time=1555] And though we don't have the benefit of reading their questions, we can listen to the answers that Paul gives.
[time=1562] And Paul is basically saying that it is good not to touch a woman, not to touch a woman.
[time=1568] Now what does that mean? The phrase to touch a woman is a euphemistic Jewish phrase that refers to sexual intercourse.
[time=1575] It means the physical intimacy of marriage or fornication if it happens to occur outside the bonds of marriage.
[time=1582] We know that from many places in the scriptures, Genesis chapter 20 describes Abraham telling King Abemalek that Sarah was his sister instead of his wife.
[time=1591] And King Abemalek didn't know any different than that. He believed Abraham, so he took this woman into his harem and was going to involve himself physically with her.
[time=1600] But God showed up in a dream that he gave to Abemalek and said, "Don't do that." And he said, "Why?"
[time=1607] And because that is not his sister, that's Abraham's wife. And King Abemalek said, "Oh, my lands, please don't destroy me."
[time=1614] And God said, "I also kept you from sinning against me, therefore I did not let you touch her. I did not let you have physical relationship with her."
[time=1623] The same phrase is used in Genesis 26 of Isaac and his wife and the same type of situation with the same king Abemalek.
[time=1631] The same phrase is used over in Ruth chapter 2, "Boe has desire me to keep Ruth pure and holy, instructed his men not to touch Ruth."
[time=1639] Proverbs 6.29 may give the clearest definition, "So is the one who goes into his neighbor's wife, whoever touches her will not go unpunished."
[time=1649] So Paul is saying that it is good for a man not to touch a woman or for a man not to be involved intimately with a woman.
[time=1656] And of course in his mind that would have been in the bonds of marriage.
[time=1659] So Paul is saying that it is good for a person not to marry.
[time=1663] It is good to be single. It is good to be unmarried as long as that is sexually pure.
[time=1671] Now he in this phrase is defending the state of singleness against some impressions that were there.
[time=1677] The first one we can see is in the text in verses 3 and following.
[time=1681] Talking about the husband and wife relationship and duty one to another but really only tangential to the greater issue of singleness.
[time=1688] Verse 3. Let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife and likewise also the wife to her husband.
[time=1694] The wife does not have authority over his own body, excuse me over her own body, but the husband does.
[time=1699] And likewise also the husband does not have authority over his own body but the wife does.
[time=1703] So stop depriving one another except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer.
[time=1708] In other words there apparently had developed in the city of Corinth an erroneous doctrine that true spirituality was found when you utterly removed yourself from all sexual contact.
[time=1717] And this would have been an over emphasis on the idea of being single.
[time=1720] Almost type the idea of becoming a priest or becoming a nun.
[time=1724] That would be our contemporary understanding of it. I don't think they were thinking that.
[time=1728] But the idea is I can really be spiritual if I totally remove myself from anything that is sexual.
[time=1734] And so some of the men apparently in the church and some of the women in the church were catching on to this false doctrine and saying well
[time=1741] then I'll just apply that within my marriage and we won't even have sexual relationships within the marriage.
[time=1746] And Paul is saying that's ridiculous, that's not right.
[time=1749] That is not the proper understanding of being single or singleness or celibacy.
[time=1754] If you are married do your duty inside the marriage.
[time=1757] Love your wife, love your husband, satisfy their physical desires.
[time=1761] Your body is not your own, your body is your wife, so your body is your husband.
[time=1765] And of course Romans 12 tells us that ultimately our body is God's.
[time=1769] It's a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God.
[time=1772] But when we take the vows of marriage God so approves that in a delegated way our body is no longer our own.
[time=1778] It is God's and secondly it is our spouse.
[time=1782] So he first corrects or defends singleness against this kind of exaggerated view of sexual purity and therefore some new level of spirituality.
[time=1792] Not so Paul says.
[time=1796] And then again another point that he defended against and not specifically referenced in this particular passage but the background against which it would have been written.
[time=1804] Christianity coming out of Judaism and the great Jewish tradition that everybody was supposed to get married and the sooner the better.
[time=1811] Jewish boys typically married at the ages of 17 or 18 and in fact the Jews in Babylonian captivity set the age of 14 to be married.
[time=1821] Marriage was regarded by them as a duty among the Jews so that a man was considered to have sinned if he had reached the age of 20 and had not married.
[time=1830] That man was considered to be in sin.
[time=1833] One Jewish encyclopedia on this says this.
[time=1837] One who is without a wife is without joy, without blessing, without happiness, without learning, without protection, without peace.
[time=1846] Indeed he is no man. For it is written quote from Genesis 5, male and female created he them and called their name man.
[time=1854] The quote goes on. He who is not married is as it were guilty of bloodshed and deserves death.
[time=1860] He causes the image of God to be diminished and the divine presence to withdraw from Israel.
[time=1865] That gives you an idea of how strongly that message was being preached in the nation of Israel.
[time=1869] You've got to get married and you've got to get married by 18 or 20 or you're in sin.
[time=1873] All of that they thought tied to the fact that they needed to procreate the earth.
[time=1878] In fact the Jews had a list of the seven kinds of people most despicable or unacceptable to God.
[time=1885] At the top of the list of the seven kinds of people a Jew who had no wife.
[time=1889] Number two a Jewish person who had no children.
[time=1892] And so there was an enormous kind of pressure put upon the single people that they had to get married otherwise they were in sin.
[time=1899] And Paul is saying the opposite. Chapter seven verse one it is good.
[time=1903] It is good for a man not to touch a woman is good to be single.
[time=1907] And the attitude among Christians today is not entirely unlike the attitude of that Jewish culture.
[time=1913] Which looks on single people in some way as a second class citizen a second class condition and they are then that totally frustrated.
[time=1922] From messages like mine in the last couple of series where we really start to talk about the woman's role and we try to exalt that particular part of what God has to say about that.
[time=1931] If those messages go left unbalanced then the whole community and the singles themselves can feel unappreciated and unwanted and in some way second class and out of God's design.
[time=1942] Singles listen to messages that state the three great goals of life to be master, mission and mate and if they don't have all three then somehow they are not spiritually mature or they haven't yet arrived.
[time=1952] We go beyond those kinds of things to just the larger Christian community and we see that the preponderance of attention is given to the married couple and the married people.
[time=1961] Myriads of books, magazines, articles, conferences and programs focus on biblical standards for marriage and much much much less is given in attention to the single people.
[time=1972] And the material that is written to the single people somehow seems to carry the connotation of how single people can cope with being single.
[time=1979] As if to say they're not quite normal or the state of being single is not desirable.
[time=1984] They also have to face the well-intending comments as their married friends will offer sympathies and somehow walk away with a feeling that they're only half complete 50% until they're married and then afterwards when they're married they're finally a full-fledged bona fide person and they're worth 100%.
[time=2001] But Paul in defending this the idea of singleness in verse one says very clearly it is good for a man not to touch a woman and right away with this statement he takes the pressure off of the line of thought that there is a greater level of spirituality to be had by being married.
[time=2019] He also takes the line of thought away that there is a greater level of spirituality by not having physical intimacy he does away with both of those concepts and tries to return his back to a balanced perspective on the issue.
[time=2034] He says it is good to be single if you're a bachelor that's good if you're a single woman that's good if you're a widow or a widower that's good.
[time=2047] He says after all I'm single and I'm not looking for a wife look at it again verse seven yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am well what was that well he was single.
[time=2059] However each man has his own gift from God one in this manner and another in that but I say to the unmarried and the widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I.
[time=2067] Now we can't prove it but we believe that Paul was married he was a member of the Sanhedrin and a requirement for that was to be married.
[time=2074] He came up through the Hebrew system in fact Philippians three calls him Hebrew Hebrews in other words he says in their I fulfilled all the regulations and rules that I should as a young Jewish boy.
[time=2083] I was zell it with respect to the law the law meaning not just the law of God but the tradition that they built on top of that and so it's highly probable that Paul was married.
[time=2092] What happened to his wife we don't know the Bible doesn't tell us she it's unlikely that they would have been divorced but it is more probable that he was a widower and so he says look I wish you could all be like me.
[time=2103] I'm single it's fantastic I can serve the Lord in some very unique and wonderful ways but he doesn't say we all have to be single he doesn't degrade the institution of marriage.
[time=2114] Look at verse seven again yet I wish that all men were even as I myself however each man has his own gift from God one in this manner and another in that in other words it's been given to some of us to be married and it's been given to some of us not to be married.
[time=2129] It's not for all believers to be married that's not for all believers to be single.
[time=2134] So marriage was instituted by God and in fact is the norm for men and women relationships and it is a great blessing to mankind but it is not required for believers or for anyone else.
[time=2147] His point is if you are single that is good and if you are married or get married that is good but spirituality is not determined by the marital status.
[time=2155] To be single is not to be caught in some type of social purgatory.
[time=2160] God himself declared at creation that it is not good for the man to live alone I will make him a helper suitable for him and we were created for that purpose.
[time=2168] God ordained marriage to be among other things the most fulfilling and common means of companionship but there is this idea of the gift of singleness that God has given to individuals which allows them to live without marriage.
[time=2184] So in that Paul defends singleness now let's see singleness defined what is the gift of singleness verse seven again.
[time=2193] He refers there to the gift however each man has his own gift charisma in the Greek it talks about endowment or ability spiritual privilege the special endowment of grace that makes a person equipped to live in a particular way.
[time=2210] And what Paul is saying is that God has gifted some individuals with spiritual gift or grace the endowment to live outside of the companionship of marriage.
[time=2222] And that makes sense with the rest of what we know about scripture as we just said what is normative for most people who live on the face of the earth by virtue of the way they were created it is to join one another in the unity and the bonds of marriage.
[time=2235] The whole thing is really relational God is a relational being and God has given to us relational capacity and are being created in his image and what is normal and natural and typical is for people to enjoy the harmony of that relational
[time=2251] capacity in the commitment and in the bonds of marriage but he says he has given special gift he has given special endowment special ability to some who do not need that kind of intimacy.
[time=2264] They can live without it they have that gift they can move beyond the intimacy of marriage.
[time=2272] Now we'll talk more about that in a minute but I want to move to point three to be diagnosed how do I know if I'm that person how am I supposed to understand if I really do have the singleness or how should I interact with my child who is now 28 years old and over whom I think hypothetically of course
[time=2288] how do I interact with my child and what how do I know if they have that particular gift that God has given them and the answer to that is found in verse nine.
[time=2297] He says if they do not have self-control let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn.
[time=2302] This but is in contrast to what he said in verse eight saying I wish you all could be married I wish you could all remain even as I am I wish you could all be single but if you don't have self-control then marry for it is better to marry than to burn.
[time=2317] Well what does that stuff mean self-control it's a word in the middle voice meaning that you can control yourself you put this action on yourself you know how to control yourself.
[time=2326] It refers to a person's power over their own being to hold oneself in and to control oneself to be inwardly strong.
[time=2335] The same word is used in 1 Corinthians 9 when Paul is talking about the athlete who would compete in the games in order to do that he must be able to exercise self-control.
[time=2344] In other words to be involved in the training process and equipping for such an incredible event a man who does not have self-control will never be ready for an event like that and he'll be destroyed by everybody else who does.
[time=2355] So it is this ability to have self-control and in our context it means with respect to our passions the physical allurements the desire for the physical intimacy of marriage.
[time=2367] People who have been given the gift of singleness have an ability to control that in their life which is different from people who don't.
[time=2376] It says again in verse 9 for it is better to marry than to burn and this burn is written in the present tense indicating it's a continual problem it's the condition of burning it's that continuing to burn inside of me it's that continued state of being inflamed.
[time=2392] It means to be in this context to be deeply desirous of that physical intimacy to the point that I am utterly distracted by it and want it and can't think about the rest of my duties and the rest of my responsibilities.
[time=2406] I can't really in good conscience set another course in life that would leave me utterly away from that kind of intimacy because I don't have that kind of self-control and I don't have that freedom I've got this thing inside of me that is just calling me and longing for me to have that.
[time=2419] It describes the emotions 2 Corinthians 11 29 Paul says who has led into sin without my intense concern same word there.
[time=2428] When Paul would see some of his beloved brethren in the Lord fall into sin it would just drive him nuts inside he would be so concerned about it and he would write letters and he'd go visit it and he'd move into their life and he'd call him back to holiness he was distracted by it it consumed his thinking when people would fall into sin.
[time=2445] Many many many of the books of the New Testament are written in response to error in the church.
[time=2450] That's the idea figuratively in this passage it talks about sexual desire.
[time=2455] Now the word could mean to burn in Gehenna hell this doesn't have any this word burned doesn't have any particularly sexual connotations in and of itself.
[time=2465] I mean it could be the kind of burning that happens when people go to hell but that seems really far-fetched to me because there's no mention of hell here.
[time=2472] If that is the case then these people who is writing have to be unbelievers and they have to be habitually practicing this sexual problem.
[time=2481] I believe instead it's much more natural to understand that this is the description of the inner emotion the longing the unfulfilled desires that man I wasn't created to be single where is my mate that kind of feeling that burning.
[time=2498] Paul is concerned about that in those people those people who do not have self-control and who have that continual burning going on within them because as you look at verse two Corinth had a multiple of opportunities for the illicit expression of that desire.
[time=2512] But because of immorality let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband he puts that word immorality in the plural to describe the various and sundry opportunities for illicit sex in the city of Corinth.
[time=2525] Corinth was the vice capital of the world being on the seaport of the Mediterranean and the Aegean seas and all the people who had commerce in and through there and they would bring with them all of the things of the world and the deviant sexual practices and like most port cities even today it was full of sin and vice.
[time=2542] It had there the temple Aphrodite which had 1000 female temple prostitutes who would service the people of the city in their religious worship if you will.
[time=2552] In fact the verb to Corinthianize when you take the city's name Corinth and make it a verb became synonymous with having sex with a prostitute so they were wildly famous even as a city as a characterization of all the people therein for their illicit practices.
[time=2568] And so he's talking to these people who write him out of concern what about me I'm single I don't know where I fit how do I work this all out and what he is saying is it is good to be single if you are morally pure and it is good to be single if God has given you this special ability to live as a single person.
[time=2585] How do I know if I have it you'll know if you have it because you have a level of self control and there will be a cessation of the burning within you for the intimacy of marriage and it's better for you to do that than to fall into these various sexual immoralities that are presented to you in your city.
[time=2602] So Paul of course is not encouraging marriage for the purpose of diffusing the sexual appetites alone.
[time=2609] He is not saying that if you can't control yourself and you just have these huge enormous physical appetites then get married.
[time=2616] That's not the idea of marriage I mean we don't understand that from anywhere in the scriptures.
[time=2620] Marriage is to be a bond really a partnership for the gospel of Jesus Christ that is entered into by two believing people who are in love with each other and want to sacrificially love the other for the rest of their life.
[time=2631] And it goes a whole lot deeper than the sexual issue.
[time=2635] He is saying that the one who possesses the gift of singleness will reach a place of contentment without the intimacy of marriage.
[time=2643] People who do not experience that dynamic in their life people who are not able to reach a tolerable level of cessation of this kind of desire should be worn you probably don't have that gift.
[time=2655] And don't let anybody try to make you take a vow towards that gift in response to this heretical teaching that there was some higher level of spirituality from total abstinence from the intimate entomacies of marriage.
[time=2668] Now I want to go a little further with this by saying that when he is talking about the self-control there in verse nine and the idea that you would not burn in verse nine he is not just on a physical level.
[time=2681] This is not just talking about physical sexual things.
[time=2687] That may be the most prominent.
[time=2689] That may be the easiest to read.
[time=2691] That may be the strongest thing you experience about yourself if you don't have the gift of singleness.
[time=2697] But obviously he is talking about the spiritual, intellectual and emotional entomacies of marriage as well as the physical entomacies of marriage.
[time=2706] Which will if you have that gift be best evidenced by the fact that you can control your physical desires.
[time=2712] And that may sound strange and odd to those of us who don't have that gift.
[time=2716] But there are actually people who have the gift of singleness who don't have that burning, distracting, preoccupying consuming desire to be intimate spiritually, emotionally, mentally and physically with another person.
[time=2733] It's not that they're not aware that that exists.
[time=2736] It's not that they are absolutely void of any sexual feelings at all.
[time=2740] It's not that they can't look at a marriage and say, man, look at the friendship that goes on there.
[time=2744] Look at the love and the support.
[time=2746] Look at how they serve each other.
[time=2748] And in some way at least recognize and in a sense desire that people with the gift of singleness, they can see all that in the same way that you and I who don't have that gift can look at a single person and say, man, look at the relative simplicity of their life.
[time=2762] Look at the situation that they have and we remember back when we were single and we didn't have a wife and four kids and all the bills and all the responsibilities that come with that and the ability to structure our time a little bit differently.
[time=2774] So it's not that we aren't aware of each other's state, but those who have the gift of singleness find a level of cessation of that desire for the spiritual, intellectual and emotional and physical intimacy that allows them to lead an undistracted life.
[time=2791] They are not preoccupied. They are not consumed by that.
[time=2794] And there is a freedom in their heart to set a course other than marriage.
[time=2797] They can pursue a career or they can pursue a missions opportunity or they can pursue this without something inside of them screaming, no, no, no, that's not who you are.
[time=2805] That's not what God has called you to do.
[time=2807] You have desires that are different than that.
[time=2810] Maybe just by way of illustrating that we could think about another gift like the gift of teaching.
[time=2815] And if we were to take two of you, one who is gifted at teaching and one who is not gifted at teaching and assuming that both of you had had no previous experience and take you into a 12-week course on teaching, homiletics and hermeneutics
[time=2828] and preparing your sermons and studying and looking and then putting it into a package and then practicing it.
[time=2833] And each person got 12 opportunities, let's say, to preach that.
[time=2837] At the end of that session, one of those people is going to say, "Man, where are the people? Let me preach. Let me talk. Let me teach.
[time=2843] This is what I feel good in that forum. When I get up in front of people and I begin to articulate what I think God has to say, there's a level of comfort.
[time=2850] Now, I may not be as good as I want to be at that or I may not see the kind of response I want, but intrinsically I feel like, "Yeah, something works there."
[time=2858] And that other person who doesn't have that gift is going to go, "That's the last thing on God's green earth I ever want to do again.
[time=2865] I don't want to be up front. I don't want to be having to talk in front of people. I get nervous. I get sweaty palms. I'd rather die than get up in front."
[time=2872] So there is an internal difference in those people by virtue of divine enablement.
[time=2877] And that's really all he's saying. People who have been given a divine enablement to be single, though they are aware of the other dimension, they aren't compelled to it or consumed by it or so preoccupied by it that they can't pursue in other course.
[time=2896] So Paul defends singleness. Paul defends singleness. He says that there is a place for people to be single.
[time=2905] There is a place and it is in fact a good place. It is the place that I am in. It is the place that allows me to perform levels of ministry that I could never otherwise perform.
[time=2916] And so he puts the kabosh on people that want to say, "We all have to get married." And he puts the kabosh at the same time on saying that there is some higher level of spirituality in this state of singleness or sexual abstinence.
[time=2929] And that's clear by virtue of his instructions in verses 3, 4, and 5 to those who are married.
[time=2935] He also goes on then to define it at some level. He says it is divine enablement. It is a grace gift. It is something which God gives to people.
[time=2944] And which they are able to enjoy and fruitfully pursue in their life. And then he gives us some help to diagnose it. How do I know if I have it? How do I know if my son or daughter has it?
[time=2954] Well, in some discussions about what goes on in the inner man inside that person, if you find there that there is a level of comfortability and a freedom from that longing for the intimacies, again the full broad depth of those intimacies, then you may be dealing with somebody who has been given the gift of singleness.
[time=2973] So as we wrap it up this morning, let me try to make a few points of application. One. And this really is directed to those of us who are married.
[time=2984] For those of us who are married and in the habit of playing Cupid, this role may be very appreciated by some of your single friends. In fact, they may be twisting your arm to work a little harder as Cupid.
[time=2999] But there may be another group of people in your life and in our church for whom this kind of activity is not helpful. It is in fact detrimental. It is unhealthy.
[time=3010] Because in that role, that pressure or that pushing, they find themselves being moved into a role that God has not called them to or gifted them to.
[time=3021] And instead, my counsel to we who are married and concerned about the blessings that God has given us in our singles, we need to be sensitive and aware of this gift and aware that Paul says it's good and treat each one of them on a very individual basis
[time=3038] and entering into some level of conversation. And I'm trying to understand them before we come off with the kind of glib comments which oftentimes produce pressure in their life.
[time=3051] For those of you who are single, let me suggest a few things. First, just as it is wrong to misuse a gift that we have.
[time=3064] To misuse a gift that we have, and you can think a lot about that with respect to Corinthian chapter 12 and the misuse of gifts that was going on in the church.
[time=3071] It is equally detrimental to try to use a gift we don't have.
[time=3078] Obviously, we live in a day in our culture in America where singleness is on the rise. Singleness is very popular. Singleness is kind of in vogue.
[time=3090] And you would want to identify that pressure in the world and look at it and evaluate it and say to yourself, I don't want to be walking down the wrong path just because that seems to be popular at this point in time in the culture.
[time=3105] It can bring tremendous moral and spiritual frustration to try to use a gift you do not have.
[time=3112] And sometimes single people will oftentimes provoked by the pressure that comes from the pulpit or from well-intending married friends and from the culture itself say that they have the gift of singleness just to put everybody at arms length.
[time=3126] And then begin to talk themselves into it because it's a safer place to be. And I would encourage you to reevaluate that if in fact you do not have that self-control and that cessation of burning to the place that there is a contentment in your life.
[time=3139] I mean, a genuine contentment where you and your best friends talk about those kinds of things.
[time=3144] If that's not the case, you need to be open and honest with yourself and vulnerable before God and say, you know, my desire really is to be married, even though it's hard to say that and hard to be known as such.
[time=3155] And I don't think you have to broadcast that, but in your own heart there needs to be a willingness to acknowledge that and to trust God and to allow him to meet that need in his own timing and his own way.
[time=3166] Secondly, there is nothing to say that a person doesn't start with the gift of singleness and then somebody comes into their life and snatches that away from them.
[time=3177] In other words, I thought I was content and I thought this whole thing was tolerable until I met her and now I can't live without her.
[time=3185] And it's also not to say that a person can't be married and in that way saying, I don't have the gift of singleness and then something happened, a death or a divorce or something like that and then have the rest of their life experience the gift of singleness.
[time=3198] Paul would indeed be an example of that very thing if in fact he was married at one time and he says, I wish you were as I am.
[time=3204] The probability then would be that he was married for a time, something happened, he's no longer married.
[time=3209] So at one point he seemed to be needing that marriage and another point he says, no, I have the gift of singleness, I'm okay without it.
[time=3218] Thirdly, the fact that you as a single person may not have the gift of singleness.
[time=3225] You do not have a cessation of that longing for that kind of intimacy is in no way a justification for immorality.
[time=3237] And this is remarkably worldly. I mean, this is remarkably Vogue. This is very much in style.
[time=3244] And we do watch the singles, many of them unbelieving, but in my experience with a lot of singles, both at the Masters College and at Grace Community Church where I had some ministry with them, I have found it creeps into the church as well and the people are enjoying the freedom not having to make the commitment of marriage,
[time=3263] not having to be strapped down with the responsibilities and the long-term nature of marriage, but still there is that desire and it's being satisfied with an ordinate, emotional dependency,
[time=3274] both on the different sex and same sex, it is being satisfied with an ordinate amount of physical relationships, sometimes falling all the way to fornication.
[time=3285] And all I'm saying is that if you don't have the gift of singleness, then it's right and normal for there to be a battle for the self-control and the burning will not necessarily decrease or go away just because you're in the word more now than you were before or you memorized a few verses.
[time=3300] But that is not a justification to go out and gratify that particular dimension of that desire.
[time=3307] God has called you to purity, God has called you to righteousness, and though He may have placed in you desires that He is not yet fulfilling, He has given you the strength and the resources to obey Him as you wait for that.
[time=3325] And then lastly, for all of us, there's a lot more to be said on singleness. And we've only got one message going here, and you could walk away with some preconceived ideas of what I actually mean or what I'm actually trying to say.
[time=3338] And I want you to know that we're next week going to come back and begin by looking at verses 25 to 38 of 1 Corinthians, which talks about what's so good about being single. He'll describe and explain his answer a little more thoroughly.
[time=3351] And then that'll kind of conclude that part on the bliss of being single, and then we'll move to the blisters of being singles. And they're really spent some time talking to those who don't have the gift of singleness and are struggling deeply with that longing to be single and how to handle that in their life.
[time=3371] So, let me encourage you to hold from jumping to any preconceived conclusions about where we're actually going to end up or where we're going to go.
[time=3401] I hope that God has blessed you today through the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir, the handbell choir, and soloist Kevin Rowe. The message was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
