[time=0] So we're talking about singles. People who do not have the gift of singleness, people who were designed by God to be enjoying the intimacy of marriage,
[time=11] but by His plan are not in the intimacy of that union. And the struggle that is
[time=17] theirs to groan under the weight of their loneliness and the sense of longing that they have for more in their life and how to handle that. And Paul says that they are to groan or to sigh, to fully experience the disappointment that fills their life.
[time=35] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we
[time=50] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Today, Pastor Moore continues his series on singles. Today's message is the fourth in the series, which he has entitled "The Bliss and Blisters of Singleness."
[time=65] The Apostle Paul uses the word groan to describe the expected response of individuals who are living in a state of singleness. Just what does that mean? Stay with us as we look at biblical instruction in this very important area.
[time=79] Today's message is from First Corinthians. Our special music today will include
[time=86] our sanctuary choir land orchestra with a song entitled "My Faith is Found a Resting Place" and Lynn Roll singing "It Must Be Love." As we prepare for our time of
[time=100] Bible study, let's listen to Bill layman singing "Jesus Medley."
[time=109] In the very thought of Jesus, his presence can be found. He's as close as the
[time=132] mention of his name. There is never any distance between my Lord and me. He's as
[time=145] close as the mention of his name. He's as close as the mention of his name. Jesus,
[time=169] Jesus, he's as close as the mention of his name. Jesus, Jesus, he's as close as the mention
[time=194] of his name. Jesus, Jesus, he's as close as the mention of his name.
[time=214] Jesus, Jesus. There is a name my love to explore.
[time=241] Any time of day would die. And all the peace that accompanies its mention.
[time=259] No tongue can tell nor pen can run with spur Jesus.
[time=276] My love, Jesus, heaven's peace would flood your soul.
[time=323] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. There's just something about the name.
[time=341] Jesus, Jesus, like the fragrance after the rain.
[time=360] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Let all heaven nurse proclaim.
[time=378] Kings and kingdoms will pass away, but there's something in our part that may.
[time=398] God, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[time=428] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=454] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[time=499] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=515] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[time=610] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
[time=650] "Well good morning and welcome to the Bible hour. We're so thankful that you've tuned in to view our ministry today and we trust that God is at work."
[time=680] We're working your life, that you're experiencing his love and his leadership in your life.
[time=685] As you know we've been doing a series on being single, the bliss and blisters of being single, and we're coming to the end of that series and we're focusing in on some of the blisters of being single and some of the hardships that a single person can encounter in today's world.
[time=701] Of course one of those is being single by virtue of being divorced, and that can be a very, very traumatic experience.
[time=709] I'm a person's life and I'm so thankful that we have a man in our church by the name of Tom Leach.
[time=714] Good morning, Tom.
[time=716] And Tom is giving leadership to a ministry in our church to divorce people.
[time=721] Tom, why don't you tell us a little bit about that?
[time=723] Well, Black Hawk offers I think a very special program here for the people that are in the pain of divorce.
[time=730] It's overwhelming for the number of people that come through, both Christian and non-Christian.
[time=736] But when someone's in that pain, that they find themselves very confused.
[time=743] Their emotions run from hostility to hopelessness, and it's kind of like you're in a maze and you don't know where you're going.
[time=749] You just keep hitting these dead-end roads and you're looking for a way out.
[time=753] And many people can't find the way out.
[time=757] It's an emotional-less maze that you're in.
[time=763] Here at Black Hawk, we offer a program called Divorce Recovery Workshops.
[time=767] And we give people the capability to find the hope and the way out of that maze.
[time=772] That's what we do.
[time=773] If I were to come to one of those, I mean, is it seven consecutive Friday nights?
[time=778] Yes, it is.
[time=779] And what would my experience be like the first night?
[time=782] What would happen?
[time=783] It'd probably be quite fearful like most people that come through.
[time=786] But the program each night is in two parts.
[time=790] We have a different topic that family counselor, Doug Pearson, which is also a member of the church here.
[time=797] He'll give about an hour, hour and a half lecture.
[time=799] And then we break off into support groups.
[time=800] And that's where the healing really starts to begin.
[time=802] You're broken down into groups of maybe 10 or 12 people.
[time=805] And you're with that same group through the whole program.
[time=808] And you have a facilitator that's divorced and has gone through the healing process and understands those shoes that you're walking in right now.
[time=816] And the confusion that you have.
[time=818] And they'll talk about how Christ has worked in their lives and help you to understand all those different motions.
[time=826] And that happens each night with a different topic as you progress through that healing process.
[time=831] You don't leave after seven weeks totally healed.
[time=835] That takes a lot longer than that.
[time=837] I wish it could happen in seven weeks.
[time=839] But you're on the path.
[time=842] You at least feel like you're working your way out of the maze and you can see the opening.
[time=849] It's just working towards it.
[time=851] Do I have to be a Christian to come?
[time=853] Oh, no.
[time=854] No.
[time=855] A lot of people that come through, even the Christians, are not sure of where they're at with God at the time.
[time=862] Most of the people that I've seen will do one of two things.
[time=865] They'll either turn towards God or they're going to turn away one or the other.
[time=870] And even the ones that turn towards God have a lot of questions.
[time=873] A lot of confusion because their emotions are in such a turmoil.
[time=877] They're questioning a lot.
[time=879] Unbelievable.
[time=880] The trauma that happens when the unity of marriage is ripped apart and you're left there kind of holding the bag one or who you are, I guess.
[time=887] Oh, definitely.
[time=888] Definitely.
[time=889] Many Christians feel because they are Christian.
[time=892] Their marriages have a wallop that will keep divorce from ever being a part of their life.
[time=899] And that is not true.
[time=901] And when the Christian has that happen in their life, they're very devastated.
[time=907] Tom, what are the dates of the upcoming recovery workshops and how can I sign up if I'm interested in that?
[time=913] We're starting another workshop, February 21st.
[time=916] And that runs for seven consecutive Fridays through April 3rd.
[time=921] The time of the workshop is from seven to nine thirty, approximately.
[time=926] And what you would need to do would be to call the church and get a registration form.
[time=930] Or even if you don't do that, is there's a shop there on the 21st at about six thirty so we can get you registered in.
[time=939] Okay, fantastic.
[time=940] Well, thank you.
[time=941] Thank you for your ministry in this.
[time=943] We really want to encourage those of you who might have just recently gone through a divorce or even in your past.
[time=948] If things are unsettled in your heart, give us a call at the church.
[time=951] Our number is 493 7400 493 7400 and we'll put you in contact with Tom and you can become a part of this ministry.
[time=960] You might also have a loved one or a friend that has gone through a divorce.
[time=964] Please recommend us to them.
[time=967] We'd love to get in contact and be a part of their healing process.
[time=972] And along these lines, we want you to know that we have a booklet for you that we want to make available to you.
[time=978] It's about relationships. It's written by a lady by the name of Pamela Reeve.
[time=983] And it's an excellent little help in examining the quality of your relationships.
[time=987] Whether you're married or not married or you're married and you've been divorced.
[time=992] We'd like to send it to you if you'll just write to us at the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1000] That's the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=1007] And of course, we want to send that to you free of charge.
[time=1010] We hope that you'll order it, that you'll read it, that it'll encourage you and spur you on to faith and good work as you pursue to love God with all your heart and love your neighbor as yourself.
[time=1020] Well, at this time, let's go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our ministry.
[time=1024] I want to thank you again for being with us and hope that this time together provokes you to worship God.
[time=1037] [MUSIC]
[time=1047] Why would you, the God of greatness, simply love someone like me?
[time=1057] And how could you, so pure and perfect?
[time=1064] No, my thoughts yet meet my needs.
[time=1069] I'll never know or understand just what you see in me.
[time=1080] My mind is amazed to think your plan includes me for eternity.
[time=1093] It must be love.
[time=1106] In spite of who I am, Lord, you came to where I was.
[time=1116] Although my life's been torn in scarred, there's room for me inside your heart.
[time=1127] I find no other reason than this one.
[time=1133] It must be love.
[time=1140] [MUSIC]
[time=1144] You keep turning my curses into blessings.
[time=1150] That's your love and nothing else.
[time=1154] For giving my sins and then forgetting.
[time=1158] That's your love and nothing less.
[time=1162] If I could give my everything, it wouldn't be enough.
[time=1170] For every good and perfect gift is more than I deserve.
[time=1182] It must be love.
[time=1195] In spite of who I am, Lord, you came to where I was.
[time=1204] Although my life's been torn in scarred, there's room for me inside your heart.
[time=1211] In your heart, I can find no other reason but this one.
[time=1230] It must be your love.
[time=1260] Amen, thank you, Lynn.
[time=1264] There's no other way to explain it, is there?
[time=1266] Why Jesus Christ would love people like you, people like me, other than his love, and the things that he wants to give to us in that love.
[time=1276] Well, we come this morning to our last message on Singleness, and we will wrap this up in a timely and appropriate manner.
[time=1284] Next week, I will not be here with you, I'll be speaking at a missions conference in Arizona, and we've been given the opportunity to address a church there that's in a three or four week long missions conference, and I'm one of the speakers that's coming.
[time=1299] And I'll ask your prayers, even this week that the Lord would continue to burden my heart with the things that he would have me to say to that group of people, and also that you'll be praying for Jim Pearson who will be standing in my stead next Sunday, and we're looking forward to that.
[time=1313] But what we'll do is we'll finish up on Singleness today, and then when I come back, not next Lord's Day, but the week after that, we'll jump back into our study of 1st Timothy, and we'll begin in chapter 3, where we'll begin to discuss qualifications of elders, and the whole priority of leadership that God has given to the church.
[time=1334] But today as we focus back on singles, and as you remember where we left off last week, the groaning of singles, and the hardship that is theirs to live without a life mate when they have not been given that gift.
[time=1347] I ran across an interesting little scenario or a vignette of a counselor and the Counselee.
[time=1353] The Counselee opens a counseling session with an urgent request, "I want to feel better quick."
[time=1360] The Christian counselor paused for a moment, then replied, "Well, I suggest you get a case of your favorite alcoholic beverage, find some cooperative women and go to the Bahamas for a month."
[time=1373] Now it was the Counselee's turn to pause. He stared at the counselor, looked puzzled, then said, "Are you a Christian?"
[time=1383] The counselor responded, "Why do you ask?" Counselee, "Well, your advice doesn't sound very biblical. Counselor, it's the best I can do, given your request.
[time=1396] If you really want to feel good right away and get rid of any unpleasant emotion, then I don't recommend following Christ.
[time=1403] Drunkenness, immoral pleasures, vacations will work far better. Not for long, of course, but in the short run, they'll give you what you want."
[time=1412] That's interesting, isn't it? I've often wanted to respond the exact same way to people who come into my office.
[time=1418] And in essence, say, "I've been screwing up my life for the last 25 years. Now you tell me something I can do that makes me feel good now."
[time=1425] Well, I go with the counselor. Get your favorite booze, some women, and take a vacation. I can't fix your problem, and really neither can you.
[time=1435] And I would broaden it, even beyond that. Let me read a familiar passage.
[time=1440] Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.
[time=1451] For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it. Whoever loses his life for my sake shall find it."
[time=1459] We can look at a number of different places in the book of Matthew alone where Jesus is calling men to follow him.
[time=1466] And none of those scenarios describes immediate quick relief of unpleasantries.
[time=1472] In fact, he invites them to an entire life of self-denial, of taking up the cross, of living for someone else, of giving your life away.
[time=1482] And where we get the notion that as Christians, maybe it's because we live in this day and age where everything seems painless,
[time=1489] and where there seem to be no consequences to choices and decisions.
[time=1493] But where we get the notion that if we will just follow Christ in a particular way, in a certain way, if we'll just get right with God,
[time=1500] if we'll just line our life up perfectly with the Word of God, there'll be this painless bliss, and we'll just kind of waltz through life
[time=1507] from one mountaintop experience to another until we wake up in heaven, and it's just been glorious, wonderful bliss all of our life.
[time=1514] Man, I don't know where that comes from.
[time=1516] It comes a lot over the Christian airways. It comes a lot in various peoples preaching.
[time=1521] I don't see it in the Bible, and I don't see it in the life of Jesus Christ Himself.
[time=1527] He came unto His own, and His own received Him not, the very people who came to save His own kinsmen, they crucified Him.
[time=1533] We see over and over in His life the trauma of people disappointing Him and rejecting Him and betraying Him,
[time=1540] and He retreats in the anguish of His soul to all night prayer sessions with God the Father, whereby He sustains His strength to live a godly and obedient life.
[time=1550] We find Jesus over and over and over again in the Scriptures weeping over the personal trauma of the people around Him and the sin and the eventuality of the cross.
[time=1561] It is not as if Jesus has just fixed His eyes on the resurrection and then somehow has become immune to all the pain that He went through in the 33-plus years of His life.
[time=1572] Jesus embraced the reality of His life, and it was hard at times.
[time=1577] Philippians 1, "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake not only to believe in Him, but what, but to suffer for His sake."
[time=1586] This wasn't just for Jesus, this wasn't just for the God-man to suffer and to live this life of service and commitment that led to personal pain and discomfort.
[time=1597] It's for you, it's for me, 1 Peter 4.
[time=1600] Do not be surprised at the fire your deal among you which comes upon you for your testing as though some strange thing were happening to you,
[time=1608] but to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ keep on rejoicing.
[time=1612] And by the way, I don't mean to paint the Christian as some mopey, dopey, depressed person who walks around just with this bad attitude because life is so horrible.
[time=1621] I don't see Jesus living that kind of life and I certainly don't see that in the life of Paul, but what I see in both of them is a kind of approach to life that really is honest about what life consists of and embraces that and lives with purpose and meaning in the middle and through that.
[time=1637] And that's what I want to call our singles to as I want to call the rest of us.
[time=1641] For those of you who might be joining us, we are midway near the close of a four-part series on being single.
[time=1648] And we are not saying that it is bad to be single.
[time=1651] In fact, we looked at 1 Corinthians chapter 7, which is kind of the primary passage in the Bible on singleness and found Paul saying there that it is good to be for a man not to touch a woman, which is just a euphemistic way of saying that it's good to be single.
[time=1664] Paul affirms being single. Paul affirms single people. Paul is not trying to wrap everybody up in the same package and say that everybody has to be married or they're in sin or they're out of God's will or something is terribly wrong with them.
[time=1675] In fact, he goes on to say that there is a thing called a gift of singleness or divine enablement that allows people, people who have been given this gift, to live without a marriage partner.
[time=1686] As most of us were built and designed to do, God has given some a gift or an ability to live without the intimacy of marriage, not just physical intimacy, but emotional, spiritual, relational intimacy.
[time=1697] And he has even helped in that chapter those people to diagnose whether or not they have that gift by the ability of self-control and the burning thing that has been reached a level of cessation.
[time=1708] In other words, they're okay without marriage and they can make other plans and they can chart a life course that is outside of marriage and they have a piece about that and there is a sense of being okay inside and they can pursue that.
[time=1721] He says it's good to be single because there are freedoms that single people enjoy to serve Christ in some unique ways that married people don't enjoy.
[time=1730] Freedom to suffer in difficult assignments, freedom to seize the limited opportunities, freedom to serve Christ with undistracted devotion, not being distracted by the cares of a spouse and a house and all the things that go with children and all the rest.
[time=1744] So for some it is a good thing to be single and we affirm that and we say to the singles in this church, we're thankful for you and for your presence.
[time=1753] Whether you have the gift of singleness or not, but there is the reality for those of you who do not have that gift, you were built for marriage, you were built for the intimacy of a marriage relationship and for some reason God has not allowed you to have that and it hurts.
[time=1768] The blisters of being single. Those of you who are in that category must learn to wait on God in the midst of your painful hurt and really this is a reminder to all of us, even we who are married because all of us are experiencing that to one degree or another.
[time=1787] We are waiting for something, a husband to stop drinking, a more intimate marital relationship, a medical report that says the tissue is benign, a better job, more money and a strange son coming home, a rebellious daughter straightening out, a husband or a wife or a relative
[time=1802] or a child that would come to Christ or some business situation that is raking you over the coals and you want relief and you pray for relief and it doesn't come.
[time=1810] All of us have situations and circumstances in our life to one degree or another which remind us constantly that we are fallen people living in a fallen world.
[time=1822] And we are all called to do what Paul did and would you come there with me to Romans 8? Romans 8, Paul gives some very unpopular advice in that he calls us to groan, G-R-O-A-N groan.
[time=1844] He's saying in verse 22, Romans 8 that not only does creation groan and suffer the pains of childbirth, in other words, this thing that was created perfect by God has now been cursed under the curse of sin and it too groans for its redemption.
[time=1859] But verse 23, not only this, but also we ourselves having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves.
[time=1869] There is even in the life of the Apostle Paul, a godly man, a man who sought Christ with all of his heart, mind, soul and strength who received most of the revelation out of which the New Testament has been written this, really this primary example of human spirituality, the Apostle Paul talks about his own life and says I groan.
[time=1888] He emphasizes that further over in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 4 where he talks about groaning and being burdened by his life and wishing that he was clothed with immortality, in other words wishing his life was over, wishing he was already in heaven.
[time=1901] So this is not just for Christ and this is not just for people who are in sin, this is for people like Paul who are the paragon of spirituality.
[time=1911] And what it says to us is that there is really no way to escape the reality of life.
[time=1918] We are fallen people living in a fallen world and as nice as we have it, there are still disappointments and there are still hurts.
[time=1925] And it's interesting that Paul doesn't call us to focus on those hurts and to be immobilized by those hurts and to become of no value at all because we're just overwhelmed by our disappointments, but he doesn't say to pretend they're not there either.
[time=1937] He says embrace them, groan under them, the word means to sigh, just to sigh, life is hard.
[time=1944] Life isn't how it was supposed to be created to live in the Garden of Eden in perfect circumstances, this is far from that.
[time=1952] You can say to your husband he's far from Adam and say to your wife she is far from Eve.
[time=1958] Children are oftentimes difficult and rebellious and there's confusion as to how to handle that and none of that would have been the case in the Garden of Eden.
[time=1967] So we groan and we are wise to groan, we are wise to understand that we are to let that impact us, why?
[time=1976] Why? Well he finishes his thought there in verse 23.
[time=1980] Even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body.
[time=1988] This is pie in the sky Christianity and this is the truth.
[time=1993] In other words what Paul is saying is that we are able to embrace the hardship of life and continue to live obediently and with purpose and not to be self-centered and to try to orchestrate our life in ways that we never have to groan because we know that one day when we are in heaven
[time=2008] everything will be as it is supposed to be.
[time=2011] All of our desires, all of our longings will be utterly and completely satisfied and in the interim we are because of that hope because we are waiting able to live a godly life, even when it hurts, even when it's disappointing.
[time=2024] Even when obedience means more disappointment and more pain because we are not without hope.
[time=2032] And what Christian teachers will often offer you are techniques or ten steps or pat answers to removing the pain to denying the pain to getting away from the pain and faith then becomes the means not to learning contentment regardless of circumstances but rather
[time=2048] faith is the means to rearrange your circumstances and to provide more comfort and that is a foreign thought to the New Testament.
[time=2056] Somehow we harbor in ourselves the erroneous belief that it is within our power to rearrange our life and secure our own relief and make us feel like we are in heaven when we are not.
[time=2070] I would suggest that Paul is saying we do otherwise.
[time=2073] I would suggest that the Bible says not just here in this verse but as we read the whole of it that is the path of righteousness, it is the path of godliness that embraces the hardship of life realizes that a better day is coming and therefore in the interim will live in obedience to God.
[time=2094] Sort of the singles in particular this morning we are saying that we implore you to encourage you, beseech you to honestly admit that you would much rather be married to admit the ache in your soul, to admit that it is hard to live this way but continue to wait on God,
[time=2116] to wait on heaven and in the interim to live an obedient and godly life and this is really the great theology of hope that encompasses all the scriptures.
[time=2126] Remember we talked about that out of the Babylonian exile experience as we looked at the prophecy of Isaiah developed and Isaiah in the early parts of his prophecy writing to these people who have been ripped out of their homeland and were taken as prisoners.
[time=2138] He says it seems as if God is hiding his face he's not hearing our prayers we don't know where he is there is no relief we are constantly bound in this persecution.
[time=2147] Later in the prophecy by about chapter 25 it develops to the point of describing the Messianic return and the salvation that Christ will bring and they speak with great joy.
[time=2157] This is the Lord for whom we have waited let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation and they begin to fix their focus on the reality that Christ is indeed coming again.
[time=2167] And then later he's still in the prophecy Isaiah chapter 40 those familiar words those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength.
[time=2175] They will mount up with wings like eagles they will run and not get tired they will walk and not become weary.
[time=2181] That strength comes not because Christ solves all their immediate problems.
[time=2185] That strength comes not because they believe if they just pray hard enough God will solve their business problems solve their marriage problems solve their problem with their children.
[time=2192] That strength comes because they know that even if he doesn't choose to do that a better day is coming and so I can live in obedience to him even though those circumstances are still raw even though those circumstances are still the way I don't want them to be even though those circumstances are still very hard.
[time=2208] So the Christian groans and out of that groaning comes awaiting and in the intro is obedience.
[time=2217] Now what does that look like for a single in particular or in specific and I want to offer three actually five things this morning that I hope will be of some help.
[time=2228] Three of them are restrictive three of them are negative two of them are positive.
[time=2234] Let's look at the first one. I believe that in a single person who is pursuing Christ in the groaning of their life yet waiting for heaven will refuse to marry an unbeliever regardless of the immediate gratification that might offer.
[time=2256] Would you come with me to 2 Corinthians? 2 Corinthians chapter 6.
[time=2262] This is about being unequally yoked about being unequally yoked.
[time=2269] In the Old Testament Deuteronomy 22-10 it says you shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.
[time=2275] In other words you don't put an ox and a donkey in the same harness. Why?
[time=2278] The step and the pull of the two animals is unequal. It won't work.
[time=2283] The Paul is saying that is true of marriage. You don't yoke. You don't put a believer and an unbeliever under the same yoke of marriage.
[time=2291] Why? Because their vision, their heart, their passion, their direction are antagonistic one to another.
[time=2297] Verse 14 2 Corinthians. Do not be bound together or yoked together with unbelievers for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness or what fellowship has light with darkness.
[time=2311] Paul is saying and this could be broader than just marriage. This could include being unequally yoked with teachers of doctrine who do not believe the same way about a particular passage or on some of the major themes of the faith.
[time=2324] But in particular it is applied to marriage. Do not be unequally yoked. A Christian is not supposed to marry an unbeliever.
[time=2332] And that gets hard when you're single. And somebody who isn't a believer walks into your life with a lot of the characteristics you've been looking for and is kind and is gracious and is generous and is available and is interested.
[time=2348] And there is then a great temptation for that Christian single person to go outside the will of God.
[time=2355] And I would suggest that that is foolishness. It is always foolishness to disobey God.
[time=2361] Whenever I read this passage I think of a young lady who went to a Christian college and was very involved in all the things going on there and began to date one of the kind of the big man on campus types.
[time=2372] He was an athlete. He was good looking. But he had only a nominal confession of faith.
[time=2378] He had to give that in order to go there and play ball.
[time=2382] And in her distraction of some of his characteristics that were so appealing she failed to really evaluate whether or not there was the love of Christ.
[time=2390] Whether or not this guy was really born again. Whether this guy was really committed to Christ. Whether he was truly saved.
[time=2397] So they got married.
[time=2399] And soon they she found out what this verse is all about as far as being unequally yoked and out of step and with a different pull and the home never really settled and the vision of the heart never really came together.
[time=2410] And his selfishness began to really accelerate as one who did not have Christ and one who would not live self sacrificially for his spouse.
[time=2418] He eventually refused to have children something he'd agreed to prior to the marriage after the marriage wasn't interested in that.
[time=2425] She had hoped for that all of her life.
[time=2429] After about ten years of marriage it became apparent that he was unfaithful to her.
[time=2433] That he was running around and yet there was no proof of that and so she didn't have biblical grounds for divorce.
[time=2439] It was just a lingering nagging suspicion and she carried the trauma of that and eventually some years later he divorced her.
[time=2449] I don't know if that would be the case in every situation.
[time=2452] I imagine there could be some examples brought of believers having married unbelievers and things went relatively well but I want to warn you most times it's not the case.
[time=2461] Most times that is not the case.
[time=2464] This poor gal infatuated steps outside the will of God.
[time=2470] Shortly after they were married she realized what she had done that he wasn't a believer and she did everything in her power to live a godly life but it was too late.
[time=2477] You can't change that stuff. She's now too old to have children and her whole life as she had hoped it just shattered.
[time=2489] Stepped outside of the will of God and added to the trauma.
[time=2496] Don't do that.
[time=2498] If somebody is in your life and they're an unbeliever and you're a believer and you're feeling yourself drawn to that person you need to find some people to hold you accountable and to help you.
[time=2510] Maybe that person will come to Christ and of course that's very difficult.
[time=2513] Should we date unbelievers?
[time=2515] The Bible doesn't say not to but you got to face the fact you're going to marry one of the people you date and if you date unbelievers you may marry one of those.
[time=2525] Gary, your emotions get going, you spend time, you give gifts, you communicate on a deep level and pretty soon your emotions are in the driver's seat and you've broken the law of God.
[time=2536] Don't do that.
[time=2537] Number two, single people who are experiencing the groaning and waiting on God will find the strength not to enter into an unbiblical remarriage.
[time=2550] You say what's that? Come to Matthew chapter 19.
[time=2555] This is hard.
[time=2560] Matthew chapter 19, the passage really runs from verse 3 to verse 12.
[time=2566] Matthew 19 verse 3, the Pharisees came testing Christ and saying is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause at all?
[time=2574] And Jesus answered and said have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh?
[time=2586] Consequently they are no longer two but one flesh.
[time=2590] What therefore God has joined together let no man separate.
[time=2593] So the Lord's first response to a question about divorce is don't you remember that this stuff is supposed to last forever?
[time=2599] The permanency of marriage is reaffirmed by our Lord. Verse 7, then they said to him well okay if it's supposed to be permanent and forever then why did Moses command to give her a certificate of divorce?
[time=2609] Which he indeed did in the Old Testament.
[time=2612] Verse 8, he said to them because of your hardness of heart Moses permitted you to divorce your wives.
[time=2618] But from the beginning it has not been this way.
[time=2621] I say to you whoever divorces his wife except for immorality and Mary's another woman commits adultery.
[time=2626] What's he saying? He's saying that in the Old Testament and he reaffirms that in the New Testament in other words for we who are in the church.
[time=2634] A biblical divorce is permissible because of the hardness of the heart of the unfaithful partner who continues to commit adultery.
[time=2642] It's not God's desire. God's desire would be in that situation for forgiveness to be granted and for that marriage to continue but he permits it.
[time=2650] It's allowable.
[time=2652] So he's saying if a divorce has occurred because of unfaithfulness on the part of that partner sexual immorality then there is grounds for divorce.
[time=2662] Look again at verse 9, I say to you whoever divorces his wife except for immorality.
[time=2668] In other words if you've got a divorce not on that ground and you marry another woman you commit adultery.
[time=2674] There is a thing called an unbiblical remarriage.
[time=2677] Some people who were married and got a divorce on unbiblical grounds are not candidates for a biblical remarriage.
[time=2686] Now it's very complicated and there are other scriptures that need to play into it and it's far too much detail to go into this morning.
[time=2692] All I'm saying is if you have had a divorce and you are thinking about remarriage you are wise to find someone to counsel you in the Word of God and to study it for yourself.
[time=2704] Well what are the grounds for a biblical remarriage and do I qualify?
[time=2708] Because if you don't qualify for you to remarry is to commit adultery is to sin.
[time=2712] It's to step outside of God's will for your life.
[time=2715] I told you these first couple ones were kind of negative.
[time=2719] And I don't get really excited about saying them either.
[time=2722] It's just that in our day and age you need to shore up our thinking about what the Bible actually says on that stuff.
[time=2729] So number three.
[time=2733] Single people need to maintain moral purity.
[time=2737] Moral purity come with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4.
[time=2742] First Thessalonians chapter 4 and this of course is really difficult for single people in the world who particularly since the 1960s and the sexual revolution are free to enjoy the intimacies of marriage without the commitment of marriage without the bonds of marriage without the I love you forever of marriage.
[time=2765] And so they have been known to move from person to person and enjoy all that physical intimacy and not support that and back that as the Word of God calls it to be done in the bonds of marriage.
[time=2777] And that happens both outside the church and in the church.
[time=2783] Verse three.
[time=2785] For this is the will of God, one of the will of God for your life that you're sanctified or you're sanctification that is that you abstain from sexual immorality.
[time=2795] Now this word in the Greek for sexual immorality is Pornea.
[time=2798] It's a very, very broad word.
[time=2800] It includes all kinds of illicit sexual activity.
[time=2803] It's broad enough to include prostitution, adultery, fornication, horrible things like bestiality, hetero or homosexuality, pitophilia.
[time=2814] It's just this huge word.
[time=2816] It's a garbage can.
[time=2818] It's the sexual garbage can word of the New Testament.
[time=2820] Pornography would be in there.
[time=2823] This is the will of God.
[time=2825] Hold yourself back.
[time=2827] The word abstain.
[time=2828] Hold yourself back from sexual immorality.
[time=2832] So many times I will counsel single people who are courting each other and who will begin to be involved in sexual immorality and they somehow say it's an expression of love.
[time=2842] They somehow say it's an expression of their commitment and they've already decided to get married so isn't it okay and all that kind of stuff.
[time=2849] You know what that really is?
[time=2850] It's not love.
[time=2851] Look at verse six.
[time=2852] It is called transgressing and defrauding your brother.
[time=2856] The word transgress means to go beyond the boundary, to exceed the proper limits.
[time=2862] You could picture it.
[time=2864] You've jumped out of your backyard and you've trespassed by jumping into somebody else's backyard.
[time=2868] You don't belong there.
[time=2869] It's private property.
[time=2870] It's posted.
[time=2871] God is posting it right here.
[time=2874] And all it does is bring trauma and devastation and destruction.
[time=2880] It doesn't bring good things.
[time=2884] Thinking about going beyond the borders.
[time=2886] We had a tremendous example of that.
[time=2888] In California we lived in a place called the Santhienes Valley and there was the Santhienes River that ran right through it and it was beautiful.
[time=2894] Beautiful river.
[time=2895] We would hunt there and fish there and it would bring all kinds of nutrients of course for the farmers.
[time=2899] It was fed by Lake Kachuma which sat up above it and all of a sudden we hit 1969 and it was just rain and more rain and rain and more rain and rain and more rain until finally the dam was going to break.
[time=2911] And so with very little notice they informed all the ranchers that were in the immediate flow or the flood path of this river.
[time=2918] It was only a couple of hours notice and it was helter, scalter and all kinds of confusion going on and they just had to let a huge amount of water out of this lake.
[time=2927] And it literally flooded the Santhienes River and over its boundaries and it began to sweep everything in its path.
[time=2933] And what was in its path were a lot of cattle ranches and Arabian horse ranches and these multi-million dollar horses getting swept up and their barn and everything and just being literally just washed out to the ocean.
[time=2946] Absolute devastation and I drove down there and saw it all in helicopters trying to lift these horses up off out of the water.
[time=2953] They land on an island and then they try to lift them out and people's entire fortunes just being wiped out by something that got out of its boundaries.
[time=2964] That's what sex does.
[time=2966] Inside of marriage sex is beautiful. Sex is wonderful. Sex is everything that God meant it to be.
[time=2973] You get it outside of its boundaries and it's devastating.
[time=2978] And of course that's true whether you're single or married.
[time=2981] It's certainly not love.
[time=2983] Look at verse 6 again that no man transgress and defraud his brother.
[time=2987] The word defraud means to take more than you're due to take unfair advantage of, to selfishly attempt to gain more at all costs using any means disregarding another person's rights.
[time=2999] When you defraud somebody you have no concern for them you just take what you want.
[time=3005] And so I just say that loud and clear as a stop sign to all of us and particularly to you who are single keep yourself morally pure.
[time=3018] Number four.
[time=3022] The integrity to reevaluate your list.
[time=3026] Now if you work with singles you know that maybe even as you think about your own single list when before you were married you know you kind of had a list of who you were looking for.
[time=3034] How tall they were supposed to be, what hair color they were supposed to have, personality, educational attributes, physical attributes, academic etc.
[time=3041] And I'm not saying having a list is wrong it's probably unavoidable.
[time=3045] Probably comes out of your past and things you're looking for in the future.
[time=3048] I certainly wouldn't want to say that it's wrong to have a list but let me challenge your list for a minute.
[time=3053] Come with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and I'll say this even though it may not be very popular kind of a different way of looking at it.
[time=3063] 1 Corinthians chapter 7 we're back to the Singleness passage verses 36 and following.
[time=3069] Interesting phenomenon going on here.
[time=3075] Says this.
[time=3076] If any man thinks that he is acting unbecomingly toward his virgin daughter so obviously a father is in view.
[time=3083] If she should be of full age and if it must be so let him do what he wishes.
[time=3088] He does not sin let her marry.
[time=3091] Verse 37.
[time=3092] But he who stands firm in his heart being under no constraint but has authority over his own will and has decided this in his own heart to keep his virgin daughter he will do well.
[time=3102] Verse 38.
[time=3103] So then both he who gives his own virgin daughter in marriage does well and he who does not give her in marriage will do better.
[time=3109] What's going on?
[time=3110] This is the ancient practice of arranged marriages and it was happening in Rome and it was happening in Greece and it was happening in Corinth and it was happening in Christian families in Corinth.
[time=3120] In other words the mom and the dad primarily the dad are sitting down figuring out who so and so is going to marry.
[time=3126] And what I find absolutely intriguing about this passage is that Paul never says they shouldn't do that.
[time=3132] He never says there should never be arranged marriages.
[time=3135] He never says that would be an atrocity the daughter or the son it's their right to choose who they want to marry.
[time=3144] What am I trying to say?
[time=3147] You realize that if we were to take all the single people associated with Black Hawk Baptist Church and put all the girls on this list and all the men on this list and just put the computer on random mode and they were all randomly assigned.
[time=3164] We could have a huge shotgun wedding here on Saturday and no problems anymore.
[time=3170] That's true. Think about that not one biblical principle about dating because there are very few if any or about marriage itself would be violated if we did that.
[time=3185] What am I trying to say?
[time=3187] The Bible when it talks about marriage talks about what the husband is going to give away to his wife.
[time=3194] It never talks about what he's looking to get and therefore formulate a list so that after marriage she'll perform on these lines.
[time=3201] When the Bible talks about the wife's responsibility it only talks about what she's supposed to give to her husband.
[time=3207] In other words you could randomly assign all of us in marriage and every biblical injunction that God has ever given we would be able to fulfill.
[time=3216] So I'm not saying throw your list away I'm saying add some things to your list.
[time=3220] Typically when I talk with singles the list is all about what I want and what is going to make me happy and how we're going to be compatible and things I'm going to need.
[time=3228] And all I'm saying is add some stuff to your list that reflects the biblical mandate of marriage.
[time=3233] Start adding some things in there if I'm right somebody with this weakness and this weakness and this weakness I could really compliment that.
[time=3239] I could really help that I could really shore that up I could bear under that hardship.
[time=3249] So I know that sounds a little weird but I really believe that when you're looking for a mate you need to look more for just how they're going to meet your pre-designed list.
[time=3260] When you see somebody with weaknesses and their error starts to become obvious and as you start to get closer and this is where a lot of those relationships fall apart and you're saying man I don't want to handle that attitude or I don't want to handle that personality quirk or I don't want to be married to that.
[time=3274] That may be God's confirmation you were built to meet that need go get it pursue it marry it and love it and compliment it all your life.
[time=3287] Number five and lastly the integrity to bloom where you are planted to bloom where you are planted.
[time=3296] One single said it this way it seems like the things I'm involved in are just things to fill time until I meet the man who will cause all the regular everyday stuff to have real meaning and significance.
[time=3309] When you and this is true of all of us when we fall into the trap the thinking that somebody or something is really going to be the dawn of awakening and then life is really going to take on meaning and significance.
[time=3322] Man guess again the greatest lesson we could ever learn from our Lord is to learn the value of this very moment in life this experience and the tendency we have is to think of life in the future when I finish college when I'm married when I get the promotion after I come back from my trip.
[time=3342] All of us tend to do that but all we have is today and this experience this sunset this two day vacation this opportunity this job this person learned to squeeze every ounce of life out of every minute of every life.
[time=3358] Live today bloom where you're planted do what God has called you to do right here and right now with all your heart doesn't mean you don't long for tomorrow it doesn't mean you don't grown under the weight of what you wish it would be but still have the courage to live it with all your strength all your might.
[time=3380] Well as our service draws to a conclusion in the main sanctuary I wanted to take a minute to ask you about the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3388] Have you ever asked Christ to be your personal Lord and Savior have you ever bowed your head and prayed to God the Father and confess your sin and acknowledged your need for the salvation that comes only through Jesus Christ.
[time=3401] You know you could do that right now in fact I'd like to lead you to prayer if that is stirring in your heart if there's something inside of you that says it's time for me to do that why don't you bow your head and pray with me.
[time=3412] Father I know that I am a sinner I know that I have violated the law of God that I am not a perfect person by any means and that the consequences of my sin is death.
[time=3423] And it will lead to be my death of the death of Christ and I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God that he died on the cross for my sins that he was buried and rose again to the third day and I accept that Christ into my heart for the forgiveness of sins
[time=3437] to be washed and to be cleansed to be forgiven of all my unrighteousness.
[time=3442] I ask Jesus to come into my heart right now and I thank you Father for the forgiveness I can have in him.
[time=3450] In Jesus name amen.
[time=3453] If in fact you prayed that prayer we'd love for you to write to us so that we can send you some information that will help you get started in your Christian walk.
