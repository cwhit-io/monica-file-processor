[time=0] So, the Apostle Paul is establishing the qualifications of the elder, who will give the leadership
[time=7] to the church.
[time=8] And he's saying that it's a good thing if men, such as these elders, are to aspire to the office of overseer.
[time=15] It's a fine work they desire to do.
[time=18] These are words that describe men of great passion, men who have thought clearly and feel deeply about the office of elder and the leadership they can give to the church, and choose to do that, giving their time and their money and sacrificing their lives, in some cases, to give leadership to the church.
[time=49] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=56] Thank you for joining us.
[time=58] Today we welcome back Pastor Moore, following his one-week absence, to speak at a mission's conference in Phoenix.
[time=64] Continuing in our study of First Timothy, he will be beginning a new series on the subject of church leadership.
[time=72] What does the Bible say about the characteristics of church leaders?
[time=76] What should be the aspirations of the church leaders?
[time=78] In today's message, Pastor Russ will address these questions.
[time=82] Through this message and the ones that will follow, it is our prayer that you will become more informed and more interested in what God's Word has to say about church leadership.
[time=92] Today's message is from First Timothy, chapter 3, verses 1 through 7.
[time=97] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to this passage.
[time=102] Our special music today will include a medley on the organ by Scott Schindler, featuring lead-on, O King Eternal, and portions from the Hallelujah Chorus.
[time=110] In addition, Mark E. Isaacson will be singing a medley of Ferris Lord Jesus, and I'd rather
[time=116] have Jesus.
[time=119] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's begin our time of worship as our sanctuary choir and orchestra present, the majesty and glory of your name.
[time=141] When I gaze into the light's eyes and see the world of your feet in theirs, the moon
[time=161] and stars, and dead in space, oh, what is there?
[time=174] God is man that you are mindful of in.
[time=181] You have given well a round of glory and honor, and have made him a little more than the angels.
[time=195] You have put him in charge of our creation, the beast of the field.
[time=205] We are servants of the earth, not the angel of the sea, and your age, but what is and
[time=217] oh, what is man that you are mindful of in.
[time=229] Oh Lord, our Lord, our majesty and glory of your name.
[time=244] Oh Lord, our Lord, our little children pray to where they will be, and so would we, and
[time=267] so would we, O Lord, our new young, our new young, our majesty and glory of your name.
[time=296] Oh Lord, our new young, our majesty and glory of your name.
[time=317] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=340] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=353] Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=584] Hello and thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=594] I want to say that I was really encouraged as we met as a staff this week to see the number of prayer requests that were sent in by all of you watching and we took some time to look at that request list and pray for many of you that have physical ailments
[time=610] that you needed prayer for and we're glad that you wrote it and please continue to write us and tell us of your problems and even of the encouragements that you've received from the Lord in recent weeks.
[time=620] Arasah we've been in this new worship center for about this is going on our third year now and we've just enjoyed the physical facilities that we have here.
[time=629] God has really blessed us and we're already into another phase of building and for a
[time=635] number of months we've been overcrowded in our Christian school and we're looking forward to future growth of the Christian school and we need physical facilities.
[time=643] So I want to take a moment now and just kind of show you the exterior view of the extension of our worship center that we'll be adding in just a few beginning in just a few weeks
[time=654] really.
[time=655] This is a view looking if you were coming from the east heading west and you would see the
[time=661] entrance here to the educational facility that will be added on to our worship center.
[time=666] Our worship center is on the far right side of your picture come out of the worship center and head east into classrooms a large foyer and then a gymnasium for our Christian school.
[time=678] Arasah you've been really involved in this program what does this facility entail how many square feet and well it's 10 classrooms a large foyer and then a gymnasium that we think will sit about seat about 1200 people and as you said we've had need for this because
[time=694] our Christian school continues to grow and the quality of the program continues to build as well as our Sunday morning we call them ABF's adult Bible fellowships that's our adult
[time=705] Sunday school classes they continue to have need they're bursting at the seams and so the building really comes along at just the right time for our church.
[time=713] The two particular areas that you talked about are very important to our church our ABF's which
[time=719] are the adult Bible fellowships that breaks our larger church down into a real a family like atmosphere and now both of us were at a party Friday night and it was really neat to see the group dynamics that take place in the ABF's and then we're excited about the school and I want to tell you to stay tuned in the next couple weeks because we're going to have the school administrator Mr. Steve Longbreak on next week to tell you how you can register become more informed about the Christian school if you have children or grandchildren
[time=747] that might be interested in a private school education we'll give you some more information next week so stay tuned with us.
[time=754] Well Russell you were gone last week and we enjoyed the ministry of our associate pastor Jim Pearson but I know you had a good time in the Bible conference in Arizona I'd like to hear a little bit about it.
[time=763] Well we went out to speak at Northwest Community Church in Glendale Arizona actually and they were in the middle of a missions conference and we were one of the keynote speakers and was able to bring a message or two on the topic of missions.
[time=777] We also enjoyed some time together hiding I we went on a few days early and just enjoyed some of the Arizona Sun and we were thrilled to know that having been there only a few days we had a strong sense of wanting to get home and seeing Fort Wayne as our home and I think the Lord has really moved in our hearts and in a good way a solidifying way
[time=796] we came home and bought a house actually the way it worked about a house last week so we're here for good now you're kind of stuck with us.
[time=802] Yeah amen that you always wonder when you're away from home whether you feel when that feeling
[time=809] is going to come that this is home and that's a great announcement and we're glad for you too that you have a new home and hope that you can move in it very soon and get situated.
[time=819] Perhaps a lot of you have had the situations where somebody has called you on the telephone or stopped by your home and said help I need some help in my life and you say jeepers I don't know really how to work with this relationship here I'm struggling well we need to be able
[time=835] to know how to help a friend and also how to be a friend and we are offering this month
[time=841] a book entitled relationships it's a small pamphlet but it'll give you a great deal of insight on working with people working with relationships with your own family as well as friends that might come your way so we'd like to have you write for it today you can receive it absolutely free if you'll write to the Bible hour at 7400 East State Fort
[time=860] Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815 once again right to the Bible hour 7400 East State
[time=869] Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815 you just need to simply ask for the booklet
[time=875] entitled relationships we're going to go back to the live portion of our program now I hope you'll stay tuned for some more music and then the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore on her face in her hands and is looking for a little bit more on her face and her
[time=892] hands and is looking for a little bit more on her face and her hands and is looking for a little bit more on her face and her hands and is looking for a little bit more on her face and her hands and is looking for a little bit more on her face and her hands and is

[time=943] [MUSIC - 200 seconds]
[time=1146] (audience applauds)
[time=1163] - Thank you, Margie.
[time=1167] Beautiful song.
[time=1168] Certainly expresses the sentiment of our heart, I'm sure yours as well.
[time=1173] I'd rather have Jesus than anything.
[time=1175] Silver or gold, riches untold.
[time=1178] Well, we have a joy of returning to the study of God's word this morning and I must confess while I like being away, I like being back a lot more because I get to be back in the study panic preach mode, which kind of like you study all week then you panic through the weekend and then you preach on Sunday morning and it's very invigorating to me and my heart is thrilled that we can come back to 1 Timothy chapter three.
[time=1201] And if you turn there, let me read these seven verses, we'll spend at least two or three weeks trying to get an understanding of what it is that God establishes as leadership in the church, leadership in the church.
[time=1216] It is a trustworthy statement.
[time=1218] If any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.
[time=1223] An overseer then must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperant, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach.
[time=1231] Not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, incontentious, free from the love of money.
[time=1237] He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=1243] But if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?
[time=1248] And not a new convert, lest he become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
[time=1253] And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=1261] Needless to say, this is a passage about leadership and there can be no question about the importance of leadership in the church.
[time=1270] And really, there can be no question about the importance of leadership in any organization, whether it be a business venture, a Boy Scout club, an athletic team or even the United States of America.
[time=1282] Abraham Lincoln is remembered as one of the greatest leaders to ever be president of this great nation.
[time=1288] It appears, however, that he had some difficulty, great challenge in the Civil War, finding good men to lead his army.
[time=1296] He had a lot of trouble finding a general who would fight.
[time=1300] As a matter of fact, he appointed and then discharged no less than 10 men before he appointed or landed upon the one man, Ulysses S. Grant.
[time=1311] The common threat of failure in Grant's predecessors was their reluctance to quote unquote engage the enemy.
[time=1320] General Scott wanted to blockade and lay siege and passively wait.
[time=1325] McDowell elected to build up and train forces rather than attack.
[time=1328] McClellan planned and strategized and over-analyzed himself to the point of inactivity.
[time=1334] Lincoln said he had the slows.
[time=1336] Henry Hallack didn't attack the enemy because he had a nervous breakdown, couldn't take the pressure.
[time=1341] And as Lincoln wrote, he broke down, nerve and pluck all gone and has ever since evaded all possible responsibility, little more than since a first-rate clerk.
[time=1352] Others would defend under the attack, but refuse to pursue the enemy into the south for complete victory.
[time=1360] Still others would continue to delay while calling for more troops and more supplies.
[time=1365] So current or regular a theme was this delaying and calling for additional troops and more supplies that on the very day that President Lincoln appointed Grant to be his commander in chief, he sat him down and explained it this way.
[time=1380] He said, I can best share my frustrations with you by telling you a story.
[time=1384] The story reads this.
[time=1386] At one time, there was a great war among the animals.
[time=1389] And one side had great difficulty in getting a commander who had sufficient confidence in himself.
[time=1395] Finally, they found a monkey who said that he thought he could command their army if his tail could be a little longer.
[time=1401] So they got more tail.
[time=1403] He looked at it admiringly and then thought he ought to have a little more still.
[time=1408] This was added and again he called for more.
[time=1410] The splicing process was repeated many times until they had coiled the monkey's tail around the room, filling all the space.
[time=1418] Then they wrapped it around his shoulders until its weight broke him down.
[time=1422] Grant got the message and affirmed the president that he would not call for additional supplies or resources unless it was absolutely necessary.
[time=1432] Two months after that date, he launched what is remembered as the bloody wilderness campaign.
[time=1437] He went after Lee.
[time=1438] And while the battle was still raging and the outcome still in the balance, he reported back to the president that the suffering, they were suffering enormous casualties, but he vowed to quote unquote fight it out on this line if it took all summer.
[time=1452] That was music to the president's ears and he responded by telegram saying this way, hold on with a bulldog grip and chew and choke as much as possible.
[time=1463] All he did, he kept fighting and kept pushing and till finally the north ran a string of victories that eventually led to the south downfall.
[time=1474] Nashville, Savannah, Wilmington, Columbia, Petersburg and Richmond ensured the final victory the north would have and it was consummated at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia on April 9th, 1865.
[time=1486] He'd finally found a man who could fight.
[time=1488] I share this bit of American history only to bring two things to mind.
[time=1494] First, it reminds us that things of great value are worth fighting for.
[time=1500] And all too often in the battle, there are great casualties.
[time=1504] Fighting for the freedom of the slaves, in this case, it was indeed a noble cause, but it pales in insignificance with the battle and the fight for the souls of men and not to advance a nation but the very kingdom of God itself.
[time=1518] And secondly because it reminds us that great battles require great leadership.
[time=1525] And that great leadership is marked at least in part by their willingness to engage the enemy.
[time=1532] And that is of course what Paul is asking Timothy to do.
[time=1535] Go back to 1 Timothy chapter one, verse 18 and be reminded that Paul is calling Timothy to battle and to fight.
[time=1544] Verse 18, this command, I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may fight the good fight.
[time=1553] This little church, this church's Ephesus is hanging in the balance and with it other churches that it later started.
[time=1563] And the battle is raging.
[time=1564] The battle is a fierce confrontation between leadership.
[time=1569] It is between the leadership of false prophets who are like savage wolves that have entered in among you even as Paul had anticipated they would do.
[time=1576] They are not sparing the flock.
[time=1578] They come from within and they rise from without and they are speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them.
[time=1585] This is a battle of leadership and the spiritual dimension, the human spiritual dimension for the souls of men and the apostle Paul is calling his general to take arms and fight.
[time=1597] Fight the good fight, the noble fight.
[time=1600] Timothy is reluctant, Timothy is by nature.
[time=1602] We gather from these two books, first and second Timothy, somewhat reluctant to be confrontational.
[time=1608] He has even been persuaded by the enormous leadership of these false prophets who have infiltrated the church and taken positions of leadership and he is backing down and Paul calls him to arms and he develops a rather brilliant strategy for his young general.
[time=1625] He arms Timothy first with this very epistle.
[time=1628] This would have carried the weight of the apostle Paul and suddenly this young man, probably half the age of those he was called to confront, now had in his hand a very document signed and delivered from the hands of the apostle Paul himself.
[time=1641] It gave him tremendous credibility and authority to execute the battle.
[time=1645] He begins then inside this letter as you remember in chapter one by calling for a blunt refutation of the false doctrines.
[time=1655] Do you remember it in verse three?
[time=1657] Remain on at Ephesus in order that you may instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrines there in chapter one, nor to a pay attention to and then he just declares what they're doing.
[time=1666] They're preaching myth and they're preaching endless genealogy which gives rise to nothing, mere speculation and he contrasts it to what good preaching should do which would be to provoke love and the furtherance of the administration of God which is by faith.
[time=1681] In other words, these men are teaching nothing and it adds up to nothing.
[time=1686] And the first step in confining them is to openly declare what it is, call it what it is and dismiss it.
[time=1692] Verse six, for some men straying from these things have turned aside to fruitless discussion, wanting to be teachers of the law even though they do not understand either what they are saying or the matters about which they make confident assertions.
[time=1705] So he begins the battle for his young general by just openly confronting their doctrine saying that it is nothing and it adds up to nothing but then with a stroke of genius in chapter three verses one to seven, he delivers another blow to these false prophets by listing the qualifications of a true prophet, by listing the qualifications of godly leadership and in so doing he will inevitably expose these false prophets.
[time=1736] In other words, if it isn't enough to decry their false doctrine he says here is a measure of character and if the man can make this measure of character listen to what he says because Paul knows that inevitably men's morals are corrupted by erroneous doctrine.
[time=1754] First Timothy six, verse three, if anyone advocates a different doctrine and does not agree with sound words those of our Lord Jesus Christ and with the doctrine conforming to godliness listen to the description of his character.
[time=1766] He is conceited, he understands nothing.
[time=1768] He has more of an interest in controversial questions and disputes about words out of which arise envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions and constant friction between men of depraved mind and deprived of the truth who suppose that godliness is a means of gain.
[time=1784] That's the ministry, that's the mark of their ministry.
[time=1787] That's the mark of who they are as men.
[time=1789] They're involved in envy and strife and abusive language and evil suspicions and there's constant friction in their own life and in the lives of their followers who emulate their teaching and their lifestyle.
[time=1801] So he hands to Timothy an incredible weapon in this fight for truth and the fight for the survival of the church at Ephesus by giving him a template if you will of character against which the horrid character of these false prophets must be compared.
[time=1815] You notice at the end of verse five there?
[time=1818] Who suppose that godliness is a means of gain?
[time=1820] What kind of gain?
[time=1821] Well the context answers it without doubt, verse 10, for the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil and by longing for it some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many a pain.
[time=1831] These men are charlatans, these men are assuming positions of leadership and spewing false doctrine and gathering unto themselves disciples in order that they can become rich and in our day and age it's the same song different verse, different names but it is a powerful weapon in the hands of this young disciple.
[time=1851] Again in second Timothy chapter three he notes again that men who preach false doctrine will not have a character of life that can stand the test of the word of God.
[time=1861] Verse two says, "For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient the parents, ungrateful and holy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips without self control, brooder haters of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
[time=1880] Holding to a form of godliness it looks like it's the truth although they have denied its power and avoid such men as these.
[time=1891] So mark it well, a man may come to you and he may give you a form of godliness.
[time=1896] He may teach as though he knows the truth and in addition to declaring that what he is saying is wrong as Paul has done in chapter one he says, the further and clenching test of whether or not they are of God and whether or not they are men of God and whether or not they should be followed is does the character of their life match up with this standard of godly leadership in the church as presented in 1 Timothy chapter three verses one through seven.
[time=1923] So that I hope by way of review, that I hope by way of reminding you of the battle and the urgency of the moment that God have godly men in leadership.
[time=1935] This morning we will just begin to understand that by looking at verse one, let's read it again.
[time=1942] First Timothy chapter three now, verse one, it is a trustworthy statement.
[time=1948] If any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do and this morning let's just look at the identity of church leadership and then secondly the aspiration of church leadership.
[time=1960] First, the identity of church leadership.
[time=1963] Who are these men?
[time=1964] Not the false prophets.
[time=1965] Who are the godly men who are to give leadership to the church?
[time=1968] Well they are called three terms in the New Testament but these three terms basically describe the same group of men in church leadership.
[time=1977] In this passage, they are called overseers.
[time=1980] In other passages, they are called elders and in other passages, they are called pastors or shepherds.
[time=1987] It could be translated either way.
[time=1989] If you turn with me to Acts chapter 20, I'll show you and I believe this is important for us even as a church to understand a little bit about church government and the way the New Testament lays that out for us.
[time=2002] Many of you come from churches where the bishop has had some extraordinary power conferred upon him by a confederation of churches whereby he directs elders and pastors and directs a number of different churches all at the same time and that is really foreign to any New Testament thought.
[time=2019] What we have here in chapter 20, verses 17 to, well about 38, is Paul's meeting with the elders of Ephesus on the island of Miletus.
[time=2030] And this is an important passage for us because in this passage, he calls them elders in verse 17.
[time=2037] He calls them overseers in verse 28 and he calls them shepherds in verse 28, meaning that they are synonymous, that this one group of men who have gathered together with him on the island of Miletus, the elders of the church at Ephesus are called these three terms interchangeably, elder, overseer and shepherd.
[time=2060] Now why?
[time=2061] Why do we use three different terms to describe the same group of men?
[time=2065] And I don't wanna make a huge deal out of this but I believe there is a nuance to each word that is worthy of our attention.
[time=2071] The word elder, Prezbutaras in the Greek, is tied to the church's Jewish tradition.
[time=2077] It's traced back to the occasion when Moses in the desert found himself unable to administrate these two million plus as they wandered through the wilderness.
[time=2085] And so in Numbers 11, 16 says he appointed 70 elders, 70 men to offer wisdom and to help litigate in cases of dispute.
[time=2094] The concept continued to grow and as the synagogues began to spring up elders were those who were the real leaders of the Jewish community.
[time=2103] They presided over the worship of the synagogue, they administered rebuke and discipline when that was necessary and they settled the disputes and arguments of the cases which in other nations would have gone to a formal court to have a judge preside.
[time=2115] In the Jewish community the elders decided.
[time=2118] Amongst the Jews the elders were the respected men who exercised a fatherly, elderly, seasoned in wisdom oversight over the spiritual and material affairs of every Jewish community.
[time=2132] It's interesting to note however that eldership is not confined to the Jewish community or to the Christian community.
[time=2139] The presiding body of the Spartans was called the Gerosia which means the board of elder men.
[time=2145] The parliament of Rome was called the senate which comes from cynics which means an older man.
[time=2151] In England the men who looked after the affairs of the community were called the aldermen which means elder men.
[time=2157] So there is nothing new or unique or profound necessarily about giving the leadership of an organization to older and more mature and wise men.
[time=2165] But the point that we note here is that age alone does not qualify for leadership in the church.
[time=2172] It may qualify other places but age alone does not qualify a man for leadership in the church.
[time=2177] Nor does experience.
[time=2178] Nor does a vast life of various experiences qualify a man.
[time=2183] When we return back to 1 Timothy and study the qualifications it will be obvious.
[time=2187] That it's not just age and it's not just wisdom preeminently it is godliness and a spiritual appetite for the things of god which first qualifies a man for leadership and the fact that he is older and wiser in some practical ways and spiritual ways is helpful.
[time=2202] The word overseer then describes more of the function of overseeing.
[time=2208] It's often used as it is in the Old Testament.
[time=2212] The Septuagint that is the Greek version of the Hebrew Old Testament.
[time=2216] The word there for overseer is used.
[time=2218] Episcopos to describe the task masters who were over the public works and the public assembly or the public buildings.
[time=2226] Second Chronicles 34, 17.
[time=2228] The Greeks used this same word to describe what we would call commissioners who were appointed to regulate the affairs of the city and so did the Romans.
[time=2236] They used the word to describe magistrates who were appointed to regulate the affairs of the city.
[time=2241] So the overseer then describes that part of the job which is administrative and overseeing in that nature.
[time=2251] The last word here, shepherd, Pomea, which can also be translated pastor, really refers to the elders' responsibility to feed his flock, to teach truth, to give doctrine and to communicate the truth of God.
[time=2264] If you come with me again now back to 1 Timothy, you only go past chapter three, come all the way to chapter five.
[time=2270] 1 Timothy chapter five.
[time=2272] And you'll find these same three concepts communicated in verse 17.
[time=2278] Let the elders who rule, well elders, let the older wise godly men who rule, that's their oversight capacity.
[time=2287] Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who, and here comes the pastor's responsibility, work hard at preaching and teaching, feeding the flock.
[time=2299] So this is a group of men all holding the same office of leadership in the church called by three different names, each name giving a different flavor to their ministry.
[time=2309] Now it's important to add at this point that it doesn't mean that some are paid for their ministry and others do it on a voluntary free will basis.
[time=2320] You can see both in the New Testament, you can see both in the life of Paul.
[time=2323] At some point in his ministry, he functions as an apostle and in many ways as a pastor, teacher, overseer, elder.
[time=2330] Sometimes he does that as a tent maker and doesn't require any money from the family.
[time=2334] He just comes and assumes no ministry resource from them, he pays for all of his living expenses.
[time=2340] In other places, people will recognize that he is of significant value and at the point in that church and that time it's best for them to assume the expenses of his day to day affairs to pay that for him so that he can be freed up on a continual basis to do the work of the church.
[time=2356] We have both of those in this church.
[time=2359] We have some who are elders, otherwise known as overseers, otherwise known as could be called pastors.
[time=2364] Our elder board could be called pastors as the word of God calls them such.
[time=2368] They are not being paid by the church.
[time=2371] They give their services a voluntary way in that sense are like Paul as a tent maker.
[time=2376] Others of our leaders, we call them staff here, men who are qualified as elders.
[time=2382] We don't refer to them as such, we call them staff.
[time=2384] These men, including myself, are paid by the church and therefore freed up on a regular basis from the concerns of earning a living so that they can administer their gifts in the church in a similar fashion, but in a more involved way.
[time=2397] So it's just important that we understand.
[time=2401] Elder, overseer, pastor, three names, same men.
[time=2406] Some men are paid full time for that ministry, others function in a tent making fashion.
[time=2411] It's also important to understand that the pastor teacher, the person who is in my position, is really nothing more than a spokesman for the rest of the elder board and staff.
[time=2421] This is our doctrine, this is our church.
[time=2424] And when we delineate truth from the word of God, it is not necessarily my view, although sometimes I'll clue you to that, I'll put a flag up and say, "This is my thought on this." But when we are basically moving through the truth of the word of God, it is not to be isolated from the rest of the elder board, the rest of the staff and the concerted, concerted thought and opinion and commitment to establish truth, even as we have all articulated that basically in our confession of faith.
[time=2452] And in that way, you have ascribed to that as well, and you have approved that and voted in on that.
[time=2456] So there is within the plurality of leadership, elders and staff, Godly men who have been raised up to lead the church, there are some who are gifted in certain ways that allow them to perform a certain function, and in my case be a spokesman for the rest to articulate doctrine and to advance the kingdom of God in this public way, but really only as their representative, really as a member of them, but as their spokesman.
[time=2483] So that is the identification.
[time=2486] What is the aspiration of church leadership?
[time=2489] And we find that also in verse one, chapter three.
[time=2492] It is a trustworthy statement.
[time=2495] If any man, and here's the first word of aspiration, aspires to the office of overseer, this word aspire is a powerful word describing a man's longings and desires.
[time=2507] It means to stretch oneself out.
[time=2510] It's written in the middle voice, which means I reach out to grab this thing and bring it back to myself.
[time=2516] This is describing a very strong desire in the heart of a man to be a part of the work of the office of an overseer.
[time=2524] He's reaching out for it, he's stretching towards it.
[time=2527] He's exerting himself to be able to have that responsibility and then pull it back into himself so he can discharge his duties as an overseer.
[time=2536] The second word is even stronger.
[time=2538] If any man aspires to the office of an overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.
[time=2544] The word desire is epithemia.
[time=2546] And if you know anything about Greek, that's the word for lust.
[time=2550] That's the same word in other places in the Bible where a man is decried for his uncontrollable passion and lust for a woman.
[time=2559] Here, of course, it's not a negative word because he's lusting or he's longing or he's seeking or he is intensely desiring something that is holy as opposed to something that is illicit and sinful.
[time=2570] It's amazing, isn't it?
[time=2572] Paul is implicitly affirming men who would reach out and stretch to grab and then execute the office of overseeing and that's driven in them by a compulsion best described by epithemia.
[time=2588] This incredibly insatiable desire to minister in the church.
[time=2593] Well, as soon as you get done explaining that, there are always concerns in people's minds and rightly so.
[time=2598] Are you saying, is the Bible saying that we are to put ambitious men into leadership, men who would reach for things, men who would be driven by strong desire to have things for themselves?
[time=2609] I mean, what did Jeremiah say?
[time=2611] "Are you seeking great things for yourself?
[time=2614] Do not seek them." Shakespeare made Woolsey say, "Cromwell, I charge the fling away ambitions." By that sin fell the angels.
[time=2624] How can man, then, the image of his maker hope to profit by it?
[time=2629] Well, there is wisdom in those words.
[time=2632] There is an illegitimate desire.
[time=2634] There is an illegitimate ambition even for ministry that the Bible condemns.
[time=2639] You saw them again in chapter one verse seven.
[time=2642] These false prophets are wanting to be teachers of the law.
[time=2647] If you were to turn to Philippians chapter one, you'd find another group of men who are aspiring to leadership out of sinful motive and desire.
[time=2654] Paul has been taken into prison and he has left the vacuum of leadership for the New Testament churches.
[time=2658] And there are men who are rushing to take and assume that leadership and to have that privilege.
[time=2664] And he says they're men of pretense.
[time=2666] They are men who are not in reality what they present themselves to be.
[time=2669] They're driven by selfish motives and selfish ambitions.
[time=2674] Well, Jesus really gives the death blow to that kind of ambition.
[time=2678] You don't have to come.
[time=2679] I'm going to read over in Mark chapter 10.
[time=2681] You remember the account.
[time=2682] It's John and James.
[time=2685] And they're thinking about the future.
[time=2687] James and John, the sons of Zebedee, they're wondering about the millennial kingdom and they're trying to secure for themselves a position of great leadership.
[time=2695] And so they think they're cunning.
[time=2697] Of course, Jesus knows what's in the hearts of men.
[time=2700] And they say, teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you.
[time=2706] It's kind of like a genie at this point.
[time=2707] And he said to them, well, what do you want me to do?
[time=2711] And they said to him, grant that we may sit in your glory.
[time=2716] One on your right and one on your left.
[time=2719] Ill, illegitimate desire for a position and prestige for fame for glory.
[time=2727] Jesus said to them, you do not know what you are asking for.
[time=2733] Are you able to drink the cup that I drink or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?
[time=2739] And they said to him, we are able.
[time=2742] And Jesus said to them, well, the cup that I drink, you shall drink.
[time=2747] And you shall be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized, meaning their death as they served Christ in later years.
[time=2754] He says, calling the other 10 together who had overheard this vying for power and prestige and teaches them a lesson as was his custom.
[time=2764] And calling them to himself, Jesus said to them, you know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles, lorded over them.
[time=2771] And their great men exercise authority over them, but it is not so among you.
[time=2777] Whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your, what?
[time=2781] Servant shall be your servant.
[time=2784] And whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.
[time=2788] And then with an allusion to his own death, for even the son of man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many.
[time=2800] Jesus says that what should be in the heart of a man aspiring to leadership, longing to leadership, seeking to reach out and grab and take unto himself to leadership is the desire to serve and to give his life away.
[time=2814] So committed is he to God.
[time=2815] So enamored is he with the wonder of the New Testament church.
[time=2818] So impacted by the souls of men that he literally has a strong compulsion to give his life away even to the point of death to do this work of the overseer.
[time=2831] It's interesting, the Bible rarely uses the word leader in a positive sense.
[time=2835] Whenever it's being used, it's typically to describe and to decry the selfish motives of worldly leadership.
[time=2841] Instead, when the Bible wants to talk about leadership, it says it this way, is not Moses, excuse me, it's not Moses my leader, it's Moses my servant.
[time=2850] Over and over again, the Lord emphasizes service
[time=2856] as the heart of leadership.
[time=2859] So there are ambitions that are noble and there are ambitions that are worthy.
[time=2863] And this is certainly one of them.
[time=2865] You remember that this is the New Testament early first generation church.
[time=2869] There was no prestige in being an elder, they didn't know what they were.
[time=2873] There was full of danger and responsibility and hardship and contempt and rejection that would have known nothing of the grandeur as far as respect that comes with that position in this kind of a church.
[time=2885] I believe it's encouraged for another reason, not just because of the service involved, but because Paul is affirming in men's heart, even young men that when you can so understand the mission of the church, when you understand what God has been doing through history, when you are so impacted by the reality that this is the organism of Christ, this is the living body of Jesus Christ.
[time=2911] This is the most important organization or organism that has ever been on the face of the earth.
[time=2916] Far more important than any nation ever was or could be.
[time=2919] This is the true and living church and when men come to see it in that light, he commends that because when they see it in that light, they long to give themselves to it and serve therein.
[time=2929] Far too many men see the church as little more than a social outlet, some type of family obligation we do for the kids' sake, but that's where it stops.
[time=2940] They have no real passion for the church because they have no real vision for the kingdom of God and for what God has been doing through the centuries.
[time=2947] They can't begin to see what is so compelling about the church.
[time=2950] Responsibilities in the church, that would just interrupt my flow of my pursuit in my job or extracurricular activities in and of themselves, not wrong, but these men have thrown themselves at their job and completely given themselves to their hobbies and to their extracurricular activities and to think of sacrificing my advancement in my job or my fun and my activity for the church.
[time=2975] Why?
[time=2976] You see, that's a mentality that fills many men's hearts and it betrays an impoverished understanding of what God is doing, who He is and what He's all about.
[time=2987] Men who are overwhelmed with the desire to shepherd souls,
[time=2993] to care for the welfare of families, to train men into the next generation of leaders, to equip people to evangelize, to strategize missions involvement, not just in this city but around the world, to work hard every Sunday morning in little classrooms with little people called children to ensure that this church has a strong, dynamic children's ministry.
[time=3018] Men do those kinds of things because they understand the importance of the kingdom of God.
[time=3023] Others will give themselves to organize and to administrate and to details and to numbers and to facilities because that's their strength and they know how it adds up.
[time=3033] These are men who view this not as an obligation, not as some peripheral collateral involvement.
[time=3039] This is why they were born.
[time=3041] This is the most important thing they could ever do.
[time=3044] This is it.
[time=3045] This is the church of Jesus Christ that is moving the kingdom of God forward that thrills their soul.
[time=3052] Paul commends that.
[time=3054] When men hold that in their heart, such that they are ready to reach for it, such that they, if you will, lust for it.
[time=3063] Paul says, "No, that's good." That shows the man understands the brevity of life and the eternality of God and the future of the kingdom.
[time=3073] And he wants to say to young and old alike, "Set your heart on such a vocation," whether it be as a layperson or whether it be in full-time ministry.
[time=3082] Our church is full of men like that.
[time=3086] Blackhawk is blessed beyond its wildest dreams with men who pursue such ministry, not out of default, not because there's nothing else they could do, not because they don't have other interests, but they sacrifice those and count it, but little sacrifice in light of the joy of serving the church, serving the body of Christ.
[time=3108] These are men of passion who have thought clearly about life who feel deeply about their God and who are willing to pay a price, to see the cause of Christ go forward.
[time=3124] Well, the identity, these are men who are overseers, men who are bishops, men who are elders,
[time=3135] men who are pastors who love the church of God.
[time=3140] They love it so much, they aspire in their aspirations.
[time=3145] They long, they desire to be involved in it.
[time=3152] Just in conclusion this morning, it's interesting to note that Abraham Lincoln spent years searching for a one man, one man by the name of Grant.
[time=3162] What a difference that one man made.
[time=3165] The outcome of the war, what became the destiny of the United States of America profoundly impacted by this one man who was willing to fight, who was willing to risk, who was willing to do what his commander-in-chief called him to do.
[time=3183] But I find it fascinating that through the centuries, through the millennia of time, God too has been searching.
[time=3193] Sometimes only for one man, because that's all he could find.
[time=3198] One man who would serve, one man who would lead, just one man who would give his life for the cause of Christ.
[time=3210] Oftentimes, God is depicted in the scriptures as searching for a certain type of man.
[time=3215] God is selective.
[time=3217] God is not looking for men.
[time=3219] He is looking for a man.
[time=3220] God is not looking for a group but an individual.
[time=3225] Ezekiel 22, I searched for a man who should stand in the gap before me for this land.
[time=3238] Is there a man who would stand in the gap between God and the people for the benefit of both?
[time=3244] To Jeremiah, he said, "Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see if you can find a man that executes judgment and seeks the truth, and I will pardon." Just a man, looking for a man.
[time=3263] I looked, Jeremiah, 425, and behold, there was no man, the crisis of leadership.
[time=3270] For Samuel 13, the Lord has sought out for himself a man after his own heart.
[time=3277] I wanna say to you men this morning who are elders,
[time=3285] and maybe you've never held the position of elder in this church, but you're an elder by virtue of your character and your ministry in this church, and it's just never been recognized by a title.
[time=3293] I wanna say to both you who have had no title and you who presently have a title.
[time=3297] The overriding need of this church
[time=3304] is for you not only to continue to lead, but to discharge your leadership to a next generation.
[time=3312] And I trust that you men have a younger man in your life,
[time=3318] that you have welcomed to your family, that you have welcomed to your business at whatever level he can view and participate and see you in the throes of real life, that you are giving to him the same passion that somehow God in his grace has given to you.
[time=3335] Another word I wanna give to the moms today,
[time=3341] you women who have been blessed beyond your wildest dreams, you've been given a son.
[time=3346] In your home every day, there is a boy and you hold the power like no one else to touch his life,
[time=3360] to build his vision, to set his heart aflame for the tender side of ministry, to kindle within him a desire to care for the souls of people, even as you care for him and his soul.
[time=3375] As you talk with him about his future, from the time he's just old enough to understand, as you reinforce character in the day-to-day in a way that his dad can't do because he's not there as often.
[time=3387] As he comes to you with tears in his eyes, be the one that creates and forms the character there
[time=3397] by God's grace, even as Lois and Eunice did in the life of Timothy.
[time=3409] (gentle music) I hope the music enriched your life this morning as the sanctuary choir sang and as Scott Schindler played and the soloist Margie Isaacson ministered to you.
[time=3421] Our message today was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3425] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior.
[time=3429] Just before we close, let's bow and pray this prayer together.
[time=3432] Our Father, I thank you for sending your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3439] And I know through his death that I can be cleansed from my sin, I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and make my heart clean today.
[time=3450] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3453] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3458] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
