[time=0] So, we continue in our study of the overseer or the elder, the men who would give spiritual
[time=7] leadership to the church, and we find that they are to be above reproach.
[time=10] There is to be nothing in their life which overtly discredits them from the ministry, nothing that can be laid hold of in their life, in the character of their life.
[time=20] We find this morning that they are to be able to teach, and this is really the only function listed in the entire list of qualifications, that they are to be able to teach, for their ability to teach is predicated on godly character.
[time=34] Men who do not live what they preach, unsay everything they've said, and therefore should
[time=40] not be in leadership.
[time=54] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=60] Thank you for joining us.
[time=63] Today Pastor Moore will be presenting the third in a series of messages on church leadership from 1 Timothy chapter 3.
[time=71] When the world looks for a leader, it often looks for how successful an individual has been.
[time=75] What has he accomplished?
[time=77] The Bible says that we should select church leaders on the basis of their character and their relationships.
[time=82] How does a man relate to his wife, to his family, and to those outside the church?
[time=87] It's a sobering thought to realize that we are only as spiritual as our worst relationship.
[time=94] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Timothy chapter 3, so that you can be prepared to study along with us.
[time=102] Our special music today will include a song from Susan Toyrach's Dump entitled "Immortal Invisible." And just before the message, Lisa Renacher will sing a song entitled "He Is Able."
[time=116] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's begin our time of worship as our sanctuary choir in orchestra with soloist Kevin Rowe present "Something Great." [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC] [MUSIC]
[time=902] [MUSIC - 227 seconds]
[time=1135] Thank you, Lisa.
[time=1138] Putting feelings and music and expression to the truth of God.
[time=1143] Abraham said that he knew that God was able.
[time=1146] And instead of growing weak in faith, excuse me, weak in disbelief, he grew strong in faith, giving glory to God.
[time=1153] What a beautiful song.
[time=1155] Well, let me ask you to take your Bibles this morning as we go back to our study in 1st Timothy chapter 3.
[time=1161] And if you're with us for the first time today or you've been away for a few weeks, we are studying the book of 1st Timothy.
[time=1168] We are moving through it chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph, verse by verse in an expositional manner, meaning we are taking close examination of the text and seeking the truth of God and principles therein that will guide our lives.
[time=1183] And we are in a passage of Scripture verses 1 through 7.
[time=1187] That's all about elders, all about overseers, all about shepherds or pastors as they give oversight and leadership to the New Testament church.
[time=1197] Would you follow along as I read it?
[time=1199] It is a trustworthy statement.
[time=1202] If any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.
[time=1208] An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperant, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach.
[time=1217] Not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, uncontentious, free from the love of money.
[time=1223] He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=1230] But if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?
[time=1236] And not a new convert, lest he become conceited and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
[time=1243] And he must have a good reputation with those outside the church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=1253] We've been looking at these church leaders, and we have found, in verse 1, two aspects of them, their identity and their aspiration.
[time=1261] Their identity is that they are called overseers.
[time=1264] Other places in scripture, the same group of men or men who would perform a similar function in the church are called elders.
[time=1270] Other places pastor and that is used interchangeably.
[time=1274] Those are three terms that are used to describe the same office of leadership.
[time=1279] In the church, some are paid by the church for their ministry.
[time=1283] Others find their way of living or the support for their living outside the church and volunteer their oversight.
[time=1290] But they are all the same group of men.
[time=1292] They are all the same leadership in the church, and they are those that God has given to oversee the New Testament church.
[time=1299] We also identified them with their aspiration.
[time=1302] They are men of strong passion and two words in this first verse described that passion. The first is found at the beginning of the verse.
[time=1310] It is a trustworthy statement if any man aspires to the office of overseer reaches out and takes for himself the office of overseer.
[time=1318] And then at the end of the verse, a work he desires to do.
[time=1322] This is a strong word, epiphemia, he desires it deep within his soul.
[time=1328] So these are men who are giving oversight to the church and who do that out of a deep, compelling passion in their heart and life to serve God.
[time=1337] But desire alone does not qualify them as leaders.
[time=1342] The fact that they have a strong and ordinate desire to pursue the work of leading the church does not necessarily qualify them for that.
[time=1350] And so Paul gives a list of qualifications.
[time=1353] A standard is lifted up and it is in the following verses.
[time=1357] He begins in verse two saying that an overseer then must be above reproach. Above reproach is a general term.
[time=1366] It is an overarching term that really encapsulates all the other qualifications that follow.
[time=1372] And all the areas that follow he must be above reproach.
[time=1375] To be above reproach literally means to take a hold of.
[time=1378] There is nothing in your life that somebody can take a hold of.
[time=1382] It is tangible. It is there. It is substantial.
[time=1385] In these categories that would disqualify you from leadership.
[time=1389] The standard is character. The standard is godliness.
[time=1393] Paul doesn't say to go out and look for men who are tall, dark and handsome and put them into leadership of the church.
[time=1399] He doesn't say to go out and find the successful business people and put them into leadership in your church.
[time=1404] He doesn't say to go out and find those with great physical stature or those who are in great physical shape and put them in leadership in your church or those who make a great impression.
[time=1415] In other words, leadership in the church is not qualified by giftedness whether natural or spiritual.
[time=1420] It is not qualified by some natural charisma a person may have even a level of education or even age.
[time=1427] Men are qualified for ministry, leadership in the church by their character.
[time=1432] A character that is above reproach.
[time=1435] Three categories fall to us in these verses and they are all relational.
[time=1440] The first major category is that of the husband and his wife.
[time=1444] And you remember we've said that that might better be translated the one woman man as opposed to the husband of one wife.
[time=1452] If we take that phrase to refer to the marital status it stops becoming a spiritual qualification and it starts becoming just a mere issue of status.
[time=1462] There are unbelievers who can qualify if we leave it the husband of one wife.
[time=1466] There are people who don't know Christ, who don't belong in the church because they don't even know Christ who certainly are the husband of one wife who only had one wife and have had that one wife for fifty years.
[time=1477] I don't believe that's what this phrase is saying.
[time=1479] It doesn't relegate spirituality to an external condition.
[time=1482] Instead I believe it says and can be translated a one woman man.
[time=1487] A one woman man which stops talking only about marital status and starts talking about the condition of a man's heart.
[time=1495] Is he completely and totally devoted to the woman who is his wife?
[time=1500] That is a spiritual qualification.
[time=1502] That as our Lord said in Matthew chapter 5 is a man who does not lust after a woman for him in his heart thereby committing adultery with her.
[time=1511] A man even in the church, a Christian man, a man who is even in leadership can qualify if it's just an external status issue the husband of one wife may have only had and has only one wife but may be having an affair with some other woman.
[time=1526] Certainly doesn't qualify him.
[time=1528] It is an issue of the heart.
[time=1530] It is an issue of simplicity and devotion to the woman he is married to.
[time=1536] It also doesn't restrict men who are single from being elders in the church.
[time=1540] Paul himself was single at this time in his life and he himself calls himself an elder.
[time=1546] And so obviously this phrase can't mean you have to be married.
[time=1550] This phrase is all about the disposition of the heart and the devotion and dedication of a man to his wife.
[time=1554] And if he isn't married then he's not a ladies man.
[time=1557] He's not a man running around looking for a woman.
[time=1561] We found the second major category to be that of his household.
[time=1565] Look at verse 4.
[time=1567] He must be one who manages his own household well meaning that this next sphere of relationship is the grounds on which he is qualified.
[time=1576] The most intimate that with his wife begins the whole list and then Paul brings in to view how his children respond to his leadership.
[time=1583] And we'll look at that as we move through the text.
[time=1586] The third level of evaluation or the third category of above reproachness in a general way is found in verse 7.
[time=1592] He must have a good reputation with those outside the church.
[time=1596] The people who view him in the community, the people from whom he buys his cars, his grocery, his gas, the people he works with, the people who live on that street, the people who are not saved, those who are outside the church.
[time=1608] They must think highly of him.
[time=1610] He must have a good reputation with them.
[time=1613] So we see the qualifications to be relational.
[time=1616] We see that a man is qualified for ministry, not based on some length of time that he's been in a particular ministry
[time=1626] or some position that he's held or even how much of the Bible he knows.
[time=1630] These don't qualify, man.
[time=1632] It is, as Paul has said, the goal of our instruction is love.
[time=1635] Love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
[time=1639] It's the product of the knowledge of the Word of God that qualifies a man for ministry.
[time=1643] It's the evidence of godliness in his life and the way he treats his wife, his children, and the unsaved in his community that qualify him.
[time=1651] Well, then we backed up and we're taking a little longer look at each one of these qualifications.
[time=1656] We've talked about the husband of one wife and then in verse 2, he is temperant, prudent, respectable, and hospitable.
[time=1663] We looked at those last week and just briefly, a temperant man is a balanced man.
[time=1668] A prudent man is a man who has self-control of himself.
[time=1672] A respectable man is one who is organized.
[time=1674] His life is not full of unaccomplished plans and unorganized activities.
[time=1679] And then he is hospitable.
[time=1681] Two words in the Greek come together to make that English word hospitable, a stranger of lovers.
[time=1687] Excuse me, a lover of strangers.
[time=1690] That'd be quite a disqualification, wouldn't it?
[time=1695] He is qualified for leadership because he loves strangers.
[time=1699] He is able to open his home to people he doesn't even know.
[time=1703] Some of them are Christians and in the ancient world they would have come from distant places traveling in ministry or business.
[time=1710] And they wouldn't have frequented the ends of that day which were primarily given to prostitution and liquor and alcohol and all the rest and it would be unfit for them to stay there.
[time=1719] And so they would find Christians and these elders would be the kind of men who would say, "I've never met you before, I don't know where you're from, but you're a believer, come on in.
[time=1727] I'll give you shelter, I'll give you food." These men would also do that to unbelievers as well.
[time=1732] They would exemplify the treatment of the good Samaritan and be open in their heart and their resources and their life even to unbelievers.
[time=1740] So they have a love for strangers and that by way of review.
[time=1744] Now we come this morning to new material.
[time=1746] Chapter three, verse two, the very end of it.
[time=1749] You'll find that the elder is able to teach.
[time=1754] Able to teach.
[time=1755] He is skilled at teaching.
[time=1757] He is skilled at communicating the word of God.
[time=1762] And what appears here is just a small phrase, able to teach is really a theme.
[time=1767] It is a dominant theme in the ministry of an elder or a pastor, an overseer.
[time=1773] And I've talked about this with you before so I don't want to be labor the point.
[time=1776] But let me walk with you through Timothy and then through second Timothy and then through Titus just to reestablish this in our thinking.
[time=1784] These three books are called the pastoral epistles.
[time=1787] These are the epistles that are written to pastors, men who are elders, overseers.
[time=1791] And just walk with me, if you will, we'll turn a few pages and just be reminded of how important this function is in the elder's life.
[time=1798] Chapter four, verse six.
[time=1801] Verse 10 of the four, verse six, in pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of faith and of sound doctrine in which you have been following.
[time=1814] Verse 11, prescribe and teach these things.
[time=1820] Verse 13, until I come, give attention to the public reading of Scripture
[time=1826] to exhortation and teaching.
[time=1829] Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you.
[time=1831] He's making reference to the gift of teaching and preaching, which was bestowed upon you through the prophetic utterance with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
[time=1839] Verse 15, take pains with these things.
[time=1842] Be absorbed in them so that your progress may be evident to all.
[time=1846] Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching.
[time=1851] Persevere in these things.
[time=1852] For as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.
[time=1859] Look at chapter five, verse 17.
[time=1862] Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
[time=1871] That word, work hard, could be translated to the point of exhaustion.
[time=1876] The elder is one who should give himself to the ministry of the Word of God, to studying the Word of God, to the point of exhaustion.
[time=1883] If he's tired and he needs a break, it should be because he's been studying the Bible too much.
[time=1889] He should be to the point of exhaustion, not from frivolous activity and extraneous things, but from the consistent, faithful study of the Word of God.
[time=1898] It should wear him out.
[time=1900] Then come with me to second Timothy.
[time=1902] Second Timothy, chapter one.
[time=1905] And look at verse 13.
[time=1907] Chapter one, verse 13.
[time=1909] "Just retain the standard of sound words which you have heard from me in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus." Again, the standard of sound words.
[time=1920] Chapter two, verse two.
[time=1922] "And these things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also."
[time=1932] So the whole process of propagating the faith from one generation to the next comes because godly men who are committed to the Word of God teach other men who teach other men who teach other men who teach other men and all those men teach the family of God.
[time=1946] That is how the sound doctrine is preserved and held unto.
[time=1951] Then, chapter two, verse 15.
[time=1954] And this is a theme for a "wana" which we'll celebrate tonight.
[time=1958] Thankful for that ministry because it does just this.
[time=1961] Be diligent, verse 15, "to present yourselves approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, handling accurately the Word of truth." These are people who, like a craftsman, can go into his shop and he has many tools and many machines and he has the raw material of the wood.
[time=1981] He is approved, he is a workman, he is a skilled craftsman and what he produces is a work of art.
[time=1987] It's beautiful and it's true to its design.
[time=1990] And so it is with the man of God who would be approved to God as a workman not needing to be ashamed.
[time=1996] He can move in and through the scriptures and teach it accurately and he is consistent with its understanding of itself and he presents doctrine in clear fashion and presents that to the body of believers so that the truth is guarded and held unto.
[time=2012] One other passage, let's go to Titus, the last of the pastoral epistles.
[time=2018] In that first chapter, Titus chapter 1.
[time=2022] And look at, he's giving here the same kind of qualifications.
[time=2026] This is another qualification for leadership in the church.
[time=2029] There are two of them.
[time=2030] We're looking at one of them in 1 Timothy 3.
[time=2032] This is the second time it's pretty much reiterated, verses 5 through 9.
[time=2037] Look at verse 5, chapter 1.
[time=2039] For this reason I left you in Crete now speaking to Titus, not Timothy, that you might set in order what remains and appoint elders in every city as I directed you.
[time=2050] Then verse 6, namely if any man be above approach and then it goes, right?
[time=2054] Just like it does in Timothy.
[time=2056] Now come to verse 9.
[time=2058] Holding fast, the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching
[time=2064] that he may be able both to exhort and sound doctrine and refute those who contradict.
[time=2071] This word holding fast is a tenacious clinging to the word of God in the face of fierce opposition to the truth of the word of God.
[time=2082] This describes an elder who is willing to cling to the truth of the word of God in despite what might be a popular view or a popular movement in the church.
[time=2091] He's willing to hang on to the truth of God.
[time=2094] And many times he'll hold on to that in the face of opposition coming from outside the church itself, persecution, and sometimes it would take these men to their death.
[time=2104] They are totally committed to the word of God holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching.
[time=2111] Notice in verse 9 that it says that they may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, to exhort paracaleo, to call near.
[time=2120] These men are so familiar with the word of God and so committed to it that they have the ability to in private conversation or publicly to draw people near to examine the word of God and to see for themselves what it says.
[time=2133] If we had time we could go through the New Testament and find that word's usage paracaleo with respect to the teaching ministry.
[time=2140] You'd find in Acts chapter 2 that it's a form of persuasion.
[time=2144] They are whimsical.
[time=2145] They draw people into the truth of the word of God.
[time=2148] In 2 Corinthians 8 17 it's a pleading type of paracaleo where there is a passion in their heart and they are just pleading with people to obey and to respond to the word of God.
[time=2159] In 1 Thessalonians 2 it's a paracaleo of comfort.
[time=2163] They can use the word of God as an ointment to salve the wounds, the spiritual wounds that have been inflicted by the world on the sheep.
[time=2171] And it's a source of comfort.
[time=2173] 1 Thessalonians 4-1 the paracaleo there is that of encouragement and there is an energy in the communication.
[time=2180] There is an uplifting desire that comes out of that to live the word of God and to be faithful to Him.
[time=2186] 2 Timothy 4-2 this paracaleo is a patient reiterating of important doctrine.
[time=2193] The elder is willing to go over it and over it and over it and over it and over it again because oftentimes people forget 80% of what they hear and so they properly review and go through it again and say it different ways and try to get it deeply embedded into the hearts of the people because they must have the truth.
[time=2211] So all of that under the heading of exhort and sound doctrine, that's what these guys do.
[time=2216] That's why they're in leadership.
[time=2217] They have a capacity to do that.
[time=2219] They've been gifted by the Lord for that.
[time=2222] Look at again at verse 9 both to exhort and sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict.
[time=2228] The word refute talks about again the battle as they face off with the arch enemy of the church, namely Satan, as he spins his webs of lies and all different forms and all different fashions and he feeds them into the church, sometimes through the ungodly character, sometimes through even believers who want to justify their own behavior and they come up with crazy things to say about the word of God.
[time=2250] They refute that.
[time=2252] They say that is not true.
[time=2254] That is wrong.
[time=2255] Stop that teaching and they do battle against false doctrine.
[time=2261] So just even here in these three books, the pastorals, we find over and over and over again the dominant theme of the elders' responsibility is tied to the word of God, to defending the word of God, to teaching the word of God.
[time=2275] Come on back now to 1 Timothy chapter 3.
[time=2280] And I want you to notice that in this list of some 20 qualifications, this is really the only function there.
[time=2289] This is the only thing he's got to be able to do.
[time=2292] Everything else he is somebody.
[time=2294] He is a man who is a one woman man.
[time=2296] He is a man who is temperate.
[time=2298] That describes who he is, but able to teach describes his function.
[time=2302] And you say, why?
[time=2304] Why in the middle of a list of things that describe a man's character
[time=2310] is they're a function listed.
[time=2312] Why does it come that way?
[time=2314] Well, I don't know for sure.
[time=2316] But I'll suggest to you that it's there because a man's ability to teach
[time=2322] is directly related to the character in his life.
[time=2328] Because teaching effectively is predicated on the character of the teacher.
[time=2336] You can't divorce what a teacher is from what he says when the whole content of his teaching is moral as the word of God is.
[time=2344] In other words, if a man doesn't live what he preaches, he effectively unsays with his life everything he has said with his lips.
[time=2352] And so there's a list of qualifications that are character and then stuck somewhere in the middle.
[time=2357] There is this ability to teach.
[time=2358] In other words, you're not able to teach a godliness unless you're able to live godliness.
[time=2364] Because if you only talk godliness but don't live godliness, you unsay everything with your life.
[time=2372] The 17th century Puritan Richard Baxter said it very well.
[time=2377] He said this, "Take heed to yourselves, lest your example contradict your doctrine.
[time=2383] Lest you unsay with your lives, what you say with your tongues, and be the greatest hindrance of the success of your own labors.
[time=2393] One proud, lordly word, one needless contention, one covetous action may cut the throat of many a sermon and blast the fruit of all that you have been doing."
[time=2407] So in the middle of character qualities, there comes this one function able to teach because it is so tied.
[time=2415] It is so tied the one with the other.
[time=2420] First Timothy 4, verse 11, you remember we just looked at it, prescribed and teach these things, look what comes next.
[time=2427] Look at verse 12, what's it say?
[time=2431] Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity show yourself an example of those who believe.
[time=2440] They're tied, inextricably tied.
[time=2442] To preach and teach these things requires that you show yourself an example in all of those categories.
[time=2451] Turn the page, if you would, or in my Bible it's a page.
[time=2454] Go to verse 16.
[time=2457] Pay close attention to what?
[time=2460] Yourself and to your teaching.
[time=2463] Persevere in these things for as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourselves and for those who hear you.
[time=2469] In other words, over and over and over and over again, the character of a man is tied to the teaching of the man and they can't be divorced because if they are, nothing good comes of it.
[time=2479] Everything he says with his lips is unsaid with his life.
[time=2484] Well enough said, more could be said, we could follow through the New Testament and find the importance of preaching and teaching, but I believe we've done that sufficiently under the women's series, and so we'll move to the next group of categories.
[time=2497] Look at them in verse 3, 1 Timothy 3-3.
[time=2501] There are five of them here, but I believe they're tied together.
[time=2506] In verse 3, not addicted to wine, that's one of them, pugnacious, gentle, uncontentious and free from the love of money.
[time=2516] You say, how are they related? Why are they grouped?
[time=2519] Because it describes people who are not in control of themselves.
[time=2522] They're under the influence of something else.
[time=2526] The first one is, they're under the influence of alcohol.
[time=2530] The second one, which I find here, would be in pugnacious and gentle and uncontentious.
[time=2536] This is people who are given to fighting.
[time=2539] Given to fighting, if you're pugnacious, you're a fighter.
[time=2542] If you're uncontentious, you're not a fighter.
[time=2545] If you are a contentious, you are a fighter.
[time=2547] And I say these men are under the control of anger.
[time=2550] These men have given up the control of their life, not to alcohol, but to their own anger.
[time=2554] And then in verse 3, the end of it, free from the love of money, these men are under the control of money or the dollar.
[time=2561] So the disqualification in all of these is that the interests of the church will not be pursued by these men or this man because he is under the influence of something other than the Holy Spirit and the Word of God.
[time=2574] In that he's addicted to wine, literally means he's beside wine.
[time=2578] He lingers along with wine, he's addicted, he's an alcoholic, he's dependent on the alcohol.
[time=2584] That has become his God.
[time=2586] Alcohol is his Lord.
[time=2588] It is the preoccupying reality of his life.
[time=2591] It has ruined him for he can no longer act on principle, conviction, and moral resolve.
[time=2597] Instead, the guiding light of his life is alcohol.
[time=2601] When do I get my next drink?
[time=2605] Men like that are not to lead the church.
[time=2607] They are not clear headed.
[time=2608] They are not capable of looking at a situation objectively, even in their own life, much less the lives of everybody else.
[time=2614] They're not under the control of God, they're under the control of alcohol.
[time=2618] Then the second disqualifying thing, pugnacious, that literally means a striker, one who gives blows, one who is quick with his fists.
[time=2629] When provoked, he's ready to duke it out in a physical literal way.
[time=2633] A contentious man, the opposite of unconscious, a contentious man doesn't use his fists to fight.
[time=2640] His lips and arguments and the landscape of his life is littered with arguments, littered with people he can't get along with.
[time=2646] Everywhere he looks, he has arguments and there's strife and there's contention and there's things that shouldn't be there.
[time=2652] He can't get along with anybody.
[time=2654] The opposite of both of those is right in the middle of it.
[time=2657] He's gracious.
[time=2660] He's gentle, which means he's willing to give up his rights.
[time=2663] It's a forbearing spirit.
[time=2665] Really, you can offend him deeply and profoundly.
[time=2667] And he doesn't rise to the occasion and demand his rights.
[time=2670] He thinks clearly about the situation and takes action which would promote the kingdom of God.
[time=2674] Sometimes he stands up for his rights, sometimes he doesn't.
[time=2677] But he's not driven by anger.
[time=2679] What calls his shots in those difficult trying situations where he is being challenged or is teaching is being challenged or his family is being challenged is what would advance the kingdom of God.
[time=2688] He is under control of himself.
[time=2691] These other men are quick to explode in a tirade of anger.
[time=2695] Sometimes though they are slow burners and when they are angered by you you barely know it.
[time=2700] They take it inside of them and they look for subtle and manipulative ways to vent their anger and are equally destructive in the church.
[time=2709] They have track records for disagreement with everyone in their life.
[time=2713] They're absolutely dominated by their anger.
[time=2715] It has become the energy of their life.
[time=2717] They go from one argument and disagreement to the next.
[time=2720] And without an argument, without a good fight, they don't know why to get up in the morning.
[time=2724] There's no energy, there's no positive thing happening in their life.
[time=2727] They're basically reacting from argument to argument to argument.
[time=2732] And as we have said that man is disqualified.
[time=2734] He is unqualified for leadership because he won't be in the church to lead the church.
[time=2738] He'll be in the church to look for a fight and he'll fight about the color of the building or he'll fight about the carpet or he'll fight about some doctrine or he'll fight about some implementation of some policy but you can bet he'll find a fight.
[time=2749] And he won't care how it impacts the church and he won't care how it's taught in the word all he wants is an issue and an argument.
[time=2757] And if you've ever had an elder like that, you're thankful when his term is up because you can't go anywhere.
[time=2765] And I'm thankful that I don't know of one like that here.
[time=2770] We have godly men.
[time=2771] I love to hear them use the word yield.
[time=2774] They'll yield.
[time=2775] What's great about our elder meetings is we can disagree with each other.
[time=2778] We can open the word of God.
[time=2779] We can talk different perspectives.
[time=2781] We can offer different opinions and perspective.
[time=2784] And at the end, we can come together and say, "But this is the way we're going to go." And those who were opposing say, "Well, that's fine with me.
[time=2790] I just wanted to make sure you knew my perspective and I'll yield to that." And then you find weeks down the road and months down the road, these men are faithful to that and they stay with what they said they would do and they support that general direction.
[time=2802] That's godliness.
[time=2803] Godliness isn't always right being right.
[time=2805] Godliness isn't always knowing the answer and having to force it and making everybody comply to it.
[time=2811] Godliness is the ability to yield with maturity for the sake of the greater good.
[time=2818] 2 Timothy 2, 24, I'll just read it to you.
[time=2821] It couldn't be any planer.
[time=2823] It says this, "And the Lord's bond service must not be quarrelsome but be kind to all, able to teach, patient went wrong with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition.
[time=2834] If perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth." And that's the whole point.
[time=2841] When you're being disagreed with, it's not to get your point clear.
[time=2844] It's to win the person back to obedience to Christ.
[time=2847] And sometimes that rigid agitated fighting quarrelsome attitude does the exact opposite and you may be exactly right with the word of God but you push everybody away with your attitude.
[time=2858] So men who would lead the church are not to be that way, not quick to blows, not fighting and full of strife but instead they are gentle.
[time=2867] They will give up their rights in fact if that advances the kingdom of God.
[time=2871] And then this last one, the lover of money, free from the love of money.
[time=2877] Literally it's fond of silver, they love the stuff.
[time=2880] It has become the controlling dictate and monarch of their life.
[time=2884] Jesus said you can't serve God and Mammon at the same time, it's impossible.
[time=2890] And if you've given your life to the service of money, if that has become your God, if you're enslaved to it then you have no place leading the church.
[time=2899] Because all of your decisions, all of your way of thinking about the church and financial matters in the church and will be skewed terribly by that love.
[time=2909] These are not people who we see walking down the street with some ball and chain with money attached to the end of it.
[time=2916] But it's not always obvious, it's a slavery of the heart, it's a slavery of the mind, it covers and impermeates all of his thinking about every decision, whether it's new shoes for his kid or a new house or a savings account or how much they'll give to the church that year or whatever.
[time=2932] It is the guiding principle in all their thinking, the love of money.
[time=2937] And what should be the guiding principle in all of those decisions and choices is the love of God.
[time=2941] This is his money, how does he want me to spend it?
[time=2944] So it is a slavery of heart and mind to money itself.
[time=2949] It is the guiding factor in all their decisions.
[time=2953] Now I want to add that this does not mean that an elder cannot be blessed by God financially.
[time=2960] This does not mean that only poor people can serve as elders.
[time=2964] This does not mean that if a man has been blessed by God with financial well-being, that he is therefore disqualified from leadership.
[time=2972] It's not what it says, it's a matter not of your income but of your motive.
[time=2977] It's the hanging on and loving after and seeking money that is the disqualifying factor, not the fact that you happen to have some.
[time=2985] And I believe that the amount of money that we have as individuals is just as sovereignly given as gifts.
[time=2992] Some people have more than others because that's how God designed it.
[time=2996] Now certainly there is this principle if you don't work, you don't eat, and if you don't work, you can bet you won't have any money unless you inherited it.
[time=3003] But beyond that general principle, God just sovereignly gives some people more money than he does others.
[time=3008] And it's not a spiritual qualification negatively or positively.
[time=3012] There are poor people, there are people with very little money, people who have difficulty paying the monthly bills
[time=3018] in a very basic lifestyle who love money.
[time=3022] And they are disqualified, they don't have any, but they love it.
[time=3026] That's the disqualifying part.
[time=3028] And there are others who have tons of money, more money than they could know what to do with and don't love it, haven't fixed their affections on it.
[time=3037] And use it wisely and dispense it as God would have them and they're qualified.
[time=3042] And the inverse could be true, people with none may not love it and therefore are qualified and people with tons may love it and therefore are disqualified.
[time=3050] It's the motive of the heart.
[time=3052] And what is so critical about it is if you've given your heart to money, you're blind, you can't see.
[time=3060] Spiritual discernment is gone and you'll be of no use to leading the church.
[time=3067] The passage comes to my mind about money and about its blinding impact.
[time=3074] It says this, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
[time=3081] But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys where thieves do not break in or steal.
[time=3087] For where your treasure is what?
[time=3089] There will your heart be also." And then he gives an illustration of that.
[time=3093] The lamp of the body is the eye.
[time=3096] If therefore your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light.
[time=3100] If your eyes are working, if your eyes are functioning, if they're taking in light and responding those signals to the brain, your body is full of light and you direct your course with wisdom and you don't fall into the ditch and you don't walk into the wall and all the other things that blind people have to contend with.
[time=3116] That's the description of someone who is laying up their treasures in heaven.
[time=3120] They've got clear eyesight spiritually.
[time=3123] But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.
[time=3128] If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness?
[time=3133] And parallel is obvious.
[time=3134] If you're blind physically, you can't see, you're just stumbling into everything.
[time=3138] People who have given their lives to the pursuit of money are blinded spiritually.
[time=3143] They may be saved, but at some measure they cannot have or they do not have the spiritual discernment that others who haven't given themselves to that do.
[time=3152] And then he concludes his statement with this.
[time=3155] "No one can serve two masters.
[time=3157] For either he will hate the one and love the other, and he will hold to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon." And so here he puts these affections at direct opposite to each other.
[time=3169] They're not compatible.
[time=3172] They are in opposition to each other.
[time=3179] So those who would lead the church must be free from the love of money.
[time=3187] As we close, let me give a few points of application to what we've tried to say today.
[time=3192] We'll come back next week, and I want to spend a little time on this next qualification.
[time=3198] He manages his household well.
[time=3200] No need to rush through that.
[time=3202] That's critical.
[time=3204] And then we'll talk about the reputation with those outside the church.
[time=3207] But let me say this, first of all, by way of application.
[time=3209] Number one, you can't get it any clearer.
[time=3212] It can't be any more obvious in Scripture that the people who are to lead the church will be profoundly grounded in the Word of God.
[time=3219] Able to teach.
[time=3221] Given to the Word of God.
[time=3222] And I just want to offer a few suggestions on how to get there.
[time=3225] If you're not there, if you're not where you want to be in your study of the Word of God, if you feel like that would be a disqualification for you and you say, "How can I change that?" Whether you want to be an elder or you just want to be a godly mature Christian, let me give you this suggestion.
[time=3240] Pick a book of the Bible and read it 30 times, once every day for a month.
[time=3248] Same book.
[time=3249] And if it's a big book like Matthew, read the first five chapters for the first month.
[time=3255] Chapters one through five, day one, then day two, then day three.
[time=3259] Just read it over and over until you read it 30 times.
[time=3261] Then take the next five chapters in that book.
[time=3263] Then take the next five chapters in that book and then you're almost finished.
[time=3267] Move on through till you're finished with the entire book of Matthew.
[time=3270] Take you to four or five months.
[time=3272] When you're done doing that, guess what you know?
[time=3275] Matthew, you've read it so many times.
[time=3280] Not only do you know it, but you can see it in your head.
[time=3284] You can see that chapter one starts on the right page, left hand column at the top.
[time=3290] You can see that Jesus' discussion about not committing adultery with a woman in her heart is on the right hand page in the middle section of the left hand column.
[time=3299] You know the word of God.
[time=3301] You can see it in your mind's eye.
[time=3303] And as you're reading it over and over and over and over and over again, pick up a commentary and find out, well, why was this book written?
[time=3310] Why did Matthew write Matthew?
[time=3313] He wrote Matthew to present Christ as king and his kingdom offer.
[time=3317] And then begin to relate all the contents of that book back to that one central theme.
[time=3321] And it'll all start to flow in your mind, and you'll be able to walk from chapter to chapter to chapter to chapter to chapter to chapter with the content, making its obvious contribution to the great theme of the book.
[time=3330] That's called knowing Matthew.
[time=3332] If you find something along the way that really sparks your interest, then get a commentary out and learn about that little part of that detail.
[time=3337] But don't be moved from the vast scope and movement of that book.
[time=3341] When you're done with that, do Romans.
[time=3346] And when you're done with that, do Revelation. Four New Testament books.
[time=3350] From Matthew, you'll learn all about Christ and the kingdom program.
[time=3354] From Romans, you'll learn all the doctrine you could ever want to know.
[time=3358] From Ephesians, you'll learn about the church.
[time=3361] And from the Revelation, you'll learn about the end of the age.
[time=3365] If you were to do that, it might take you a year, maybe a little longer.
[time=3369] Five chapters every day, augment it with some peripheral study.
[time=3373] You're going to know the Bible.
[time=3375] You're going to know the Bible better than 90% of the people in the world alive today.
[time=3379] It's not that hard.
[time=3383] It just takes some kind of commitment to do that.
[time=3386] And then one of the thought for you, find somebody to teach.
[time=3390] Find somebody.
