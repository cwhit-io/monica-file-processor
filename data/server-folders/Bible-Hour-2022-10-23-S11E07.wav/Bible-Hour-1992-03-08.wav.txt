[time=0] And so this morning we come back to take a final look at what Paul says are
[time=6] qualifications for leadership. And the qualification we have in view this morning
[time=12] is that an elder must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity. The question is asked if a man is
[time=23] nominated for the position of eldership in the church, would his children vote for him? Well examine that in great detail this morning.
[time=33] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we
[time=49] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] Today Pastor Moore will be concluding his series of messages on church leadership from 1 Timothy chapter 3. We have all heard stories of men who have become great leaders in business or government but who have failed at home to be good fathers and husbands. For those who aspire to lead in the church God's word states that they must manage their family well and be respected by their children. If you are nominated for the church leadership would your children vote for you? We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Timothy chapter 3 so that you will be prepared to study along with us.
[time=88] Our special music today will include a song from Becky Woman entitled "There is Peace" and just before the message our handbell choir will present a number entitled "Two Meditations from the Cross." As we prepare for our time of Bible
[time=104] study let's begin our time of worship and meditation as our sanctuary choir presents "Thou Art Worthy."
[time=113] [MUSIC]
[time=136] "Thou Art Worthy."
[time=168] "Thou Art Worthy." "Thou Art Worthy." "Thou Art Worthy." "Thou Art Worthy."
[time=218] "Thou Art Worthy."
[time=355] [APPLAUSE]
[time=361] [MUSIC - 319 seconds]
[time=687] Hello, and welcome to the Bible Hour today, Russell.
[time=689] This is another Lord's Day, and we look forward to great things that are happening as we worship together.
[time=694] Well, it is. It's just an absolute joy to anticipate Sunday, and to know we'll be in the house of the Lord with God's people and worshiping Him and praising Him.
[time=702] If you were watching or looked for the Bible Hour last week on Channel 21, our local station here in Fort Wayne,
[time=708] you no doubt realize that we were preempted by the Easter Seal Telethon.
[time=712] There were a number of our choir members and young people that were involved behind the phones in that great campaign,
[time=719] and we're glad that you've tuned in again today for our program.
[time=723] There are some special events coming up in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church, Russell, a lot of times people ask me, "Do we have other formats besides what they see on television here at the church?"
[time=733] And much of our other types of activities are done in our evening service.
[time=737] One such event is the Children's Musical put on by the Praise Kids.
[time=742] That's grades 4, 5, and 6.
[time=745] On Sunday evening, March 22, they'll be presenting Salvation Celebration.
[time=752] A great evening of music and drama by these kids.
[time=755] Russell, they really get into it.
[time=757] They learn a lot of scripture, good music, and it's a really exciting time.
[time=761] Well, it's absolutely captivated.
[time=763] My eldest daughter, Randy, who is a part of this musical, and she just sings the music all the time, and she's so excited.
[time=768] She comes to play practice or musical practice every Sunday afternoon, wouldn't miss it.
[time=773] You know, they just get so involved.
[time=775] And I'm thankful for these kinds of ministries at our church that reinforce the values in our kids' lives.
[time=782] Let me just give you that date again.
[time=784] That Sunday evening, March 22, it's 6 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=789] Come and join with us for the Children's Musical Salvation Celebration.
[time=794] And then, as we've done for a number of years, we're going to have a good Friday service at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=802] Russell, this will be your first time.
[time=804] We have a half-hour program there. It's rather limited.
[time=806] But we do involve it during the lunch hour.
[time=810] So many of our people that work downtown can invite some of their friends.
[time=814] Yeah, and that is the idea.
[time=816] What a tremendous opportunity to bring the significance of Christ to people at that time of the year.
[time=821] And I'm thankful we can do that all year long.
[time=823] I was learning from some of the people in our church even this week.
[time=827] One of our visitation calls on Wednesday night, somebody prayed to receive Christ as their Savior and another man that works in one of the businesses here in town sharing the gospel with one of the janitors where he works and that person came to know Christ.
[time=842] It's exciting to see us embracing Christ and sharing Christ.
[time=846] And this will be a great event as well in that process.
[time=849] You know, our young people are getting ready to go down to Florida for the annual operation outreach and they are training.
[time=856] And I know some of our young people, my son, went to the mall and witnessed last week.
[time=861] And that's really exciting because, yes, it is.
[time=863] It's Easter for us all the time.
[time=865] This will be a special date and we want you to put it on your calendar.
[time=869] Good Friday is April 17th and it will be from 1215 to 1245
[time=875] at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=878] Please note that and come and join with us for this wonderful service.
[time=882] And then for the Easter program here at Blackhawk Baptist Church we'll be presenting it twice on Saturday evening April 18th and Sunday evening April 19th.
[time=891] On Saturday evening it will be at 7 p.m. Sunday evening 6 p.m.
[time=896] and the drama is Spark in Judea.
[time=899] And if you'd like to learn more about that, let me give you the telephone number where you can call into the office and we'll give you some more information about tickets.
[time=907] You can call 493 7400 and the area code is 219.
[time=913] Those are very exciting events that will inspire you during this Easter season.
[time=918] I hope you'll come and join with us.
[time=920] And then last week we began offering to you the book that entitled "God's Promises for Your Every Need." Here are some topics that will really help you with your spiritual life.
[time=930] Topics such as courage, issues about worry and stress in your life, scripture verses that will encourage you for all of those circumstances.
[time=939] I hope that you'll write for this wonderful book right now.
[time=942] Right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=950] Just ask for God's Promises, and once again the address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=962] We're going to go back now to some more music and then the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore. Stay tuned with us for some inspiration from God's Word.
[time=997] [MUSIC - 113 seconds]
[time=1120] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1130] Boy, that's great. This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine.
[time=1134] It's also good to know that our church is doing that on a regular basis.
[time=1139] I'm always so excited to continue to hear the reports of how we let our light shine in the community.
[time=1143] Two of them this week came to me, one from one of our EE teams on a Wednesday night was out sharing the gospel and a person prayed to receive Christ, and now that light shines in their heart as well.
[time=1154] Heard from another man in our family, our fellowship here, a part of our church who was sharing the gospel with one of the janitors where he works, and that janitor prayed to receive Christ.
[time=1164] And so it's neat that we not only play the songs, but we live the reality and we're seeing the light of Jesus Christ beaming forth from this church by God's grace.
[time=1174] Well, about 130 years ago, back when the wild west was still wild
[time=1181] and before the telegraph really connected the west coast with the east coast and vice versa,
[time=1188] back when it took about three months for a letter to get from the east coast out to California, partly because it had to go by sea and then by barge and then by mule, three men by the name of Russell, Majors, and Waddle.
[time=1201] It came up with a great idea to get the mail from basically Nebraska to Sacramento guaranteed ten days.
[time=1209] They called it the Pony Express.
[time=1212] In order to do this great new venture, they needed men.
[time=1215] And they ran an ad and it ran this way, wanted.
[time=1218] Young, skinny, wiry fellows, not over 18, must be expert riders willing to risk death daily,
[time=1228] orphans preferred, wages $25 per week.
[time=1235] Well, more than 100 men immediately responded, no doubt excited by the romance of running away
[time=1241] from Indians while speeding across the frontier on horseback.
[time=1246] One of the young men that responded was Buffalo Bill Cody.
[time=1252] He was 14 years of age.
[time=1254] But the Overland Express, as the company was called, would not allow them to carry even one piece of mail
[time=1262] until they first pledged themselves to be men above reproach.
[time=1267] Each had to take the vow, and this is the one that Buffalo Bill Cody took at the age of 14 years.
[time=1273] I, William Cody, do hereby swear, before the great and living God, that during my engagement, and while I am in employee of Russell Majors and Waddle,
[time=1285] I will under no circumstances use profane language that I will drink, no intoxicating liquors, that I will not quarrel or fight with any other employee of the firm
[time=1295] and that in every respect I will conduct myself, honestly, be faithful to my duties and so direct all my acts as to win the confidence of my employers,
[time=1305] so help me God.
[time=1308] And having taken that pledge to be above reproach, he was given a job and did it faithfully, so far as we know.
[time=1316] Well, God has been trying to deliver the mail, not for just 130 years, but for centuries.
[time=1321] You hold it in your hands today. It's a composition of letters.
[time=1324] Letters that are all inspired by the Word of God, written by over 40 different authors, and the one we look at today is the letter First Timothy.
[time=1333] So if you have your Bible, let me ask you to turn there. First Timothy chapter 3.
[time=1338] And we have in view this morning men who would carry this letter, not just the actual letter in parchment,
[time=1345] but the truth of the letter in their lives, from one generation to the next.
[time=1350] And they too must take an oath. They must take an oath of being above reproach.
[time=1357] One major difference here, of course, is that while these young men were applying to be a part of the Pony Express,
[time=1363] they merely had to promise that while in the employment of the Pony Express, they would keep this code of behavior.
[time=1369] Yet what we have here in this list of qualifications that Paul gives to Timothy isn't a promise I will abstain,
[time=1377] or I will be like this list. It is, in fact, I already am.
[time=1381] I already have been living this way. I already am qualified.
[time=1385] But they're called not writers of horseback, but overseers, chapter 3, verse 1.
[time=1391] Overseers, otherwise known as elders or pastors, sometimes paid by the church, and sometimes paid by a firm or some other place, and yet they offer their leadership voluntarily to the church free of charge.
[time=1405] The number one part of their oath, the number one qualification, the overarching phrase that really captures everything that follows
[time=1412] is this idea of being above reproach, and it means that someone can't take a hold of anything in your life.
[time=1419] There's nothing major or significant in your life that would be enough for them to get a good grip on it and say, "Nope, this person is not qualified to lead the church." We've seen that that falls under three major categories, and they're all relational.
[time=1434] The first is found in chapter 3, verse 2, the husband of one wife.
[time=1440] The first relational area that we are to examine these men in with respect to their above reproachness
[time=1446] is how they treat their wife. Are they truly devoted to her?
[time=1449] Are they committed simple in their devotion to that one woman?
[time=1453] The second major category we come to this morning, and it's found in verse 4, he must be one who manages his own household well,
[time=1461] keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=1465] But if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God?
[time=1472] And that's what we're going to look at this morning, and I want to say it to you this way.
[time=1476] I want to give you three reasons. Three reasons why an elder must manage his own household well.
[time=1485] See if these don't make sense to you. The word manage means to stand first or to rule, to manage, to be in charge of.
[time=1494] The first reason I believe that an elder must manage his household well is this.
[time=1500] You're not a leader unless people are following you.
[time=1506] You're not a leader unless people are following you. Leadership is not a title. Leadership is not a position.
[time=1513] Leadership is not some position that some board of directors gives you. Leadership is a function.
[time=1519] And the function of leadership is influencing people to follow you.
[time=1523] If no one is following you, despite your title or your position, you're simply not leading, and you may not even be a leader.
[time=1532] So the idea that Paul is testing here is these men must be leaders of the church,
[time=1538] and first we'll find out if they're leaders in the home, the question is, are their children following them?
[time=1544] And it's tough that way. I mean, this is a very exacting examination of leadership or of qualification for church leadership,
[time=1551] because how do you know what makes a leader a leader? I mean, Hitler was a great leader.
[time=1557] A lot of people were following him. A lot of people were laying down their life for his cause and for his vision.
[time=1564] Now, we don't agree with where he was leading people or how he treated those who were following him, but in the truest sense, Adolf Hitler was a great leader because there was a great host of people not only willing to follow,
[time=1574] but willing to die for his cause, but he was short and somewhat nondescript in appearance apart from the little mustache under his nose.
[time=1583] He kind of looked odd or weird in many different pictures that you see him.
[time=1587] His style of preaching was almost fanatical and bombastic. He would rant and he would rave.
[time=1592] I mean, what about that man made him a leader? Certainly not his appearance and his style so much,
[time=1598] but somehow it all came together and people followed him.
[time=1602] In contrast to that, you could think of Abraham Lincoln. I mean, tall and kind of lanky and ugly,
[time=1608] and his facial features are large and exaggerated ears and nose and mouth,
[time=1614] and he certainly wasn't given the bombastic and aggravating, agitating speeches.
[time=1619] He was instead rather mild in his manner, but he was a leader and a great leader. People followed him.
[time=1625] Church Hill looked different than both, kind of short and stocky, and his weapon wasn't a sword.
[time=1631] It was, of course, his words. And somehow in the mystery of his personality and charisma, people followed.
[time=1638] People followed in desperate situations. So, in essence, these leaders, leaders of the church,
[time=1645] not necessarily tested in times of civil war or any other kind of world war, tested in the day-to-day grind of leading their family.
[time=1655] Leaders of the church must be able to lead their children.
[time=1660] The second reason, the second reason that elders must be able to manage their homes is this.
[time=1668] The skill required to lead the home, the skill required to lead the home, is so very much like the skill required to lead the church.
[time=1679] They are very parallel. They are very similar.
[time=1683] The skill to lead IBM is not necessarily the same kind of skill required to lead Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1690] The skill to lead a major organization, some organization that exists to make a profit, to have a profitable bottom line,
[time=1698] it potentially has a very different managerial style, and skills required there may be very different.
[time=1704] But that's not true when you compare the church and the home. There they are very similar. May I show that to you?
[time=1710] Come with me to 1 Thessalonians. 1 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[time=1719] Here Paul is describing his church leadership, and he uses terms that obviously are parallel to the home.
[time=1729] And we can gain much from his explanation of his leadership. 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 7.
[time=1737] He said, "But we proved to be gentle among you as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children,
[time=1745] having thus a fond affection for you. We were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel,
[time=1751] but also our own lives because you had become very dear to us.
[time=1756] For you recall, brother, in our labor and hardship, how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you,
[time=1762] we proclaim to you the gospel of God." At this point he says, "My leadership of the church, my involvement with the church of God,
[time=1770] was very much like the way a mother treats her children. Tender loving care, fond affection, something inside of him
[time=1778] was really in love with them and really was compassionate towards them and really cared for them.
[time=1782] In a way that a president of IBM or GE or some other major corporation would often not feel towards his employees
[time=1791] and towards the organization. There is a motherly instinct in his leadership for them.
[time=1797] He goes on, if that's the tender side, look at verse 10. Here comes a little more of the visionary directive side.
[time=1805] Verse 10, "You are witnesses and so is God, how devoutly and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers."
[time=1814] Verse 11, "Just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his own children
[time=1824] so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into his own kingdom and glory."
[time=1831] And he pictures here his role with them as a father who exhorts and encourages and implores.
[time=1838] To do what? Verse 12, "To walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you." He's lifting up the standard, he's holding up the principle of obedience, and he's calling them on to excellence
[time=1849] through his exhortation and is encouraging and is imploring to meet the standard.
[time=1854] So both are found in his heart, both are found in his life as he gives leadership.
[time=1860] Both that tender, genuine fond affection of people and the vision of the kingdom of God and all that it should be
[time=1867] and all that the people should be in light of the kingdom of God.
[time=1871] And those are to be bound up inside the leader's heart in his home first and then in his church.
[time=1882] Many men don't have this kind of commitment in the home and therefore should not lead in the church.
[time=1888] Many men do not well manage their home and therefore are not qualified.
[time=1892] Their children are out of control.
[time=1894] Their children are manipulative.
[time=1897] Their children are domineering.
[time=1899] Their children have found subtle ways to in fact control the home.
[time=1903] They are out from under the control of their father and they assume to a place of control.
[time=1908] It's never been declared, it's never been officially stated as such.
[time=1912] But if you're with these people along you can soon realize that the children are directing and running the show.
[time=1919] The children are the ones that set the schedule.
[time=1921] The children are the ones that determine what we're going to watch on television.
[time=1924] The children are the ones that determine which restaurant we're going to go to.
[time=1927] The children are the ones who say what mom's going to fix for dinner.
[time=1930] The children are the ones who determine the family schedule, even direct the budget by their demands as they want this and they want that.
[time=1938] Vacations are chosen entirely sometimes upon the whim of the child.
[time=1942] All in an effort just to somehow keep peace in the household.
[time=1946] And the father, instead of leading and taking all of these things into consideration and purposes where the family will go in light of the needs of the children and the wife just finds it a little bit easier.
[time=1956] Life works a little bit better if he'll just kind of acquiesce and follow.
[time=1961] It's not healthy.
[time=1964] Weak men produce weak homes. Weak homes produce weak churches and weak churches produce weak societies.
[time=1972] And it's everywhere in America today.
[time=1976] Children, by the way, are not the center of the home.
[time=1980] The husband-wife relationship is the center of the home.
[time=1984] That's why the home exists. That's how it came into existence.
[time=1987] A love between a man and a woman and at the center of the home and should always be at the center of the home beyond God and Christ, of course.
[time=1993] And the human level is the relationship of that husband to that wife.
[time=1997] That is the center of the whole thing.
[time=1999] You say, "Well, where do the children fit in?" Well, they're welcomed guests.
[time=2003] They're welcomed guests and they should know that.
[time=2006] They should feel warmly welcome in the home, but they are not the center of the home.
[time=2010] And that home does not exist to make them happy and to grant every women every wish.
[time=2015] And when they don't get their every women every wish and they start to make life difficult on everybody concerned.
[time=2020] And the father tends at that point to back up and acquiesce and give away his leadership.
[time=2025] He has also given away his leadership in the church.
[time=2029] Two things, I think, and here I am, a total of 33 years old with my eldest at 10.
[time=2034] So who am I to tell a lot of you people anything about raising children?
[time=2037] All right, I know that. But still, I got to preach on this passage.
[time=2043] Two things, two things in every situation that I try to give my children the very strong impression.
[time=2051] Two things in every situation where we're involved in some kind of conflict.
[time=2055] Number one, I love you. I love you very much.
[time=2060] I am committed to you as an individual.
[time=2064] I want them to be assured of that.
[time=2066] The second thing I want them to be very aware of is that there are consequences to their choices.
[time=2072] There are consequences to their choices.
[time=2075] If I am a man who says we will do this and if we don't do this, you'll be disciplined and then they don't do it and I don't discipline them.
[time=2082] They learn and begin to believe there is such a thing as a consequence less life.
[time=2087] And I couldn't love them less at that moment than to allow that to be reinforced day after day after day after day.
[time=2094] I sometimes affectionately refer myself to myself in the home as the great king Kahuna.
[time=2102] Law, I speak, you obey.
[time=2105] Why? Because they need to learn that.
[time=2108] And they need to learn that when I have spoken and they have not obeyed, there are consequences.
[time=2113] Those are usually, they know that long before that event ever occurs.
[time=2118] And I want them both to feel somehow from me that I am like this mother who tenderly cares for her own children with fond affection
[time=2127] who is well pleased to impart to them not only the gospel, but my own life.
[time=2132] I want them to feel that I'll give my life away for them, that I'm tender, that I am soft, that I care.
[time=2138] And at the same time I want them to know that as the father, the kingdom of God is at stake and they must learn that the king is in charge.
[time=2144] And while I am his earthly representative, they'd best learn to obey for there are consequences if they don't.
[time=2151] Now what consequences you choose in your home may be different than the ones that I choose in mine, but I do believe that in every situation
[time=2158] our children need to have both of those things coming at them, pedal to the metal, full throttle.
[time=2164] I love you, I'm committed to you, there are consequences to your choices.
[time=2171] Time will tell, as the more family continues to grow up in front of all of you, and we'll see how all that works.
[time=2181] So I believe there is no better place to see a man's commitment to meeting the needs of others than in his own church.
[time=2189] Does he care about his family? Does he take time to know each individual child and its bent and its peculiar nature
[time=2196] and the way that God put it together? And once he knows that, is he willing to move into that person's life with real effectiveness and support and love
[time=2204] and yet a commitment to building them for the kingdom of God? If he'll do that with his kids, he'll do that in the church.
[time=2211] If he won't do that with his kids, he won't do that in his church. That's what Paul's saying.
[time=2216] So the test is, are his children under control? Let's go back now to 1 Timothy 3 and look at a third reason.
[time=2230] It's this, the priority of the family over the church.
[time=2236] I believe that when Paul says he must be one in verse 4 who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity,
[time=2245] then he says if a man doesn't know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the church of God, he implies a priority there. He implies that the family is more important than the church.
[time=2256] A man's ministry in his home is more important than his ministry in the church. I believe that.
[time=2262] I believe that. I believe that because the Bible says that in other places as well as it implied here.
[time=2268] And I believe that as I have experienced my short time in life so far.
[time=2274] At the Masters College, as Vice President of Student Affairs there for six years, when the situation would become difficult
[time=2280] in a disciplined scenario and had gone up through the resident directors and the deans, the last stop was my office.
[time=2287] And I want to share with you, do you know who the most calloused kids were that I saw in those six years?
[time=2294] Do you know who the most resistant to the word of God were? And when I would try to use a scripture or a principle from the word of God,
[time=2300] they'd get a glazed look of hate and disdain on their face for yet another Bible verse?
[time=2308] Do you want to know who the most self-destructive kids were in their behavior, the ones that were dealing with anorexia
[time=2314] and bulimia and reckless sexual behavior and self-destructive knife slicing of their wrist-type behavior and taking of pills?
[time=2323] You want to know who by far and above led the list?
[time=2327] You know, the children of pastors.
[time=2333] The children of pastors were the most difficult calloused hardened cases we ever saw.
[time=2340] And more often than that, it was the daughters of pastors.
[time=2346] Man, and I see these girls come in and shut the door and start to tell me their story and explain to me what they're thinking.
[time=2356] And I just could see my one of four, I have a lot of options here.
[time=2361] There's a lot of room for us to have these kinds of problems.
[time=2364] One of four, I can see one of my daughters sitting there talking to now a different dean of student and she's talking about me.
[time=2372] And she's saying, "You know what, my dad loved his ministry more than he loved me."
[time=2378] How do I know that?
[time=2379] He was most excited about his ministry.
[time=2381] He spent most of his time in the ministry.
[time=2383] When there was a counseling crisis, he went.
[time=2385] When there was a medical crisis, he went.
[time=2387] When he had to finish his studies, he went.
[time=2389] And he was gone so much.
[time=2390] And then when he came home, if I was out of line, he hit me over the head with a Bible verse and said, "Get back in order because if you're not in order, I can't stay in the ministry."
[time=2400] It happened girl after girl after girl after girl.
[time=2403] Different words, different circumstances, different parts of the country, but the same story.
[time=2409] Paul is saying to men in the ministry whether paid like me or whether lay like many of our elders,
[time=2415] "Hey, let me help you out.
[time=2416] Your family is your first priority." Don't even think about sacrificing your family for the church.
[time=2427] He had a conversation with the staff about three months ago.
[time=2431] And in our staff meetings on Wednesdays are just blessed times.
[time=2434] We spend three or four hours together and we always open with a devotion.
[time=2437] And then we spend time in prayer and we pray for the needs of the church.
[time=2440] And sometimes we pray for each other on specific needs.
[time=2443] And I was feeling burdened to share a need with them about one of my daughters who I just felt like we were missing it.
[time=2451] The relationship wasn't there.
[time=2453] We weren't connecting the eye to eye stuff. There was a glazed look.
[time=2457] And I give love and it wasn't received. It was pushed away.
[time=2461] And I give discipline and it would just feel like things were being driven inside.
[time=2465] And it was very confusing and very alarming.
[time=2468] And I said, "Please guys, you need to pray for me.
[time=2470] I'm going to make some adjustments here in my schedule.
[time=2473] And I'm going to try to focus in on this one particular girl.
[time=2476] And I'm going to try to see if that won't make a little bit of a difference such that the intangible part of relationship will come back.
[time=2484] And they were faithfully praying for me.
[time=2487] And I said to them, "You know, and I'll tell you what, if these first set of adjustments in my time and priorities don't make the difference,
[time=2493] I'm going to make some more adjustments.
[time=2497] And if need me, I'm going to adjust myself completely out of the ministry."
[time=2503] Because that one little girl in her life is more important to me than any ministry in the world.
[time=2512] I think that's what he's saying.
[time=2515] Love your family. Give yourself to your family. That is your first priority.
[time=2521] And if you can love them in such a way as you struggle through life with them and she's making their make mistakes and you're making mistakes.
[time=2529] But yet somehow in the midst of it all, God can give the grace for the household to be well managed and the children are under control,
[time=2537] then consider some leadership in the church.
[time=2542] But if that's not the case, step out.
[time=2547] Step out.
[time=2550] What does it look like when those houses being managed that way?
[time=2554] Look at your Bible there. Verse 4, "He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control," is the word control with all dignity.
[time=2563] It's just the word submission and it means to place yourself underneath, to line yourself up underneath the authority.
[time=2571] And as we think about that in the New Testament, our mind goes to Ephesians chapter 6 where it says that children obey your parents
[time=2577] and then it says, "And honor your father and mother." And then those two words is both the external behavior of obeying the command, obeying the rules.
[time=2587] And then that other word, "honor," talks about that inner disposition of reverence. In other words, respect.
[time=2593] I do it externally and I do it internally. I obey you externally and I obey you internally.
[time=2599] And that's what's being called for here.
[time=2602] Now let's be honest with each other. No man will have total control or submission of his children at all times.
[time=2608] We live in a rebellious age. Since Satan did his thing with Adam and Eve in the garden, this whole age is best marked by the word rebellion.
[time=2616] We are a people and rebellion against God and our children are rebellious people, even as we are rebellious people.
[time=2623] So it's not that every minute of every day is absolute bliss and perfect harmony and perfect relationship and absolute control.
[time=2631] It is instead back to this overarching phrase above reproach. When you look at the whole, when you look at the characteristic pattern of the life,
[time=2639] does the man manage his household well and are his children under control?
[time=2645] A lot of times when you talk about this type of thing, people say, "Well, what happens if an elder's child would have a fling with drugs,
[time=2652] or to be involved in pregnancy outside of marriage, or to have some type of illegal behavior going on?"
[time=2659] And I would say, and this is more my opinion in the experiences that we've had at Grace Community Church and such places,
[time=2666] but I don't think any one event in the life of a child is what's in view here.
[time=2672] There may be a very difficult set of circumstances and a kid will maybe experiment with drugs or maybe end up pregnant
[time=2679] or have impregnated someone else or these kinds of things.
[time=2683] And when you get into some of that, I think the man in question needs to bring his situation to the other elders on the board
[time=2691] and say, "Guys, this is my situation. This is as I see it. Please help. Please look and help me evaluate.
[time=2697] Should I step out? Should I step out for a time? Should I step out forever? Should I change some of the things that I'm doing in the way that I'm relating?"
[time=2707] In other words, I don't think the best person to evaluate whether or not he's disqualified at that point is that guy.
[time=2713] I think he takes that to the other elders. I think the elders gain input from connected people in the family, in the church,
[time=2720] and there's a lot of options there.
[time=2724] But the clear message is that the household needs to be under control.
[time=2729] It needs to be managed well. The children need to be under control.
[time=2733] Now, I need to add one thing to that with you. If you'll go to Titus back two books, Titus chapter one.
[time=2745] Titus chapter one, you remember, has another listing of qualifications for the same office, elder.
[time=2751] Instead, this time, Paul is talking to Titus, who is in Crete. If you're looking, verse six.
[time=2759] Namely, if any man be above reproach, the husband of one wife having children who believe, having children who believe.
[time=2768] In other words, a man who would be a leader in the church, an elder in the church, his children need to believe the gospel.
[time=2775] They need to be saved. They need to have faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2783] The man whose children do not believe, discredit his ministry, we will not only follow you into a way of life,
[time=2791] but we're not going to follow you into the most important part of life, namely a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=2798] And this is tough, because they have their own mind, right? I mean, they have their own will. They're their own people.
[time=2806] And yet, somehow, the leader could be disqualified by that other person, not expressing faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2819] Having children who believe the Christian faith of their fathers and who adorn that faith with Godly conduct, that's what's being described.
[time=2827] Men who are qualified to lead the church have children who believe the Christian faith of their fathers and who adorn that faith with a godly conduct.
[time=2839] A man whose children are not saved or behave as though they are not saved must not be appointed as elder.
[time=2848] And I believe that in a way, this is almost a divine stamp of approval on those who would aspire to leadership because it is out of their control.
[time=2859] I mean, you can control your temper and be temperate, and you can organize your life and be respectable, and you don't need anybody for that.
[time=2865] You can open your house to strangers and be a lover of strangers, and you don't need anybody for that either. That's just you and you.
[time=2873] But when you talk about the effect of your leadership in your kid's life, now you're back on your knees saying, "God help."
[time=2882] I can't produce that. I can't guarantee that. And if I do try to guarantee it, and if I do strangle their little necks trying to make them look just like what they're supposed to look like, I'm probably going to see more rebellion than I know what to do with.
[time=2895] And I think it's a good thing that it's there as a requirement because it forces the men who would aspire to leadership to again be forced to acknowledge their dependence on God.
[time=2905] Men are a lot of things here that are out of your control. And it causes them to grab lightly onto their ministry to keep an open hand in their ministry.
[time=2915] God may take it away. God may take it away. Instead of grabbing a hold of them and smothering it.
[time=2924] Okay, well come on back then to First Timothy for just a minute and we'll finish this up.
[time=2930] He must be one who manages his own household well, verse 4, keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=2938] Now I want to talk about that word dignity for a minute because I think it continues to open our eyes to the leadership that men give both in the home and in the church.
[time=2947] Third dignity talks about respect and it means that if you're a person of dignity, not in the world's way of thinking of it, but in this sense, in the Biblical sense, if you're a person of dignity, you're respected by other people.
[time=2960] Other people respect you because of who you are. It's not that you demand it from them, it's just they look at you, they look at your life and they go, I respect that person.
[time=2968] So it is an intrinsic thing, it comes from within the child looking at their father and they say, I respect that man.
[time=2977] That's the kind of leadership that is given. This is not a spirit-crushing tyrant who gains submission by harsh punishment or unjust oppression.
[time=2986] He leads or manages his household in an honorable, respectable and dignified way.
[time=2992] The Bible implores fathers not to provoke or to exasperate their children over and over, you'll hear that as a theme in the Old Testament and the New Testament, don't exasperate your child.
[time=3000] And I think what that means is don't treat your child in such a way that you don't understand the bent of that child and the nature of that child and the unique personality and you just come crushing through the door with your list of demands and the way it's going to be and you exasperate the child, you push it completely out of what it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to be trained and raised.
[time=3019] It takes skill not to exasperate and yet still call the holiness.
[time=3023] It takes intimate involvement and knowledge and you oftentimes don't know what to do.
[time=3032] Had a situation like that just recently even, the last couple of weeks in our household and one of our daughters, I just felt like we weren't connecting, we weren't, my leadership wasn't being received as it had been in the past.
[time=3048] And it was a very emotional thing and there were lots of tears in her eyes and anger coming out and unusual ways, extra ways and they've been going on too long.
[time=3060] And we found ourselves up in her bedroom and she's on her bed there and I'm kind of sitting with her and I said, do you mind, can I ask you some questions?
[time=3070] How are you experiencing me?
[time=3072] How are you feeling about me right now?
[time=3075] In other words, how am I doing?
[time=3078] Now I'm not looking for her to affirm my leadership but I want some honest feedback.
[time=3082] Could you tell me what I feel like to you right now and she gave me some honest feedback and it wasn't all real good?
[time=3087] I mean she had some good points where I wasn't cutting it and I acknowledged those and asked her to forgive me for those.
[time=3097] And I said, now in light of this situation, how should we work together? Me as dad and my role, you as daughter and your role, how are we going to work our way through this situation and a hundred others that are coming just like it?
[time=3110] And we chatted together and I tried to be open in my heart and learn and listen, by the time we're done I had tears in my eyes and she had tears in her eyes and we were hugging and at least we felt both together that our relationship was back together.
[time=3125] And I'm sure we're going to butt heads again, you know, we're both sinful human beings.
[time=3131] But there's a respect I hope, I hope that there is a relationship of respect that can come from that.
[time=3138] And I share those things with you only to say that I resist the notion of people being up front here and everything's glitter, you know, everything's great, everything isn't always great.
[time=3148] And there are real struggles and trials and we walk through those together.
[time=3152] But it is not a spirit-crushing tyrant.
[time=3162] In a book that Stephen Covey wrote, allow me to read excerpt that I think is the opposite of dignity.
[time=3171] He says this, suppose for example that whenever my children begin to do something I feel as inappropriate, I sense an immediate tensing in the pit of my stomach.
[time=3180] I feel defensive walls go up, I prepare for battle.
[time=3184] My focus is not on the long-term growth and understanding, but on the short-term behavior.
[time=3190] I'm trying to win the battle, not the war.
[time=3193] I pull out my ammunition, my superior size, my position of authority, and I yell or intimidate or threaten or punish, and I win.
[time=3201] I stand there victorious in the middle of the debris of a shattered relationship while my children are outwardly submissive and inwardly rebellious,
[time=3209] suppressing feelings that will come out later in uglier ways.
[time=3214] Man, that sounds familiar.
[time=3217] He's been watching me, you know.
[time=3220] There are times when you come home and you're tired and you're frustrated and the situation has gone on too long and you just want relief.
[time=3226] And so there's that harsh, demanding, unthoughtful, unloving misuse of authority, size, and position.
[time=3238] And he calls his readers then to close their eyes and to envision themselves at a funeral.
[time=3247] And to see the funeral home and to walk inside the door and to look there at the front at the casket and it's open.
[time=3255] There's somebody in there.
[time=3257] And then as it goes on, people start coming in and he knows all these people.
[time=3261] There's his wife, there's his kids, his mom and dad, relatives, friends from the church, people from work.
[time=3271] Goes up there and looks in the casket and it's him.
[time=3276] It's his own face.
[time=3278] It's his funeral.
[time=3279] He's come to his own funeral.
[time=3281] So he sits back down and it's time now to pay respect.
[time=3288] And one of his children can get up and talk about dad.
[time=3294] He says this, "Now if I were sitting at the funeral, we visualized, and one of my children was about to speak,
[time=3301] I would want his life to represent the victory of teaching, of training and disciplining with love over a period of years
[time=3309] rather than the battle scars of quick, fixed skirmishes.
[time=3314] I would want his heart and mind to be filled with the pleasant memories of deep, meaningful times together.
[time=3320] I would want him to remember the times he came to me with his problems and concerns.
[time=3325] I would want to have listened and loved and helped.
[time=3329] I would want him to know I wasn't perfect, but that I had tried with everything I had.
[time=3335] And that perhaps more than anybody in the world, I loved him.
[time=3341] The reason I would want those things is because deep down I value my children.
[time=3346] I love them.
[time=3348] I want to help them and I value my role as their father.
[time=3353] And that's good.
[time=3357] Maybe as we prepare here to depart, you fathers would find a quiet place in your house before the day is over
[time=3365] and envision that same experience in your life. And if it were your funeral today, what would they honestly say?
[time=3375] What would your...
