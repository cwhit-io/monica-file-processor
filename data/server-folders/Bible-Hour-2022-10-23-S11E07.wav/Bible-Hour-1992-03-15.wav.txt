[time=0] Today, I want to talk with you about a subject which most people don't want to talk about
[time=6] very much at all.
[time=7] That's a subject of death.
[time=10] Death is separation, separation first from our bodies, and the spiritual death is separation
[time=16] from God.
[time=17] And the question I would ask and try to answer this morning is are you prepared to die?
[time=35] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=43] Thank you for joining us.
[time=44] Today Pastor Moore is interrupting his series from First Timothy for a special message about living and dying.
[time=51] This last week, a 17-year-old young man in our church, a student in our Christian school, died.
[time=57] For the last three years, he had been battling leukemia.
[time=60] As our church joins with his family and mourning his death, it is appropriate for us as a family to understand what God's Word has to say about death.
[time=68] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Corinthians chapter 15.
[time=74] We will be looking at verses 54 through 58.
[time=79] Our special music before today's message is by Kevin Rowe and is entitled, "I Love You, Lord." As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's begin our time of worship and meditation as Lois Clancy presents a reading she has written entitled guests, followed by reflection singing "Hurt by Hurt" and the sanctuary choir and orchestra representing "I Am Determined."
[time=103] She knocked upon my door and said that she had come to stay, and though I would not welcome
[time=109] her but bade her go away, she entered in.
[time=113] Like my own shade she followed after me, and from her stabbing, stinging sword, no moment
[time=119] was I free, until one day another knocked most gently at my door.
[time=125] I cried, "No, pain's living here, there is not room for more." But then I heard his tender voice, "Tis I, be not afraid."
[time=136] And from the time he entered in, the difference it made, for though he did not bid her leave
[time=142] my strange unwelcome guest, he taught me how to live with her.
[time=149] I had never guessed that we could dwell so sweetly here my lord and pain and I.
[time=157] In this fragile house of clay, while years slip slowly by.
[time=187] I had never guessed that we could dwell so sweetly here, that we could dwell so sweetly
[time=194] here my lord and pain and I.
[time=196] I had never guessed that we could dwell so sweetly here my lord and pain and I.
[time=560] I.
[time=561] I had never guessed that we could dwell so sweetly here my lord and pain and I.
[time=676] No physical pain that's going through our family today.
[time=680] Also as you listen to the reflection as they saying hurt by hurt sometimes our.
[time=684] Message to one another stings like a sword that goes right into the side of a person.
[time=689] We're not aware even of what we've said.
[time=692] We need to worship today and be aware that our comments toward one another need to.
[time=698] Be of a complimentary nature one that would be honoring to the lord and I.
[time=702] Hope as we worship today we not only are soothed with our physical pain by the lord but that will be soothed also in the fact that he does revive us he picks us up.
[time=713] And keeps us going when we're down and that's the greatness of our lord and.
[time=717] That's the privilege we have to of serving here together as a body of believers and helping one another when we're down.
[time=723] That's the lord to revive us today and fill each heart with his love as we sing him number two hundred ninety five.
[time=730] We'll sing verses one two and four together.
[time=753] We'll sing verses one two hundred ninety five.
[time=836] Hello and welcome again to the Bible Hour. We're glad that you've tuned in today.
[time=840] If you're watching in our local television station on March twenty second you'll realize that this is groundbreaking Sunday for us.
[time=847] Russell we've had a number of months of planning the educational unit with the gymnasium and we're going to break ground on March twenty second exciting day for Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=857] Well it really is it's a tremendous day for us to take a step forward.
[time=861] You know Pete we tried to build this building about two years ago we ran a program or a campaign to do that and the timing wasn't right and the elders responded to that.
[time=871] Just the money didn't come in and it just didn't seem right and they backed up and now it's moving ahead full steam and it seems to be the timing of the Lord to have brought us to this very day to break ground.
[time=880] It really is thrilling to have a congregation that listens carefully and weighs the issues and then votes intelligently and I think that's what happened last Sunday night as our congregation overwhelmingly voted for this construction and we're grateful for that.
[time=894] As we talk about the building this gives us expansion for our Christian school.
[time=899] Blackhawk Christian school is now accepting registrations if you'd like to know more information about that you can call the school office.
[time=907] The area code is two one nine and the number is four nine three seven four oh oh.
[time=913] Once again that's four nine three seven four oh oh and ask for the school office and they can explain to you how you can register for the classes that are still open.
[time=923] We have some other events that are taking place that we'd like to involve you in.
[time=927] On Friday April 17th we're going to have a good Friday service at the Grand Wayne Center from 1215 to 1245.
[time=936] We're calling it Embrace the Cross it'll be a short service but it'll be a time to reflect on the death of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=943] I hope that you can come especially if you work in the downtown area bring a friend for that half hour service on Friday April 17th.
[time=952] And then we have a great drama program entitled Spark in Judea it'll be given on Saturday evening April 18th here at the church at 7 p.m.
[time=961] And then on Sunday evening at 6 p.m.
[time=964] A great program has been planned with great drama great set and you will experience again the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ in an unusual way on Saturday evening April 18th or Sunday evening April 19th.
[time=980] I hope that you'll come again you can call the church if you have additional questions.
[time=985] We've also talked Russell about helps for people and I think one of the things that I like about the Bible hours from month to month we have some kind of a periodical that we're able to give the people.
[time=996] We'd like to tell you about a book that's called God's Promises for Your Every Need.
[time=1001] And you can receive that booklet today by writing to the Bible hour at 7400 East state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1012] Once again write for the book God's Promises for Your Every Need, write to the Bible hour 7400 East state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1025] Russell we just came off a powerful package of music talking about hurts in our lives how God is the center of that healing process.
[time=1034] And I appreciate especially the phrase in the choir number that says I am determined to be invincible until God has finished his purpose in me.
[time=1044] And sometimes that comes at an older age he finishes and occasionally it comes at a younger age and that's the case in our church family right now.
[time=1052] That's right one of the dear young people in our church Greg Hindle that we've been praying for as a church for nearly three years has gone to be with the Lord and he was 17 years old taken by leukemia.
[time=1065] And just this same week we have really remembered the anniversary of the death of a little girl in our church Amy Moore who died when she was about 10 just a year ago.
[time=1078] And it just seems evident that the Lord is calling our church family to think about death and to not gloss over it as I think our society so typically does.
[time=1088] And so this morning we're going to talk a little bit about death and living in light of death.
[time=1093] It's not an easy time for families but I'm sure that this is a very timely message.
[time=1098] And I hope that you'll remain for some more music and then the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore on this subject of death and living.
[time=1106] Stay tuned to the Bible Hour today for this timely message.
[time=1114] It's the best of both worlds. And again we believe the Lord is.
[time=1135] We seek your face as we gather in this place in one accord yet it seems I'm all alone.
[time=1151] As I come to you in the quiet of my soul you touch me and my worship is complete for your presence here is sweet.
[time=1171] I love you Lord. I love you Lord. I love you Lord with all my heart.
[time=1187] The song rings out around the earth. I love you Lord with all my heart. Lord I love you.
[time=1209] Your hands lifted high. I hear voices all around. Your children offer praises to their King.
[time=1225] We must cry out with a song of Jubilee to carry on the message that we bring until every voice can sing.
[time=1244] Oh I love you Lord. I love you Lord. I love you Lord with all my heart.
[time=1260] The song rings out around the earth. I love you Lord with all my heart.
[time=1278] We stand before you with free sounding praise. We shout and add unto your holy name.
[time=1293] I love you Lord. I love you Lord. I love you Lord with all my heart.
[time=1307] The song rings out around the earth. I love you Lord with all my heart.
[time=1326] I love you Lord. I love you Lord. I love you Lord with all my heart.
[time=1342] The song rings out around the earth. I love you Lord with all my heart.
[time=1363] With all my heart. With all my heart. With all my heart.
[time=1389] Thank you Kevin for sharing not only that song with us but for living the truth of that song as we know you.
[time=1395] I really love the Lord. Well I found myself late in this week realizing that what I had prepared to share with you this Sunday would not be appropriate.
[time=1408] I was going to continue on in our study of first Timothy but the events that have transpired in this life of this church in the last few days just have captured my heart and my mind and I felt no freedom to go ahead with that.
[time=1423] Many of you were here when Greg Hindle was diagnosed with leukemia and you have been walking with the Hindle family for some three years and praying for them.
[time=1435] I guess I showed up a year ago when Greg was undergoing his bone marrow transplant and in that year's time my life has been deeply affected by Greg and some of the best memories I have of so far of Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=1453] wrap and involve around the life of Greg Hindle as I would drive to in the Annapolis to visit him and travel back and forth on that highway with Audrey and visit them in the home as at brief times he would be back up here in Fort Wayne
[time=1468] and just the conversations that Greg and I would share and enjoy together. And this will not be a memorial service by any way shape or form but I didn't feel free to go off and talk about something else
[time=1480] and instead I want to spend a little bit of time this morning thinking about death, thinking about life, thinking about living in light of the reality of death.
[time=1489] The Lord in his sovereignty has brought two of our youngsters to death in premature ways. Of course I'm thinking of Greg Hindle and Amy Moore who I never had the privilege of meeting.
[time=1504] But when the Lord does that in a church and of course Amy's anniversary was remembered last week by our family. And the Lord brings that kind of stuff together in such close proximity in the life of a church.
[time=1517] It may be that he wants us to focus just a little bit about the brevity of life and the reality of death and to ponder some of those thoughts.
[time=1532] As I think about death and I think about our culture and I think about America I am struck by the reality that they I mean our culture is doing everything to insulate us from the reality of death.
[time=1546] Thinking this week as I did about death again I remember all kinds of different field trips as a kid growing up in the public school systems and I remember going to the dairy to find out where we got our milk
[time=1561] but I can never remember going to a slaughterhouse to find out where I got my meat, where my hamburger meat came from and where my steak came from.
[time=1570] Field trips seem to go everywhere but the slaughterhouse. We went to the zoo, we went to the fire station, we went to the planetarium, we went to the beach.
[time=1578] And it just strikes me strange even now that nobody ever, no teacher in any planned way whether in the curriculum of my coursework going up through high school in the actual class coursework or in any field trip ever brought our class or the minds of our kids face to face with a reality of death, even the death of an animal.
[time=1600] And some people might call it civilized and I would rather call it an estitized. I believe that that is by design. I believe that the people who are organizing the curriculum want nothing to do with death.
[time=1613] They don't want to think about it, they're not prepared for it and as a result they don't want it in their curriculum and they don't want to have any part of it in their school systems.
[time=1621] And that even by way of animals, I mean I think if we were forced to watch the slaughtering of a cow and then the process from that moment until it delivered to our plate for a piece of steak, there wouldn't be a lot of us really ready to eat.
[time=1637] I mean if that were all just one continuous movement and it was cooked in front of our very eyes, we're so removed from it, we're so distant from it.
[time=1644] And death in humans is even more remote from our day and our age. Death happens in most cases in hospitals and it's handled by professionals and the moment the death has occurred, though there may be a brief time for the family to somehow experience that moment of death that is then whisked away and they leave the room and professionals move in and everything is handled.
[time=1667] The day when Grandpa and Grandpa would die right there in the home and that corpse would lay in that house for an extended period of time and then oftentimes the family themselves would move that body out into a cemetery or a backyard or a back lot and the grave would be dug and that would be dealt with.
[time=1688] But see all that is not a part of our lives for the most part. I was 27 years old before I saw or was in the same room with a corpse.
[time=1697] I don't know what your experience was like but for me it was all the way after college and seminary and all the rest before I was ever even in the room with somebody who was dead.
[time=1707] And I can remember all my life being terrified of that because I've been so insulated from it. It wasn't natural, it wasn't normal but it is normal, it is natural, it's a part of living.
[time=1718] It was my grandmother who I first saw die and I was there with my mom and her dad but we again in that typical scenario stayed only a brief time and then left and I never saw her body again, not once.
[time=1734] About five years later my grandfather died and I was about an hour's distance from his home and my sister was living there and she gave me a phone call and along with alerting other family members and I immediately drove to that home saying to myself they're not going to rob me from being a part of the death process.
[time=1753] And I went into that house and went into the den that I'd spent so many hours with him, we called him Kid. I was named after him Russell B. Seymour was his name and that familiar surroundings and he was laying there on the floor between the table and the couch and he'd fallen over there and was lying there and interestingly my daughter Randy desperately felt the need to come with me and so she was there in the room and we just sat there for a couple of hours before the people came to take him away.
[time=1782] And we touched his body and we talked about death and we kept thinking that his body was moving you know because your mind kind of does that if you've ever been around a dead person you'll think they move their arm or they open their eyes and it's just your mind kind of filling in the blanks and
[time=1796] I was amazed as my mom finally showed up she had a little longer drive and she came in and embraced him and talked about how much she loved that body and all the memories that she had with it and it seemed so healthy it seemed so right to me.
[time=1813] Her sister who is not saved never came in the room had no way to understand that no way to deal with that would stop at the door and would keep a level of composure but would never really come in and enter into what had happened.
[time=1830] Just so removed so distant. We live in a culture that wants to separate the death experience that wants to hide it from us and minimize it and trivialize it and I believe that is of Satan.
[time=1843] I don't believe that civilized I don't believe there's anything normal about that and you say why do you say that why do you think that the fact that our culture just tends to be polite about death or removes us from death why do you say that that's of Satan.
[time=1859] Well first of all I say it because of all the explanations that the world gives for death if they can't hide it and they can't minimize it and they can't get away from it then they try to explain its consequences away with something like soul sleep you know in which the body dies and then disintegrates
[time=1876] while the spirit or the soul rests or they offer the materialist's view believing in utter extinction total annihilation nothing human physical or otherwise survives after death death ends at all as if the lights go out and everything that was no longer is
[time=1894] reincarnation where the soul or the spirit is continually being recycled from one form to another moving its way up the ladder to some place of bliss from human to animal or from animal to human depending upon the performance of the individual.
[time=1912] Others describe the occurrence after death and the term absorption in which the spirit or at least a certain part of the spirit returns back to its source and is absorbed back into the ultimate divine mind or being and they liken it to the comparison as if we're a drop of water and on death we're thrown back into the ocean and we're just absorbed back into what we were and somehow that makes sense to them and everything's okay.
[time=1938] They have absolutely no way to face what really happens if you're not saved at death and you know what makes me feel like our culture's movement away from facing death and really the only time they let us see death is in some type of a serial murder
[time=1954] or mass murder situation and there they're not focusing so much on the death but the oddity of the depraved man that did the doings and it's just a sensational thing all they want are better ratings.
[time=1965] It's really not a grieving or a dealing with death it's just an exploitation of sin but the reason I think it's of Satan is because I compare it with the words of our Lord.
[time=1979] Do you know that Jesus said more about death and about hell than he ever said about heaven?
[time=1987] Jesus was constantly warning the people that they were going to die and that when they died they were going to go to hell.
[time=1998] I'm going to take a minute this morning because I want you to hear it I'm going to run just through the book of Matthew there are 15 maybe passages that I'm going to share with you.
[time=2006] I don't know if you'll be able to keep up with me I'll give you the references you may want to write it down.
[time=2011] I have all these underlined and read in my Bible I was just so amazed to learn the emphasis that the Lord placed in his ministry on warning people that they are going to die and after death they are going to go to hell.
[time=2026] And he describes it in so many different ways Matthew chapter 5.
[time=2033] This of course is the Sermon on the Mount and he's clarifying true righteousness Matthew 5 22.
[time=2040] He says I say to everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court and whoever shall say to his brother Rocca shall be guilty before the Supreme Court and whoever shall say you fool shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.
[time=2054] Jesus taught judgment Jesus taught death and then judgment and then punishment verse 29 at the end of that verse then then for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[time=2066] In other words if your right eye makes you stumble tear it out and throw it from you for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body perish than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[time=2090] We come from there to chapter 7 verse 19 he's talking about the narrow gate and the broad way that leads to destruction and many are those who enter by it.
[time=2102] Then down down at verse 19 every tree that does not bear fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[time=2110] It's a clear picture of hell it's a picture of those who would stand up as prophets of God but bear no fruit bear no true lasting spiritual fruit their imposters and their end is hell and he warned them and he warned the people that were following them.
[time=2127] And then up in verse 23 remember this situation they're crying out Lord Lord they're making bold acclimation to faith but it's only head knowledge and they have these kind of religious deeds that are listed in verse 22.
[time=2142] Did we not prophesy do we cast out demons and perform many miracles and then verse 23 then I will declare to them I never knew you depart from me you who practice lawlessness and this is really the second death that's spoken of in Revelation.
[time=2158] The first death death the better word for death might be separation and when we die we are separated from our body that's the first death and when we die again the second death we are separated from the presence of God.
[time=2171] And that's what he's talking about here depart from me I never knew you you who practice lawlessness get out of my presence go away from me what does that say that's another way of saying go to hell.
[time=2184] When God says get away from me when God says depart from me he is sending people into a Christless eternity separated from God and therein is the reality of hell.
[time=2197] Come over to chapter 8 verse 12 but the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into the outer darkness in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[time=2213] Weeping and gnashing of teeth constant unrelenting torment. Chapter 10 verse 28 and this of course is the commissioning of his disciples to go and share the gospel.
[time=2233] And he says to them in verse 28 and do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
[time=2247] Jesus spoke often of death and often of hell. Chapter 13 verse 42.
[time=2267] Let's start in verse 41. The son of man will send forth his angels and they will gather out of his kingdom all stumbling blocks and those who commit.
[time=2276] There it is again lawlessness people who practice lawlessness verse 42 and will cast them into the furnace of fire.
[time=2284] In that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Verse 50 and will cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
[time=2298] That is just the constant state of affairs for people who die physically without having accepted Jesus Christ as their personal learning Savior.
[time=2308] And the Lord loved these people and wanted them to be aware of that. Come to Matthew 18 8.
[time=2323] In verse 7, woe to the world because of its stumbling blocks, for it is inevitable that stumbling blocks come but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes.
[time=2335] And here again, if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you.
[time=2340] It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than having two hands or two feet to be cast in to the eternal fire.
[time=2349] And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it from you for it is better for you to enter life with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into the fiery hell.
[time=2359] Now don't be misunderstanding this. Jesus isn't saying that you can make atonement for your sin by ripping off some body part that is a culprit in your practice of sin.
[time=2368] He's saying that your sin is leading you to such a devastating end. It will be so bad for you in the end that it would be better for you to rip off your body part and live the rest of your life without the use of that limb or without the use of that eye for this brief time in life
[time=2387] than to have to enter an eternal place of burning and fire and torment and the gnashing of teeth.
[time=2395] So he's not saying you can make atonement for your sin. He's saying that hell is so bad, so unrelenting that you would be the wiser if you could to do away with even your body parts to avoid going there.
[time=2412] Matthew 22 verse 13.
[time=2425] Then the king said to the servants, "Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. Into that place there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[time=2440] So here it is the fiery furnace and yet it's utter darkness. How those two things come together, there's much about hell that we don't understand.
[time=2452] Chapter 23 verse 15.
[time=2458] "Here he holds these scribes and Pharisees accountable for preaching a false gospel. Woe to you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte. And when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves." In other words, when he follows your leadership and he buys in to your way, your false religious system.
[time=2481] You make him into twice as much a son of hell as you yourself.
[time=2487] Boy, that says something to people who think they're going to be saved in the end because they've been religious. It's not being religious that saves you. It's being right with God in a personal relationship with Christ that makes all the difference.
[time=2499] These people were very religious. These scribes and these Pharisees were more religious in that sense of the word than the best of us would be.
[time=2507] More faithful to their ritual and more faithful to their time in the Old Testament.
[time=2514] But it was a false religious system and their converts were bound for hell.
[time=2520] Matthew 23 verse 33.
[time=2524] Here he speaks directly to the scribes and the Pharisees calling them serpents, a brood of vipers. How shall you escape the sentence of hell?
[time=2535] You know, he's saying to them, "You know well enough about hell. There was enough of it spoken to you in the Old Testament. You've read the witness and the testimony.
[time=2542] You know about, though they didn't know as much as the New Testament reveals, they had an understanding of Sheol and the pit and death and darkness and torment.
[time=2551] And he's saying, "How are you ever going to escape that?"
[time=2557] Chapter 25 verse 30.
[time=2572] "Cast out the worthless slave into the outer darkness, in that place there shall be weeping and gnashing in teeth of teeth."
[time=2579] Come back up to verse 28 for a minute. "Therefore take away the talent from him and give it to the one who has ten talents, for to everyone who has shall more be given, and he shall have an abundance, but from the one who does not have, even what he does have shall be taken away."
[time=2598] "Cast him out, throw him away, discard him." Jesus used the word Gehenna in the Greek for the word hell.
[time=2608] And Gehenna was a place just outside the city of Jerusalem that was like a dump. It would be like a contemporary dump for us, and this is where people brought their trash to burn it.
[time=2618] And there were times when he would walk by that and make allusion to hell. It was an absolute place of utter waste.
[time=2624] You did not want what you would not use, what you would not have. You brought to Gehenna and you burnt it.
[time=2631] And that is his picture for us of hell.
[time=2637] Verse 46. This is the last thing that he says about hell in this book.
[time=2644] And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
[time=2653] This is the great divide. This is the great divide of all humanity.
[time=2660] Some are going to be given over to eternal punishment, and others are going to be given to eternal life, and they are called the righteous.
[time=2667] Now they are not the righteous in and of themselves, obviously. This is a righteousness that is given to them by the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2674] It is a righteousness that is earned by Christ and given without charge to the undeserving, to the wicked, to the lawless, to those who deserve to die.
[time=2687] Now to complete the picture this morning, just come with me to 1 Corinthians, if you would, chapter 15.
[time=2694] And this is a couple of verses that have been made famous over and over through the centuries.
[time=2698] Handles Messiah has it beautifully articulated, speaking about victory for the one who dies in Christ.
[time=2708] The one who has accepted Christ and how death for him really is a gateway into eternal bliss.
[time=2715] The phrase that Handel captured is in 1 Corinthians 15, 55.
[time=2722] It is Odeth, where is your victory? Odeth, where is your sting?
[time=2731] I remember my first encounter of this verse came through Handel's Messiah.
[time=2735] I was at USC and I had come to Christ only months before, and I was trying to find a place to study, so I went to the big Dohini Library
[time=2744] and ascended up the stairs in that very stately place of intellectual achievement, which I was quite out of place in.
[time=2751] And I went to the listening room, and I just saw this music, and I'd heard of Handel's Messiah, of course, and heard parts of it before,
[time=2760] but I'd never heard this particular song about Odeth, where is your victory?
[time=2764] And I put these headphones on and I was trying to study, and it just began to move in my heart and captured my mind,
[time=2771] and I began to weep just right there in the library as I began to understand the reality of the fact that death has no victory in my life,
[time=2779] and it has no sting because of what Christ has done.
[time=2783] Verse 54, "But when this perishable will have put on imperishable, and this mortal will have put on immortality,
[time=2792] then will come about the saying that his written death is swallowed up in victory."
[time=2798] Now, this is a wonderful thought. Death is swallowed up in victory. He's quoting Isaiah, chapter 25, verse 8.
[time=2805] And it's not just that because of Christ, the death process is stopped.
[time=2809] It's that all of death is swallowed up. All of the consequences of death are swallowed up in the victory of Christ in his resurrection.
[time=2818] It might be compared to a tornado, and the tornado is ravaging its way through the countryside and tearing up homes and streets and cities,
[time=2826] and it's not just that the tornado is stopped.
[time=2829] The victory that Christ has swallows the whole thing up. In other words, it goes back and it restores all the damage that has been done.
[time=2836] For the person who is in Christ and finally comes to the point of physical death, though at that very moment it is swallowed up.
[time=2844] All of what they are, all of what they hope to be, all of what they have been is utterly engulfed and swallowed up in the victory that Christ gives them through his death and resurrection.
[time=2854] This is total reversal. This isn't amending or affixing.
[time=2859] Oh, death, verse 55, where is your victory? Oh, death, where is your sting?
[time=2866] And the metaphor continues here, there is no devastation. And whether the sting be that of a bite by some snake or whether it be that of a bee or whatever the prophet might have had this time, Hosea, in Hosea 13, whatever he might have had in his mind,
[time=2881] it is nevertheless that something has penetrated, but there's no sting, there's no consequence.
[time=2886] It's happened to me, but nothing else happened to me. It somehow is consequentialist.
[time=2893] Why? Verse 56, "Because the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
[time=2901] What he's saying there is that the damaging, the irrevocable damage that occurs at death is due to the sin that brought the death on, and when the sinner dies in his sin, then death is utterly devastating.
[time=2915] It is irreversible, and the consequences are eternal. Because of the element of sin, the sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
[time=2927] But over and over and over again, we are reminded that there is no sin for us once we are in Christ.
[time=2934] 1 John 1 says, "The blood of Jesus, his Son cleanses us from all sin, and so when we die there is no sting."
[time=2942] There may be physical pain, there may be physical discomfort, but even as the Lord said, "Don't fear those who can destroy the body, only fear those who destroy body and soul."
[time=2951] In other words, the enormity of death in sin is the eternality of the whole thing that there is no recovering, that it's constant eternal torment.
[time=2958] All that's gone, all that's taken away because as a believer you don't die in your sin. You die in the righteousness of Christ.
[time=2966] 1 John 2 sins are forgiven for his name's sake.
[time=2971] So because of Christ, everything is different. Everything is radically different after death.
[time=2979] After death for the unbeliever, it is absolute devastation and destruction.
[time=2984] After physical death for the believer, it is a gateway into absolute unadulterated paradise.
[time=2991] It stands as the great divide, but the chapter goes on, and it says not only is it different after death, it should be different now.
[time=2999] Verse 57, "But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ," and now verse 58, "Therefore, because that's true, because it's victory for we who believe, therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast and immovable."
[time=3018] Instead fast is a Greek word that describes being seated and therefore not going anywhere, settled down.
[time=3025] And this immovable notion is even stronger, the Greek word there is just absolute motionlessness.
[time=3033] I'm steadfast. I'm immovable. Death is coming. Death is on its way. Death will soon knock on my door, but I am seated.
[time=3045] I am motionless. I am immovable.
[time=3048] And in what sense? Nothing will deter me from doing what it says in verse 58, "Abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain."
[time=3060] And so in the same verse, there is a picture of absolute motionlessness with respect to being deviated from the course of obedience to Christ.
[time=3068] I will not move. I will not budge. You cannot shake my confidence. I am settled. I am motionless.
[time=3074] And yet in the same verse, I am abounding with activity. I am giving my life away in sacrificial service.
[time=3081] Abounding means excessive energy, excessive involvement, beyond what would be normal.
[time=3086] I'm just throwing my life at the cause of Christ in the work of the Lord because I know that in death, I am the victor.
[time=3098] Henry Martin, the British missionary to India and to Persia, determined to, quote, "burn out for God," which he did.
[time=3106] He died before he was 35 years old.
[time=3110] David Brainard, one of the earliest missionaries to American Indians, died before he was 30.
[time=3118] We know very little of what the Bible says about a pathoditis. Remember him?
[time=3122] Brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier of Paul, Philippians 2, 25, and 30 say he came close to death for the work of Christ risking his life.
[time=3134] Death no longer is the thing which is avoided or pushed into the background or can't be dealt with because of Christ and the victory for us in Christ.
[time=3142] We can face death. We are immovable. It's as if we're sitting on a train track and the train is coming and it's in clear vision and we're sitting straight in the middle of the way and we just sit there because we're not afraid of death.
[time=3157] In the interim, we work diligently giving our lives away for the cause of Christ.
[time=3165] There are people who live like that today. You don't have to go all the way back to Henry Martin or David Brainard or a pathoditis. You can find them. They're around.
[time=3174] They know the brevity of life. They know the temporalness of this world and they are literally burning them.
[time=3180] They're not advocating working yourself to exhaustion every minute of every day, but it's the idea of because we know that life is brief and that we have victory in death, we will stand immovable.
[time=3194] We are steadfast, but in that we are abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that the toil is not in vain.
[time=3201] And I'm so thankful for that. Sometimes I feel like my toil is really in vain.
[time=3206] If you feel that way, you get caught in the routine of your life. You don't see its significance. You wonder what it's all adding up to and somehow in his plan, he's making sense of it all.
[time=3218] So living in light of eternity, death is the great divider for the unsaved death is the gateway to anguish for the saved. It is the gateway to paradise.
[time=3227] For the unsaved death is not only something they await. It is the domain of death in which they live.
[time=3233] Ephesians chapter 2 says they're locked in the sphere of sin, of trespass. They can't get out. It's just the domain of death in this God forsaken world.
[time=3244] But for us even this very day is opportunity to abound in the work of the Lord. Death is coming. Someone has written it this way.
[time=3255] There is a preacher of the old school, but he speaks as boldly as ever. He is not popular though the world is his parish and he travels every part of the globe and speaks in every language.
[time=3267] He visits the poor, calls upon the rich, preaches to people of every religion and of no religion. And the subject of his sermon is always the same.
[time=3278] He is an eloquent preacher after stirring feelings which no other preacher could and bringing tears to eyes that never weep. His arguments none are able to refute nor is there any heart that has remained unmoved by the force of his appeals.
[time=3294] He shatters life with his message. Most people hate him. Everyone fears him. His name? Death. Every tombstone is his pulpit. Every newspaper prints his text and someday every one of you will be his servant.
[time=3314] That says it well doesn't it? And if you're here this morning without Christ you can be certain that if Christ were here he would talk to you about hell.
[time=3326] You can be certain that he would want to impress upon your heart and your mind the severity of what awaits you if you die without accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3338] But there is another way. The hope of the Christian is expressed by the epitaph of Benjamin Franklin who wrote for himself and then had it engraved on his tombstone in the cemetery of Christ Church in Philadelphia. It reads this way.
[time=3355] The body of Ben Franklin printer like the cover of an old book its contents torn out and stripped of its lettering and gilding lies here food for worms. But the work will not be lost for it will appear once more in a new and more elegant edition revised and corrected by the author.
[time=3375] That's our hope. That's our hope. We're coming back. Greg Hindle is coming back from the dead.
[time=3387] He is right now in the presence of the Lord and I try my best to envision him there. I don't know what he's doing but I know he's happy and I'm thrilled for him.
[time=3396] But I know somewhere around here there's his corpse, his body. And we're going to have opportunity to view it in the days to come that information is published.
[time=3411] We've been sharing with you today music from our sanctuary choir and orchestra reflection and soloist Kevin Rowe. The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3422] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3432] Dear Heavenly Father, I come in a privilege to come before you today and to talk to you and to tell you that I've sinned against you and I need a Savior.
