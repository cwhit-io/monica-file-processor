[time=0] today we come to the subject of being a servant and in our day and age the
[time=6] servant is really a degrading term it's almost the picture of a human mule that goes about life performing unimportant tasks and is rarely noticed but Jesus elevated the term of servant and equated it with greatness in fact he said that he himself had come not to be served but to serve and it give his life a ransom for many you'll never be more like Jesus Christ than when you're serving and when you're giving your life away welcome to the Bible hour an hour of Bible study music and fellowship which
[time=48] we hope you'll find to be an encouragement thank you for joining us today pastor Moore will continue his series from first Timothy where we have been studying the characteristics of church leadership in the last few weeks we have addressed the characteristics of evangelistic crane the role of women and the characteristics of elders today pastor Russ will be addressing the fourth and final piece of this puzzle namely the role of the servant in the church though it is the last piece it is by no means the least significant consider what Christ has to say in Mark 10 verse 43 but whoever who desires to
[time=86] be great among you shall be your servant we suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to first Timothy chapter 3 where we will be studying verses 8 through 13 our special music today includes an encouraging number

[time=116] worship and meditation as rejoice sings the song he loved me
[time=140] God chose us to be his very own before the creation of the world he decided
[time=147] then to make us holy in his eyes without a single flaw we who stand before him
[time=153] covered with his love his unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into
[time=159] his own family by sending Jesus Christ to die for us and he did this because he
[time=166] loves us
[time=196] he loved me when I was every thing he was me redemptions were was no Jesus
[time=226] she has separate me from the love of God shall please come tomorrow hey so I saw a row can let me be the ruler of the world.
[time=256] In the session the threat of war and the pressure in all these things. The tree is all reward. The tree is all reward. The tree is all reward.
[time=282] You Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=292] I am sure that neither death nor light nor angels nor principalities nor power nor
[time=309] things present nor things to go nor hide nor death nor any future shall separate me from the love of God.
[time=336] Of this I am sure that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor power nor things present nor things to go nor hide.
[time=362] I am sure that neither death nor any future shall separate me from the love of God.
[time=378] You Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=408] The Bible says that he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was upon him
[time=437] and by his wounds we are healed whatever you've gone through I know of mothers that have died of a broken heart I know of fathers that have died of a broken heart I know children that are not well because they have a broken heart
[time=458] they just can't take it and they give up well I don't really understand this but I know that every broken heart Jesus Christ bore that on the course he carried every pain that I've ever suffered and that I will ever suffer
[time=476] the heartache that you've had he bore you and will bear for you no one is a friend like Jesus
[time=506] make them think you're happy
[time=512] Lie and say the things are fine and hide that empty longing that you feel don't ever show it just keep your heart cool
[time=535] and see now are the days so lonely
[time=547] I wonder where can the heart go free
[time=557] and who will draw the tears that no one sees there must be someone to share your silent dreams
[time=575] like a beautiful wind looking for a friend where can you turn whisper the words of a brain and you'll find him there
[time=589] can't open wide love in his eyes
[time=597] Jesus, he needs to beg God
[time=603] oh Jesus, he needs to sing the songs
[time=612] follow them, your holy voice Jesus the bread of a wounded heart

[time=1014] and then his death and his glorious resurrection and also speaking of death we've had a couple deaths recently in our church that have really gotten to our hearts well they've spanned really the spectrum of age of course Greg Hendel at 17 years of age diagnosed with leukemia
[time=1034] about three years ago and for those three years I guess both he and his parents were anticipating the inevitability of death or the very real possibility of that he'd even planned his funeral service in advance which was a wonderful time a celebration and then another another lady really a part of our church Elizabeth Dick has passed away and that was as sudden and as unexpected as you
[time=1058] could imagine it kind of reminds us as I've talked with other people that are in the hospital or whatever that God doesn't always give us a length of time to get our house in order
[time=1069] that it's very important for us to know our spiritual condition and be prepared before that day of reckoning and in the case of Mrs. Dick that was sudden and she really never regained consciousness and I'm reminded that the death of Jesus Christ was also planned in fact you were reading subscriptions just before we went on the air yeah it says here in Acts 2 verse 23 this man meaning Jesus delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God you nailed to a cross by the hands of Godless men and put him to death but delivered up by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God there certainly is a hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and I think what we want to stress today is really no man knows the hour or even the day when Christ may take him home what does shame it be if you didn't know Jesus Christ
[time=1121] is your personal savior scripture has a lot to say about that in our gift offer this month it's called God's promises for every need there are some categories that speak of the death and resurrection of Christ and we'd like to have you have this booklet you can receive it absolutely free if you write to the Bible hour today at 7400 East state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815

[time=1185] John 14 says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my Father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you if you loved me you would rejoice because I said I go into the Father for my Father is greater than I yet a little while and the world seeeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live also here we are again

[time=1454] thank you Denise
[time=1470] beautiful voice beautiful song beautiful truth well if you have your Bibles this morning I'll invite you to take them and to turn to the book of 1 Timothy we're studying through the book of 1 Timothy together and we come this morning to the end of a very important section in 1 Timothy chapter 3 we'll study the role of the deacon in the church and as you remember Paul chapter 3 verse 15 is writing so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself and the household of God through the ministry of Paul at different points in his life he has given different amounts of information about how to organize and structure the church in one of his first letters the book of 1 Corinthians and all through that church there were problems all through that book there were problems with the church itself but you remember in chapter 12 of 1 Corinthians he talked about spiritual gifts and really unveiled for us a level of understanding about the church and being a part of the body of Christ he later in his ministry wrote the book of Ephesians which is even more information for us about the organization and the elements and the purpose and the spiritual dynamics of the New Testament church but as he aged and was near his death he wrote the pastoral epistles 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus and in these books gave us an enormous amount further to build on what he had previously given of how to structure and order the church and we're in a section about structuring and ordering the church the section began in chapter 2 verse 1 and I'll just review this with you briefly so you can see the mind of the Apostle Paul at work he began in chapter 2 verse 1 by saying first of all then I urge that in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men he begins by calling the church back to its original purpose which is the great commission and what he's calling for here is more than just prayer he's calling that in the hearts of the people there would be a deep burden for the salvation of the people of the world so deep a burden that every time they meet they are praying for the salvation of lost souls he moves on then in verse 9 to a new section a new part of organizing the church in verses 9 to 15 he signals it by the word likewise I want women to adorn themselves and then he goes on to give instruction as to their adornment and as to their ministry and while women are to be wonderfully used of God in the church and they are a vital role in all we do here as Blackhawk Baptist Church and all that was going on in the church at Ephesus or should have been going on with them they are not to teach they are not to exercise authority over men they are not to expound the word of God in the public assembly and so he limits them in that way but he affirms in distinction or contrary distinction to the cultural flavor of the day that they are to be disciples they are to be learners they are to be taught they are to be instructed and as we move through this book we'll find other places of ministry positively stated that women will have but having given the teaching responsibility and the exercising authority through the teaching ministry to the men he then moves in chapter three verse one through seven to describe the qualifications of those men who will be doing that teaching who will be overseeing the church they are called overseers or elders or pastors and those are just three different terms for the same men some of them are professionally employed by the church they receive their income and their way of living from the church itself others of them are overseers or pastors or shepherds and they do not receive their income from the church they instead make it in the community tent making if you will even as you saw in the life of Paul but whether or not they are employed by the church if they are an overseer they are to be above reproach there are to be no handles that you can take a hold of in their life where there is substantial violation of the word of God thereby disqualifying them from leadership and we saw that those handles are primarily found in the arena of relationships the first a husband of one wife the second that he manages his own household that his children love honor respect and obey him and would vote for him for this position of eldership and then in the community that even the unsaved even the people who don't know Christ even the people who maybe never read the Bible they too play a part in qualifying the leadership of the church because often they know more about this potential or prospective elder than even we who are in the church for they live in the day to day and the pressures and the stress of the real live world and it's their reputation that these unbelievers can speak to and then last but certainly not least comes this ministry of the deacon and that's picked up in verses 8 through 13 and when you talk about deacons you talk about service deocanos there really is no English word for the word deacon we've just coined it from the word deocanos in the Greek and so we come up with the idea of deacon in the verb form it's diaca neo and it means to serve and so as we begin a discussion of deacons we begin the discussion of being a servant and really as you know in our day there is little respect for the servant that is not a title of honor that is not a title of prestige or prominence in the community in fact the word servant sometimes pictures at least in the secular world a human mule type of a person or an individual who sort of plows through life unnoticed and doing the unimportant tasks that however is not God's concept of the servant and that certainly isn't the way Jesus used it he used the term servant and elevated it by equating it with true greatness remember he said whoever wishes to become great among you shall become your servant and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all mark 10 43 and 14 44 as a result it was Moses one of the greatest leaders that ever lived who was called Moses my servant and the man who followed him Joshua who led the most successful military campaign in the history of Israel was also called a servant Joshua the servant of Moses and then of course Jesus himself delighted in referring to himself as a servant he said the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many you can boil the whole life of Jesus Christ down to two things he came to do just simply two things he came to serve and he came to give his life away and you and I will know no greater level of Christ's likeness than when we are serving one another and when we are sacrificially giving our life away and it was needed in the first century church it was needed in this church at Ephesus that a group of people would gather together and be noticed and recognized as deacons as official servants of the church who would carry on the ministry of the church as it relates to the ongoing day-to-day interaction in people's lives I would suggest to you that one of the greatest strengths of this church are the deacons of our church as they administrate and lead and shepherd and care and serve in our ABS one of the greatest joys that I have is to stand up on Sunday mornings and to invite our first time visitors to our ABS because I know what goes on there I know the level of heartfelt servant that our deacons provide and I would group in that arena of servants the teachers and the ministry team leaders that are there as well and any of the rest of you who may not have a particular title but you know what you do you know you're there to serve you know you're there to give and when somebody is sick the meals come and when somebody's in financial trouble the money is raised and you serve the missionaries on the field by all the various projects that you do you are the strength of our church you are the relational fabric of what we are that is probably the best part of our church and I will say again if you're a part of our church but you only come to the worship service you're missing the best part you're missing the very best part where you could find your way in to a group of other Christians 40 or 50 in number and you'll find there a love and a care and a concern and a support that you can't find anywhere else in the world that would be the serving and the giving of the people in our ABS and that is spearheaded by our deacons let me read these six verses and we're going to move rather rapidly through them this morning we'll begin in verse 8 deacons likewise must be men of dignity not double tongue or addicted to much wine or fond of sort of gain but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience and let these also first be tested then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach verse 11 women must likewise be dignified and not malicious gossips but temperant faithful in all things let deacons be husbands of only one wife and good managers of their children and their own households for those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves high standing and a great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus now we'll look at these verses this morning and there will be some overlap with the qualifications for elder and where that's the case I'll just touch and then go on it begins in verse 8 deacons likewise must be men of dignity and this is a strong word in the Greek the notion of dignity involves two things one a strong sense of purpose and as a result respectful conduct they are therefore people of dignity men who have a strong sense that their service that their ministry behind the scenes that their ministry though it not happen on the platform it happens on the telephone as they're caring for people it happens as they're setting up and taking down certain chairs to provide for the sunny school group it happens in a myriad of ways that few people see but they understand that that contribution of service contributing to the greater purpose of this church and they're tied to that and so therefore they do it and as a result they're respected they're held in high honor and rightfully so so they are men of dignity opposites of this idea of dignity would be frivolous or superficial or shallow or silly instead they are full of determination commitment and stability and that's why we look to them that's why we trust them that's why we nominate and elect them to that position of service he goes on then to say that they are they are full of dignity and they are not double-tongued they are not double-tongued a deacon will say one thing in this particular setting to these people and then he'll say the exact same thing to another group that may not feel as favorably about his report he isn't a hypocrite he doesn't adjust his speech to accommodate the company he keeps if it's true he says it if it happens that how it was and so he stands by his word but this word double-tongued and you may have a different translation of this particular word in your version of the Bible but this Greek word is used in the Old Testament in the Septuagint the Greek version of the Old Testament it gives an interesting flavor to it allow me to read you this verse Proverbs 11-13 says this he who goes about as a tailbearer reveals secrets there is a feeling in this word or a nuance to this word of one who can keep confidential matters confidential you know there are very few people who can keep a secret have you noticed that there are very very few people who can keep a secret why well because when you know something about somebody else that everybody else doesn't know that information is power you can you can present yourself as being a very powerful informed in the know type person as you reveal that you can be the one who sees the excitement and the adrenaline rush and the other person's mind and even in their eyes as they hear some little bit of something that they shouldn't have otherwise known a servant doesn't do that a servant isn't taking your confidential information then using it for his own ends a servant treasures your material the thing that you may have shared in confidence with them about a financial struggle or a spiritual struggle or a real problem in the home between the husband and the wife or something that's going on at the place of employment a deacon you can share that with him and you can have absolute confidence that it stops right there he's not double-tongued it goes on it says there in verse 8 that he is not addicted to much wine and here's one that we've already talked about under but again the thrust he's not under the control of some alien influence in order to make it through his day to make it through his life to make it to the next day he doesn't have to come home and fire down a couple of drinks to deaden his experience of reality instead there is dependence upon the spirit of God to strengthen and to carry through the very sometimes difficult situations in life and so whether it's addicted to wine or addicted to money or addicted to some other to being a fighter or pugnacious as we saw with the elder there is a freedom from those kinds of addictions and instead there is a dependency upon the Lord and so the servant is dependable and the servant is faithful now the last qualification found in verse 8 is an interesting one it says fond of sordid gain a deacon is not fond of sordid gain now again the Bible never says that you can't be rich the Bible never speaks disparagingly of having wealth it always speaks disparagingly of people who love their wealth people who are lovers of money people who have earned their money through illegitimate ways and that's what's in view here he is not fond of sordid gain money or wealth that has been earned through illegitimate ways whether those be illegal investments whether that be through fraudulently reporting incomes so that the taxes are not as high in whatever way this man comes into contact with his money he earns it and he dispenses it in a way that he is free from gaining money ill legitimately he rightly sees the money that God has given him as a stewardship and is to be employed in places that honor and exalt the living Lord Jesus Christ now this is an obvious qualification for a deacon because deacons are often in the process of handling the church's money just the other night I was here on a Saturday night and I walked by the chapel over on the north side and there was a great ABF having a fantastic time they were having so much fun I heard them out in the hallway they were having an auction they were raffling things off and you know they had a bitter system going on inside there and people were saying this and upping that and upping this and upping that and so I poked my head in there to see what all the fun was about and I found out that they were raising money for their missionary and so what they would do is people would donate a particular thing like a gift certificate the Scots and it was worth a certain amount of money and then people would just bid that thing up until it was well over its original value and all that stuff gets to go to the missionary deacons are leading that deacons have handling on that money if a person in our church is struggling and they're a part of an ABF and we know about it and we can help them financially after we've investigated the situation it's the deacons recommendation that certain amounts of money come from the church to minister to that spiritual need or that financial need so this is an obvious qualification because deacons are often with the people and they're with the people in financial ways now verse nine kind of wraps it all together but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience and the emphasis here is upon the man's conscience the man keeps a short account with God the way he lives his life not just according to the objective truth of the word of God but as that word of God is applied to his heart and mind the way it works out in his place of employment and with his wife and with his children he is constantly obeying the conscience that God has given him and the prompting of the spirit of God he's also one that is not found then in pretense a lot of times when you're brought into a position of leadership like a deacon or an elder then there are all these expectations that people have of you that you do certain things at certain times and in certain ways and if you're just doing that because it's expected if you're just doing that because if you don't then people won't think as highly of you as you want them to think it becomes very hypocritical and you don't have a clear conscience so this really drives to the heart of the motive of the man he does these things he is a man of dignity he's not double-tongued he's not addicted to much wine he's not fond of sordid gain he does his ministry of service in the church because it comes from his heart and his soul out of a deep love for God and a deep love for Christ and a deep love for the people that he serves so as a result he has a clear conscience now like the elder he must be tested like the elder he must be approved verse 10 and let these also first be tested then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach and the testing here is a positive testing it's not a negative suspicious kind of a wary eye as you see someone serving in the church and you look upon them with real suspicion kind of waiting for them to mess up that's not what's in view this is a real positive testing this is a testing with the anticipation of success with the hope that they will pass the test and find their way into service as I was studying it this week I was drawn back to an incident about two or three years ago my second eldest daughter Nikki came running in the house with all kinds of excitement and joy and just grabbed me and demanded that I come out into the driveway and onto the street and all excited and you got to come see and what am I going to see and she's no no I can't tell you just come so we got out on the street in the cul-de-sac there and my next eldest daughter my third daughter Kelly is standing there holding this little bike then Kelly had never ridden a bike before you know without training wheels and so Nicky says okay and so Kelly jumps up and Nicky is holding the handlebar in the seat and she says I don't forget you got a pedal you got a pedal and so push and then she pedaled you know Kelly got going and there's a little wobbling and then she forgot the pedal and so Nicky is right there running next to her and I'll go got a pedal you got a pedal okay now turn and there's Nicky coaching her through this entire thing why well because Nicky had just taught her for the first time out of rider bike and she was testing her she was showing her off to mom and dad but it wasn't a test that was looking for failure it was a test or an approval process that was full of support and full of encouragement and full of commitment saying you can do it you can do it you can make it that's the notion that's the kind of testing in view here and so as you in leadership are working in your ABFs and you're training up the next generation of leaders that's the attitude you get involved in their life and you see the raw potential and you're excited about what's there resist the temptation to be negative and to be pointing out the flaws as opposed to bringing that positive approval process of testing into their life though at points correction would indeed be needed okay now to verse 11 and it goes to an interesting transition this verse has been the subject of some controversy it talks about women or wives and here again we have the Greek word that could be translated either way it could be a woman in general or it could be translated a wife women must likewise be dignified not malicious gossips but temperate faithful in all things now there are three at least three possible interpretations of this verse who are these women well one interpretation is that they are the wives of the deacons in other words the deacons are being described in verse eight verse nine verse ten and now we'll have a word about their wives the deacons wives they must likewise be dignified not malicious gossips etc etc another view is that it's not the deacons wives it's just women in general just the women of the church the women of the church should be dignified not malicious gossips temperate and faithful in all things and then there's a third view and this is probably the view that I favor and for reasons that I'll share with you here in a minute it's this that these women are not the wives of deacons these women are not just the general women of the church these are women who hold the office called deaconess the office of deaconess now I'm aware of the fact that our church works basically with the understanding that these are deacons wives and that's great and I'm overwhelmingly grateful for the ministry of our deacons and their wives but as we move through this I want to give you some food for thought about the interpretation of this passage let me give you four reasons why I think this is an office called deaconess and then you can mull it over in your own mind first of all the word likewise do you see it in verse 11 women must likewise be and then this list well come with me now to chapter 2 verse 9 remember now you're in a section of two chapters in length in which Paul is building and setting in place the structure of the church and when he begins with this notion of evangelistic prayer when he's finished with that he makes a transition to another subject and he begins that with this word likewise so it becomes a literary key to us we're moving from one topic to another verse 9 likewise I want women and then he goes on to describe that for them then come back to chapter 3 and look at verse 8 he's going to transition again into another subject matter and he says deacons likewise must be men of dignity not double tongue etc etc and so the argument goes like this he's using likewise as a transitionary word to move from one subject matter to the next and when he uses it in verse 11 the translation would be women or deaconesses must likewise even as the male deacons must be this the women deacons must be this secondly there is no possessive pronoun now some of your translations read and their wives and the possessive pronoun there is the word there it's not in the Greek text it's been put there by translators that happens in the king james as well so there is no personal pronoun and therefore one of the compelling reasons when you read it in the English to think that these are the wives of deacons isn't there at all in the Greek and Paul's been known to be pretty careful with his words and he didn't use it there so that's reason number two reason number three is the context is all about church leadership not mates in other words we're dealing with the leadership of the church in elders and deacons and then it seems somewhat unnatural suddenly to talk about a mate in the middle of all that and here's my fourth reason if in fact it is the wives of deacons which it could be I mean there are good men on that point right there if it is then my question is this why doesn't it talk about elders wives in other words if deacons wives have qualifications why don't elders wives have qualifications and of course there are none there listed or anywhere in the Bible to qualify the wives of elders so for those four reasons the absence or the use of the word likewise as a literary key to transition from one subject to the next not exclusively he doesn't always use it but when he does he he uses it to move from one subject to the next secondly the absence of the possessive pronoun the word there it's not in the Greek it's been added thirdly the context here is church leaders not the mates of church leaders and fourth the unbalanced approach then between qualifying deacons wives and failing the quality qualify elders wives that's food for thought now notice the qualifications that are listed in verse 11 for these women or these wives there is a striking parallel between their qualifications and that of the deacon above the deacon must be men of dignity verse 8 verse 11 the women must be dignified same thought same word then it says the deacons must not be doubled tongue the women must not be malicious gossips same thought then it says that the deacons must not be addicted to much wine and it says of the of the women they must be temperate you remember when we looked at that with respect to elders the word temperate means balanced they're not out of control they're under control of their life and it has an order and it has a balance so there'd be a parallel there between not being addicted to much wine and being balanced and temperate and then lastly in verse 11 faithful in all things these women or wives are faithful in their responsibilities and their duties and that would correspond to verse 9 and the deacon he is holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience so these women and may their tribe increase whether they be the wives of deacons or whether they be a separate office called deaconess are serving the church in all dignity they are not spreaders of rumors they are not full of malicious gossip you can trust them with your hurts you can trust them with your struggles they are balanced in their approach and they are incredibly faithful now then he resumes discussion of the deacons which might be a good argument against my view because why would you split this up but verse 12 let deacons be husbands of only one wife and good managers of their children and their own household and here again the Apostle Paul is warning us not to qualify a man based upon his success in his place of employment the criteria must come back to his wife and to his children and if he is faithful with them if he is a godly man with them if he loves them in service and faithfulness then there is the qualification for his ministry inside the church now verse 13 and this is the reward this is the reward for those who serve so faithfully for those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus they have a two-fold reward the first is that they have obtained for themselves a high standing there is a growing respect for these men and women in their ministry the people of the church recognize them for who they are and they are held in high esteem secondly they have a great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus you know there are a lot of people that struggle with the assurance of their salvation there are a lot of people who though they have prayed a prayer and been in the church for years have a real sense of question still boy am I really saved and there are a lot of people who will go in and out of that in their life and what Paul is saying is that one of the rewards that comes to these deacons even as they are on the earth is that they will have an overwhelming confidence in the faith that they are truly saved the faith that they have in Jesus Christ there will be a sense of assurance they have found their niche in the body of Christ their servants you know what there is an ease to their service that feels right it feels natural it is fruitful people respond to it and as a result they have a real strong sense and inner assurance that they are born again and that they are saved so when all is said about you and about me better than them saying that there was some level of giftedness or some fruitfulness of ministry that they were especially blessed of God or that they were remarkably well known or popular far better than anything of that nature it would be that we were found to be faithful servants that we gave ourself and that's the great thing about service I mean you don't have to be it doesn't depend upon your gift in some upfront showy way service is a ministry that all of us can and should have led in this case by the deacons but anyone and everyone can serve so deacons deacons play a vital role in the life of the church they are to be men of dignity not double tongue not addicted to much wine or fond of sort of gain they hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience and they have been approved by the family in a very positive and affirming way their wives or a separate group of women called deaconesses are also dignified they are not malicious gossips they are temperant they are faithful in all things these deacons are one women men they love their wives they are devoted to their wife they are not playing the harlot in their heart they are faithful managers of their children their children love and honor and obey them and then these great temporal children at this point in time rewards they win the favor of the people as they are recognized as self-sacrificing servants and they have inside their own hearts the great and marvelous confidence that they are indeed saved you know I believe there will be far greater reward at the beam of seat for the washing of feet than for the preaching to thousands and there are numbers of you and there are myths whose names we don't know whose service has gone unnoticed because it doesn't happen in some of the obvious ways but God has watched and been delighted in every deed church that is marked by servants is a godly church it is a loving church there may be some of you men in our assembly and women who would be challenged by this who would say my life is void of service I can't think of really anybody that I'm serving except myself I perform some duties now and then because that's kind of a give and take if I don't do my part then they don't do their part but as far as just free will service boy I'm not really serving anybody I'd encourage you to find give yourself to it find a place to serve
