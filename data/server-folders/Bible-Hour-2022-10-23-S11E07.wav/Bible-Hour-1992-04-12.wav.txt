[time=0] We're considering this morning how God chooses leaders.
[time=4] We're finding from the Word of God that he chooses his leaders based upon their character, not necessarily their level of giftedness.
[time=12] Joseph is a perfect example of a man with enormous character, and because of that, God has used him in a magnificent way in the building of the nation of Israel.
[time=23] Joseph was three things, teachable, faithful, and available.
[time=43] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=50] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] Today, Pastor Moore will continue his study of the characteristics of church leadership.
[time=57] Last week, we studied the life of Samson, a gifted man who consistently failed to demonstrate the qualities of Christian leadership.
[time=64] Today, Pastor Moore will be leading us in a study of Joseph, another Old Testament character.
[time=71] As we have said throughout this series, God is much more interested in the quality of a man's character than he is in a man's abilities.
[time=79] Joseph exhibited many character qualities.
[time=81] Do those same qualities exist in your life?
[time=84] Are you teachable?
[time=85] Are you faithful?
[time=87] Are you available?
[time=89] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the Old Testament book of Genesis.
[time=94] We will be looking at portions of chapters 37 to 50.
[time=99] Our special music today includes a medley of hymns by our sanctuary choir entitled, "God's Almighty Sign." And then, just before Pastor Russ comes to speak, Tim Newton will be playing that great old hymn, "It Is Well with My Soul." As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's join the handbell choir as they proclaim, "Thou Art Worthy."

[time=395] [MUSIC - 278 seconds]
[time=678] Hello, and thank you for watching the Bible Hour today. This is a very exciting week for the Christian Russell. This is perhaps the most momentous week in the whole history of Christendom.
[time=689] Well, the resurrection is the basis of it all.
[time=693] We are certainly glad that we have an opportunity not only on one or two Sundays to talk about Christ and the resurrection power, but we do it regularly here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=706] And even on the Bible Hour, as we proclaim that Christ indeed rose from the grave and is our salvation. What a great theme that is.
[time=715] If you're watching the Bible Hour today and this area on April 19th, you still have an opportunity to come for our final drama presentation.
[time=725] It's entitled Spark in Judea and will be Sunday evening, April 19th at 6 p.m. I hope that you can come and join with us.
[time=733] We did it last night, exciting time. We had a number of people here and you'll enjoy this presentation. It's just one that's very exciting.
[time=741] And also last week we talked about the groundbreaking. We had a beautiful day for groundbreaking and things are beginning to happen on the east side of our worship center.
[time=750] Things are moving ahead rapidly. They brought the heavy earth moving equipment and they've began to prepare the site.
[time=757] It's exciting. The Lord said that He'd build His church and the gates of hell wouldn't prevail against it.
[time=762] And of course He meant it in a spiritual sense, but there is the physical necessity of buildings in our day and age and it's wonderful to see the thing begin to go up.
[time=770] I was just amazed how quickly they rearranged the earth filled in some lower areas and just straightened that out.
[time=778] And it won't be long and we'll be seeing walls going up and that is very exciting.
[time=784] You've been watching the Bible Hour last week. We had a gift offer. It's a ribbon for your Bible or for a book that you might read.
[time=791] We'd like to give this to you absolutely free. And we'd like to encourage you to write to us today and ask for the ribbon.
[time=797] Not only that, but to just tell us that you're watching the Bible Hour and praying for us.
[time=803] You can receive this ribbon by writing to the Bible Hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=813] Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=823] One of the exciting things is the fact that we look through the mail each weekend as I want to remind you that every Wednesday morning we have a group that gets together to pray for prayer requests that come into the Bible Hour.
[time=835] And we are thinking of you and praying for you and I hope that you'll write from time to time and let us know.
[time=842] Last week I looked at a new book called God's Gift for Mothers, a really beautiful book.
[time=847] And we're coming into the season when we're going to be celebrating Mother's Day.
[time=851] But this might just be an opportune time here in the spring to think about your mother and remember her with this beautiful book.

[time=895] God's Gift for Mothers is 100% scripture versus organized by topic so your mom can easily find the answers she's looking for.
[time=903] Like how to build a life of prayer, how to have the joy of the Lord, and how to overcome stress.
[time=910] Plus there's a special crisis guide filled with God's promises of encouragement and hope for those really tough times.
[time=917] God's Gift for Mothers is attractively packaged in its own gift box, making it the perfect gift for your mom.

[time=960] We go back now to the live portion of our service as we listen to more music and then the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=976] [MUSIC - 220 seconds]
[time=1206] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1217] Some of you don't know Tim yet because he and his wife are relatively new to our church.
[time=1221] They've been coming for about nine months I think and Tim teaches music at IPFW and Huntington and Grace and we're thankful for your addition to our number and for your being willing to share your gifts with us.
[time=1235] Beautiful rendition as well with my soul.
[time=1240] Well let's take our Bibles this morning and open them to the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=1247] We are studying leadership. We are studying leadership in the church in particular not just leadership in the business community or leadership in civic or political arenas.
[time=1257] We are talking about the highest leadership in the land that being the leadership that God gives to the church.
[time=1266] And over the past several weeks months I guess we have been examining about 14 verses out of chapter three that list the qualifications for leadership both as an overseer or an elder and as a deacon.
[time=1280] And we have examined them in some minutiae with great care but we've been backing up the last couple of weeks to get a picture of the landscape and seeing a principle that runs all the way through scripture and that is this.
[time=1297] God qualifies men not based upon what they can do not their giftedness but upon their character not on what they can do but who they are as individuals and we looked last week from the Old Testament at a negative example, a man by the name of Samson, a man who was given
[time=1314] unbelievable potential unlimited potential for the kingdom of God but he did not guard that potential with godly character.
[time=1321] And when he came to the end of his life he found that he had contributed very little to the kingdom of God in comparison to what he might have otherwise done.
[time=1329] It was said of Samson that the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed in his life and epitaph really of tragic failure.
[time=1339] He had been raised up by God to deliver the nation of Israel from the oppression of the Philistines and what have done that in his life in his living but he so crumbled in his character that it was one last fleeting moment almost bordering on suicide
[time=1354] in which he took down the temple in which the lords of the Philistines were worshiping and actually mocking him and therefore praising their gods, their false gods that he actually did his greatest good for the kingdom of God.
[time=1366] It's a tragic story of a tragic man who threw away unlimited potential for impact in the kingdom of God.
[time=1374] This morning I want us to see a different type of example also from the Old Testament but this man is a positive example of how one can be used in the kingdom of God and really he is nowhere lifted up for his giftedness whether natural or spiritual.
[time=1390] There is nothing said about him in a spectacular nature as there was with the life of Samson and to return back to a familiar Old Testament character come with me to Genesis chapter 37 and will remember for a minute or two this morning the life of Joseph.
[time=1407] Joseph of all the Old Testament characters may be the one who single handedly contributed to the kingdom of God more than any other.
[time=1418] He stands peerless in contributing to what God was doing in history in the Old Testament. He was given just really mind boggling contributions to the kingdom program to advancing the knowledge which leads to faith to the raising up of the nation of Israel so that through Israel all the other nations could receive the knowledge of the true and living God.
[time=1442] But he has introduced to us in Genesis chapter 37 verse 2. These are the records of the generations of Jacob. Joseph was 17 years of age was pastoring the flock with his brothers while he was still a youth along with the sons of Bilhah the sons of Zilpa his father's wives and Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.
[time=1465] That's it. Now he is mentioned in earlier chapters but really only by way of genealogy. There is no fanfare in his introduction to us. There are no great predictions made about his life. His birth was not announced by angels as was Samson's. He took no Nazarite vow.
[time=1482] There was no declaration of his cause as a great judge of Israel to liberate the people from their oppressor the Philistines. Just in this verse his age is listed, his occupation. He was looking after the flocks and the fact that his brothers were messing up and so he brought a bad report to his father.
[time=1499] And yet Joseph was a man who focused on character. Joseph was a man of unbelievable character before God and because of that as I have noted his contribution is without comparison.
[time=1512] And I believe the same can be true in your life and I believe the same can be true in my life. I believe that as you and I focus on walking before God as people of integrity as people who are promoting godly relationships as people who are seeking holiness in our lives.
[time=1530] God will use us to do everything he has purpose to do in our lives. Now it may not be as spectacular and on such a grand scale as Joseph's but you and I can go to our grays and instead of the epitaph that we did more for God in our death than we did in our life we can be assured
[time=1547] just by focusing on our character that we will accomplish the work which God has given to us in this lifetime and that's reassuring. That means we don't have to be super gifted, we don't have to be super talented, we don't have to have some of those natural and spiritual
[time=1562] endowments. Our job, our focus even as it is lifted up for us in 1 Timothy 3 is to focus in on who we are not what we can do. Now let's see that.
[time=1574] I want to cover the 13 chapters of Joseph's life in about 25 minutes and to do that I want to highlight three terms or three words that exemplify men of character.
[time=1585] Men of character are teachable, men of character are faithful and men of character are available, teachable, faithful and available and you'll see that in his life and the consequences that flowed out of it. First of all he's teachable.
[time=1603] Verse three. Now Israel, that's his father, that's Jacob, he had two names, Jacob and Israel. Now Israel loved Joseph more than all of his sons because he was the son of his old age and he made him a very colored tunic.
[time=1619] Now what you may not immediately recognize in that little phrase now Israel loved Joseph more than all of his sons is a family character trait flaw that is being passed down from generation to generation and maybe you've identified what you've been given in your family tree. I know I have.
[time=1638] But there is a tendency in the family tree and from generation to generation a certain character flaw will poison the family tree and it just seems to run down through the generations and that's exactly what you're seeing here in verse three.
[time=1651] Israel loved Joseph more than all of his sons, it's the poison of favoritism and therefore special privilege. If I were to take you back and you don't need to turn in the interest of time but to Genesis chapter 25 verse 28 you would read the sentence that Isaac loved Esau but Rebecca loved Jacob.
[time=1675] Isaac and Rebecca are Joseph's grandparents, two generations back and in that narrative there is distinct favoritism and a vying for special privilege in the family because the father loved the first born and the mother loved the second born
[time=1693] born and they put the boys at odds with each other and you remember that Jacob stole the birthright from Esau and eventually deceived his own father by loving to him, excuse me that'll go away in a minute, by lying to him when he was old and age he couldn't see you remember and so he came close to Isaac and Isaac put his hands on Jacob and he'd put
[time=1716] hair on his hands and on his neck so he'd feel like his older brother Esau who was a hairy man and Jacob wasn't very hairy and he said it is me, I am the eldest, I am Esau, give me the patriarchal blessing.
[time=1731] So it starts with the grandparents, Jacob is discipled in favoritism and special privilege by his mother Rebecca and if I were to take you to Genesis chapter 29 verse 30 you'd find this sentence, Jacob loved Rachel more than he loved Leah.
[time=1750] In other words, now Jacob, Joseph's father, loves one of his wives more than the other and gave her special privilege. Jacob actually had four wives and all, the first one he really wanted was Rachel, you remember he went over to Uncle Laban's place and saw this beautiful woman, the Bible says was beautiful in form and appearance and fell immediately in love and agreed to work for seven years to have the right to marry her.
[time=1775] And all Uncle Laban, he must have had the same family poison in his jeans because he tricked Jacob out of that. They came to the end of seven years, had the big wedding feast and apparently Jacob went back to his tent so drunk he didn't know who he was sleeping with when he woke up in the morning it wasn't Rachel at all, it was Leah.
[time=1792] So he had to work another seven years for Rachel and there was always a constant tension in that family between his love first for Rachel and the fact that he got stuck with Leah.
[time=1804] So you see favoritism and special privilege, favoritism and special privilege and now we come to verse three of our chapter, chapter 37 and we see the same poison being poured down Joseph's throat.
[time=1816] Now Israel loved Joseph more than all of his sons because he was the son of his old age, what's that mean?
[time=1822] The last two sons he had came from the one he really loved, Rachel. Jacob and Benjamin came from Rachel and so he loved Joseph the most and treated him as if he were the eldest of all the eleven brothers.
[time=1836] Then you see that, verse three, he made him a very colored tunic and that wasn't just a nice birthday present, that wasn't just, you know, you've been a good kid, your other brothers are kind of bad, you're bringing in these bad reports about him and I'm just going to give you a nice jacket for your birthday.
[time=1850] This very colored tunic is a symbol of nobility, it is a symbol of leisure, it was a long flowing garment that would have gone all the way to his ankles and all the way to his wrists and you don't do a lot of work in these kinds of inart innately ornamented garments that were very expensive.
[time=1868] It's a statement to everybody in his family, all of his brothers that this one Joseph is the one I love and even though he doesn't deserve eldest privileges, he's going to get them, he's going to get the double birthright.
[time=1881] And so he just begins to pour the poison right into Joseph's soul. Look at verse four, his brothers saw that, their father loved him more than all of his brothers and so they hated him and they couldn't speak to him on friendly terms.
[time=1894] His family is being torn apart by favoritism and apparently Joseph falls into it. Look at verse five, Joseph had a dream.
[time=1902] And when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. What was the dream?
[time=1907] Verse seven, "We were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheep rose up and also stood erect and behold your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to me."
[time=1917] Joseph's getting into this. Now we don't know where this dream came from. We know later he receives dreams from God and the ability to interpret dreams from God.
[time=1924] We don't know where this dream came from but it's pretty obvious that he would have been wise not to share it with anybody because all of his brothers already hated him for the favoritism shown to him by his father as symbolized in this many colored tuning.
[time=1939] His brothers in verse eight had a great response. Are you actually going to reign over us? Who do you think you are? Look at the end of verse eight, so they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words.
[time=1952] Verse nine, "Now he had still another dream and related it to his brothers and said he tells him about the stars and the moon and the sun and the moon and the stars and how they're all going to bow down."
[time=1965] So now he's saying, "Not only will you my eleven brothers bow down but mom's going to bow down and dad's going to bow down and you're all going to worship me."
[time=1973] Verse 11, "And his brothers were jealous of him but his father kept the saying in mind. It would have been nice if the father would have done something about the jealousy and the favoritism instead of just keeping the saying in mind."
[time=1986] Typically weak, passive father.
[time=1991] So Joseph didn't get his character from his family. Some of us have. Some of us have had the privilege of coming through good, strong, godly families and from the earliest age the character has been shaped and molded for the cause of Christ. Most of us haven't.
[time=2009] In either case, you're not born with character. You build character. You work with blood, sweat and tears for your character. Nobody can give it to you. You must walk through the trials and vicissitudes of life and earn and build your character.
[time=2023] You build it by taking the hard road instead of the easy road. You build your character by living according to principle, not the passion and the lusts in your heart.
[time=2031] And Joseph was now given the ultimate opportunity to do that. He was sold into slavery in Egypt.
[time=2039] And really, this is the grace of God. This is the grace of God bringing great tragedy into his life so that he can teach Joseph character away from the family poison that remained up in Canaan.
[time=2052] Now come with me, if you will, to Genesis 39. You remember the brothers were going to kill him. They threw him in a pit, along come the caravan.
[time=2060] That's on its way down to Egypt. They figure, well, we'll just make some money on the guy so they sell their brother.
[time=2065] And by the way, if you were to read Genesis 42, 21 when his brothers were finally confessing to the fault, they describe Joseph's distress of his soul.
[time=2075] You don't read it in the account in early Genesis here in 37 and 39, but when they later confessed to it, Joseph was pleading with his brothers.
[time=2083] And the distress of his soul was obvious to them. He was 17 years old. He was afraid. He was being rejected and sold to men to go to a faraway land.
[time=2093] It was traumatic in his life. Look at verse 1, chapter 39. Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt.
[time=2101] And Potiphar an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, brought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.
[time=2107] No mention of time. We don't know how long it's been since chapter 37 when his brothers actually sold him.
[time=2113] The other thing that isn't mentioned except in Genesis 42 is the distress and trauma that came into his life, but just think about it with me.
[time=2121] He's ripped out of a protected Israeli home where he's doted on by his aging father and promised the birthright.
[time=2128] He goes through the trauma of being thrown into a pit and plotted against by his own brothers first to be killed and then finally sold to these men in this caravan down to Egypt.
[time=2138] He finds himself in a strange land with a strange and new language he does not understand. With a culture he's never seen before, a home life and responsibilities which are totally foreign to him.
[time=2150] Way of dress, way of thinking. This nation of Egypt is a very bigoted biased culture and it's very hostile to the foreigner.
[time=2160] So in effect, God takes Joseph from his place of privilege where his identity is symbolized in his garment which they ripped off of him and then tore and put blood on to deceive his father with.
[time=2172] So he doesn't have that anymore and he has no context. He is sent down to a people who do not know who he is. They don't know anything about Abraham.
[time=2180] They don't know anything about the Abrahamic covenant. They don't know anything about the patriarchs. They don't know anything about his favorite position before Jacob.
[time=2187] And frankly, they don't care. It'll give a rip. He is nobody to them. He is a nothing. He is a slave.
[time=2198] And God strips out of his life all the favoritism and all the privilege and puts him at the bottom of society as a slave in a land he knows nothing about.
[time=2209] God is opening up character class 101. And Joseph is in the front row. Sit up and take notice, young man. We're now going to build into you the character that you need to be useful in the kingdom of God which you never would have gotten had you stayed in the home with your parents.
[time=2229] Joseph apparently responded to this. Why did we say that? Well, God really blessed his life. Look at verse two.
[time=2237] The Lord was with Joseph. He became successful. He was in the house of his master of the Egyptian. Now watch the master trust this man.
[time=2245] Now as master saw the Lord was with him and how the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
[time=2250] Verse four, Joseph found favor in his sight. He became his personal servant. He made him overseer over his entire house.
[time=2257] And all that he owned he put in his charge. Then it says it again, verse five. It came about that from that time on he made him overseer of his entire house over all that he owned.
[time=2266] Verse six, he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge. And with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate.
[time=2275] Now what's that tell you? That tells you that this master, this pot of fur, who by the way was a high ranking military official in the army there and was over the executions.
[time=2285] He was the chief executioner. He had found in Joseph a man he could trust.
[time=2292] A man of character who was in addition being blessed somehow. Everything he touched turned to gold.
[time=2297] But first and foremost he could trust this man and so he put him over all the duties, all the responsibilities of his house.
[time=2305] It's amazing.
[time=2308] To meet a stranger. To buy him as a slave. To watch him learn your language. To watch him learn your culture.
[time=2316] And to build the kind of relationship with him that in a number of years you are now turning over every responsibility in the household to his charge.
[time=2325] Your bank account, your business affairs, your entire estate, the whole thing is now entrusted to this young man.
[time=2333] Speaks loud of his character. Speaks loud that he could be trusted.
[time=2341] I want to just ask you a question. Have you identified the character flaws that come down to you in the family tree and I don't mean to blame anybody here.
[time=2352] But have you identified the flaws that get passed down? My dad and I have had some interesting talks about this.
[time=2360] As I start to see in me a lot of him or he sees in me a lot of him.
[time=2365] One of his flaws and again we talked about it privately and we feel free to share it publicly at times but he's just incredibly impatient.
[time=2374] I can remember just as a kid all different kinds of vivid events where we were trying to work in the garden or trying to work with family and getting people out of the house on time or sitting in traffic or just thousands of little pictures come to my mind of the
[time=2388] just enormity of my dad's impatience.
[time=2391] And now I just seem to be living them all out all over again in my own life.
[time=2396] I am impatient and as a result I get rather reckless because I want to get it done and I want to get it done now.
[time=2403] You know what? Everything should have been done like yesterday.
[time=2406] I told you we got this new house. We're so excited about it. It's just down the street here a couple minutes away but it needed a lot of refurbishing it.
[time=2412] We've been working on fixing it up and doing a lot of that work ourselves and really enjoyed that process almost all of the process.
[time=2419] About three weeks ago I was ripping this wall out and part of this ceiling and though I didn't really feel it at the time I noticed something but not of an alarming.
[time=2427] Some got in my eyes you know some dust or some particles but just wanting to get this thing done like yesterday I don't use the wisdom to go splash your eye out and let it recover and wash itself out.
[time=2440] I just take my hand and just rub it and get it out of there because I got a lot to do.
[time=2446] You see also I just work real hard all the rest of that evening until about 10, 11 o'clock at night and I wake up in the morning and I can barely open my eye.
[time=2456] Just enormous pain. Well guess what I am by about two o'clock that day. The doctor's office.
[time=2463] The doctor takes a look at my eye and he says well you've scratched the surface of your eye. So here's some medicine and here's a patch.
[time=2470] He says by the way did you have safety goggles on while you were working?
[time=2474] I said no and in my mind I'm thinking man that takes a lot of time you know you gotta find those things you gotta put them on.
[time=2480] They fog up on you you gotta clean them off.
[time=2483] Well safety goggles what is that slow me down.
[time=2489] Well so 24 hours the problem's resolved. It's just heals and your eye heals very fast so I get that patch off.
[time=2494] This is about three weeks ago. I'm all excited. I'm praising God I have my eyesight back you know I've got peripheral vision again.
[time=2500] I have depth prevention I can drive my own car. I'm happy again alright.
[time=2504] Guess what happened this week. You guessed it. There I was on Monday.
[time=2510] My day off there you know later in the afternoon and I'm cutting this two by four with my skill son.
[time=2515] I got a wedge it in so it's a 45 degree angle so it just fits perfectly we're framing up this bathtub thing.
[time=2520] And I got my lines drawn and I want to make sure that I cut it exactly online because I don't have to cut this thing twice.
[time=2525] That'd take a lot of time. So I lean over the edge of my skill saw and I watch my blade rip right on that line so I have an exact cut.
[time=2532] I get it by halfway through the board and some foreign object flies into my left eye.
[time=2538] It's the truth. Just smash. And this time it didn't wait to hurt like till later on that night or the next morning.
[time=2545] I mean I am in pain instantly and in my mind I'm thinking not again.
[time=2550] So I go to the bathroom and I throw water and I'm thinking ah it's gonna be better and it's not better.
[time=2555] Within an hour and a half I'm sitting in front of the same nurse and the same doctor and they're saying oh look it's the same eye.
[time=2567] And then they said and so tell me how did it make it through the safety goggles?
[time=2577] I said safety goggles? I didn't have any safety goggles on right then.
[time=2584] And you just feel like you're this tall. You know little Russell why didn't you learn when you were a boy that you're impatient in your recklessness.
[time=2594] You're just out of control. Back it up.
[time=2599] I told this to a friend of mine this week and I came back to the office the next day and there was a brand new pair of safety goggles in my box.
[time=2607] And I am happy to report that when I was working on the house yesterday I had to use my skillsaw again and I actually did.
[time=2613] I put my safety goggles on. And while I was doing it I was thinking oh Lord please.
[time=2618] Teachable. Make me teachable. Make me teachable. I share that with you because I really believe that God brings stuff into your life to continue to refine your character.
[time=2631] And I don't know what your character flaws are as they come down through your family tree and as you've added to them in your own sinfulness and foolishness like I have.
[time=2638] But I want to challenge you to take a look at the stress points in your life and look at where God is bringing hardship there and say okay Lord what is the lesson.
[time=2647] What are you teaching me and let me learn please. The first time not the second or the third.
[time=2654] You know I think about Job if you would open the book of Job in the first chapter you're going to find that he is described as a righteous man.
[time=2660] He is described as a godly man. He is described as a leader. He is wealthy. He is blessed.
[time=2667] But God was not done teaching him lessons and so by the next chapters in two and three God has taken away his health and his family and his wealth and everything.
[time=2676] And you follow through all those little arguments that he had with all of his friends and with God and you come finally to the end of the book and you see this.
[time=2683] He repents. Job says I repent. I thought I used to know you. I had heard about you by the hearing of the ear but now I see you with my eyes.
[time=2693] In other words even a man of a stature and the character of Job later in life a grown man full family blessed beyond his wildest dreams.
[time=2703] But Job was a man of character and God brought calamity into his life and though Job rebelled for a little while he eventually submitted to the trauma of whatever those circumstances were and he learned again.
[time=2715] I think of the Apostle Paul and I think of him over and over and over again God even gave him a thorn in the flesh.
[time=2723] And we don't know exactly what that was but it was a continual plaguing of his life so that he would stay teachable so that he would stay humble so that he would continue to be focusing on the fact that he needed to be a man of character.
[time=2735] And as I shared with you several weeks ago if you track his life he begins by saying on the least of the apostles about midway in his life he says on the least of the saints and by the end of his life in the pastoral epistles he's saying on the least of all the sinners.
[time=2748] On the worst of all the sinners he continued to learn from God the depth and the scope of his sinfulness.
[time=2756] He was a teachable man he was a man of character.
[time=2761] So men of character are first teachable.
[time=2763] Secondly they are faithful and once God has taught the lesson he tends to want to test it and he brought an incredible test into Joseph's life.
[time=2773] Remember she was beautiful we don't know it never says that she was beautiful explicitly but she was pot of her's wife and in that day and age he would have had any kind of wife he wanted and if the first one didn't measure up he'd get rid of her and get another one and go on and on and on
[time=2785] until he found the one that looked just the way he wanted her to.
[time=2788] So we can guess that she was a rather beautiful seductive luscious type of a woman and she saw at the end of verse 6 that Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
[time=2799] He was a looker this guy had a frame and a face and she was wanting to get her hands all over it and when you add to his physical appearance his character he must have been quite compelling.
[time=2814] Verse 7 it came about after these events that his master's wife looked with his desire at Joseph and she said lie with me but he refused and said it was master's wife behold with me here my master does not concern himself with anything in the house he has put me over all that he owns.
[time=2828] There is no one greater in the house than I and skipped to verse 10 for a minute it came about as she spoke to Joseph day after day.
[time=2837] Over and over and over and over again she would solicit Joseph and I have to believe it wasn't just with her words it must have been with her attire and the posture she would sit and lie in in various ways of communicating her illicit sexual intentions.
[time=2851] Over and over and over again verse 11 it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work and none of the men were in the household.
[time=2859] In other words she had somehow behind the scenes dismissed everybody so he had no accountability he was all by himself with her so that she could then grab a hold of his garment verse 12 and say lie with me.
[time=2871] I mean this is a test the great news is he was found faithful he said no back up in verse 9 how could I do this great evil and sin against my God.
[time=2884] He turned and he fled outside in fact he was in such a hurry he didn't even stop to gather up the garment that she had clutching in her hand and ripped off his body as he left.
[time=2895] Mind you here is a young man we don't know exactly how old he has been thrown in a pit he has been sold as a slave he has risen to a great of great prominence God is blessing his life he's full of success at this point in his life he's over the entire house.
[time=2912] If you know anything about temptation and how to stand against temptation you know your most vulnerable when you are successful in life and at the peak of his success to this point in his life he is hit with an onslaught of temptation by a persistent woman and he says no and he's found faithful to God he's a man of character.
[time=2932] But what happens next is most mind boggling you'd expect God to reward him again you'd expect God to give him more blessing but instead God allows him to be thrown in the king's dungeon.
[time=2942] The woman is outraged by his refusal she's obviously embarrassed and shamed and so she charges him of attempted rape as she has his garment as some level of proof and of course there were no witnesses because they were all outside of the house.
[time=2955] Verse 20 Joseph's master took him and put him into jail. Now it's interesting that the chief executioner of the land didn't kill him for that because that would have been common practice in that day but again the grace of God is in his life and so instead he's just thrown into the prison.
[time=2972] So now he's tested at the pinnacle of his success to date and he's found faithful he gets thrown back now in the prison in a worse place than he began and he stays faithful to God he doesn't turn his back on God.
[time=2985] How do you know that look at verse 21 but the Lord was with Joseph and extended kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
[time=2999] We believe he's been in Egypt for 13 years to his family he's dead.
[time=3004] He's been given success by God in Potiphar's house he resisted temptation and instead of reward he got punishment he's thrown into jail accused of attempted rape.
[time=3014] If it's me I'm ready to quit on God and say forget the whole thing but Joseph stays faithful and God continues to bless.
[time=3023] And I want to just indicate to you how deep I think Joseph's character went in all of recorded scripture from the age of 20 until he's 110 when he finally dies.
[time=3039] There is no record of a slanderous vengeful cutting remark at his brothers who sold him into slavery who hated him and sold him into slavery.
[time=3053] You will search the record in vain to find him at any point spewing out anger and bitterness and revenge words of anger at his brothers.
[time=3067] Instead as we will see later in the message it's only words of love and forgiveness.
[time=3073] Joseph was teachable and Joseph was faithful which made him available available to who available to God.
[time=3082] And God used this man in unbelievable ways turn to chapter forty one and look at verse forty one forty one forty one forty one forty one.
[time=3096] Joseph is standing before Pharaoh. And Pharaoh says now Pharaoh is obviously the king the leader.
[time=3105] He's over one of the most powerful nations in the world. This isn't just Potiphar's house. This is it.
[time=3112] This is the leader of one of the strongest nations of the world. I have sent you over all the land of Egypt.
[time=3118] Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand and clothed them in garments of fine linen and put gold necklace around his neck.
[time=3126] And he made him right in his second chariot and they proclaimed before him bow the knee.
[time=3131] And he set him over all the land of Egypt in all the territory which was Egypt's he gave to Joseph.
[time=3138] Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph though I am Pharaoh yet without your permission no one shall raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
[time=3147] Verse forty six Joseph was thirty years old.
[time=3152] That's it. You don't go any higher than that. God doesn't exalt you any further than that.
[time=3159] And you figure out how in the world you go from being a slave then to being thrown in prison and shortly thereafter you are exalted to being the number two man in charge of one of the most powerful nations on the earth to where nobody in that land
[time=3176] can raise a finger without your permission. You have the signet ring of the king which means you can obligate him in business transactions.
[time=3185] You can move his finances. You have full sway of his army. Everything the man had Joseph had complete control.
[time=3195] He goes from pit to pinnacle from prison to palace from being a slave to virtually being a king.
[time=3203] Did you say how that happened? Was it his ingenuity? Was it his giftedness? Was he exceptionally bright?
[time=3212] Was he a talented politician? Did he have some social skill that allowed him to move in this direction? Not at all.
[time=3222] Come back to chapter thirty nine for just a minute you'll see it.
[time=3226] They say it so many times in these several chapters you get tired of reading it. The repetition is overwhelming.
[time=3233] Chapter thirty nine verse two the Lord was with Joseph so he became successful.
[time=3238] Verse three his master saw that the Lord was with him and how the Lord caused all that he did to prosper in his hand.
[time=3245] The middle of verse five the Lord blessed the Egyptians house on account of Joseph.
[time=3250] In twenty one the Lord was with Joseph and extended kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
[time=3256] Verse twenty three at the end of the verse the Lord was with him and whatever he did the Lord made to prosper.
[time=3263] It was just unbelievable. None of this is attributed to Joseph. Joseph was first teachable and faithful.
[time=3269] That made him available. He was a pure vessel in the hand of God and then God began to pour his spirit through this man to change the course of human history.
[time=3278] Just by virtue of his being available. And Joseph knew it. Joseph was perfectly aware of it.
[time=3286] Look at chapter forty one verse sixteen. Remember Pharaoh had those dreams and they only knew of one man in the whole kingdom that could answer or solve the dreams or explain the dreams and that was Joseph.
[time=3299] And so he comes before Pharaoh and he says this in verse sixteen Joseph then answered Pharaoh saying it is not in me.
[time=3308] God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer. Look up a verse verse fifteen. I have had a dream but no one can interpret it.
[time=3318] And I have heard it said about you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it. I mean he's already just got a perfect entree into saying well yes Pharaoh as a matter of fact I do have that talent.
[time=3332] I am capable of these feats. In fact I've done it several times in the past. But he just actually decries the whole situation. It's not me.
[time=3340] If there's anything that's good it's going to come out of this. It's not going to come from me. God will give you the answer.
[time=3347] Now you might be thinking well he could have been trying to bribe God at that point so that God would indeed give him the revelation so that once the revelation is made then he could take credit for himself. Look at verse twenty eight.
[time=3357] After he interprets the dream it is as I have spoken Pharaoh God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
[time=3365] So before the interpretation and after the interpretation Joseph refuses to take any credit for what God is doing in his life and gives all of the glory to his God.
[time=3376] And if that would be a significant other in which you'd want to brag or before which you'd want to brag as you know before the king of the land how about wanting to brag in front of your brothers.
[time=3385] When some years later they're starving and destitute they're on the brink of death because they have no food and this whole grandiose scheme is being unveiled before their very eyes.
