[time=1] The passage we come to this morning describes the apostasy of so-called believers, people
[time=7] who have affirmed the truth, people who understand the truth, people who have claimed to even believe the truth, but who have fallen away, who have departed from the truth.
[time=17] We'll study this morning the five elements of apostasy.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=38] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=40] Thank you for joining us.
[time=41] Apostasy.
[time=42] Isn't that something that happens to people in other churches?
[time=45] You know the ones I mean, they once stood for the truth, but they've fallen away, or no longer stand for the biblical principles that were once important to them.
[time=54] Well before we judge others, let's be sure we understand just what's involved.
[time=59] Today Pastor Rouse will be examining the five elements of apostasy.
[time=62] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy.
[time=67] We'll be looking in particular at chapter 4 verses 1 through 5.
[time=73] Our special music today includes the sanctuary choir singing Jesus' reigns.
[time=77] And just before Pastor Rouse's message, Kevin Rowe will be singing "Beneath Your Blood."
[time=83] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's join the congregation as they sing about our Savior's love with the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer."
[time=117] Oh the world wants its honor, one the first is let me pray.
[time=124] Say no sing the hymn, "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer." "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer." "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer." Oh the Father, will sing the hymn, "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer."
[time=145] "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer."
[time=153] "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer." "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer."
[time=171] "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer."
[time=190] "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "I Will Sing of My Redeemer."
[time=225] "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn, "Beneath your Father."
[time=255] "Beneath your Father, will sing the hymn."

[time=543] Hello, and again, thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=547] So this has been another busy week with the Women's Retreat and the Children's Musical going to all the world.
[time=554] That kind of started off with a missions emphasis tonight on May 10th at 6 p.m.
[time=559] We have more about missions from our church.
[time=562] You know, it's fantastic to see the people rallying together around the theme of missions and sending the gospel to the nations of the world.
[time=569] It's a privilege to be a part of that whole process.
[time=571] I like it when the kids get involved in their Sunday school classes at an early age beginning to know our missionaries and what they do on the field in their purpose.
[time=579] That's very important.
[time=581] Also, the Kingsman Quartet from Cedarville College will be here if you're watching in Fort Wayne.
[time=586] That'll be tonight on May 10th.
[time=588] I hope that you'll come and join us for that 6 p.m.
[time=590] service right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=593] And also last week we talked about an exciting day on May 17th.
[time=597] That's going to be a very busy day, but most importantly, at 6 p.m. we're going to have Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=603] That's right, and we're thankful that John can be with us.
[time=606] He's back in the area.
[time=607] Be up, I guess, in Elkhart, Indiana for a stewardship seminar and you can call us at the church here if you like information about how you can attend that.
[time=616] We'll be in town for two or three days as well as some other great men of God who will be speaking to the issue of stewardship and finances, stewardship of the Word of God, and stewardship and missions.
[time=626] But our privilege is to have him here Sunday evening, May 17th, and he'll be speaking and I'm looking forward to that very much.
[time=632] I know that our people are too.
[time=634] And once again, Russell has mentioned this stewardship conference.
[time=636] It's at the first Baptist Church in Elkhart.
[time=639] Dr. Paul Dixon from Cedarville will be there.
[time=642] Dr. Wendell Kempton is the President of the Association of Baptist for World Evangelism and Jim Rickard will be there.
[time=649] He's the President of the Stewardship Foundation in California along with Dr. John MacArthur.
[time=655] If you'd like more information about that, you can just call the church here and we'd be glad to give you information concerning that conference beginning on May 18th.
[time=666] And then I want to talk to you about an interesting thing that we came across that I think is very appropriate for the summer time.
[time=673] They're called Bible Character Cards.
[time=675] If you're a grandparent and you have young grandchildren that might be coming to visit you this summer, this might be a great opportunity.
[time=683] There are 72 different Bible characters, their picture, and then a little description about their lives in this packet of cards.
[time=691] Be a great exercise in learning and a lot of fun for your grandchildren.

[time=703] You can receive these cards by writing to the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=725] And then Russell, this is around Mother's Day, but this is a great book that we've been talking about, "God's Gift for Mothers." It's appropriate for any time, and I just love the content of this book.

[time=828] I hope that you'll stay tuned with us.
[time=831] [MUSIC - 218 seconds]
[time=1079] Thanks Kevin. Amen beneath the blood.
[time=1087] Well as we continue to worship the Lord this morning, let me invite you to take your Bibles and open them to the book of 1 Timothy chapter 4 and we'll continue in our study of this pastoral epistle written by the Apostle Paul
[time=1103] to his true child in the faith, Timothy, whom he had left in Ephesus to encourage and strengthen and structure the church at Ephesus and we're going to study the first five verses of 1 Timothy chapter 4 and if you'll follow along allow me to read it so we can set it in our minds as we approach it.
[time=1122] But the Spirit explicitly says that in latter times some will fall away from the faith
[time=1128] paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons by means of the hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron
[time=1139] men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth for everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude for it is sanctified by means of the word of God
[time=1158] and prayer. Now the key to understanding this passage is found in a phrase in verse 1
[time=1166] some will fall away from the faith some will fall away from the faith
[time=1173] and if this has ever happened to someone who is close to you a relative or someone in the church that you've discipled or opened your life up to you know that it is one of the most discouraging and devastating aspects in all of Christianity. Her name was Cindy. Cindy I met Cindy
[time=1191] several years ago when I was pastoring at Grace Community Church she had made a profession of faith she was about 18 or 19 years of age she had a ferocious appetite for the word of God so she enrolled in the Lagos Bible Institute a one-year Bible program at Grace Community Church a full curriculum of studies of each book of the New Testament and doctrine and theology and all the rest.
[time=1213] She did unbelievably well in those classes being very bright she went on then to feel led into ministry and service she joined the junior high staff of which I was the pastor she served the first year as just a normal staff person in a rather rigorous schedule she discipled some young ladies in the eighth grade did a fine job with that she went on then in subsequent years to become an assistant lead teacher we called it she could do some administrative responsibilities for the eighth grade girls and teach from time to time and she did well with that and then the next year she became the lead teacher and all of the staff that worked with those eighth grade girls there were about sixty girls and about eight staff members and all of the care and the administration and the shepherding and the teaching fell to her then I left Grace Community Church and went to work for the Masters College I lost contact with her for several years but then one of her friends called me and said Cindy has left the church Cindy is now living with an unbeliever Cindy has denied her faith and Heidi and I getting word of that track Cindy down and cordially invited her to our home for dinner and I'll never forget that evening as long as I live we sat out on the porch on a cool summer warm summer evening eating dinner in a very friendly way tried to find out what in the world had happened to Cindy throughout the conversation she was cool she was calm she was purposeful and very intentional in her deliberate dispossessing of the truth she once affirmed she no longer believed in Jesus Christ as her Savior she no longer believed the word of God she no longer believed that she would go to hell if she didn't she just didn't believe that stuff anymore and in a very deliberate rejection of Christ dispossessed herself of the truth she had studied affirmed and even taught to others and second
[time=1321] Chronicles chapter 25 you don't need to turn there I'm only going to read a few verses is the account of one of the kings of Judah his name is King Amaziah the account begins in verse two this way and he did write in the sight of the Lord yet not with a whole heart King Amaziah was one who had learned the
[time=1340] religious system of Israel he had a professed faith if you will in that he affirmed the truth of the only true and living God in Yahweh he had learned the religious system of Israel he functioned and behaved within its structure and was even a leader of it but not with a whole heart 12 verses later in chapter
[time=1361] 25 you come to the shocking words that he set up the gods of Edom and bowed down
[time=1367] before them and burned incense to them the account of his life goes on until he is tragically murdered by his own people in the closing common and statement about his life is in verse 27 it says Amaziah turned away from following the
[time=1382] Lord apostasy apostasy someone who departs from the faith we're not talking
[time=1391] about a momentary frustration with God and the way your life is working and so you in your heart retract from the kinds of feelings you might have had about God in the past and you struggle in your frustration on a momentary level we're not talking about the earnest questioning of a believer even the serious doubts that a believer may have about how God is administrating life in their life or about some doctrine like the sovereignty of God or the origin of sin and there may be room for some significant struggles and battles with questions about what the scripture is trying to say that's not what we're talking about in apostasy and what is in view here in this passage that's falling away from the faith in the Greek it's apostidzo it means to have the purposeful intentional deliberate dispossessing of truth once affirmed they knew the truth
[time=1441] they understood the truth they obeyed the truth but because their heart was never really given to God because they never really entered into a personal relationship with God they fell away from the faith Hebrews chapter 3 verse 12 says it this way take care brethren a word that oftentimes encompasses real believers and just professing believers take care brethren lest there should be in any one of you an evil unbelieving heart in falling away from the living God
[time=1472] people were apostasizing in the city of Ephesus they were doing that in the old testament as we saw by way of example in King Amaziah and they are doing it today and when it happens it is a shocking blow to your system you feel as though you've been punched in the stomach and you've had the wind knocked out of you and you're gasping for some way to understand the situation the passage in front of us this morning explains such a departure from the faith it gives five elements of apostasy and let me tell you what they are and then we'll study each one the predictability of apostasy the source of apostasy the human agents of
[time=1510] apostasy the teaching of apostasy and the air of apostasy let's begin in verse one
[time=1517] with the predictability of apostasy but the spirit explicitly says that in
[time=1524] latter times some will fall away from the faith the spirit explicitly says that's
[time=1531] just another way of communicating divine revelation the spirit had indicated that people would apostasize in the old testament the spirit of God is saying that in these latter times and that by the way is a phrase used in 1 John 2 18 children it is the last hour 1 Peter 1 20 Christ has appeared to us in these
[time=1551] last times Hebrews 1 12 talking about how God has communicated to us through prophets but now in these last days he has spoken to us in his son basically these last times these latter times include the period of time or the dispensation between the first and second coming of Christ that period in which you and I live the spirit explicitly says to expect apostasy people backing out
[time=1577] of the faith it's helpful that he warns us of the warns us of that reality so
[time=1583] that we're not caught unaware we're not shocked unduly by it though it is tragic it is not unexpected and it should not cause us to question the reality of our faith the reality of our Christian doctrine and our belief in God so Paul
[time=1598] says that in these latter times some will fall away from the faith you can expect it now look at the first word of that verse but it sets up a contrast it sets up a contrast from what we studied last week at the end of verse 15 in chapter 3 the church of the living God the pillar and support of the truth the church is on the planet to uphold and to edify and to make attractive the truth of the living God and to fortress it or to bulwark the truth we noted in verse 16 that the
[time=1629] principle part of all that truth the foundation on which all the truth sets is none other than the person of Jesus Christ who has explained in this early Christian hymn given to the church he was revealed in the flesh vindicated in the spirit be held by angels proclaimed among the nations believed on in the world and taken up in glory though the church's mission is to stand for the truth to garnish the truth with flesh and blood and to love people into the kingdom of God and to show how the truth works out in tangible ways we are to expect that in these latter times there will be an increasing rising movement of apostasy against the truth for which we stand it's predictable secondly the source where does this apostasy come from where does this movement
[time=1678] find its origin you'll find that at the end of verse one as well people paying attention to deceitful spirits and doctrines of demons what is in view here
[time=1689] is the demonic host the demons the former angels that fell with Satan when he
[time=1696] rebelled against God these are personalities these are real entities though they are spirits and we cannot see handle or touch them unless they take on human flesh which they at times can't either indwell or give the form of we cannot see them but they are real and they have an agenda their character is described as deceitful spirits they are seducing spirits they are liars and they love to propagate lies and they love to lure people away from the truth of God to damning doctrine that they might spend forever in hell
[time=1730] this phrase doctrines of demons this is not demonology this is not the study of demons this is not teaching about demons this is the teaching of demons this is the theology that demons present to the world to lead them in the hell this doctrines of demons is not a study about demons which we could do from the word of God but it is instead the doctrines which demons propagate teach preach embellish guide people in lead people in as they seduce them away from the truth
[time=1761] all false religion and all idols propagate demon doctrine and are
[time=1767] energized by demonic spirits 2 Corinthians 11 14 says that Satan and his angelic hosts are disguised as angels of light they come in the appearance of religion they come in the appearance of helping people they come in the appearance of trying to better society they don't come with black and skulls and darkness and death and
[time=1790] the stench of Gehenna all over them instead they come with the facade of religion they are masked as angels of light but nevertheless it's still demons of doctrines
[time=1802] and it's still the energizing demons behind the facade of religion that is driving and sourcing the entire thing and idol is more than carved wood covered with some
[time=1813] type of precious metal and a religious system whether it be some false religious church or some foreign eastern religion whatever it is out there is more than a system of belief propagated by men idols are not just the product of the
[time=1829] ingenuity of a man to try to get a hold of nature and worship this idol to make some part of nature obey his command or win and false teachers and false churches
[time=1840] and false religious systems are more than just the divining of men to think up
[time=1846] things to do religiously they are instead and ultimately energized by demons and
[time=1853] they are propagating demon doctrine Leviticus 17 7 says as much that when
[time=1859] men sacrifice to idols they sacrifice to demons Deuteronomy 32 17 says the same
[time=1865] thing when you sacrifice to an idol you are really sacrificing to the demon behind the idol Psalm 106 verses 36 to 39 tell us describe a people who were
[time=1877] serving idols and sacrificing their daughters to demons first Corinthians 10
[time=1884] talks about coming to the Lord's table and then going to the table of the pagans and it calls at the table of demons you cannot serve the Lord and the table of demons so we should not be so naive as to assume that the idol is just
[time=1898] the product of human ingenuity human attempt to worship the same would be said
[time=1904] of their false religion is not just simply a collection of ideas as it appears to be on the surface it is instead energized by demonic and fallen angels and a satanic system of spirits who are through that means seducing men and women into
[time=1920] eternal hell apostasy is demon seduction idol worship is demon worship and false
[time=1928] teachers are demon agents it's just that simple in the word of God and it
[time=1934] happens as you'll notice again in verse one people pay attention to it it could have been stronger translation could have come across a little stronger it could have been cling to to attach yourself to when these people who are posing as Christians who are in the flow of Christianity who are giving affirmation to the doctrine the faith of the church finally get a hold of some good demon
[time=1958] doctrine they cling to it they pay attention to it they ascribe to it and they hang on to it and so instead of listening to the spirit of God who leads us into truth John 16 13 they are led into damnation and falsehood and error by these
[time=1973] demons abandoning the faith and clinging to demon doctrine so it is predictable
[time=1982] its source is none other than Satan himself through his world system energized by the demons so we've seen basically three personalities or groups
[time=1995] here we've seen the spirit of God himself explicitly predicting this we have seen the demon spirits who are behind it all and then we have seen the apostates who fall away now a fourth party comes into view in verse two and these would be the human agents themselves of the demon doctrine the false teachers look at it in verse two by means of hypocrisy of liars seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron the source is supernatural the means of
[time=2023] communicating that source to the masses is natural they are men who are hypocritical lie speakers hypocritical or rather hypocrites who lie that may be
[time=2035] the best translation these are men who are hypocrites and they lie they look helpful they look kind they look as though they would assist you in your religious enterprise to some benevolent end they are wearing the mask of religion the facade of religion sometimes they carry a bible sometimes they carry a prayer book sometimes they carry beads sometimes they wear robes sometimes they're priests or pastors or professors in colleges and universities and they find an audience and they seduce that audience into the lies of the demon doctrine and you say how can they do that how can they lead people away from the
[time=2073] truth and into damnation and the answer is also found in verse two it is that they are seared seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron the
[time=2084] Greek word behind the word seared is a medical term to cauterize and I understand that when a physician would cauterize a situation he would burn the flesh it would form scar tissue and then it would become insensitive to feeling and that is the nature being drawn here by Paul these men have been burned in their conscience
[time=2105] such that the scar tissue if you will has developed and they're insensitive to the things which God had given them at birth as you know God has given every human being basically in their conscience a copy of the ten commandments the morality of God is there and when people in the world violate that law of God there is a twinge of guilt there is a conviction of guilt and shame and justice that comes with it these men have been so indoctrinated to the demon
[time=2132] doctrines so engulfed in their sinfulness and their sinful practices and their culture that they have seared their conscience with a branding iron it's vividly descriptive language to describe they have no conscience they don't
[time=2146] care they don't even feel a twinge of guilt over what they do they may even
[time=2152] speak out of a heartfelt conviction that this is the way life should be lived
[time=2158] I think of my own fear of teaching something in error from the word of God
[time=2165] I think of the trepidation that I have as I prepare to to present you the
[time=2171] truth of the gospel every Sunday and I know those of you who are in the process of teaching the word of God share that fear the last thing in the world you ever want to do is get it wrong is teach people wrong is communicate something that isn't intended for them to have from the word of God these men have no concern for that they have no thought about it they don't wake up and lay it awake at night wondering did I translate that verse right or did I interpret that verse right because they're seared in their conscience as with a branding
[time=2203] iron what are they teaching what are they teaching well look at it in verse three
[time=2210] men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has
[time=2217] created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth you're thinking man that's not too bad I mean after that kind of a buildup we got demons going on we got demon doctrine being propagated through men's whose conscience are seared and that's all they come up with forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from food I mean after all Jesus through the Apostle Paul and 1 Corinthians 7 gave great respect to celibacy to single people who would
[time=2242] not be involved in marriage what's so wrong with that and what's wrong with having a careful diet of abstaining from certain foods I mean wouldn't a Christian want to have that kind of discipline in their life and not just throw themselves wantly at food so there is in a sense an element of truth and that is always the way it is with good deception there is a measure of truth the teaching behind these simple little phrases men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from food is called asceticism and it's a self works self righteous religious system that says I can become acceptable to God based on holding myself back from
[time=2279] perfectly acceptable things I will abstain from marriage and earn brownie points with God I will abstain from certain kinds of food and earn brownie points with God true spirituality they say is attained by what we do or what we do not
[time=2295] do we will become acceptable to God as we refrain from certain things it is the
[time=2303] religion of human achievement the religion of human achievement and it is absolutely opposite to the gospel of Jesus Christ the gospel of Jesus Christ is the
[time=2314] reality of divine accomplishment Jesus did it all he paid the complete price he was the perfect lamb sacrificed without spot and I can add nothing to his sacrifice I can add nothing to his work he has done it all for me is simply to accept it by the grace of God through faith I can do nothing to enhance my standing before God because in Christ my standing before God is perfect demon doctrine is the opposite demon doctrine is not the religion of divine accomplishment it is the doctrine of human accomplishment and anytime you hear it in any form and it comes in thousands of forms in fact every religion in the world can be grouped in one of two categories divine accomplishment or human accomplishment and whether it's the Buddhist faith or Confucism or Islam or the Mormon church or the Catholic church or whatever it is wherever there is human achievement human achievement I must add to my salvation I must become acceptable to God by some effort either abstaining from certain things or doing good deeds it is demon doctrine it is absolutely contrary to the truth of the gospel which Paul reiterated in chapter one you remember he said in the grace
[time=2387] of our Lord was more than abundant with the faith and love which are found in
[time=2393] Christ Jesus Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners among whom I am
[time=2399] chief I am foremost he makes no attempt to add to his salvation to earn his
[time=2406] salvation to find acceptability before God in fact his entire life up to meeting Jesus Christ on the Damascus road had been one long pharasiacal attempt to be pleasing in the side of God and he was better than his contemporaries but when met with the reality that he was sinful before God despite his best efforts he submitted to the truth of the gospel and accepted the religion of divine accomplishment demon doctrine is the opposite demon doctrine is damning because it offers the false hope that you can earn your salvation went to lunch this
[time=2440] was a student from IPFW who had written a very sarcastic demeaning paper that
[time=2446] was supposed to be somewhat of an intellectual approach against Christianity and one of the professors there who knows me and is a Christian was concerned about this young man and so gave me the paper and I called him and said could we have lunch and we got together and was a very interesting time having read his
[time=2466] paper and he had great concerns about the virgin birth and great concerns about the synoptic gospels and how certain men could see the same account and give different reports and he just felt the Bible was so full of inerrancy that you could in no way trust it or believe it as a rule of practice and faith and I said
[time=2482] to him my opening question was have you ever read the New Testament and his answer was no have you ever read half of the New Testament no well then how do
[time=2494] you critique the New Testament well I have read from great thinkers who have read
[time=2501] the New Testament and they have told me all of these things and I was raised in somewhat of a religious home and I've seen the church and I know what is wrong with the church I said well thank you very much I said do you understand the central message of the New Testament he says yes I do I said would you tell me just the central message of the new he says it's this God in the New
[time=2526] Testament has given men a code of behavior a code ethic a list of do's and
[time=2533] don'ts and man is required to live up to the do's and don'ts of the New
[time=2539] Testament and if he does he not only helps society but he earns salvation in heaven and I said my friend that is the absolute opposite of the New
[time=2551] Testament message the New Testament message says nothing about keeping God's laws to earn so he said well wait a minute what about the Ten Commandments that's why God gave the Ten Commandments and I said to him the reason that God gave the people the Ten Commandments was so that they could prove to themselves that there is absolutely no way they could ever earn salvation we humans have a
[time=2576] remarkable ability to rationalize our thought processes and justify our behavior and say well I'm not Charles Manson I didn't murder a bunch of people I'm not a thief I didn't do all these horrible and grossly sinful things so I must be okay and when God evaluates me the scale will tip in my favor and I'll get to heaven and to prevent that type of foolish damning demon doctrine thinking
[time=2600] God gave the Old Testament and the New Testament and there is a behavioral code there but it is for the explicit purpose of showing us that we can't cut it so that we can then say human accomplishment will never make it I must rely solely and completely upon the grace of Jesus Christ and I accept it by faith his complete and total sacrifice amending and paying for and propitiating an angry God against my sin so that I can be free of his wrath demon doctrine and this
[time=2631] young student without knowing it had read from the demon agents his professors and his writers who were convincing him that the Bible was wrong and that he didn't even know he had taken massive doses of demon doctrine was believing it and
[time=2646] seduced on a path to hell and I regret to say though I gave him the little book CS Lewis mere Christianity and offered him my phone number that he could call me at any time it would be to my great surprise should he do that so swept up in the wisdom of the world is he to think of stooping so low as to accepting the
[time=2666] reality that the Jesus Christ of the New Testament did indeed die and was raised from the dead as a proof that he was God and that salvation is free so they
[time=2677] their doctrine or their teaching is one of abstinence it is ultimately one of human accomplishment and it leads a person to hell specifically though about this
[time=2688] teaching Paul responds with their error he exposes it for what it is look again at verse three men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth for everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude two times in those two verses the word gratitude comes up
[time=2713] and it is the key to understanding the error of their way why did God give us
[time=2719] marriage why did God institute marriage in the garden of Eden he saw that Adam was alone he saw that it was not good that he should be alone and so God gave him Eve as a help made as a companion as a life partner to be mutually enjoyed the two of them in the covenant of a one flesh relationship forever God gave
[time=2739] marriage marriage is not wrong marriage is good God gave it to be enjoyed
[time=2745] why did God give food I mean why didn't God just make the world all one big place where we just ate porridge all the time I mean why all the different kinds of fruits and the different kinds of meats and the different kinds of wheat and that we can make all the different kinds of bread and the vast arrangement of the full menu of food well because he wanted us to enjoy it God wanted us to
[time=2770] realize that he had made us with taste buds that could touch the broad range of foods which are out there that we could enjoy you might come with me to first say chapter six for a minute look at verse 17 it sums up the whole thing only it's not marriage or food it's money instruct those verse 17 chapter six who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches now notice he doesn't condemn the riches he condemns putting your faith in the riches put your faith and your hope on God and it's that God who richly supplies us with what all things to enjoy the money that God
[time=2809] has given you the standard of living at what she allows you to live you know why he's given that to you so you can enjoy it there is no condemnation of the money or the having of money only the loving of money as it says in verse 10 for the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil so the very clear principle in your life should be this if God has been gracious to me in a wonderful marriage or if I'm sitting down to a beautifully spread meal with all my favorite foods you know what that is there for me to enjoy that is an expression of God's goodness in my life you know what God wants you to do in response to that he wants you to be grateful he wants you to be grateful and express that gratitude and I guess that's where our tradition of praying before the meal comes from to say thanks the giving of thanks but it's not just a prayer you understand it's not just something we do before meal when we are grateful for what God has given us in our marriage and in our food and in our standard of living and our health and in our mental faculties and in our church and everything that God has given us when we pause in gratitude to say thanks we are glorifying the creator who gave it and that is why he originally created all of it God has created the whole thing for his own glory he's created you for his glory he's created marriage for his glory he's created food for his marriage for his glory he's created your home for his glory he's created this church for his glory and when we as believers understand that he is the giver of all these good things and we take them and we enjoy them as he intended for us to do and then a heart of gratitude responds with a spontaneous response of thanksgiving and gratitude we glorify him and the cycle is complete and we honor him as he should be honored and that's the problem with asceticism no don't take marriage don't take these foods don't take this money don't take this don't take that don't do this don't do that and all it does is rob God the glory that he has designed to have for himself through your rightful enjoyment and then your grateful pleasure and saying thanks so the error of this way is one
[time=2934] the failure to thank and praise God secondly their error was to fail to
[time=2940] understand that everything that God made was good not evil everything that God
[time=2947] made is good not evil and they failed to understand that and then thirdly they had a failure to believe what the word says about it look at verse five for it
[time=2958] is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer let's take marriage for a minute marriage is sanctified by means of the word of God and prayer believer
[time=2969] believers and unbelievers get married but it is the believer that approaches his marriage through the grid of the word of God it is the believer who studies the word of God to understand the role of the husband the role of the wife the way to treat the children the emphases of how finances should be spent within that marriage it is the it is the believer who comes to the word of God and says you have given us this marvelous thing called marriage now teach me how I'm supposed to function in it sanctify my marriage by means of my study of the word of God and then prayer that personal application of the word of God to your specific situation to your specific marriage and that is what brings the whole thing together and only believers do that that is what keeps the marriage within bounds that is what prohibits the abuses that go on inside of marriage inside and outside of marriage sexually in the physical abuse and the hardship and the crisis and the pain that people have inside of marriage because they don't go to the God who gave them marriage and then gave them the word of God so that they could study how their marriage should be and live that out same would be true of food food is neither to be denied nor to be
[time=3038] overindulged in and the word of God tells us the balance and the wisdom and the way of food and over and over again in the Bible food is the occasion of Christian fellowship the coin onia around the dinner table around the lunch around the breakfast and around the food which God has heaped upon us especially in our country but that is all done according to the word of God as we study it and learn to live our lives and thank Him for it in prayer so apostasy the falling
[time=3068] away the deliberate dispossessing of truth once known once understood and
[time=3075] once affirmed you say explain that to me well first of all expect it is not
[time=3082] unusual it should not be alarming as if something out of the sovereignty of God is occurring it should obviously be very tragic in your heart as you think about those who apostasize but it should not catch you unawares these are the days in which apostasy will come you say where does it come from demons come from the
[time=3102] pit of hell real live demons who are characterized by their deceitful
[time=3108] seducing spirits and they propagate their own teaching and doctrine which though it comes out in many different ways and many different forms is always human achievement human achievement human achievement you say how do they
[time=3124] spread that to the natural world they do it through natural men who have an unnatural level of hypocrisy in their lives they are liars and it doesn't bother them because they have no sensitivity left left in their God-given conscience they burned it sizzled it you say what is it what is this false teaching
[time=3144] what is this demon doctrine forbidding of marriage abstaining from foods human achievement earn your way become acceptable on your own don't do it do anything except accepting Jesus Christ and His full provision what is the error it robs God of his glory it robs God of his glory what God wants you to do with the good things he has given he wants you to fully enjoy them according to the word of God say thanks to him for an honor and glorify him as your creator it's a
[time=3173] beautiful picture of living life in relationship with Jesus Christ amaziah amaziah did what was right in the side of the Lord amaziah affirmed
[time=3187] truth for a period obeyed truth but not with a whole heart not with a whole heart
[time=3196] and he turned into an apostate he turned away from following the Lord
[time=3205] where's your heart today where's your heart are you here because you love God
[time=3213] are you here because you're thankful you're alive are you here because you're recognizing as your creator your Lord your sovereign who gave you the breath you just took and you want to learn to worship him you're so thankful for these songs on Sunday morning you can stand up and just let the emotions of praise gush out of your heart and when you hear the word of God you want to submit you want to change your life you want to conform these areas of your life to the word of God or are you just here has somebody drug you here again has
[time=3250] somebody drug you here again is this putting in time and you're just waiting
[time=3256] to hear the siren voices of the demons and be drawn completely and totally away from the truth let's pray
[time=3269] Father we love you man we love you you're everything to us you're the beginning
[time=3279] and the end we anticipate leaving this building and going out into a beautiful
[time=3285] day an atmosphere which protects our frail human physical bodies it gives us
[time=3291] everything we need to live to sustain life and goes beyond that to a feeling
[time=3297] of just invigoration because the atmosphere is so pleasant you're the giver of that you're the giver of that and we thank you we want to enjoy it with grateful hearts we want to glorify you as creator there is no other you are
[time=3313] the only God you are the reason we are here while I pray for Cindy today I don't know where she is I don't know what she's doing
[time=3323] but I pray that the spirit of God would crush into her life
[time=3330] and give her true salvation grant her repentance life everlasting
[time=3339] for the family members and friends represented in the group of people here today who also know of apostates people who have renounced the faith and walked away we pray for them not by name but you know their names and we come together as a body of believers beseeching you the sovereign one for their salvation and if there is one even in this room today who has been wearing a mask
