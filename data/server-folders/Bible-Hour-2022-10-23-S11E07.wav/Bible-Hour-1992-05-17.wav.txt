[time=0] Is your pastor doing a good job, is he meeting your expectations?
[time=6] I would ask you this question, what standard are you using to evaluate his performance?
[time=12] The text we have this morning is 1 Timothy chapter 4 and it's going to give us God's standard for the pastor.
[time=19] It'll explain God expectations for the man and the ministry and in that highlight the good and excellent servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=40] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=47] Thank you for joining us.
[time=50] In the last several weeks, Pastor Moore has been leading us in a study of church leadership.
[time=54] Today he'll be looking at the particular office of Pastor Teacher.
[time=57] In today's business world, every job has a job description and a list of qualifications.
[time=62] Well God did not leave us with a blank sheet of paper, he's left us with a very definitive set of expectations for the man and his ministry.
[time=70] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of First Timothy.
[time=75] We'll be looking at chapter 4.
[time=79] Our special music today includes the sanctuary choir and orchestra singing and playing the majesty in glory of your name.
[time=86] And just before Pastor Russ's special message, whatever missionaries Jim Elliot will be singing "There is a Savior." As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's join Brian Loosen as he sings for the glory of the Lord.
[time=113] For the glory of the Lord, we have been created.
[time=139] Sing text of written work, mercy demonstrated, we are made a channel where his grace is bought.
[time=161] Witness of salvation for the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord.
[time=180] For the glory of the Lord, willingly we suffer, played upon this holy cross, dying with
[time=199] our brother, his divine fulfillment, our complete reward.
[time=214] For the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord.
[time=230] For the glory of the Lord, we advance united, following Christ's blazing sword, his dominion
[time=252] sighted, all that has been taken, his child he restored, this eternal anthem, for the
[time=271] glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord.
[time=291] [MUSIC]
[time=301] [APPLAUSE]
[time=306] 1 When I gaze into the night's eyes and see the world of your fingers,
[time=334] a new insights of standing in space, what is there?
[time=345] Our tears and let you are mindful of fear.
[time=355] You have given them a proud of glory and a new, and have made him a little older than
[time=370] the angels.
[time=372] You have put him in charge of our creation, the peace of the fear.
[time=382] Let me hear the fish of the sea.
[time=388] For what is meant, for what is meant, let you are mindful of fear.
[time=406] O Lord, our God, our majesty and glory of your name.

[time=3133] praise you, praise you,
[time=3169] praise you, praise you, praise you,
[time=3182] praise you, praise you,
[time=3196] Are you of the accepting, conciliating, approving nature of our day where only weirdos like Rush, Limba are confrontational?
[time=3214] Or are you willing to say, "You know something? I have a real concern. I'm willing to sound the alarm."
[time=3221] And by the way, a lot of the alarms that Rush is sounding are probably needed. But he's one of the few people that I think is around that's willing to just lose what I think.
[time=3230] But more important than the political arena, are you doing that spiritually in the life of your friends?
[time=3237] Secondly, do you saturate yourself in the Word of God?
[time=3242] Servanthood requires that. Servanthood requires the type of faithful indoctrination in the values of the Word of God.
[time=3251] Or we are so quickly torn from this truth and encroached in our understanding of the purpose of our life by demonic values.
[time=3263] Do you separate yourself from worldly doctrines? Or do you have an open mind? And are you striving for personal godliness?
[time=3274] I hope so. I hope so. Came across something this week I thought you might find interesting.
[time=3282] There's about calling a pastor to a church. One of the toughest tasks a church faces is choosing a good minister this little thing went.
[time=3291] One of the members of a search committee reached the place of absolute frustration with the rest of the committee because they continued to reject perfectly capable applicants.
[time=3300] So he presented to them a letter purporting to be from another applicant, which he really had himself written and said this way, gentleman.
[time=3308] Understanding that your pulpit is vacant. I should like to apply for the position. I have many qualifications.
[time=3316] I have been a preacher with much success. And I have also had some successes as a writer. Some say that I'm a good organizer.
[time=3324] I've been a leader in most of the places I've been and I'm about 50 years old.
[time=3329] However, I have never preached in one place for more than three years. In some places I have left town.
[time=3336] After my work has caused riots and disturbances. I must admit I have been in jail three or four times.
[time=3344] My health is not good, though I still do get a bunch of stuff done.
[time=3348] The churches I have preached in have been small, though often located in several large different cities.
[time=3354] I've not gotten along well with the religious leaders in towns where I have preached.
[time=3358] In fact, some have attacked me and threatened me physically. There have been fights.
[time=3362] I'm not too good at keeping records. I've been known to forget whom I've baptized.
[time=3368] However, if you can use me, I shall do my best for you.
[time=3373] The committee members reacted by saying, "Are you nuts? Are you crazy? We're going to hire an unhealthy trouble-making absent-minded ex-jailbird?"
[time=3383] That's when the man who wrote the letter said, "Well, it signed the Apostle Paul."
[time=3398] [MUSIC]
[time=3412] We've been sharing with you music from our Sanctuary Choir and soloist Brian Lowson.
[time=3417] Also had a special guest, one of our missionaries Jim Elliott sing for us this morning.
[time=3422] The message was from our pastor, Russell Moore.
[time=3425] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's bow and pray this prayer together.
[time=3433] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I am a sinner and that I need Jesus as my Savior.
[time=3440] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3445] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3449] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3453] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3461] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the package of 72 Bible character cards, please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3473] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1552, or mention the message by pastor, Russell Moore, entitled, qualities of an excellent pastor.
