[time=0] We're looking at the qualities of an excellent servant, a servant of Jesus Christ, a pastor.
[time=8] What are the qualities of an excellent pastor?
[time=10] Does your pastor meet your expectations?
[time=12] Well, maybe more importantly, the question should be asked, is your pastor meeting the expectations of the Word of God?
[time=18] Is he fulfilling the 12 imperatives of 1 Timothy, chapter 4?
[time=36] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=43] Thank you for joining us.
[time=48] Is your pastor doing a good job?
[time=50] Does he meet your expectations?
[time=53] Interesting questions, but perhaps the real question should be, do you know what expectations God has given for your pastor?
[time=60] Today, Pastor Moore will be continuing the message she began last week entitled, Qualifications of an Excellent Pastor.
[time=68] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament Book of First Timothy, we will be looking in at chapter 4 verses 6 through 16.
[time=78] Our special music today includes the sanctuary choir, singing a great anthem written specifically for Black Hawk by Bruce Greer entitled, "The Lord Rains."
[time=88] And just before Pastor Russ's message, Denise Mitchell will be singing, "He who began a good work in you." As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's join celebration as they sing, "Holy,
[time=104] Holy, Holy." "Holy, Holy, Holy."
[time=134] Lord, Lord Almighty, early in the morning, our song shall rise to thee, holy, holy,
[time=160] merciful and mighty, why in the verses, blessedry, to thee.
[time=183] Holy, Holy, Holy, all the saints are daw thee, casting down their golden crowns round
[time=207] the glass is seen, she'll all been encere of thee, falling down before thee, who would
[time=231] have ever known shall be.

[time=564] holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
[time=854] and our first one is coming up in just a few weeks.
[time=857] - June 3rd, Dr. Don Garrick, president of Summit Bible College, will be with us, and it just he kicks off really a series of speakers that will have each Wednesday night.
[time=866] We start at seven o'clock, and we want to invite any and all of you to come to that.
[time=870] If you're looking for some good, strong Bible preaching, be a part of our summer celebration of pastors as they come in, speakers from various areas.
[time=878] We'd love to have you join us for that.
[time=880] - Besides some of the speakers that we'll have, we'll have some special musical guests too, and we'll be announcing those from time to time.
[time=887] If you'd like to complete list of the special meetings that we're having on Wednesday night throughout June, July and August, just called the church, and I want to give you that number.
[time=897] It's Area Code 219-493-7400, and ask for the schedule of events for the Wednesday night summer celebration.
[time=908] If you're in this area and you're watching the broadcast today on May 31st at 6 p.m., we'll have the graduation exercises of the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=917] As I said before, if you're interested in Christian education, have children that are about to enter school, this might be an excellent time for you to come and visit and be involved in seeing the graduates, as well as the faculty for that graduation exercise, Sunday night, May 31st at 6 p.m.
[time=935] Then Russell, the Patriotic Panorama, is just around the corner.
[time=938] It's hard to believe that, but we're calling it Celebrate America.
[time=941] We've got some exciting events that'll be placed there.
[time=944] That's going to be on Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock, June 28th.
[time=949] Put that date aside Sunday afternoon, June 28th at 4 p.m., and we'll have more information concerning what's going to happen on that day.
[time=959] The Patriotic Panorama Celebrate America.
[time=963] And Russell, I was looking this weekend, Marge, our assistant in the Bible department area, said that all of the Bible character cards that we ordered for this month are gone.
[time=973] But we've reordered.
[time=975] Many of you have ordered the Bible character cards that we've been offering on the Bible hour.
[time=979] It's a set of 72 cards that have a picture of a Bible character, and then on the back, it has several sentences that describe that Bible character and then a verse.
[time=990] It's a great tool to teach your children and grandchildren of Bible characters.
[time=996] So you can still write for it.
[time=998] If you'd like to receive it just right to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1008] Once again, that's the Bible hour.
[time=1010] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1019] We're excited about the ministry of the Bible hour as well as the worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1025] If you watch regularly and you don't attend church, we'd love to have you come and visit on Sunday morning.
[time=1030] Our morning worship services are at 915 and 1050 right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 7,400 East State.
[time=1038] Those of you that can't get out to church, we're really grateful that you watch and support the Bible hour with your prayers.
[time=1044] I hope that you'll continue to do that.
[time=1046] We'll go back to the regular part of our service now with more music, and then the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=1080] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=1245] [MUSIC]â™ª
[time=1265] Hey, men.
[time=1267] It's one of my favorite songs.
[time=1269] It's based on my life verse, Philippians 1, 6.
[time=1272] He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ, the man that discipled me the first year of my Christian life, drilled that truth into my mind and my heart.
[time=1284] Together we believe that God could do something good in our lives.
[time=1289] Well, I'll invite you this morning to take your Bible, and we'll go back to our study of 1 Timothy chapter 4 verses 6 through 16.
[time=1299] And the theme of these 11 verses is all about the excellent pastor or the excellent minister, excellent meaning noble or admirable or good.
[time=1310] The servant in view here is not the do-loss or the slave of the New Testament, and that we're often used in terms of our Christian ministry, but deaconess and the emphasis there is on usefulness.
[time=1323] What makes a useful, helpful, noble, excellent, admirable pastor?
[time=1331] In seminary we would often dream about who we might become after graduation, and oftentimes we would find ourselves grabbing a hold of some of the big names and Christendom and finding ourselves not to just be one of those men, but to be a marvelous combination of several, possibly the notion of being the kind of preacher that would have the passion and the insight and the applications of Chuck Swindoll to have the biblical depth and penetrating knowledge of the word of God of John MacArthur, to have the understanding of people and the ability to counsel like James Dobson and the ability to raise money like Jerry Falwell.
[time=1375] And we came up with a name Chuck McDobwell.
[time=1379] Chuck McDobwell, that's who we were aspiring to be.
[time=1383] And then you graduate and you'll find out you're just yourself.
[time=1387] It's apparent that many, many pastors in America today are very discouraged in their ministries.
[time=1395] And I say this to you based on a survey of some 2,000 pastors who gathered last fall at Colorado Springs and responded rather candidly to a survey. Here are some of the results.
[time=1407] 90% of pastors worked more than 46 hours a week.
[time=1411] I don't see anything wrong with that. 80% believed that pastoral ministry is affecting their families negatively.
[time=1419] 33% said that being in the ministry was an outright hazard to their family. 75% reported a significant crisis due to stress at least once in their ministry.
[time=1431] Half of them felt unable to meet the needs of the job.
[time=1435] 90% felt they were inadequately trained to cope with the demands placed on them by their ministry. 40% reported a serious conflict with a parishioner at least once a month. 70% of pastors do not have someone they consider a close friend.
[time=1455] 37% have been involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with someone in their church. 70% say they have a lower self-image after they've pastored than when they started.
[time=1467] Man, that's bad news.
[time=1471] That's discouraging. And I wonder if some of that isn't due to in part the superstar image of the hyper hyper gifted men that the Lord has graciously given to our country, some of whose names we've listed already this morning, and how the average guy compares himself to that kind of incredibly gifted individual and feels as if he could never meet up, he could never match the standard, and how all those guys are on the radio all the time, and it's very common for his parishioner to be listening to those people on a regular basis, and I think that's wonderful. I thank God for those men, and I have no complaint with that.
[time=1511] Sometimes I wonder if the great level of discouragement in pastors today doesn't come from their misunderstanding of their mission.
[time=1519] They don't have a clear understanding of what God expects them to do, and they try to fulfill everybody's expectations, and of course that's impossible.
[time=1527] That may have been contributing to the discouragement that Timothy was feeling, and that, again as you know, is the reason for which Paul has written the book of 1 Timothy and 2 Timothy, and later the book of Titus, what we call the pastoral epistles.
[time=1539] The passage we have in front of us, these 11 verses verses 6 to 16 are full of imperatives.
[time=1547] That's the way you write a verb in the command form. This is Paul the father of Timothy's faith, giving Timothy command after command, after command, after command. This is what your ministry is all about. This is what it's supposed to look like. This is what you should be pursuing in your ministry. There are 12 imperatives in this passage of only 11 verses. It's as if to say, Timothy against the onslaught of expectations, requests, needs, demands, opportunities, distractions that face you on a daily basis, and are constantly pulling at you.
[time=1583] Here are 12 commands. Here are 12 non-negotiables.
[time=1587] Here are 12 undebatable priorities, indispensable to your ministry that you must pursue and have as a part of your life, as a pastor, and as a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ. If in fact you are to hear the words at the end of your life, well done, thou good and faithful servant. This cuts through the cultural differences, this cuts through the unreasonable expectations. This is it. This is the list.
[time=1611] This is the thing which Paul is saying through the inspiration of the Spirit of God. These are the accounts on which God evaluates whether or not a pastor has done a good service to his people.
[time=1623] This helps him decide between good, better, and best. This sets his priorities. If nothing else is done, these must be done. That almost enters him into a planned neglect.
[time=1639] I know I can't get it all done. I know I'll never meet everybody's expectations.
[time=1643] I know I can't keep everybody happy. But these things I will do, because I know these are what keep my Lord happy.
[time=1651] And if you're joining us this morning, we're coming to this passage first last week, and we returned to it again this week, and we covered the first four points last week. They were these, verse six, and pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus.
[time=1667] The first thing an effective pastor does is he sounds the alarm.
[time=1671] He warns his people against false doctrine and error, even as Paul had done in the previous five verses, these demon doctrines, that he very pointedly and openly confronted in the family of God. Secondly, he saturates himself in the word of God.
[time=1687] You can see that at the end of verse six, he is nourished on the words of faith and of sound doctrine which you have been following. The pursuit of his life is the knowledge of the word of God. He becomes an expert student of Scripture. If he isn't that, he can't point out the errors and he can't nurture the believers into a stronger relationship with God. Thirdly, he separates himself from false doctrine. He separates himself from false doctrine.
[time=1711] Verse seven, "Have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women." That's kind of a sarcastic cultural phrase of the day that is really a demeaning remark about somebody's thoughts.
[time=1723] Your thoughts are nothing more than I would expect from a kind of a senile old lady sitting there just babbling to herself.
[time=1731] He says, "Stay away from false doctrine. Don't open your mind to false doctrine.
[time=1735] Don't study it. Don't pursue it. Don't look into it. Study the truth and when the air shows up you'll immediately know it because it doesn't compare with what you already know.
[time=1743] Don't allow your mind to become a battleground of indecision.
[time=1747] Be deeply convinced of what you know to be the true word of God.
[time=1751] Hold to those convictions and keep yourself away from anything and everything that would make inroads into your assurance of the truth that is presented in the word of God.
[time=1761] Fourthly, it's that he should strive for personal holiness.
[time=1765] In the middle of verse seven, on the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.
[time=1769] For bodily discipline is only of little profit. But godliness is profitable for all things
[time=1775] since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
[time=1779] If you're going to pursue something, if you're going to give yourself wholeheartedly to some endeavor by all means don't let the priority of your life become your physical fitness.
[time=1787] That's important. You need to be in good shape. You need to take care of yourself and evidence is a level of self-discipline in your own life. You shouldn't be completely out of control with respect to your body. But that's not the pursuit because your body is a temporal thing and it really diminishes so quickly.
[time=1803] It only lasts for a little while. Instead, pursue the condition of your soul, the stability and the health and the nurturing of your personal relationship with Jesus Christ. So he sounds the alarm. He saturates himself in the word of god. He separates himself from unholy teaching and he strives after personal holiness. And that brings us to our next point this morning found in verse 10.
[time=1827] He says, "For it is for this we labor and strive because we have fixed our hope on the living God who was the savior of all men especially of believers." He uses very strong language in labor and strive. He's trying to say to Timothy, "The pastorate is the place of hard work, arduous work, long hours, endless commitment to the ministry, limitless commitment to the ministry." Pastors are often and rightly so the brunt of all kinds of jokes that depict them as very lazy people who milk the sheep who do not earn their money because they just kind of show up on Sunday and share some thoughts out of the newspaper that they'd read and make some nice comments about that. And they show up and do the funerals and the weddings and that they're all the parties. They're always available to be there when somebody's handing out food or drinks or whatever it is. And they sometimes are rightly stereotyped as leeches, as people who are just hanging around looking for the handout.
[time=1891] And Paul wants nothing to do with that. That was not what characterized his ministry and that is not what should characterize the ministry of any pastor.
[time=1899] He should be known for his hard work and to communicate the notion he uses the word labor which many times the New Testament is describing the labor you do with your hands. This is a blue-collar word. This is in 1 Corinthians 4.12, "We toil working with our hands." Ephesians 4.28, "Stop stealing and work with your hands so you'll have something to share with the people who are in need." Paul himself worked with his hands. He was a tent maker. Many times he would minister in a certain city by earning his own living and then offering his ministry for free because he didn't want anybody accusing him of being this kind of a freeloader. 2 Timothy 2.26, the hard-working farmer ought to be the first to receive his share of the crops. This is a word that describes manual labor hard work by the sweat of your brow. And though the ministry really at times is remarkably intangible, I mean how do you get somebody to grow? How do you get somebody to accept Jesus?
[time=1959] How do you get somebody to change from a sinful pursuit to a godly pursuit? I mean it's dependent upon their own choice. It's dependent upon the spirit of God in their life.
[time=1967] It's dependent upon other friends. Many times you just wish you had something to grab onto in the ministry. I sometimes feel like when I go home and I've had one of those kinds of days I wish somebody would have just given me a ditch to dig.
[time=1979] So I could say, "See, look, I dug that ditch. See, it's done. It's dug.
[time=1983] They're going to put a pipe in it and fill it over. But I dug that ditch because it can be intangible. It can be elusive. It can be disappointing and people can give the appearance of growth and it's nothing more than hypocrisy or pretense or it's just a short, quick spurt of evangelical fervor and they quickly fall back and you see them two weeks later and they haven't the spark or the commitment or the desire to grow.
[time=2007] And he says, "Timothy, your life, your ministry should be marked by hard work, long hard work." Sometimes I like to be around people that work hard. So I am reminded of just how difficult their task really is.
[time=2023] It's helpful for me to be around people who and sometimes I seek them out because I'll feel a little lazy and I'll feel like, "Wow, what is this all about?
[time=2031] And what am I supposed to do now?" And I get around some people that are really working hard at what they do and it stimulates you back into that pattern of life.
[time=2041] Paul said it very clearly in 1 Thessalonians 2, he said, "Having a fond affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel but our lives as well, also our lives because you had become so dear to us. You recall, brethren, our labor and hardship how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaim to you the gospel of God." So he says, "Timothy, envision yourself working as it were with your hands in your ministry." And though you don't use your hands much but you use your lips and your heart and your concern and your passion for people and you're exhorting them and imploring them and meeting with them and praying with them and studying the Word of God and preaching the Word of God endlessly, and tirelessly. He also uses the Word there, strive. We labor and strive at the beginning of verse 10. And this is a word, an athletic word, that is the word agonidzai or to agonize.
[time=2101] That's where we get our Word in the English to agonize.
[time=2105] It means overcoming opposition. Overcoming opposition like an athlete who has to overcome the opposition or the competition both in people he's competing against and himself, we are to agonize and overcome the obstacles in our path to faithfully pursue our ministry.
[time=2121] You have to overcome yourself and your weaknesses and your sinful tendencies to live a pure godly life of discipline for the cause of Christ. There is the opposition of the culture in which you live and the demonic demons, the demonic doctrines infiltrate your culture and your people's minds and the flock and fill them with all kinds of erroneous notions about how life is to be lived and what is right and what is fair and what is just and what ought to be a whole culture that breeds selfishness and the whole commitment of Christianity is to give your life away. There is the opposition sometimes of the people themselves who will take a dislike to you and become a thorn in your flesh and look for their greatest joy in opposing your point and all the rest and thankful we have very little of that here.
[time=2169] So Paul says that the ministry is a place for hard work and for the striving of overcoming the opposition the ministry is full of it, move through it. Oswald Sanders in his helpful little book on spiritual leadership says it this way. If the pastor is unwilling to pay the price for his leadership it will always be mediocre. True leadership always exacts a heavy toll on the whole man and the more effective the leadership is the higher the price to be paid. It's all consuming, it takes your life it saps it up, it is everything to you, the state of your ministry, your life, your family, your flock.
[time=2209] You say what's the motive? What keeps that going?
[time=2213] Why would a person work that hard? Well look at it at the end of verse 10 because we have fixed our hope on the living God who is the savior of all men.
[time=2225] These pastors have set their heart and affection and hope on the living God. He is not some idol, he's alive, he's real, he is at work in the church today and in the world today there really is going to be an end to this world and that living God will preside at the end of that age and there will be judgment for those who don't accept Christ there will be hell for those who have not repented of their sins there will be life everlasting for those who have embraced the person of Jesus Christ this is real stuff, this is actually going to happen, the end of the age is coming and he's aware of that but he has fixed his hope on the living God and so is willing to labor and strive. And you're aware of his ministry, the apostle Paul had the perfect example in all of this, he labored at the point of exhaustion through the shipwrecks, through the beatings, through the robbings that he had undergone, the attacks from the Jews, the false accusations eventually we believe martyred for the cause of Christ because he had fixed his hope on the living God.
[time=2285] And I want to ask you this morning, as you know if you're involved in any kind of endeavor, whether in full-time Christian ministry or in secular work, you know that these two words go hand in hand if you're going to succeed, if you're going to be a value to your company or if you own your own company, it's full of laboring and striving it's full of working yourself to exhaustion and overcoming the obstacles.
[time=2309] Why do you do it? Yours should be no lesser emotive than the apostle Paul's and the one that he gives Timothy because you've fixed your hope on the living God. This is thinking about why people work hard, a lot of people work hard because they hope to get to the place where they don't have to work hard anymore.
[time=2329] The whole point is not to have to do this anymore, I can hardly wait to stop working hard. I'm waiting for retirement. Others work hard out of sheer survival. The tidal wave of debt is about ready to sink their ship and they can just barely stay a few feet in front of it by working themselves and striving at every turn of the road. Some are addicted to their work, some don't know who they are, if they're not at work, some are completely uncomfortable out of the work environment, it's their whole identity, they're addicted, they're workaholics, they strive and labor. Some work because they feel safe there, when they're actually in the work environment, they know their little role, they know their place, there's a sense of comfort there, they're willing to work hard because that's the only place they can feel safe. Others are trying to prove something, if I could just accomplish this, if I could just earn enough money to buy this house or buy this thing or have this kind of bank account or if I could just reach this level in my company, then I'd be somebody and I'd have the right image or identity. Man, these aren't the motives that drove Paul in the ministry and they shouldn't be the motives that drive you to the workplace. Your motive should be the same as Paul's, as should mine, we should get up in the morning and go to work because we have fixed our hope on the living God and it's at that place, that marketplace, that sphere of influence, that we can have an influence on others who don't know Christ.
[time=2417] The world's motives are retirement and survival and being addicted and finding a safe haven and to prove something, that's not the Christian motive, that's not what we're about and there'll be a remarkable difference in the way you work and the way you are experienced at work.
[time=2435] You'll pursue excellence instead of success and there's a world of difference between those two things, a person who's working for the glory of God pursues excellence and wants to do it the very best he can for the glory of God. A person who isn't working for that just pursues success because that's the end, that's what they want, they want the money or the accomplishment or the fame. People who are working for the glory of God, people who have fixed their hope on the living God work hard but in the process they honor the people in the workplace, they don't run over people, they don't take advantage of people, there's a sensitivity to their spiritual needs. It's a different thing altogether.
[time=2471] So Paul says that the ministry is full of hard work and striving that is driven by a motive that has fixed its hope on the living God. Now there's a little theological point at the end of verse 10 that we want to touch on before we move on and you can see it at the end there, it says the living God is the Savior of all men. God is the Savior of all men, especially of believers. What does that mean? Is God the Savior of all men?
[time=2501] In other words is everybody going to end up in heaven?
[time=2505] Does this whole thing culminate with all the people who have ever been born regardless of race, regardless of religion, ending up somehow, some way up in heaven when everything is said and done?
[time=2517] It's called universalism and it's not true.
[time=2521] It doesn't happen that way. I've talked to people, one person I'm thinking of said, you know, I've traveled all around the world and I've seen all the different religions of the world and I've met the people of the world and I'm convinced that though we have many different names for God and he comes in many different like packages and we approach him in many different ways, it's really all the same God and we all just worship him in different ways but it's all acceptable to him and when this is all said and done we'll all be in heaven together. You know the Bible never teaches that.
[time=2549] The Bible never even gets close to teaching that.
[time=2553] The Bible is so full of warnings about hell and damnation as a literal place with literal suffering, the gnashing of teeth, the fire that has never quenched, the worm that never dies for eternity forever and ever being cast out of the presence of God to suffer absolute complete torment forever.
[time=2573] That is a major, I've told you before Jesus and his earthly ministry spent more time as it's recorded for us in the book of Matthew talking about hell than he did about heaven. He was constantly warning people that if they did not accept Jesus Christ on his terms and in his way and repent of their sin they were going to spend forever in hell. God is not the Savior of all men in the sense that he forgives all men at some point and some way for their sins and wraps them all up into the glorious place of heaven. Jesus said that I am the way the truth and the life no man comes unto the Father but by me. That's not what this verse means.
[time=2617] When you interpret the scriptures you have to interpret it in light of the rest of the scriptures.
[time=2621] Scripture is analogous to itself. It defines itself. It explains itself. And what does it mean?
[time=2629] If it doesn't mean that, what does it mean that the living God is the savior of all men. Well I think it's explained in Matthew 5.45 the word savior can be translated sustainer or provider and it is true to say that God is the sustainer and provider of all life. All men are alive today because they are being sustained and provided for by God.
[time=2653] Matthew 5.45 it says he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good.
[time=2661] And sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. In other words without the son nobody lives and without rain nobody lives. And God is the sustainer and the provider of life for all men.
[time=2673] Acts 17.25 says he gives life to all and breath and all things. Every human being that is alive today is alive today because God is their savior. God is their provider. God is their sustainer. God gives them breath. God gives them life.
[time=2689] God gives them son. God gives them an atmosphere. God gives them food.
[time=2693] God allows their body to function in such a way that that food can be assimilated and helpful to the cause of life.
[time=2701] You can see that boldly illustrated in the old Testament where God is called the savior of Israel and it talks about the whole nation.
[time=2709] I brought you out of Egypt. I brought you through the Red Sea. I brought you to the promised land.
[time=2713] I'm your savior and yet we all know that a vast majority of the nation of Israel were apostate. They had nothing to do with the true and living. God rejected him at every turn of the road and there was instead a small remnant inside the nation of Israel that was truly living in relationship with God. But he calls himself the savior of them all because he provided for them all. It's the same thing here.
[time=2737] If a person does not repent of their sin and respond to the claims of God to receive Christ as their savior, they're simply not saved.
[time=2749] There's no way around it.
[time=2753] So Paul says be diligent in the ministry.
[time=2757] Be committed to hard work and to labor and to strive and to overcome the opposition. He goes on then in verse 11 and says this, prescribe and teach these things.
[time=2769] Prescribed means command. To put someone under obligation.
[time=2777] This is the authoritative tone in which God wants the word of God to be communicated.
[time=2785] That's the proper stance for a preacher. A preacher doesn't come up into the pulpit and share nice thoughts. A preacher doesn't come up into the pulpit if he's going to be approved by God and be known as one who is a faithful servant of Christ Jesus and share suggestions.
[time=2801] He's here to articulate truth and to do that with a command and a feeling of authority.
[time=2809] Bob Vernon tells the story of the LAPD when he was there and one of the criteria that they would evaluate a man as he would apply to be on the police force was did he have a commanding voice, a commanding tone of authority. He says that's very important because it's difficult to walk up behind a criminal and say just take them up.
[time=2829] It doesn't work. Put your hands in the air.
[time=2833] What is needed is a command and a tone and a whole feeling of authority there. It's the same thing in the pulpit. It's the same thing with the word of God. Prescribed and command he says it's the same commanding that the Philippian authorities did when they put Paul and Silas in jail.
[time=2849] When Jesus commanded the unclean spirits to come out of the demoniac he prescribed that. He commanded that to come out.
[time=2857] When Paul was confronted over and over by the little slave girl who was full of a spirit of divination at the city of Philippi he cast the demon out, he commanded the demon out. That's the same word.
[time=2869] Command, prescribe and teach, command and teach, command and teach.
[time=2873] Put people under obligation to obey the word of God and let them know if they don't they will suffer consequences for not doing that.
[time=2881] That's the whole purpose of a worship service. It's for us to come and worship God.
[time=2885] That's what we do on Sunday mornings. We worship God through the truth in our hymns and we worship God through our giving and when the word of God is taught and preached and prescribed and commanded and declared it is for the purpose of our putting our will and submission to the will of God to bow down in worship before God. Acts 1730 says God is now declaring or prescribing or commanding same word and that all everywhere should repent. That's interesting isn't it?
[time=2913] You think of God wishing in one passage for all men to come to salvation but in Acts 17 he says I command you. I command you to repent.
[time=2921] Salvation is really an issue of obedience to the command of God.
[time=2925] Not suggesting, not a good idea, not one of several viable options. Commanding.
[time=2933] What does it require of a man to do that, to preach with authority? Four things.
[time=2941] One, he must believe the Bible is God's Word. If you don't believe this is the inerrant word of God you won't preach it with authority. Secondly, you have to be taught and trained as to how to understand the God's Word. There has to be a certainty, a conviction in your own heart and life that your understanding of that text is the accurate one that you know what it says. Thirdly, you must be committed to communicating that, the notion of preaching. That this is in fact the way that God would have the flock be fed through this medium of preaching and fourthly that they're hungry. That there is a need in the heart and soul of man both saved and unsaved to hear the preaching of the word of God.
[time=2977] If you don't have any one of those you're a weak preacher. If you don't believe the Bible is the word of God, if you don't believe you know what the Bible says, if you don't believe the preaching is the way to say it and if you don't believe that people have a need to hear you say it, you're a weak preacher because you've got nothing to say. You'll lack conviction.
[time=2993] Now again, this is not abusive preaching. This is not to be a brow beating preaching.
[time=2997] This is not to be harsh or demeaning or demanding in some way that it would be unreasonable outside the scope of Scripture. But it is clear that Paul is saying prescribe and teach put people under obligation to obey the Word of God.
[time=3013] So an excellent servant, one, sounds the alarm. He saturates himself and the Word of God. He separates himself from false doctrine. He strives after godliness. He serves with diligence and he preaches with authority. Now this last one for this morning, verse 12. This is a hard one for me. I've failed at it often. Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity show yourself an example to those who believe. They were looking down on him.
[time=3049] He was young. The Word here, as it's used in the Greek, describes a person who is 40 years of age or younger. If you were 40 or younger, you were considered young. If you're 40 or older, you're considered wise.
[time=3065] Matur, skilled, old.
[time=3073] Timothy was probably about 38, maybe 39.
[time=3077] He was a young man. They were older men in the assembly.
[time=3081] They were bringing a false doctrine. They were wanting to discredit him. And because they can't attack the Word of God itself, they decided to attack him. And they did it by his youthfulness.
[time=3089] And that really is a great way to attack somebody, especially if he's in ministry and he's young.
[time=3093] I remember coming on staff at Grace Community Church at the tender little age of 21, was later given the responsibility of all the student life at the master's college at 26.
[time=3109] I was young. I still am young. But I had youthful behavior to boot.
[time=3115] It was a painful process to try to unlearn some of that stuff.
[time=3119] My brother-in-law, Alan, and I have one of those special relationships.
[time=3123] I never had an older brother and he dated my sister since she was about 15.
[time=3127] I was about whatever, 12. And so he's like a brother.
[time=3131] "Best man in my wedding." And we developed this kind of unique relationship around the theme of the Pink Panther movies. Remember that? Inspector Cruzo and his little yellow-skinned friend, Keto. He was kind of his servant.
[time=3143] Keto was the inspector servant. And Keto would hide in the closet or in the refrigerator or on the roof and wait for the inspector to come home.
[time=3151] And then he would leap from the closet and attack him. And that's the kind of relationship Alan and I had.
[time=3156] I was bringing it to a grand finality. I'd really pulled off some really good attacks so far.
[time=3160] But this was going to be my best.
[time=3163] I got a buddy by the name of Drew, who was a first-year student there at the college.
[time=3167] And I said, "Would you mind helping me?" My wife and my sister and brother-in-law are going away a couple of hours from here to a little place for a couple of days.
[time=3175] It's kind of a condominium situation. And I told him how I was trying to pull this off.
[time=3180] I said, "Would you mind?" This is hard for me to say even today that I actually thought of this.
[time=3184] But I said, "Would you mind showing up about 8 o'clock on Friday night and wearing a mask? And I'll give you one of my handguns."
[time=3194] And I heard that, "Oh my God. I know, I'm using this as a negative illustration."
[time=3200] I said, "You can bring one of my handguns and we'll put blanks in it." And I'll make sure the door of the condominium is open. All four of us will be in there.
[time=3209] And you storm the place and hold us up.
[time=3212] At gunpoint. And when you've got everything, then at the end I'll make a lunge.
[time=3218] Like I'm trying to be the protector. And you shoot me with the blank.
[time=3223] And I'll have blood right here. You know what I mean? Catch up. And I'll pop it.
[time=3228] And you disappear and I'll lay there like I'm dead.
[time=3232] It sounded really good in my office. It sounded really good to me. It sounded really good to Drew.
[time=3238] Drew went home that night and told his mom and dad his excitement about this plan that Pastor Russ had come up with.
[time=3246] Just so happens that Drew's mom is John MacArthur's sister.
[time=3253] The man I worked for. The next day I got a phone call to come in to the President's office.
[time=3261] And they'll look on his face. You know, are you nuts? What are you doing? Don't you think?
[time=3269] This is a little youthful. He said, "What happens if one of the people in your family who you love in this whole process has a heart attack as they watch you getting what they think shot?"
[time=3279] And worse yet, what happens if somebody in the next room hears what's going on and calls the police?
[time=3286] And then Drew gets shot for real.
[time=3290] And I said, "Oh, oh, oh, yeah. That's a really good point, John." I guess that'd be pretty stupid, huh?
[time=3298] I said, "Hi. I guess you're thinking how to just like forget that whole plan." Yeah. Okay. Sorry, Chief. See ya.
[time=3305] And you know, you lose respect. You lose respect.
[time=3308] I lost respect that day. In his eyes, I lost some respect in Drew's parents' eyes.
[time=3313] And I think by the time I was done, I lost some respect in Drew's eyes.
[time=3316] Shouldn't have been thinking those things. Should have been planning those things.
[time=3319] Youthful behavior doesn't belong in the ministry.
[time=3323] He says, "In other words, it's okay to be young. What's not okay is to be characteristic of youthful, undeserving behavior that discredits you and your ministry."
[time=3333] Well, in what areas? Well, look, he gives five areas. In your speech, your speech is what comes out of what fills your heart.
[time=3340] It is the best indicator of what's really inside of you. Let your speech be seasoned with grace.
[time=3346] Your conduct, really lifestyle, let it invade every area of your life.
[time=3351] What you do on vacation when you're away from the church, what you do at home, what you do wherever you go.
[time=3356] Let this kind of mature, godly behavior characterize your conduct.
[time=3362] James 3.13 says, "Who among you is wise in understanding?
[time=3366] You're making a boast towards being wise in understanding? Let him show this by his good behavior, his deeds and the gentleness of wisdom."
[time=3374] In other words, if you're making a claim to wisdom, live it. Show it out.
[time=3378] And then in love, and the word love here is not a spiritual goose bump and all those kinds of things.
[time=3383] This is talking about self-sacrificial service for the flock.
[time=3387] Lay your life down for your friends.
[time=3390] Consistently give up your rights, give up your sense of your own priorities, and be totally committed to them and to your ministry.
[time=3398] We've been sharing with you music from our Sanctuary Choir celebration and soloist Denise Mitchell.

[time=3423] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's bow and pray this prayer together.
[time=3431] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3437] And I know today that I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3441] I ask you to come into my heart and be my Savior today.
[time=3445] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3449] I hope you prayed that prayer today. And if you did, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
