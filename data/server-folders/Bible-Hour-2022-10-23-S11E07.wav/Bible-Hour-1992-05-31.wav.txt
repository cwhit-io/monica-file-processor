[time=0] A pastor is about ready to defect from the ministry.
[time=6] His name is Tim.
[time=7] We don't know his last name.
[time=8] He was pastoring in one of the larger cities of the area.
[time=12] He's faced tremendous discouragement.
[time=13] He's tired and he wants out of the ministry.
[time=15] He's being allured by the things of the material world and he's being drawn to what they call
[time=22] youthful lusts and he's considering an affair.
[time=25] But he receives a letter in the mail, a letter from the man who brought him to Christ, a letter from the man who put him into the ministry, humanly speaking.
[time=35] Today we're going to look at what the letter said.
[time=43] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=54] you will find to be in encouragement.
[time=56] Thank you for joining us.
[time=59] Young pastor Tim, does he remind you of anyone you know?
[time=62] He was discouraged, ready to abandon his calling to the ministry.
[time=66] Then he received a letter from the man who had been responsible for leading him to the Lord, a letter which challenged him to keep on keeping on.
[time=73] Join with us today as Pastor Moore presents the third in the series of messages he's called Qualifications of an Excellent Pastor.
[time=80] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy.
[time=85] We'll be looking in at chapter 4 verses 6 through 16.
[time=90] Today's special music recognizes students of the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=94] Just before Pastor Russ's message, BCS senior Lori Scheiman will be singing the song Legacy.
[time=101] As we begin our service today, let's join our sanctuary choir as they present wonderful merciful Savior, featured with the choir will be vocalist Lori Scheiman and BCS student Rachel
[time=111] McIntosh on the fluke.
[time=141] Thank you.
[time=171] [MUSIC]
[time=201] Oh, we hope this leave us away.
[time=210] You are the one that we praise.
[time=218] You are the one we adore.
[time=225] You give the healing and praise.
[time=231] [MUSIC]
[time=256] All my deep, perfect Father.
[time=263] Faithfully loving your own.
[time=270] Here in our weakness you find us.
[time=277] Calling before your throne.
[time=283] You are the one that we praise.
[time=299] You are the one we adore.
[time=305] You give the healing and praise.
[time=314] You are the one that we adore.
[time=342] You give the healing our hearts always wonderful.
[time=351] Oh, our hearts always wonderful.
[time=363] [MUSIC]
[time=382] Right now we take a break from our worship service and tell you how thankful we are that you watch the Bible hour regularly.
[time=388] When you write in that's a great encouragement to our pastor and me and we are thankful that that's one of the means that we know that you are faithfully watching the Bible hour.
[time=397] This is a very special day in the lives of the seniors of Black Hawk Christian School. Let's take a look.
[time=406] Tonight we will observe the 12th annual commencement exercises of the Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=412] The school started in 1973 provides a positive and successful learning environment for its 416 students.
[time=421] As the school model states there is academic excellence on a biblical foundation.
[time=429] Teachers and administrators strive to develop the total child and to encourage maximum learning in each phase of their growth process.
[time=438] I've been involved with Black Hawk Christian School and been a friend of the school administrator for a number of years.
[time=444] I'd like to welcome him right now to the studio Steve. It's nice to have you here.
[time=449] Tell us a little bit about some of the final activities for this year 1992.
[time=454] It's been a great finish for our school year this year.
[time=457] We had chapel on Friday. That wasn't the strongest finish we've ever had because I forgot the text that I was going to speak on in chapel.
[time=465] I got so emotional wrapped up in the last chapel and looking at our seniors as they're ready to graduate that I honestly couldn't remember the book I was supposed to speak from.
[time=473] That hasn't happened all the time I'm thankful for that but at least that time they know I'm just as human as they are make many mistakes.
[time=480] I'm pleased today to have two fine young people with us.
[time=484] They're seniors that have come from Michigan. Sean came in the 5th grade and has been in our school since then
[time=491] and Sean Neff is the son of Paul and Donna Neff.
[time=494] Tabby Berry who came here in the 6th grade is the daughter of Wallace and Sherry Berry
[time=501] and Tabby and Sean both coming from Michigan hadn't been involved in our school at all
[time=507] but Sean had been in Christian school.
[time=509] Sean you know learning hasn't been easy for you has it.
[time=512] No sir.
[time=513] Tell us a little bit about what it was like when you first went to school.
[time=517] Well when I was first went to school it was kind of it was alright and then once I got in the first grade it was my reading
[time=525] I had a problem reading and my disability in it and so then it was make it harder for me to understand the stuff that I had to do in reading
[time=534] and which in school you have to read a lot.
[time=536] You sure do you know but the truth of it is Sean you overcame that reading disability and it was really difficult for you
[time=543] and all through the 13 years K through 12 you have to read a lot but with your parents help and with teachers that loved you
[time=551] and tutoring and most of all your hard work now you're graduating and I'm really proud of you.
[time=556] I picked you specifically for that reason to be on this program because I'm so proud that you worked so hard plus you're a godly young man and I'm thankful for that.
[time=565] Tabby when you first came to Black Hawk Christian were you excited about coming to a Christian school?
[time=569] No, not at all.
[time=573] When I found out when I found out I had a word dress I was definitely not excited because I come from a public school
[time=579] kindergarten through sixth grade and you know jeans shorts and just the dress code here really blew me away
[time=586] so I was not looking forward to it at all but first day of school it was a little different the kids were really different
[time=593] at a public school I'm just really used to the different language there versus a Christian school so that was really different to see
[time=601] but everyone was very accepting and very loving and so I grew to like it and now I would give anything to wear a dress just to go to Black Hawk.
[time=610] Oh that's great to hear. Well I'm not going to wear a dress to go to school but I'm sure thankful that you both were here
[time=616] and Tabby was our homecoming queen. Our students appreciated her so much that they elected her homecoming queen this year
[time=622] and that's a great honor. Sean's respected by all the students too. What I see in them is a teachable heart and a servant's attitude.
[time=630] They both have that. God bless you. You're wonderful. I'm proud of you.
[time=636] Steve we're really thankful for the Christian school and glad to have Sean and Tabby representing them today.
[time=642] This will be a great day in the lives of all those seniors and we wish them all well.
[time=646] As I've said in the last couple weeks if you're interested in Christian education you might want to call the Christian school office at 4937400
[time=656] and get more information about how you can enroll your students in Black Hawk Christian school. We'd love to hear from you.
[time=662] Just a couple exciting events that are taking place throughout the summer one in which is the summer celebration.
[time=668] That takes place every Wednesday night at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 7 p.m.
[time=673] There are a variety of speakers that will be with us. We'll have some excellent films.
[time=678] If you're free on Wednesday nights all through the summer come and join us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church 7 p.m. each Wednesday evening.
[time=686] Then we always look forward at this time of the year for the annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=691] That'll be on Sunday afternoon June 28th at 4 p.m. We're calling it Celebrate America and on the following TV programs we'll be telling you a little bit more about the content of that program.
[time=702] But put it on your calendar for Sunday June 28th the annual Patriotic Panorama right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church Celebrate America.
[time=712] And then a number of you have written in for the Bible character cards. I've talked about them and I read five letters last Friday that talked about ordering the cards.
[time=723] There are 72 pictures of Bible characters and a little biographical sketch on each one and a verse.
[time=730] And this can be an excellent tool to use with your children or grandchildren this summer.
[time=734] So if you'd like to receive a set of these character cards just right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=746] Once again the address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=756] March meet our secretary tells us that we're temporarily out of stock but we've ordered more and we'll get them to you just as soon as we can.
[time=765] We go back now to the live portion of our service with the message from our pastor Russell Moore.
[time=770] Just before he speaks we have Lori Scheimen that'll be singing for us.
[time=774] Lori is a senior at Black Hawk Christian School and I'm sure she's going to bless your heart as she sings.
[time=779] Once again thank you Mr. Longbreak and Sean and Tabby for joining us today. Let's go back to our regular service right now.
[time=809] Do I have to ask myself who I really am?
[time=818] It's easy just to wear a smile and hope that maybe I can hide.
[time=829] The struggles in me love has to make a choice following one voice that our hearts long to hear.
[time=848] Just to know that everything we've done, every word we've said, every song we've sung in this world where truth is hard to find.
[time=870] All we have to offer is the legacy we've become.
[time=894] Children see us as we are not a distant star in their eyes.
[time=905] There's no pretending their lives are waiting to discern all that they can learn from us.
[time=919] And who we've trusted love has to make a choice following one voice that our hearts long to hear.
[time=937] Just to know that everything we've done, every word we've said, every song we've sung in this world where truth is hard to find.
[time=959] All we have to offer is the legacy we've become.
[time=971] We want you to find us living what is true, Lord, remind us of who we are in you.
[time=990] Just to know that everything we've done, every word we've said, every song we've sung in this world where truth is hard to find.
[time=1012] All we have to offer is the legacy we've become.
[time=1042] Thank you, Lord.
[time=1047] As Lord was singing that song, I realized what a legacy she does leave behind as a graduating senior in our Christian school.
[time=1055] She has been a young lady marvelously used to the Lord to give leadership by her example, her attitude with parents and with teachers and administration, her commitment to study, her involvement in so many of the different aspects of the school.
[time=1071] It's interesting how each one of us is leaving a legacy of some kind or another, and that is highlighted for us as we reach certain points in our life.
[time=1081] And it's really a fitting song to bring us to our text this morning because the Apostle Paul is very, very concerned about his legacy.
[time=1090] If you have your Bibles, let's go to 1 Timothy, chapter 4, and we're looking at a passage of Scripture verses 6 to 16, which really give this man's heart, the Apostle Paul's heart of concern for the legacy that he leaves behind, and what he calls his true child of the faith, Timothy.
[time=1111] Paul is a man as I continue to study this book and understand the Word of God and gain insight into his life.
[time=1119] My respect for the Apostle Paul only goes up with the passing of each day.
[time=1124] And particularly in this setting, Paul is convinced of the reality of hell.
[time=1131] Paul is convinced of the reality of eternal separation from Christ and cognizant torment for all people who do not come to the true faith and knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[time=1146] Paul is equally persuaded that there is a heaven, there is life after death, and it's not some vague, undefined thing. It is the presence of the living God.
[time=1155] It is the place where there will be no more tears and no more pain and no more sorrow and no more death.
[time=1162] And Paul is equally convinced that the only way to get to heaven is through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1170] And it is these deep, profound, yet simple convictions that drive this man to a level of concern for people he has never met before, people he may never meet.
[time=1183] But because he is aware of these realities, he is driven in his heart and his life and in his mind to act in their best interest.
[time=1192] And I want to go back for a minute this morning to Acts chapter 19 and remind ourselves of the way in which the Spirit of God is using this life, this one simple life to leave a spiritual legacy that transcends anything I'm sure he ever could have dreamed of.
[time=1212] After having met the Lord personally on the Damascus road at his conversion, the Apostle Paul was shortly thereafter led off into the Arabian desert where he stayed some three years and received visions from Christ himself.
[time=1226] Visions and truth, visions of doctrine, visions of the mystery that both Jew and Gentile can be in the body of Jesus Christ together united through faith.
[time=1236] It's these visions out of which he writes the letters of the New Testament and he is full of doctrine and truth that had never been known before in the history of mankind.
[time=1249] And the Spirit of God takes this man to a city called Ephesus and the city is absolutely completely dominated by Satan. Satan has a stronghold there that is leaving the people in shatters.
[time=1264] Their life has been shattered and they are tormented by the reality of a fallen life and a fallen world with no hope.
[time=1271] And when they embrace the pain of their life and they are aware of how hard their life is and how unfulfilling their life is and how difficult life is and they look for some kind of hope by which to elevate their condition of life.
[time=1284] They see probably in the center of their city this gorgeous gargantuan edifice, remembered as one of the seventh wonders of the world, the temple Diana or the temple Artemis and it is decorated with ornaments beyond your wildest dreams.
[time=1303] And it is here that people are saying you can find life.
[time=1306] It is in that temple that you can find some way to live your life with meaning and with purpose.
[time=1312] And so the discouraged people of the city go there and instead of finding God and instead of finding the message of forgiveness and instead of finding true freedom from sin through the power of Christ they are deeper enslaved and entrenched in their own passions and sin.
[time=1328] For it is there in the temple Diana that worship has been polluted and degraded to the place of sexual contact.
[time=1337] The priests and priestesses of the temple are nothing more than prostitutes and men and women alike in search for some direction in their life would go there, pay money and literally involve themselves in sexual contact with one of these prostitutes.
[time=1355] They would leave as discouraged or more discouraged as they had come, they would have no answers, they would have no direction, they would have no sense of purpose, just more delusionment, just deeper entrenched in sin, just deeper entrenched in the demonic plot to take these people to a Christless eternity.
[time=1374] But to that city God brought a man by the name of the Apostle Paul.
[time=1381] Verse 8 He entered the synagogue and continued speaking out boldly for three months reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.
[time=1390] But when some were becoming hardened and disobedient speaking evil of the way, that's another way to speak about knowing Christ as your Savior.
[time=1398] Before the multitude he withdrew from them and took away the disciples reasoning daily in the school of Terenas.
[time=1404] And this took place for two years, he'd go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth.
[time=1408] So that all who lived in Asia heard the word of the Lord both Jews and Greeks.
[time=1414] Verse 11 And God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hand of Paul.
[time=1420] In other words, God was so committed and concerned that these lost and desperate people in the city of Ephesus not only hear the words that Paul would speak, but would have reason to believe them.
[time=1431] God authenticated the words of the Apostle Paul by extraordinary miracles.
[time=1437] So that the people would have no choice but to draw the obvious conclusion that this man speaks from God.
[time=1445] Verse 12 So that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out.
[time=1454] Marvelous healing power.
[time=1458] Not so that the people could get well, that was really a means to a greater end.
[time=1463] The greater end was so that Paul's words of the true faith in Jesus Christ could be authenticated and have reason to be believed in by these people who had been so darkened in their understanding
[time=1474] by the God of this age and their worship of this false God in the temple Diana.
[time=1483] Verse 17 This became known to all both Jews and Greeks.
[time=1487] There's the mystery of the church who lived in Ephesus and fear fell upon them all.
[time=1492] And the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified.
[time=1496] Many also of those who had believed kept coming confessing and disclosing their practices.
[time=1503] They were openly admitting to their sinful demonic shame and disclosing the manner in which they had practiced this.
[time=1510] Many of those in verse 19 who practiced magic brought their books together and began burning them in the sight of all.
[time=1516] And they counted up the price of them and found at 50,000 pieces of silver.
[time=1520] This is a marvelous outpouring of the ministry of the Spirit of God through a man who genuinely loves these people, cares about these people, is concerned that they not spin forever now.
[time=1531] Verse 20 The word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.
[time=1536] I like that.
[time=1537] The word of the Lord was growing mightily and prevailing.
[time=1544] But behind the scenes in the demonic realm and the spiritual realm, the Ephesians 6 realm powers and principalities of the power of the air.
[time=1552] There is great concern over the fact that people are leaving and forsaking the works-oriented salvation and just the all-out wholesale commitment to sin and are turning to find life in Christ.
[time=1564] It aggravates them.
[time=1566] It just destroys their sense of well-being.
[time=1569] They exist for the absolute opposite reason, these demons.
[time=1573] And Satan himself.
[time=1575] So in verse 23 about that time there arose no small disturbance concerning the way.
[time=1581] For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, was bringing no little business to the craftsmen.
[time=1588] These men he gathered together and with the workmen of similar trades and said, "Men, you know that our prosperity depends upon this business.
[time=1598] We have families, we have homes, we have investments, we have a good living on this thing called the temple Diana or the temple Artemis.
[time=1606] And you see in here, verse 26, that not only an Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia.
[time=1612] This Paul has persuaded and turned away a considerable number of people saying that gods made with hands are no gods at all.
[time=1621] He's saying not only do we have the interest of our own city and the people who buy from us here, but all those in the broader region of Asia who come regularly to Ephesus to participate in this type of worship.
[time=1633] They will no longer buy our little shrines and take them back and we will lose our standard of living."
[time=1640] Then he tries to add some noble part to it, verse 27, and not only is there danger that this trait of ours fallen to disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be regarded as worthless and that she whom all of Asia and the world worship should even be dethroned from her magnificence.
[time=1659] So this clever Demetrius tries to add some sense of nobility to raise it above the crass level of their own sustenance, their own profit, their own money-making endeavor, and he tries to say this is something significant.
[time=1671] We need to protect this not only for our sake, but for the world's sake.
[time=1677] Verse 28, "And when they heard this they were filled with rage. They began crying out saying great as Artemis of the Ephesians, and the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus and Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia."
[time=1695] Verse 32, "So then some were shouting one thing, and some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and now watch, and the majority did not know for what cause they had come together."
[time=1709] That was true even when they were in peaceful worship at the temple Diana. The people were confused, the people were lost, the people were without the knowledge of Christ, and it burdened Paul's heart, it broke his heart.
[time=1722] And so he preached, and he preached well, and God confirmed it with extraordinary miracles.
[time=1731] Well that thing quieted down, but Paul had to leave the city, and on a short return visit, you'll notice in chapter 20 verse 17, "He still has the burden of the people of Ephesus on his heart, not just the people who came to know Christ, but the masses out there that were just being led along like sheep to the slaughter
[time=1750] by this demonic scheme and plan." And so from my lead us in verse 17, he sent the Ephesus, and he called the elders of the church. He called the men who were leading the church, and he reviewed his ministry with them.
[time=1764] And he says in verse 22, "I've got to go to Jerusalem, I'm bound to go there by the Spirit who leads me, I must leave."
[time=1773] But verse 21, he says, "Remember that I was solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=1783] That's our message, that's why we exist. That's our purpose. We are the ones, he says, "You elders, you are the men through the message that I gave you from Christ himself. It is we who would testify.
[time=1797] Without distinction of race, color, or creed, there are repentance towards God to turn from sin and embrace the person of Jesus Christ in faith and then live."
[time=1808] But verse 28, "Be on guard for yourselves, for all the flock, be on guard for even yourselves and your flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood."
[time=1822] I know that after my departure, savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.
[time=1830] And from among your own selves, people from within the church, men will arise speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after them into apostasy, to tear them away from their confession of faith and their embracing of the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1846] Satan is relentless, and he will use these men he describes as savage wolves.
[time=1854] And they will come in sheep's clothing, Matthew, Jesus says in Matthew 5 through 7 on the Sermon on the Mount, they will come dressed like shepherds.
[time=1863] Shepherds are the ones who wear sheep's clothing, shepherds are the ones who take the wool and weave it into a garment, it's really sheep's clothing, and they come looking like a shepherd, they come pronouncing health.
[time=1873] They come pronouncing health, they come pronouncing goodwill, they come saying I'm here to help you, but inwardly they are savage wolves and they would ravage the flock, they would rip them from their embracing Christ.
[time=1884] And they would so distort the gospel that though it be preached as a now religion, though they talk about Christ, and though there is a place called the church, the true repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ has been stripped out from it.
[time=1898] And so now Satan then in his mind would have ethicists back under his complete domination.
[time=1904] Because then when the people are hurting and the people are struggling and the people are looking for answers and the people are trying to find some meaning to their life, there is choice one.
[time=1912] I could go back to the temple Diana and he owns that and that is a vehicle by which he sends them to hell.
[time=1918] But if he could just pervert the gospel of enough, if he could just change the mission of the church slightly and rob from it its vitality and truth in the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=1927] then when those hurting souls of emphasis say no to the obvious cult of Satan and move towards the church of God, they will find nothing there either.
[time=1937] And the church itself becomes a vehicle for their entrance into eternal damnation because the gospel has been taken from it.
[time=1945] In order to do that, in the first Timothy chapter 4, the Spirit warns us that these deceitful spirits, these seducing demons will propagate their doctrine demons.
[time=1959] But they'll do it through a human agency, these savage wolves, and these men are known in verse 2 as hypocritical liars.
[time=1966] Men who are too faced, men who have pretense, men who look like they'll help you, but they'd rather hurt you.
[time=1972] And they hurt you because and without disturbance in their own mind because their conscience has been seared as with a branding iron.
[time=1980] And they have a false demon doctrine. They forbid marriage and they forbid foods, abstinence.
[time=1986] You say what's wrong with abstinence? Well in and of itself nothing is wrong with abstinence for a short period of time in any particular endeavor.
[time=1992] But when it is presented as the way to work your way to salvation, when it is presented as the way to heaven, when it is presented as getting right with God by abstaining from food and abstaining from marriage,
[time=2001] it is nothing more than a works-oriented religion which sends people to hell.
[time=2005] It's very clever. It's very deceptive. It's very subtle.
[time=2009] And that is how Satan is trying to twist and distort the church so that it will no longer offer the knowledge of Christ.
[time=2021] The condition is serious. And Paul's heart for people. Paul's being compelled by the love of Christ drives him to send his own disciple, Timothy, to that place, to that city of Ephesus.
[time=2034] Timothy, a man who embraced Christ through the testimony of his mother and his grandmother, who grew up in the faith, who walks with God, who has been seen and evidenced by the church as gifted for his ministry,
[time=2046] who is held in high esteem among the people of God. Paul calls him the one after his own heart, the one man that he knows of that really has this passion for the cause of Christ, burning in his breast.
[time=2057] Now about thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-nine years of age, he sends Timothy because he's not free himself to go, and in a matter of a short period of time, Timothy is preparing to defect from the ministry.
[time=2071] Timothy is overwhelmed by the opposition. Timothy is overwhelmed by the cleverness and the prowess and the strength of these false prophets who are probably elders in some of the churches who are his own elders, older than he is.
[time=2083] They may be more gifted with their tongue and more eloquent and able to speak and articulate these myths and these endless genealogies which mad add up to mere speculation, and it may be that the people are receptive to that message in a way that they weren't before.
[time=2097] Timothy is tired, he is questioning whether or not God even called him in the ministry in the first place. He's wondering if God gave him enough of spiritual gift to do the ministry.
[time=2105] He's being tempted and seduced by the things of the world. First Timothy's six indicates a real interest on his part in material things and money and the love of money.
[time=2114] Suggesting that he'd said to himself, "This ministry isn't worth it, I'd rather just opt out for the things of the world and enjoy the life of these and comfort that I see around me."
[time=2123] Second Timothy warns him, Paul warns him in Second Timothy to flee youthful lusts and from that we can gather that he was being tempted also to opt out of the ministry not just for materialism but also for the passing pleasures of sin for a season to indulge in the sensuality which so characterized the city and would have been so plentiful and available to him.
[time=2148] Desperate straits, desperate situation, two men, two men standing unabashed for the cause of Christ amidst a wicked and ungodly generation.
[time=2163] They're there for no other purpose than the cause of Christ, they want nothing in return, just the welfare and the benefit of other people.
[time=2171] But Satan is a strong adversary. And so to help his young disciple in the faith he writes this letter First Timothy and particularly these eleven verses in six through sixteen powerful verses, intimate verses, verses that the senior pastor says of the associate pastor verses that the disciple says to the disciple E.
[time=2199] We've been looking at them for the last two weeks and this will be our last week to consider what Paul says to the pastor. If you want to be in verse six, a good servant of Jesus Christ, Timothy.
[time=2209] If you want to finish the course that you've sat, if you want to hear well done, thou good and faithful servant at the end of all of this, these are the things, these are the twelve imperatives that the Greek reveals to us, these are the twelve commands that I'm giving you, these must characterize your ministry, these must be the priorities.
[time=2228] If these aren't what mark your ministry, then you're not a good servant of Jesus Christ. And what he says to Timothy, Paul says to me and to every other pastor that would ever serve in that capacity.
[time=2242] We've seen seven of them so far. The first is in verse six and pointing out these things of the brother and that refers back to verses one through five, the demon doctrines.
[time=2252] We've said it this way, an effective pastor sounds the alarm, sounds the alarm against false doctrines. Secondly, he saturates himself in the word of God, he's nourished verse six on the words of faith and of sound doctrine, constantly nourished on those things.
[time=2268] Thirdly, he separates himself from false doctrine. Verse seven, have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. Do not allow your mind to become a battleground of indecision, don't fill your mind with all the questions and the doubts about God, about Christ, don't even expose yourself to that, you have the truth, it is the truth, and allow your conviction to fire hotter every day.
[time=2291] Number four, an effective pastor strives for personal godliness. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness at the end of verse seven.
[time=2300] Then verse eight, bodily discipline is of only little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things since it holds the promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
[time=2310] There's a place to be physically fit, but the priority of emphasis in striving in your life should be for the fitness of your soul before your God.
[time=2318] Timothy, pursue that with a vengeance. Verse ten, the effective pastor serves with diligence, for it is for this we labor and strive, labor means to work to the point of exhaustion, strive, aga nidzo, to overcome opposition.
[time=2332] Timothy, your life, your ministry is going to be one long series of overcoming opposition after the next and you're going to have to work hard and endlessly and tirelessly at overcoming it.
[time=2344] Serves with diligence. Number six, he speaks with authority. At a verse eleven, the word prescribed means to command, it means to give an order, it means to put the people under obligation to obey the word of God.
[time=2355] Don't share little thoughts, don't share personal opinions, oblige the people to come under the authority of the word of God.
[time=2365] And then lastly in review, he sets a godly example in verse twelve, let no one look down on your youthfulness. Don't let the fact that you're not yet forty or over be the discrediting factor in your life.
[time=2377] Instead, let your behavior prove your worthiness for ministry, your speech, your conduct, your love, your faith and your purity show yourself an example, a two-poss, a pattern that can be laid down and then marked out and then cut out as the proper shape to be modeled.
[time=2393] Be an example. So he sounds the alarm, he saturates himself in the word of God, he separates himself from false doctrine, he strives for personal godliness, he serves with diligence, he speaks with authority, he sets a godly example.
[time=2408] And now this morning, number eight, he states the truth. Look at it in verse thirteen, he states the truth. Paul says until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhortation and teaching.
[time=2424] The effective pastor has a thoroughly biblical ministry, it revolves and centers and focuses on the word of God.
[time=2432] Now this public reading, what is that? Some of you have been to churches and you've heard the public reading of scripture.
[time=2439] And at some point in the service, somebody gets up and opens a Bible or sometimes that very passage is printed in your bulletin and you read it back and forth or it's read to you.
[time=2451] And then the preacher comes up and starts to speak but you are immediately aware of the fact over and over and over again week after week, month after month, year after year, that what the pastor has to say is completely unrelated to the scripture that was read.
[time=2466] Some call that the public reading of scripture. That is not at all what Paul has in mind.
[time=2473] It is popular in some churches today to have the public reading of scripture and then the pastor gets up and gives a bunch of truisms off the golden rule.
[time=2480] We've got to be nice to each other and tell stories about the little girl and her mother or the little boy and his dog or the political commentary on the newspaper that week and it's just his opinion and it's or the lack of his opinion about anything definitive.
[time=2492] And you leave saying what in the world did he say, was I supposed to come away with a spiritual goose bump, was it supposed to be some good feeling and that is what the church is all about.
[time=2503] Sometimes I'm embarrassed to tell people because of this often correct stigma about preachers.
[time=2510] I'm often hasn't to say I'm a preacher because I'm afraid in their mind they envision me standing up and sharing a bunch of general little thoughts or truisms about being nice to each other.
[time=2521] I don't want to be grouped in that category. I detest that.
[time=2525] I want to be as far away from that as I can possibly be. Why? Because that's not what the word of God calls me to do.
[time=2532] It's a definite article in the Greek. It's the reading. It's the reading. Public is added. It's not in there in the Greek.
[time=2539] Until I come, give attention to the reading. What is the reading?
[time=2543] The reading is the presentation of the scriptures and then an exposition of what has just been read in order to make what has just been read clear and obvious and plain and applicable.
[time=2554] It comes to us from Nehemiah chapter 8 verse 8. The people have returned from their Babylonian exile.
[time=2561] They're now in the process of trying to rebuild the wall and eventually the city and the temple so that their religion can continue as God had intended it to do and they face opposition after opposition.
[time=2571] Finally they asked Ezra to describe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had given to Israel.
[time=2577] And Ezra the scribe stood at a wooden podium which they had made for that purpose and beside him some attendance stood about 13 and all.
[time=2586] Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up.
[time=2594] And they read from the book from the law of God translating it to give the sense so that they understood the reading.
[time=2603] The translating was in part moving it from Hebrew to Aramaic because the people returning from their Babylonian captivity had lost their facility in the Hebrew language and therefore it needed to be translated into their own language from Hebrew into Aramaic.
[time=2615] But it goes much beyond the simple translation.
[time=2617] It is to give the sense of it so that they understood the reading.
[time=2621] The word understood describes knowing something to the level of profiting from that.
[time=2627] Give them enough that they can profit from it so that it will change the way they are living.
[time=2633] The same word in Psalm 119, 34, give me understanding that I may observe the law and keep it with all my heart.
[time=2640] It is the understanding spoken of in Proverbs that describes the fear of the Lord and the understanding of true righteousness.
[time=2648] True righteousness, my son, if you will receive my sayings and treasure my commandments within you, make your ear attentive to wisdom and climb your heart to understanding for if you cry for discernment.
[time=2661] Lift your voice for understanding if you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures, then you will discern the fear of the Lord and discover the knowledge of God.
[time=2671] That's what they were doing that day. When Ezra stood to preach the Word of God, he read a passage of Scripture and then he talked about it to give this sense of it so that the people would have an understanding and benefit from it and it would change their life.
[time=2684] As they understand and saw God in ways they did not otherwise see him.
[time=2688] You find Jesus doing the same thing in Luke chapter 4 in the synagogue, which is where much of our church services have taken shape from.
[time=2697] It says there that Jesus came to Nazareth where he had been brought up and he was accustomed.
[time=2702] And as was his custom, he entered the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read. This is the reading.
[time=2708] And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him and he opened the book and found the place where it was written and he read a passage there from Isaiah 61 1.
[time=2716] After reading the passage, it says he closed the book and gave it back to the attendant and he sat down.
[time=2723] Now that doesn't mean he sat down to watch the rest of the service. He sat down because it was the sitting posture of the day. That was the way in which you taught.
[time=2731] Matthew 5 through 7, the sermon on the Mount, Jesus gave that entire sermon from his sitting position.
[time=2738] That was the sign of authority. A man would sit and speak and teach and preach.
[time=2742] So he handed the book back to the attendant and sat down so he could preach.
[time=2746] And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him and he began to say to them, today, this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.
[time=2754] And all were speaking well of him and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from his lips.
[time=2761] In other words, he went on to speak about that passage of scripture, Isaiah 61 1, and to define it and to explain it and to clarify it and to bring it applicable to them.
[time=2772] It's been fulfilled. Respond to it.
[time=2777] It goes on. John the Baptist in Matthew 3 was a preacher. He came preaching in the wilderness saying repent for the kingdom of God, is at hand.
[time=2787] The apostles doctrine acts 242. The church continuously devoting itself to the apostles teaching.
[time=2795] In Colossians 4, 16, Paul is closing off the book of Colossians and he tells the church at Colossae when you receive this letter, read it.
[time=2803] Have it read. Do the public reading. In other words, have it read and then preach it.
[time=2808] And then make sure it gets over to the church at Laodicea so they can do the same thing with it.
[time=2812] And when you're in transport, make sure you bring the letter I wrote to the Laodiceans back to your church and do the same thing there. Do the reading.
[time=2818] Preach the word of God. Read it and preach it. Read it and preach it. Read it and explain it.
[time=2822] Bring it to bear on people's lives. Communicate the divine truth that is in there for their lives.
[time=2828] That's exactly what Paul is telling Timothy to do here. When he says until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhortation and teaching.
[time=2836] And that has been the tradition of the church. We could read from Justin Martyrs writings at the beginning of the second century describing a typical Sunday morning service.
[time=2845] He said this. And on the day called Sunday, all who live in cities or in the country gather together to one place.
[time=2851] And the memoirs of the apostles or the writings of the prophets are read. As long as time permits.
[time=2857] Then when the reader has ceased, the president verbally instructs and exhorts to the imitation of these good things.
[time=2864] Then we all rise together and pray. The president, of course, another word for their pastor.
[time=2870] A hundred years later, the Latin father, Tertilians, said it this way.
[time=2874] We assembled to read our sacred writings. With the sacred words, we nourished our faith. We animate our hope.
[time=2880] We make our confidence more steadfast. And no less by inculcations of God's precepts, we confirm good habits.
[time=2888] In the same place also, exhortations are made, rebukes and sacred censors are administered. That would have been church discipline.
[time=2895] In the 14th century, John Whitcliffe, remembered as the morning star of the great reformation, said it this way.
[time=2901] The highest service that men may attain to on earth is to preach the word of God.
[time=2907] This service falls particularly to pastors and therefore God more strightly demands it of them.
[time=2912] And for this cause, Jesus Christ left other works and occupied himself mostly in preaching.
[time=2917] And thus did his apostles and for this, God loved them.
[time=2920] The church, however, is honored by most, by the preaching of God's word.
[time=2925] And hence, this is the best service that pastors may render unto God.
[time=2930] Martin Luther said it this way, "Since the health of the Christian and of the church depends on the word of God,
[time=2937] preaching and teaching of the word of God is both the most important part of the divine service
[time=2944] and the highest and only duty and obligation of every bishop, pastor and preacher." John Calvin in his institute said this, "The first and major mark of a true church was the faithful preaching of the word.
[time=2959] Wherever we see the word of God purely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to Christ's institution,
[time=2967] there it is not to be doubted. A church of God exists."
[time=2975] So this is the tradition of the church, given to us through the nation of Israel and its history to proclaim the word of God, to teach the word of God, then through Christ, then his apostles,
[time=2986] through Paul, through the exhortation to Timothy and down through the history of the church.
[time=2991] You say, "What does that look like? How do I know if I'm listening to a reading of Scripture, to a biblical message, to an expository message of the word of God?" Well, here are some checkpoints. The message will find its sole source in Scripture.
[time=3006] The message will find its sole source in Scripture.
[time=3011] Secondly, it will be extracted from Scripture as opposed to imposed on the Scriptures.
[time=3019] It will correctly interpret Scripture.
[time=3024] Fourthly, it will explain the original God-intended meaning of that passage, and it will apply that Scripture for today.
[time=3033] Check marks.
[time=3035] Is it source solely the word of God?
[time=3038] Is it clearly coming out of the word of God?
[time=3042] Is it correctly interpreting the word of God?
[time=3045] Does it explain the original God-intended meaning, and is it applied to my life?
[time=3052] And that's what is also referred to at the end of verse 13, to exhortation and teaching.
[time=3057] So it's not only the reading, but it's the exhortation, which is the application, the encouragement, the passion to obey that reading,
[time=3066] and the understanding of that reading, and then the teaching itself.
[time=3069] And the teaching is a broader word, which would include not just the preaching from the pulpit, but the teaching of the word of God in any place the church gathers.
[time=3076] So it would be our Christian school and all the Bible classes there.
[time=3078] It would be our women's Bible studies. It would be our ABS.
[time=3081] He says, "Timothy, give yourself to a completely biblical ministry." And the word give attention, by the way, in verse 13, is not just while you're doing it.
[time=3089] It understands all of the work that must go into it in order to do it right when you're doing it in public.
[time=3096] So it's all the preparation for the reading of the Scripture and the exhortation and the teaching.
[time=3102] You understand why then verse 14 is such an absolute tragedy.
[time=3106] Look at verse 14. Look at what's happening.
[time=3110] Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you.
[time=3115] Say, "What's a spiritual gift?" Does somebody give you a package with a bow on it and says, "This is your spiritual gift?" No, at the very point of your salvation, the Spirit of God not only indwells you and baptizes you into the body of Jesus Christ and seals you for eternal salvation such that you can't lose your salvation.
[time=3133] But He also gifts you. He gives you spiritual gifts.
[time=3137] The word is charisma. It doesn't mean personality. It means divine enablement for ministry.
[time=3142] Divine enablement for ministry.
[time=3144] Each one of us who has prayed to receive Jesus Christ at the very point of salvation has been given a package of spiritual gifts that enable them to do ministry in the body of Christ.
[time=3155] In the body of Christ and for the body of Christ.
[time=3157] And the one that had been given to Timothy was the gift of preaching.
[time=3162] And Timothy was walking away from his gift.
[time=3165] Timothy was walking away from the very thing for which God had redeemed him and placed him in the body of Jesus Christ so that he could minister to the other people through proclaiming and interpreting the word of God.
[time=3177] There are other gifts besides preaching.
[time=3180] There are listed in several places in the New Testament, Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12.
[time=3185] Prophecy, service, teaching, exhorting, giving, financial giving,
[time=3192] leadership, administration, mercy, on and on the list goes.
[time=3198] You have some of those.
[time=3201] Those are a special divine gift from God to allow you to contribute to the work of this church.
[time=3208] Timothy, as I've said, was walking away from his.
[time=3212] And there's always that temptation.
[time=3214] There's always the temptation to back out of using your spiritual gift.
[time=3218] In fact, that temptation came very early in the church's history.
[time=3222] In Acts 6, I'll read it to you if you don't want to turn there.
[time=3225] There was a concern, a criticism that was raised against the apostles' leadership.
[time=3229] And the criticism was this, there are some of our widows who are not being properly cared for.
[time=3234] They're not being served food in an equitable manner.
[time=3239] And so the people rose up and complained against the leadership of the church.
[time=3244] And so in verse 2 of chapter 6, the 12 summoned the congregation of the disciples and said this, "It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to serve tables." We are not going to have our attention diverted from our primary ministry as we've been gifted by God and as we see our place in the church to the serving of tables.
[time=3263] Instead, verse 3, "Select from among you brethren seven men of good reputation full of the spirit and of wisdom whom we may put in charge of this task." In other words, find some men in your ministry that have been gifted not for preaching, but for serving and put them in charge of that task.
[time=3279] And then the reaffirmation, "But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word."
[time=3286] So at the very beginning of the church, there was an attempt to undermine and take away the foundation
[time=3295] of the commitment to the reading of the word of God.
[time=3298] The preparation for the preaching and teaching of God's words.
[time=3302] But the apostles set the example and say, "No, we will not be distracted.
[time=3306] We will not be taken away from that." So as we move through the passage then we notice that the effective pastor states the truth.
[time=3315] He has a thoroughly biblical ministry and a thoroughly biblical message in verse 13.
[time=3320] And then number 9, he is spiritually gifted. He is supernaturally gifted.
[time=3324] And you'll notice that gift in verse 14 was bestowed upon him through the prophetic utterance of the laying on of hands by the presubitary.
[time=3332] If you go to Acts 13, you'll notice that some prophets, which also were used by the Lord of that day to speak the word of the Lord before the canon was complete, set Paul and Barnabas aside for ministry.
[time=3342] That would be the prophetic utterance.
[time=3344] And apparently though we don't have it recorded anywhere in Scripture, the actual incident, there was a time when a prophet or prophets came to Timothy and by prophetic utterance said, "You are called to preach and teach the word of God." And then that prophetic utterance was confirmed by the presubitary or the eldership or the leadership of the church in which he was serving.
[time=3361] And they said not only has God spoken through that prophet, but we want you to know as a church, we know who you are, we've seen the character of your life, the level of giftedness, the way that God brings fruit from your efforts and we lay our hands on you as a sign of identification to indeed say you are called into the ministry.
[time=3377] Timothy, you can't neglect your gift.
[time=3379] It was given to you by God, confirmed by prophetic utterance and established and reconfirmed by the church.
[time=3385] You are accountable to God and to those people to fulfill your ministry.
[time=3389] And then last.
[time=3410] I hope that you've enjoyed the music of our sanctuary choir and soloist, Laurie Scheiman.
[time=3415] The message today was the third in the series by our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3420] If as a result of our program, you've made a decision today to trust Christ, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3428] Let's bow and pray.
[time=3429] Our dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I have a need
[time=3436] for you to come into my heart.
[time=3438] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior.
[time=3442] In Jesus' name I pray.
[time=3444] [AMEN] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
