[time=0] We live in a day, at an age that exonerates youth, a day that has little, if anything,
[time=7] to say or care or concern about elderly people.
[time=11] And yet the growing population of elderly people in America is growing at a staggering rate.
[time=17] What does the word of God have to say about how to treat elderly people, and in particular, widows, women who are destitute of their husbands and therefore left to be cared for by the
[time=27] church?
[time=28] How should that occur?
[time=29] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=46] you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=48] Thank you for joining us.
[time=51] Widows, it's not one of the first topics that comes to your mind when you think of all the great New Testament teachings, is it?
[time=56] But do you realize that the Apostle Paul in his book of First Timothy invests more time in talking about widows than he does about either elders or deacons?
[time=66] Perhaps he knew we would need a little more emphasis on this topic.
[time=69] Stay with us as Pastor Russ explores this passage in a message he's entitled "Caring for the Widow." We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of First Timothy.
[time=80] We'll be looking in at Chapter 5, Verses 3 through 16.
[time=100] As we begin our service today, we welcome back Marcia Keough, who was a part of Black ocular high school and college days, Marcia will be singing "There is a Savior."
[time=114] "There is a Savior, the joy expressed, His eyes are mercy, His world is raised."
[time=144] "There is a Savior, who lights our way."
[time=174] Are there burdens in your heart?
[time=177] Is your past a memory that binds you?
[time=185] Is there some pain that you've carried far too long?
[time=194] Then strengthen your heart with His good news, "There is a Savior, and He's forgiven me."
[time=218] "There is a Savior, who joy expressed, His eyes are mercy, His world is raised."
[time=241] "There is a Savior, who lights our way."
[time=291] Because we want to tell you about Jesus Christ, if you don't know Him as your personal Savior,
[time=314] what a joy it would be today to listen to the words of the music and the message from our pastor and say, "I want to know this Jesus, who's my friend, my Savior, my hope for eternal
[time=325] life." I hope that's your case today if you don't know Him as personal Savior.
[time=330] In the last couple of weeks, Gary and Becky Wollman have been in Israel and they've had a tremendous time visiting there, the ruins, and the places where Jesus walked.
[time=340] A great experience as we heard them talk about it last Wednesday night and I asked them to come and introduce our choir number today and tell you just a little bit about their experiences in the last week, Becky and Gary Wollman.
[time=354] We just had a wonderful time studying at the Institute of Holy Land studies in Jerusalem.
[time=366] We will never ever forget how it changed our lives and how the Bible has really come alive for us.
[time=372] We walked up many hills and down many hills, up many canyons, down many canyons.
[time=378] We visited a lot of ruins, places from biblical times.
[time=383] We swam where Jesus walked.
[time=387] We visited very hot, dry, desolate wilderness.
[time=393] We discovered we weren't too much different than the murmuring children of Israel when they were wandering through the wilderness themselves.
[time=400] We visited an archaeological dig at Tel Dan, which is in the northern part of Israel, which is the oldest standing gate dating back to Abraham's time.
[time=409] We explored ancient Jericho and then left this beautiful oasis and climbed up the barren
[time=415] chalky cliffs on the old Roman road where the good Samaritan helped out that man in need on his way to Jerusalem.
[time=422] I think we'll be forever struck by the diversity of the land of Israel.
[time=428] When you think about it, the land mass is half the size of Indiana.
[time=432] So diverse, there are tremendous cliffs, the deepest valley of anywhere on the earth.
[time=437] On the edge of the desolate Dead Sea, we visited an oasis with lush vegetation, beautiful
[time=443] waterfalls with fresh water.
[time=445] What diversity, what beauty, what desolation, but we just couldn't help but marvel at the
[time=451] amazing God that we have.
[time=454] So many of the songs that we sing as Christians are based on scripture verses, and as we were standing on a cliff, particular verses in Isaiah 40 came to my mind, "They go like this.
[time=466] Let every valley be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low and let the rough ground
[time=472] become a plain and the rugged terrain abroad valley.
[time=476] Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed and all flesh will see it together for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." That verse is very special because we learned the words of the verses from the song that the choir is going to sing.
[time=492] Next, "Our experience there in Israel and seeing the diversity of the land made us realize what an incredible God we have and how very small we are."
[time=511] "Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain they go.
[time=531] And the crooked, plain, straight, and the wrong places play."
[time=550] And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the
[time=577] mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
[time=587] Every valley shall be exalted and every mountain they go.
[time=600] And the crooked, straight, and the rough places play and all flesh shall see it together for
[time=620] the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the Lord
[time=648] hath spoken it.
[time=667] Alleluia again and thank you for joining the Bible Hour.
[time=673] I hope that your summer is going well Russell, we've had some ideal weather for Indiana and it's made a good situation for you to change from the house you were renting into the house
[time=683] that you just recently purchased.
[time=685] That's right, that's gone very smoothly for us.
[time=688] We moved here about a year ago, we thought we'd rent and we found a place close to the church and it really met our needs and then several months ago we started realizing it's time to look into a buying house and we found one also very close to the house but it's needed a lot of renovation and we've been in the process of that for a couple of months but we've had tremendous help from the people of the church and all that's over now and finished and so we're in perfect shape to enjoy the summer.
[time=710] Well you've got a lot of good time, we hope that the weather stays the way it is, usually humidity strikes about right now.
[time=719] For some of you that have been listening we've been talking about the summer celebration that we have at Blackhawk Baptist Church and we just want to remind you of that that each Wednesday evening at 7 p.m. here at the church we have a special program, the next one on
[time=732] June 24th will be Ron Scarf and he is a fine professor that really knows the word of God
[time=740] and you'll be inspired by his speaking, he's a professor at Summit Christian College and
[time=747] just a wonderful man of God and I hope that you will take time on Wednesday nights to come and join with us, kind of a refresher time in the middle of the week, that's Wednesday evenings at 7 o'clock and then we're fast approaching the patriotic panorama, that's
[time=762] coming on June 28th at 4 p.m.
[time=765] Also that was probably the first major event that we had when you came here last year and
[time=771] we have a number of guests that come, people that watch the Bible hour but come for that special day as we thank the Lord for America and thank God for just being the God he is.
[time=781] Well it's a unique environment and approach to celebrating America, a lot of times when you want to celebrate our nation, you end up out in a park somewhere with a whole bunch of people that are under the influence of alcohol and it's just a different environment out there and in our church there's a real clean wholesome appreciation and expression
[time=800] of gratitude for what God has given us and the music that comes is so inspiring and most of the time you have goosebumps as you're thinking about the privilege of being an American and all the history of our nation and the sacrifice that people have made so I'm looking forward
[time=815] to it again this year.
[time=816] You made a special attempt, in fact we sent some of our camera people to Washington to take video of all of our national monuments, interviewed some senators and representatives and that will be included in this year's patriotic panorama, it took some time to even see a name on the Vietnam Memorial, his name is Connie Lubas, Connie was a high school student
[time=838] with me and remember the time that I sat and led Connie to the Lord and then he took off for Vietnam and unfortunately didn't return but I'm always thankful when I see that name on the wall that I know that he's in heaven with our father and I'll be able to see him again.
[time=854] So that program is on Sunday afternoon June 28th at 4 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk
[time=860] Baptist Church and those of you that are members of the Founders Club perhaps you have received or will receive this week the copy of Fresh Moments, it's a great devotional and I just
[time=871] want to remind you again to pick it up and read it, there are some excellent articles of theme for every week in the next two months and I hope that you will read it, take time,
[time=881] each day's reading is not very long but will be an inspiration to you and then we're going to continue to invite you to write for the character cards, the Bible character cards
[time=892] have been going very fast, again we're out of stock but we have ordered some more and you can receive them if you'll just write to the Bible hour today at 7400 East State,
[time=902] Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815, just ask for the Bible character cards from
[time=909] the Bible hour, the address again is 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code
[time=915] is 46815, we'll go back to the live portion of our program now with some more music and
[time=923] then the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore, stay tuned for the remainder of our program.
[time=953] [MUSIC - 438 seconds]
[time=1415] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bibles as is our custom and turn to the Book of 1 Timothy. And if you happen to be visiting with us this morning or haven't been with us for some time, you'll be interested to know that we continue in a verse by verse paragraph by paragraph study of the book of 1 Timothy and we have made it in our quest to chapter 5 verses 3 through 16. And it's really a challenging passage of scripture both
[time=1444] to understand and interpret and in some ways to preach. It is 14 verses about widows. Now not that there's anything disparaging about a widow or being a widow, it just kind of catches you by surprise. You're hearing a personal letter from the Apostle Paul to his child in the faith, Timothy, about a church that is struggling, it's under attack, there is demonic influence there, a gospel is being perverted and watered down, and so there is instruction in chapter 1 about the true and the true and the true and the true.
[time=1473] Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is then some chapters about the order of the church in which we are told to pray evangelistically and to set up the order of the church and the women's role and the deacons and the elders and all that starts to make sense and you come into chapter 4 and there's this long discourse about expository preaching from the Word of God and all that adds up in your understanding about a church that's struggling, that's under attack, that's got false prophets and false teachers that are distorting the truth.
[time=1502] And you turn the quarter at the end of chapter 5 and run into this verses 1 and 2 where we're called to be personally involved with each other and even that makes sense to us because we're taking the truth, that's articulated from the pulpit and we're applying it to each other's lives, but now 14 verses about widows and you kind of scratch your head and say why?
[time=1525] How does this add up in the flow of the book? Why does the Apostle Paul into the inspiration of the Spirit of God choose to include the longest, most detailed, most comprehensive discussion of widows in all of the Bible, old or New Testament?
[time=1540] He spent 8 verses talking about evangelistic prayer in chapter 2, he gave 7 verses to women, 7 verses to elders, 6 verses to deacons and now 14 verses as to how were to treat widows.
[time=1557] Well if you're interested in trying to understand as I have been all week why he would do that, why don't you put a finger here in 1 Timothy and come with me back to the book of Isaiah.
[time=1566] And come to chapter 1 and come to a period of history in the nation of Israel's existence where their religion had degenerated to the externals.
[time=1576] Where they were no longer walking in a vibrant communion with the true and living God, there was no spirit or fire in their walk with Yahweh.
[time=1586] They had reduced their religious experience to mere externals and the things which God had given them by way of sacrifices and that cultic behavior of the Old Testament, those were all given to be outward signs of an inward reality but in their case it was just an outward sign.
[time=1604] Verse 11 of chapter 1, "What are your multiplied sacrifices to me?" says the Lord, "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams."
[time=1613] In other words, stop it, verse 13, "Bring your worthless offerings no longer."
[time=1619] Verse 14, "I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts." That's not because that was the wrong system of worship, I mean that was what God had given them. The problem was it was devoid of a heart commitment of true loving adoration of the living God and it was now just an external ceremony.
[time=1640] And what always happens when religion is reduced to the externals is that people lose their sense of commitment to justice and to righteousness.
[time=1651] Verse 16, "Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, remove the evil of your deeds from my sight, cease to do evil, learn to do good, seek justice."
[time=1663] Now what's that look like? "Reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan and plead for the widow."
[time=1670] Over and over again in Israel's history as God would intersect with them as they would lose the passion of their relationship with God, he would speak to them as to their disregard for the people who are destitute and in need of help.
[time=1684] In Jeremiah he says this, "Thus says the Lord, do justice and righteousness and deliver the one who has been robbed from the power of his oppressor.
[time=1693] Also, do not mistreat or do violence to the stranger, the orphan, the widow, and do not shed innocent blood in this place."
[time=1702] Zechariah 7, verses 9 and 10, "Thus says the Lord of Host, dispense true justice and practice kindness and compassion each to his brother and do not oppress the widow or the orphan, the stranger or the poor, and do not devise evil in your hearts against one another."
[time=1720] In Malachi 3.5 he is promising the destruction and judgment upon the people because they oppress the wage earner in his wages, the widow and the orphan and those who turn aside the alien.
[time=1734] Here the widow is grouped with the orphan, the wage earner, the poor, the destitute, and God is saying that if there is real religion in your life, if you are really worshiping me regardless of the externals of your faith,
[time=1748] regardless of whether or not you come to church and sing the songs and have a ministry, he is saying the litmus test of your Christianity, the shoe leather that is to be put to your Christianity is to be found and evidenced in the way you treat the destitute, the poor, the widow, the orphan.
[time=1765] In fact, he calls himself in Psalm 68 verse 5, a father to the fatherless and a defender of widows. He sees himself in that role that is his heart and true justice emanates from his character and his understanding actually hit the essence of what he is and he expects us to grab ahold of that justice and to give it to those in times of need, as an expression of true godliness.
[time=1789] In Exodus 22-22 he says this, "Don't afflict the widow or the orphan, I will hear his cry and my anger will be kindled and I will kill you with the sword and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless."
[time=1803] In other words, if you're not going to show compassion and grace and ministry to the widow and the orphan, then you can count on the fact I'll just kill you and make your wife the widow and your child the orphan.
[time=1814] And again, the whole of scripture comes back to its completeness of thought, the harmony of thought, James chapter 1 verse 27, this is pure and undefiled religion in the sight of our god and father to visit orphans and widows in their distress.
[time=1831] And the word visit doesn't mean show up, pat him on the shoulder, say have a nice day, hand him a flower and leave, the notion behind visit is to come with the intent purpose of helping minister to their physical spiritual needs.
[time=1844] Luke 2046, Jesus gives a scathing denunciation against the scribes who are noted as devouring widow's houses.
[time=1852] These men have developed an entire system of taking their money under the religious guise.
[time=1859] So now back to 1 Timothy, 1 Timothy chapter 5, 14 verses.
[time=1866] What is Paul doing? Paul is saying to the church of Ephesus, it is not enough that you have a right understanding of the gospel.
[time=1873] It is not enough that you have a right understanding of church order and polity and elders and deacons.
[time=1878] It is not enough that you have a commitment to the word of God and that it's preached clearly every time you meet in the public assembly.
[time=1886] It's not even enough in verses 1 and 2 of chapter 5 that you are personally involved with each other applying the principles of the word of God individually to each other's lives.
[time=1894] I want to grab one item out of many that will really test the quality of your faith, really test the essence of your religion and its widows and here is how you care for them.
[time=1904] This is the bottom line, if you will, of religion. If you are in business, you are tested on your bottom line.
[time=1909] I don't care how many sales promotions you ran. I don't care about your new products. I don't care about your investments.
[time=1915] What I want to know is did you make money? Business people know a bottom line.
[time=1921] This would be one of the bottom lines of religion. Don't tell me about your activity. Don't tell me about your intentions.
[time=1927] Don't give me lip service. Let me see how you are treating your widows.
[time=1931] And so we ask ourselves this morning the question, how is Blackhawk, Baptist Church treating their widows?
[time=1940] How are we treating our widows?
[time=1944] The practical issue which dominates this passage is monetary support.
[time=1950] Are we caring financially for our widows? Are we meeting their material needs?
[time=1956] Are these women, and by the way widow, the word means destitute or alone bereaved?
[time=1961] And so is group with the orphan and the others in the Old Testament who are in dire straits and dire need.
[time=1968] And what this passage teaches us is that some widows get supported by the church and others don't.
[time=1976] Others have another means of support. In other words, God is committed to all widows and God cares about all widows,
[time=1983] but He doesn't want all widows to be treated the same way, and He doesn't want all widows to be treated as a first line of defense by the church itself.
[time=1991] So there's a brief overview. Let's move into the passage now.
[time=1994] We're going to look at three different categories of widows.
[time=1998] They are one, the widow indeed, and we will meet her in verse three.
[time=2003] The second category is what we'll call the widow with a family, and we'll meet her in verse four.
[time=2009] And the third category of widow is the widow in need of a family, verse eleven.
[time=2014] So you have a widow indeed, a widow with a family, and thirdly a widow in need of a family, verses eleven and following.
[time=2021] Tell me about the widow indeed, verse three. Honor widows who are widows indeed.
[time=2027] In other words, who are really widows, who are really destitute, who are really without help, who are really without support.
[time=2034] In other words, these are the widows who have not only lost their husband, but they have no extended family.
[time=2039] They have no children, they have no aunts, they have no uncles, they have nobody in their extended family that can help them support themselves.
[time=2046] And they are also without an inheritance. They are also without some type of means by which they can support themselves.
[time=2053] So they are truly widowed. They are truly desperate.
[time=2058] They are further described in verse five. Now she who is a widow indeed, and who has been left alone.
[time=2066] So there is continued emphasis upon the aloneness of her condition.
[time=2071] She has fixed her hope on God, and continues it in treaties and prayers night and day.
[time=2077] In other words, the diversity, excuse me, the adversity in her life, the travesty of her losing her only family member, her only husband.
[time=2087] The only one she ever had probably, but in other words, there is no surrounding family.
[time=2091] This is the one person in the whole world I call family, he is my husband, now he is dead.
[time=2096] She has allowed that adversity to drive her to fix her hope on the true and living God, which evidences itself and continued in treaties and prayers night and day.
[time=2107] And of course, this isn't that, you know, she goes to the temple like Anna did in Luke chapter two awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem.
[time=2115] Anna had said there had a husband seven years and then as a prophetess went to the temple and stayed to the age of 84 and she never left the temple.
[time=2122] Serving day and night with fasting and prayers. That's not what this says in mind.
[time=2127] This is a prevalent attitude of this woman. She is consumed with her hope, the eschatological future of her hope, the fact that she will one day be in heaven and all will be made right.
[time=2136] And in the interim she continues and in treaties and prayers night and day.
[time=2140] So the adversity has driven her in a positive way to deepen her commitment and her love for God.
[time=2148] Now she's further described in verse nine, nine and ten.
[time=2153] Let the widow, or let a widow be put on the list, and we'll talk about that list in a minute.
[time=2160] Be put on the list only if she is not less than 60 years old, having been the wife of one man, having a reputation for good works.
[time=2171] In other words, put the widow indeed on this particular list.
[time=2176] If she meets these qualifications, she needs to be over 60 years old.
[time=2180] She has been the wife of only one man. That's the exact same Greek construction as we saw in first Timothy chapter three when we talked about the one woman man.
[time=2188] It's not that he's never been married more than once. It's not that he's never had a divorce. It's not any of those things.
[time=2193] Instead, it is a person who is utterly devoted to the one to whom they are married.
[time=2199] She is a one man woman, utterly devoted, verse ten and has a reputation for good works.
[time=2206] Well, what are those? Well, those are explained in verse ten. She's brought up children.
[time=2210] She has shown hospitality to strangers. She has washed the saint's feet, and there's some discussion as to what that might mean.
[time=2216] It could mean that she was a regular participant in communion in the washing of feet, even as the Lord did on the first communion.
[time=2223] But more likely, it refers to the problem of their day, the unpaved roads and the dirt and the dust and all the stuff that came with that particular environment and the sandals.
[time=2232] And when you entered somebody's house, you washed your feet.
[time=2235] And this is apparently this woman not only provided for that foot washing, but then did it herself, servant.
[time=2243] And then also in verse ten, if she has assisted those in distress. I think that's interesting.
[time=2249] Here is a widow, could have been translated a distressed one, who now is put on the list of care and loving concern because when she was not in distress, she helped those who were.
[time=2260] And if she has devoted herself to every good work. That's quite a profile. That's quite a woman.
[time=2266] That is quite a godly character in reputation.
[time=2271] So she is alone with absolutely no family and no support.
[time=2276] Her profile, again, she has allowed the adversity of her life to drive her to God fixing her hope on him.
[time=2283] She's sixty years old or older. She has been a one-man woman, and she has a reputation for good works.
[time=2291] What do you do with a widow like that? That's called a widow indeed.
[time=2294] And as we have noted in verse nine, let a widow be put on the list.
[time=2299] The list. What list? Well, this, I believe, is a list of women who meet these qualifications that is in the background of Acts chapter six, where there was great debate and discussion as to those widows.
[time=2313] Some of them were Aramaic speaking widows, and others were Greek speaking widows.
[time=2317] They were both a group of Jewish widows that had come out of Judaism in the Christianity, and the way the church was dispensing the food, one to the other group, there was some division that it wasn't happening in a fair and legitimate way.
[time=2330] The list is nowhere noted in Acts six, but it seems as if the list might be in the background of that kind of a situation.
[time=2336] What you notice again in verse three were told to honor these women. Honor is a very interesting word.
[time=2343] It's the same one used in first Peter chapter two, verse seventeen, honor the king.
[time=2348] That's the kind of thing he has in mind. If he's in six, honor your father and your mother.
[time=2354] In other words, the support that you give to these who are called widows indeed, who meet this qualification, they in essence go on an honor roll, where their financial needs are met in a very gracious and plentiful way.
[time=2370] They're not to be cared for if you want to turn over a page, the first ten of these six, verse eight, if we have food and covering with these things we shall be content.
[time=2380] All Christians are called to be content if they have two things, food and clothing, food and covering.
[time=2386] Apparently what's going on here in our passage, this honoring of the widow, it means you take care of her in a very comfortable, satisfying, gracious way because she's deserved it.
[time=2398] She should feel no sense of a handout, she should feel no guilt, this is not an act of pity, this is not something that we do because we're obligated to do it because she's put us in a difficult situation.
[time=2409] This is something that based on the virtue of her life, the character of her life, we as a church would do and it would only be an honor for us to do it and it should be received by her as an honor.
[time=2420] In the same sense that a soldier would come back from battle having done great and heroic things above and beyond the call of duty, it is our privilege and it is his honor to receive such designation and distinction so these women would be treated.
[time=2441] So the first group of widows are widows indeed, described for us in verses 3, 5, 9 and 10. The second group we meet in verse 4, and these are the widows with a family.
[time=2454] Look at it in verse 4, but if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents, for this is acceptable in the sight of God.
[time=2467] The profile of this woman, as little as said, there are no spiritual qualifications, there is no age, there is no reputation, there is nothing said about children other than that she has some, but how she brought them up, the good works, now that is listed, it's just very basic.
[time=2483] If there's a woman who has lost her husband and she has children, whether they be first generation or second generation, it's their responsibility to care for her, they are her first line of support.
[time=2496] And that's kind of an interesting thing in our day and age, most people are only interested in their parents because their parents may have some kind of an inheritance that the kids are waiting with baited breath to grab a hold of.
[time=2508] In our day is one in which the elderly people who don't have that kind of an inheritance are seen as a great burden, as a great obligation, as an intrusion on the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness, and the best thing to do with them is shove them off somewhere where we don't have to see them anymore.
[time=2526] And I'm not trying to make a wholesale comment about rest homes and those kinds of things, I believe there are times when those are appropriate, if I'm talking about the spirit of our age, the spirit of our day, children are basically only interested in their parents because their parents may have an inheritance.
[time=2543] They want nothing to learn from them, they want to spend little time with them, it is merely a financial issue.
[time=2550] But the word of God says that if this widow has children or grandchildren, let them first one, first reason is to practice their piety in regard to their own family.
[time=2560] In other words, if you're going to call yourself a Christian, apply the principles of Christianity first in your own family, minister to somebody who can give you nothing.
[time=2571] If the widow had something, if she had an inheritance, if she had money, it wouldn't apply.
[time=2577] These are obviously widows who don't have any money, who without help are destitute.
[time=2582] And so they are a classic situation where we as believers are called to give to someone and know we'll receive nothing in return.
[time=2591] Practice your religion at home.
[time=2594] The second reason that the children are supposed to do that, look at the end of verse four, and to make some return to their parents.
[time=2601] In other words, you owe it to them.
[time=2602] For crying out loud, they raised you.
[time=2605] They gave you food and clothing and a house and probably an education and all the rest that went with it.
[time=2610] And now they're in need and there's some question as to whether or not you're going to meet their financial needs.
[time=2615] Ridiculous.
[time=2617] In fact, it's so ridiculous to get to verse eight, but if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith.
[time=2626] And he is worse than an unbeliever.
[time=2629] In other words, you can't live like that and hang on to a profession of faith in Christ.
[time=2635] That's ridiculous.
[time=2637] Even unbelievers care for their unbelieving parents.
[time=2641] And they have never been the beneficiaries of the love of Christ and the sacrifice that's been made on their behalf.
[time=2648] They don't have the Holy Spirit to lead them into an understanding of the Word of God as to what the love of God would look like in other people's lives.
[time=2655] You've got to be kidding, Paul says.
[time=2657] If you're not even willing to provide for your own household, you've denied the faith.
[time=2663] The actions of your life have mitigated the words that come out of your mouth and you're worse than an unbeliever.
[time=2672] So the provision is the family, not the church.
[time=2681] Now the third group is introduced to us in verse 11.
[time=2687] They're called younger widows. See it there, but refuse to put younger widows on the list.
[time=2693] For when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married, thus incurring condemnation because they have set aside their previous pledge.
[time=2702] At the same time, they also learn to be idle as they go around from house to house, and not merely idle, but also gossips and busy bodies, talking about things not proper to mention.
[time=2712] Verse 14, "Therefore I want younger widows to get married, bear children, keep house, and give the enemy no occasion for approach, for some have already turned aside to follow Satan."
[time=2724] What's the profile?
[time=2726] These are younger women, and presumably in the context, younger than 60.
[time=2731] They're younger women, and they are not to be put on the list.
[time=2734] They are not to receive this status of official support from the church.
[time=2740] I believe also that the profile includes the fact that they likely don't have children.
[time=2745] Now that also is not explicitly stated, but it's my best guess.
[time=2749] Why do I say that?
[time=2751] The issue here is a young widow receiving support from the church, and if she has no children, and she doesn't have to work, what is she?
[time=2762] She's idle. She has no responsibilities. She has no kids, and she has no need to work.
[time=2768] And in her idleness, she becomes overcome by her sensual desires, and she denies her pledge, her pledge to purity, her pledge that every believer makes when they come to Christ to abstain from sexual immorality.
[time=2783] And then verse 13 says it more specifically, "They learn to be idle, implied in my mind is because they don't have any children responsibilities, and they don't have any work responsibilities."
[time=2793] And so they eventually going around from house to house, involved in all this gossip and busybody, and then talking about things that shouldn't be mentioned.
[time=2800] In other words, if you take my wife, if I were to die, then you take my wife, and you pick up all her financial support, she is anything but idle.
[time=2809] We have four kids. She doesn't work for our supporters, it is. The financial part, but she works completely and totally at times or the point of exhaustion because she's got four daughters.
[time=2821] In other words, these have got to be younger widows who do not have kids, and who have put on the list of financial support would find themselves with an enormous amount of time and nothing to do with it.
[time=2834] And so they begin to entertain the sensual desires that are part and parcel to her age, but they become degrading sensual desires, and they lead her into condemnation.
[time=2846] They lead her into judgment. It's the same word over in 1 Corinthians 11 when we talk about communion. It's not damnation as in hell, it's the necessity to guide and guard one's heart and to confess sin or be disciplined by the Lord.
[time=2860] 1 Corinthians 11 verses 29-32. So don't put her on the list. Proverbs 31-27, you remember the great passage in the Old Testament about the virtuous woman who is so industrious with her family?
[time=2875] And it says she never goes to bed, and then it says she gets up early. I don't know how she does that, but this woman never seems to sleep, and she's always sowing, and she's always mending, and she's always preparing for adversity.
[time=2885] And she's a great businesswoman because she buys a field and makes a profit. In other words, she is absolutely mourning tonight consumed with her household and her children.
[time=2894] It says there, Proverbs 31-27, that she does not eat the bread of idleness. She can't get into trouble, she can't fall into sin.
[time=2903] She's too busy to have an affair. She couldn't take the time out of her day to do it. So don't put her on the list.
[time=2911] Instead, verse 14, have her get married. I want younger widows to get married, bear children, keep house and give the enemy no occasion for her approach.
[time=2925] That would be God's intended role for her. That's what she needs to do.
[time=2931] So three categories of widows. The widow indeed. She is alone. Adversity drives her in a hope towards God.
[time=2939] She is over 60, which is also kind of the age when people stop working by virtue of the inability of the physical body to maintain the stamina, especially in a day and an age like theirs, where death's jobs were not really available.
[time=2954] If you were going to work, you were going to work by the sweat of your brow. The widow indeed has a life of character and good works through her children, strangers, washing a feet and distress.
[time=2965] Her provision put her on the honor roll. Take care of her.
[time=2969] Meet her financial needs, not in some minimum level way. You commit yourself as a church to caring for her financial needs.
[time=2977] There's a question that comes here. What about the widow who is over 60, but she doesn't meet the qualifications? She's over 60, she's that part of it, and she's alone, and there's no family, but she doesn't meet verses 9 and 10.
[time=2995] She hasn't been the wife of one man. She doesn't have a good reputation for work. What are we to do with her?
[time=3001] Well, one thing we're not supposed to do is put her on the list. And I would suggest to you that those types of situations are to be examined and evaluated on an individual basis in the exact same way that we would consider anybody else's financial need.
[time=3017] What I'm saying is there is no divine obligation here in this text to do something spectacular with that kind of person, the widow indeed in the sense that she's totally alone yet over 60.
[time=3029] There may be some commitment by the church as it's reviewed by a board or something to meet the basic levels of food and covering, but it's far cry from this list and the honor that comes with this list.
[time=3043] And we've seen the widow with a family. She's bereaved of a husband, but not bereaved of a supporting family, and they are to meet her financial needs.
[time=3051] And you ask them, well, what happens if the family doesn't want to do it? She's got a family, but they have no interest in supporting her.
[time=3057] And in fact, they refuse. Maybe they're unbelieving that she comes to you and says, what are you going to do for me? You're my church.
[time=3063] And I would say the same thing. There may be a responsibility there. They're likely as a responsibility there, and the board would have to review that, and we would have to understand that situation.
[time=3072] And if she can't work and if she has no Social Security and no way to care for herself, then I believe that our church would need to do something to help her, but again, it's different than that list or honor roll for the widow indeed.
[time=3085] And then the last group, the younger widow, she is in need of a family. She needs to get married in her provision, then we'll come from her marriage, and she'll be cared for.
[time=3094] And you say, what happens if she can't get married? What happens if she wants to obey this, but she can't? Nobody wants to marry her.
[time=3101] Once again, we are back at the same place where probably or likely as a younger widow, her responsibility would be to find a job and support herself and care for herself and involve herself in the ministry of the church, even as a single might from our study of 1 Corinthians 7.
[time=3118] And then later in her life, when she is too old to work, there may be need for her to be evaluated and considered under the support of the church.
[time=3131] Now look at two other verses I want to just pinpoint to you, verse six.
[time=3136] But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives.
[time=3142] Of course, this is a description of a woman who has no doubt made some profession of faith, has been a part of the church, her husband died, and it threw her off the deep end.
[time=3151] And instead of the adversity driving her towards God, this adversity drove her to wanton pleasure, and it says she's dead even while she lives.
[time=3158] She's spiritually dead even while she's physically alive. And no provision is to be made for her.
[time=3164] Then verse 16. If any woman who is a believer has dependent widows, let her assist them and let not the church be burdened so that it may assist those who are widows indeed.
[time=3180] See what's going on here? You've got a lady who may or may not be a widow, but she has resources. She has financial, you know, she's well to do.
[time=3190] And she understands God's commitment to widows. And so she begins to support these widows and may even help them in ways widows and aren't widows indeed.
[time=3201] You understand? This woman is caring for widows who don't even qualify as widows indeed.
[time=3207] In the Word of God says, "Let her assist him." That's not wrong. Keep doing that. That's no problem.
[time=3212] Be involved at that level. If that's your heart and that's your ministry.
[time=3215] But those widows are not to be the care and the concern of the church so that they can give themselves to those who are called widows indeed.
[time=3228] Let me wrap this up with a couple points of application. Number one.
[time=3234] Need, need does not determine the call. What you see here is the Apostle Paul narrowly defining the way that the church will intersect with widows.
[time=3246] This is not a wholesale commitment of the church to meet every widow's financial need. In fact, it's a very limiting passage.
[time=3254] Let me say it this way. The church is not a, the mission of the church is not a philanthropic mission. Jesus said, "The poor you always have with you."
[time=3265] The mission of the church is not to go out and find all the homeless people and all the widows and all the people in financial distress and use all of our resources to somehow meet their physical needs.
[time=3275] The mission of the church is to propagate the gospel of Jesus Christ and to take it to the uttermost ends of the earth. And in the process of doing that, we will no doubt encounter people with physical needs.
[time=3286] And we will meet their needs as best as we can as we feel led by the Spirit of God even as the good Samaritan did, but it is not the mission of the church to wipe out poverty and to wipe out everybody's physical needs.
[time=3299] And some churches have failed to make note of that and have lost their effectiveness for the cause of Christ because of it.
[time=3306] Secondly, caring for one's dependent parents is a serious responsibility.
[time=3314] If you are here this morning and you have or soon know you'll have dependent parents, you had best be preparing in your heart and making the necessary practical arrangements to take care of them.
[time=3328] And that should be first an expression of your love for God in practicing your piety in home and secondly because you know you owe it to them anyway.
[time=3335] And thirdly because if you don't, you're less or worse than an unbeliever.
[time=3343] And lastly, as we compare the widow indeed in verse 5 with the other one in verse 6, grief does not always result in godliness.
[time=3354] Grief does not always automatically produce godliness in somebody's life.
[time=3360] In the widow indeed's life, the grief of losing the only person in the world that was called a member of her family, her own husband, that grief drove her to fix her hope on God.
[time=3370] The widow in verse 6 saw the grief as a compelling agent to want and to pleasure and so she is dead even while she lives.
[time=3381] The grief, the trial, and that's true in your life, that's true in my life.
[time=3386] The trials in our lives, the difficulties in our lives, the disappointment in our lives do not necessarily produce godliness.
[time=3395] And we've all met the people who are old and bitter and angry and calcified in their rebellion.
[time=3403] As we come to the close of our service, I want to thank the sanctuary choir for their ministry of music as well as special guest soloist Marcia Keough and the reflection and Scott Schindler for their fine music today.
