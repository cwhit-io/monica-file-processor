[time=0] You know, I think I'm like most people when I want my life to have meaning.
[time=5] And as a Christian, I want my faith to have a genuineness that carries on even after I'm gone, that impacts people's life.
[time=12] I think these same kind of thoughts are going through the mind of Moses as he stood before the people of Israel and gave them direction and instruction and how they could have a faith that would not be forgotten.
[time=23] Join us as we look at Deuteronomy chapter 6 and considering the kind of faith that will carry on, a faith that will not be forgotten.
[time=43] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=49] Thank you for joining us.
[time=51] As we grow older, it seems that we become more interested in how people will remember us.
[time=56] Our characteristic was also true for individuals in the Old Testament.
[time=60] In today's message, Associate Pastor Tim Teder will examine a brief section of Moses life in a message he has entitled "A Faith That Won't Be Forgotten."
[time=70] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the Old Testament Book of Deuteronomy.
[time=74] We will be looking in at chapter 6 verses 4 through 9.
[time=79] Our special music today includes our sanctuary choir singing a patriotic anthem entitled Hold the Flame of Freedom High.
[time=86] And just before Pastor Tim speaks, Brian Lawson will be singing a song made popular by Wayne Watson entitled "Watercolor Ponies." As we begin our service today, Becky Wollman reminds us that, in this day of media and sports heroes, Jesus is the hero we need.
[time=117] "Down throughout the ages, through the chronicles of time, man has raised up images in the
[time=129] chambers of his mind.
[time=133] He has worshiped golden idols of jewels and precious stones, but of all their earthly
[time=143] splendor, they were just a lifeless form.
[time=149] Divinely God had planned it, and they had no choice but one.
[time=157] Our end authority was revealed through Christ's son.
[time=163] Jesus came as our deliverer to raise the fallen soul.
[time=170] He is reigning now, victorious as our conqueror and the Lord.
[time=178] He is all the hero I need.
[time=185] He stands alone and challenged, he conquered death for me, and he there shall be my king
[time=202] forever, for he's all the hero I need.
[time=210] He wears the scars of battle on his head, his feet and hands from a war, but to determine
[time=221] who would own the souls of man, yet his touch is ever gentle.
[time=228] He loves with tender care, in his faithful arms he rescues me when I cry for help he
[time=238] is there, he is all the hero I need, so that he's all the hero I need.
[time=254] He stands alone and challenged, he conquered death for me, and he there shall be my king
[time=266] forever, for he's all the hero I need.
[time=274] Many rise to greatness, but their end remains for grave.
[time=281] Jesus Christ is the Lord of all, let the saints of God proclaim.
[time=292] He is all the hero I need, and he there shall be my king forever, for he's all the hero I
[time=304] need.
[time=305] He stands alone and challenged, he conquered death for me, and he there shall be my king
[time=318] forever, for he's all the hero I need, yes he's all the hero I need.
[time=334] Amen, thank you Becky.
[time=349] One of the advantages we have of having two services is hearing the songs a couple times and in the rehearsal because there is so much, so many of the songs, but the most important
[time=360] part of that line is that Jesus Christ lives forever, he's the hero that we need, he's
[time=366] the guide, he's our sustainer, he's our shepherd, he's our friend, and he is the flame of freedom
[time=373] that we hold high in just a few days we'll be talking about the celebration of our country's freedom, and as we think of that and as we get ready for the patriotic panorama we also think about the freedom that we have in Christ, how important it is to hold that flame of freedom high, Jesus indeed makes us free.
[time=412] Will one light make a difference in this world, can a lonely light chase the night I wonder,
[time=425] can one voice crying out be heard, will they ever hear my simple words, I wonder the touts
[time=439] that we are feeling I have known, but I've learned through all the years, it is not by
[time=450] might, it is not by power, it is God alone, just bring the name of Jesus, light a candle
[time=469] in the night, just bring the name of Jesus, here's darkness with his light, hold the
[time=491] flame of freedom high, as they are to one another, keep it burning bright, hold the
[time=504] flame of freedom high, till all world can see, it's shining out for me, hold the flame
[time=518] of freedom high, there is no light without his light, Jesus
[time=537] so wide, the light of the world, hold the flame of freedom high, as they are to one
[time=552] another, keep it burning bright, hold the flame of freedom high, till all world can
[time=566] see, it's shining out for me, hold the flame of freedom high, hold the flame of freedom
[time=588] well hello and welcome to the Bible hour today, I think I need to begin this insert by apologizing
[time=607] for saying we have such great weather, it seems that in Indiana when you say something a little bit delayed you're going to get caught because the weather has changed in the last three or four days from some 90 degrees down to 60 degrees, even 40 degrees I think last
[time=622] night so we certainly have a change of weather here but we have a warm welcome for all of you that watch the Bible hour every week and we're glad that you stay tuned and watch it on a regular basis.
[time=634] Our pastor Russell Moore is on vacation right now, he's in California, he'll be speaking and to a couple of assemblies and having some well deserved rest time and so he'll be gone
[time=644] from us today.
[time=645] I want to continue to tell you about our summer celebration that happens on Wednesday evenings here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, on July 1 we'll have Dr. Paul Dixon, Dr. Dixon
[time=656] is the president of Cedarville College in Cedarville, Ohio, he's been at our church a number of times, he's an outstanding speaker, I hope that you can join us for that event on Wednesday evening July 1st and then if you're watching in Fort Wayne you still have time
[time=671] to make plans to come to the Patriotic Panorama Celebrate America, it's on Sunday June 28th
[time=678] at 4 p.m.
[time=679] We hope that you can come and join with us as we celebrate the good news that God has honored this country, we're thankful for that and we're thankful for our heritage in Christ too, as we sing songs not only about America but about the wonderful salvation that we have
[time=695] in Jesus Christ.
[time=697] Every event during that time will be a special gospel section where not only the Black Hawk choir will be singing but we will be joining with the Calvary Chapel choir from Fort Wayne,
[time=707] Indiana, a fine choir from downtown and we just are excited about that opportunity to sing with them, that's an exciting day on Sunday June 28th at 4 p.m.
[time=719] You just heard Brian Losen sing one of the songs it's entitled "Hold the Flame of Freedom High" while we are thankful for America, that song certainly has the theme of holding the flame of Jesus Christ the Savior of the world high so that the whole world can see it.
[time=736] I want to tell you just a little bit about our speaker for today, it's Tim Teder, Tim is our associate pastor, we really appreciate his ministry to young people, he has a very very active summer as he's taking junior hires to camp and I think right now after this telecast
[time=753] he'll be going with the senior high on a rafting trip to Virginia as a great program for young
[time=759] people, if you have young people in your home and they're kind of bored with the summer you might have them check out the youth ministries, the turnpoint ministries it's called at Black Hawk and you can call the church for further information about all the youth activities that are taking place under the direction of Tim Teder, he'll be speaking to us in just a few minutes.
[time=778] I've been amazed at the number of people that have written in for Bible character cards, we just have two more times that we're going to announce these cards, there are 72 cards in the pack and we'd like to have you receive them, they're biblical characters, pictures of the characters and then a brief description about their history and their place in the
[time=800] Bible.
[time=801] So you can receive these Bible character cards by writing to the Bible hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=813] Once again that's the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=822] We told you last week that we were temporarily out of stock, but that stock has come in now,
[time=828] so as soon as you write our Secretary-Margmeade we'll get these cards in the mail to you so that you can use them with your children and grandchildren throughout the summer.
[time=838] We're going to go back to the live portion of our program now as we enjoy the ministry of music of Brian Losen and then the message from our Associate Pastor, Youth Pastor, Tim
[time=848] Teder.
[time=849] I hope that you'll stay tuned with us for the remainder of the Bible hour.
[time=863] [MUSIC]
[time=886] There are watercolor ponies on my refrigerator door.
[time=896] And the shape of something I don't really recognize.
[time=904] Brushed with careful little fingers and put proudly on display, a reminder to us all of
[time=918] how time flies.
[time=927] Names an endless mound of laundry and a stairway laced with toys, gives a blow-by-blow reminder
[time=940] of the war that we fight for their well-being, for their greater understanding, to impart
[time=956] a holy reverence for the Lord.
[time=964] But baby what will we do when it comes back to me and you?
[time=973] They look a little less like little girls every day.
[time=982] Oh, the pleasure of watching the children grow in is fixed with a bitter cup of no-and-the-water
[time=993] color ponies will one day ride away.
[time=1004] And the vision can get so narrow as you view through your tiny world.
[time=1013] And little victories can go by with no flaws.
[time=1022] But in the greater evaluation, as they fly from your nest of love, may they mount up
[time=1032] with wings as eagles for his cause.
[time=1043] Still I wonder, baby, what will we do when it comes back to me and you?
[time=1053] They look a little less like little girls every day.
[time=1062] Oh, the pleasure of watching the children grow in is fixed with a bitter cup of no-and-the-water
[time=1073] color ponies will one day.
[time=1081] One day ride away.
[time=1111] Thank you, Brian.
[time=1115] I've had my share of watercolor ponies on my refrigerator door along with the crayon
[time=1122] monsters and macaroni flowers and all those kinds of things that collect there and go
[time=1129] to close your refrigerator door and half of them fall off.
[time=1131] And usually what I do is gather them up and making sure none of the children are looking at the dispose of them in a proper place, otherwise you end up with so many of them.
[time=1142] You can't handle them.
[time=1143] But I know that there's coming a time when I'll recall those pictures probably with the
[time=1151] degree of sadness.
[time=1152] It may be at a wedding, maybe alongside the bed of a child who's very sick.
[time=1162] I don't know what the occasion will be, but I know I'll look back and remember the watercolor ponies and the pictures and all those memories of the childhood and probably with some longing
[time=1173] to go back and share all that again, because I think that's our nature as parents, children
[time=1180] that we love and that we raise.
[time=1182] You know, as I get older I find myself more introspective, more reflective in regards to my life and to my family.
[time=1191] I wonder what it is I'm passing on to my children.
[time=1194] I wonder what it is I'm passing on to the people that I develop friendships with.
[time=1200] Wonder what it is I'm passing on to the students, the juniors and senior hires that I've worked with for over 13 years.
[time=1207] I begin to think, does my life really have meaning?
[time=1212] I mean I'm going to be 35 this summer.
[time=1214] If you go with the three score and ten, I'm halfway there, folks.
[time=1218] And I just wonder when I leave, do I leave anything worthwhile behind?
[time=1225] And most importantly, as a Christian, do I have the kind of faith that is going to be
[time=1231] remembered, followed, or do I have the kind of faith that's going to be forgotten?
[time=1238] I wonder what kind of thoughts are going through the mind of Moses as he stood overlooking the people of Israel.
[time=1246] I'm going to have chosen him to lead Israelites from their bondage to the Egyptians and led
[time=1255] them to, right up to the border, the edge of the promised land, the spies were sent in to look over the area, they came back with their report, and the people doubted the promises of God.
[time=1265] And you know the story that God judged them by saying, "This generation will not see the land I promised you.
[time=1271] You will wander in the wilderness for 40 years and it will be your children who will enjoy the inheritance." We come to the book of Deuteronomy and that time has passed.
[time=1281] They've wandered and they're about ready to go into the land that God has promised them.
[time=1286] And Moses stands over the people and he gives them a series of addresses.
[time=1290] And I just wonder what was going through his mind as he looked at this people.
[time=1296] This people that at times he wished that he had nothing to do with.
[time=1301] He asked God, "God, why have you given me leadership to such a rebellious, complaining
[time=1307] group of people?" And here they are ready to enter the land of promise.
[time=1310] And I wonder what was going through Moses' mind as he spoke to them.
[time=1315] I think part of what he thought of and part of what his objective may have been and is speaking to them, he was saying to the people, he says, "You're going on and I'm leaving you and I want to make sure that you have a faith that will not be forgotten.
[time=1330] A faith that will be passed on from one generation to the next."
[time=1336] If you turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 6, Moses has already spent time reviewing their
[time=1343] wanderings in the wilderness and some of the events that has taken place.
[time=1347] In chapter 4 he gives them a call to faithfulness to God.
[time=1352] And then later on in that chapter and through chapter 5 he reviews the Decalogue.
[time=1357] He reviews the 10 commands that God has given the nation that summarizes their duty to follow
[time=1365] and obey him.
[time=1368] To obey God.
[time=1370] Then he comes to chapter 6 and listen to the instruction he gives, verse 1, "These are
[time=1376] the commands," Moses says, "the decrees and laws the Lord your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
[time=1385] So that you, your children, and their children after them may fear the Lord your God as long
[time=1392] as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you." What was the hope of Moses' heart?
[time=1400] What was his desire?
[time=1401] Not just to give commands that would be followed by those people that he was addressing, but to give the commands that would be followed not by just this generation, but the generation that followed, the generation that followed after that.
[time=1412] He hoped to see in the life of the Israelites a quality of faith that would not be forgotten.
[time=1420] Wonder if Moses wondered, "You know, as my life mattered, if I made any lasting difference,
[time=1427] have I been able to pass on that quality of faith, a faith that's going to be followed
[time=1433] into the next generation?" And I believe he begins to teach the Israelites to remind them of the qualities of faith that
[time=1441] will be passed on.
[time=1443] And he says a number of things in the next chapters, but I just want to focus on a brief statement, a brief teaching, just a part of this that Moses gives in Deuteronomy chapter 6 verses 4 through 9.
[time=1455] And in this, I think we see at least a summary of the kind of qualities of an unforgettable faith.
[time=1460] Would you read it with me, beginning at verse 4 of Deuteronomy chapter 6, Moses declares,
[time=1467] "Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=1471] Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
[time=1477] These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts.
[time=1480] Impress them on your children.
[time=1482] Talk about them when you sit at home, when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
[time=1487] Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads.
[time=1491] Break them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates."
[time=1498] This passage among the Jewish people is known as the Shema, comes from the Hebrew word here,
[time=1504] which is the first word that we read.
[time=1507] Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=1514] It is a passage that is often repeated by the Jewish people.
[time=1518] In fact, Orthodox Jews repeat this passage almost daily as a prayer, as a recitation to
[time=1524] God because of its truthfulness.
[time=1530] I believe what Moses is teaching here, he is telling us that we can help draw the next generation to faithfulness by building these qualities of unforgettable faith into our lives.
[time=1542] We don't drive them to faithfulness.
[time=1544] We don't command them to faithfulness, but we can draw them to faithfulness when these qualities of unforgettable faith are evident in our life.
[time=1553] What are the qualities of the unforgettable faith?
[time=1555] In these verses, I would just identify three things.
[time=1559] The qualities of a faith that will not be forgotten is first of all a faith that is based on truth, secondly, it is a faith that is driven by passion, and thirdly, it is a faith
[time=1569] that is lived with genuineness.
[time=1574] It is a faith that is based on truth, verse 4.
[time=1579] The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=1584] Moses tells the people two things in regards to God here.
[time=1588] The Lord is our God, and the Lord is one God.
[time=1592] The Lord is a personal God.
[time=1594] The Lord God that we serve is a God who has made a covenant with you.
[time=1599] Out of all the nations of the world, what did God choose to do?
[time=1601] God chose to take a man, Abraham, and make a covenant and a promise with him that from
[time=1608] him a nation would come that would be the people of God.
[time=1614] Moses reminds the people, "This God you serve is your God.
[time=1617] You have a covenant.
[time=1618] He is a personal God who cares and loves for you." Not only that, the Lord is one God.
[time=1625] He is the only God.
[time=1628] He is unique.
[time=1629] This was a sharp contrast in comparison to the polytheism of the nations that surrounded
[time=1635] the Israelites, who believed in many different gods.
[time=1639] Moses said, "The God you worship is one God.
[time=1640] He is the one true God." You're going to have a faith that's not forgotten.
[time=1644] Make sure that your faith is based on truth.
[time=1648] Now I'm sure that the nations that surrounded Israel looked on their religion, looked on their God, and they must have thought that was rather narrow-minded to not only believe in just one God, but to say that our one God is the only God.
[time=1660] Your God's don't matter.
[time=1661] ours is the only one that really counts, but that's what Moses called the people to remember.
[time=1667] The Lord is our God.
[time=1668] The Lord is one God, and over and over again as we read the story of the people going in and conquering the land, and as they established a kingdom, we see over and over how God shows
[time=1681] Himself to be the one true God, as it's tested over and over again, perhaps one of the most
[time=1687] dramatic tests we find is when God, through His prophet Elijah, confronts the prophets
[time=1696] of Baal, remember that in 1 Kings chapter 18?
[time=1699] The people at this time, for the most part is a nation, a turd against God.
[time=1702] They started focusing on other gods, and so Elijah called these other false prophets
[time=1710] to the test, and I think there were some 450 prophets of Baal that were called to Mount Carmel, and Elijah said, I'll tell you what, you want to find out who really is the true God?
[time=1720] Well, then you offer a sacrifice.
[time=1721] We've got two bulls here.
[time=1723] You take one bull, you offer it as a sacrifice to your God, and you pray to your God to accept this sacrifice, and so we have the story in its ... I mean, if we were there, it would almost be humorous.
[time=1734] To see these prophets of Baal taking on the challenge, putting this bull on the altar, and all morning they begin to chant, hear us, O Baal, hear us, answer our plea, answer
[time=1744] our prayer, hoping that somehow Baal will do something to sacrifice to show that he's the real God, all morning, nothing happens.
[time=1753] Says by mid-day Elijah, begin to kind of taunt these false prophets, saying things like,
[time=1760] well, you know, maybe your God's a little busy, or maybe he's sleeping, perhaps you should shout a little louder, try to wake him up, and so they did, they went to a great year frenzy, and it says they begin cutting themselves and dancing around, trying to awaken this God of Baal, nothing happened all day long.
[time=1774] Elijah said, it's enough, it's my turn now.
[time=1779] And the whole story of how he constructed this altar before God, in order that four great pictures of water be brought and dumped over the altar and the wood and the bull on top
[time=1790] so that everything was soaked, and he said, do it again, four more pictures of water poured over the sacrifice, do it one more time, 12 large pictures of water so that everything was soaked in the water, even filled the trench around the altar, and then Elijah simply
[time=1805] said a prayer to God that said, prove yourself to be God to these people, and the fire came
[time=1811] down, it says it consumed not only the sacrifice, but the wood and the stone and the water and the dirt and everything, I mean, that was some show God proved himself to be the one and only God.
[time=1820] And I don't know about you, but sometimes I wish God did the same thing in the same way today, you know.
[time=1824] I mean, sometimes I just, I would like to prove something to some people, maybe it's a little bit of pride, but when that person that stands there and kind of challenges what you believe, they're critical of you, don't you just kind of want to say, would you step back about eight feet or so?
[time=1837] I've got a little prayer, I'd like to, oh God, you know, well the fact is some of the
[time=1844] days coming when every knee will bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, that there is one God, whether they recognize it now or not, they'll recognize the truth.
[time=1853] But if we want a faith that is passed on to the next generation, it needs to be based on truth, otherwise it's meaningless, it's empty.
[time=1861] Believe in the God who is our God, believe in the God who is one God.
[time=1866] Moses goes on to say, you want a faith that will not be forgotten, needs to be a faith that is driven by passion, faith that is driven by passion.
[time=1875] In verse five, love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength.
[time=1882] Jonathan In other words, the great theologian said that seeking after God is the main business of the Christian life, I think that's what I mean by passion, the seeking after God.
[time=1892] I'm not talking about feeling, I'm not talking so much about emotion as I'm talking about a single mindedness that drives me to pursue one goal, that's the passion, that's what
[time=1902] our faith ought to be.
[time=1903] It's about a spring from inside of us, that single mindedness as we pursue God.
[time=1912] We see it in other areas when someone has that kind of single mindedness to a particular sport, we would say that person might, he really has a passion for basketball or baseball or whatever.
[time=1922] Someone who gives himself to their work because they have this goal of whatever is prestige
[time=1928] or financial gain or security or to be the best at their job and we see themselves giving themselves to it, we say, man that person has a passion for their work.
[time=1939] We describe relationships sometimes in terms of the passion of relationship as one person pursues another and I can remember early in my college days as a sophomore standing up
[time=1950] in front of a group of freshmen as I was leading them in singing and noticing in the second row this blonde haired beauty.
[time=1958] Who I was sure someday was going to be my wife and she ended up being my wife.
[time=1963] I thought that for about a dozen other women previously but this time it was the real thing.
[time=1971] But you know my passion was to pursue Connie.
[time=1975] I wanted to get to know her.
[time=1977] That single minded direction that drives us to a goal and that's the kind of faith
[time=1983] we ought to have.
[time=1984] That's come from our heart, that single minded direction, it's passion driven, it comes from inside.
[time=1990] You know contemporary faith in our church today it tends to be performance driven, not passion driven.
[time=1996] We focus on the externals, we focus on the performance, the duty, the work.
[time=2002] We know that we're saved by grace, by faith but somehow we think that now it's kind of left up to us to really do the work of the Christian life and so we have to do the right things.
[time=2014] Folks I really believe that from Old Testament on what God was pleased with was a Christian life that grew out of a passionate heart, a heart of passion for God.
[time=2024] Not just trying to do the right things but having a right heart that resulted in a right
[time=2030] life.
[time=2031] But we tend to focus on the external instead of the internal.
[time=2035] We tend to be performance oriented.
[time=2037] We work from the outside in, we think that I'll do the right things so I can become the right person.
[time=2043] When it ought to be no, I've become the right person.
[time=2047] God has made me the right person so that I do the right things.
[time=2053] Real Christianity works from the inside out.
[time=2056] But you know what, performance is easier to measure isn't it than passion?
[time=2060] It's easier to put a handle on performance whether we're doing that or not than to go in and to measure whether we have a passion for God in our hearts.
[time=2068] How do you measure that?
[time=2071] And that was the trap the Pharisees fell into.
[time=2074] God had given a number of commands and some of them were a little bit too ambiguous.
[time=2083] God gave the command that remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy, you know you work for six days on the seventh day you rest.
[time=2088] Okay, I mean that's the heart of God, that's what he required, that's what he wanted in his people.
[time=2093] But how do you measure that?
[time=2094] How do you know whether someone is really observing and keeping holy and honoring the
[time=2100] Sabbath day?
[time=2101] And so they began to add all these little descriptions and measurements of how you could know whether you were obeying the law of God.
[time=2108] And you know what may be initially some of those were helpful to people.
[time=2112] But what happened is they began to add on all these measurements, the measurements became the law.
[time=2117] The measurements became the standard.
[time=2119] People lost focus of what God desired instead focused on all these little measurements and the externals of performance.
[time=2127] So now how do we know that we've kept the Sabbath day, will you count your steps, you can only walk so far on the Sabbath day or else you violated the command.
[time=2135] That was all things that man added because we tend, it's so much easier to measure those things and to measure the passion, the heart, the obedience of the heart.
[time=2144] And Jesus nailed the Pharisees for that kind of legalism.
[time=2149] We tend to maybe fall on the same kind of trap.
[time=2152] I mean we believe that Sunday's ought to be special, it was a day that the early Christians came together to observe and to worship, to remember the resurrection of the Lord, it was a unique day for them.
[time=2162] Some held it in a certain kind of esteem, others practice it in a different way.
[time=2167] But we come away thinking well it ought to be a unique day, it ought to be a special day, it ought to be maybe have the same holiness as the Sabbath day had in the Old Testament.
[time=2177] Well how can it be that for us?
[time=2178] And some may decide well that means that I have six days to take care of business and duty, maybe on the seventh I should not mow my lawn.
[time=2186] Maybe on Sunday I shouldn't mow my grass.
[time=2189] That's how I am going to try to keep this day unique and focused on God.
[time=2195] And because I make that decision for myself and my family and it's right and proper for me to do, but what happens in a church or in a community where standards like that become
[time=2206] the norm, then we begin measuring other people by whether or not they mow the lawn on Sunday.
[time=2211] That becomes the standard and we forget the whole point of the deal when we start looking at all the externals.
[time=2217] Do you do that or not?
[time=2218] That's how we measure people's spirituality instead of it but it's easier to do that isn't it?
[time=2223] Rather than where is my heart?
[time=2225] And you know what it's easier to change the outside than it is to change the inside.
[time=2234] The Pharisees were diligent in being obedient on the outside but Jesus said hey you know what you're trying to clean the outside of the cup but the inside is filthy.
[time=2243] You know where you start?
[time=2244] You start on the inside of the cup.
[time=2246] You clean that first and then the outside is clean as well.
[time=2248] He wasn't saying that the externals are necessarily wrong but when you give attention to that as your primary focus, God's not pleased with it.
[time=2256] Change should come from the inside out.
[time=2257] Moses said, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength." Our problem is we want techniques that will help us be successful in the spiritual life.
[time=2269] We're not so concerned about changed heart or changed character.
[time=2271] We just want to know what things do I have to do to be successful in my Christian life.
[time=2275] And so we look for techniques, we look for performance that we can do that will make us spiritually successful.
[time=2281] And when that becomes our mindset, we fall into the trap of approaching even scripture the wrong way.
[time=2286] For example, let's say we become frustrated with our prayer life and we want to develop a deep prayer life.
[time=2292] We're not satisfied with where our prayer life is and so we go to the gospels to examine
[time=2298] the life of Christ to see how he prayed.
[time=2302] Now we can do one of two things.
[time=2303] We can look at the life of Christ to try to understand his passion and his heart and to desire that same for ourselves, which would be proper to do, or we can go to life of Christ and try to look at his performance and his techniques to try to learn what are the things that we should do in order to be successful in our Christian life.
[time=2319] And if we did that in regards to prayer, we might come away thinking that, well, Luke chapter 5, it says that Jesus often withdrew to lonely places to pray.
[time=2329] So we would think, well, to have a successful prayer life, I've got to get into a lonely place.
[time=2334] So we look for a lonely place.
[time=2335] And we try this spot in the next until we find a place where we feel a little lonely and no one's around and then we spend some time in prayer.
[time=2341] But you know, after a while, if it's just been outward focus, it doesn't satisfy and we wonder there must be something more.
[time=2346] We go back and we find in Mark chapter 6, it says he went up to a mountain to pray.
[time=2351] So we look around Indiana and we're a little frustrated.
[time=2354] Maybe we have to take a little trip, a little vacation somewhere.
[time=2357] We find a mountain, we go up in the mountain and we spend some time in prayer.
[time=2360] And you know what?
[time=2361] Something just still isn't right.
[time=2363] We go back to the gospel and it says Jesus spent the night in prayer.
[time=2367] So we go to the mountain and we spend all night praying when it comes the next morning, we're tired.
[time=2373] Because when it's only performance, when it's just the works and it hasn't come from the heart, it's not going to get us anywhere.
[time=2379] And out of great frustration, we think there must be something Jesus did that we're missing and we finally find in Luke 22 when it says Jesus, when he prayed, sweat drops of blood.
[time=2389] And we try to, well how can we do that?
[time=2390] And I mean, see how ridiculous it gets to try to follow performance as a technique to living a spiritual life.
[time=2397] Performance flows out of our passion, out of our heart.
[time=2402] Moses says you want a faith that will not be forgotten, it needs to be a faith that's based on truth, it needs to be a faith that's driven by passion.
[time=2407] And I question, I ask myself, and I've been asking other people this recently, I've been
[time=2413] frustrated, you know, I find those times a frustration in my life when I just feel like I'm doing all the things, but it's just dry.
[time=2422] Maybe it's Bible study, maybe it's prayer, maybe it's sharing Christ with someone, maybe it's teaching, all those things are good, but I just feel like, you know, isn't there supposed to, where's the joy of the Christian life?
[time=2431] I mean, where's that life abundantly that Jesus promised me?
[time=2435] It just seems like I'm like everybody else.
[time=2437] I'm just doing all the right things, but when I just stop and I'm quiet, it's not satisfying me.
[time=2444] And I realize in those times when I'm honest with myself, I find that I tend to be living my Christian life on a performance-driven basis, and my heart is somewhere else.
[time=2460] I've lost the passion.
[time=2462] And I want to do the things for the right reasons.
[time=2464] I want my Christian life to be flowing from the inside out, not just to be something that's on the surface.
[time=2470] And so I begin asking people, I said, "What is it in your life that drives you back to that passion to God?" I've asked students that ask the staff that I work with that.
[time=2478] I've tried to just be quiet in my own life and try to evaluate my own life.
[time=2482] What has it been the things that have driven me back to passion towards God?
[time=2486] Trying to understand through Scripture, what are the things that bring passion to God?
[time=2490] And I don't think I have all the answers.
[time=2492] But I think I'm learning.
[time=2494] Let me just pass on a few thoughts.
[time=2497] How do I get a heart of passion?
[time=2500] First of all, I believe this.
[time=2501] Heart of passion comes from God.
[time=2503] I cannot create a heart of passion for godliness in my life, for righteousness, for doing the right thing.
[time=2509] That just doesn't come.
[time=2510] In fact, the Bible tells me that I run away from God, that in myself, before God took hold of me, I might have desired good things.
[time=2519] I might have desired morality.
[time=2520] I might have desired a lot of things that would be favorable, but I didn't desire God.
[time=2524] I want to do things my own way.
[time=2527] Heart of passion from God comes because God gives it to me.
[time=2531] That is a work of grace of God.
[time=2532] I don't earn it.
[time=2533] I don't deserve it.
[time=2534] God gives it to me.
[time=2535] It says in Ezekiel chapter 36, "The promised God made to his people.
[time=2538] He says, 'I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you.
[time=2541] I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
[time=2545] And I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.'" God changed their heart.
[time=2554] Saint Corinthians 5 is described as being a new creation.
[time=2556] God recreates us inside, and in Philippians chapter 2, it says that it is God who works in us to will the passion of the heart and to act according to his good pleasure.
[time=2568] God gives us the passion of the heart, and if you're like most of us, if you can remember back when you first became a Christian, the passion of God was probably most evident, or at least one of the times most evident in your life was at that time, when the passion
[time=2582] of God was real, I mean it's just evident.
[time=2585] I believe this.
[time=2586] I believe that in life of every Christian that passion doesn't change.
[time=2589] I believe at the very heart of who we are as Christian, because God has recreated us, that passion remains, that objective, that direction towards God in this remains at the core of who I am as a child of God.
[time=2601] You know, in my life, things get in the way of that.
[time=2608] I turn my attention to other things.
[time=2612] My focus changes, and when that happens, things begin to cover over that passion.
[time=2618] It's still there, but I don't sense it.
[time=2622] I don't recognize it.
[time=2624] In fact, it may come to the point where I actually forget that it exists, but I believe
[time=2631] in the heart of every true believer, it remains, it doesn't go away.
[time=2636] So I ask people, you know, what is it that brings that passion back and people have suggested these things?
[time=2641] I think they're good.
[time=2642] I think they're true.
[time=2643] People have said, you know what brings that passion back is remembering what God has done.
[time=2649] Taking time to remember what God has done, because my passion comes because God first
[time=2655] had a passion for me.
[time=2659] If I take time to meditate and reflect on the work of God, and as I reflect on that,
[time=2665] I remember what God has done in my heart.
[time=2667] Others have said, and this is true in my life, how do I renew that passion for God by spending
[time=2673] time with God?
[time=2675] I need to have time when I can just get alone to focus on who I am and what God is doing
[time=2683] in me.
[time=2685] I need that time to be away, I need that time, whether it's spending time in the Word or prayer or worship or just contemplating in thinking, I need that.
[time=2695] And when I neglect that in my life, that passion tends to get covered up.
[time=2700] I mean, folks, listen, how many times did Jesus go away to be by himself and spend time with God the Father, to be alone?
[time=2706] He constantly did that, and if Jesus did that, I certainly need that in my life.
[time=2713] I need the time alone, and that means I have to change my schedule of life because I'm just too busy.
[time=2720] But if I don't do that, that sense of passion tends to leave me.
[time=2724] Others have suggested too that spending time with people of passion encourages the passion in my own life, and that is certainly true.
[time=2730] Don't you know people that when you're around them, it's not what they do so much as the quality of their life, the character of their life that draws you to want to be like that?
[time=2738] Have you met people like that, Christians like that, and you're around them?
[time=2741] And just to quality their life, you go away, not with a sense of guilt of, boy, you know, I don't have my devotions like she has her devotions, or I don't do all these disciplines
[time=2752] like so and so.
[time=2753] No, we go away with a sense of refreshment and challenge of the quality, the character of their life, that draws us to want to be like that.
[time=2761] We need to be around people like that, so that passion is stirred up in us.
[time=2768] If we have a faith that's not forgotten, we have to have a faith that is driven by passion.
[time=2775] And I think Moses also tells the people, if you have a faith that's not forgotten, you need to have a faith that is lived with genuineness verses six through nine.
[time=2786] He tells them three things, a genuine faith I think is described in these verses by a faith that welcomes the Word of God genuinely, not superficially.
[time=2796] It's a faith that teaches the truth of God genuinely, not superficially.
[time=2808] It says in verse six, "These commands that I give you today are to be upon your heart.
[time=2814] Welcome the Word of God genuinely." Not just superficially, not just on the surface, but you are to embrace the Word of God deeply.
[time=2822] It is to be in you, it is to be on your heart.
[time=2826] Too often we approach the Word of God with the attitude, "Well, I know this is good for me, so I guess I better do it."
[time=2835] If the only reason we're coming to the Word of God is because, well, somehow it must be good for me, so I'm going to do it.
[time=2842] Does that last very long for you?
[time=2845] When I was on swim team, I had a hard time finding a diet that would give me the right
[time=2852] kind of energy and feed me on what I thought would be the right way and yet wouldn't make me sick when I'd go out and actually swim laps.
[time=2860] I came up with a concoction finally, and basically was taking a glass of milk and cracking three
[time=2868] raw eggs into the glass of milk, and once in a while I'd stir in a little ice cream to cover up flavor, but I'd just stir this thing up, and I don't know if it was that good.
[time=2877] I just thought it must be good for me, but I would drink that every morning and it didn't taste good, it didn't feel good, and it was that kind of slimy blandness that goes down your throat.
[time=2891] My approach to that drink every morning was I'm going to do this because it must be good for me, but I'll tell you, the first opportunity I had not do that anymore, I quit doing it.
[time=2902] It certainly was not a joy of my life to look forward to that, and sometimes the word of God, we think it's like swallowing raw eggs, that must be good for me, so I'll endure it, I'll do it, I'll try to build this discipline into my life, but it's not really what I have a passion for doing.
[time=2921] See Moses told the people, he says, "First love the Lord your God, and then take his word into your heart deeply." I would imagine that among most Christians, probably one of the most frustrating aspects of their life is their inability to develop a meaningful, regular interaction with the
[time=2941] word of God.
[time=2945] We try a method and it works for a while, and then we quit, or we become part of a group that challenges us towards Bible study and we've maybe become accountable to a group of people, and as long as that accountability is there, we kind of stay with it, but when the accountability leaves and our discipline leaves.
[time=2964] Or maybe we sit under a message or a lesson or read a book that stirs up the guilt, because we know we're not spending the time in the word of God that we should, and so we're driven by guilt for a while, but after we don't feel guilty anymore, when that doesn't drive us, we don't study the word of God anymore.
[time=2981] When my Bible study becomes the goal, then I am performance driven.
[time=2988] When I think in my Christian life, for success in my Christian life is what I need.
[time=2991] I need to study the word of God every day.
[time=2993] When that becomes the goal of my life, I will fail.
[time=2995] I fail every time.
[time=2997] It doesn't last.
[time=3001] When Bible study becomes performance driven, I begin to think that I expect my Bible study
[time=3007] to do something for me.
[time=3008] That's how I approach the word of God.
[time=3010] I'm afraid I'll forfeit God's blessing, perhaps, if I don't do my Bible study.
[time=3014] You know, I didn't have time to get in the word today, my day's ruined.
[time=3019] That's performance driven.
[time=3020] I'm expecting to get something out of what I do.
[time=3024] When my Bible study is the goal, when it's performance driven, I measure my spiritual condition on the basis of the time I've spent in God's word.
[time=3033] Bible study becomes a joyless habit, and I quit.
[time=3036] It doesn't last that long.
[time=3038] Now, I'm not trying to say that Bible study, you shouldn't do it.
[time=3041] I'm not trying to say that a daily consistent habit of Bible study is wrong.
[time=3046] All I'm saying is that when it is the goal, just like any other spiritual discipline, when this becomes the goal, we've gotten things out of whack.
[time=3054] Moses said, "First of all, love the Lord your God with everything you've got, and then do these things." Performance comes out of passion.
[time=3062] What God has been teaching me out of this frustration of trying to do the spiritual disciplines and never feeling like it's getting me anywhere, and I end up just quitting.
[time=3069] What has been teaching me is, as you know, you've got your focus wrong.
[time=3073] That's not your objective.
[time=3074] That is not your goal.
[time=3075] Your goal is me.
[time=3077] Your goal is a passion for God.
[time=3081] Your goal is to know God, your goal is to draw close to God, your goal is to have a heart of love for God, and if that is my goal, if that is sincerely my goal, if I desire more than anything else to have a passion for God, to draw close for God, and by any means to make that happen, to have that happen in my life, you know what?
[time=3101] This is going to happen, not because I have to do it, because of what I think will come out of it, but because this is a means by which I know God.
[time=3110] When my goal is passion for God, then I find that I share Christ not with people, not because it's my duty, and I have to do it, and I'll feel guilty if I don't.
[time=3118] But I share God with others because as I draw close to Him and I understand and recognize
[time=3124] the love He has for me, how can I help but share that with other people?
[time=3129] I spend time in prayer, not because it's my duty to do it, because my day will be ruined if I don't.
[time=3135] I spend time in prayer because I need that if I'm going to develop a passionate relationship with God.
[time=3141] All those things become natural results, and natural means for realizing my objective,
[time=3148] drawing close to God.
[time=3150] The performance grows out of the passion.
[time=3155] Moses said, "Welcome the word of God genuinely, not superficially." He also says in verse 7, he tells the people of Israel that they are to teach the truth
[time=3166] of God.
[time=3167] In the New American Standard, it says to teach these things diligently to your children.
[time=3171] In the NIV, it says it's you need to impress them on your children.
[time=3178] Suddenly teach the truth of God.
[time=3181] Now we can do that superficially as well.
[time=3183] In our homes, to our children, a superficial teaching the word of God would be when we'd simply rely on a once a week or even once a day gathering around the table and opening our daily bread and whatever we just choose to read, and you read that and that becomes
[time=3200] your family devotions.
[time=3203] Now I'm not saying that's bad, that may be very good, may be very desirable, but when that is the objective, we've lost sight of the real purpose.
[time=3211] When that is the objective, your family devotions become dry, they become boring, and you'll
[time=3217] probably quit.
[time=3220] When we teach the word of God, when that springs from our passion, from God as a parent, when
[time=3228] we have a passion for God, out of that we'll spring a natural teaching for God.
[time=3233] Here in this passage it says, "Talk about them when you sit at home, when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up." I see here that he's telling parents, "There's a purpose in what you're doing.
[time=3243] You want the truth to be understood by the next generation.
[time=3246] You impress them, you teach these things to your children." Understand you have a purpose in doing this.
[time=3252] It's not just a dude, you have to perform, there's a purpose behind it.
[time=3255] The story of a man walking down the street came to the corner and the construction was
[time=3261] taking place on the corner.
[time=3263] They're working side-by-side with three men, apparently doing the same job.
[time=3270] The man asked the three construction workers, "What are you guys doing?" The first one replied rather a matter of fact, "Well, I'm just laying bricks."
[time=3280] The other one said, "I'm building a wall." The third sat up responded proudly, "I'm laying a great cathedral."
[time=3289] It's a different perspective.
[time=3293] A different understanding of their purpose.
[time=3295] If we could go into a Christian home today and we might ask parents, "Why are you doing what you're doing in this home?" One parent may say, "Well, I'm just trying to survive." Another may say, "Well, I'm trying to provide what's best for my family." I think it's the parent who best understands who is able to reply, "I am raising children." There's a purpose behind what we do.
[time=3317] We don't just do family devotions to do them.
[time=3319] In fact, you may not even do family devotions.
[time=3322] I'll make a confession here.
[time=3324] The Tedder family, at this time with our four children, we do not have that time when we sit down with our four kids at a meal time and have family devotions.
[time=3332] I have parents that say, "How can I develop family devotions in our home?" I said, "Well, that may be good for you, but what's more important where you ought to start is make sure that in your own life as a parent you're developing a passion for God and that you're able to communicate to that to your children." Naturally, you're able to do it in every circumstance of life.
[time=3356] Let God be teaching you through His Word and find opportunities just in conversation.
[time=3360] Share with your kids.
[time=3361] You know what?
[time=3362] I just read this in God's Word and this is how He's been changing my life.
[time=3365] That's going to do more to teach your children than trying to sit them down and force them to listen to a five minute speech every week or every day.
[time=3373] Now the other may grow out of the first.
[time=3375] You may have meaningful, significant family devotion times, but that will be meaningful and significant if it grows out of the right kind of heart.
[time=3382] I encourage parents to develop your passion for God and find ways of communicating that to your children.
[time=3387] I was riding my bikes with my kids the other just yesterday and we were riding down the road and for some reason the subject of weddings came up.
[time=3397] My kids asked me, "You know Dad, when people get married do they have to invite their parents?"
[time=3408] I really enjoyed the ministry of music today and I hope that you did too.
[time=3412] We appreciate our musicians, Becky Wollman and Brian Lowson and our sanctuary choir for
[time=3418] their ministry to us today.
[time=3420] The message was from our associate pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=3424] As a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3428] Let's take a moment right now before we close and pray this prayer together.
[time=3433] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I need you as my Savior.
[time=3439] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3444] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3447] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3452] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance, to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
