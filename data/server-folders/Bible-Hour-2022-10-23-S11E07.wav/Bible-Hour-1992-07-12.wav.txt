[time=914] My favorite preacher is the person that God has placed me under as my pastor/teacher.
[time=929] I decided that a lot of years ago, that one time Dave Jeremiah was my favorite preacher, and Rick was my favorite preacher, and now Russell is my favorite preacher.
[time=938] I believe they have for me what God wants me to hear as a man in my family.
[time=944] They are able to deliver the message that God wants me to hear, and so they are my favorite.
[time=950] But I get to choose number two, and of all the people in the world that I get a chance
[time=956] to hear, Ron Scarf is one of those people that I just love to hear preach.
[time=962] And one of the reasons that I enjoy him so much is that I have had opportunity to observe
[time=968] what he's done in his family.
[time=971] Roslyn and Jocelyn are wonderful young women, and Ron and Evangeline have given themselves
[time=977] to serving the Lord and making their priorities right so that they have these two fine young ladies as evidence of the fact that they've been walking with God.
[time=987] And I can't wait to hear him preach again this morning to have him come right from our own church and fill our pulpit.
[time=992] Let's welcome Ron Scarf.
[time=1005] Thank you, Steve, for those kind, but I'm sure undeserved words.
[time=1009] And I would like to say that it indeed is a joy for me to be able to occupy this pulpit
[time=1015] again, and I've had the privilege to do this on several occasions, and it's always a privilege.
[time=1020] I kind of the privilege to be able to participate in the services and to be able to share from the Scriptures.
[time=1027] And if you have your Bibles with you this morning, and if you have them open to the passage that was just read for us from Joshua 23, I want to direct your attention to this chapter.
[time=1037] I want to direct your attention to begin with, to a particular verse.
[time=1041] It's verse 14, where Joshua says to the elders of the nation of Israel on this particular
[time=1047] occasion, he says, "Not one word of all that the Lord has spoken unto you has failed or
[time=1055] come to pass." And this morning I want to speak to you on the subject of the faithfulness of God, and I want to use this text, verse 14, but I want to study it in the context of this chapter.
[time=1066] And I also want to study it in the context of the overall book of Joshua.
[time=1072] Some time ago on national TV, there was a program dealing with a crisis, an ethical crisis
[time=1080] here in America, dealing with the loss of integrity and the styling effects that this is having on the moral foundation of our nation.
[time=1089] And this particular program began by zeroing in on the political world and showed, not
[time=1095] in the case of every politician, but in the case of some politicians at least, that there is a dichotomy between, on the one hand, their rhetoric and their speeches, and on the other hand, their lifestyle.
[time=1107] And then the program drew the attention of the viewer to the business world and showed that many businessmen today have a great amount of pressure placed upon them, incentives to
[time=1117] achieve immediate success, and as a result, they will many times take shortcuts to close
[time=1123] a deal.
[time=1124] And then the program moved on to marriage and the family and pointed out how many of our
[time=1130] young people today are taking vowels pertaining to marriage, and they're saying, "I do.
[time=1135] I do verbally," but as they verbalize those words that in the back of their mind, they are saying, "Maybe if perhaps," and they're qualifying their commitment to their partner,
[time=1147] and as a result, there's a tremendous increase in the divorce rate.
[time=1151] And then the program went on to look at our schools and our colleges and showed how,
[time=1157] in the case of so many students today, that the accepted practice is cheating in homework and in term papers, term projects, and examinations, and showed how our educational system is being
[time=1169] so drastically affected by this kind of ethical practice.
[time=1173] And finally, the concluding part of the program drew the attention of the viewer to the pain
[time=1180] of income tax come April each year and showed how much fraud there is in America today because
[time=1186] of inaccurate reporting and falsifying one's reports pertaining to his or her income tax.
[time=1193] And the result is that the moral foundation of our nation is being slowly destroyed and
[time=1200] there's widespread skepticism in America today.
[time=1203] There's a loss of confidence, a loss of trust in one another in many of our esteemed organizations
[time=1210] and institutions.
[time=1212] And that's a tragic situation, is it not?
[time=1214] I'm sure you would agree with me, but how refreshing it is to turn from that drastic situation to the Scriptures and find, for instance, in Numbers 23 verse 19 that it says
[time=1226] that God is not a man that he should lie.
[time=1230] And in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 18, it says, "It is impossible for God to lie."
[time=1237] And Moses reminds the children of Israel in Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 9.
[time=1241] He says, "I want you to know this as a certain fact and as a certain truth that the Lord your God is the faithful God." Now God's faithfulness is based on his integrity.
[time=1253] Because he is a God of integrity, he is trustworthy and he is reliable.
[time=1258] And that is seen in his faithfulness, his faithfulness to his word and his faithfulness
[time=1264] to his people.
[time=1266] Here we have before us this morning in Joshua chapter 23, the farewell address of Joshua.
[time=1273] And I don't know how it is with you, but I know that I find the last words of esteemed
[time=1279] renowned leaders to be very challenging and provocative.
[time=1283] I think, for instance, of Douglas MacArthur at the end of his brilliant military career as he delivered his farewell address to our Congress.
[time=1292] He referred to himself, as you may recall, as that old soldier who tried to do his duty
[time=1298] as God gave him light and then he concluded with those touching words, and he said to
[time=1304] the Congress, "Goodbye." And it seems as though he faded off then into the lying light.
[time=1311] You know when you look at the life of Moses and the life of Joshua, there are certain parallels.
[time=1316] You'll find, for instance, that both of these men, Moses and Joshua, that they had
[time=1322] the privilege of leading the nation of Israel through a body of water.
[time=1326] Moses led the Israelites to cross the Red Sea, as you will recall.
[time=1331] Joshua led the Israelites to cross the Jordan River.
[time=1334] Both of these men had an exposure to a theophany from God, a dramatic experience when God in
[time=1341] a dynamic way revealed himself to them and said to both of them on different occasions, of course, said to them, "Remove your shoes from off your feet for the ground in which you stand as holy ground." Both of them had the privilege of building altars by which to worship God.
[time=1358] Both of them also wrote words which later were written in a book.
[time=1363] And both of them concluded their careers by delivering farewell addresses.
[time=1368] Moses delivered his farewell address in Deuteronomy chapter 32 and Joshua here in Joshua chapter 23.
[time=1375] Josephus, the great Jewish historian, tells us that Joshua spent forty years in Egypt
[time=1382] and forty years then in the wilderness, and it took him seven years during the time of the conquest so that at the end of Joshua chapter 22, Joshua was approximately 87 years
[time=1393] of age.
[time=1394] We know from the last chapter in Joshua, chapter 24, verse 29 that Joshua now is 110 years
[time=1400] of age, that means there's approximately 23 years that has a lapse between Joshua chapter
[time=1406] 22 and Joshua chapter 23.
[time=1409] And Joshua and all probability delivered this farewell address to the leaders of Israel
[time=1416] at Shiloh.
[time=1418] The text doesn't tell us this, but Shiloh is where the tabernacle was located in an all probability that would be the most suitable location for the delivering of this personal
[time=1428] and this powerful address on the part of Joshua at the end of his brilliant military
[time=1434] career.
[time=1435] Now, there are four words or four concepts that I believe summarize the basic themes
[time=1441] that weave their way through this address.
[time=1444] We have first of all the review and then secondly the responsibility.
[time=1448] Thirdly, we have the recognition and finally we have the reminder and I want you to notice to begin with if you'll turn in this 23rd chapter and looking at verse 3 that Joshua
[time=1460] says to these elders, these officers of this nation, he says, "You have seen all that the
[time=1466] Lord your God has done for you." I want you to notice he says, "You have seen," he doesn't say, "You have heard," and he doesn't say, "You have read," but he says, "You have seen, you've been participants, you've been eyewitnesses, you've been involved in all of the events in recent history."
[time=1485] Recently I heard a soldier interviewed on TV who was involved in the Normandy invasion
[time=1492] in June of 1944 in D-Day in liberating a year and he says, "We were so intensely involved
[time=1500] in the Normandy invasion that it wasn't until later afterwards as we look back that we realized
[time=1506] that at the time we were making history." But he says, "At the time we didn't realize we were making history." And you see that's basically what Joshua is seeking to inculcate in the minds of these elders of Israel at this point.
[time=1520] He wants them to realize that they have been involved in making history and obviously when
[time=1526] he says, "You have seen," this takes the leaders as well as taking us back to the very first chapter in the book of Joshua.
[time=1533] You may recall when this book opens that there are two announcements that are made.
[time=1536] The first announcement that's made is that Moses, the servant of the Lord, is dead.
[time=1541] Moses the leader, the then leader of Israel.
[time=1544] The second announcement that is made is, now that Moses is dead, the Lord says, "Joshua,
[time=1550] you are now my newly appointed leader and replacement for Moses."
[time=1556] And as soon as that announcement is made, then the Lord gives a threefold challenge to Joshua.
[time=1562] And he says, "Joshua, I want you to be strong.
[time=1565] I want you to be steadfast and I want you to be studious.
[time=1568] I want you to be strong to accept the position of leadership.
[time=1572] I want you to be steadfast in attacking the problems pertaining to leadership, the internal problems dealing with the nation of Israel, the problems of apathy and complacency, and the problems that you're going to be faced with and dealing with the Canaanites." And then 30 said, "I want you to be studious." Can you all remember those words in Joshua chapter 1 verse 8?
[time=1593] When the Lord said to Joshua, "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it, for then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success." Obviously, the success and the prosperity that is promised to Joshua is not materialistic in nature, but it is success in terms of carrying out his threefold charge and his threefold
[time=1620] commission.
[time=1621] And that threefold charge was that Joshua was, first of all, to lead Israel across the Jordan.
[time=1627] And then secondly, Joshua and the Israelites were to conquer the enemy.
[time=1632] And there were three campangers, you may recall, there was a central campaign, then there was a southern campaign, and then there was a northern campaign.
[time=1638] And then thirdly, they were to divide the land and then they were to settle in the land.
[time=1643] Those were the three basic charges given to Joshua.
[time=1648] And no doubt Joshua, at this particular point with the children of Israel, as they are located
[time=1654] at a little town seven miles east of the Jordan.
[time=1657] It's a town called Sitem.
[time=1659] No doubt Joshua realizes that he is faced with a formidable task.
[time=1666] And you just think of the logistics that would be involved on his part in mobilizing a nation,
[time=1672] organizing a nation, to take them across the Jordan, and then to conquer all of the Canaanites
[time=1678] and then to settle the land.
[time=1680] You see, as they are located at Sitem, it's one thing for them, seven miles distance from
[time=1687] the Jordan and looking beyond the Jordan to the promised land, it's one thing to contemplate the land.
[time=1692] It's another thing to conquer the land.
[time=1695] It's one thing for them to observe the land, but it's another thing for them to occupy the land.
[time=1700] And it's one thing for them from a distance to see the land, but it's another thing for them to secure the land.
[time=1707] You see, this is what's entailed in what we call the problem of translation.
[time=1711] It's a problem I face, it's a problem you face when we read Scripture, when we study Scripture, we're absorbing Scripture, but do we apply Scripture?
[time=1720] Do we appropriate Scripture so that what we're studying, the truth of God becomes incarnate in my life and incarnate in your life, that God's truth becomes manifest in our lifestyle?
[time=1732] It's one thing to have the task assigned.
[time=1735] It's another thing to have the task achieved, and that's the whole book of Joshua.
[time=1741] It's the book that deals from the assignment of the task to the achievement of the task.
[time=1746] And now here in verse three, Joshua is saying to these elders, after the conquest is over,
[time=1752] and after they're looking back, he's saying this is the time for review, this is the time for reflection.
[time=1758] He says, do you realize what you've been participating in?
[time=1761] How do you account for all of the successes?
[time=1763] How do you account for all of the victories that we have experienced as a nation?
[time=1770] That's the question.
[time=1771] And the answer that he gives here in verse three, he says, I want you to realize it's because the Lord has been with you.
[time=1778] The Lord has been with us.
[time=1780] He is the one who has intervened in our lives.
[time=1783] It is his presence, his providence, it is his power, it is his protection.
[time=1789] He is the one who has been fighting against our enemies.
[time=1793] And this is the reason why now we are in this promised land.
[time=1799] What Joshua is basically saying to these elders is the history that we have been participating in is no common ordinary history.
[time=1809] It's not history that you can explain on the basis of the principle of naturalism.
[time=1814] You can't explain this history on the basis of the scientific principle of cause and effect.
[time=1820] It's because of the involvement of God in our nation and God leading and guiding and
[time=1826] fighting on our behalf.
[time=1828] In other words, Joshua is seeking to open their eyes to realize the significance and
[time=1834] the meaningfulness of these historic events that have been occurring within the recent
[time=1840] past.
[time=1842] You may have heard the story told about the man from Colorado who was used to the mountains
[time=1850] and he moved to Texas and he built a house in Texas and I had a large picture window.
[time=1857] And he looked out his picture window and he says, there's nothing here in Texas to see.
[time=1862] All I see are acres and acres and acres of rangeland, nothing to see here in Texas.
[time=1869] The same time a man from Texas moved to Colorado and he built his house overlooking the mountains and had a large picture window.
[time=1876] He says, here in Colorado there's nothing to see.
[time=1879] He says, the mountains are always getting in my view.
[time=1883] It's just a reminder to us this morning that as humans, our minds are conditioned and trained
[time=1890] and predisposed to see what we want to see and to filter out what we don't want to see.
[time=1897] Anything that does not fit in with our own preconceived ideas and our presuppositions.
[time=1902] And here we have an eye opener, verse three.
[time=1905] Here we have the review to these elders.
[time=1908] Joshua is saying, the Lord has been with you, the Lord has been with us.
[time=1914] It is the Lord who has been fighting for us and this is why today we stand in this land.
[time=1920] And that's secondly I want you to notice that we have in this farewell address what I'd
[time=1928] like to call responsibility in verse 11.
[time=1931] I want you to notice that Joshua says to these same leaders he says, I want you to take diligent
[time=1937] heed to love the Lord your God.
[time=1942] Now God has already given them rest.
[time=1945] You see that in verse two.
[time=1948] The conquest basically is over and the military presence of Israel has been established in
[time=1954] the land.
[time=1956] And yet there is work yet to be done.
[time=1958] There are pockets of resistance and there are mopping up exercises that still have to be taken care of.
[time=1964] But we all know from experience and this is the problem that Joshua was faced with in dealing with these elders that after the initial glow of victory many times it's easy for us
[time=1977] to settle down and to slack off, to lose our enthusiasm, to lose our intensity.
[time=1984] It's very difficult for us to maintain and to retain our original vigor and vision.
[time=1992] And you see this whole farewell address is dealing with the theme of passing on the torch to the next generation.
[time=1998] And Joshua is saying to these elders that if they're going to be effective in passing on the torch, passing on the faith that they themselves have to set the example by loving
[time=2009] the Lord their God and being diligent in this matter of their allegiance and their commitment.
[time=2017] We're told by many sports analysts that the greatest race that was run in the 20th century
[time=2024] here in America took place in 1973 at the Kentucky Derby when Secretariat ran and won
[time=2031] the Kentucky Derby that year and broke the two-minute barrier setting a record in one minute, 59 and two-fifths of a second, a record I think that still stands, but that's
[time=2042] not the only outstanding characteristic of that race.
[time=2045] Every quarter that Secretariat ran in that race, he ran faster than the previous quarter
[time=2051] so that at the end of the race he was running faster than at the beginning of the race.
[time=2056] Now there's a lesson there that applies to me and a lesson that applies to you that so often in terms of our commitment to the Lord and his kingdom that we begin with a great
[time=2066] deal of enthusiasm and zest, but after a few victories and a few successes it's very easy
[time=2074] for us to become apathetic and complacent and subtlety and slacken off and this is the concern here that Joshua has in sharing with these elders.
[time=2085] You may remember that the Lord Jesus said to the church at Ephesus in Revelation chapter 2 verse 4, he said, "I have this against you that you have left, that you have lost
[time=2097] your first love," and I wonder how many of us today have lost the freshness and the
[time=2104] vitality of that first love that we experienced in our encounter with the Lord.
[time=2112] Obviously without love we may have the shell but we won't have the spirit.
[time=2119] We may have the programs but we're not going to have the power.
[time=2123] We may have all of the mechanics but we're not going to have the might.
[time=2127] That's why love is the ground rule, the ground principle.
[time=2133] Now in order for this to make sense to these elders, Joshua tells them in verse 6 that
[time=2142] if they truly love the Lord with diligence, the evidence will be their personal obedience to the Word of God to the law of God.
[time=2153] Man has been so creative that he will always bow to some form of authority.
[time=2160] That's characteristic of man, that's the nature and the essence of man.
[time=2165] And of man does not bow to the authority of God's revelation in his Word, then man is going to seek some other substitute.
[time=2172] He will either bow to some kind of individualistic subjectivism or mysticism or humanistic
[time=2179] traditionalism or autonomous rationalism but there's only one kind of authority when
[time=2185] we submit to it that brings internal, perpetual satisfaction and fulfillment.
[time=2191] And that's when we submit to the authority of the Word of God and the will of God and it's through obedience at this point that we prove our love for the Lord.
[time=2204] When there's love apart from obedience, that kind of love is mere chatter.
[time=2210] It's empty talk, that's why Jesus said in John chapter 14 and verse 15 he said, "If
[time=2216] you love me, keep my commandments." The evidence of your love is obedience.
[time=2222] You're all familiar with that well-known model of delta airlines.
[time=2227] You see it almost every week on your TV screen.
[time=2230] They say, "We love flying and it shows.
[time=2235] We love flying and it shows in the quality of the service that we provide.
[time=2239] We love the Lord.
[time=2240] It's going to reveal itself, manifest itself into quality and the durability of our obedience
[time=2248] to the Lord.
[time=2249] Our obedience to His Word." Now Joshua still is not finished in terms of this responsibility.
[time=2254] I want you to notice the structure of his discussion at this point.
[time=2258] He begins by telling these elders that they are to be diligent in loving the Lord their God and if they love the Lord their God they're going to be obedient.
[time=2266] Because now he shows them three areas, three practical areas where they are to test themselves
[time=2272] in terms of their obedience.
[time=2275] I want you to notice to begin with in verse 7 that Joshua says that if they are obedient to the Lord their God that on the part of these elders, on the part of the nation that there's going to be no identification with pagan culture.
[time=2291] Because Joshua knows that as soon as you've got identification, identification leads to accommodation and when you've got accommodation, accommodation leads to assimilation.
[time=2302] Not too long ago Charles Colson was asked the question concerning the evangelical church in the day and age in which we live as to whether or not culture has more to fear from
[time=2313] the church or does the church have more to fear from culture?
[time=2318] Have you know anything about church history?
[time=2320] You know that when the church has been the church and when it has been committed to its mission and its message, the message of redemption, the powerful message of redemption through Christ that culture has feared the impact of the church.
[time=2334] We think for instance in the Acts of the Apostles, the early history of the church, remember when the Apostles went forth proclaiming the message of redemption that they turned the world upside down.
[time=2347] But Charles Colson said that tragic situation in America today in the church is that it's
[time=2355] not culture that has to fear the church unfortunately, it's the church that has to fear culture,
[time=2361] the relativism, the secularism, the materialism of the world, a worldly culture has infiltrated
[time=2369] the church and is robbing the church of its life, of its vitality, of its strength and
[time=2376] of its vision.
[time=2378] Not too long ago a book came off the press authored by Russell Chandler entitled "Racing
[time=2385] Toward the Year 2001" and that's what we're doing, we're racing towards that year are
[time=2391] we not?
[time=2392] It's only about seven, eight years away and in this book Chandler points out that in
[time=2398] this last decade of the 20th century that evangelical conservative Christians are going
[time=2404] to increase in number, they're going to increase in quantity but he says unfortunately they're
[time=2411] not going to increase in commitment, that the tragic situation is that the faith of so many evangelicals in the 1990s is that they're going to use their privatized faith
[time=2422] to sanction their own personal pursuit of prosperity, of position and of prestige in this world.
[time=2433] And today in the church we need to hear this message of Joshua when he says if we love the Lord our God, if we are obedient to the Lord our God there's going to be no identification
[time=2445] with pagan culture.
[time=2446] Secondly in verse 7 I want you to know what he also says, that there's to be no idolatry
[time=2452] with the pagan gods.
[time=2454] Notice he says here in verse 7 to these elders I don't want you even to name them, I don't
[time=2460] want you to swear by them, I don't want you to serve them, I don't want you to bow down to them.
[time=2465] Now we all know something about these ancient gods and deities and idols of the Canaanites
[time=2471] about Baal and the Bales and of Asterath and the Asterath and it's one thing for us to
[time=2479] know something about ancient religion and all of these idols and deities but it's another thing for us today in America to be prepared to identify the gods and the idols and the
[time=2492] deities in contemporary American culture and you know this as well as I, that America
[time=2499] is progressively becoming a de-Christianized nation, progressively becoming a pagan nation.
[time=2507] I think of what some of those idols are, some of those gods, we have the cult of self-love today, that has enamored so many, we have the revival of the ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite,
[time=2521] the goddess of erotic love who has cast her spell upon the minds and hearts of so many,
[time=2529] the philosophy of sexism that has permeated American society, today we have the God of
[time=2535] the success syndrome, today we have the God of sensationalistic entertainment, millions
[time=2542] and millions and millions of dollars, every year being poured into entertainment that leaves men and women and young people hollow and empty and yet so many people bow down
[time=2553] to that idol, we have the goddess scientism, not science, there's nothing wrong with science
[time=2560] but scientism, the philosophy that says that the only valid epistemological method of acquiring
[time=2567] authentic knowledge is through the empirical application of the scientific method and that means so, that rules out receiving knowledge from God by way of revelation and there are so many today who are bowing down to the God of the philosophy of scientism, Joshua says
[time=2584] here to these elders, there's to be no identification with pagan culture, there is to be no idolatry
[time=2594] with the pagan gods and then thirdly I want you to notice in verse 12 he says and there's
[time=2600] to be no intermarriage with pagan believers, now this is not a matter of racism, this is
[time=2608] a matter of faith. If the faith is to be transmitted from one generation to another generation,
[time=2616] Joshua saying that those who are of the faith are to marry those who are of the faith but those who are committed to Yahweh the Lord your God are not to be involved in marrying those who are committed to Baal and there's nothing that destroys the transmission of the faith from one generation to another generation when God's people violate this basic principle
[time=2639] and they find themselves involved in intermarrying with those who are not of the faith, there's
[time=2645] to be no identification, there's to be no idolatry and there is to be no intermarriage, those
[time=2654] are the three test cases where we prove our love and where we prove our obedience to the
[time=2662] Lord our God. And then thirdly in this speech in verse 14 after sharing the review and after
[time=2669] sharing the responsibility I want you to notice that Joshua comes to what I call the recognition
[time=2675] and here he wants these elders to recognize that not one word of all of the good words
[time=2683] that the Lord has shared with them has failed to come to pass. This is perhaps the classic
[time=2691] text dealing with the faithfulness of God in the Old Testament, not one word of all of
[time=2698] the good words that God has given to you as a nation has failed to come to pass. Notice
[time=2705] here in verses 14 to 16 that the word good occurs four times and verses 14 and 15 we
[time=2712] have the good word, the good word twice. Then in verses 15 and 16 we have the good land, the good land twice. God promised in his good word the good land to his people. The promised
[time=2725] land, the land of their inheritance and obviously when Joshua is sharing this truth, this principle
[time=2731] with these elders he's taking them back to their historic roots in the book of Genesis.
[time=2736] When God promised to Abraham that he would give to Abraham and his descendants their own land, the promised land, the land of their inheritance which is the land of Canaan and God gave that promise to Abraham then he repeated it and gave it to Isaac, he gave it then to Jacob and then later he gave it to Moses. Year after year, generation after
[time=2758] generation God kept promising his people that there's a land out there, it's your land, it's my gift to you, it's your inheritance. One day you will be in it, one day you will occupy it, one day you will enjoy it. One of the great texts in the book of Joshua was
[time=2776] found in chapter 5 verse 9. After Joshua has led the children of Israel across the Jordan
[time=2784] in chapter 3 and in chapter 4 and chapter 5 verse 9, the Lord says to Joshua, Joshua, "Today I have removed the reproach of the Egyptians from you." Now what did the Lord
[time=2796] mean by that? Well when Israel was in captivity in Egypt and when the Israelites were sharing
[time=2805] their faith and talking about the promised land that one day they would inhabit and
[time=2813] that would be given to them. The Egyptians were mocking them, ridiculing them, scoffing
[time=2821] at them, taunting them and they were saying that's nothing but pie in the sky theology.
[time=2828] You're dreaming man, you're dreaming man, there's nothing out there for you but now in Joshua chapter 5 verse 9, the Lord says to Joshua, "Today I have removed the reproach
[time=2840] of the Egyptian from you and it was on that day as you know that the manna for the first time in 40 years ceased and Israel began to enjoy the produce of the land." God is faithful,
[time=2855] God was faithful to Joshua, He was faithful to these elders, He was faithful to the nation
[time=2863] of Israel, He's faithful to you, He's faithful to me, He's faithful to His word, He's faithful to His promises. This as I say is the classic text dealing with the faithfulness of God
[time=2875] in the Old Testament. Let me if I may take you to the New Testament and briefly share with you the eight major texts dealing with the faithfulness of God. In first Corinthians
[time=2887] chapter 1 verse 9, Paul says to the Corinthians, "God is faithful by whom you are called into
[time=2896] fellowship with His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful to maintain you in that fellowship
[time=2904] with Christ, blameless unto the end." And then in first Corinthians chapter 10 verse
[time=2910] 13, Paul says to the same grip of people of the Corinthians, he says, "There has no temptation
[time=2916] taken you but such is as common to man, but God is faithful and He will not allow any temptation
[time=2923] to overtake you that you cannot bear but will with the temptation provide a way of escape
[time=2929] that you may be able to bear it. God is faithful in our times of testings and in our times of
[time=2936] trials to provide a way of escape." The third text is found in first Thessalonians chapter
[time=2943] 5 verse 24 where Paul says, "Faithful is He who is called you who also will do it."
[time=2950] Now if you look at that text in its context, you will find that Paul there is dealing with the sanctification of God's people. God has a personal investment in the sanctification
[time=2960] in the holiness of his people, those whom he has called God is faithful in sanctifying
[time=2967] them that they will come to that place of total commitment and total consecration to the Lord in their lives. The fourth text is second Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 3 where
[time=2978] Paul says, "That the Lord is faithful and He will protect you and strengthen you against
[time=2985] the evil one. He is faithful in giving you that protection and giving you that strength when you trust Him day after day. The Lord doesn't want you to succumb to satanic temptations
[time=2998] and satanic indulgences." And then the next text, the fifth text is 2 Timothy chapter
[time=3007] 2 verse 13 where Paul says, "If we are faithless," and indeed that's true of all of us, is it
[time=3014] not? That there are many times when unfortunately you're faithless and I'm faithless. But Paul says, "If we are faithless yet He abides faithful." That is God is faithful. He cannot
[time=3027] deny Himself. That's bringing us back to the fact that God's nature is a nature of integrity.
[time=3033] He cannot deny Himself and He cannot deny His word or His promises. The next text is Hebrews
[time=3040] chapter 10 verse 23 where the author of Hebrews says, "Let us hold fast the confession of
[time=3049] our hope without wavering, for He is faithful who is promised." The Hebrews that the author
[time=3057] is writing to are going through a difficult time, a perplexing time and they need encouragement
[time=3063] and the encouragement that is given to them is that God is faithful in His time before fail His promises to you. So therefore hold on to your faith and to your hope without
[time=3074] wavering. The seventh text is 1 Peter chapter 4 verse 19 where Peter challenges his readers
[time=3082] who are going through a fiery ordeal and he says, "Let those who are suffering according
[time=3089] to the will of God entrust the keeping of their souls into the hands of a faithful creator."
[time=3095] God is a faithful creator. He's all-powerful and if God by His power was able to bring
[time=3101] this universe into existence and creating the heavens and the earth surely God has the power to sustain you and to sustain me when we're going through the fiery ordeals of life. And finally the eighth text is 1 John chapter 1 and verse 9 where John says, "If
[time=3117] we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God is faithful in maintaining our fellowship with Christ. He's faithful to us in our times of temptation and in our times of trial. God is faithful to us in sanctifying us in making His holy and distinctive people. God is faithful in
[time=3140] protecting us when we trust in Him. Some time ago I read of a speedboat driver who had a
[time=3152] near fatal accident going at a tremendously high speed and his boat flipped over and he was thrown out of his boat and he hit the water with such an impact that he was submerged
[time=3164] beneath the surface into the deep dark waters and he was disoriented and dizzy in topsy
[time=3171] terry not knowing what was up and what was down. He hit that water with such an impact that he had his life jacket torn from him. But even in his state of semi-consciousness
[time=3184] he had enough rationality to know to hang on to that life jacket which he did and he found that he did so. That life jacket gradually brought him to the surface where he was able
[time=3196] to get that breath of fresh air and to be revitalized again. You know there are times
[time=3202] in your life and times in my life when we are submerged beneath the surface submerged
[time=3208] into the deep dark waters disoriented dizzy. We don't know what's up. We don't know what's down and I need a life jacket and you need a life jacket. Something to hold on to. Something
[time=3218] in our desperation that's going to bring us to the surface of my friend the life jacket you need. A life jacket that I need is the faithfulness of God. God is faithful. Faithful
[time=3228] to his word. Faithful to his promises and he's faithful to his people. And then finally
[time=3235] I want you to notice in this farewell address of Joshua that after the review and the responsibility
[time=3244] and the recognition we come now to the reminder in verse 15. And here Joshua is reminding
[time=3252] these elders of Israel, these officers of Israel who are gathered before him. He reminds them
[time=3259] that God is not only faithful in his grace. Faithful in fulfilling his promises when his promises are satisfied by means of their conditions. But God is also faithful in carrying out his
[time=3271] threats. The God's threats are not spoken in vain just as his promises are not spoken in vain and that God's threats are as real as God's promises are reliable and that God's
[time=3285] threats are as fearful as his commandments are rewarding. And here Joshua is seeking
[time=3294] to teach these elders that disobedience to the revealed word of God carries with it a
[time=3300] high price. And I want you to notice in verse 13 the graphic language that he uses. He says to these elders if they're going to initiate a policy of disobedience rather than passing
[time=3313] on the torch, transmitting the faith, if they're going to initiate disobedience and accommodate
[time=3319] themselves to pagan culture that they as a nation are going to experience. See it for yourself now. The snares and the traps and the whips and the thorns. You know there are
[time=3332] some decisions that we make that we're not careful in terms of our choices. The results
[time=3339] many times can be drastic. They can be dire consequences. In 1938 the then prime minister
[time=3349] of Great Britain was Neville and Chamberlain. As you may recall he went to Munich that year
[time=3355] and he sought to appease Adolf Hitler and he came back to London, England and he said peace in our times, peace in our times. But you may recall that there was another leader
[time=3367] in Great Britain by the name of Winston Churchill and he knew that that peace was nothing but a shallow faking peace. And he got up in the English Parliament and addressing his fellow
[time=3378] parliamentarians he said you had the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor
[time=3386] and now you're going to have war and his words were prophetically true within a few months
[time=3392] England was involved in war with Hitlerism.
[time=3406] Once again it was our privilege to bring you music from our sanctuary choir with Scott Schindler directing and a special solo on the trumpet by Gary Kance. The message today
