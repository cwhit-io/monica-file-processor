[time=0] Do you realize that most Americans don't like their jobs?
[time=4] In fact, a recent survey indicated that over 50 percent said they would rather have chosen
[time=10] a completely different line of work than the one they're in, and it would change if they could, but they feel trapped because of the salary they're making and their reputation.
[time=22] Oftentimes, people think the solution to that is to change jobs or even change careers.
[time=26] But the Word of God may indicate differently.
[time=28] We'll find today about the Christian work ethic and how Christians can be used by God to bring glory to Him in the place that they work.
[time=49] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study and music and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=55] Thank you for joining us.
[time=58] A recent Gallup poll indicates that most Americans are dissatisfied with their jobs.
[time=62] A well-known career management consultant firm confirms that more than one-half of all Americans would choose a different line of work if they could start again.
[time=71] However, most can't afford to change and hence, they feel trapped in their jobs.
[time=76] Christians are not immune to those feelings.
[time=79] Stay tuned as Pastor Moore explores the biblical work ethic and how it can bring meaning and purpose to your job in a message he has entitled "Christians in the Workplace."
[time=90] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of First Timothy, who will be looking at chapter 6, verses 1 and 2.
[time=100] Our special music today will be provided by Keith and Starr Braddockum.
[time=105] As we begin our service today, let's join with the congregation as they participate in a responsive reading entitled, "Justification Through Faith."
[time=116] Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, and not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations, knowing that
[time=139] tribulation brings about perseverance, and hope does not disappoint because the love
[time=151] of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=164] For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would even dare to die.
[time=173] The God demonstrates the love for us in that all we rest is Christ's right for us.
[time=180] Much more than, having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him.
[time=188] [inaudible]
[time=201] And not only this, but we also exalt in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
[time=210] [inaudible]
[time=225] We thank God for the reading of the Word you may be seated, and we'll continue as we sing the song, "Heaven Came Down," and "Glory Filled My Soul," 495.
[time=235] This is the testimony of the believer that an accepted Christ is their savior, 495 will
[time=265] be the King of the Holy Spirit.
[time=272] [inaudible]
[time=382] Thank you again for your good singing.
[time=384] We continue with music now as we listen to Keith and star Bronigam, let's open our hearts to the message they have for us.
[time=408] [inaudible]
[time=593] Well, thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today, or also we were just talking before
[time=604] we went on the insert about the number of people in our church that really have needed the prayers of our body of believers for various reasons, in most cases, of some serious illnesses.
[time=614] Well, we've had some operations, we've had some people diagnosed with cancer, and beyond
[time=620] that even in our own church family, a lot of people from the Bible Hour have been writing and sharing their concerns, and we thought we'd just take a minute with you this morning and pray that God would give you grace as you're struggling.
[time=630] So would you pray with me for just a minute?
[time=631] Father, we want to lift up the people both in our church and in the Christian community
[time=637] as we are together in this ministry.
[time=640] People who have gone through serious operations are sick in some significant way, even those
[time=646] who have been diagnosed with cancer are struggling.
[time=649] And Father, we ask you to give these people and their families real grace and strength as they fight their way through a very difficult trial, give them a special sense of your presence
[time=660] and encouragement, and help those around them to encourage them through loving and tangible ways.
[time=665] We pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=669] Thank you Russ, and we want to encourage those of you that are watching us by way of television, that every Wednesday morning we look over those letters that come in, especially those that have prayer requests, and a march, and Ed, and I sit and pray for those requests
[time=683] asking God to intervene in your lives.
[time=685] So we encourage you to write to us and tell us of your needs so that we can pray intelligently for you.
[time=690] Let me tell you again about some events that are taking place.
[time=693] We continue to go with our celebration on Wednesday evenings, our summer celebration.
[time=699] We will be having John Davis with us.
[time=702] I hope that you'll join with us on August 12.
[time=705] We'll be here at 7 p.m. on Wednesday evening at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=709] Join us for an evening of inspiration in the middle of the week.
[time=712] And then if you like brass, I know of no finer group than the King's Brass that will be with
[time=718] us here at Black Hawk Baptist Church on August 16.
[time=723] That's a Sunday evening.
[time=724] They'll be here at 6 p.m.
[time=725] I hope that you'll join with us and be here that night to hear their inspiring music.
[time=732] And then we look ahead to August 30 on a Sunday morning.
[time=736] We'll have Dan and Donna Oxley.
[time=739] Dan is an outstanding trumpet player and Donna, his wife, is a fine soloist.
[time=744] They'll be here with inspiring music.
[time=747] Dan and Donna traveled with the young Messiah tour last year and just again another outstanding
[time=753] team of musicians.
[time=755] We want to encourage you to join with us.
[time=757] And there are other events coming up.
[time=759] Then of course September 13th, we've got Bring a Friend Sunday, which will be a very special Sunday for us.
[time=764] It's kind of a back and a saddle Sunday bringing everybody back from all the summer activities and bringing friends with them.
[time=770] And of course we give a special invitation to any of those of you who would like to come and visit us on that day.
[time=776] We'll be having Steve and Maria Gardner with us.
[time=779] They are former members of our church, live in Colorado now, but always great to have them back along with Mandy.
[time=785] And we'll be telling you more about that exciting Sunday on September 13th.
[time=790] Hope you can come and join with us.
[time=792] Now just before we go back to some good music at the message from our pastor, I want to remind you about the book that we're offering.
[time=797] It's entitled How to Grow a Happy Family, a great booklet that is a guide to just giving
[time=803] you some suggestions on how you can lead your children and the things of the Lord.
[time=807] And I hope that you'll take time to write for this book How to Grow a Happy Family.
[time=812] You could receive it by writing to the Bible, a whore, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=818] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=821] You could write for it and just ask for it.
[time=823] If you could send a donation, we'd appreciate that very much.
[time=826] Again, the book is How to Grow a Happy Family, an exciting book for young married couples
[time=833] who are beginning to rear their children.
[time=835] We're going to go back to the live portion of our services.
[time=838] As I mentioned, we're delighted to have Keith and Starr Brodygum with us this week and they're
[time=844] going to minister to us in song now and then we'll have our message from Russell Moore.
[time=849] I hope you'll stay tuned for the entire broadcast.
[time=863] Why should I feel desperate, why should the shadows come, why should my heart be lonely,
[time=892] and long for heaven and hope, when Jesus is my portion, my constant friend is here,
[time=914] I know he watches me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me,
[time=1147] I sing because I'm happy, I sing because I'm free for his eyes on the spell.
[time=1169] And I know he watches me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me,
[time=3024] me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me, he watches me, I
[time=3024] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 101 seconds] me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me, I know he watches me, he watches me, I...
[time=3150] unbelieving employees because they find the unbelieving employee to be better motivated, more
[time=3157] faithful, more consistent, and more supportive than his believing employees. All of us have run
[time=3163] into unbelievers who want nothing to do with Christianity or the Christian faith because they used to have a Christian employee. That's all they need to know about Christianity.
[time=3174] What it tells the unbelieving boss is that money is a better motivator than God. Money is a
[time=3180] better motivator than truth. These people who hold and cling for their very life and their eternity
[time=3186] to the person of Christ can't find sufficient motivation to be faithful, integrable, hard-working
[time=3192] employees. In fact, the people I really want to hire are the people who simply just want money from me.
[time=3200] Sad state of affairs, but it happens. Okay, now back to 1 Timothy, chapter 6, and let's look at the
[time=3208] believing boss. That's how believers treat the unbelieving boss. How do believers treat the
[time=3214] believing boss, the Christian employer? And that would mean whether you're at GTE and you happen to
[time=3220] have a supervisor that's a believer or whether you work at this church or whether you work for
[time=3226] you for Christ or wherever you work, you have a believing boss. Verse 2, "And let those who have
[time=3232] believers as their masters not be disrespectful to them because they are the brethren, because they
[time=3238] are believers, but let them serve them all the more." When you enter into an arena in which both the
[time=3244] employer and the employee are working in the same setting, you have a whole new dynamic,
[time=3251] a whole new set of game rules, and it's not always healthy. The word disrespect in verse 2,
[time=3260] don't be disrespectful. It's a Greek word that draws the image of pulling a person down, pulling a person down from their place of authority. And what Paul is guarding against is that because
[time=3271] you happen to have a believing boss, don't pull him down off of his position of authority just because you share a light precious faith, just because you're both heirs of salvation, just because in the eyes of Jesus he died for both of you the same way, and there is equality in the spiritual dimension of our Christian faith. Don't pull them down, don't degrade them, don't rob them of their distinction as your superior, as your authority, and as your boss. This happens all the time in
[time=3297] subtle ways. Christians will come in late from a lunch break and expect to be excused for that by
[time=3304] their Christian boss because they were having their devotions, or they will expect to come in late
[time=3311] because they were having a Bible study with some other people, and somebody there had just a real vital question about the truth, and they just couldn't tear themselves away, and that's all supposed to be excused now that I'm 35 minutes late for work. Now of course sometimes a Christian employer is delighted under those circumstances, and he's given you that permission, but the point is don't grasp at that, don't assume that, don't demand that, instead work him all the more,
[time=3335] serve your believing master all the more, work harder for him than you would for anybody else.
[time=3340] Sometimes a believer will say to their employer, their believing employer, man, I'm sorry I didn't
[time=3346] get that extra commission or didn't do that extra work, I just didn't feel led of the Lord, as if this is God's fault now, that we're not making the kind of money we should, or we didn't land the kind of deal. That is just foreign thought, that's just not here, double your efforts,
[time=3361] serve him all the more, work all the harder, don't devalue his position of authority.
[time=3366] Why? What's the motive? Look at it in the verse two, because those who partake of the benefit
[time=3375] are believers and beloved. When you multiply your efforts and you work even harder for a believing
[time=3382] employer, you have the joy of knowing that your extra work benefits his status and his position.
[time=3389] You'll make your believing employer look better in that company, because he'll be better, because his
[time=3395] department will do better, because you're doubling.
[time=3397] We've been sharing with you the ministry of music from Keith and Starr Brodygum and the message
[time=3411] was from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore. We thank you for joining us, and just before we close,
[time=3417] I'd like to take this moment and pray a prayer with you, particularly if you've trusted Christ as your Savior today. Let's bow and pray this prayer together. Dear Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful
[time=3428] that I can come to you today, and I know that as I ask you to come into my heart and to be my
[time=3434] Savior that I am set free from the bondage of sin, I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen. If you prayed that prayer today,
[time=3447] would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3457] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the book entitled How to Grow a Happy Family,
[time=3463] please write to the vital hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3470] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1563 or mention the
[time=3479] message by pastor Moore entitled Christians in the Workplace, and please enclose a gift of $3
[time=3485] to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
