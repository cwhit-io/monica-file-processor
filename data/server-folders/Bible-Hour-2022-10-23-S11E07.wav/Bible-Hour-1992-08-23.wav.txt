[time=0] As Paul writes to Timothy, "Timothy is on a solo flight."
[time=6] This is Timothy's first opportunity to be out on his own.
[time=10] He has successfully brought the aircraft into the air.
[time=13] He's gotten it off the runway.
[time=16] The question is whether or not Timothy will complete successfully the flight which he has begun, the mission which he has been sent on at Ephesus.
[time=25] And Paul, in writing this epistle to Timothy, uses a term, not Pilate, and he in no one
[time=31] since cuts his tie or his cloak off, but he in very much the same way is trying to impress
[time=37] upon the mind and heart of Timothy my son, you have moved into a new category.
[time=44] And the category is not that of a Pilate, it is that of a man of God.
[time=55] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible-studied music and fellowship, which we hope you will
[time=65] find to be in encouragement.
[time=67] Thank you for joining us.
[time=68] The title "Man of God" was reserved in the Old Testament for select spiritual leaders, men like Moses, Elijah, Samuel, and David.
[time=77] In today's text, Paul provides some much-needed encouragement to Timothy by calling him a man of God.
[time=82] He then goes on to explain the responsibilities that come with that designation.
[time=87] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of first Timothy, who will be looking at chapter 6 verses 11 through 16.
[time=96] Our special music today will be provided by Margie Isaacson.
[time=102] And by Scott Schindler, let's now join the service which is already in progress.
[time=113] There is a prayer for me and my Jesus.
[time=120] There is a wonderful place to find us here.
[time=127] No one else will take the sin and pardon me from me.
[time=134] No one must be fed for free.
[time=151] No one will be loved for free.
[time=157] He gave his time for what he did.
[time=165] No one will be loved for free.
[time=180] True, true, true God will grow.
[time=186] There is one more man by the show.
[time=192] No one will be fed for the love of his share.
[time=200] Oh, how he loves you.
[time=232] No one will be fed for free.
[time=425] Well, if you've been listening since the beginning of the program,
[time=436] you've heard some wonderful music and, in particular, the choir singing.
[time=440] There's going to be a revival in the land.
[time=442] I really appreciate my assistant, Scott Schindler Russell.
[time=445] I don't know what we do without Scott at the organ and this today.
[time=448] He led the choir and he just does a myriad of things that are just wonderful, and I appreciate it.
[time=453] Scott is a marvelously gifted individual, especially when he sits down in front of those pearly keys and does his magic.
[time=460] But then I guess we're going to hear some more from him today.
[time=462] Yes, not only will he lead the choir, but he'll be playing a piano solo just before the message, and I've heard the practice, and our people are going to be blessed.
[time=471] We're looking forward to the fall of the year, and again, Russell, we're anxious for our messages that you've been announcing, and the theme sounds very interesting coming up in the fall.
[time=480] Well, thank you, Peter.
[time=481] I want to talk a little bit about spiritual warfare, and I think there are a lot of people with very significant questions about Satan, his origin, and his impact on current affairs, not just on a national level, but also in our own lives.
[time=497] In fact, just Sunday night after the service, someone asked me, "Can Satan hear my prayers?" And if he can hear my prayers, can he fabricate answers to give me the impression that in fact God answered?
[time=510] And there are all kinds of questions about his scope, what he can actually do, and so we want to talk about that.
[time=517] And then also the whole issue of demons, and the difference between demon oppression and demon possession, and can a believer be demon possessed?
[time=526] And just to what degree can the demons influence an individual Christian life and impede their spiritual growth?
[time=532] And that, by way of framework, and then of course the question is, how do I fight the spiritual battle?
[time=538] And of course, Paredi's books have raised a lot of interest in that and raised some interesting insights.
[time=544] So I'm looking forward to fresh discovery in God's word about Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare.
[time=550] Well, I'm excited about the topic and looking forward to it.
[time=553] We can all learn something for our own particular lives.
[time=556] And if you're not a regular attender at church, and you watch the Bible regularly, Bible our regularly, we're glad for that, but if you're able to get to church, let me invite you to come to our church on Sunday, September 13th.
[time=569] We're going to have one service.
[time=571] We're calling it Friend Day.
[time=572] I have a little reception time from 9 o'clock till 945 with coffee and donuts, and then just one service at 10 o'clock.
[time=579] We'll have Steve, and Maria, and Mandy Gardner, coming former residents of Fort Wayne.
[time=584] If you listen to our local Christian radio stations, you'll know that they're popular on the radio and just have a wonderful ministry of music.
[time=592] They'll be coming from Colorado Springs to our church on September 13th for Friend Day, 10 a.m.
[time=598] So mark that date.
[time=599] If you're not a regular attender at church, we really want you to come and visit that day and hope that you'll find a church home right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=608] So join with us and anticipate these messages from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=614] They'll really give you good insight into what's happening in this day and age.
[time=619] Then I want to tell you about another date.
[time=621] On September 18th, we're going to be having Ray Bolts.
[time=624] Ray Bolts will be in concert on Friday evening at 8 p.m.
[time=627] September 18th.
[time=629] I'm looking forward to that date.
[time=630] Tickets are on sale at all of the major bookstores and will be available here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=637] So if you have the opportunity to come, I hope you will.
[time=640] Tickets are $5.
[time=641] They're going fast.
[time=642] That date again is September 18th and that's a Friday evening at 8 p.m.
[time=649] Russell, we pride ourselves, I think, in the fact that when we started even the Bible, in fact when we changed the name a number of years ago, we talked about our focal point would be the Bible, the Word of God, the truth.
[time=663] And we're talking about a booklet this month.
[time=666] It's called "Is Christianity True?" And I want to take a moment and just share with you the six points.
[time=672] I wrote them down this week because I think they're important and there'd be topics for you to discuss with your neighbor over coffee or a friend at work when you have a break time.
[time=681] Let me share with you these six points in the book.
[time=684] First of all, the existence of God, the inspiration of the Bible, the deity and humanity of Jesus Christ, the redemption purchased on Calvary, salvation by faith alone, and finally, life everlasting and eternal hope.
[time=700] I hope that you'll write for this booklet today.
[time=702] You can receive "Is Christianity True?" by writing to the Bible hour, and the address is 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=715] Once again, just write to the Bible hour and ask for the booklet "Is Christianity True?" Give you that address again at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=729] We're certainly glad that you stay tuned for the Bible hour and that you will remain with us as we listen to some more music from Scott Schindler and then the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.

[time=1141] How does he live with himself? You know? I don't understand it. Goodness gracious. We are so thankful for him and for Peter and for all the people that minister to us on a weekly basis and can hardly wait for the choir to get going back again. Man, we are so blessed in this church just to have that kind of privilege to be a minister to a music so regularly.
[time=1163] Well, as we set our minds to the Word of God, let me talk to you just a minute about my dad's first solo flight in his airplane. He had taken a new job in Central California. It was a 10 county territory. He was a salesman.
[time=1180] And as he began to run his route and get involved in his territory, he found out that if he was going to be faithful to his job, he would never be home because it was just too much traveling, too many nights gone.
[time=1191] And he was committed not to letting that happen to our family. And so with time after he kind of got the territory established, he went on a limb and he bought a plane, a little Cessna 182, a four-seater plane that he would be able to get anywhere in the territory with about an hour and a half. He could work today and then come back and be home for dinner with the family.
[time=1209] But he had this small matter of becoming a pilot. And I remember there were many anxious moments in this process of becoming a pilot. And if you're a pilot in the room today, you will identify, I think, with some of the years.
[time=1220] But I know that my dad was really nervous about the written examination and all that he had to know about the weather and all that he had to know about the radio and all that he had to know about maps and all the stuff that they required a pilot to know before they let him up there.
[time=1235] But his most anxious moment was his first solo flight because as most men I talk to and women who are pilots will tell you that the real difficulty is not getting the machine in the air.
[time=1248] It's safely returning back to Earth. And when you're doing that for the very first time, and for all the repetition you've done it, there's always been your teacher, there's always been your teacher, there's always been your teacher, who you know could pull you out in the moment of crisis.
[time=1262] When you roll down the runway for the first time and you're suddenly airborne and it dawns on you, it's now me and me alone.
[time=1269] And my dad went out and made his turn and came back around and made it successful though, well we called it a controlled crash, but he made it and everything was fine.
[time=1280] The instructor then came up to him as my dad was getting out of the plane with a pair of scissors, oddly enough and cut my dad's tie off and then cut a big hole out of his shirt.
[time=1292] And it was an odd thing to do, but it was a move of great genius.
[time=1297] The instructor had flown and military missions, had trained hundreds of pilots, and he knew that what he wanted to do was to cement into the mind of his pupil, that he had now moved into a different category, a different classification.
[time=1312] He was now a pilot, so that in future excursions when that still tentative and still very new and fresh and novice pilot would find himself full of jitters and anxiety and in the winds that can come and the real question mark in his mind whether or not he could pilot the ship safely back to planet Earth, he would have a memory in his mind, a shocking somewhat out of the ordinary memory of his instructor cutting off his tie and cutting off the front part of his shirt.
[time=1341] You are now a pilot.
[time=1345] And that really sets the scene for us this morning. Timothy is on his first voyage.
[time=1351] Timothy is going now to this new ministry and he will pilot by himself.
[time=1356] As you turn to 1 Timothy, chapter 6, you'll remember that here to 4 Timothy has been with his tutor.
[time=1363] He has no doubt taken the controls at points, he's preached a few message, he's confronted a few people, he's probably been involved in various levels of ministry but always there was the master pilot sitting next to him who could bail him out if he were to get into trouble, but not this time.
[time=1380] This time Timothy flies alone, this time he is on his solo flight at the city of Ephesus standing for the cause of Christ.
[time=1389] And though Paul in this passage does not cut off his cloak or take a tassel off or even cut off part of his hair, he definitely identifies in Timothy's mind that you have moved into a new category, a new classification by three little words that you'll find at the beginning of verse 11.
[time=1408] First Timothy, chapter 6, but flee from these things, here they are, you man of God.
[time=1419] For Timothy to be called a man of God, it was as if he had just passed some incredible examination.
[time=1427] Because this phrase, man of God is not one that originated with Paul, it comes from the Old Testament, and it was sparingly used in the Old Testament, of mighty men of valor.
[time=1437] Moses was called a man of God, Elijah was called a man of God, Elisha, Solomon, David and a few of the prophets.
[time=1450] And for Paul at this point in time in the history of Timothy's development to say you or a man of God would be to rank him with some of the greats in Biblical history.
[time=1461] Men who had been selected by God, you were not a man of God because you wanted to be a man of God, you were a man of God because God made you a man of God.
[time=1471] It is a possessive term, God's man, man of God or better said, God's man, chosen by God.
[time=1479] Secondly, prepared by God, and as you look to the Old Testament you'll find that God would orchestrate the events of these men's lives in very unique and powerful ways to build the character, to build the vision, to build the faith, to build the commitment, to build a sense of whole-hearted commitment to the cause of the kingdom.
[time=1498] Beyond that, they were then given God's word as their most prized possession.
[time=1504] And the man of God either wrote the word of God or received the word of God, and he held it in prize that above all else.
[time=1510] Whether by prophetic utterance, as the case with Elijah, or rather writing the entire first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch, as the case was with Moses.
[time=1519] But they were men of the word, men who had received God's word.
[time=1523] And they were also men who stood for the truth.
[time=1526] They were also men who, against the opposition of their day, would unequivocally and unwavering stand for that word which they had received from their God.
[time=1535] So these were men not men of the world, not men of great influence or means, not ladies men, not macho men, not even their own men.
[time=1545] These were God's men.
[time=1547] God's men. And what Paul says to Timothy almost by way of graduating him and to ensure in his own heart that he was capable to fly the mission as a solo pilot, you are God's man.
[time=1562] God has chosen you, God has prepared you, God has given you his word, now stand for the truth.
[time=1567] And you remember Timothy was having difficulty doing that.
[time=1570] Timothy found his way into the city of Ephesus and a culture dominated by the temple Diana or the temple Artemis which was given to wanton sexuality and sensuality and lustful passion and pleasure.
[time=1582] And it was a dominating structure physically as it was in its culture.
[time=1586] In addition to that he found that within the various little churches scattered out throughout the city of Ephesus there were men who had found their way in the leadership who were not believers.
[time=1595] They were false prophets, they were sheeps, they were wolves in sheep's clothing and they were propagating a damning dangerous demon doctrine.
[time=1603] And in the front and the face of all of that opposition, Timothy wanted to quit.
[time=1608] And as you remember from previous study of this book, in chapter 1 verse 18 he says to Timothy, "I entrust to you Timothy my son in accordance with the prophecies previously made concerning you that by them you may fight the good fight."
[time=1621] The prophecies meaning those New Testament prophets that had been sent by God to single out Timothy as a man of God.
[time=1629] And when Timothy was questioning his calling, when Timothy was saying maybe I shouldn't be in the ministry, maybe I wound up in this by accident or this really was never in God's will for my life.
[time=1638] Paul calls him back to an understanding of his being placed in the ministry by the very prophets of God.
[time=1643] In chapter 4 verse 14 Timothy questions his capacity for ministry, his charisma in the Greek, his spiritual giftedness, and maybe the issue of his being in the ministry was resolved, but whether or not he had enough to successfully do the work of the ministry raised itself as a question in his mind.
[time=1660] And so Paul wrote, "Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you.
[time=1664] Do not neglect the spiritual gift or the package of gifts which is given to every believer at the point of their salvation.
[time=1670] And you indeed, Timothy, had that conferred upon you by prophetic utterance and the laying on of hands of the presbytery.
[time=1675] Not only these prophets who came and confirmed his charisma or his giftedness for the ministry, but then a whole church and assembly of believers, the elders representing them laying hands on him saying, "You are so gifted.
[time=1687] You are so to be used in the kingdom of God." And now finally in chapter 6, Paul's letter of encouragement and strength and direction comes to his young disciple who flies his first solo flight.
[time=1702] He says, "Don't ever shirk the wonder and the incredible privilege of being a man of God."
[time=1710] And he declares in Timothy's years a title what is given to no other man in the New Testament specifically or explicitly other than Timothy.
[time=1720] You are a man of God.
[time=1724] Don't shrink from the responsibilities, the enormous sense of responsibility, the overwhelming burden that it may represent.
[time=1732] Follow and seek your God.
[time=1734] And now in this text verses 11 through 16, we'll look at the marks of a man of God.
[time=1740] A man of God is marked first of all by what he flees from verse 11, but flee from these things.
[time=1748] Secondly, a man of God is marked by what he fights for.
[time=1751] Verse 12, "Fight the good fight of faith." And lastly, the man of God is marked by what he is faithful to.
[time=1759] Verse 14, "That you keep the commandment without staying." So the man of God marked by what he flees from, by what he fights for, and what he is faithful to.
[time=1768] And before we dive into the exposition of this text, let me remind you that the last time that this phrase "Man of God" is used in the New Testament, Paul broadens its scope.
[time=1779] It's found just a few pages to your right over in 2 Timothy chapter 3.
[time=1783] It says, "There all scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training and righteousness."
[time=1791] Then verse 17, "But that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good word."
[time=1798] So it's last use in the word of God comes to us to say that the word of God is given not just to Timothy, not just to Moses, not just to David, not just to Samuel.
[time=1809] But it's given to all of us that all of us might be men of God, equipped, adequate for every good word.
[time=1817] Men and women of God, people of God, nurtured, trained, reproved, corrected, and taught in the word of God.
[time=1828] So as we begin to look at this text this morning, I want to challenge you in the same way to be a man or a woman of God.
[time=1836] Are you fleeing what the man of God flees? Are you fighting for what the man of God fights for?
[time=1843] And are you truly faithful to the things that the man of God is faithful to?
[time=1848] Well, we begin in chapter 11, or excuse me, verse 11.
[time=1851] It says there, "But flee from these things, you man of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness."
[time=1860] The word "flee" is "fuge" in the Greek. It's the word from which we derive our word "fugitive."
[time=1866] "Flee" like a fugitive. "Flee" for your life. "Flee" with a sense of utter desperation for the well-being of your person.
[time=1874] Matthew 2, "The angel of the Lord appears to Joseph and says, 'Take your wife and the child and flee to Egypt, obviously, for their lives.'"
[time=1883] Matthew 3, 7, John the Baptist sees, describes the Pharisees coming out of the town, and he looks at them and says, "You brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?"
[time=1895] It's a word that describes utter desperation and urgency fleeing at all costs that which would threaten the life and the soul of an individual.
[time=1904] The man of God, the woman of God is a runner, a runner. The person of God runs from evil.
[time=1913] The verb is a present imperative verb which means it is in the constant state of running.
[time=1919] The person of God never stops running from evil, for they know the minute they do, it will overtake them.
[time=1924] There is a sense of urgent desperation in which they continually run from the evil that would overtake them.
[time=1931] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 6 to flee immorality.
[time=1936] In 1 Corinthians 10, 14 to flee idolatry, anything in your life that would surpass God's place as king, lord, and leader.
[time=1946] In 2 Timothy 2 verses 20 to 23, Paul says to Timothy to flee youthful lusts.
[time=1953] And in the passage in front of us, the command is to flee these things. What things?
[time=1959] Remember from last Lord's Day's message, these things are gain, profit, money.
[time=1965] He's saying, "Timothy, flee the mental decision to get rich, flee the love of money, desert it, turn your back and run as fast and as far and as long and as hard as you can from the influences which would lead you to have a life consumed with the pursuit of money."
[time=1982] Why? Verse 9 as you remember because if you do that, you will continually fall into temptation.
[time=1988] You will become like the animal that is caught in the snare, this the snare of money.
[time=1992] You will be full of foolish and harmful lusts which will plunge your very soul into ruin and destruction.
[time=2000] So he says, "Flee these things, old man of God. Strip them from your life."
[time=2006] You say, "How do I do that? How do I flee?" Well, it's a two-sided coin, two-edged sword. Look again at verse 11.
[time=2017] "Flee from these things you men of God and what? And pursue, pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness."
[time=2026] In other words, it's not enough to run away from evil. You've got to be running towards godliness.
[time=2033] It's not enough to try to escape some evil or peril in your life by looking at it and focusing on it and trying to run away from it.
[time=2042] You must reverse not only the pattern and the direction of your feet, but of your mind and of your heart and of your eyes by setting your pursuit on the things which are listed here.
[time=2051] Paul uses the same word for "pursue" in Galatians chapter 1 describing the energetic, zealous manner in which he before Christ pursued the church.
[time=2060] And we know Paul before Christ, and we know the pursuit of the church that he conducted, and it was absolute, unmitigated terror.
[time=2068] It consumed his life. It was the passion of his heart. He didn't do anything except pursue and persecute the church.
[time=2076] That should be the intensity with which these six virtues are sought in the life of the person of God.
[time=2083] Let's briefly look at them. The first is righteousness, pursue righteousness. It means not the forensic imputed righteousness that comes to a sinner at the point of salvation whereby Romans chapter 3, they're declared righteousness.
[time=2096] This is the practical righteousness. This is the godly behavior. Simply said, this is to do right.
[time=2102] Righteousness is practically to do right. Do right towards God. Do right towards man. Do right for God and for man.
[time=2110] It is the outward external behavior of doing right towards God and man.
[time=2116] But lest it be viewed as punctill your events, as simple little dotted infrequent evidence of godliness in a life, he says, pursue not only righteousness, not only little events of obedient, but let it be the godliness of your life.
[time=2131] Godliness, godlikeness, a descriptive term, really of that person's whole life. Not just actions from time to time, but a pattern of behavior.
[time=2142] So outwardly do right towards God and do it as a pattern. The next two virtues go inside, inside the heart and mind of an individual with faith and love.
[time=2151] And again, faith, not that faith by which we receive Christ into our life, but the faith that we walk in unshakeable confidence in God, God's character, God's plan, God's provision, God's program.
[time=2164] It's the stuff inside of an individual, the faith in God that allows him to stand up to incredible opposition and continue to be faithful to God.
[time=2173] Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego expressed this kind of faith when they stood before King Nebuchadnezzar, the most powerful man on the face of the earth.
[time=2180] They stood right by the huge furnace that was threatening to consume their very life and Nebuchadnezzar for their failure to bow before the golden image, which he had constructed on the plane of Dura gave these three Hebrews one more chance to bow down and worship, and they said no, we will not do this thing for our God is able to deliver us from the fiery furnace.
[time=2202] But it's a faith that also hangs on to God even if he chooses not to deliver, which is what they said, and they went on to say, "And even if our God does not deliver us from the fiery furnace, O King, we will not bow down to your image."
[time=2217] It's the faith of a man of God, and in Timothy's setting, even if he were to be overwhelmed by these false prophets, and even if the church at large were to turn against God and away from the truth,
[time=2228] Timothy in fighting the fight of faith would hang on to his God and not forsake God for money, but would stay pure and true in his heart of hearts.
[time=2240] To match the internal motive of faith is this word love agape, the love of choice, and the man of God is consumed by his choice to love God, to long for God, and even as David out in the desert would look at the panting deer who was ready to die of exhaustion for lack of water.
[time=2257] And David longing instead not for water, but for the presence of God and the tabernacle would say, "Oh, like the deer that pants so my heart pants for thee, O God."
[time=2269] The man of God is consumed and overwhelmed with a love for God, and because of that the love of God, Romans 5 has been shed abroad in his heart, and so he loves people, he loves the believers, and he loves the unbelievers, and he has God's heart for the world, desiring that none should perish, but all should come to eternal life.
[time=2286] So outwardly he's a man of righteousness and godliness.
[time=2290] Inwardly he is a man of profound faith and compelling love.
[time=2295] This next virtue, perseverance, is a compound word in the Greek, "Hupa-meno."
[time=2301] Hupa-meno, "Hupa-meno" means under, "meno" means to remain, so the difficult circumstances are here, and the godly man stays underneath, he remains underneath the trial, he remains underneath the difficulty.
[time=2315] It talks of staying power and endurance and long-suffering character.
[time=2321] And then concluding the virtue list is gentleness, which is a very difficult word for the English language, because the Greek word is so rich and full and meaning, but basically it speaks of an individual who has given up their rights, it is a selflessness, and it's a complete and total dedication to the cause of Christ.
[time=2340] A man's willingness, a woman's willingness to use his rights or to be used for the cause of Christ.
[time=2349] So Paul says, "Flee the evil, turn your back on the evil, but pursue righteousness."
[time=2356] Both of them, president imperatives, continually knowing that while running from, he is running to, while trying to escape something from behind, he is trying to overtake something in front of him, and he'll never catch it, he'll never have run far enough, he'll never have sought the virtues enough, he'll never out-distance what is wrong, and he'll never overtake what is fully right in his life.
[time=2377] So he runs, and she runs, and she never stops.
[time=2383] And you think of the men of God of old, and you think of Moses, 120 years, and how the book of Hebrews, chapter 11, tells us that Moses chose instead to enjoy the privilege of being called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, and all the privileges and rights that that would entitle him to,
[time=2401] a remarkably brilliant, handsome, charismatic individual by secondary birthright coming into the very palace of the most powerful man on the planet,
[time=2411] and all the privilege that that would give him instead chose to suffer ill reproach with the children of Israel.
[time=2417] He fled the things of the world, he fled the entrapments of the world, and chose instead to stand for God and the things of God.
[time=2424] And his life really is exemplified in two critical events, Exodus, chapter 32 and Numbers 14, for on both occasions the sin of the people was so odious on the side of God.
[time=2437] In Exodus, chapter 32, they had worshipped Baal through the molten calf and had been involved in all kinds of fertility, cult, and Orgy happening there at the base of Mount Sinai as Moses himself was receiving the tabloid of the Ten Commandments.
[time=2453] And later in Numbers, chapter 14, when the children of Israel had sent their twelve spies, this is after the Exodus, this is after Mount Sinai,
[time=2460] this is after the marvelous courtship of God for the people of Israel, when finally he leads them to the promised land, and ten spies come back and say they're too big, they're too strong.
[time=2470] On both of those occasions, God said to Moses, "Moses, stand out of my way, I will now destroy the people of Israel, and I will make you the new nation.
[time=2479] I will make you the man in whom the covenant of God will be used to reach the ends of the earth of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[time=2486] And in both cases, Moses said, "Lord, don't do that.
[time=2489] Don't do that." That would dishonor your name among the Gentiles.
[time=2493] They would say you brought the people out of Egypt only to slay them in the desert.
[time=2497] He stood up for the honor of God, and then in both cases he pleaded for mercy on the part of those who had been involved in the heinous sin.
[time=2505] He begged that God should pardon them. That's a man of great integrity.
[time=2509] That's a man who has been fleeing evil and pursuing righteousness, and godliness, and faith, and love, and perseverance, and gentleness, giving up his own rights for the cause of Christ.
[time=2522] It inspires Timothy to be such a man. So the man of God is known by what he flees from.
[time=2532] Secondly, he is known by what he fights for.
[time=2535] By what he fights for, verse 12, "Fight the good fight of faith."
[time=2542] The man of God is a fighter.
[time=2544] The man of God should see himself as a contender, as a protagonist, as one who stands against air and for the truth.
[time=2551] Paul uses many pictures in the New Testament to describe the competitive attitude that should be there.
[time=2556] In 1 Corinthians 9, he likens the Christian to running a race.
[time=2561] Also, to that of being a boxer in a ring, trying to duke it out for the truth.
[time=2566] In 1 Timothy 1, it's a military conflict in view. In 1 Timothy 4, it's a gymnastic contest.
[time=2573] But always, the spiritual dimensions are what our really in focus here is the man of God fights for the truth against air.
[time=2581] The man of God must fight against himself. He must fight against Satan, and his world system, and his demons, and his demon doctrines,
[time=2588] and the false teachers that propagate this demon doctrine, and the unsaved, and even the sin, and the apathy, and the disinterest of fellow believers.
[time=2599] Philippians 1, 29, Paul says this, "It has been granted to you to suffer for the sake of Christ, experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me and now here to be in me." What conflict did they see in the life of Paul at Philippi?
[time=2613] Paul was gracious enough to cast a demon spirit out of a possessed demon-slaved girl who was bringing much profit to her masters.
[time=2621] He brought the demon out of her, and then her masters took a hold of Paul, and without trial beat him and Silas, and threw them in prison.
[time=2630] So instead of a gracious response by the men for the wonderful deliverance of an enslaved demon-possessed girl, there is instead opposition.
[time=2641] Colossians 2-1, he talks about the great struggle that he has on their behalf, and for those who are at Laodicea.
[time=2648] The church at Colossi had been overwhelmed by an unbelievable amount of philosophy, and asceticism, and Gnosticism, and disbelief, and counter-doctrines of the truth.
[time=2661] And so there was a great conflict of doctrine there.
[time=2665] In Thessalonians 1 Thessalonians 2-2, he says, "The boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much opposition."
[time=2672] And you know, as you follow the missionary tours of Paul, that he was dogged every step of the way by Jewish antagonists who, as soon as Paul would land in a city and begin to preach the gospel, they would begin to cause all kinds of disturbances.
[time=2686] So wherever he went, whatever he did, whether physical, spiritual, or from the opposition in the Jews, he was fighting, fighting, fighting for the cause of Christ.
[time=2697] And it's reminiscent of the great Elijah who stood against King Ahab, the eighth king of Israel, and his Canaan wife, Jezebel, who had given her heart to the Phoenician gods, and Baal had taken the day by storm,
[time=2713] and there were more prophets and priests to Baal than to Yahweh, and the very altars of Yahweh were in disrepair because the focus and the energy had gone to Baal, and God sent Elijah.
[time=2726] And with him came a drought so that he could gain the attention of the people, and then a great showdown at Mount Carmel.
[time=2733] And remember they built two altars, and since Baal was the God of fire, he offered them to build and offer and put their, these priests of Baal and put their oxen on top of the altar and call upon their God.
[time=2746] And they did that all day, all day long they called upon their God and could not wake in his sympathy to their cause, as the people of Israel looked on to see who indeed was the true and living God.
[time=2756] So at the end of the day they began to cut themselves so that they could awaken their God to the cause but nothing.
[time=2763] Elijah rebuilt the altar of God which was in disrepair and put the animal there for sacrifice, then drenched it with water to ensure that no one would think anything silly had gone on.
[time=2775] Then he prayed and said, "Oh God, let them know the truth. Let them know that you are the true and the living God."
[time=2782] And of course he had no sooner finished his prayer than out of heaven came fire that consumed not just the animal of sacrifice but the stones and the wood and the water.
[time=2790] There was nothing left. And then Elijah sent the people in pursuit of the priests of Baal to kill them, for they were in opposition of the truth.
[time=2801] So he says, "Fight the good fight." As people of God we view ourselves as contenders of the faith. Jude says that faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.
[time=2814] You say, "How do I do that? How do I fight the good fight?" Well look again at verse 12, "By taking a hold of the eternal life to which you were called."
[time=2823] In other words, get a grip on eternity. Get a grip on the reality that you are here but for a brief moment in time and the greater duration if it could be called that of your existence will be after life and death after heaven and after earth and when you are in heaven in the presence of God.
[time=2838] But while there is still a fight, while there is still opportunity to bring souls to Christ and stand for the truth, fight.
[time=2845] Take a hold, get a grip of the eternal life which is yours. So often times we as Christians have the notion that our life should be comfortable, that we should be at peace with everybody, that we should just flow through life without opposition.
[time=2861] And there is no evidence of that in the lives of the men of God and Paul and Timothy. Something in us longs for the conditions of the Garden of Eden when all were at peace with each other and with God and even with creation.
[time=2874] And of course we long for that and we'll one day have it restored to us in heaven but in the interim it's a fight.
[time=2881] It's a battle for truth, it's a battle for integrity, it's a battle for our families, it's a battle to stand up for what is right.
[time=2891] So the man of God is known by what he flees from, secondly what he fights for and then thirdly what he is faithful to.
[time=2898] And this is fascinating, look at verse 14, saying that you keep the commandment without stain or reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2909] How long should I stay faithful until the appearing of Christ? The word appearing is the word epiphany or epiphany in the Greek from which we get our word epiphany and it describes the very first hint of dawn, dawning of the sun, the sun of God.
[time=2927] He is saying stay faithful to your ministry Timothy and tell the appearing of the sun of God dawns on the horizon.
[time=2935] 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 describes what will happen at the epiphany of Christ, the very first thing that will happen at the appearing of Christ at the end of the age is the antichrist will be slain.
[time=2946] The very one who embodies all the deception and the lies and the falsehood against which Timothy has been called to stand.
[time=2954] So these are words of great encouragement to Timothy, in other words saying you are weary and well doing and it's difficult to stand against the opposition of this world system and the demon doctrines and its infiltration to the church but know this Timothy.
[time=2969] Keep the commandment pure without stain or approach until Jesus Christ appears for his first appearance, not the rapture but his second coming at the end of the age.
[time=2980] He will smote the antichrist with the breath of his mouth and the conflict will end.
[time=2992] So be faithful, be faithful because there is an end, it is in sight and it comes not through further struggle and toil but just at the mere appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3002] And secondly fight to the end because of your serving your God. Look at verse 13, this is wonderful.
[time=3011] He says I charge you in the presence of God and then describes this God as the one who gives life to all things and of Christ Jesus who testified the good confession before a Pontius Pilate.
[time=3022] So in verse 12 Paul highlights Timothy's confession of faith. At the end of verse 12 stay faithful to the good confession which you made in the presence of many witnesses.
[time=3033] Look at what he's saying here, he's saying Timothy you made a confession of a God who is the life giver of all things and so did Jesus.
[time=3040] And as Jesus even in the presence of Pontius Pilate on the verge of his own death and by that confession really sealing his own crucifixion by admitting in fact that he was God.
[time=3051] And as Jesus made that confession and found himself faithful all the rest of throughout the entirety of his life even to the point of death he served a God however who was the God who gives life to all.
[time=3063] And so of course he calls to Timothy's mind the power of the resurrection whereby Christ was raised from the dead.
[time=3070] Timothy stay faithful in your ministry all the way to death because you've made a confession to the same God as Christ and it happens to be a life giving God.
[time=3084] So it's a powerful message of encouragement it's a powerful message of uplifting grace and support.
[time=3096] And as you think about faithfulness as you think about stability and ministry in the men of old and the men of God of the Old Testament my mind runs to Samuel the great prophet Samuel who before even his birth was faithful to God because he was so dedicated by his mother Hannah
[time=3111] prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and prayed and then at the earliest possible age was taken there to the temple.
[time=3116] But he was taken to the temple to be faithful to men who were unfaithful Eli Haphne and Finnehaz the high priest and his two sons who were desecrating the altar desecrating the sacrifices and who in fact were leading the nation of Israel away from God but here the little boy Samuel somehow
[time=3135] refusing to be incorporated in that kind of view of God polluted in his soul he stayed pure and true he was the one who brought in the monarchy he anointed Saul and then took him out of the ministry as he proved unfaithful as a king he later anointed David
[time=3150] and all of his life he had one strong sturdy message to the people of Israel he said over and over again turn not aside from following the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart.
[time=3162] That was his message to the people and that was the message to his own life and as you survey the pages of holy writ you will not find one of greater faithfulness and Samuel and he too will be risen from the dead and all of us who will be in heaven will see him
[time=3186] before he entrusted himself to a God who was the giver of life so the marks of the man or the woman of God he is marked by what he flees from and I would say by way of application as we draw our time to a conclusion this morning
[time=3206] I don't know where you are in your life today I don't know how short your check is running at the end of every month I don't know how eminent the loss of your job may be how difficult your life may be in the home with spouse or children
[time=3222] I don't know the kind of calamity that may be in your life but I want to call you to flee from evil and not view evil as a respite from the difficulty of life but as a dangerous life threatening reality and turn your back and run as fast and as hard as you can straight into the virtues of righteousness and godliness and faith and love and perseverance and gentleness
[time=3251] what are the sins that plagued your life are you accountable to someone are you talking with those people or are you isolated in your sin then sure to fail and all I can say to you is if you don't flee
[time=3266] if you don't take the opportunity that God has given you to flee then the very sin which you toy with almost like standing by a campfire looking at its warmth and thinking I'll never jump in but sin will have its way with you
[time=3277] and when it's done and when it's destroyed your character and your life and your relationships and your reputation and your service for the cause of Christ it will be as if someone drops a curtain and you'll finally see it for what it is
[time=3290] a destructive elusive promise that offers some passing pleasure but in the end will pierce you skewer you like the animal on a skewer and it will pierce your soul with many a pain turn from it and run
[time=3309] and I don't know what you're fighting for most of us are fighting for something some of us spend our lives fighting for our rights some of us spend our lives fighting for our rights inside of our marriage inside of our jobs inside of our family relationships
[time=3323] and it's one long imbittered struggle for me and for my rights and for my place in the sun and God would say fight for truth fight for faith fight for the faith once for all delivered use your energy and your time and your resources not to fight for your own rights but to fight for the cause of Christ and be willing to give your rights up for the same cause
[time=3351] faithful to what are you faithful to what is the consuming passion of your life as you look back is it God is it the people of God or have you been faithful instead to some subordinate goals some worldly purpose
[time=3368] it only robs your life of energy and strength and in the end will leave you a sorry person
[time=3377] the call to arms a letter full of encouragement a letter full of hoping that a man and a woman would be all that God could call them to be you man of God
