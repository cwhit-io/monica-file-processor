[time=0] And so wealth and the definition of wealth and what it means to be rich is definitely a relative term.
[time=8] Let me give you a definition that I think is helpful to understand whether or not you are rich.
[time=12] It would be this, you are rich if you have more than you need.
[time=29] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=35] Thank you for joining us.
[time=37] In his advice to the rich, Paul exhorts them to fix their hope not on their wealth, but on God who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.
[time=46] Whether you consider yourself wealthy or not, Paul's words are equally applicable.
[time=51] God is to be at the very center of our focus and the determining factor and the use of our finances.
[time=58] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy.
[time=62] We will be looking at chapter 6 verses 17 through 19.
[time=68] We know you will enjoy today's special music, which will be provided by our special guests Dan and Donna Oxley.
[time=76] Let's now join our service.
[time=79] Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine.
[time=83] You know, there's no condemnation in Jesus Christ.
[time=87] The Bible says you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
[time=117] The truth, the broken part where hope has died, leaves no escape, years of anger are
[time=138] locked in you, steals somehow you believe it's true, God is greater, he calls to you
[time=160] as your Savior, greater, and even in your heart tells you God is greater than your heart.
[time=182] The way to try is calling you from the fear that you're failing here, beyond the lies,
[time=207] your God is true, and He won't come dead, there's a voice from your Father's eyes.
[time=228] He offers you the heart, God is greater, he calls to you as your Savior, and even in
[time=256] your heart tells you God is greater, God is greater, God is greater than your heart.
[time=280] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=520] [APPLAUSE]
[time=530] I'm thankful for the ministry of Dan and Donna Oxley, we'll be hearing from them again in just a minute.
[time=535] Friend Day is coming up at Black Hawk Baptist Church, that's on September 13th.
[time=540] We'll be privileged to have Steve, Maria, and Mandy Gardner.
[time=544] They now live in Colorado and they'll be back in Fort Wayne, their hometown, to be with us on that Sunday morning, September 13th, with one service at 10 a.m.
[time=554] Come and join us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=557] And we'll have a special concert on, that's Friday evening, September 18th at 8 o'clock.
[time=563] Tickets are on sale at local bookstores for the concert with Ray Bolz.
[time=568] Friday evening, 8 o'clock, September 18th.
[time=572] And then finally, we've been offering this month a book on why is Christianity true?
[time=577] There are six points in the book that prove the validity of Christianity.
[time=581] We'd like to have you receive this book by simply writing to the Bible hour.
[time=586] At 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=593] This is the last time we'll be offering this booklet, you can receive it absolutely free by writing to the Bible hour.
[time=599] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=606] We go back to the live portion of our service now with more music and then the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=614] For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[time=623] For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world, through Him, might be saved.
[time=636] [MUSIC]
[time=670] Still we keep on thinking, somebody else will go.
[time=676] Our world is dying, urgently needs to know.
[time=682] If we will lovingly compare, we'll storm the very gates again.
[time=689] Hmm, we'll go.
[time=695] Going to the world, take His love into the world.
[time=701] The time is right, the fields are won't.
[time=704] There's work to do before the night, so we'll go into the world, take His love into the world.
[time=713] He is calling me a new into the world.
[time=721] â™ª
[time=729] Be the great condition, go 'bout and let the sea.
[time=735] Labor ring together, in time we will succeed.
[time=740] His love has meant for us to share to every people everywhere.
[time=748] Hmm, we'll go.
[time=754] Going to the world, take His love into the world.
[time=760] The time is right, the fields are won't.
[time=763] There's work to do before the night, so we'll go into the world, take His love into the world.
[time=772] He is calling me a new into the world.
[time=778] How would you do that?
[time=780] There's a god who loves it, but how could the library gave their sight?
[time=784] How could the last light hold us?
[time=787] We tell them we are giving us all tonight.
[time=791] Look to the fields, you'll see the bombs ready, they serve as a god who must obey.
[time=797] All the world will go, the Father loves it.
[time=800] If we are all in point away, go into the world, take His love into the world.
[time=810] The time is right, the fields are won't.
[time=813] There's work to do before the night, so we'll go into the world,
[time=819] take His love into the world.
[time=823] He is calling me a new.
[time=829] Yes, He is calling me a new into the world.
[time=834] He is going to the world, take His love into the world.
[time=841] The time is right, the fields are won't.
[time=845] There's work to do before the night, so we'll go into the world, take His love into the world.
[time=855] He is calling me a new into the world.
[time=867] The time is right, the fields are won't.
[time=872] So we'll go into the world, take His love into the world.
[time=879] He is calling me a new.
[time=885] Yes, He is calling me a new into the world.
[time=909] [AMEN] Thank you, Donna and Don, beautiful, beautiful music and a tremendous song.
[time=915] The first service I told, Dan, I'd never seen anybody play a trumpet and make it hit higher notes than that, and that I'd also never seen a guy's face turn more red.
[time=926] He told me it doesn't hurt, it's not bad for him, but man, it's an incredible amount of pressure.
[time=930] You put on that horn to make it do such good things.
[time=933] What great stories about your past in a missionary's kid and being a part of that?
[time=937] I'm thankful that you're using that incredible talent for God.
[time=940] Thank you for coming this morning.
[time=942] Well, if you have your Bibles, let me invite you to take them and turn probably for the last time to the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=949] We've been spending a great number of months walking our way through this book trying to understand what God has said through Paul to the young man Timothy at the church at Ephesus.
[time=962] Verses 17, 18, and 19 of chapter 6, let me read them and will you follow along.
[time=968] Instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.
[time=981] Instruct them to do good and to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed.
[time=996] The theme of this passage is at the beginning of verse 17, and it's talking about those who are rich in this present world, in this day, in this age.
[time=1007] And the instruction given in this passage differs from previous weeks when we looked at verses 6 and following.
[time=1014] Verse 9 talks about those who want to get rich.
[time=1018] And verse 10 talks about those who have the love of money.
[time=1022] These folks don't necessarily have money, they just want to get rich, they've made a decision to become rich and it's so engrossed itself and their personality and their life that it's become the passion of their life, the love of money.
[time=1035] What we come to this morning is to talk about people who are rich, people who do have money, people who are wealthy, and Paul gives instruction to them.
[time=1045] And he does this because in verses 6 through 11, he talked about what money cannot do.
[time=1053] You remember in verse 6 he said that money cannot buy contentment, money cannot substantially change the quality of your life.
[time=1061] In verse 7 he said that money cannot prepare you for eternity.
[time=1065] In verse 8 he said that money cannot take you back to the simplicity of life with food and covering be content, to drive the emphasis of life back to people and relationships instead of things and money.
[time=1078] He said that's what money can't do.
[time=1080] And then he went on to say what the love of money surely will do in verses 9 and 10.
[time=1085] He said if you make a mental decision, make it your life purpose to get rich, you'll put yourself on a path that leads to ruin and destruction.
[time=1094] It goes like this, you fall into temptation, then you become caught in the snare.
[time=1099] It says if you're an animal in a trap and you can't break free of it in your own power, there are many foolish and harmful desires which eventually plunge the person into ruin and destruction.
[time=1110] That's a guarantee.
[time=1111] If you set your life after that, you inevitably put yourself on that path and that will be the end of your life.
[time=1117] Verse 10, not only the decision to get rich, but then the passion, the love, the consuming thing that fills your heart and mind day in and day out, as you really believe that money can make the difference.
[time=1128] And that becomes the root of all sorts of evil.
[time=1131] Some by longing for it have wandered away from the faith and then pierced themselves or skewered themselves through with many a pain.
[time=1138] From the top of your soul to the bottom of your soul, you drive a shaft of pain through your very life.
[time=1145] That's what money will surely do or rather the love of money will surely do.
[time=1150] And so in Paul's mind, there were obviously some in the assembly who had money and he didn't want them to go away with the impression that money is intrinsically bad or that money is evil and that they have money is wrong.
[time=1163] And so verses 17 to 19 give instruction to the rich.
[time=1167] If you're wealthy, this is what you are to do with your money.
[time=1170] If you have discretionary income, these are the words that apply to you.
[time=1176] And if you're taking notes this morning, we're going to talk about the profile of the rich, the pitfalls of the rich, and the profit of the rich.
[time=1184] The profile, the pitfalls, and the profit.
[time=1187] And we begin there in verse 17 with the profile of the rich.
[time=1192] Instruct those who are rich in this present world.
[time=1197] Now, getting a grasp on an understanding of who is rich and who is poor is sometimes difficult.
[time=1204] Who were the rich then?
[time=1206] Well, if you go back to chapter 6, you'll notice in verse 2 that some of the Christian slaves in the Church of Ephesus had believing masters.
[time=1214] Onesimus and Philemon give description to the notion that even in the early church
[time=1220] there were believers who were wealthy enough to own other people to own slaves.
[time=1225] The early church met in houses and it no doubt found its way as it grew to the larger houses of the believers in that particular church.
[time=1233] And so even as this letter was being read and instructed, it may have been in the several homes in the city of Ephesus making up the one church at Ephesus, the largest homes, the most expensive homes, because for practical reasons the most of us could fit in that particular home.
[time=1248] But it's difficult to identify what would have made a person rich or poor in that particular generation.
[time=1253] So let's think about it in our own day.
[time=1255] What makes a person rich today?
[time=1258] I was reading in Fortune magazine December of 1990.
[time=1262] They said there to be considered rich in America today, you need over a million dollars in assets and you need to make over $300,000 a year.
[time=1271] That would be the standard in their mind of rich in America today.
[time=1275] The article went on to say that we have some 58 billionaires in the United States of America,
[time=1281] over a thousand families worth over a hundred million dollars, and literally tens of thousands of families that have a net worth of over $10 million.
[time=1292] I read another article, US News and World Report November '91.
[time=1298] Ask the question, are you in the upper crust?
[time=1301] Where does your family combine family income put you in relationship to everybody else in the United States of America?
[time=1308] Well, if you want to be in the top 1% annual income, you need to make over $620,000 a year.
[time=1316] But it changes rather rapidly from there.
[time=1318] If you want to be in the top 5%, your family income would be $95,000 or above.
[time=1324] So if your family makes $95,000 or above, you're in the top 5%.
[time=1342] You make more than over half the people in the United States of America if your family makes more than $30,000.
[time=1348] And that's, of course, all relative to the United States of America.
[time=1352] You could compare yourself to Vietnam, one of the poorest and technologically backward countries of the world,
[time=1358] the annual per capita income, there is $160 a year.
[time=1364] Now, we all just got our kids clothed for school, and we wish it would have been as little as $160.
[time=1371] So we're spending more on our kids just to get them ready to go back to school than some people,
[time=1377] most of the people in the world will make in an entire year.
[time=1381] So wealth is relative.
[time=1383] And to try to give an absolute term to wealth is difficult, but allow me to take a stab at one.
[time=1389] Look at verse 8, chapter 6 verse 8, it says there, "If we have food and covering, with these we shall be content or satisfied."
[time=1399] So that might be the basis, that might be the basic beginning.
[time=1403] If you have food and covering, you're content.
[time=1406] So if you have anything more than that, you're wealthy.
[time=1409] If you have more than the, what it takes to supply the bare essentials of food and covering,
[time=1415] you have wealth or you could be classified in the group of the rich.
[time=1420] And some of you say, "Well, now, wait a minute.
[time=1423] By the time I'm done making the house payment and paying the payments on the cars
[time=1429] and the insurance that goes with them and the food and the clothing, I'm out of money."
[time=1435] And so you say, "Well, then this can't apply to me because at the end of every month I'm out." And I would say maybe, but maybe not, because in the process of choosing your house and your car or your cars,
[time=1446] and all that comes with that, the clothing and the food and the rest that you call your standard of living, you've made a significant number of choices.
[time=1453] I don't think very many of us are living in the least expensive house we can find,
[time=1459] the very least expensive form of covering, with the smallest number of items in our wardrobe and those being the least expensive,
[time=1467] nor our food, would we consider ourselves to be eating the bare raw essentials of what it takes to maintain a life.
[time=1474] So while our standard of living may exhaust our check at the end of every month or our income at the end of every year,
[time=1482] we would have to recognize that there are a great number of choices above bare minimum that move us in that direction
[time=1488] and which then indeed exhaust that money.
[time=1490] So I don't want to let anybody off the hook this morning.
[time=1493] I think that depending upon who you compare yourself to, you're either poor or you're rich, and so let's compare ourselves to those who have less and then listen to this passage with light of that.
[time=1504] Now what I like about this passage is that it does not call us to live at the very base level of existence.
[time=1510] There's nothing in this passage nor anywhere else in the Bible that exalts a level of spirituality or a way of life
[time=1516] that gets by with the very bare minimum.
[time=1520] It's not there. This passage is not a command to give away all of our money.
[time=1524] It's not a command to become a stoic. It's not a command to take a vow of poverty.
[time=1529] This is in no way calling us to some monastic way of life.
[time=1533] It's not even trying to make us feel guilty for the money that we have.
[time=1538] Instead, it's trying to give us much needed instruction as to what to do with the wealth that God has so graciously given to us.
[time=1545] And so what is that instruction? Well, it begins in verse 17 with the pitfalls of wealth.
[time=1552] Verse 17, instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited, not to be conceited, not to be high-minded,
[time=1562] not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think based upon the fact that you have more money than other people have.
[time=1569] There's something odd. There's something wicked. There's something depraved about us as human beings, redeemed though we may be,
[time=1576] that can allow us to ascribe intrinsic value to ourselves because we have more than somebody else.
[time=1583] And I look in my own life for ample examples of this wicked attitude.
[time=1589] But when we lived in California, we were invited on an annual basis to go to a wonderful professional tennis tournament
[time=1596] that would have happened in Palm Springs every year. And we went at the invitation of my brother-in-law and sister and the Lord has greatly blessed them in the financial arena.
[time=1604] And so he has these gorgeous box seats right there at center court and with those box seats comes a parking pass.
[time=1611] And I'll never forget time and time again the sickening attitude that filled my soul as we would drive up to this big hotel and tennis stadium.
[time=1620] And we would see the masses, the poor mindless masses who had to park hither and yawn and then walk in long hoards and lines into the tennis stadium
[time=1631] while we in his big expensive luxury car pulled up to the front and we were then helped out of our car and then taken into the stadium
[time=1639] and we sat there in the priority seats while all the peons of life sat up in the stadium there so far away.
[time=1647] And you look at yourself and you say you are sick. You are sick.
[time=1651] There is nothing about what just happened that makes you any better than anybody else in this whole place.
[time=1658] And the peculiar oddity in my situation is that wasn't even my money. I mean that was his money.
[time=1665] But just because I'm associated with it then somehow I'm privileged or better intrinsically and that is the danger of wealth.
[time=1674] That is the thing that seeps into the soul of the human being that says because I have the latest stuff, the newest equipment, the best place to eat.
[time=1683] We only dine in the finer places and my clothing is bought at such and such a place that all of that somehow means that bottom line I'm better than you are.
[time=1692] I'm conceited. I think more highly of myself than I ought to think.
[time=1698] So that is a danger. That is a pitfall of wealth.
[time=1703] And it also is true typically that when I am among those who have wealth then I seek out those who also have wealth.
[time=1710] And so I associate with the wealthy because we have interests and opportunities and we work in circles that are distinctly different and so there is no room in our life for a relationship with the common people.
[time=1722] And what exists then is a coalition of the conceited, the coalition of the high-minded, the coalition of the proud.
[time=1729] And there is no room in fact instead of disdain for friendship with people who don't have as much money.
[time=1735] That's the pitfall. That's the warning.
[time=1737] Instruct them not to do that. Do not be conceited.
[time=1742] Wealth can lead an individual to make distinctions about the intrinsic essence of an individual on artificial differences.
[time=1750] And money is an artificial difference.
[time=1754] Instead we would be better to evaluate people not on what they have but on who they are, right?
[time=1760] Their character, their truthfulness, their honesty, their stability, their faithfulness, the quality of their relationships, how they treat their wife, how they treat their kids, how they treat the people that they know.
[time=1773] We should evaluate them on their vision for God and the kingdom of God and in no matter what vocation they find themselves, the contribution they are making to the kingdom of God.
[time=1784] Those aren't those the things you're supposed to evaluate people on and then think highly of them or lowly of them and most importantly shouldn't that be the ultimate criteria by which we evaluate ourselves?
[time=1795] Do I love God? Do I love Christ? Am I a servant? Am I committed to the people in my world?
[time=1801] Am I honest? Am I trustworthy? Am I faithful?
[time=1804] That should be the stuff that is the grid through which I make myself pass in order to think highly or lowly of myself.
[time=1812] And beyond even that, I'll go a step further. I think when we look at other people and evaluate them, it shouldn't be for whether or not I want to be in relationship with them.
[time=1821] I shouldn't look at people and say, "Hmm, yes, I'll be in a relationship with you. You qualify. You meet these certain standards."
[time=1829] Instead, it should be the attitude of Christ which looks at another person, sees the weakness, sees the ugliness, sees the need and then pursues that person because they need you.
[time=1839] And it is instead your privilege to give. It is your privilege to associate. It is your privilege to try to complete what is lacking in that other person.
[time=1847] That's the basis upon which we should evaluate another person and seek to be involved in their life.
[time=1852] Philippians 2.3 says, "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, let each one of you regard one another as more important than himself."
[time=1863] That's the attitude. So, the first pitfall of wealth doesn't mean that everybody's wealthy has this problem.
[time=1870] It's just a problem that tends to come with wealth is the tendency to be conceited, to have a false evaluation of other people and it will rob you of genuine relationship for the cause of Christ.
[time=1881] The second reason is also found in verse 17 and this one directs itself not to your relationship with people but your relationship with God.
[time=1890] Verse 17 instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceited or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches but on God who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy.
[time=1904] In other words, wealth brings the propensity, the likelihood to take the trust that we should have completely and totally fixed on God himself and to transfer that trust into the uncertainty of riches.
[time=1919] God is replaced by an estate planner. God is replaced by a retirement plan. God is replaced by net worth. And when I think I have enough and when I think it's sufficient, then I eventually allow myself to drift into setting and fixing and maintaining my fix of hope on wealth rather than God.
[time=1941] It's independence. Now I have enough to ensure that my life will go the way I want to go. In one of the articles I was reading this week about wealth, they defined wealth this way.
[time=1951] Quote, wealth can be defined as independence and opportunity and the amount of control someone has over his own life. Now that is absolutely the antithesis of the Christian experience.
[time=1967] The Christian experience is dependence, not independence. The Christian experience is falling down, prostrate in heart and mind before a holy and a righteous and a sovereign God saying my life is yours. Do whatever you want with it.
[time=1981] The Christian life is not one of gaining opportunity for indulgence, but of servitude, looking for opportunity to serve. And then the amount of control someone has over his own life?
[time=1992] No, no, no, no, no, no. Jesus Christ is Lord of my life. I have given him absolute sovereign control. And the last thing I want is to allow the money that he may have graciously given me to turn and to twist my view of reality into the place that I am now independent.
[time=2009] I have opportunity to do what I want, when I want, and I have absolute control over my life. So even the world when it describes its own longing for wealth speaks in direct opposition to what the text says.
[time=2023] Don't fix your hope on the uncertainty of riches but on God who richly supplies all things to enjoy. It's reminiscent of the man in Luke chapter 12 who was being blessed by God and his crops continue to multiply and his current warehouse was not sufficient.
[time=2040] And so he said to himself, we're going to build bigger barns. And so he does that. And then he fills all these new and expanded barns with all the wealth he can muster. And then when he's done all that, he says, soul, it's time now to eat, drink, and be merry.
[time=2055] In other words, it's time to live for yourself. It's time to live for the here and now. It's time to be self-directing and autonomous in your pursuits of life because you now have enough stockpile to ensure that no matter what may happen, you don't have to work another day in your life.
[time=2069] And you can guarantee the kind of life that you want. Proverbs 11, 28 says this, "He who trusts in his riches will fall." And that's true.
[time=2081] We were not created to trust in riches. We were created to trust in God and serve him and love other people.
[time=2087] So the money gives a pseudo sense of independence from God. And wealth, it's true, can alleviate some of the obstacles and some of the difficulties of life.
[time=2101] Sometimes when you have a lot of money, you can kind of remove yourself and really insulate yourself from some of the more traumatic and difficult things of life that drive the rest of us back to God.
[time=2111] Let me show you an example of this. Come with me if you will. Keep your place there in 1 Timothy. We'll be back. But Psalm 73, Psalm 73 describes a man who loves God and who is trying to serve God, but who sees in the ease and the prosperity of the wicked, a great quandary.
[time=2133] It's very instructive. Psalm 73. Let's begin at verse 1 there. Surely God is good to Israel to those who are pure in heart.
[time=2144] But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling. My steps had almost slipped. For I was envious of the arrogant and I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
[time=2154] In other words, I honor God, verse 1. But verse 2, my feet almost stumbled. In fact, I almost slipped. I almost fell completely out of the will of God.
[time=2163] Why? Verse 3, "I was envious of the arrogant and I saw the prosperity of the wicked." Then he describes it. Verses 4 and 5.
[time=2169] For there are no pains in their death, and their body is fat. They are not in trouble as other men. They are not plagued like mankind.
[time=2178] You see, their wealth allows them to receive the very, very best in medical care. Their wealth allows them to drive to the very front of the stadium and be ushered in.
[time=2188] Their wealth allows them to live in the nicest and the safest parts of town, so they are not subject to the crime and some of the difficult things that go maybe in the inner city.
[time=2198] Their wealth allows them the best of education, and so they can pursue the best of jobs and perpetuate this standard of living from generation to generation.
[time=2207] And those without money don't enjoy those kinds of things. So he describes it in verse 4. There is pain in their death. Their body is not fat.
[time=2214] It's lean. We're scavenging for the next bite. And we do have trouble. We do have a great difficulty functioning in society because we don't have the kind of money that could lift us above the common ordinary.
[time=2227] Point. Verse 6. What does it produce in them? Therefore pride is their necklace. The garment of violence covers them. The eye bulges from fatness.
[time=2238] The imaginations of their heart run riot. They mock and wickedly speak of oppression. They speak from on high. They have set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue parades through the earth.
[time=2248] Therefore his people return to this place and waters of abundance are drunk by them. Now verse 11. And they say how does God know?
[time=2258] And is their knowledge with the most high? In other words, this man feels free to be proud in his own heart. That pride leads to the oppression of the innocent.
[time=2269] Verse 8. They speak wickedly and speak of oppression. Which, as you know from Old Testament history, the wealthier the nation of Israel got, the more oppression inflicted on the poorer in its own nation.
[time=2281] And they are judged in the minor prophets over and over and over again for oppressively using their wealth and dominating a society.
[time=2288] And if you want a taste of that in the New Testament, read James chapter 5 where it says that the wages that you should have paid to the labor is now crying out against you in the day of judgment because you have become so arrogant with your wealth.
[time=2298] You have failed to even properly remunerate those who have worked for you and that failure to do that that unjustness now cries for your own judgment.
[time=2307] So they fall into this snare of pride and then the violation of people and then by verse 11 they say how does God know?
[time=2315] And is there any knowledge with the most high? They even call into question the omniscience and the omnipotence of the one and true holy God.
[time=2324] So it's a dangerous thing. It's a pitfall and we who are wealthy, all of us at least in comparison to other third world nations of the world would be wise to caution and to look and to examine the degree to which we fail in that area.
[time=2340] Verse 13. He says this.
[time=2342] Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocent for I have been stricken all day long and chastened my, and chastened every morning.
[time=2351] He says why should I have followed God? Why should I have kept my heart pure? That's why he's almost stumbled because he sees his life.
[time=2359] He's stricken all day long. He's chastened every morning. Needless to say by the basic course of affairs that goes on in his life without the money to be a little more stable.
[time=2370] Verse 15. If I had said I will speak thus behold I should have betrayed the generation of thy children. Verse 16.
[time=2377] When I pondered to understand this it was troublesome in my sight until I came into the sanctuary of God.
[time=2385] Then I perceived their end the unjust right, the unjust rich.
[time=2390] Verse 18. Surely thou dost set them in slippery places, thou dost cast them down to destruction how they are destroyed in a moment they are utterly set away by sudden terrors.
[time=2401] Now that's not all rich. All rich are not unrighteous rich. There are very many righteous rich who are very gracious and abundant in what they do for the cause of Christ.
[time=2410] He describes here the end of the wicked rich. And then he reaffirms his values in verse 25. "Whom have I in heaven thee, and besides thee I desire nothing on earth.
[time=2420] My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever." He says that is the greatest inheritance, that is the greatest wealth, and he is the one in whom I have placed my hope.
[time=2434] Verse 28. "But as for me the nearness of God is my good, and I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of all thy works."
[time=2444] So you see here the honest struggle of the believer without wealth who recognizes that wealth does enhance life in some categories and in some ways and that it can insulate, but it is not the thing to be trusted in for when it is trusted in then oppression and then a mocking of the very God who gave the wealth.
[time=2463] Back to 1 Timothy.
[time=2467] "Instruct those who are rich, not to fall into these pitfalls, the one high-mindedness, and the other to fix hope on the uncertainty of riches."
[time=2479] Proverbs 23.5 says that wealth certainly makes itself wings like an eagle that flies towards the heavens. Wealth is elusive, wealth can disappear, wealth can take off and fly away, whether through the destruction of war or a depression or the changing of an economy to be emphasized in one area rather than another area and yours is the area that's getting left behind.
[time=2505] Whether bad partnerships, whether the loss of a job, the thief, riches can fly away from you, don't put your trust in them.
[time=2515] And to do so reveals a tragic misunderstanding of life and reality.
[time=2521] What do I mean?
[time=2523] Haggai 28 says this, "The silver is mine and the gold is mine declares the Lord." Now he's talking to all the nations of the world.
[time=2531] What God is saying is I own everything, all the silver, all the gold, anything of value, anything of wealth, whatever it is I own it.
[time=2539] Deuteronomy 8, 18 he says, "I give the power to make wealth." So what happens is the people make by the power that God has given him the wealth that is truly God's and then instead of being grateful and maintaining a disposition of dependence and servantness they fix their hope on the wealth and become proud in that and are useless than to God.
[time=2565] So we are reminded this morning of though the goodness of God, it brings with it great responsibility, not to become conceited and not to change our hope.
[time=2575] What is the prophet in wealth? If those are the pitfalls, what is the prophet? What is to be good in the wealth? Look at verse 18.
[time=2583] It says there, "Instruct them to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share."
[time=2592] And the word good there is not describing a superficial good, not a shallow good, but noble things, excellent things, quality things in the eyes of God.
[time=2603] Take the disposable discretionary income that is yours and use it for noble things, excellent things, quality things.
[time=2611] You say, "Well, what would those be?" Well, go back a chapter.
[time=2615] Chapter 5 verse 8, it says, "If anyone does not provide for his own house, especially for those in his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
[time=2625] The first noble, the first excellent, the first quality thing to do with money is to provide for your own household, to provide for your wife and your kids.
[time=2633] And of course, the context here is widows, so potentially an extended family member, a mother or a mother-in-law or a father or a father-in-law or an aunt.
[time=2643] People who are related to you, who are financially destitute, become your responsibility to care for them.
[time=2650] And if you don't, you've denied the faith, you're worse than an unbeliever.
[time=2654] It says in verse 3, "Honor widows who are widows indeed." The word honor means not just an attitude, but also financial support.
[time=2662] Give financial support to widows. Well, how does that differ?
[time=2665] These are widows that aren't even a part of your family.
[time=2668] There is no relationship. Bloodline wise, they're just godly women.
[time=2671] They're called widows indeed. They meet the qualifications we taught on when we went through that passage.
[time=2676] A noble use of your money is to support them.
[time=2679] It says over in verse 17, same chapter, "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching."
[time=2688] So the notion is honor again more than just respect, but financial support. Support your church.
[time=2694] Support your ministry. Support a mission agency. Support a parrot church organization where the work of Jesus Christ is being propagated.
[time=2700] Those are the noble works.
[time=2702] And of course, Acts chapter 2 and Acts chapter 4 describe people giving money to each other who aren't related, and they aren't widows indeed.
[time=2710] And they're not even people in the ministry. They're just fellow believers in need.
[time=2714] Fellow believers in need. Help them out.
[time=2718] I just have such fond memories of the ways that people have done that for Heidi and I throughout our lives.
[time=2725] I remember our first anniversary, and at that time we were in seminary, and Randy had already come along, and we were fast running out of money.
[time=2734] When we were married, we had two cars, we'd sent sold the one to keep paying things, you know, and we both had a bank account, and we added all that, and that eventually had been gone.
[time=2742] And we were just down to that bare nub necessity stuff, you know, that seminary and oftentimes college and graduate students are involved in.
[time=2750] And our anniversary was coming up in the day before our anniversary.
[time=2754] We had been in public, and Heidi went to pick up the diaper bag, and right there in the diaper bag was a $20 bill.
[time=2760] And that was obviously by some people that knew that our anniversary was coming, and they wanted us to splurge, and kind of have a good time.
[time=2766] And we reflect on that night with great warmness of heart, not just because we got to go out, but because somebody still identified to us, cared enough to take some discretionary income and pass it along.
[time=2781] A little bit later on in the ministry there, we were given a trip to Hawaii.
[time=2786] I don't know, this person in our church had received a trip to Hawaii, and they didn't want it, so they gave it to us.
[time=2791] And we kind of looked at our life and felt like we'd been given enough, and we wanted to give something along to somebody else.
[time=2797] And there was a couple that was working in our ministry, and they had a number of kids, and they were not strapped because it was that time of life as one being educated.
[time=2806] They just were struggling in life. They'd never had a trip like that, and so Heidi and I gave that trip to them.
[time=2811] And we now have some really good friends. You know how that is.
[time=2815] And we now probably enjoy their friendship more than we would have enjoyed the trip.
[time=2820] Noble use of money. Pass it along. I think about a man who came alongside Dr. MacArthur and the first several years of the Master's College existence.
[time=2829] And when John became president of the Master's College, the college was in debt. The college had its line of credit, extended all the way out to the very end.
[time=2835] It was a very bleak picture, and that's why they needed a new president to come and try to reverse that.
[time=2840] And the Lord brought a guy into John's life that gave $25 million to the college in a five-year period.
[time=2849] That's a lot of money. That built a lot of dorms. That built a lot of classrooms.
[time=2854] That built a lot of publicity for the college and scholarships, and students went overseas to start our overseas missions project.
[time=2862] And all the things faculty members were hired, and it allowed the college to get them its feet and now stand very strongly, even without that kind of help.
[time=2870] Noble works. Whether they be with individuals, whether they be with the ministry, whether they just be to friends, and of course I think of the faithful giving that you all do on a regular basis to support the ministry of this church.
[time=2881] Where you have an enormous budget and enormous amounts of expenses, and you faithfully continue to have a noble cause for your discretionary income.
[time=2891] So that's what he's saying. Verse 18 instruct them to do good, to be involved in noble things with their extra money, and to be rich in that stuff.
[time=2900] Be rich. Stockpile those good works. Build those up. Now it's difficult when you talk about money, obviously.
[time=2910] Especially when you talk about stockpiling things. Verse 19 says, "Storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future."
[time=2917] That's talking about a fund, a spiritual fund that is contributed to on a regular basis by the way you use your money and the here and now.
[time=2925] And the call of the Christian is to build his riches in heaven, his future retirement plan should be viewed as longer than life and really reaching into eternity.
[time=2937] And of course anytime you get in that area it's very difficult because the Bible talks about planning ahead for today, I mean for the needs of this day and age.
[time=2944] We're not to be presumptuous, we're not to give all of our money away so that we have none for ourselves.
[time=2949] That's when the roof has a leak and you have nothing to fix it or there's an education that needs to be paid for and you have nothing because you provided for nothing.
[time=2957] There's a real balance, you know, in our Christian life between the real commands of Scripture to save and to be prudent and to be wise and to anticipate, even as we saw, to provide for your own household.
[time=2968] And at the same time, to look past some of those things and to be involved in with your money to be giving and actually becoming rich in these good works.
[time=2978] And I'm delighted there are no percentages here, there is no amount here, this is an issue which will be decided between you and your God.
[time=2987] This is a privately determined thing but it cautions us, doesn't it then? To maintain a pure heart, to be constantly exposing our heart to the things of God and to be holding it back from the things of the world and the mentality of the world so that we can have a heart that with God will make the kinds of choices that really honor and please Him.
[time=3008] There's a lot of responsibility in these three verses because He refuses to tie it down to a particular amount or percentage.
[time=3017] But I'll suggest this, I don't really believe that riches belong in a bank account so that they can endlessly compound interest if the heart attitude is such that even though everyone else in this world is miserable, I won't be.
[time=3033] I don't believe that's the intent of money. If you're saving and you're putting money aside as the word of God encourages, in fact, a pastor that I had even before I was saved, it was a good evangelical church, I just was sitting there as an unregenerant.
[time=3045] But He said you should do three things with money, you should make as much as you can, you should save as much as you can and you should give as much as you can, which I think is a great way of saying you'll never figure out how to do all of it.
[time=3057] Just do as much as you can in everyone, try to seek a balance, be confused as you are and pursue God's glory with your money.
[time=3065] Make as much as you can, save as much as you can, and give as much as you can. It's an individual manner.
[time=3072] But if you'll do any research at all about stockpiling money for retirement and then even beyond that into giving massive amounts of wealth to the next generation, you'll read incident after incident after incident
[time=3085] where the great inheritance has only corrupted the youth that follow. Because they have even less judgment to know what to do with the money than you who earned it.
[time=3093] So 2 Corinthians 8, 9, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, that through His poverty you might become rich."
[time=3107] Jesus Christ was rich. Jesus Christ became poor in taking on the form of human flesh and divesting Himself of the divine attributes, then became poor as He lived as public opinion turned against Him as He was faithful to the commission given to Him by His Father and then finally hit the depths of every kind of poverty imaginable when He became sin for you.
[time=3130] So there is in His example, there is in His way, there is in His demeanor, there is in His life and His actions a standard to be sought after that we would see ourselves poor that another might become rich.
[time=3144] How you balance that? Again, it's a private matter for you and the Lord.
[time=3150] I like the very end of this verse 19, look at it, it says, "So that they may take hold of that which is life indeed."
[time=3160] Anytime you talk about money and you talk about life, you talk about the good life, right?
[time=3165] I mean, if you had enough money you'd have the good life, whatever that is.
[time=3169] And what this passage leads you to is not necessarily an enjoyment of the good life, but it allows you to take hold of what is really life, the true life, life indeed.
[time=3179] And what He is saying is when you see your money as a resource in the hands of God to use it for noble things and you begin to do that in a sacrificial way
[time=3189] and you view yourself as storing up the ultimate treasure that you'll enjoy to be in heaven and you live that way now, you have taken a hold of life eternal in the present.
[time=3197] You have taken a hold of that which is life indeed.
[time=3204] So, the rich. Notice then in verse 20, in this just by way of maybe drawing our little book to a close here.
[time=3210] "Oh, Timothy," he says, "guard what has been entrusted to you.
[time=3215] Avoid worldly and empty chatter and opposing arguments of what is falsely called knowledge which some have professed and thus gone astray from the faith.
[time=3225] Grace be with you." He says, "Timothy, guard.
[time=3229] Guard your life.
[time=3230] Guard your truth.
[time=3231] Guard your heart.
[time=3233] Guard the essential essence of what it really means to be a believer as we have laid it out in these last six chapters.
[time=3240] Guard it.
[time=3241] Protect it.
[time=3242] Take responsibility to take this stewardship of truth, a stewardship of ministry, a stewardship of money and protect it for the cause of Christ."
[time=3254] As we close this morning, let me share a little story that the late Peter Marshall, an eloquent speaker, and for several years the chaplain of the United States Senate loved to tell about the keeper of the spring.
[time=3268] The keeper of the spring, a quiet forest dweller who lived high above an Austrian village along the eastern slopes of the Alps.
[time=3277] The old gentleman had been hired many years ago by a town council to clear away the debris from the pools of water up in the mountain crevices that fed the lovely spring flowing through their town.
[time=3288] With faithful, silent regularity, he patrolled the hills, removing the leaves and the branches and wiped away the silt that would otherwise choke and contaminate the fresh flow of water.
[time=3299] By and by, the village became a popular attraction for vacationers. Graceful swans floated along the crystal clear spring, the mill wheels of various businesses located near the water turned day and night.
[time=3311] Farmlands were naturally irrigated, and the view from the restaurants was picturesque beyond description.
[time=3318] Years passed. One evening the town council met for its semi-annual meeting. As they reviewed the budget, one man's eye caught the salary figure being paid the obscure keeper of the spring.
[time=3330] Said the keeper of the purse. Who is this old man? Why do we keep him on here after year? No one ever sees him.
[time=3338] For all we know, the strange ranger of the hills is doing us no good. He isn't necessary any longer.
[time=3344] By a unanimous vote, they dispensed with the old man's services. For several weeks, nothing changed.
[time=3352] By early autumn, the trees began to shed their leaves. Small branches snapped off and fell into the pools, hindering the rushing flow of sparkling water.
[time=3361] One afternoon, someone noticed a slight yellowish brown tint in the spring. A couple days later, the water was much darker.
[time=3369] Within another week, a slimy film covered sections of the water along the banks and a foul odor was detected.
[time=3377] The mill wheels moved slower. Some finally ground to a halt. Swans left as did the tourists, and clammy fingers of disease and sickness reached deep into the village.
[time=3389] Quickly the embarrassed council called a special meeting. Realizing their gross air and judgment, they hired back the old keeper of the spring.
[time=3397] Within a few weeks, the veritable river of life began to clear up. The wheels started to turn and new life returned to the Hamlet and the Alps.
[time=3407] Once again.
[time=3409] I was excited to present the Bible Hour to you today because of the music ministry of Donna and Dan Oxley.
[time=3419] I hope you enjoyed them as much as I did and were really inspired by their musical ministry.
