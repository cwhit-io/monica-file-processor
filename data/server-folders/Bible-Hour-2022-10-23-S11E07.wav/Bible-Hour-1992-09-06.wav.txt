[time=0] See, as Lewis in his book, The Screwtape Letters said it this way, there are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about devils.
[time=10] One is to disbelieve in their existence.
[time=13] The other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=37] Thank you for joining us.
[time=40] This week, Pastor Moore begins a series of messages on Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare.
[time=45] Today, he will address the topic of Satan, who is he and what is his agenda?
[time=51] We encourage you to locate your Bible.
[time=53] Today's message will use selected passages from several portions of the Bible.
[time=59] Our special music today will feature our own sanctuary choir and Joni King.
[time=67] Let's now join our service.
[time=97] [MUSIC - 184 seconds]
[time=299] Well, thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=302] I'm excited about the many events that are taking place in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church this fall.
[time=307] Russell, it's good to see the choir back in there, and Sunday the 13th is just going to be an exciting Sunday for us.
[time=313] Well, we're excited about Friend Day, and if you're watching us this morning, that's today.
[time=317] And you could actually jump in your car and come on over and visit us this morning.
[time=321] We have a continental breakfast on a tent outside on the lawn there, weather permitting from 9 to 9.45,
[time=328] and then we'll have just one service today at 10, and Peter's got a whole host of music lined up.
[time=333] We're going to be talking a little bit about the family.
[time=335] We're going to have some testimonies from some families in our church that have been impacted favorably for the cause of Christ.
[time=342] And so we'd love for you to come join us on a special day such as this one.
[time=347] Stephen Marie will be our musical guest.
[time=349] Many of you are familiar with them since they made their home in Fort Wayne for a number of years.
[time=355] Great Sunday, September 13th, 10 o'clock, one service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=361] Well, I was gone for the weekend and for a few days, and I came back and checked the tickets for the Ray Bolts concert.
[time=369] On September 18th, that concert will be at 8 o'clock Friday evening.
[time=374] There are still some tickets left, but we're going to have a great time here Friday evening, September 18th.
[time=380] Tickets are available at all of our local bookstores in Fort Wayne, or you can call the Black Hawk Baptist Church here at 493,
[time=387] 7400, or stop by tickets are $5. I hope you'll join with us.
[time=393] And then another special event that's coming up on a Sunday evening, October 4th.
[time=398] We're going to have the miracles from Mississippi.
[time=401] These are young men and women who are mildly to a fairly severely mentally handicap,
[time=407] but when they begin to sing and play instruments, they do a miraculous job, and I think that's exactly why they're called the miracles.
[time=414] I hope that you'll set that Sunday evening aside, that Sunday evening, October 4th at 6 p.m.
[time=421] here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=423] What a great night of music you'll experience from the miracles, October 4th at 6 p.m.
[time=430] And then I want to tell you about an exciting project.
[time=432] Russell, we've just begun to record 10 of our soloists that sing regularly on the Bible hour,
[time=438] and we're going to make that cassette available to our people that are watching.
[time=442] Well, that's an exciting project. I think you're going to want to get ahold of one of these cassettes.
[time=447] The music that we enjoy here, the Lord has really brought us some very gifted people.
[time=451] Well, you know, as you watch regularly, you listen to those that God has given to the church here to sing and to express their love and aeration for God through music.
[time=460] I'm excited and looking forward to my copy.
[time=463] You can be sure that it'll be exciting to record our soloists on tape, and we're going to show you from week to week the process here in the studio, and I hope that you'll just remind yourself to plan to receive the tape, and we'll be telling you from week to week just exactly when that tape will be available of our soloists here from the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=485] While we're going back to the live portion of our service in just a moment, and I want to remind you that we're thankful that the choir will be singing regularly.
[time=492] We'll have soloists, and our pastor will be in a new series of messages, and we want to encourage you to continue to faithfully watch the Bible hour and pray for our ministry here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=505] We're so encouraged by those of you that write in and tell us that you watch the Bible hour.
[time=511] We go back now to the live portion.
[time=513] I hope that you'll stay with us.
[time=522] [MUSIC] If I had seen the sunset [MUSIC] On the day that Jesus died [MUSIC] Or felt the glow of the sunrise [MUSIC] When the tomb was opened wide [MUSIC] Would I have known [MUSIC] Could I have seen [MUSIC] That you were more than just a man [MUSIC] You were Lord and King [MUSIC] But now, now I know you [MUSIC] And I can see [MUSIC] That you are Lord of all [MUSIC] You are Lord to me [MUSIC] Jesus Jesus [MUSIC] Lord to me [MUSIC] Master sin [MUSIC] Jesus Jesus [MUSIC] Christ [MUSIC] Christ [MUSIC] Jesus [MUSIC] To me [MUSIC] Jesus Jesus [MUSIC] Christ [MUSIC] O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave [MUSIC] As one to me [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, Lord to be [MUSIC] Master, save your grace of peace [MUSIC] O'er the land of my heart today [MUSIC] Jesus, Lord to be [MUSIC] Amen, Johnny, Jesus, Jesus, Master of my soul, Lord of all. â™ª
[time=795] That's a beautiful song, especially in light of the topic that we will take up this morning.
[time=800] We're going to talk about Satan, and everything that Jesus is and everything that Jesus stands for and everything that Jesus has done stands in stark, bold contrast to his adversary, Satan.
[time=813] We finished the book of 1 Timothy, and before we begin another book, and I'm not even sure which book we'll move to
[time=820] in the morning services, I'm thinking about revelation for the evening services, but I'm not quite sure where the Lord will take us in the morning services.
[time=828] I thought I might take this time in between to talk about Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare.
[time=836] Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare, and just by the way of introducing the series, there are a lot of questions today.
[time=843] In this arena of thought, there are questions about territorial demons, and do demons take control of a house, a town, a city, a country, a region of the world?
[time=856] Is it theirs? Do they dominate it in some possessive way? Are they assigned to that area?
[time=862] There are questions about generational sins, or generational demon possession, and can a demon be passed from one generation of the next through that same genetic line,
[time=873] as if passing genes, passing demons, and holding a family in bondage to the kinds of sins that those particular demons bring?
[time=881] What is a prayer of authority? What are power encounters? What does it mean to bind Satan? Is that biblical?
[time=888] Should I learn how to bind Satan? Should I talk to Satan? Is that something I should be called upon to do as a believer in my walk with Christ?
[time=898] What does it mean to invade Satan's territory? Is that something I should be concerned with?
[time=903] Can Christians be demon-possessed? Can a believer born again and dwelt by the Spirit of God also be indwelt and possessed by a demon?
[time=912] And I guess my main concern here is to answer these questions in light of what the Bible says, and the Bible would give answers and definitive responses to these questions.
[time=923] I am afraid that much of our theology today in contemporary Christianity is built upon experience and clinical experimentation, out of which comes some sort of dogmatism that's being presented as true, or our understanding of Satan and demons and spiritual warfare is being affected by fiction,
[time=941] books that are written about demonic warfare, and though they may be helpful, oftentimes we'll have little or no contact with Scripture.
[time=948] And so our minds are open to think things and to wonder things about Satan and about demons, which may not at all be biblical or true.
[time=956] C.S. Lewis cautions us in such a study, in his Screwtape letters, he said this, "There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about devils.
[time=967] One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them."
[time=976] So we will be guarded and cautioned by this wise man's understanding of one not to totally disbelieve in them, but not to become excessive or have an unhealthy interest in them.
[time=987] And my attempts in this series will in no way be to glamorize Satan to make him into something that he isn't, to push it out on the outer ends of sensationalism, to have some lowing type of series of messages about the dark side of reality.
[time=1003] Instead, I will attempt to do what Paul said in 2 Corinthians 2.11.
[time=1008] He said, "In order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes."
[time=1014] And Paul, speaking to the people at Corinth, they had disciplined someone out of their assembly, and they had refused then to take him back, even though he was repentant.
[time=1024] And they were holding him as a Gentile and as a tax-gatherer, even though the man had stopped his sin and sought the forgiveness of God.
[time=1031] And Paul in that context said to them that, "Don't allow Satan to take advantage of you by not being ignorant of his schemes."
[time=1040] The word advantage he uses there is, "Don't let Satan outwit you. Don't let Satan trick you. Don't let Satan defraud you.
[time=1047] Don't let Satan take you in through trickery and lead you into places you shouldn't go by his schemes, by being ignorant of his schemes."
[time=1055] And the word schemes defines a thought process. It defines purpose. It defines design.
[time=1062] And when coupled in this demonic evil being, it would be his devices, his plots, and his schemes to take advantage of believers because they don't understand his plan of attack.
[time=1073] So, in essence, we will unmask him in this series. We will reveal who he is, how he works, what he tries to do.
[time=1081] And in many ways, it will be much like preparing for a football game.
[time=1084] As we hear the football season cranking up again, we're hearing a lot about scouting reports, a lot about game plans based upon information of the opposing team.
[time=1094] We know they do this, we know they do this, we know they have this threat, we know they have that, and so we have built our defense, our offense, our entire game plan
[time=1101] around what we know they are likely to do. And that is what this is all about.
[time=1106] It was George Patton out on the sands of North Africa, excuse me, North Africa, who successfully launching a counter-attack against his arch enemy, Ramal,
[time=1116] in the deserts of North Africa, who when he saw that his counter-attack was successful, is said to have uttered, "Ramal, I read your book."
[time=1124] And apparently he had done that, Ramal's book was entitled "Infantry Attacks."
[time=1130] And George Patton had not only read it, but studied it and knew it and was able to anticipate the moves of his enemy and gain the victory.
[time=1138] So, we are cautioned by Paul not to be taken advantage of by Satan by being ignorant of his schemes.
[time=1145] So, as we begin this morning, I want to do basically two things. I want to answer the question, who is he?
[time=1151] Who is Satan? And then secondly, I want to answer the question, what is his agenda?
[time=1157] How does he operate? What does he do?
[time=1160] Question number one, who is he? And Satan, I'm sure, would rather this message not be preached.
[time=1166] He would rather remain in the bizarre, a figment of the imagination as he is held by many in America today.
[time=1174] Our culture has successfully debunked him into being some type of ethereal, almost non-existent, bizarre symbol of evil.
[time=1184] He is either that, or he is relegated to a Halloween character in a satin suit with horns on his head and a pitchfork and a fork and tail that we kind of scare our children with.
[time=1195] Or better yet to be reduced to some source in an almost humorous way of evil, as Flip Wilson has noted to have said, the devil made me do it.
[time=1205] But there is clearly a definable character called Satan.
[time=1210] And if we are to understand him and our role in spiritual warfare, we must understand who he really is.
[time=1216] So let's go to where the Bible introduces us to him to the first time, not Genesis chapter 3, but Ezekiel. Ezekiel chapter 28.
[time=1226] This would be Satan before he fell into sin.
[time=1231] This is Satan in his perfected, created glory by God. Ezekiel chapter 28.
[time=1240] Now what you have in Ezekiel chapter 28 is a lamentation or a series of judgments that is being brought against a human being, the king of Tyre.
[time=1252] You'll see him introduced to you in chapter 2, or excuse me, verse 2 of chapter 28, son of man say to the leader of Tyre.
[time=1260] And this leader of Tyre was an evil, ruthless, uncompassionate man.
[time=1266] And as such, he incurs this scathing denunciation in verses 1 through 10 that Ezekiel brings upon the human leader of Tyre.
[time=1277] But in verses 11 and following, Ezekiel goes behind the human leader, beyond the human force to the supernatural force that energizes this human leader.
[time=1290] Verse 11, again the word of the Lord came to be saying son of man, take up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, this time not the actual man, but the superhuman force behind it, Satan.
[time=1301] Now you know that it is superhuman because, for a number of reasons, in verse 12, he said you had the seal of perfection, a term never used of a human.
[time=1311] Verse 14, you were the anointed cherub who covers, a cherub is an angel, not a human, and Satan, as we will see, was first cherub and angel.
[time=1324] He says also, verse 15, you were blameless in your ways, something not used to describe a human being.
[time=1332] Verse 16, in the middle of the verse, from the mountain of God, this being inhabited the very mountain of God.
[time=1340] So we have in focus here the supernatural demon, actually Satan, who was behind the physical natural human leader of Tyre.
[time=1351] Let's pick it up at verse 12, you had the seal of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.
[time=1358] You were in Eden, the garden of God, every precious stone was your covering, the ruby, the topaz, the diamond, the burl, the onks, and the jasper, the lapis, lazuli, the turquoise, and the emerald,
[time=1371] and the gold, the workmanship of your sockets and your settings was in you on the day that you were created.
[time=1377] Verse 14, you were the anointed cherub who covers, and I placed you there.
[time=1383] You were on the holy mountain of God, you walked in the midst of the stones of fire.
[time=1388] You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created. Stop right there.
[time=1393] Let me show you several dimensions about Satan as he was created.
[time=1398] First of all, notice his nature. Satan was an angel. He is several times in this passage called a cherub.
[time=1405] A cherub now, a cherub is one of the ranks of angels. And we begin by noting that all the angels were created by Jesus Christ, Colossians 1, 16.
[time=1415] For by him all things were created, both in heaven and on earth, both visible and invisible.
[time=1422] Whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things have been created by him and for him.
[time=1428] So Satan is a created being created by Jesus Christ.
[time=1433] He was created as a cherub, as one of the invisible, as an angel in heaven.
[time=1440] Now the angels, we don't know exactly when they were created, but we know from Job 38.4 that they were singing at creation itself.
[time=1449] At creation, meaning Genesis chapter 1 and 2. Job is there questioning the integrity of God.
[time=1456] And so Job is responded to by God with the question, "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?"
[time=1463] Then it goes on to say, "When the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy."
[time=1469] The morning song, the morning stars rather, is a reference to angels.
[time=1475] And we won't take time this morning to track it through the Bible, but oftentimes the morning star, the sons of God are terms analogous to an angel.
[time=1485] So they were around before Genesis 1. How much before Genesis 1? We don't know.
[time=1490] How much before God created the heavens and the earth? We don't know, but they were in existence prior to that because they were there when he did it.
[time=1496] So Satan is a created being by Christ as an angel, and that happens sometime before the creation of the world.
[time=1505] Notice secondly his position. In verse 14 he is noted to be an anointed cherub who covers, an anointed cherub who covers.
[time=1514] Now a cherub is noted in Scripture as we ferret out all the evidence as being the highest rank of all the angels.
[time=1522] If you were created a cherub as opposed to a seraphum, you were created in the highest rank of angels.
[time=1528] The cherub is the one who in Genesis 3 is sent by God to guard the tree of life after Adam and Eve are kicked out of the Garden of Eden.
[time=1536] The cherub are the ones who guard the mercy seat in the holy of holies.
[time=1542] They are the ones who are inside the holy of holies and have the privilege placed of guarding the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant.
[time=1550] In Hebrews chapter 9 verse 5 it says the cherubum of glory.
[time=1555] Now what this points out to us is that the ministry of these particular angels, these angels called cherub, was to protect and to proclaim the holiness and the righteousness and the glory of God.
[time=1568] It's interesting they are never once called angels under us or messenger.
[time=1573] The cherub is never directly called an angel because his function was never to go give a message.
[time=1578] His function was instead to protect and to proclaim the sovereignty, the holiness, the very presence of the Shekinah glory of God.
[time=1586] They were given a very unique ministry and it tied itself to the presence and the glory of God.
[time=1591] Now you'll notice again in verse 14 that Satan is called an anointed cherub.
[time=1596] He apparently was even among this highest class of angels given special place and special privilege.
[time=1602] Which makes sense even after the fall he becomes the prince of the devils, the prince of the demonic world, apparently maintaining some of the integrity that was his before the fall.
[time=1614] Next look at his perfection, his perfection in verse 12.
[time=1618] It says there you had the seal of perfection.
[time=1622] Verse 15 you were blameless in your ways. People often ask how in the world did God create this demonic sinful thing full of hate and destruction and deceit?
[time=1633] Well he didn't. God created a cherub. God created an angel. He named him Lucifer son of the morning son of the dawn.
[time=1641] He was perfect. He was blameless in all his ways.
[time=1645] Verse 4, excuse me the fourth thing I want you to see is his habitation that found in verse 13.
[time=1653] Notice it says there you were in Eden the garden of God and here probably not a reference to the garden of Eden on planet earth but the paradise of God in heaven.
[time=1663] Down in verse 14 you were on the holy mountain of God. You walked in the midst of the stones of fire.
[time=1670] This in keeping with a cherub would have described the very paradise of being in the immediate presence and the glory of God.
[time=1679] So by nature he is an angel, a created being by Christ before the foundation of the world.
[time=1685] Position among the highest rank of angels as a cherub and probably the highest in rank of all of those.
[time=1692] He was made an absolute perfection in all this descriptive terminology in verse 13 of the various stones.
[time=1699] That is God's attempt to communicate with our limited minds the splendor and the majesty and the glory of the being that he created Satan to be or Lucifer to be.
[time=1711] I mean he was an expressible to be in his presence would have been overwhelming because of the fluorescent beauty that would have emitted from his very being.
[time=1722] Awesome to behold and granted immediate presence of God until the end of verse 15. Look at it there.
[time=1733] Until unrighteousness was found in you. Somehow he sinned.
[time=1741] Something within him turned his heart against God and he was had gone from being perfect and blameless to being full of unrighteousness.
[time=1752] Furthermore in verse 16 he was reluctant to hold that unrighteousness to himself by the abundance of your trade.
[time=1761] You were internally filled with violence. The word trade there means to merchandise.
[time=1766] He took his unrighteousness and he packaged it as someone who owns a store does and he tried to sell it to anybody who would buy.
[time=1773] And we'll find later in our study of the demons that over a third of the angelic host bought into his unrighteousness and fell with him from glory.
[time=1781] He then sold it to the human race through Adam and Eve in Genesis chapter 3 and he's been selling it to people ever since.
[time=1788] He is evil. He is unrighteous and it is his trade. It is his business.
[time=1793] It is the way he makes a living if you will to sell his unrighteousness to other people.
[time=1799] You'll find that again in verse 18 by the multitude of your iniquities and the unrighteousness of your trade.
[time=1805] That is what he does. That is his business.
[time=1809] So he is cast down. Look again at verse 16.
[time=1812] By the abundance of your trade you were internally filled with violence and you sinned.
[time=1818] Therefore I have cast you as profane from the mountain of God and I have destroyed you O covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire.
[time=1829] Look at verse 17. Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty.
[time=1833] You corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor. I cast you to the ground.
[time=1839] I put you before kings that they may see you.
[time=1844] Say what was it in his heart? What was this wickedness? He became overwhelmed with his own beauty.
[time=1850] He became overwhelmed with his own splendor.
[time=1853] He was so marvelously created by God that he allowed that splendor to if you will go to his head and he turned upon God and rebellion.
[time=1862] We have a picture of that now in Isaiah chapter 14. We can leave Ezekiel 28 and come to Isaiah.
[time=1869] Isaiah chapter 14 and you'll see even more explicitly the manner in which he turned his heart against God because of his own splendor.
[time=1880] Isaiah chapter 14 verse 12.
[time=1886] Again a human ruler is in the forefront but the Satan himself stands in the background.
[time=1894] Verse 12. How have you fallen from heaven, O star of the morning, son of the dawn?
[time=1903] You have been cut down to the earth. You have weakened the nations. Now verse 13.
[time=1910] But you said in your heart, then five times he says two deadly words.
[time=1916] I will over and over again. I will. I will. I will. I will. I will. I will. What does each of the mean? First of all I will ascend to heaven.
[time=1925] The word ascend means to rise up and occupy. I will rise up and occupy the very place in which God resides.
[time=1934] I will have heaven for myself. Heaven will be my place of abode.
[time=1939] Secondly then he says I will raise my throne above the stars of the heaven. What does that mean?
[time=1944] The stars of the heaven is again an illusion to angels themselves, oftentimes called stars of the heaven.
[time=1950] And what he is saying is I will raise my place of authority over all the stars of God, over all the angelic hosts.
[time=1958] They will take their orders from me. I will be their sovereign. I will direct them.
[time=1964] And it is likely that in his exalted position before the fall he was already giving orders to other angels.
[time=1972] It is likely that angels would assemble in his presence as he was in the presence of God and may have been the spokesman of God.
[time=1979] He as a servant of the most high God in such an exalted position may have already done some of that.
[time=1985] But what he is saying is they will do it now because I say so. They will do it now because it will be my command, my order that originated in me and my mind.
[time=1993] Thirdly he said then I will sit on the mount of the assembly in the recesses of the north.
[time=1999] And if you trace that phrase mount of the assembly through the scriptures you'll find it to be a reference to the very place upon which Christ will sit when he reigns in the Millennial Kingdom.
[time=2008] He is saying I will have all the nations of the earth for myself. The peoples of the world will follow me and me alone.
[time=2015] Fourthly he said then I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. They're at the beginning of verse 14. The heights of the clouds, the clouds are often used to describe the glory of God, the very shekin of glory of God.
[time=2029] And what he is saying is I will raise myself in glory above God himself. I will have more splendor than the one who created me.
[time=2037] I will have it all. And then he sums it up with his fifth I will in verse 14 by saying I will make myself like the most high God. I will be independent. I will be autonomous.
[time=2054] So this marvelous created being, the highest in rank among the angels, maybe even the highest among that very rank.
[time=2063] With no previous example of sin, with no one leading the way, with no one to influence him for evil, finds in his own splendor do cause and resource to revolt and shake his fist in the very throne room of God and says though you created me as this awesome and wonderful being I will now have your place.
[time=2082] I will now take over. I will now dethrone you. And God cast him out of heaven. Luke 10, Jesus makes an allusion to watching Satan fall from heaven like lightning.
[time=2094] And he falls to be the prince of the devils, Matthew 9, the prince of the world, John 12, the prince of the power of the air, Ephesians 2, and the God of this world. 2 Corinthians 4.
[time=2111] Let me further define him for you, lest he remain as some ethereal thing without proper definition. Let me give you the seven traits of personality that he has.
[time=2124] He is a person. He has personhood. Here they are. Number one, he has intellect. We've already looked at that verse. 2 Corinthians 11 talks or two rather talks about his scheming, his ability to devise a plot. He can think, he can plan. He is oftentimes confused as we'll see, but he has intellect. Secondly, he has emotions.
[time=2147] That also a defining property of personhood or personality. Isaiah 14, you hear the passion. You hear the emotion of one who would ascribe to be God. Thirdly, he has will. He can make choices.
[time=2162] In Matthew chapter 4, he has led Christ out into the wilderness to tempt him there. And the last temptation he brings to Christ is the offer of all the kingdoms of the world, which apparently were his to give, heaven been given them by God as the monarch of this age.
[time=2175] He says, if you'll mount down and worship you, I will give you the kingdoms of the earth. So he has will. Fourthly, he communicates. He communicates. He communicated with Jesus in Matthew 4. He communicated with Adam and Eve, or at least Eve in the Garden of Eden. And he communicated with God in Job chapter 1. You can read the very conversation that is there.
[time=2199] Fifth, he is described with personal pronouns in the Bible. That being a he or a you as opposed to an it. Sixth, he is given personal nouns or personal names in the Bible. Over 40 different names given to him because he is a person.
[time=2217] And then seventh, he is held personally accountable by God and God only holds people or beings, personalities, accountable. And as you know, he will be judged ultimately and forever by being thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2233] So he is more than some ethereal thing out there in the never lens of spiritual darkness. He is a being. He is a person, intellect, emotion, will, communication, personal pronouns, proper names, and personal accountability.
[time=2252] He is a spirit. He does not have a body. He may materialize with a body from time to time, but he is not in essence of physical form. He is not a human. He is a spirit. He is an immaterial being.
[time=2268] And let me further define by saying what he is not. Having said what he is, let me give you a few things that define him further by saying what he is not. First of all, he is not omnipresent. He is not everywhere at once. Right now, he is somewhere. I have no idea where. It could be in this room. I seriously doubt it.
[time=2286] But if he were here, he would be here and not somewhere else. He may be in Russia. He may be in Africa. He may be assaulting or leading some demonic crusade. But if that's where he is, that's where he is.
[time=2299] They can move very fast. As we will see in our study of demons, they can get from here to there in the twinkling of an eye, but it requires movement because as angels, still yet a fallen angel, he is limited by spatial reality.
[time=2314] Secondly, he is not omnipotent. He is not omnipotent. He is not all powerful. He is powerful, very powerful, but he does not have all power. Thirdly, he is not omniscient. He doesn't know everything.
[time=2332] He doesn't know everything you're thinking. He doesn't know the beginning from the end. He doesn't know all the details of everything that will happen from here until the end.
[time=2341] You can notice that about angels in 1 Peter chapter 1. It says there that the angels long to look into the things of God. Why? Because they don't know them.
[time=2351] You can see the inability of Satan to know the beginning from the end in his somewhat futile attempt to keep Christ from the cross.
[time=2360] When Christ was yet a babe, he tried to have him wiped out. In Matthew 4, he tried to keep him from the cross by offering him the kingdoms of the world.
[time=2367] He tried to keep Christ from the cross through Peter who said that you will not die, Lord. And the Lord looked at him and said, "Get thee behind me Satan," an attempt of Satan to keep Christ from the cross.
[time=2379] But when all had been said and done and everything was inevitably there, he rushed into the heart of Judas and really escalated the whole process, brought it through ahead and drove Christ to the cross.
[time=2390] So there's great confusion within the kingdom of darkness, and there is obviously not an omniscient mind who would drive Judas to bring Christ to the cross his own ultimate defeat.
[time=2402] So he is not omnipresent, omnipotent, omniscient. Fourthly, he is not self-existent. As a created creature, he is utterly dependent upon God for his very existence every moment of the day.
[time=2415] In the same way that of God would remove from us the power of life we would die and expire so it is of Satan.
[time=2422] And fifthly, he is not sovereign. He is the monarch of this world system. He is the king of this world system, but he reports to another, namely God, and he can only function within the parameters that God allows, Job chapter 1 and following.
[time=2437] He can only touch Job to the degree that God allowed him to. So that is his state.
[time=2443] Satan then, a created being, a cherub, a marvelously gifted and beautified being by God at creation fell because he was overcome by his own splendor, the five eye wills of Isaiah 14 cast down to be the prince of this world system.
[time=2463] That is who he is. Now, what is his agenda? What is his agenda? Secondly, what is he trying to do?
[time=2471] Well, first of all, I am happy to report he has already failed. He will not be ultimately successful in his agenda.
[time=2478] It has already been crushed at the cross. He resembles more a basketball team with 30 seconds left on the clock that is trailing by 15 points and has absolutely no hope of winning, though they continue to try their best.
[time=2491] The outcome of the war is already totally concluded and decisive at the cross.
[time=2498] However, there are many battles to be fought and he will win some battles. He may win some battles in your life. He would love to be victorious in your life to lead you into the defeat of sin.
[time=2509] The best way maybe to describe how he works in his agenda is to describe his names. To understand something of his names, he has over 40 titles or names and the Bible will sample a few of them this morning.
[time=2522] The first, Satan. He is called Satan 52 times in the Bible. It means adversary or apposer. The word Satan means adversary.
[time=2532] And he first and foremost is in an adversarial position against God. God is the one he hates. God is the one he wants to usurp.
[time=2541] God is the one he fights against. You and I as believers and even the holy angels are incidental to that battle.
[time=2549] We only become important to it because we are means to a greater end for Satan. He can attack God through the angels. He can attack God through us.
[time=2558] And so therein is our importance to Satan. Beyond that, we're nothing to him. God is the one he hates. God is the one he is after.
[time=2567] Secondly, he is called a devil or the devil 35 times in the Bible. The Abolas means to slander. It means to trip up through slander.
[time=2579] When you combine the words inside of the Abolas, slander and trip up, it means he wants to trip up the people of the world.
[time=2586] He wants to trip up the kingdom program of God by slandering the very name of God.
[time=2591] Have you ever wondered why it's always the Lord's name that is taken in vain? Why it's never Buddha damn you?
[time=2598] Or O sung young moon instead of O the name of our blessed Lord? Why is it that is always God's name that is cussed?
[time=2606] Why is it that is always Christ's name that is taken in vain?
[time=2610] There is never any other way to cuss ultimately than that way. That's because it is the devil.
[time=2616] It is the slanderer who works in the hearts of the unregenerate who slanders the name of God through that type of cussing.
[time=2625] Just an obvious open display of his work in the world.
[time=2629] So Satan and the devil, then a couple of words that seem to be taken from the animal kingdom or the animal genre.
[time=2636] He is called the serpent in Revelation 12, 9 to describe his cunning deception.
[time=2642] He is called the great red dragon in Revelation 12, 3 to describe his destructive power, his consuming destructive power.
[time=2652] He is called a roaring lion in 1 Peter 5, 8 describing his desire to devour, to suck down, drink down whole, the believer in his pursuit of Christ.
[time=2664] And then in his adversarial position against truth, he is called the evil one, John 1715, and in 1 John 3 called a sinner.
[time=2676] These are terms that describe him as characteristically evil, intrinsically evil, inherently evil.
[time=2682] Pune Ross is the word in the Greek and it means intrinsic internal evil, and he is looking to corrupt as many other people in evil as he possibly can.
[time=2693] He is also called the deceiver of Revelation 12 to deceive the whole world, which he will eventually do at the end of the age for a period of time before Christ crushes him and throws him into the lake of fire.
[time=2706] It's interesting to think about his deceiving agenda. Satan is far less concerned that he deceived people through Satanism, or the occult, or through seances and Ouija boards and witches and warlocks,
[time=2722] and all that whole dimension of the underworld. That really is insignificant to him.
[time=2728] The way that he is deceiving people most effectively and in the greatest numbers is through false doctrine. Satan will send thousands to hell through witchcraft.
[time=2740] He will send millions and millions and millions of people to hell through false doctrine.
[time=2747] He is also called a liar, John 844. It says when he speaks, he speaks the lie.
[time=2753] The lie uses a definite article to describe that Satan basically has one lie, and he gave it to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden that you can be like God.
[time=2761] It's the same lie he told himself in Isaiah 14. It's the same lie he tries to tell you and everybody else.
[time=2767] You don't have to be dependent upon God. You don't have to submit to your Creator. You can be independent, autonomous, live anywhere you want to live without any consequence.
[time=2774] That is the lie of Satan. And then it climaxes by calling him a murderer. Also in John 844, he loves to take life.
[time=2783] And he wants to take life in the physical realm in any possible way that he can by addicting people to alcohol or drugs or work,
[time=2791] and through child abuse and lethargy and materialism and obesity and just on and on and on and on and on.
[time=2797] And every possible perversion that he can possibly bring into a person's life to destroy, even as an unregenerate, the earthly quality of their life, he loves it.
[time=2806] He loves it. He delights in it. But ultimately, he seeks spiritual life. He wants to sap people and keep them from it.
[time=2813] 2 Corinthians 4 says that he has blinded the minds of the unbelieving. And through his world system, he sets up vehicles in place that literally blind the people from accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2826] In 1 Thessalonians 2, 18, Paul notes that he is hindered in propagating the gospel by Satan himself, says Satan has hindered me from coming several times.
[time=2839] Satan wants to defeat the gospel message, and he wants to stop people who bring the gospel message from reaching their destination.
[time=2848] So he is the serpent, the great red dragon, the roaring lion, the evil one, the deceiver, the liar, and the murderer.
[time=2862] You say, should I be afraid of him? Answer. No.
[time=2866] Should I be afraid of him? No. 1 John 4, 4. Greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. If you have Christ in your heart, if you are a believer, you have nothing to fear from Satan.
[time=2880] He is to be respected for who he is and his deceitful schemes, but he is not to be feared. It's like the little girl who was once asked by an older person does Satan tempt you to do sin?
[time=2893] And the little girl said, why yes, often? And the inquirer said, well, what do you do when he comes tempting you?
[time=2902] And she says, well, when Satan comes and knocks upon the door of my heart, I just ask Jesus to answer the door.
[time=2909] That's very simple, isn't it? That's very good. That's very true. Satan lives here.
[time=2914] And I ask my Lord, the one that John is saying of, prince of peace to answer the door.
[time=2922] And Satan flees. James 4, 7, resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=2928] And we saw that in the example of Jesus in Matthew chapter 4 as three times Satan attempted to call him or to lead him into sin and every time Jesus resisted him with the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, the Ramah in the Greek, those short little responses from God's word and eventually Satan fled.
[time=2948] He is not to be feared because the one who is in us is greater than the one who is in the world. He is not to be feared because we have the promise of God that if we resist him, he will flee from us.
[time=2957] And he is not to be feared because Revelation 2010 says that he will be thrown into the lake of fire and their torment at day and night forever.
[time=2965] His ultimate end has already been determined.
[time=2968] So respect, yes. Fear him, no. You say, well, how do I respect him? How am I cautioned against who he is and what he does?
[time=2980] And I will give you three, maybe four, critical areas that Satan will work in the life of the believer.
[time=2989] And to see the first one come with me to 1 Samuel chapter 15. 1 Samuel chapter 15.
[time=3000] Saul is in view here. King Saul, the nation of Israel, he had won a great victory at the strength of the Lord against the Amalekites, but he would have been instructed to wipe them all out, not to take any of their herds or the produce, even the people themselves, to wipe them all out, and he had failed to do that.
[time=3029] In verse 22, Samuel talks to him about his disobedience to God. 1 Samuel 15, 22, has the Lord as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the Lord?
[time=3044] Behold, he says, to obey is better than sacrifice and to heed than the fat of rams.
[time=3054] Now verse 23, for rebellion is as the sin of divination.
[time=3060] Rebellion is as the sin of divination and insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry, because you have rejected the word of the Lord. He has also rejected you from being king.
[time=3075] The simple sentence I'm trying to focus on is in verse 23 for rebellion is as the sin of divination. The word divination describes willfully placing yourself under the realm of the power of Satan.
[time=3088] Now as a believer, you've been transferred from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his beloved son, and nothing can reverse that process. You can never be Satan's again.
[time=3097] You can never be in the kingdom of darkness as being possessed by it. You have been brought out of that through the redemptive blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=3104] But when as a believer, you act in rebellion against God. It says there, it is as the sin of divination.
[time=3115] When you do as Satan did, and clench your fist in the face of God and rebel against his word, you play into the deceitful cunning schemes of Satan.
[time=3125] You say, even for a moment that statement of autonomy, I will do what I want to do. I will not submit.
[time=3133] To the young people in the room today, when you fail to submit to your parents, to your teachers, when you have a rebellious heart, you play into the scheme of Satan for your life, and he waits and seeks and stalks like a roaring lion to devour you.
[time=3150] To we who are adults, we say when you refuse to submit to the authority of God in your life, whether from the government, whether from your employment, the leadership of the church and the word of God, when you fail to submit your heart and your life before God, you fall into the schemes of Satan for your life in rebellion.
[time=3173] He has you right where he wants you, and you dishonor the name of God, rebellion, anti-authority.
[time=3182] I believe there's a little bit of that in all of us. If you look very long, you'll see it.
[time=3187] And what we are to do is to recognize it and to repent and to humble ourselves beneath the authority of God.
[time=3194] Secondly, come with me over to Ephesians chapter 2.
[time=3207] Here is maybe one of the best descriptive passages in all the New Testament about Satan and the way he works.
[time=3214] Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 and following says you were dead in your trespasses and sins. This is describing us before we knew Christ.
[time=3223] In which you formally walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[time=3232] That's who we were. We used to walk according to the course of this world, and that was set by the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now working.
[time=3242] Among them too, we all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature, children of wrath, even as the rest.
[time=3255] When we as believers choose to walk in the course of the world, the lusts of our flesh, and that doesn't just mean sexual behavior, that's just the whole craving of self for satisfaction.
[time=3269] When the agenda of our life, when the agenda of our day, when the agenda of that moment is us and our satisfaction and our needs being met, the indulging of the desires of the flesh and of the mind, we re-enter temporarily the schemes of Satan and his design for our lives.
[time=3291] It says there we are at the Universe 3 by nature, children of wrath, even as the rest. And the wrath ultimately describes our end outside of Christ, the wrath of the judgment seat of eternal damnation, but wrath also describing the relationships of wrath.
[time=3308] When a believer harbors anger in their heart, when a believer holds on to anger in their heart, and they are destroying relationships, there we are fulfilling the desires of Satan for the flesh.
[time=3324] The last one we've already looked at in weeks past, it is when we fall into believing false doctrine. When we believe in things that are not true, when we take a hold of the demon doctrines of 1 Timothy, chapter 4 verses 1 and 2, you remember those, and we are in that way inoculated from true Christianity.
[time=3342] Let me give one last quote, William Colbertson says this, "Millions of Christians live in a sentimental haze of vague piety, soft organ music, trembling in the lovely light from stained glass windows.
[time=3354] The religion is a thing of pleasant emotional quivers, divorced from the real, divorced from the intellect, and demanding little except lip service to a few harmless platitudes.
[time=3364] I suspect that Satan has called off the attempt to convert people to agnosticism. If a man travels far enough away from Christianity, he is always in danger of seeing it in perspective and deciding that it is true.
[time=3377] It is much safer from Satan's point of view to vaccinate a man with a mild dose of Christianity so as to protect him from the real thing." There it is.
[time=3388] That is the way in which Satan will send most people to hell. They will find themselves in religious systems, in religious dogmas that are divorced of the truth, be leaving themselves to be on the broad road in Matthew 7 when in fact the broad road leads not to heaven but to hell.
[time=3412] What a privilege it was to hear our choir again with that jubilant song "Lift High the Lord Our Banner" and then the soul from Joni King and the message was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3423] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior and go on living a life that would be pleasing to him, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3434] Dear Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and I can tell you that I'm a sinner and I've never accepted you and acknowledged you.
[time=3441] Acknowledge you as Savior. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and become my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3451] If you prayed that prayer today, write us and tell us the nature of your decision. When you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3464] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the cassette tape of Bible hour soloists, please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3480] To receive a cassette copy of today's message write and request tape number 1568 or mention the message by Pastor Moore entitled "Unmasking Satan" and please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3506] The Bible hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club, a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry. To learn how you can become a member of the Founders Club, please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3526] Now speaking for Pastor Russell Moore and the Bible hour staff, this is Ed Richard and I do you to join us each week at this time for the Bible Hour.
