[time=0] I believe what America needs today, what Fort Wayne needs today, our parents with a unified
[time=8] faith, where they stand together in the belief that in fact God does exist, and this notion
[time=16] of evolution, unsupported as it is, needs to be put aside, and we need to return back
[time=22] to the basic understanding upon which even this country was founded, that God exists,
[time=31] that we each one of us are not the product of time plus chance, that our greatest ancestors are not an amoeba somewhere in a swamp, but instead that the true and living God, by his
[time=42] own choice and design, created us as human beings in his image.
[time=52] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=62] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=64] Thank you for joining us.
[time=68] It seems the family in America today is falling apart, broken homes, physical, emotional and
[time=75] sexual abuse, financial hardship.
[time=79] What can be done?
[time=81] As part of our friend day celebration here at Blackhawk, Pastor Moore will be bringing a special message from God's Word, providing an encouraging word of hope for the family.
[time=94] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the Book of Hebrews.
[time=99] We will be looking at verse 23.
[time=104] Our special music today will feature our own sanctuary choir and orchestra, and our special
[time=111] guests, Steve and Maria Gartner.
[time=117] Let's now join our service.
[time=126] Praise the Lord, it is great to be praised, in the mountain of His Holy Ghost.
[time=203] When I think of His loving kindness, in the midst of His loving people, I will lift my
[time=224] heart to praise Him for His tender mercies to me.
[time=239] Praise the Lord, it is great to be praised, in the mountain of His Holy Ghost.
[time=272] I will lift up my voice, I will sing to your Lord, I will open my eyes, I will dance in
[time=287] Christ, I will sing to your Lord, I will sing to your Lord, I will sing to your Lord,
[time=307] it is great to be praised, in the mountain of His Holy Ghost.
[time=340] Praise the Lord, it is the Lord and the Holy of God, it is the Lord and the Holy of
[time=355] God, it is great to be praised, it is the Lord, it is great to be praised, in the
[time=373] mountain of His Holy Ghost, it is great to be praised, in the mountain of His Holy
[time=384] Ghost.
[time=385] Praise the Lord, it is great to be praised, in the mountain of His Holy Ghost.
[time=430] Amen, what a great God we have, and thank you for singing His praises together with the choir, it is just a great joy to stand right here and hear the music coming from behind me and in front of me and knowing that we are praising our Savior together.
[time=444] What a great day and we welcome you here, we will say more about that in a few minutes, but our great guests are here today and I do mean they are great, we love them.
[time=452] Stephen Marie and Mandy Gardner are here from Colorado but they are still really from Fort Wayne, we are just so glad they are here, would you welcome them and let's look forward to their music today.
[time=464] Oh, thank you, it is so good to be back and to hear this choir, you guys are awesome,
[time=473] wonderful, great to see so many familiar faces, we don't often get that privilege, but man it feels like home.
[time=487] Holy is He, the Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise, we worship Him only, lover of truth,
[time=499] holy is He, holy is He, O let us adore Him, lift up His name, we bow down before Him,
[time=511] righteous and just, high and exalted, holy is He, holy is He.
[time=523] He reigns on high with strength and compassion, Baruch Adolai, faithful companion, spirit and
[time=534] light, light that the last King, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, the
[time=546] Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise, we worship Him only, Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise, we worship Him only, lover of truth, Father of mercy, holy is He, holy is He, holy is
[time=565] He is unchanged, God of our fathers, cry out His name, He faithfully answers, glorious
[time=580] He, wonderful Savior, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy is He, holy
[time=600] Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, the Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise, we worship Him only, love her untrue, father of mercy.
[time=649] Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He.
[time=670] The concept of God's holiness is not talked about that much anymore, and yet we know that
[time=683] that is a primary attribute of God.
[time=687] Somehow without His holiness, all of the other things that we know and appreciate so much,
[time=693] His love and His grace, His compassion, His forgiveness, His willingness to adopt us into
[time=699] His family and make us His very own children.
[time=702] None of those things could happen if God was not first, a holy and righteous God.
[time=709] In the book of Revelation we read, "The words great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God the Almighty, worthy art thou, our Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and
[time=722] power. All the nations of the earth will come and worship before thee, for thou hast created
[time=730] all things. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and
[time=740] who is to come. Holy, holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, and we lift our hearts before
[time=760] you as a token of our love. Holy, holy, holy, gracious Father, gracious Father, we are
[time=784] so blessed to be your children, gracious Father, and we lift our hearts before you as a token
[time=800] of our love. Gracious Father, gracious Father, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
[time=828] and we lift our hearts before you as a token of our love. Hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=844] Holy, holy, holy, holy, all the saints are Dorothy, casting down their golden crowns
[time=870] Around the blessed sea, Jeremy, and Sarah Finn, falling down before thee.
[time=897] Holy, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God the Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is
[time=926] to come. Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
[time=953] holy, holy, holy, holy, holy. We're involved in the ministry of Youth for Christ. I think
[time=961] most of you know that, and as we travel around the country and a lot of places around the world, we see young people who are, in my estimation, more lost in many ways than they've
[time=973] ever been before, particularly in this country, and we see it in our own high school. Every Tuesday night, in our home, the Youth for Christ small group meets, and out of 90-some kids
[time=985] that we have had in our home, they don't, that many come every week, but we may have 30, we may have 40, we may have 20, we've had over 90 over the last couple of years,
[time=997] and out of all of those kids, maybe three, possibly four, one of whom is Mandy, profess
[time=1006] to be believers. The rest of them have no Christian background at all. Their parents don't go to church, they don't go to church, they don't know anything. And it's amazing to us how really pagan in the sense of not claiming any allegiance to any God, in many
[time=1024] cases, not even so sure that there is a God. I don't expect that in our culture, and yet
[time=1031] we're seeing that. And so week after week, we try to love them to the Lord, and as this next song says, we try to convince them that in spite of what they are experiencing in
[time=1043] their lives or have experienced in their lives, Jesus never fails. He is the one who makes
[time=1049] life worth living, the one who puts it all together.
[time=1056] Sometimes this world brings trouble, I find so hard to bear. I know I couldn't make it
[time=1067] without Jesus being there. It's so encouraging to know, however deep we're in despair, that
[time=1079] Jesus never fails. So what can I do to prove to you? Tell me how can you deny? No one told
[time=1095] facts, no mysteries. It's all so kind and dry. On the witness stand of your life, I'll
[time=1104] be the first to testify that Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails.
[time=1129] You might as well get thee behind me, Satan. You cannot prevail, because Jesus never fails.
[time=1145] Jesus never fails. Jesus never fails. You might as well get thee behind me, Satan. You
[time=1163] cannot prevail, because Jesus never fails.
[time=1193] Amen, and thank you again. Well, we're kind of focusing this morning on the family, and
[time=1210] as Steve and Maria have brought our thinking into that realm as they've shared some experiences out of their own lives, we've also asked a couple in our church, a family, to share a
[time=1221] little bit about what the difference Christ has made in their life, and they have been a part of Blackhawk Baptist Church for all about a year. They've lived in Fort Wayne
[time=1232] for about eight years, and so would you welcome to the platform George and Jody Harder.
[time=1244] There's a lot of people out there this morning. First of all, we would like to tell you how
[time=1256] pleased we are to be up here in front of you this morning to share with you what a blessing a Blackhawk Baptist Church has been in our lives. Jody and I both know Jesus Christ is our personal Lord and Savior, and two years ago as we prepare to send Zachary to first grade, we truly believe that the best thing for our family was to send them to Christian schools. As Jody and I, to the best of our knowledge, as we look back into our families,
[time=1282] it's the best of our knowledge. We are the first couple that we can say have dedicated
[time=1288] their lives of Christ, so you can see how important that or why we believe that Christian education was so important to us. That summer before first grade, we were given a personal
[time=1298] gift which enabled us to send Zachary to Blackhawk Christian School. Our prayer at that time
[time=1304] was not only how we are going to keep him and the Christian school, but Lindsay as well
[time=1311] as she started kindergarten this past year this fall. The Lord answered our prayer and
[time=1318] sixty days ago, we moved into a less expensive home. The whole process of knowing that that
[time=1325] was one of the things that we could do and all the circumstances surrounding the selling of our previous home and the buying of the home that we're in now is a true testimony
[time=1336] of what God can do in our lives. The staff at the Christian school and in the Sunday school program is extremely talented and dedicated. They are totally committed to the spiritual
[time=1348] growth of our children. The truth that is taught, the truth that is taught in those classrooms
[time=1357] is being reflected in their lives even today. Lindsay at even five years old as we returned
[time=1363] to a neighborhood for a visit, told Jodi shortly after that visit that about a conversation
[time=1371] that she had had with little girls there. And she said, "Mommy, did you know Katie doesn't
[time=1377] know who God is?" And I asked Katie, I said, "Do you know why we go to church? Do you
[time=1384] know why you go to church?" And Katie said, "No." And she said, "I told her, we go to
[time=1390] church, you go to church to learn about God. And did you know that God made you? He really
[time=1396] did. And He made everything around us. And He made even the food that you eat. And did
[time=1403] you know that if you asked Jesus into your heart, this is my little girl, I'll get choked up here. And did you know that if you asked Jesus into your heart that you could go to heaven and live forever with Jesus, we will. We'll all get to go to heaven and live with
[time=1418] Jesus if we would ask Him into our heart. And Zachary as we lived in that same neighborhood and he shared with two little boys in the neighborhood and witness to them right in our
[time=1428] garage, I believe. And shortly thereafter, right after that, they built an altar in the front flower bed. Well, the place in that flower bed just happened to be where I began to shovel
[time=1439] all the snow for the winter that was to come. And after the snow melted, that altar was made up of sticks and bird feathers, stones, pine needles, I was told this morning before
[time=1452] we came in, brown and green. Well, still standing. And finally, we took it down after the neighbors
[time=1459] started to ask us if we were starting a cemetery for our pets in front. But not only had the
[time=1465] children been blessed in our family, but Jody and I as well, as we review their Bible stories
[time=1471] and the Bible verses that they're learning, God is truly working in our lives through the people here at Black Hawk Baptist Church for which we are very grateful.
[time=1480] There are so many diverse ministry opportunities for us here at Black Hawk because of Black
[time=1486] Hawk size, but also because of its commitment that one person can't possibly be involved in every area, although I do know a few people who come close to that. But if I were to take
[time=1497] the areas that have most touched our lives here at the church and group them under two categories, I would call those categories food and fellowship. Now, when I say food, I'm
[time=1507] not referring to our Sunday school potlucks or that delicious chocolate cake that Jill Norr baked for our entire choir at rehearsal last week, although I must say we do enjoy those as well. But I'm referring to the spiritual food that we receive right here in this very room. Pastor Moore has opened up spiritual truths to us in the Bible that we had not
[time=1529] seen before. We've received wisdom and strength and comfort in times of need of that and we've
[time=1538] received a challenge to be bold in our faith. Sometimes we need that challenge, I believe,
[time=1545] and we've really appreciated his willingness to be bold in his teaching. Sometimes when
[time=1551] he covers topics that he knows will not make him most popular with some people. We've appreciated
[time=1557] that boldness in his teaching and I feel that we need that. Sometimes I feel kind of like
[time=1563] a rechargeable battery. During the week when I'm away from my Christian friends and family,
[time=1570] I kind of start to lose focus. I start to drain a little bit and get consumed with worldly things like decorating our new home, things that really aren't very important. It's very helpful for me to come back here and start to recharge and plug in to what's really important
[time=1586] in my life and to remind myself of whose child I am and what is the most important thing for me and that is serving my Lord and Savior.
[time=1598] While we receive spiritual food here in the sanctuary, but we also get kind of a dessert in our Sunday school classes and in our in-home Bible studies, which has really been a nice supplement to what we've received here and has helped us to both grow spiritually. Several years ago, when our son was an infant, I took a job in a hospital working every weekend.
[time=1619] As an allied health professional, it was very easy to obtain work in the hospital on weekends because there was a great need for it. Well, this kept our son out of daycare, but it kept us out of church. I thought that, well, as long as I stay in the Word and we receive spiritual
[time=1634] food through the television broadcast, Christian broadcast and radio broadcast, we'll be okay.
[time=1642] When we had some favorite pastors that we listened to regularly on TV, we thought things would be okay, but they weren't, and we stopped growing spiritually. What we lacked was Christian fellowship.
[time=1653] I guess I hadn't realized how important it was to be fellowshiping regularly with other Christians and believers. Of course, we have friends outside of the church, too, but we really need the strength that we obtain from our Christian friends and sharing with them on a regular basis. I believe that it was God's desire for us to fellowship and be unified
[time=1675] as one together. Before Jesus was crucified on the cross, he gave a beautiful prayer to
[time=1683] God about his disciples, but also about us who were to come in the future. It's recorded
[time=1689] in John 17, and I'd like to share part of it with you now. My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message. May they be brought
[time=1700] to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you
[time=1707] have loved me. We are very grateful for the unity that God has blessed this Black Hawk family of believers with. A year ago, this room seemed so big to me, and now, through
[time=1718] God's love, it's going smaller and smaller, and we really feel unified and a part of this family, and we have really gained strength from it.
[time=1735] Thank you, Harters. Encouraging words. It's a wonderful morning, isn't it, to focus in on the family. It has been more than an interesting week for the Moore family, speaking of myself
[time=1748] and my four daughters because my wife, Heidi, left for California last Tuesday, five days
[time=1754] ago. So I am now officially Mr. Mom. And I was just so I started the week with the highest
[time=1761] of expectations. So I was thinking about my role and my involvement with the girls and seizing these seven days. She'll come back next Tuesday as a tremendous opportunity to build some memories that I would favor having in our lives. And so as a result of these high expectations, I said no to all the invitations from people in my church that said, would
[time=1780] you all join us for dinner? You know, we'll help your load. And I said no to all the other invitations that said, could we bring dinner in? And I said no to all the other invitations that said, could the girls spend the night at our house? Because I just wanted it to be us. Oh, my lands. If only we could do this week over again. I went to the market and
[time=1802] I laid out my menu and I bought everything I thought I needed. And I loaded it in the thing. And I'll tell you what, if I see another spoon that has to be washed and put
[time=1811] in the washing machine, then taken out of that and put in the spoon drawer and then taken out and put on the table so that it can then be washed again and then put in the, I'm going to go nuts. I have no idea how my wife does this. All the questions and all the homework
[time=1826] and all the things that go into this, I think it all came crystal clear to me about two nights ago. When I was down to sleep in my bedroom and down the hall, I was awakened by the cry of my young daughter, my youngest daughter, two and a half year old Whitney.
[time=1841] So I jumped out of bed, something I'm not known to do when my wife is at home and went down the hall and grabbed little Whitney out of the bed and put her on my shoulder and she was, she was all shook up. I want mommy to come home. And as I looked at the clock
[time=1858] and saw it reading 3 a.m., I said me too. So hey, it's not Mother's Day, but I want
[time=1867] to say to you, Mother's out there. Many of you, homemakers, many of you in the home and
[time=1873] also in the workplace, I have a nuisance of appreciation for you and for all you do.
[time=1879] And we are blessed to have mothers in the world. So congratulations, ladies. I'm convinced
[time=1891] we don't say thank you often enough and in meaningful enough ways. Would you take your
[time=1897] Bible with me just for a moment this morning? We're not going to take a lot of time, maybe 10 or 15 minutes around the Word of God to look at a family, a family that lived some
[time=1908] 4,000 years ago. We've heard from two families this morning and my thanks to both of them
[time=1915] for candidly sharing the difference that Christ has made in their lives. But as you know, the word family is being used in the political arena at great length these days. And what
[time=1928] I'm going to say today really has little to do with that. I want to make no political stance this morning. Instead I want to go to a family that lived 4,000 years ago and instead
[time=1938] of the political or the governmental environment and arena vying for the family and for trying
[time=1945] to define the family, this family we're going to look at today lived under a government
[time=1952] that was trying to kill the family. They wanted to wipe out the family. It was the nation of
[time=1958] Israel, the Hebrews. And they were living in the land of Egypt. They were in a foreign government. They were so journers in a foreign land. And these Israelites, these Hebrews
[time=1971] were multiplying. They were growing in numbers so vastly. They probably had reached about
[time=1977] 2 million people and they had showed up some years before with only 70 people. They were the slave labor of Egypt. But they were growing so fast their number was becoming so large
[time=1988] that the king of Egypt feared their number. And so he made a decree and he said that all
[time=1996] the male Hebrew babies must be put to death at birth. I guess you could call that genocide
[time=2005] the deliberate attempt to wipe out a particular people or a race. Now that is related to us
[time=2012] in the Old Testament in the book of Exodus. And we're not going to go back and read that this morning. We're going to read just one little verse about one of those male Hebrew baby boys and the family that surrounded him. His name is Moses. Hebrews chapter 11 verse
[time=2028] 23. It says in this verse, "By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months
[time=2041] by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of
[time=2047] the king's edict." The king's edict I've explained to you. It was his command that all of the
[time=2053] male Hebrew babies be put to death. So here is a family trying to survive in a nation where
[time=2060] the very government is in opposition to their existence. And what I want to say to you this
[time=2066] morning, which will only reinforce these marvelous testimonies, and I really other than having heard Steve's previously this, I had no idea what was going to be said today, but I want to reinforce from the Word of God that I believe that our need in America today is to have
[time=2083] families that are full of faith in God. So that regardless of the government or the structure
[time=2092] of the government, we can see strong families being raised up. And I want to say that to
[time=2098] you in three ways. I want to say today, first of all, that families in America need a unified
[time=2104] faith, a unified faith. If you look at verse 23 again, you'll notice that it says, "By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by whom?" By his parents.
[time=2116] By his parents. And in the original language, that is written in such a way to show that it was the activity of both of his parents. They were unified in the decision to hide the
[time=2126] young boy. They should have put him to death immediately. And by hiding him, they jeopardized their own lives. They could have lost their lives for that decision. But together, they made the decision unified as mother and father to hide the child. I believe what America
[time=2142] needs today, what Fort Wayne needs today, our parents with a unified faith, where they
[time=2149] stand together in the belief that in fact God does exist. And this notion of evolution,
[time=2157] unsupported as it is, needs to be put aside. And we need to return back to the basic understanding
[time=2163] upon which even this country was founded. That God exists. That we, each one of us, are not
[time=2171] the product of time plus chance. That our greatest ancestors are not an amoeba somewhere
[time=2177] in a swamp. But instead, that the true and living God by his own choice and design created
[time=2183] us as human beings in his image. And that in fact, he not only created us that way, but that he went a step further and he gave us, as Steve mentioned in his testimony, the instruction
[time=2194] manual, the way to operate this thing called a human. I guess most of us have made it into
[time=2201] the computer age. And there is a lot of technology to be pushed through. I did not grow up with
[time=2208] a computer and I got one the other day and I've been working through all of that and I've found a lot of barriers to get through that. But I have found that what I have needed to get through those barriers is the instruction manual by the man who made the computer. And
[time=2222] when I follow the instruction manual, when I understand the instruction manual and I begin to apply that information to the computer, it begins to do marvelous and wonderful things.
[time=2234] If you will, as human beings, we have been created, not by a man of brilliance who put together a computer, but by the God of the universe who then published for our understanding
[time=2246] an instruction manual, the Word of God, not to destroy our lives, not to hurt our lives,
[time=2252] not to make us have some kind of miserable existence, but instead, so it could be read,
[time=2258] understood, applied to the situations in life and allow us to experience all that God would
[time=2264] have intended for us from the beginning. I think about the unified faith of my parents,
[time=2271] Bob and Sue Moore, who I was born in California. And I remember that hearing now, I wasn't
[time=2278] obviously there, but when my parents were 21 years of age, they made a decision to accept Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior. And they began the process of studying the instruction manual. And they began not only to apply that to their own lives, but they
[time=2296] began to apply it to my life. And I remember, as a young boy on a basketball team, where
[time=2302] I did not feel welcomed and I was not enjoying myself, and I came home one day and made the pronouncement that I am going to quit. And my parents very carefully and lovingly sat
[time=2312] me down and said, "No, you are not going to quit." They were taking a principle from
[time=2318] the Word of God that says that character is more important than having fun. And they
[time=2324] were saying that once you have begun something, you will see that through because that is the commitment that you made to your coach and to your teammates, and also that is what builds you into the man that you need to be. I remember when I got my first job being sat
[time=2341] down by my dad. He said, "Now, son, this is a wonderful day in your life. You have your first job. Let me talk with you a little bit about your attitude toward your employer."
[time=2351] And he went on to describe for me the kind of go-get-em spirit and the energy that he
[time=2357] would expect me to bring to the job and to honor my employer and to think of his best
[time=2363] interests and to work a full day and to be an honest person inside that little job.
[time=2368] My dad was taking from me the principles of the Word of God and handing them to me and
[time=2374] saying this is how you should live as an employee. I remember going to school several different
[time=2385] times when you transition from grammar school into junior high school and then to high school.
[time=2389] And when I got my driver's license, which brought me into a whole new arena of thinking
[time=2395] about the authority that God had placed over me in the government and the police.
[time=2400] For my dad sitting me down and saying, "Son, you as a young man need to submit to authority."
[time=2408] My authority, the authority of the teacher, the authority of the principal, the authority of the policeman, the authority that God has put over your life. I remember my dad really
[time=2418] bringing that thought home as a young boy. When I would be disobedient to his authority, he would send me to his room, he would walk to the playroom, grab the ping pong paddle,
[time=2429] and he had this bad habit of slapping it against his leg as he came down the hall. And I could
[time=2436] hear him coming and it would send shivers up and down my spine. He would then explain to me what I had done wrong. He would then turn me over the bed and stop slapping his thigh and start slapping my bottom. Trying to say to me, "Russell, young men need to learn
[time=2453] to submit to authority." So he took the truth of God's word and he applied it to his own
[time=2460] life. And I saw my dad as one who submitted to authority. And I saw my dad as one who tried to live in the adversity of life as jobs would come and go and as difficult circumstances might enter into his life. And I saw the perseverance of my mother. And I even would see my mom
[time=2476] and dad at one point in their relationship have real trouble with each other. I noticed that things were not the same and there were real questions in my mind. They were not getting along. But I knew by then the Word of God had called them to a lifelong commitment to
[time=2493] each other. And so I'm thankful that I have been privileged to be in one of the households
[time=2500] still in America where that has not been torn apart. I count that a great privilege. They were hanging on to the truth in the Word of God. And I'll never forget Christmas of 1972.
[time=2510] I was 14 years of age. And I received a lot of different presents from my parents. I want you to know this. When I was in fourth grade I received my first rifle. My father and I hunted together often and I received my own, my very own rifle and a gun cover to go with it. I remember the Christmas that my dad gave me some snow skis because we skied together. I remember the Christmas that my folks gave me a Letterman's jacket because
[time=2533] that's where we were in the high school of all the presents that my folks gave me. And
[time=2539] all that it meant to our relationship, there's one that stands out above them all that cannot be compared to any of the others. It was in 1972 when I got a little box about this high
[time=2550] and about this wide and about this long and I opened it up and there was my very own for the very first time copy of God's Word. They had lived the truth. They have lived their
[time=2563] unified faith and eventually they came to the place where they then handed it to me,
[time=2569] the very Word of God. And with it came this card and I want to, if I may, read to you
[time=2575] the words that are there. It says, "Dear Russ, I was 14 years of age at the time. As you emerge into manhood, it is our prayer that this gift may become your closest friend.
[time=2587] That you may always seek its counsel as it has no human error. Where parents or friends
[time=2593] may falter, this will ever be truth." Underline it, write in it, make it your friend, make
[time=2600] it your very own. It is given with lots of love by two parents with great humility who
[time=2607] are watching the growth and maturity of a real man in Christ, Mary Christmas, mom and dad. You know what? The culture in America today and I really agree with what Steve has
[time=2618] said as I watch the youth of America today becoming increasingly pagan, increasingly
[time=2624] separated and divorced from the profound understanding that there is a God and that there is an instruction manual for life. And as the more the youth in America are pressured into that understanding, as they are beckoned in this way by the powerful voices of television
[time=2640] and media and movies and a strong, pure pressure that leads them into that kind of thinking and lifestyle, we find the suicide rates of youth in America rising in percentages we
[time=2651] have never seen in the history of this country before. We find pregnancy outside of wedlock and promiscuity in percentages we have never seen in this country before. We find problems
[time=2663] with our youth that are peculiar to this age which is peculiar to the disbelief of God
[time=2669] and the word of God. I believe with all my heart that what the families of this country
[time=2675] need is a unified faith in mother and father in the reality of God and the reality that
[time=2682] God has spoken as the principles by which to live life. The second thing I want you to notice in this verse about Moses family, then not only had a unified faith, they had a discerning faith. They had a discerning faith. Look at it again, verse 23, "By faith Moses
[time=2698] when he was born was hidden for three months by his parents." Why? Because they saw he
[time=2704] was a beautiful child. They had a discerning faith. They looked at that little guy and
[time=2711] apparently he was unusually handsome even as a baby. That was the area in which God had
[time=2717] given him a special gift. They looked at that little bundle of potential lying there in
[time=2724] whatever kind of wrappings he might have been in that day of age. They said it's impossible for us to think about destroying this much potential, this much life. As I read about
[time=2738] parents in our day and age, and I don't know, all of us may not be given a particular kind
[time=2745] of gift, whether it be appearance or whether it be intellect or whether it be athletic ability or whether it be relationships with people. But I believe that in every human being there is a raw level of potential which must be sought out by the parent. It must
[time=2758] be deserved, it must be pursued, it must be understood, it must be cultivated so that
[time=2764] that little life can stand on its own two feet in the unique way that God has prepared it to live. And yet you know what happens? They're saying now the studies are indicating
[time=2775] that of all the industrialized nations in the world, America is fast becoming the most illiterate.
[time=2788] illiterate and when you talk to the people who study the why, why are we becoming so illiterate, one of the critical factors they'll give you is that parents are not spending time with their children reinforcing the need to study and to learn. One survey I read said
[time=2805] that the average father spends five minutes a week individually with one of his children.
[time=2815] Now folks, I don't know what it is we're doing. That's so exciting. But if it's not
[time=2821] deserting the giftedness that God has placed in our children and spending the time that
[time=2827] it takes to cultivate that character and that level of contribution then I think our time
[time=2833] is misspent. I was talking with one father of our church this week and we took a moment
[time=2841] out of our weeks to spend some time together on the golf course. We played nine holes over here at Lakeside and I noticed he had a new set of clubs. I said those are wonderful clubs. Where did you get those? My son gave them to me. I said your son, having to know
[time=2857] his son is an high school. They were expensive clubs. So I probed a little further. I said
[time=2863] what in the world? He said well I don't know, I tried to get my son not to do that but he insisted. And then the father went on to say you know what, I think it may have something
[time=2874] to do with the fact that I've been helping him with his paper route. He said his paper route? Yeah for the last six years we've been getting up together every morning at 5 a.m.
[time=2886] to wrap the papers and put the rubber band around the papers and then to go out into the darkness and the cold on some parts of the year and deliver the papers. Seven days a week. I thought to myself now that. Now that is involvement. That's called I love you.
[time=2905] That's called I not only want you to learn character and discipline and a work ethic but just think of all the conversations that must have gone on between that father and that son at 5 in the morning with no telephone interruptions, no television on, nobody distracting
[time=2921] them but alone in the wee hours of the morning, morning after morning after morning after morning
[time=2927] for six years and finally the kid out of gratitude in his heart says dad I got to say thank you somehow. Here, that's some golf clubs, happy birthday. I don't know where
[time=2937] our form of involvement will come but I believe that what you find here in the life of Moses,
[time=2944] a little family four thousand years ago into the oppression of a hostile government was
[time=2950] first a unified faith and mother and father and then a discerning faith and parents that are willing to look and see and cultivate the giftedness and the character of an individual.
[time=2961] One last thing and we're finished. Thirdly, a practical faith. They had a practical faith. Look at it again verse 23. "By faith Moses when he was born was hidden for three months by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful child and they were not afraid of the king's edict." They put that faith into action. They did something with their belief system. They hid the child for three months and the reason it says three months is because at the end of three months he was developed enough that when he cried they couldn't hide him any longer. If you've ever heard this Old Testament story about Moses, it's a true thing. It actually happened. You could read about it in Exodus chapters one and two in the Old Testament there but when he got too big they knew he was going to be discovered and then he'd be put to death and maybe they'd be put to death. They made a little basket and they covered it with pitch and tar so that it wouldn't allow the water to get in. They made a little cabinet for the top, a little door for the top of this basket
[time=3016] and they placed the beautiful Moses inside the basket. They carried him down to the Nile River and they just by their own design made sure that they arrived at the very time when
[time=3026] Pharaoh, the king, the king's edict, his daughter would come down to the Nile River to bathe as was her custom with her court of maidens. They carried this little basket with their
[time=3038] little Moses and it was a risky thing for them. I'm sure their hearts were beating a hundred miles an hour as they put that little basket in the water and released it and allowed the current to run it down in front of Pharaoh's daughter and they had positioned Moses older
[time=3054] sister Miriam on the other side of the bank so she could watch and be in proximity to this whole thing. Just as God's providence would allow Pharaoh's daughter, had one of her maidens
[time=3066] pick that little basket up and open it up and when she saw that little child, she said, "We've got to save this kid even against the edict of her father." And Miriam by that time
[time=3078] had moved into position and she made the suggestion, "Well, maybe you could have one of the Hebrew ladies raise the child for you." And so Miriam, Moses older sister, got the okay to find a woman
[time=3090] and she brought Moses' mother and Moses was given back to his mother for about three years after
[time=3096] which time he was placed back in the court of Pharaoh and was raised in the highest household of the land, a practical faith, a practical faith.
[time=3105] Let me close with this picture if I can. It was shared with me first by a man by the name of Dr.
[time=3111] James Dobson. He's a child psychologist about 50 or 60 years of age and he has seen the change
[time=3119] and the shift in values in American culture today and this is his picture as we close.
[time=3125] He says, "It's almost as if our children coming up through the ages of five, six, and seven stand at the beginning of a long corridor, almost picturing a school situation, a long dark
[time=3138] corridor, and they've somehow got to make it from being a child to being an adult and this dangerous path is called adolescence. And as our children make their way down this dark
[time=3149] corridor, there are a number of doors on both sides of the corridor and they have labels on them.
[time=3154] They have the label of alcohol and they have the label of marijuana and they have the label of hard drugs and they have the label of pornography and they have the label of homosexual experimentation
[time=3165] and they have the label of premarital sex." They see in a sense we don't live under a government
[time=3172] that is trying to kill our children but we do live in a culture. We do live in a culture that is
[time=3179] prescribing and advocating and selling and advertising behavior down this corridor that very may well
[time=3186] kill our children. And as our children make their way down this corridor they come to these
[time=3193] doors and oftentimes the door is standing wide open as if to welcome them in and they'll even see inside their some of their friends involved in some of those kinds of activities saying, "Come on in,
[time=3205] come join us." The question is how in the world can we assist our children to make it down through
[time=3214] the corridor without finding their way into one of these rooms and being caught in addictive behavior that may take their life, certainly destroy it. We have a challenge today,
[time=3225] folks. It's a different day and it's a difficult day. And I guess what I want to say
[time=3233] as I wrap this up we've talked about a unified faith, a discerning faith and a practical faith
[time=3239] but I want to say this one last thing to you. Faith, the real value of faith is the object of your
[time=3246] faith. The real value of faith is what you put your faith in and you've heard the testimonies
[time=3252] this morning in both of these families and I'll be a third testimony with you and I know there are many others in the room today that have said we have placed our faith in the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=3264] God's Son, who came from heaven took the form of human flesh so many years ago that Christmas mourn
[time=3272] lived the perfect life, died on the cross for our sins, was buried in the third day rose from the
[time=3281] dead. That very Jesus is alive today and he seeks to come into your life, to come into your heart
[time=3287] and to give you the strength to live according to the manual. Believe me it'll make a difference,
[time=3295] it'll change things. It'll give you and your spouse the energy from within to live the life
[time=3302] that God would have you live and to pass that virtue on to your children. Secondly I want to say
[time=3310] this, I believe in the church and I believe in it more today than I ever had before because I don't
[time=3318] think that we're supposed to live out there as isolated little families down on that street and over there on that street and over there on that street, as isolated little families trying to stand against a culture that is capable of destroying our family. I believe that what we're not supposed to do is what we're doing this morning and what we do around here during the week and what so many other churches in the city which we support and we're thankful they're here. Do every
[time=3340] week. They gather people together of that unified faith and that light precious faith and they represent a positive peer pressure to each other and encouragement and love and strength.
[time=3349] So if you're with us this morning and you're visiting we want to say that this is a church and
[time=3356] there are other churches in this city that again we support and if you find your way into one of those praise the Lord there's really no competition at that level. We would just be concerned that you come to a personal knowledge of the person of Jesus Christ accepting him into your heart, confessing your sin and saying I give my life to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3375] And then we would encourage you having made that decision to say but we can't do that out there by ourselves. We want to find a church with good strong ministries for children and for family to
[time=3389] reinforce what we're trying to do with our family in this day.
[time=3394] And we'd love to help you with that. Would you bow your heads and close your eyes as we have a
[time=3401] closing word of prayer? What a wonderful service we've had today. The music is from our sanctuary
[time=3413] choir and orchestra and our special guest Steve and Maria and Mandy Gardner from Colorado.
[time=3419] Our message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore. Just before we close let me ask
[time=3425] you this question. Do you know Jesus Christ is your personal Savior? You can today. Let's bow
[time=3431] and pray this prayer together if you want to know him as a personal Lord and Savior of your heart.
[time=3436] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for the privilege to come before you today and tell you that I
[time=3442] don't know you as my Savior and I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today. I pray this in your name. Amen. I hope that if you prayed that prayer
[time=3455] together with me that you'll write and tell us the nature of your decision and we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
