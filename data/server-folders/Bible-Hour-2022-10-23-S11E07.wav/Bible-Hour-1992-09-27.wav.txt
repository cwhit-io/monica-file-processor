[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - On one occasion, we find in the Gospel of John
[time=51] that Jesus wept. He wept. Nothing reveals a man's
[time=59] compassion. And I want to use the word man, masculinity, a man's compassion that
[time=67] when a man was shed his tears for a friend. And the compassion that Christ had for
[time=76] his friend, Lazarus. It's the same compassion he has for you that he has for me.
[time=94] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today we are pleased to
[time=105] have as our special speaker, Alex Montoya from Los Angeles, California. Alex will be speaking on the compassion Christ exhibited for people and how we should in like manner demonstrate compassion toward our fellow man. We encourage you to locate your Bible. Today's
[time=121] message will be from the book of Matthew chapter 9 verses 35 through 38. Our special music
[time=130] today will feature the sanctuary choir, Scott Schindler, and Marilyn Wong. Let's now join
[time=139] our service.
[time=160] We are gathered in this house to celebrate his name, to tell him we're happy, so happy
[time=180] again.
[time=187] We know we're made worthy by the party game. We stand here as sofies of his power to
[time=202] pray, oh, we worship, oh, we worship, oh, we worship, oh, we worship, oh, we worship,
[time=606] (upbeat music)
[time=636] (audience applauds) (audience applauds)
[time=665] - Well, thank you for watching the Bible Hour today.
[time=668] Russell, this has been a wonderful weekend, in particular for our men of our church.
[time=672] - That's right, Pete.
[time=673] We've just concluded our second annual men's retreat.
[time=676] We had about 150 men retreating together around the word of God, and we invited Dr. Alex Montoya from East Los Angeles to be our speaker.
[time=685] And really, this is just one of the many ministries that go on at Black Hawk Baptist Church for members of the family.
[time=692] And I would love to encourage you, if you do not have a regular church that you attend, but you see us occasionally on the Bible Hour, really, I would say that's not enough.
[time=703] The Bible teaches you to need a church family that you fellowship with that you're a part of, and we love to meet your need in that way.
[time=710] - I really echo Pastor Russ's remarks that we want you to come and join with us, visit us, and find out all the extra ministries that you don't see by way of television that are offered to you and your family.
[time=723] So come and join us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=726] I want to tell you that if you're in the Fort Wayne area tonight, you can come and see the miracles.
[time=732] We've been talking about them on television.
[time=734] This is a group of young people who are mildly to quite severely disabled, sing and play instruments, and they'll be a blessing to your heart.
[time=742] So if you're in this area, come tonight, October 4th, at 6 p.m., and join with us for this marvelous presentation.
[time=750] And then I want to tell you about the program that we've started in recording 10 of our soloists.
[time=756] We're about halfway through the project, and we're going to make available a cassette of some of the music that you hear right on the Bible hour.
[time=764] And you can receive a copy of this cassette.
[time=766] I hope that you'll write for it now.
[time=768] Send us a donation of $10 or more, and in just a few weeks, we'll release that cassette, and it'll be yours for your listening pleasure.
[time=775] I think it'll be an inspiration to you.
[time=777] Also, we want to talk to you a little bit about the fact that you'll be receiving a letter in the mail soon.
[time=784] All of you that are Founders Club members requesting living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=789] For us, it's hard to believe that at that time of the year, we need to plan ahead.
[time=793] And I hope that you'll respond to that letter and get back to us as soon as possible for your ideal choice of the time and date that you want to come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=803] So be watching for that letter.
[time=805] We're also grateful for those of you who are not members of the Founders Club, but responded to our letter a couple weeks ago from Pastor Russ asking you to contribute to the Bible Hour.
[time=815] We hope that you'll just have a real desire to continue to support our ministry.
[time=820] We count on the Founders Club members and people like you to just help us in our ministry here on the Bible Hour.
[time=829] We're going to go back to the regular portion of our service now with some more music, and then the message from our special guest, Alex Montoya.
[time=836] I hope that you'll stay tuned for the rest of our program.
[time=841] [MUSIC]
[time=854] >> That precious blood that flows from Calvary can make,
[time=862] the sinner holy, come wash me clean till every part
[time=871] of me is your Lord and yours only.
[time=879] It's been so long since I've felt Jesus just once again.
[time=888] I long to feel His presence.
[time=893] I want to be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
[time=899] I need a cleansing from the fountain.
[time=903] >> My soul is hungry.

[time=916] How oft I've cried when far away from you, my heart,
[time=925] would catch a glimpse of Calvary remembering nights
[time=931] down on my knees in prayer.
[time=936] I'd say, Lord, here I am.
[time=939] Please use me, a fool would die to ever leave you.
[time=948] Please take me now.
[time=950] Oh God, I know I need you.

[time=997] I want to be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
[time=1020] [ Applause ]
[time=1027] >> Thank you, Marilyn.
[time=1028] Beautiful song and a testimony of her life.
[time=1031] Just as she seeks to serve the Lord, she and Kurt, her husband as faithful partners in the gospel ministry here at this church, I'm so thankful for them.
[time=1041] Well, we return from a tremendous men's retreat.
[time=1044] I'll thank you for praying and say a special word of thanks to Chuck Frederick, our staff member who organized the retreat and did all the behind the scenes work for our men's retreat.
[time=1054] About 150 of us have just spent the last couple of days up at Oak Hill with the theme of discipleship, reproducing yourself.
[time=1063] And the Lord has worked greatly in our time together.
[time=1066] And this morning we have the privilege of hearing again from our retreat speaker, Dr. Alex Montoya.
[time=1073] And some months ago when I was settling on the theme of discipleship and reproducing yourself and thinking through who we might have to lead the charge, so to speak, and being our keynote speaker, the very first person that came into my mind was Alex Montoya.
[time=1088] Not just because he's a tremendous communicator of the Word of God, but because he has lived the very theme we were addressing, discipleship and reproduction.
[time=1098] Dr. Montoya is the pastor of First Fundamental Bible Church in Monterey Park in Southern California.
[time=1104] He's been the pastor there for 20 years.
[time=1106] And as he began his ministry he found that his church just continued to grow and so they found another facility to hold a few more people, but finally, there in Southern California when they'd reached about 800 or 900 people they just couldn't find a bigger property or a bigger building to accommodate that.
[time=1123] And so they were kind of almost forced or led by the Spirit of God into the whole ministry of reproducing themselves.
[time=1129] And today that church has spawned 15 other churches.
[time=1133] And all that leadership and all the cultivation of the vision and the men have come up through Alex's ministry and those churches are doing well and thriving for the cause of Christ.
[time=1142] Beyond that, Alex about 1975 became aware of the fact through his own study that there were about 100 Hispanics training for the ministry in the traditional seminaries of America, Monterey Park, East Los Angeles, the city of Los Angeles has about 4 million Hispanics living there.
[time=1162] And you know the Hispanic population in America is the fastest growing minority in all of the United States.
[time=1169] They are out birthing the Caucasians 5 to 1 and so it is a tremendous group of people, not just in Southern California, but in the major cities of America.
[time=1178] A population that needs to be reached in its unique and special way and an expression of the Great Commission.
[time=1185] Now, Alex became concerned when he realized that there were only 100 men, Hispanic men training for ministry around the country.
[time=1193] And as he probed that a little more deeply, even in his own community, he found that there were three major obstacles holding these men back from training.
[time=1200] One was time.
[time=1202] Most of these men who had come to Christ and were feeling a call into the ministry had families and therefore were responsible to work a full-time job.
[time=1210] And they couldn't break away from their job to go to formal training as it was being offered in traditional seminaries.
[time=1217] Secondly, he found that money was a tremendous obstacle.
[time=1219] Again, the responsibility not just to work full-time but also to provide money for the family, how then could they come up with tuition money.
[time=1226] And then language was a third barrier that he found the traditional seminaries in America are teaching in English.
[time=1232] And many of the men who really were on fire for Christ and had a vision to save people and build churches couldn't speak English, only Spanish.
[time=1241] So Alex, by God's grace, along with his home church, started the Southern California School of Ministry, which is a 90-unit seminary to train men for the ministry.
[time=1251] And he removed effectively all three barriers.
[time=1254] First of all, as to money that's free, there is no tuition to go to the seminary because the professors who teach in those classrooms do it on a voluntary basis and they do it without charge.
[time=1265] And there is no building.
[time=1266] They instead hold their classes in churches that donate that facility for their class time.
[time=1273] And as to time, they have developed a schedule for their classes that can be conducted in the evening so that the men can continue to work during the day and then go in the evening to take their classes and eventually complete the full curriculum that is needed or required of them.
[time=1287] And then thirdly, all the classes are taught in Spanish in their native tongue.
[time=1291] And so that they can go into some of the complex subject matter of the theologies and the original languages and all the rest and find not the additional barrier then of a different language because it's all taught in Spanish.
[time=1302] And today, they have 45 men in training for the pulpit.
[time=1307] So we bring to you a man today to speak to us and to my heart and to your heart not just on discipleship but on what the Lord has laid upon his heart today but he comes with great credentials out of his own life as he has been led by the Spirit of God.
[time=1321] And we are so thankful, the group of us that were at retreat that he had come and spent time with us.
[time=1326] And I think by the end of the hour, you're going to be thankful for your time with him as well.
[time=1330] Would you welcome to Blackhawk Baptist Church, Dr. Alex Montoya.
[time=1334] [ Applause ]
[time=1346] >> It's a delight to be with you this morning.
[time=1348] I want to put you at ease.
[time=1350] I'm not going to be preaching in Spanish so we can just relax and it will be in English.
[time=1353] There are a lot of Hispanics in California, millions of them.
[time=1357] Texan went down to California recently and he was driving down the freeways down the city streets and he saw the millions of Hispanics and he was convinced that they were there.
[time=1368] And then he passed by a Taco Bell when he said, "Man, these folks even have their own telephone company." [ Laughter ] We don't.
[time=1378] I've enjoyed being with the men from Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=1382] We had a great retreat.
[time=1384] I enjoyed myself thoroughly and they are a great bunch of fellows.
[time=1389] They love God, they love the Lord.
[time=1391] And it was great to see the interaction that we had in sharing the messages.
[time=1395] But more than that, just the fellowship afterwards around the table and talking and I can sense the love of God and that these men love the Lord Jesus Christ and they must come from very good families.
[time=1406] I also appreciate very much the ministry of your pastor, Pastor Russ, and what God has raised him up for a special job.
[time=1416] As I told the men on the retreat, Pastor Russ reminds me of that pink bunny that you see on television beating his drum.
[time=1424] You know, he's forever doing something, you know.
[time=1429] And it's the energy that is there.
[time=1432] And so I appreciate so much our friendship and the invitation to come and be with the men and then to be with you here this morning.
[time=1439] It's a wonderful, wonderful privilege for me to be here.
[time=1442] And I'm just amazed at Indiana.
[time=1445] Last time I came, it was blizzard and snow and no leaves and it was just terrible.
[time=1451] And I can't prepare it for that, for blizzard and snow and came with jacket and sweatshirts and lo and behold, it's 65 degrees outside, the sun's shining, the grass is green, the leaves are still on the trees.
[time=1466] And I don't know what to say.
[time=1469] And I told my wife, just last night I said, you know, honey, it's not 32 below here.
[time=1474] It's fine and I just can't get over this thing.
[time=1478] I've been coughing all morning.
[time=1481] The weather's so clean, so pure.
[time=1483] You see, in L.A., the birds don't sing.
[time=1486] They cough, you know.
[time=1487] [LAUGHTER] So when you leave that environment, when you get used to the smog, it's hard to get used to clean air.
[time=1495] I can hardly wait to get back home and start breathing normally once again.
[time=1500] So yeah, we're having a great time and so we thank you.
[time=1504] And we pray that you will pray for us when you think of the minister in California and all the things that are wrong there.
[time=1511] I want you to know that there are some things that are right and that God is alive and that God is still on the throne and that He will save and He will accomplish His work even in a reprobate state like California.
[time=1524] So pray for us.
[time=1526] This morning, please open your Bibles to the Book of Matthew, the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Matthew, the 9th chapter.
[time=1537] The Gospel of Matthew, the 9th chapter.
[time=1539] I spoke in a theme of discipleship at our men's retreat.
[time=1548] Along the same lines, I'd like us to come to chapter 9 of the Gospel of Matthew and our text for this morning will be Matthew 9, 35 through 38.
[time=1557] The Gospel of Matthew, chapter 9, verses 35 through 38.
[time=1562] We'll read the text together and then we'll make some observations on this.
[time=1565] And Jesus was going about all the cities and the villages
[time=1572] teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
[time=1581] And seeing the multitudes, He felt compassion for them because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd.
[time=1589] And then He said to the disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[time=1595] Therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into His harvest.
[time=1601] And there's an aspect of the Lord's life that I'd like to address this morning that I think every last one of us need to have in our lives.
[time=1612] And that's the word compassion, compassion.
[time=1616] Compassion is the driving force behind discipleship.
[time=1620] Compassion ought to be the driving force behind all that we do in our Christian experience.
[time=1627] And if you can identify one trait of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=1633] the fact that He was extremely compassion.
[time=1637] And Matthew, as He recounts the life of Christ, brings to us an incident in His life.
[time=1645] One occasion when finishing a particular ministry surrounded
[time=1651] by the throngs of people, this took place.
[time=1655] At seeing the multitudes, He felt compassion for them because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd.
[time=1664] It was Charles Spurgeon who said once, he says, I marvel.
[time=1668] I marvel at how quickly my heart turns cold.
[time=1672] And you that know Christ and you that know church history know that there is probably no greater churchmen and preacher than Charles Spurgeon, a great soulinner, a great servant of God.
[time=1684] And yet, He said, I marvel how quickly my heart turns cold.
[time=1689] And I can identify with that statement because my heart also turns cold.
[time=1694] And the passion that I should have for people and the passion I should have for the ministry, I lose it and I grow cold.
[time=1703] And perhaps it happens to you as well, that your zeal and your compassion for people turns cold.
[time=1714] And so this morning, for my benefit and for your benefit, that you and I might be encouraged to be zealous and making disciples and serving God and giving Him our very best.
[time=1728] I'd like to have you look with me at this passage and see how it is that our Lord Jesus Christ had this great heart of compassion and how He maintained this compassion.
[time=1738] Because if we can learn His secret and make the applications to our lives, then we too.
[time=1743] We too can stay on the cutting edge of ministry, stay on the cutting edge of discipleship, and be zealous and fired up for God.
[time=1754] Let's look carefully at this text.
[time=1756] Verse 35, "I draw your attention to the word and Jesus and Jesus."
[time=1766] And that helps identify why Christ had compassion.
[time=1769] You see, the word "and Jesus" reminds us of the fact that He was born.
[time=1773] And before being born, He was to be called Jesus.
[time=1778] And it was said to the Virgin Mary, "You shall call His name Jesus, for it is He that would save His people from their sins." The name Jesus identifies reveals that our Lord Jesus Christ came down and He identified with humanity.
[time=1795] He became flesh and the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory.
[time=1801] That this God who loved us so much didn't love us from a distance, but He loved us up close.
[time=1809] He didn't love us from afar.
[time=1812] He loved us from within.
[time=1814] So much so that He came down and He identified with us.
[time=1818] And the name Jesus, whenever you come across the name Jesus, it speaks of His humanity, that God became flesh, and people touched Him.
[time=1829] But more than that, that He touched our lives.
[time=1832] Jesus identified with humanity.
[time=1838] We need to do the same thing.
[time=1841] We need to identify with our fellow men.
[time=1844] People are flesh and blood.
[time=1846] You know, a number of months ago, you've read about it.
[time=1848] I'm sure you saw it on television.
[time=1850] The great riots that we had in the LA area.
[time=1855] And you from afar, you saw on television, you read about it.
[time=1858] But we were there, and we felt it.
[time=1862] We felt the anxiety, the fear, the anger.
[time=1867] And on one occasion, I was watching television that curfewed the whole town so nobody could leave their homes.
[time=1873] And we sat and watched hour upon hour and hour upon hour of live action, people looting, and burning, and destroying.
[time=1882] Now recall my daughter, she's 19 years of age.
[time=1885] And she said, Dad, Dad, turn the television off.
[time=1890] Turn it off, and she was in the verge of tears.
[time=1894] In other words, how can people behave this way?
[time=1897] And you know, it wasn't blacks.
[time=1899] And it wasn't browns.
[time=1901] Friends, it was everybody was in it.
[time=1904] Everyone was in it of every color.
[time=1909] It was raw humanity involved.
[time=1911] And we identified with that.
[time=1918] That was us.
[time=1924] Friends, that wasn't Angelino's, that was you, and that was me.
[time=1931] We can begin to have compassion for people when we identify ourselves as human beings, and then we belong to the same race.
[time=1942] We belong to the same group of people called human beings.
[time=1949] The poet put it this way.
[time=1952] He says, when you hear the bell toll, don't ask for whom the bell tolls.
[time=1957] The tolls for thee.
[time=1960] That we are identified, we are of one group.
[time=1964] When one part of the world suffers, we suffer together.
[time=1968] And when Jesus Christ became man, He entered into the lives of human beings.
[time=1973] He now became one of us.
[time=1976] He was now one of us.
[time=1979] And we need to mentally, we need to mentally put ourselves
[time=1985] and not speak of them and those people and those godless
[time=1992] and those out there.
[time=1994] But to speak as if we say, this is my family.
[time=1999] This is my human race.
[time=2001] They are mine.
[time=2003] I belong to this race.
[time=2008] And Jesus, the name Jesus reminds us of that.
[time=2013] May I also draw your attention to verse 35, where it goes on to say, and Jesus was going about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
[time=2028] What I marvel about Christ himself is that he entered into the daily affairs of mankind.
[time=2033] He wasn't afraid to touch people.
[time=2037] And almost to remind us, Matthew says that he went about.
[time=2044] He was involved in the villages.
[time=2046] He didn't walk people from a distance, not from the clouds of heaven.
[time=2052] He wasn't going through a monitor.
[time=2054] It wasn't through letters.
[time=2056] He was there.
[time=2057] He walked in the streets.
[time=2060] He touched people's lives.
[time=2063] You know what's our tendency, people of God.
[time=2065] It's our tendency, people of God, to want to stay away from people, from their hurting, from those that are unlovely and then godly.
[time=2075] We like to withdraw and build our little kingdoms and our little walls and isolate ourselves.
[time=2083] In the LA basin, we call it sometimes white flight.
[time=2087] But it's not just white.
[time=2088] It's everybody.
[time=2089] It's white flight and black slack and brown frown and yellow mellow, everybody's leaving.
[time=2097] You see, we don't want to be involved in the problems of people.
[time=2100] But one thing about Christ, my dear friends, is that he went down and he touched the lives of people.
[time=2106] He was down there.
[time=2107] He wasn't afraid to get dirty.
[time=2109] He wasn't afraid to be-- to touch people's lives.
[time=2113] He was with the poor and with the rich, with lepers.
[time=2117] He touched the lepers.
[time=2118] He touched the children.
[time=2119] He brought them and he sat them on his lap and he blessed them.
[time=2124] Things that people in his generation were unwilling to do.
[time=2128] They accused them one day.
[time=2129] He says, why?
[time=2131] Why do you sit with tax-gatherers and sinners?
[time=2135] What business do you have as a man of God?
[time=2138] Touching the lives of these godless, lawless people.
[time=2144] And he said, don't you know?
[time=2146] Don't you know that those that are well, they don't need a physician.
[time=2151] It's those that are sick that need a physician.
[time=2155] I have not come to call the righteous.
[time=2157] I have come to call sinners under repentance.
[time=2162] You see, you can't have compassion for sinners unless you sit down with them, unless you walk where they walk, unless you live where they live.
[time=2173] Friend, don't criticize the poor until you go to the villages and when you go across town and you visit the poor people in their homes, then you can criticize the poor.
[time=2183] Don't criticize the single parents until you've been with single parents and you've seen what they go through.
[time=2192] When I'm saying to you, it's easy for us to sit on the outside and look across the street or across the river or across town and have no compassion for anybody else because we have not bothered to get involved in the lives of people.
[time=2207] We need to.
[time=2210] But it goes against our nature.
[time=2213] But Allah reminded us by going through all the cities and all the villages and touching people's lives, touching people's lives.
[time=2223] There's a little sister, not my sister.
[time=2229] She's called Sister Teresa.
[time=2231] You've heard about her in the news.
[time=2233] Not on his spouse or theology.
[time=2236] But she won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for our quality known as compassion.
[time=2242] That's why.
[time=2244] Because she was willing to get down where people are.
[time=2248] A few months ago, she was done in Baca, La Fortuna, Tijuana.
[time=2251] And she became deathly ill.
[time=2253] Deathly ill because it's her practice to live the way the people live.
[time=2258] If they are hungry, she is hungry.
[time=2260] If they are dirty, she is dirty.
[time=2262] If they are suffering, she is suffering.
[time=2264] She tries to epitomize in her life this Christ-like trait called compassion.
[time=2271] And you and I can sit and criticize her theology.
[time=2274] But may I say to you, we ought to at least imitate her practical theology of compassion.
[time=2282] I ask myself, who have I touched recently?
[time=2286] I ask myself into whose daily affairs have I entered recently?
[time=2291] Am I afraid?
[time=2292] Am I afraid to become contaminated?
[time=2295] Am I afraid to have other people influence my life?
[time=2298] You heard a story of David Brainerd, that great Christian preacher of the colonial days.
[time=2304] A great man of God, great promising career as a preacher and a theologian.
[time=2312] And when a scourge came through the colonies, a plague of pneumonia, and you recall
[time=2322] that they told him about a certain home and a certain place where a lady was very ill, and he said, I must go tell her about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2333] And yet knowing that if he went, he himself might get sick.
[time=2338] But he went anyway because he had compassion, the compassion of Christ.
[time=2342] And that visit that brought this person to Christ also cost him his life, cost him his life.
[time=2350] But he knew that.
[time=2352] He had the heart, the heart of Christ inside of him, compassion for people.
[time=2358] And sometimes I need to say to myself, Alex, you need to step out of your self-righteous path.
[time=2367] And Alex, turn away from this sense of trying to find security in life, and get down and touch the lives of people.
[time=2374] And I say to you this morning the same thing,
[time=2384] have you built a little wall?
[time=2386] Have you built moats around your home and around your life?
[time=2390] Are you afraid to step out of the comfort zone?
[time=2397] Has your heart become so hardened that you cannot walk
[time=2404] into the lives of other people and share Christ with them
[time=2410] and share the love of Christ with them?
[time=2412] Not so our Lord, and I am so thankful.
[time=2419] Not so our Lord who came down and lived among us and walked among us, visited our villages.
[time=2428] Those are the suburbs and visited our cities, and saw all manner of people depressed and downcast,
[time=2439] and he touched them, and he helped them.
[time=2443] How are you doing?
[time=2446] How am I doing?
[time=2448] May God help us.
[time=2451] May God help us to begin to melt this scale of hardness
[time=2457] we have built over our hearts, and soften us, and give us a heart for other people.
[time=2465] May I draw you attention to verse 36 of our text this morning?
[time=2470] Because the text was on to say, and seeing the multitudes, and seeing the multitudes, he felt compassion.
[time=2476] Now notice that the felt compassion is preceded by a previous action.
[time=2482] First he saw, then he felt.
[time=2485] Did you notice that?
[time=2487] First he sees, and then he feels.
[time=2491] Because if you don't see, you cannot feel.
[time=2496] And Jesus saw, and so he felt.
[time=2498] We live in a culture today where we don't see individuals.
[time=2505] We don't see individuals, we just see masses.
[time=2508] We see masses of people.
[time=2510] And it's to our own detriment that we can see masses of people,
[time=2517] but we don't see any faces.
[time=2520] We are just nameless entities in this planet.
[time=2526] But that's not so with Christ.
[time=2531] When Christ saw this multitude, he saw people.
[time=2536] He saw the Marys, and the Tom's, and the Larry's, and the John's, and the Sally's of life.
[time=2543] He saw them as individuals.
[time=2545] He saw the problems, their cares, their concerns.
[time=2548] He saw that they were downcast and distressed.
[time=2553] He saw that on the veneer and the outside, things seemed to be OK.
[time=2558] But Jesus had the ability to look at the eyes and see inside the soul, and to know that something was wrong with these people.
[time=2566] He learned to look at people's lives and get inside of them.
[time=2571] He learned to read them.
[time=2574] What happens to us is that we don't see people anymore.
[time=2583] We just see masses.
[time=2585] We see numbers.
[time=2588] We don't see individuals.
[time=2591] We see sales prospects.
[time=2595] We see people that are going to help us advance our own personal cause.
[time=2599] We see the shakers and the movers of life, and we want to get them on our team and use them to propel us up into life.
[time=2608] We don't see people.
[time=2611] And I want to remind myself and remind you that the quality of Christ was that he could see people.
[time=2616] He even spoke about a man that had 100 sheep.
[time=2620] You know the story.
[time=2621] You've heard it in Sunday school.
[time=2623] They've given us a zillion times.
[time=2625] A man had 100 sheep.
[time=2629] And when he counted them, 97, 98, 99, there was one miss.
[time=2638] And he said he left the 99, and went out
[time=2646] to the countryside to find the sheep that had gone astray.
[time=2650] Why?
[time=2651] Because he had 100 sheep, and every last one of them was important to him.
[time=2657] You know, God has over a 5 billion sheep, and every last one of them is important to him.
[time=2663] They are here this morning, many of them.
[time=2665] You and I, and each one has a name and a face, creator of God.
[time=2673] And God cares for the individual.
[time=2676] He sees, he sees the multitudes.
[time=2681] May I challenge us this morning, my friends, to learn to see people, to learn to see people?
[time=2689] Don't see the masses.
[time=2691] See individuals.
[time=2694] See the cellies, and the johnnies, and the tummies of life.
[time=2698] Are you with me?
[time=2701] For the heart of preach of this congregation, because where I come from, people say, amen.
[time=2705] That's right, pastor.
[time=2706] Preach it.
[time=2707] This is a real quiet crowd.
[time=2708] So I have a hard time understanding whether I'm getting through or not.
[time=2713] Amen, I got one.
[time=2714] OK.
[time=2715] Now we got it.
[time=2716] We're on a roll now.
[time=2717] OK.
[time=2717] You know, friends, we can have all kinds of excuses
[time=2723] why we can't be concerned about all these people.
[time=2725] There's so many people out there.
[time=2727] We can, we just start developing all kinds of excuses as to why we can't.
[time=2731] We'd be looking out for everybody.
[time=2733] Many times we just say, well, these people have so many problems.
[time=2737] There's so many-- there's so downcast and so distress.
[time=2739] I can never help these people.
[time=2741] That problem's beyond my ability.
[time=2743] By more than that, Alex, you know, it's just their fault.
[time=2746] It's their fault.
[time=2747] They should have come to Christ.
[time=2749] They should have stayed in the church.
[time=2750] They should read their Bibles.
[time=2751] They should pray, you know.
[time=2752] These people are suffering because it's just their fault.
[time=2757] That's not Christ's spirit.
[time=2761] And you know what it is, their fault.
[time=2764] Well, I'll be the first to agree.
[time=2765] And so will God be the first to agree that it is their fault.
[time=2769] But it doesn't excuse us from not being compassionate towards them.
[time=2773] We may say, well, there's so many of them.
[time=2778] There's so many of them.
[time=2780] What can I do as so many-- I like that story about the little fellow that was out by the seashore.
[time=2784] And he was trying to save some starfish from drying up in the hot sun.
[time=2788] The tide was going back.
[time=2789] And he was out collecting starfish and throwing them back in, and throwing them back in, and just spent his morning collecting starfish.
[time=2795] And this man walking by, he said, hey, son, what are you doing?
[time=2799] He says, I'm collecting starfish because they're burning up and they're going to die.
[time=2802] He said, son, there are so many there, hundreds here.
[time=2805] What can you do with all these starfish?
[time=2807] You can't help them.
[time=2808] Oh, what does it matter?
[time=2810] He said, Mr. It matters to this one.
[time=2812] And I'm saying to you today, my dear friend,
[time=2819] it matters to this one and it matters to that one.
[time=2823] Yes or no?
[time=2824] Man, does it matter to you that somebody saved you?
[time=2827] Does it matter to you?
[time=2828] A one, doesn't it?
[time=2830] You see, God has not asked you to save the masses.
[time=2833] He's asked you to save the one.
[time=2836] He's asked to not ask you to pick everybody up and put them all on your shoulder or something.
[time=2841] There'll be an atlas.
[time=2843] He's only asked you to pick up the one.
[time=2845] That's all, isn't that true?
[time=2849] To see the one and to pick them up.
[time=2853] Well, you know, Alex, if I start doing that, it's going to jeopardize, it's going to cramp my lifestyle.
[time=2858] Man, if I start stopping for every Tom Dick and Harry in town and picking every spiritual hitchhiker that needs a ride, if I start doing that, it's going to cramp my lifestyle.
[time=2871] Well, great.
[time=2873] And so it might, but it might just do the exact opposite.
[time=2880] And it might just give you the chance to really begin to live, because God said to us that a man's life does not consist of his possessions.
[time=2889] There's a great Indian evangelist, Sar Sundasin,
[time=2897] one of the finest Indian evangelists of all time.
[time=2900] Now, stories told one day when he and his companion were going to another village to preach the gospel, that they got a sudden blizzard, a sudden snowstorm.
[time=2909] And you must know about these snowstorms here.
[time=2912] And they got, they were culled, and they were sudden.
[time=2914] And they began to get on this journey, and they knew that they had to make it to the next village, or they were going to phrase the death.
[time=2919] And so they quickened their pace along the way.
[time=2921] And as they quickened their pace along the way, they came across this bundle on the roadside.
[time=2925] They stumbled over it, and when they stopped to look at it, it was a human being on the verge of freezing to death.
[time=2931] And Sar Sundasin said to his friend, we need to stop and pick up this man and take him to the city before he phrases the death.
[time=2937] And the companion said, no, we can't.
[time=2938] If we stop, we will all die.
[time=2941] You will die, he will die, I will die.
[time=2946] We cannot stop, sir.
[time=2950] And Sar said, we must stop.
[time=2952] He said, you will stop, but I will not stop.
[time=2955] I will leave you here.
[time=2956] And the companion took off and left.
[time=2960] And Sar Sundasin picked up this bundle of humanity and put him on his back and began to carry him through the snow storm.
[time=2969] And as they walked and walked and walked in due time,
[time=2975] Sar Sundasin came across another bundle of humanity on the roadside.
[time=2980] And as he stopped to look at this other human being, it was his friend who now had frozen to death.
[time=2990] And was dead.
[time=2992] And Sar Sundasin continued his journey and rescued this stranger.
[time=2999] But he also saved his own life.
[time=3002] Because you know in life, when you live for yourself, you live a short life.
[time=3009] But when you live for others, you live a long life.
[time=3013] When you only live to protect your own self, you don't draw deep from the energies of life within.
[time=3018] But when you live for the lives of others, you draw from resources you didn't even know you had.
[time=3025] When you stop and pick up the wafer, when you pick up that hitchhiker, when you pick up one human being on the road of life, and you put him on your shoulder's friend, you will live a full life.
[time=3039] You will live a full life.
[time=3041] The kind of life that Christ has taught us.
[time=3044] There are some of you today.
[time=3045] You are living a selfish life, a self-centered life, and you will live a short life.
[time=3052] You will have money and things and prestige.
[time=3055] But when it's all said and done, your life will be a zero.
[time=3059] Because there is no heart.
[time=3062] You know heart.
[time=3064] You're a statue.
[time=3066] You're a metal thing moving.
[time=3068] But inside, there is no life.
[time=3072] May I say to you this morning, put some life in your soul, put some life in your own body, become a human being, and have compassion for somebody else.
[time=3084] And the only way that can ever take place is if you stop and pick up someone who is distressed and downcast, who's laying low in the pathway of life and pick him up and put him on your shoulder and stoop over and get on with living.
[time=3100] And you live a long, happy life.
[time=3106] That's compassion.
[time=3109] Jesus taught us that seeing the multitudes, seeing people,
[time=3122] people in your block, in your neighborhood, we don't see them.
[time=3129] The little kids, you could bring to church and you don't bring them.
[time=3132] So busy bringing yourself to church.
[time=3135] Don't have time for them.
[time=3138] That fellow you work with, so busy you don't see him.
[time=3146] Punches in, punches out.
[time=3149] He's going through divorce, crisis.
[time=3152] We never see that.
[time=3155] So busy with their own little program, little agenda.
[time=3158] I encourage you this morning, myself too, look to people,
[time=3167] don't see masses, see faces.
[time=3170] Take an interest in them.
[time=3174] You follow with me as well.
[time=3182] In verse 36, something else that helped us keep compassion.
[time=3192] See, the words, he felt compassion.
[time=3195] We are many times misunderstood that.
[time=3197] The Greek word for that of which your pastor is a Greek scholar will later on tell you what it is and explain it to you.
[time=3203] I don't have time this morning.
[time=3205] That Greek word is a word that has to do with taking the visceral area of your body and twisting it around until it
[time=3216] hurts.
[time=3218] He was moved in his bowels.
[time=3220] You see, when you hurt, when your heart hurts,
[time=3228] it is your whole being that hurts.
[time=3229] And it's not as though Christ came and saw all these masses
[time=3235] there.
[time=3235] And he said, well, poor people, wow, look at all these massive people, so distressed, so downcast, almost like last sheep, my, my, my, we need to help these people.
[time=3245] That wasn't the idea at all.
[time=3246] It's like he stopped and he looked and then pain gripped him.
[time=3262] And his face was contorted, tears filled his eyes.
[time=3269] He was in pain.
[time=3273] Their pain became his pain.
[time=3280] Their struggles became his struggles.
[time=3283] And he entered into their pain.
[time=3285] That's what the word compassion means, to share the same pain someone else is sharing.
[time=3291] You know, friends, compassion is painful.
[time=3296] I don't like to hurt the way you don't like to hurt.
[time=3302] It's painful.
[time=3308] I don't have to be involved with people because people have
[time=3315] pains and then I have pains.
[time=3319] And they cry.
[time=3320] And men don't cry as often as readily as women do.
[time=3326] I found that when I married my wife, she cried over anything and everything.
[time=3332] I'd say, baby, how come you're crying?
[time=3333] I don't know.
[time=3334] What do you mean you don't know?
[time=3336] Shape up.
[time=3336] What come you're crying?
[time=3337] I don't know why I'm crying.
[time=3339] Every husband knows that.
[time=3340] They cry because it's just something to do.
[time=3342] We just cry.
[time=3346] And now sometimes, she has a great heart of compassion.
[time=3348] She can cry.
[time=3349] One of the first cries, she cries.
[time=3353] When they're in tears, she's in tears.
[time=3354] And I said, oh, God, give me those kinds of tears.
[time=3357] And when somebody else cries, I can cry with them real genuine tears.
[time=3362] I want to feel the pain that they feel.
[time=3365] And blessed be God when that happens in our lives.
[time=3369] So sensitive to the needs of people, we can cry with them.
[time=3372] It's going to hurt.
[time=3377] But don't be afraid.
[time=3379] Don't be afraid to hurt.
[time=3383] You're going to get hurt.
[time=3383] You're going to have your heart broken.
[time=3386] Your life may turn.
[time=3386] It may not all be peaches and cream.
[time=3388] It won't be one big party through life.
[time=3390] You're going to be going through times of deep, deep pain, and sometimes even depression because of the lives of other people.
[time=3397] But that's OK.
[time=3398] That's part of compassion.
[time=3401] That's real humanity.
[time=3403] That's real Christianity.
[time=3404] That's a real person of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3408] Friends, let yourself hurt.
[time=3411] Let yourself weep.
[time=3413] Let yourself at night go to bed with tears and make and drown yourself in your tears at night, not for your own problems, but for the problems of other people.
[time=3423] I can recall coming home many times, coming home and feeling depressed.
[time=3428] One particular night, coming home and grabbing my pillow and saying, in tears, oh, honey, they just do not listen.
[time=3435] They just do not listen.
[time=3438] And she reaching over and stroking my head and saying, that's OK, honey.
[time=3443] We still got to keep preaching to them.
[time=3447] [MUSIC]
[time=3450] All our special thanks to our sanctuary choir
[time=3459] and orchestra and Scott Schindler and Marilyn Wong for a marvelous spiritual experience in all of the music that we had today.
[time=3467] The message was from our special guest, Alex Montoya, who is from California, has been here for the weekend.
[time=3473] And we're just thankful for his ministry with us today.
[time=3476] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I'm going to take just a minute and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3483] Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3486] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you and tell you that I need Christ as my Savior.
[time=3492] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3497] In Jesus' name, I pray, amen.
[time=3501] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3505] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance," to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
