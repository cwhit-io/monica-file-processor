[time=0] So, better than demon possessed would be demonized.
[time=5] Indicating that a demon has taken up residence inside the body of an individual, and its
[time=11] energy or activity throws the individual into a passive state and the demon is now in control.
[time=29] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=35] Thank you for joining us.
[time=37] Just what can Satan and demons do to a believer?
[time=40] Can a believer be demon possessed?
[time=42] What does it mean to be demon oppressed?
[time=44] Stay tuned today as Pastor Moore looks to God's word for answers to these questions.
[time=49] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it ready for today's message.
[time=53] We'll be looking at several different passages.
[time=56] Our special music today will feature the sanctuary choir, the hand-billed choir, and
[time=67] Becky Woolman.
[time=70] Let's now join our service.
[time=86] [MUSIC - 312 seconds]
[time=426] As you're watching the Bible hour today, I hope you catch the excitement and enthusiasm we have here in our worship center as we worship God together. I just rustled and so pleased and looked forward to Sunday morning and seeing all of our people come together and knowing that they love the Lord and we're in this place together serving Him.
[time=445] I feel the exact same way. In fact, sometimes when I get up there, I want to ask everybody to just shout Hallelujah or praise the Lord because the sense of excitement and the common vision and to study the Word of God and sing His praises and to know we're redeemed and forgiven for our sins and that this is really just a small picture of what glory will be like forever that you sometimes it's overwhelming.
[time=467] I know that some of you can't are unable to leave your home and that's why we bring the Bible hour to you, but I hope that you just have that same sense of excitement in your heart for the Lord as you watch and you join in with us in our worship service here.
[time=482] We're continuing with our new building. Russell, just the other day, I heard some rumbling right next to the wall in my office and I looked out and they were preparing the floor for the orchestra room. The walls are up for our new classrooms.
[time=495] The gymnasium is up and the roof is on the gym and we're just seeing great progress. I think even next week we'll show our people some of the progress through videotape.
[time=504] Well it's all starting to happen so fast and I guess you reach a certain point in a project where suddenly you begin to really see what it is they've set their heart to build and it's exciting.
[time=515] There's so much more space and so many opportunities to train and equip people that I think our whole church is starting to really catch on to that.
[time=523] That's great and also we don't want to neglect the fact that while we're building buildings that we're still working on the lives of our own people and we're stressing not only the staff getting involved with individual people that have need but our own lay people getting out in the workplace and helping other people with their problems
[time=539] and we've had some good progress in the last week. We've had some very exciting reports and from people. Every Wednesday night teams from our church will go out into the community and that's by appointment, by invitation
[time=552] and as they have opportunity to share the gospel. And in the last two weeks five different people have prayed to receive Christ and those teams are now looking to disciple them and encourage them in their growth.
[time=565] And then I got a letter just this morning as a matter of fact from a lady in our church who volunteers at the crisis pregnancy center here in town.
[time=574] First our church supports that ministry and our missions budget were excited about it but one of the young gals that came in who took a pregnancy test and thankfully it turned up negative.
[time=586] A junior in high school and it was expressing how lonely she feels and how difficult life is for her and one of the members of our church has shared about the unconditional love of God and that coming through Christ and all the rest.
[time=600] So this young gal prayed to receive Christ right on the spot and now our family member here is trying to disciple her and grow her up in the Lord.
[time=609] So we praise the Lord for that and many of our people are going to be involved in the life chain this afternoon downtown and we're just thankful for individuals in our church that see their responsibility to help disciple and encourage other people that they know.
[time=625] We hope that's true in your life too if you're a Christian that you'll reach out to someone even this week.
[time=631] We want to tell you about the cassette we've talked about it for a couple weeks it'll be a few weeks yet before it's completed but we have about seven singers who have recorded special numbers for this.
[time=641] We're going to have ten soloists sing on this Bible Hour cassette and you can receive it by asking for it and sending a donation of ten dollars or more to help the Bible Hour in its expenses.
[time=652] You can receive this cassette by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=663] Let's go back now to the main portion of our service with more music and the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=673] There is much confusion in the world today.
[time=694] Peace has turned to fighting and love has turned to hate. This is not what God intended. This is not what he had planned.
[time=711] Things are very different now than when we first began. We say God is our father and we say we trust in him.
[time=726] We have left his ways for our ways and fallen into sin yet we claim to seek forgiveness and we say we'll follow him but God would not have led us to this place where we now live.
[time=749] The only hope for the world is Jesus the only help for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=763] Oh how we need him we must seek him with all of our heart and all our soul. There is no other help we know than Jesus Christ the only hope for the world.
[time=788] Oh it's time for all of the people to call upon the Lord and pray to God almighty to touch and heal our world so if every heart would be humbled and each soul would turn to God
[time=810] then love would reign in every heart and love would be enough. The only hope for the world is Jesus the only help for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=832] Oh how we need him we must seek him with all of our heart and all our soul. There is no other help we know than Jesus Christ the only hope for the world.
[time=855] The only peace is the Prince of Peace moving in our hearts today and the only good news is the good news that Jesus is the way.
[time=872] The only hope for the world is Jesus the only help for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=887] Oh how we need him we must seek him with all of our heart and all our soul. There is no other help we know than Jesus Christ the only hope for the world.
[time=909] We must seek him there is no other help we know than Jesus Christ.
[time=925] The only hope for the world.
[time=945] Amen Becky thank you so much had a chance to visit with Becky's dad last week as I was over at Grace Theological Seminary speaking there
[time=954] to the seminarians of course her dad has been a great scholar in that school and a leader for many many years and he's ministered in our pulpit
[time=962] and I'm so thankful for the faith that he passed on to Becky and Gary and that they're passing on to their kids as we continue to build the kingdom together.
[time=971] Well if you have your Bibles let me encourage you to take them this morning and open to Ephesians chapter 6 Ephesians chapter 6.
[time=980] We're in a series and we're studying Satan demons and spiritual warfare this will be our third message in the series that began with a message on Satan who is he and what is his agenda.
[time=994] We went from there to a message on demons and focused in particularly on what they could do in the life of an unbeliever and this morning we'll discuss what demons can do in the life of a Christian.
[time=1007] What demons can do in the life of those who are truly born again and what our resources are in Christ to stand against that.
[time=1017] And as you'll notice we've included some notes in your bulletin today there's a great amount of information that comes under this topic.
[time=1025] You can see from those notes there are two basic questions we'll try to answer can a believer be demon possessed that's on the front of your notes on the back of your notes you'll notice the question can a believer be demon oppressed.
[time=1040] So we'll give our attention to that this morning can a believer be demon possessed.
[time=1046] Let me begin by talking about the notion of demon possession you can find it translated that way in Matthew 828 talking about two men who were quote unquote demon possessed.
[time=1057] Matthew 932 records a demon possessed person Matthew 1222 the same phrase demon possessed is used it's probably not the best translation because demon possession implies ownership.
[time=1073] It's as if whether the believer in view or the unbeliever in view it's as if the demon moves in and habits the individual and then possesses them and owns them.
[time=1082] The Bible does not think or categorize or talk or discuss demons as owning anything.
[time=1089] They have at best delegated authority from the prince of the power of the air Satan himself they are viewed rather as squatters on the earth using delegated authority from the prince of the power of the air.
[time=1101] So demon possession and I may that may come out of my mouth from time to time because it's been in my head so many years.
[time=1107] But what I'll mean by that rather is demonization to be demonized.
[time=1112] The Greek word really has three parts to it the first is demon and that would indicate the influence of demons.
[time=1119] Then a causative stem I see demon is and that would be the active source of energy there.
[time=1126] So it is a demon that is active and then a passive ending ominous O M E N O S which means the person in whom the demon is active becomes passive.
[time=1137] The demon is in control so demonization is really a better word and as I say you'll probably hear me interchange that with possession.
[time=1146] But understand that as demonization not ownership but a demon inside of an individual exercising its power thereby making the person passive.
[time=1157] And we looked at examples of that in our previous message on what the demons can do to unbelievers.
[time=1164] The question is can that happen to a believer? Can a person who is born again regenerated by the Spirit of God and dwelt by the Spirit of God baptized into the body of Christ Christ in you the hope of glory?
[time=1178] Can such a person have a demon inside of them and that demon capable of making them passive out of control?
[time=1186] And I guess if we were raising this question 30 years ago there would be very little for me to say on the topic.
[time=1192] You could have then gone to your local Christian bookstore and found nothing on the topic.
[time=1198] You'd have been lucky if you'd found a book on demon possession in the unbeliever much less a book on demon possession in the believer but in the last 20 years that has changed dramatically.
[time=1209] The snowball effect began with a man by the name of Mark Bubeck who wrote two books won the adversary in 1975 and followed that up with overcoming the adversary in 1984.
[time=1221] In his books he postulates the notion that the born again believer can be demonized or demon possessed or controlled by a demon that indwells the believer.
[time=1232] If you were to read those books you'd find that his postulation or his theories or his argument are based more on his own personal experience with people who are demon possessed claiming to be Christians than the word of God itself.
[time=1247] But following after that author another man C. Fred Dickerson a well-known author.
[time=1253] In fact I studied one of his books in seminary called Angels, Elect and Evil.
[time=1257] It was kind of the basic standard text on angels and demons when I was going through seminary.
[time=1263] After that more traditional book he has since written in 1987 a book called Demon Possession and the Christian.
[time=1271] He backs up Bubeck's notion that a true born again believer can be demonized, can be made passive under the power of an indwelling demon.
[time=1283] Now it's interesting to note that C. Fred Dickerson is a mainline evangelical professor in a mainline evangelical school college namely Moody Bible Institute.
[time=1296] After his second word demon possession and the Christian then in the late 80's Frank Paredy came out with his this present darkness and piercing the darkness which by his own admission is a fanciful fantasy of fiction about demons and spiritual warfare.
[time=1313] He nowhere makes the claim to be biblical it is pure fiction and in reading his first book I haven't taken time to read his second.
[time=1322] I also was encouraged as I'm sure many of you were by the reminder that there is a spiritual battle going on there is more than meets the eye when it comes to our church and to living the Christian battle.
[time=1333] I have been encouraged by his book to pray more fervently for the cause of Christ and all the rest and I certainly appreciate his talent as an author.
[time=1341] My concern however comes and I would stand as a reminder to you today not to build your theology about demons and spiritual warfare on his fiction which is often what happens.
[time=1354] Fiction whether it be in the second or movie or whether it be in by a Christian author about Christian topics can come into our brain as fiction and then we leave the book behind and principles and certain things begin to assume the place of fact or worse biblical authority.
[time=1372] It goes from there to the early 90s and there are probably eight or nine new books that are on the market today that you could go by at a basic Christian bookstore and I'm not faulting the bookstore for this I'm just saying how available and how main line it is.
[time=1386] Authors who are non charismatic who are non pentecostal evangelical authors who would again postulate and argue for the fact that believers can be demonized.
[time=1397] Not just in dwelt but made passive and I want to stress that what these authors are going to say is that this demon inside of you can keep you from obeying the word of God.
[time=1409] Truly it could be said the devil made me do it or a demon made me do it. Let me illustrate in C. Fred Dickison's book possession demon possession in the Christian.
[time=1419] He says in his book that he estimates from 1975 to 1987 he has dealt with 400 cases of true genuine believers who have been demonized and dwelt by demons and made passive by the power of those demons.
[time=1438] And he lists in his book eight cases. Let me just review them for you briefly. The first was a Christian nurse who was struggling with lustful thoughts.
[time=1448] After typical Christian biblical counseling had run its course she still struggled with lustful thoughts.
[time=1454] So she went to see Dickison who involved himself in his with her special demon type counseling determined that in fact she was inhabited by a demon cast the demon out and so her problem was resolved.
[time=1468] The second case he cites as a man who wanted to be a woman. Strong desire in this man to be a different sex after the traditional Christian counseling had run its course again.
[time=1478] It was not until the demon was discovered identified and cast out that the man was free of his desire to be a woman.
[time=1485] The third case was of a woman who was mentally and sexually harassed from an unseen force when lying in her own bed at night.
[time=1494] The same thing ran its course and finally the demon was taken out and she was fine. The fourth case was a gal who could not concentrate on her theology class studies.
[time=1506] Whenever she would study in particular her theology notes or her theology books she could not concentrate and in fact when she was in the classroom taking exams in that theology class she almost blanked out.
[time=1520] The fifth case is of a pastor who was demon possessed because ancestral spirits found their way into his family tree had taken advantage through their occult practices to enter into their family line.
[time=1533] The sixth case was a pastor in Colorado who came under attack at 3 a.m. for many weeks that same time every morning.
[time=1541] After having been examined it was determined that there were no demons in him that was not the case. In fact the real culprit was his wife who was demon possessed.
[time=1550] Some of you are finding this to sound a little familiar this no.
[time=1553] Who was demon possessed and in her the demon would come out of her.
[time=1558] How do you know that the demon did this well?
[time=1560] Dickerson questioned the demon inside of her and the demon admitted to having come out of her body every morning at 3 a.m.
[time=1567] To harass this pastor to make him less effective in his ministry for the cause of Christ the demon was dealt with and the harassment stopped.
[time=1576] Cases seven and eight that he lists are of two missionary women from totally different places on the planet doing their missionary work who almost simultaneously became incapacitated in their ministry and were led into deceitful and destructive ways sinful ways and their mission boards were just about ready to defrock them
[time=1595] and take them out of the mission field when they finally found their way to Dickerson who counseled them and determined and found that there were demons in them and cast the demons out and the ladies were to return them to normal productive healthy missionary experience.
[time=1611] The key point I want you to catch in all of this is that normal Christianity was not working.
[time=1617] Normal understanding of the word of God and repentance and obedience and accountability and worship and service and the ministry of spiritual gifts and living for other people was not sufficient to overcome the sin that plagued these individual people.
[time=1632] The solution was found in identifying the demon and expelling the demon.
[time=1637] Let me go a little bit more into detail on one of the cases the gal I mentioned who or that he mentioned that was having difficulty studying the theology texts and would almost pass out in the theology exams.
[time=1648] She came to him for counseling and he was able to contact the demon inside of her.
[time=1655] The demon reported that he was in her life because her ancestors had long ago but involved in occult and demonic activity.
[time=1663] That was why they felt so free to have sway in her body and her life.
[time=1669] In these counseling sessions she was asked to share her testimony which she began to do but she had to break it off.
[time=1676] She couldn't finish her testimony because the demon inside of her caused great pain and she went into convulsive reactions and later explained the pain similar to what she might imagine being shocked with electricity.
[time=1689] While confronting the demon for its name and apparently this is a very important thing to do you must find out the name of the demon.
[time=1697] The demon was very elusive and would not answer the question.
[time=1700] And so the counselor knowing that this woman was a believer prayed to Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory who was in her body and requested of Jesus to put pressure on the demon so that the demon could not take evasive action to his questions.
[time=1714] After this prayer shortly after this prayer the voice inside this girl was reported to say oh no no no no no no Jesus get away get away get away.
[time=1727] So apparently Jesus was responding to the request of the counselor.
[time=1731] Finally the demon gave his name confusion confusion was the name and he said that when Jesus and daddy agreed he would leave and not before.
[time=1743] Confusion also revealed that he was of the rank of throne and you'll read in Colossians the various ranks of the demonic forces and confusion identified himself to be of the rank of throne.
[time=1755] When she was prepared then to denounce or renounce this demon from her life she began to say those words to get him out of her life or whatever word she was instructed to say and the demon reportedly choked her so that she could not complete her sentences.
[time=1770] And so the counselor got a tape deck put a Christian tape in it which had Christian words on the song and played it in the presence of the woman and her attendant demon and that apparently was sufficient to back the demon off.
[time=1783] The demon was then expelled by her agreeing with Jesus that he shouldn't be there the process was a body wrenching experience and she was finally freed of confusion and his underlings.
[time=1795] Now I quote as a result of all this in this man's book the result the results with daddy were noticeable.
[time=1802] She was no longer confused in many areas of her life.
[time=1806] She was able to think clearly about herself and her relationships and she was able to take her tests without confusion and to raise her grades in a Christian graduate school.
[time=1819] I sure wish somebody would have helped me with that. It would have improved my GPA. She continues to walk with the Lord but without so much distraction.
[time=1828] Some spirits still remain at this writing but we sense they soon will all be sent to where Jesus sends them the pit in quote.
[time=1839] Non-penicostal, non-charismatic, mainline evangelical. There's a host of books on the market today that you could read and be convinced by this type of problem in your life.
[time=1851] What should we be expecting? What is our role? What does the Bible say to us? Are we to be binding Satan?
[time=1859] Are we to be in the deliverance ministry delivering Christians from the demonization?
[time=1867] Should we be concerned that we are plagued by demons who found their way into our bodies through ancestral worship in the occult?
[time=1879] Are we to believe that there are territorial demons? Some would suggest that these territorial demons are located like we would have certain Fort Wayne demons.
[time=1889] There's a whole host of these that have been assigned and they hover over and do damage in the city of Fort Wayne and maybe even more specifically in the area of Blackhawk and maybe even more specifically to this church and maybe even more specifically to the elders of this church and me in this church.
[time=1907] This is their area. This is their domain. This is what they do and we will not be successful or as successful as God would have us until we deal with these demons in very particular ways.
[time=1920] So I hope that sets the scene for what I now want to say about what the Bible says about demons and the believer.
[time=1927] And let's begin by examining our database. Look at your notes. You see there under question number one, can a believer be demon possessed?
[time=1935] And I break it into four categories. What the Old Testament says about it? There are four particular incidents of demonization in the Old Testament. That's it.
[time=1944] Under the Gospels, there are eight particular incidents and you see those listed.
[time=1949] In the book of Acts, there are two particular incidents and then in the Epistles and Revelation, speaking of the New Testament church, before the end of the age and all that goes on there, there are no examples of believers in the church being demonized.
[time=1966] So first of all, realize that adds up to 14 cases. There are 14 cases from the beginning of time to the end of the age where we have an opportunity to look at someone being demonized.
[time=1978] And I suggest you get a very small database from which to write and to pin and to develop doctrines and theology and all the rest about demonization.
[time=1988] But maybe more importantly, you will not find in any of those 14 cases a clear cut example of a believer being demon possessed.
[time=1998] Search the Bible as you will, all to New Testament, you will not find a faithful or genuine believer in the record of Scripture who is demonized, who is indwelt by a demon.
[time=2009] There are only two questionable texts out of the 14. The first would be Saul. Some would assume Saul to have been a true believer. He is called the anointed one eight times, which leads many to believe that he was a genuine believer.
[time=2022] There are some who really question that, but even giving that point, even saying that he was a true believer, you'll notice in that text you don't need to turn there, but in 1 Samuel 19, it says, now there was an evil spirit from the Lord on Saul, not in Saul.
[time=2038] So even if we grant him to be a believer, it doesn't hold up, it wouldn't be demon and dwelt.
[time=2044] The other questionable passage is Luke 13, number eight there under the gospels. This talks about that dear woman who had been bent over by demon possession. She was unable to straighten her body up. There's no question she was demon possessed.
[time=2057] The only question is was she a believer while she was demon and dwelt. The answer is no. There's no evidence to that. She is in the text called a daughter of Abraham, which some want to say then, well that's obvious, daughter of Abraham, she was a true believer.
[time=2069] It doesn't mean she was a believer at all. It means she was a Jewess, and it means that she looked to Abraham for her national identity.
[time=2076] That's it. That's all there is. That's all we can look at. That's all the data we have to look at in the entire Word of God about being demonized by way of the Lord giving us examples of such.
[time=2090] So let me draw some principles from it. I have about five of them here. Number one, as I've said, not one clear example in all of scripture where a believer was inhabited by a demon.
[time=2101] Number two, there is not one clear example in all of scripture where a demon was cast out, exercised or expelled from a true believer. It's not there.
[time=2113] Number three, there is no passage or even a verse of instruction given to the leadership of the church or to the saints at large as to how to diagnose demonization.
[time=2128] In other words, we are without any counsel from the Word of God as leadership or as laity as to how to look at a professing believer and diagnose whether or not there's a demon in there that will just help us.
[time=2141] Number four, there is no passage or verse commanding believers or instructing believers how to cast a demon out.
[time=2153] How to get a demon out of a fellow believer. We are nowhere commanded to do that. And secondly, we have been given no instructions as to how to do that.
[time=2163] Fifth, and we'll rest on 2 Timothy 3, 16. You remember those familiar verses? All scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness that the man of God may be adequate and equipped for every good deed.
[time=2179] The Word of God claims that it is sufficient to train up the believer in righteousness. Everything we need is here. Everything we need to grow in the cause of Christ is in the Word of God.
[time=2190] Now think with me. If it is true that a demon can get inside of a believer and exercise its power over that believer making it passive, not able to control its own life, causing it to have lustful thoughts, causing it to fall into complacency or despondency or despair or lethargy or lack of energy to do the work that God would have it do, whether it's in the workplace or in the church.
[time=2216] Whether it's some type of a seducing spirit that could cause the believer outside the believer's power to involve itself and in godly activity. If that's true, then the Word of God is not sufficient because there is nothing in the Word of God as we have said to diagnose it.
[time=2236] We have no instruction to cast them out. We have no instruction as to how to cast them out and we would be laid helpless at the hands of an indwelling demon possibly from an ancestral problem with witchcraft.
[time=2247] Then we'll languish under that problem with an inability to obey the Word of God because we're out of control.
[time=2255] So you ask me, can a believer be demon possessed? I say no. And when you add to that the force of other passages in Scripture like Romans 8, 37, we are overwhelmingly conquerors through Christ.
[time=2267] 1 Corinthians 15, 57, God gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 2 Corinthians 2, 14, God always leads us in His triumph in Christ.
[time=2278] 1 John 2, 13 and 14, we have overcome the evil one and 1 John 4, 4, greater is He who is in us than He who is in the world.
[time=2288] To me it seems obvious that that is not what God wants us to understand about what demons can do to the believer, to get inside of us and make us passive and unable to obey the clear commands of the Word of God.
[time=2304] Christ defeated and judged Satan by His redemptive death and resurrection. Christ is exalted above all powers and we are in His care and He is our defense.
[time=2316] We heard him pray in the High Priestly Prayer in John 17 to protect us from the evil one. He prayed the same for Peter and he now intercedes for us in our defense against Satan.
[time=2328] And his prayers I might add are always answered. So there is no biblical support but let me go a little bit further.
[time=2336] Let's talk about some key buzz phrases that if you're listening to contemporary Christian radio depending on which station you're listening to or you're reading some of these books you're going to maybe be a little confused about.
[time=2347] They're right here, these four issues, binding Satan, deliverance, generational bondage and territorial demons.
[time=2354] What does the Bible say? Are we to be involved in prayers that are binding Satan and you can, by the way, can buy books that will teach you how to pray in such a way as to bind Satan.
[time=2365] Whether you would bind his activity over the city of Fort Wayne, whether you would bind his activity in somebody's life that you love, a family member or your own life and you get involved in these prayers which rightly so depending upon the Spirit of God and depending upon Christ Himself not on your own authority
[time=2382] but on the authority given to the Christian maybe through the Great Commission, Matthew 28, there is the prayer to bind Satan. Is there any biblical support for that?
[time=2391] Well the only four places in all the Bible where this notion is brought up are listed before you. The first is Matthew 12, 22 to 29 and there is absolutely no connection there with a believer praying to bind Satan.
[time=2406] The second, excuse me, is Matthew 16 and again those are instructions given to the apostles and they have no bearing on you and I, you and me as believers in the New Testament church.
[time=2420] The third context is Matthew 18 and there it's church discipline. Whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. It has nothing to do with demons.
[time=2429] And Revelation 20 verses 1 through 3 is at the end of the age and you'd have to be an Amalennialist to believe that that applies to you. That's a great angel binding Satan. It has nothing to do with the believer.
[time=2441] So in all the word of God there is absolutely no precedence, no support, no indication that you and I should be involved in prayers that are attempting to bind Satan. Think of the prayers of Paul, did you ever hear him pray that?
[time=2456] Think of the prayers of Christ other than the reference in the High Priestly Prayer, John 17 that he would protect us from the evil one. You don't even hear Paul or hear Jesus praying to Satan or talking to Satan in prayer.
[time=2469] All of their prayer life, all of their focus is on God and praying to God about the things of God.
[time=2476] Never is the focus of prayer or the communication in prayer turned to Satan or his demons.
[time=2483] Secondly, what about deliverance? You'll hear people saying that this sin was in their life until they were delivered by a demon, whether the demon was inside or out on top or somewhere else in this believer's life.
[time=2496] So people have ministries, deliverance ministries. What does the Bible say about that? Look at the three basic categories. Yes, I believe we should be in the deliverance ministry, but it's defined as bringing people to Christ.
[time=2512] You notice I cite there, Colossians 1, 13, let me read it to you, for he, namely Jesus, delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son.
[time=2524] You want to be involved in delivering people from the kingdom of darkness and from Satan and from demons, share the gospel with them. That's how you deliver people.
[time=2532] Galatians 1, 4, Hebrews 2, 14 through 15 would say the same, it's the same basic reality.
[time=2540] Secondly, you'll notice there for Christians by God.
[time=2545] And the two references there of being delivered are Matthew 6, 13, where the Lord teaches his disciples to pray, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
[time=2556] And if you want a lengthy understanding of that, come back two Sunday nights from today, we're preaching through the disciples' prayer in the evening services and we're coming up to that particular text and we'll be there in two weeks.
[time=2568] So we'll give you a greater understanding of that. Go over to 2 Timothy 4, 18 for a minute, and you'll see there the deliverance being spoken of.
[time=2579] 2 Timothy 4, 18.
[time=2583] And of course Paul is writing, "The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed that will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom to him be the glory forever and ever."
[time=2595] Satan is not in view, being delivered from Satan is not what's in question, it's being delivered from every evil deed.
[time=2603] So one, under the deliverance ministry, it's for unbelievers through salvation.
[time=2608] Secondly, it's for Christians by God, not from demons, but from evil, or evil deeds.
[time=2614] And then thirdly, this is very interesting, look at this.
[time=2617] For professing believers to Satan, come with me over to 1 Corinthians for a second.
[time=2626] 1 Corinthians 5, 5.
[time=2633] 1 Corinthians 5, 5. Paul says, "I have decided to deliver one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
[time=2646] Jesus Christ." What's going on here? This is the incest man, this is the man who has chosen to have sex with his father's wife, probably a second wife.
[time=2657] And he is persistent in this, he is refusing to repent, he has been talked to by the church, he's been talked to by Paul, he's been called into accountability, and he refuses to change.
[time=2667] In other words, normal, traditional, Christian understanding of sin has been brought to bear on his life. What happens next?
[time=2675] Do they get him together in some room with some spiritual guru and involve themselves in delivering him from the power of a demon that resides within him and makes him passive so he involves in this incest against his will?
[time=2690] That's not at all what happens, it's the exact opposite. Paul says there, verse 5, "I have decided to deliver him, I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=2706] It's not a deliverance from a demon, it's a deliverance over to the power of Satan so that he can see the full depravity and destruction of his own choices and his sinfulness, and hopefully having seen that, having allowed his sin to work its full course in his own life, his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2724] You remember the same thing was true of Hymenaeus and Alexander in 1 Timothy 1 verse 20. These were men who were preaching these demon doctrines that we talked about in that study, and they had worked their way into leadership in the church, they were clearly contradicting the gospel and the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ preaching on and on and on. Paul had confronted them, Paul had sent Timothy to confront him, Paul had now written a letter about them, exposing them, and finally Paul says, "I have delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander over to him."
[time=2753] Alexander over to Satan that they may be taught not to blaspheme.
[time=2758] So in other words, what the Bible teaches us about a deliverance ministry is almost exactly opposite of what the contemporary theme is saying.
[time=2768] The contemporary picture is to find the fault and the error and the inability to obey the Word of God on a demon that is in you, and your ultimate solution comes when someone has the skill and the ingenuity to cast the thing out.
[time=2782] Then you can obey. The Word of God says the opposite, obey the Word of God. If you don't obey the Word of God, it's not you've got a demon in you, we're going to give you over.
[time=2790] In the process of Matthew 18 to treat you like a Gentile and a tax gather to put you outside the protective blessings of the church and there find the full expression of your sin that your spirit may be saved in the end.
[time=2806] Look now at generational bondage, generational bondage, and you've heard me refer to that on several different occasions through and in all of this.
[time=2817] But it's the notion that somehow my ancestors are the ones who open the door to demon activity and having gone through that door, they stay in the corridor of our family tree until finally they come into me.
[time=2831] There are only three passages in all the Old Testament that give any hint of that kind of involvement. Deuteronomy 5, 9 would be the one that would be often looked to.
[time=2843] It says there that God is visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation.
[time=2851] Now that's not talking about demons, that's not talking about demon possession. That's saying that when the father and his household and his family diverts from worshiping the true and living God and lives in sin, that effect stays with that family.
[time=2868] That effect is not wiped out in the very next generation. The character deficiencies, the warped worldview, the sinful self-consuming way of life is caught by the next generation, it's passed to the next generation, it's passed to the next generation, that just doesn't just dilute itself immediately, that stuff is passed on.
[time=2887] It's also a reference to working under the conditional covenant of the Old Testament where God said if you'll obey me, I'll bless you and if you disobey me, I'll curse you.
[time=2895] And when the father would disobey God, God would curse them and their land and he would take their flocks and he would bring enemy armies that would often take possession of a land for several decades, sometimes as long as a hundred years.
[time=2907] And it would be the children, not the fathers, who would suffer the punishment and the chastisement of a previous generation's wrongdoing.
[time=2916] But somehow out of these very brief scriptures, which do not have demonization and view, the contemporary movement in this area finds strength now to write an entire doctrine and an entire theology that believers can in fact be demonized.
[time=2932] Territorial demons, I've mentioned that to you already, there are some, as I've said, who believe that unless we get a grip on understanding the territorial demons of Fort Wayne and Black Hawk and this church, and we begin to pray against them and bind them and deliver them from the membership of this church, we will never know full joy and full experience of the gospel in our fellowship.
[time=2957] Now they take that, the only hint of territorial demons in the Bible is Daniel chapter 10.
[time=2963] It's an exciting passage to read that talks about Daniel being on his knees in prayer and he says, "Behold, a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees."
[time=2976] And he said to me, "Oh Daniel, man of high esteem, understanding the words that I am about to tell you and stand upright, for I have now been sent to you."
[time=2986] This is an angel taking the form of a human and it's touching the shoulder of Daniel and he instructs Daniel to stand up and listen.
[time=2996] And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood up trembling.
[time=2999] Then he said to me, "Do not be afraid Daniel, for from the first day that you set your heart on understanding this and on humbling yourself before your God, he was seeking to understand the prophecy that he was reading from a previous writer.
[time=3013] Your words were heard and I have come in response to your words." Well, that was 21 days ago.
[time=3021] What took the angel so long?
[time=3023] Verse 13, "But the prince of the kingdom of Persia was withstanding me for 21 days."
[time=3031] In other words, a glimpse behind the scenes of physical reality, the spiritual forces of wickedness in Ephesians 6, Daniel is praying.
[time=3041] God knows it. God wants to answer it. God chooses to answer it through an angel, a messenger.
[time=3046] But the messenger can't even get to Daniel's proximity for 21 days because the prince of the kingdom of Persia, obviously a demonic angel is standing in his way.
[time=3058] Help came and Michael.
[time=3060] Then behold, Michael, one of the chief princes came to help me for I had been left there with the kings of Persia.
[time=3069] That's it. That's all of it. Now, maybe down in verses 20 or rather 20 and 21, you'll see another reference to this prince of Persia.
[time=3080] But that's the full extent. That's the beginning and the end of what the Bible says about territorial demons.
[time=3087] But out of that, you'll read people, whether in fiction or read people trying to espouse some doctrine or theology that says that these demons have possession.
[time=3095] They're assigned there. They've been there for centuries. Occasionally they can be reassigned by Satan from one area of the world to another area of the world depending upon what God is doing with his angels.
[time=3104] And it's just, it's great reading.
[time=3106] I'm just not sure that it's something you want to believe as truth.
[time=3110] I believe we build our truth and understanding about demons and angels from the Word of God, not other sources.
[time=3118] So binding Satan, deliverance, generational bondage, and territorial demons. Now, let me sum it up this way.
[time=3128] Can the demon or is can the believer be demonized and dwelt by a demon and made passive by that demon?
[time=3136] I'm saying no. Why? One, not one clear example of Christian demonization in all the Bible.
[time=3147] From the beginning of time to the end of the age. Two, not one clear example of a Christian having had a demon cast out of them.
[time=3158] Three, no warning anywhere in the Word of God that the believer could be so demonized.
[time=3167] Four, no instruction in all the Word of God as to diagnosing or casting out a demon.
[time=3177] Now, you think, wait a minute. What about all those cases and acts?
[time=3181] I mean, we saw Jesus doing that. We saw the apostles do that. We saw some of his disciples do that. We even saw one of the disciples couldn't do that.
[time=3188] Let me say this to you. When you read these case studies and you hear these individuals, these counselors identifying demons and gathering their name and learning about the history of the ancestral tradition and learning from them that a key phrase, unless the girl and Jesus agree together,
[time=3210] they will never come out. When you learn all about the ranks and which demon is in which rank and when you learn all about from the demon-possessed person
[time=3220] and asking these questions about territorial demons and that they have areas and that they're moving here and moving there.
[time=3227] I want to remind you, do you know where all of that information is coming from?
[time=3232] Even if it's real demon possession in an unbeliever, do you know where it's coming from?
[time=3236] A demon. If there's anything we know about Satan and demons, it's what?
[time=3242] They're liars. They are deceivers.
[time=3247] In other words, this whole movement, this whole way of dealing with demons, whether believers or unbelievers, the whole scope of what they do behind closed doors in their counseling room is basically built upon a few examples in the book of Acts,
[time=3262] but beyond that, for the specificity of deliverance and generational bondage and territorial demon, all that stuff is their collective understanding of what they have learned from the source of deception itself, demons and Satan.
[time=3276] Count me out. I want nothing to do with it. Why in the world would I believe them?
[time=3284] So it just blows my mind. No instruction in the Word of God as to diagnosing or to casting out a demon from a believer.
[time=3293] Number five, if demon possession or demonization, if it really could cause passivity in the believer, overpowering that believer's will and then their obligation to obey the Word of God,
[time=3312] there is a major chink in the Word of God and in the armor of the believer.
[time=3318] What we're saying is that it's not our fault. It's a demon's fault. That's in me that makes me passive.
[time=3325] That is foreign to all New Testament thought.
[time=3330] Read any passage in the New Testament about the believer and his sin, and you'll come to the same conclusion.
[time=3336] When a believer sins, who's responsible? The believer. Who's responsible to repent? The believer.
[time=3344] Who's responsible to start off and pursue God again? The believer. It begins and it ends with the believer.
[time=3351] But if demonization is a reality, then there's a whole other category in a way in which the believer is not responsible anymore for his behavior and then a whole category of working with that believer for which we have no divine, inspired instruction.
[time=3365] We're left then to lean on what we could gather through counseling sessions with the demon possessed.
[time=3374] So, I don't think you can be demon possessed as a believer. I don't think you can be demonized as a believer.
[time=3382] Now you notice on the back of your page, can a believer be demon oppressed?
[time=3388] The answer to that is yes, and there are several examples of that in the Word of God.
[time=3394] And in the interest of time, we will promise to come back next week, Lord willing, and finish our time with you on this incredible topic.
[time=3403] Thank you for your attention. Let's pray together.
[time=3405] I'm glad that we had the privilege once again to present music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Becky Wollman and our handbell choir.
