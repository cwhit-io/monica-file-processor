[time=135] How is he?
[time=165] To the god of my craziness.
[time=169] Oh my, how they shine.

[time=179] To the god of my craziness.
[time=182] I know we don't.
[time=185] I'm singing.
[time=190] To the god of my craziness.
[time=454] To the cross they carried him.
[time=457] With all our guilt and all our sin.
[time=461] The Lamb of God was slain for our transgressions.
[time=468] And on that cross those nail pierced hands.
[time=473] He reached up to God and down to man.
[time=476] And just as if I'd never sin.
[time=480] He took me in his arms.
[time=484] Embracing me here willingly forgave.
[time=495] Oh, mercy, grace, and love that knows no bounds.
[time=503] Though guilty and dead, I've known three.
[time=509] For ever I'll forgive it.
[time=513] For Christ the Lord has risen.
[time=517] And with him we shall all one day be.
[time=527] Oh, I'll end you.
[time=531] We'll raise the bell.
[time=535] I'll end you.

[time=870] Be with in my heart I feel it when I call to my heart I feel it when I call to me.
[time=970] Thank you Bill and Scott.
[time=979] If you have your Bibles with you this morning I'll ask you to take them and open to Ephesians 6, Ephesians 6.
[time=988] And if you're visiting with us today or you haven't been in church for a little while, we are in a series on Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare.
[time=998] And today we've had a message on Satan, who he is and what his agenda is.
[time=1004] We went from there to a message on demons and the unbeliever and looked at the various ways in which they assault and mislead the unbelieving world.
[time=1014] Last week we discussed really the first part of demons and the believer.
[time=1020] What can demons do to the person who was born again, the believer in Christ? And we really centered on the topic where the question can a believer be demon possessed or indwelled and controlled by a demon?
[time=1033] And if you've missed that message and you're interested in what we concluded as from the evidence of the word of God I'd encourage you to just get the tape, call the church, you can buy the tape.
[time=1043] This morning we're going to move past those subjects to conclude our series with a discussion of demon oppression in the life of the believer.
[time=1051] Demon oppression in the life of the believer and the text we will look at this morning is in Ephesians 6 verses 10 and following.
[time=1064] Now this text is without question the most definitive text in all the New Testament, really all the Bible that would talk about Satan, demons and spiritual warfare.
[time=1075] They are all in this text. You can see Satan in verse 11, the stand firm against the schemes of the devil.
[time=1083] You can see the demons in verse 12 talking about our struggle, not being against flesh and blood but against the rulers.
[time=1090] That's a descriptive term of the rank of demons. So is powers against world forces of this darkness against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[time=1100] Those are the demons. Our armor is discussed at length in this passage. It is mentioned in verse 13, therefore take up the full armor of God.
[time=1111] And then really the remainder of the passage goes on to describe that. And with time this morning we'll look at the armor each piece and our place in its defense of our life and our spiritual walk with God.
[time=1122] And then the command at the end of verse 13 to stand firm, having done everything to stand firm.
[time=1129] Now there are other passages in the Bible where we can talk about Satan. We could go to 2 Corinthians 11 and learn about Satan.
[time=1136] We can learn about the demons almost in a similar descriptive way over in Colossians 1, 16. Their ranks are listed there, then very little else is said about them.
[time=1145] 1 Peter 5 tells us to resist the devil. And James 4 encourages us that if we do resist the devil he will flee from us.
[time=1154] But there is no other passage in all the New Testament that brings all of these elements together. Satan, his demons, the command to stand against the spiritual forces of wickedness.
[time=1165] And then describing our resources in particular to do that.
[time=1170] So I want to say this morning that while I have in a sense debunked the overly sensational spectacular movement inside of evangelical Christianity today with an overt emphasis upon demons and what they do.
[time=1186] I believe there's a lot of bad theology involved in all of that and I'm concerned that the Christian mind is building its understanding about Satan and demons more on fiction than it is on theology and that was all last week.
[time=1198] I want to come back this week and reaffirm the fact that we are indeed in a spiritual battle.
[time=1205] And there are many signals of that in this passage. Look for example at the beginning of verse 12. It says for our struggle is not against flesh and blood.
[time=1215] Paul through the inspiration of the Spirit of God chose the word struggle, the Greek word behind it means to wrestle.
[time=1221] And it's talking about hand to hand combat. It's talking about up close and personal face to face individuals confronting Satan and his schemes of wickedness.
[time=1232] It is not describing there some general generic battle that the church at large is having against the demonic forces at large.
[time=1241] He is saying that in your Christian life and in my Christian life there will be specific and up close personal encounters if you will with the schemes of Satan and we are called upon to stand firm against them.
[time=1257] In verse 13 it says at the end of the verse that we are to do everything to stand against them having done everything to stand firm.
[time=1265] It describes really a life and death struggle in which we are called to pay the ultimate price for obedience in our lives against the schemes of Satan.
[time=1277] We're reminded of Hebrews chapter 12 which says you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood and you're striving against sin and that's in the context saying Christ did and so should you.
[time=1288] So there is a battle between truth and air between your obedience and your disobedience and it is a battle of extremes in which we are to walk obediently even if it means our own lives.
[time=1301] But I want you to notice that these schemes spoken of here are nowhere defined or explained.
[time=1310] What are the schemes of the devil? You'll notice the whole emphasis and the focus of this passage is not to develop the schemes of Satan and not to develop the ways that he employs the powers and the rulers and the world forces and the spiritual forces of wickedness inside of his schemes.
[time=1329] The Bible in fact refuses to give any great description or detail or involvement of what is going on behind the natural to the supernatural.
[time=1338] It alludes to it, it states it's there, it says it's real and it's powerful and you'll struggle against it almost in the analogy of hand and fist in battle but it refuses to describe it.
[time=1349] It refuses to open up behind the natural to let us peer in there and see what is going on.
[time=1357] Some people suggest that the schemes, some of the people that I read in the last several weeks, the schemes of Satan come all the way down to one guy I read and said when I lose my car keys, when I am caught in traffic for an important appointment,
[time=1373] when I find myself embroiled in an argument that's going nowhere, when I have a bad attitude about my life, my wife, my kids, whatever,
[time=1383] I am first looking to demons as the source of all that stuff.
[time=1389] Demons are the ones I first would look to blame for the fact that my car keys I can't find, or that I'm stuck in traffic on and on and on all the way down to his attitude as if some demon had jumped on his back and was now bringing the, it was the demon of depression or the demon of sadness
[time=1405] or the demon of lethargy and somehow this demon's very presence can convey that feeling and attitude to that person.
[time=1413] That's how they want to define the schemes of Satan because they feel free to define it by their own experience rather than the word of God.
[time=1423] Now once you open the door to that, who knows where it takes you?
[time=1427] I have had some experiences with this, what may have been, the schemes of the devil.
[time=1433] When I was at junior in high school, it was about 11 o'clock at night and we were sitting outside my friend's house in my car, going to say good night, little town called La Salivos.
[time=1446] And when we were just sitting there chatting and nothing overtly sinful had occurred in that evening and it was just a normal thing and good night and good bye and we were just a little bit of length and saying goodbye.
[time=1456] And I suddenly felt an incredible presence of evil.
[time=1462] I mean an overwhelming sense of evil and it terrified me.
[time=1469] It's difficult for me sometimes to even talk about it because the fear that I felt can come back so quickly to my mind in my memory.
[time=1478] I remember the night as if it were last night and I said to the person sitting next to me, do you feel anything?
[time=1488] And the person looked over me like I had three heads.
[time=1491] You know, no.
[time=1493] You don't feel anything at all like a presence?
[time=1496] No.
[time=1497] You're not scared?
[time=1499] No.
[time=1501] So I sat there alone in my fear.
[time=1504] And it just continued to increase and the conversation stopped and the person was just kind of looking at me and I began to weep.
[time=1512] Water began to run out because I was so terrified.
[time=1515] And I had the impression that it was coming from somewhere behind me so I turned around and looked down this street to an intersection.
[time=1522] There's a little lost country town type thing, an intersection in a flagpole right in the middle of this intersection down behind me.
[time=1528] And to my best understanding, there was a presence of something incredibly evil that was making me feel as scared as I've ever felt in my life and it was just right of the flagpole in the darkness of the shadows.
[time=1543] I didn't see anything lurking there.
[time=1545] I didn't see anything move.
[time=1547] But if you wanted to ask me, where do you think that feeling is coming from?
[time=1550] It didn't appear to be coming from my mind or some scary movie I had seen, some flashback to something like that.
[time=1557] It was right down there.
[time=1560] And I didn't think anything about it.
[time=1562] I just said good night and then went home.
[time=1566] Last year I had a similar experience.
[time=1570] We were running a house not too far from here.
[time=1572] We'd moved in.
[time=1573] We were in there about, I don't know, two months, three months.
[time=1576] Of course, we had to wait to sell our house in California until we could buy a house.
[time=1579] So we were running this house.
[time=1580] We were all moved in.
[time=1581] Everything was in order.
[time=1582] And I was laying there at night and how do you and I had gone to bed and I think it was about two in the morning.
[time=1590] I don't even know why I was awake.
[time=1592] And I began to feel absolutely intimidated beyond my wildest dreams by an evil, what I would call an evil force.
[time=1604] And again, the goosebumps started to form on my body and I had that terrified feeling you used to have as a kid where you didn't want to move.
[time=1611] You remember?
[time=1612] You're so scared.
[time=1613] You just didn't even want to open your eyes because you figured if you didn't open your eyes nothing would happen.
[time=1617] So you hit them in the covers.
[time=1619] Exactly how I felt.
[time=1621] Paralyzed by it.
[time=1623] And I finally eked out the word Heidi.
[time=1628] Are you awake?
[time=1631] And she said yep.
[time=1633] I said are you, do you feel anything?
[time=1638] She said yep.
[time=1640] Are you scared?
[time=1643] She said yep.
[time=1646] And we were too scared to talk much.
[time=1649] We just laid there.
[time=1651] And I finally got the nerve to lift my head up off the pillow and I felt like it was right there in the doorway coming into our bedroom.
[time=1660] Just at the top of the doorway just hovering this little ball like a basketball size is right there.
[time=1665] I couldn't see anything.
[time=1666] There was nothing to be seen, just darkness.
[time=1671] And I mean to tell you I can't ascribe the sense of oppression and fear that absolutely filled me from head to toe and I just laid there.
[time=1679] And in my mind I affirmed every truth I can remember about God and about Christ and about salvation and about His protection and about His deliverance.
[time=1690] If I said it 10 times, I must have said it 150 times, I believe in Jesus and I am His.
[time=1697] I believe in Jesus and I am His.
[time=1701] Over and over and over and over again.
[time=1705] Until finally, whatever it was, left.
[time=1712] Went back to sleep.
[time=1713] In fact I reconfirmed this with Heidi this morning, I was afraid to say it in public.
[time=1717] So I, that sounds kind of weird, doesn't it?
[time=1719] So I said to Heidi, I said, "Honey do you remember?" and she remembered the exact same thing I remember.
[time=1725] What was that?
[time=1727] Was that a demon?
[time=1730] A spirit being, sitting, hovering above my doorway making both my wife and I recognize its presence was there.
[time=1738] You know what?
[time=1740] I don't know.
[time=1742] I have absolutely no idea.
[time=1744] And frankly, I don't care.
[time=1749] Why?
[time=1751] Because the Bible doesn't talk about it as being a prevalent reality in my Christian experience.
[time=1761] Anytime you allow your experience or my experience or somebody else's experience to begin to define truth about God, about Christ, about demons, about anything in that arena.
[time=1780] It's every man for himself.
[time=1783] You've just stepped off the foundation of the Word of God onto a bunch of nothing.
[time=1789] You say, "What does the Bible say about the schemes of Satan?" Well, let's look at that.
[time=1792] We can do that very briefly this morning because there are very few passages that address it.
[time=1796] Come with me to the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 2.
[time=1800] 2 Corinthians chapter 2.
[time=1808] There are only about five or six passages that we can even look at.
[time=1813] 2 Corinthians chapter 2 verses 10 and 11.
[time=1817] It says, "But whom you forgive anything, I forgive also, for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did it for your sakes in the presence of Christ."
[time=1825] Verse 11.
[time=1826] In order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.
[time=1832] You say, "What's going on here?" This is a reference back to 1 Corinthians chapter 5.
[time=1838] Remember I mentioned to you the man we call the incest man?
[time=1841] He was having sexual relationships with his father's wife, probably his stepmother to him.
[time=1849] He was involved in incest and the Corinthian church was not aghast at it and did not discipline him as they had been instructed to.
[time=1857] And they let this guy continue to live in their church, a normal course of life, and so Paul sent the guy out of the church.
[time=1864] And it says over there in 1 Corinthians 5 that he delivered him over to Satan.
[time=1868] The man was living in disobedience, refused repentance so he delivered him over to Satan.
[time=1872] But apparently this man is repented and he has had sorrow for his sin and he has turned from his sin.
[time=1879] And now the problem is that the church won't let him back in.
[time=1882] They are refusing to forgive him.
[time=1885] Look at verse 10.
[time=1886] "But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive." They apparently wanted more discipline for him.
[time=1892] Up in verse 6 it says, "For sufficient for such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the majority.
[time=1899] So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest somehow such a one be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow."
[time=1907] In other words, they had finally disciplined this guy as Paul twisted their arm to do it.
[time=1913] But once disciplining him, he repents and is full of sorrow and is seeking forgiveness and restoration back into the church.
[time=1919] And the people put a big stop sign in front of him.
[time=1922] That is what Paul identifies as falling into the schemes of Satan.
[time=1928] Sounds pretty normal, doesn't it?
[time=1930] Sounds pretty natural.
[time=1932] Sounds pretty commonplace.
[time=1934] In fact, I think you could broaden it to say this.
[time=1936] Any time the church does not extend forgiveness and grace and mercy and sympathy and exercise spiritual gifts towards one another,
[time=1945] anytime the unity of the church is under attack you can bet it is a part of the schemes of Satan.
[time=1951] But I'll suggest to you that that is going to come through very natural, normal means, even as it is here in this passage.
[time=1958] There is no illusion here to demons producing this kind of thing.
[time=1963] Although we believe they're behind the scenes, but that is not the focus.
[time=1966] The focus is on the people doing what the people ought to do, which is to forgive him and bring him back into the family.
[time=1972] So it's very normal.
[time=1974] 2 Corinthians 10, come over a few more pages.
[time=1977] You'll see a different kind of scheme of Satan, this different kind of ministry that he has in the life of the church.
[time=1988] We can begin in verse 3.
[time=1991] 2 Corinthians 10, verse 3.
[time=2005] Paul is saying that I am in a spiritual battle, but I do not fight my battle with the weapons of the flesh.
[time=2009] And that's nothing new to Paul.
[time=2010] Paul has always said that.
[time=2012] Paul has always said I don't come to you with arrogant or flattering speech and superiority of my linguistic abilities as a preacher.
[time=2018] That's not what got you guys saved.
[time=2020] What got you saved as he speaks over and over to these churches is the power of the Spirit of God working through the simple message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2027] I don't lean on the flesh.
[time=2029] My weapons, verse 4, are weapons of warfare, not of the flesh, but divinely powerful for the destruction of fortresses.
[time=2037] Sometimes you can translate that stronghold, and there are a group of people inside of Christianity that want to take this stronghold or fortress mentality and just go nuts with it.
[time=2046] And say that what that is is that some kind of unconfessed sin inside of the believer, or really any person at all.
[time=2052] And as long as there is a fortress, an unconfessed sin inside the person, and the demon inside doesn't have to come out, doesn't have to be delivered until the person confesses all that stuff, all that particular sin.
[time=2064] But is that what the Bible says?
[time=2066] Look at the next verse.
[time=2067] "For we are destroying speculations, and every lofty thing raised up against the knowledge of God, and we are taking every thought captive to the obedience of Christ."
[time=2079] This is your basic generic truth of the doctrine of the Bible.
[time=2084] And this is what Paul has been in conflict with since the beginning.
[time=2087] He is constantly fighting false prophets and false teachers who are espousing the demon doctrines of seducing spirits.
[time=2094] This is not some ethereal, spectacular, sensational, bizarre thing that's going on.
[time=2100] This is the very normal process of preaching the gospel and destroying faulty thinking about God, about Christ, about the Bible, about the church, about heaven, about hell, on and on and on.
[time=2112] So once again, though it is supernatural, though it is a spiritual warfare, it is communicated and dealt with as we contact it in very normal ways.
[time=2126] 2 Corinthians now, chapter 12, go over a few more pages.
[time=2130] You'll see Satan at work again.
[time=2134] And this is Paul, still, talking about his life.
[time=2140] 2 Corinthians 12, verse 7, "And because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me, to keep me from exalting myself."
[time=2155] What's he talking about?
[time=2156] After Paul came to Christ, the Lord removed him from the Christian community, took him often to a desert and left him there for a great number of days, months, maybe years, where the Lord Jesus Christ revealed to him these revelations, you see them referred to at the beginning of verse 7.
[time=2171] It is out of these revelations that the Apostle Paul wrote most of the New Testament. He got his information not from the Old Testament because he had to write the mystery in the New Testament. He didn't learn that from saints, he got that by direct divine revelation from God and then under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, penned most of the New Testament.
[time=2189] What Paul is saying is, "All that stuff was given to me, and to keep myself from exalting myself, or to become proud, or to become hotty, because I was the one who received it, and I am the one who talks it, and I am the one who writes it, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to buffet me."
[time=2209] Now, nobody really knows what that thorn is. Some have suggested that it was poor eyesight because you'll notice in one of his epistles, he writes with a large hand, he makes a reference to that, meaning that he's so blind and if he's going to see his own writing, he's got to make huge letters.
[time=2225] Maybe it was his eyesight. Some suggest chronic migraine headaches. Others say epilepsy. Some say about with malaria, that just wouldn't go away. There are some who would say the messenger here is not a physical problem, but a human being, an actual human being that has come into Paul's life and impaled his flesh, and if you think about where you're most often hurt, it's not from physical problems, it's from relational problems, and there are some who would say that the messenger is not necessarily a physical ailment, but a person of some kind.
[time=2254] But regardless of all that, I want you to notice several things about this. Paul does not pray to Satan, commanding Satan, or to demons about being delivered from his thorn in the flesh.
[time=2268] Look at verse 8, "Concerning this, I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me." His prayer was directed at God. Verse 9, "What was God's response? My grace is sufficient for you. For power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast about my weakness that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am well-contented with weakness, with insults, with distress, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake.
[time=2296] For when I am weak, then I am strong." In other words, the effort here is not to identify Satan, identify his schemes, and remove his presence from the life of the Apostle Paul. Paul requested that God said, "No, instead," he said, "Paul put your focus back on you, your walk with me, and allow this calamity in your life to produce in you the character of godliness, dependence, sense yourself as being weak, and therefore become strong because it's the people who are really dependent upon Christ who have the most strength.
[time=2325] They have the most strength to live in their Christian lives." The next thing you'd want to notice about that passage is that thing isn't going to stop.
[time=2335] That thorn in the flesh isn't going to go away until win, until God takes it away.
[time=2340] It's all a part of God's sovereign plan to perfect and mature the Apostle Paul.
[time=2346] Come over to 1 Thessalonians for a minute. 1 Thessalonians chapter 2.
[time=2352] And you can see Satan at it again. Satan is busy oppressing the saints. 1 Thessalonians 2, 18.
[time=2367] He says, "Therefore we wanted to come to you. I, Paul, more than once, and yet Satan thwarted us." What's he saying? Paul had been to Thessalonica. Paul had led many people there to Christ.
[time=2380] They had come to know Christ through the Apostle Paul. He had left on other missionary journeys and wanted to come back. He wanted to go back and minister to those people and refresh them in their walk with God and answer their questions and encourage them along their way, but he couldn't.
[time=2393] He made plan after plan, at least more than once, and Satan stood in his way. You say, "How did Satan do that?" We don't know.
[time=2399] We have absolutely no idea. The Bible refuses to tell us. The Bible refuses to reveal the particulars in the situation.
[time=2407] All we know is that Paul wanted to go and Satan didn't let him and somehow God allowed that to continue on in his providence.
[time=2413] Frankly, Paul didn't always want to go the right places anyway. Remember the Macedonian vision? Paul was planning to go right and God said go left and had to do that through a vision in the night.
[time=2422] There's no indication that Paul would have known exactly where God wanted him to go, and this thwarting of Satan may have been God's way of keeping Paul from going where God didn't want him to go.
[time=2434] So even here where the ministry is being prohibited, Paul isn't up in arms over that. Paul isn't saying, "Oh my goodness, we've got to have a million prayer meetings, and we've got to deliver these people of Thessalonica from the oppressing spirits which are prohibiting me from getting there because I have to get there." None of that.
[time=2448] Just for their own encouragement, he's saying, "I want you to know something I haven't deserted you. I love you. I remember you. I pray for you constantly. In fact, I've made several attempts to come to you, but Satan has thwarted it."
[time=2459] That's the sum total of it. That's all there is. One more passage. 1 Peter 5. 1 Peter 5. This is an interesting situation. 1 Peter 5 verse 8.
[time=2479] Be of sober spirit. Be on the alert. Why? 1 Peter 5. 8. Your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. The word to devour there is a word right out of the animal kingdom. It means to suck down whole without even chewing up kind of like a snake swallows its prey by just bringing it into its body where it later ingests and digests it.
[time=2508] You see, what does that like? What does he do? I mean, he's not a roaring lion. He's like a roaring lion. What does he do when he prowls around? How does he devour us? Well, look at verse 9.
[time=2520] But resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world. So somehow it involves suffering. And if you study the book of 1 Peter, you'll know that it's all about suffering. These saints are even addressed at the beginning of the letter as aliens as scattered abroad because basic ordinary oppression to Christ, the persecution of the church, which you can read about in the book of Acts, was scattering these believers all over these various regions.
[time=2549] Of the land. It's not, it's nowhere revealed to us what the demons are doing, how they're doing it. It is a very normal process of an ungodly age repudiating Christ and those who stand for him and making them suffer persecution, whether it be police arrest or slander or riot or social ostracism or confiscation of property as we saw happen to the saints in the book of Hebrews.
[time=2578] It could go a little further. It may even involve death. Revelation chapter 2 verse 10 says this, talking to the church at Smyrna, do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tested and you will have tribulation 10 days. We don't know if that's 10 actual days or 10 periods of time.
[time=2602] Then this, be faithful until death. Then I will give you the crown of life. Satan may take your life. Satan may through this, the course of this world through the powers that be through setting up an ungodly society may take your life and that comes as no surprise to us because we know many believers have lost their lives in these ways.
[time=2627] So we say how do we define the schemes of Satan? How do we get a grip on this? Now let's go back to Ephesians chapter 6. If we're going to fight against him, couldn't the Lord be a little more specific?
[time=2640] And I'll suggest to you that he is purposefully vague because that is not where he wants your focus. That is not where he wants my focus on what they're doing and how they do it and what happens behind the very normal natural scene of affairs.
[time=2656] He wants our focus on the things he has written in this passage. One, that there is a devil and a Satan and he is aggressive and he is powerful.
[time=2667] Two, he has a host of helpers. They can be ranked as they have been said there. But nowhere do the rankings get expanded upon or defined.
[time=2678] Thirdly, take up your armor, your armor, and forth do everything in your power to obey, having done everything to stand firm. That's it.
[time=2692] So again, our focus and our tension is not to understand the details of the demonic underworld.
[time=2698] Simply, he gives us the strong sense of its sophistication and its power but then turns the focus on our walk with God.
[time=2706] Let's look at it. What is the armor? What does he give us to fight in this incredible battle?
[time=2711] First of all, he says, "Gird your loins with truth," verse 14. "Standing firm therefore having girded your loins with truth."
[time=2721] The notion of girding your loins, this is a picture of a Roman soldier. They were a long tunic. It would have gone all the way down to their ankles, all the way down to their feet.
[time=2728] And what he is saying is be prepared for battle. Before you enter into the conflict, take your robe and wrap it up in your girdle, which we'll call truth, so that you are not entangled by that in warfare.
[time=2743] What are the things that entangle the believer in spiritual warfare? What are the things that keep you and I from being prepared to fight? Words like mediocrity and lethargy and half-heartedness and a preoccupation with the things of the world, materialism and pleasure and entertainment?
[time=2763] All those things, while none of them are wrong in and of themselves, if they become distracting and debilitating in the fight, it's as if we have failed to pull the tunic up and tuck it in our belt and we are unprepared for battle.
[time=2776] The focus is on us and the things that we can control and change. Discipline, commitment, dedication, preparedness. In 2 Timothy 2, 4, it says this, "No soldier in active service entangles himself in the affairs of this world."
[time=2792] So that he may please the one who has enlisted him as a soldier. And everybody's got to make their own line on that. Everybody's got to make their own choices on that.
[time=2801] Otherwise, you get legalistic and there's nothing in this message that wants you to give up all your hobbies and give up all the things you enjoy and that God has blessed you with to enjoy.
[time=2809] He wants you to enjoy those and say thank you. But there becomes a point where the Spirit of God will reveal to you that you are entangled.
[time=2816] Your tunic is down. You can't fight the spiritual battle anymore because you're not prepared because you're entangled in the things of this world.
[time=2823] When you see that act, rooted out of your life, change it. Be prepared.
[time=2830] He next says that we have a breastplate of righteousness. A breastplate of righteousness. And again, as you would think of a Roman soldier, the breastplate would cover the midsection.
[time=2839] It would have been like a sleeveless covering of some thick material, whether covered by leather or then metal, to protect what?
[time=2848] His heart and his lungs, the vital organs in his life, the breastplate of righteousness. What is the apostle Paul saying to us?
[time=2858] Protect the vital organs of your life. Protect the vital energy of your Christianity by walking in righteousness.
[time=2866] It doesn't mean you're the righteousness that is imputed to us at salvation through salvation in Christ.
[time=2871] He's talking about practical, everyday obedience and righteousness to the Word of God.
[time=2878] Then he says have your feet shod. Look at it in verse 15. Your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel.
[time=2885] And as you know, the picture here is hand-to-hand combat and there is nothing worse than losing your footing in hand-to-hand combat.
[time=2892] A soldier that would slip on rocks or on dirt or in whatever footing or place he was standing would then be on his back and easy prey.
[time=2900] And this is interesting what he says here. So put on these boots, if you will, that give you real strong footing.
[time=2907] How does he describe it? The gospel of peace. The gospel of peace. And it seems he's indicating that you can stand firm with your feet shod
[time=2918] with the preparation of the gospel of peace to say this. I am secure. I can stand on a firm foundation that no matter what happens to me,
[time=2926] no matter what I do, I am at peace with God. My account has been settled.
[time=2933] There is nothing in my life that would indicate the wrath of God or his displeasure of my life to the point that he is just ruthlessly punishing me.
[time=2943] Those are not thoughts that concern me. I am standing with my feet shod with the gospel of peace. I am at peace with God.
[time=2950] Then he says in verse 16, "In addition to all, take up the shield of faith which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming missiles of the evil one."
[time=2961] And this is really picturesque for the day in which it was written. The word he uses there for shield describes one about two and a half feet wide,
[time=2968] about four and a half feet tall, and the soldier would stand behind it. And oftentimes he would line up shoulder to shoulder, standing behind their shield, and they would be making an advance.
[time=2977] And the advance would be met with the other soldiers dipping their arrows in fire and then shooting.
[time=2984] And oftentimes the shield would be covered with either some type of ointment or it would have been dipped in water and able to retain some of the liquid
[time=2992] so that when the dart or the flaming arrow struck and hit, the flame itself would be extinguished.
[time=3000] Stand behind it. Your whole body is covered behind it. So he is saying, "Take up the shield. What is our shield? It is our faith."
[time=3008] Stand totally covered behind your faith in Christ.
[time=3014] And again, the emphasis is upon God's ability to be a shield and a refuge to those who trust in him. Proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 says,
[time=3023] "He is a shield to those who take refuge in him." So on 18.30 says, "The word of the Lord is tried. He is a shield to all who take refuge in him."
[time=3033] And when you put your faith in Christ, you are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ and your faith is what has put you there and you cannot be taken out of it.
[time=3043] You are secure. You are safe. He goes on to talk about the helmet of salvation in verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation.
[time=3051] And once your head has been attacked in hand to hand combat, they had a broad sword about four feet long.
[time=3057] And what they were trying to do with each other was to just absolutely lop the other guy's head off.
[time=3062] Or so strike it that it split his skull open and killed him.
[time=3066] And God says, "I have given you the helmet of your salvation. And if you take a blow to the head, you are protected by that."
[time=3074] Then finally, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And this is the first offensive weapon that is given to the believer.
[time=3080] It's both offensive and defensive. It can parry the blows as one is attacked. And it can also be very aggressive.
[time=3086] And we think of our Lord in Matthew 4. He's being tempted by Satan and he has this...
[time=3091] the Greek word there for the word is "rayma," same as it is here. And these are specific utterances.
[time=3096] And he is pairing the offensive of Satan. He's just giving little quotes out of the Old Testament that shut down each temptation.
[time=3103] But it's also used as an offensive reality. The word of God penetrates the hearts of men with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3111] So what do you have here? I want you to know something. He refuses to describe this in spiritual terms.
[time=3118] What I mean by that? Supernatural angelic terms.
[time=3121] He grabs the most common understanding of warfare, human natural warfare known to the world at that time, the Roman soldier.
[time=3129] And he describes that guy's armor. And he ties truth and obedience and righteousness and the gospel and faith and salvation
[time=3139] and the word of God to that human picture. He does not want them thinking about demons.
[time=3147] And how demons fight each other or fight against angels.
[time=3151] The other thing that strikes me as I look at this is, as was the Roman soldier, he is basically protected from head to toe.
[time=3158] His armor is adequate is the notion. He has everything he needs to go to war.
[time=3165] You and I have everything we need to go to spiritual battle. That is the main thrust here.
[time=3172] Look at verse 18. Don't think you're independent though. Don't think now you got your armor on. You go fight these things by yourself.
[time=3179] With all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the spirit.
[time=3183] And with this in view, be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints.
[time=3188] Be in a mode of constant dependence upon God as you walk through your life and depend on him for the strength for victory of obedience in your life.
[time=3197] And pray for me. Be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the saints.
[time=3202] We've got to be praying for each other for the victory that would be ours.
[time=3206] Ultimately, the battle is over. Christ won it at the cross. But there are a lot of skirmishes that go on every single day.
[time=3214] It's pictured by Paul as hand-to-hand combat with Satan, his demonic host against his schemes.
[time=3220] And he tells us we are absolutely completely prepared to do battle. We are lacking nothing.
[time=3229] One of the phrases that always catches my mind when I look at this passage is at the end of verse 13. Would you look at it?
[time=3237] The end of verse 13, be able to resist in the evil day and having done what? Some things? Most things? A lot of things? Everything.
[time=3253] Having done everything. Stand firm.
[time=3260] The battle for Iwo Jima in World War II was unquestionably the bloodiest of the war. Historians tell us that we lost 7,000 Marines for that island.
[time=3270] An additional 20,000 were severely wounded. It was a bloody, gory battle for a precious piece of real estate in strategy for victory in World War II.
[time=3283] It's come and gone, but the words of the great Japanese general who was commanding that place Iwo Jima live on.
[time=3294] And they really speak to the heart of Paul in this passage. Listen to what he said. This is his farewell radio message to Tokyo, to the headquarters there. He says this quote.
[time=3306] The battle is approaching its end. Since the enemy's landing, even the gods would weep at the bravery of the officers and men under my command.
[time=3317] In particular, I am pleased that our troops with empty hands carried out a series of desperate fights against an enemy possessing overwhelming material superiority on land, sea, and air.
[time=3330] However, my men died one by one, and I regret very much that I have allowed the enemy to occupy a piece of Japanese territory.
[time=3342] Now there is no more ammunition. No more water. All the survivors will engage in general attack.
[time=3353] Brave men. Living out. This kind of a principle, at least in the physical realm of warfare, they had nothing.
[time=3364] They had lost. There was no hope of victory, but they would do absolutely everything to stand for.
[time=3376] As I say, our battle is won. Christ is the victor. But he is calling you today to do absolutely everything in your life to gain spiritual victory for the cause of Christ.
[time=3391] I'd ask you to inventory your life. I'd ask you to say, "Am I doing my part in the spiritual battle for the cause of Christ?"
[time=3409] Once again, we've come to the close of the Bible hour, but we've been pleased to present to you music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and from soloist Denise Mitchell and Bill Layman.
[time=3419] The message today was in the final in a series by our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3425] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together. I hope you'll join me.
[time=3434] Our dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that I have this opportunity to come to you today and to tell you that I need you as my Savior.
[time=3443] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3448] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3451] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
