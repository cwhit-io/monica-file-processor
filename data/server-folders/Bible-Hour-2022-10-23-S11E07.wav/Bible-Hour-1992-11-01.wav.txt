[time=0] And what we have before us this morning is yet another description of the physical appearance
[time=6] of Christ, more detailed than anything prior to this time.
[time=9] It will talk about His hands.
[time=10] It will talk about His feet.
[time=16] But even now, and even in this vision, it is only spoken of to give us insight into the manner in which He will minister and is ministering to the church.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope
[time=41] you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=43] Thank you for joining us.
[time=44] In the last few days of Christ's ministry on earth, He made a promise to the church, and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.
[time=52] In our study of Revelation today, we come to a majestic vision of the glorified Christ that helps us understand the wonderful ways in which He's keeping that blessed promise.
[time=62] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it ready for today's message.
[time=65] We'll be looking at the last book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, chapter 1, verses
[time=71] 12 through 16.
[time=73] Our special music today will feature the Men's Singers Quartet singing, "Magnify the Lord."
[time=80] And a solo from Lisa Feeney.
[time=85] Let's now join our service.
[time=92] [MUSIC - 143 seconds]
[time=240] - Well, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=251] We're always so excited when you make the choice to join us for this special hour of music and God's Word.
[time=259] And I'm thrilled this morning to have Dr. Bob Provost in our worship service.
[time=265] Some years ago Bob and I worked together at the Masters College out in California.
[time=269] And if there's any man on earth that I give credit to for building in my heart a real love and interest and commitment to cross-cultural missions, it's Dr. Bob Provost.
[time=280] He took me on my first missionary trip to Asia.
[time=284] We visited six countries and the missionaries there and saw the people and gave me a piece of his heart.
[time=289] And I hope that'll even happen for you a little bit this morning.
[time=293] Bob Provost is now the point man from Send International to Russia and to Central Europe.
[time=301] It's his responsibility to orchestrate and minister to those people there.
[time=306] And so listen carefully to what he says to you this morning.
[time=310] It is always a special special blessing to come to Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=316] As I travel around the world, I take advantage of opportunities to tell people about the great work that God is doing here in and through you.
[time=324] The Apostle Paul in the book of Acts, chapter 17,
[time=330] was involved in some activity that many of you are involved in right here in Fort Wayne.
[time=337] And many of you I think are probably going to be more and more involved in such activity around the world.
[time=343] Beginning chapter 17, verse 16, now when Paul was waiting for them at Athens, he was waiting for Silas and Timothy to join him.
[time=350] His spirit was being provoked within him as he was beholding the city full of idols.
[time=355] So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be present.
[time=366] And then dropping down to verse 22.
[time=368] And Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and he said, "Men of Athens, I observe "that you are very religious in all respects.
[time=376] "For while I was passing through "and examining the objects of your worship, "I also found an altar with this inscription "to an unknown God.
[time=386] "What therefore you worship in ignorance?
[time=388] "This I proclaim to you." The Apostle Paul was always about seizing opportunities wherever he found them, whether in the synagogue or whether in the marketplace, or whether even observing an idol to an unknown God and wanting to seize opportunity.
[time=405] So he said, "Let me tell you about a God "that you don't know." He said, verse 24, "The God who made the world "and all things in it, since he is Lord of heaven and earth, "does not dwell in temples made with hands.
[time=419] "Neither is he served by human hands "as though he needed anything, "since he himself gives to all life and breath "and all things, and he made from one every nation "of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, "having determined their appointed times "and the boundaries of their habitation.
[time=439] "That they should seek God, if perhaps they might grope "for him and find him, though he is not far "from each one of us." This is a really, really powerful portion of scripture that talks about you and me.
[time=455] Because he's talking about how we all float from Adam and how God has determined our appointed times when we would be born, when we would live, and secondly, the boundaries of our habitation, where we would live.
[time=469] In our case, we've been privileged to live in the United States of America with all the great advantages and blessings that we've had.
[time=475] In other cases, people haven't been so blessed and 430 million people have had to live under the terrible oppression of the communist world and in the former Soviet Union and in Central Europe.
[time=490] But what's really interesting to me is to look back here at verse 27, where he gives explanation for the appointed times and the places that we live.
[time=501] He's saying that God is in charge of when we live and where we live, and then he says why?
[time=508] That they should seek God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.
[time=517] If you were to come with me to Russia or Ukraine
[time=523] or Poland or Czechoslovakia or Bulgaria or Romania or the six new nations of Yugoslavia or Bulgaria or even Albania, you would find people everywhere seeking after God, groping, trying to find God, trying to find truth, and here we have in America and especially here at Black Hawk Baptist Church, what an abundance of people who know the truth, what an abundance of people who have time and resources, who can go and be a part of taking the truth to those who are seeking and groping desperately, trying to find God.
[time=566] Could it be that the Lord may be putting on some of your hearts at Black Hawk Baptist Church going and helping these churches that are screaming for help that we would come and help them get the message to their cities, there's so many cities that don't have a church at all.
[time=582] There's one church in a city called Ili Chorps, 300,000 people near the Black Sea in Ukraine.
[time=588] And I first was at this church a couple years ago and they've now been building a new building.
[time=592] We were there in July and we said we'll try to help get somebody to help them with their new building, a tremendous young pastor, and so God was good and I was able to take $5,000 over to help with their building project in September.
[time=604] Then I just was there in October at a pastor's conference in Ukraine and this pastor came up to me and he had a letter for me but he had kind of a long face and he looked worried and he said, you know the money that you brought to help with our church building?
[time=616] He said, I hope it's okay what we did.
[time=619] He said, here's a letter explaining it.
[time=621] I said, well, I'm sure it's okay if you did it.
[time=623] He said, well, you know, it's wonderful.
[time=625] He gave us $5,000 and we need much more than that for the material to finish our building.
[time=630] He said, but there are eight other churches in our region that are trying to build buildings and they're all stopped because they don't have any money for materials.
[time=638] So the average salary, there's $7 or $8 a month now.
[time=640] $7 or $8 a month and the inflation is 30% a month.
[time=645] Most prices have gone up like 16 times so far in 1992, most materials.
[time=653] And so he said, I hope it's okay that we took part of the money and even though we needed it, we divided it up with these other eight churches so they could resume their construction projects and he was real worried.
[time=663] I said, that's wonderful, you know.
[time=665] May we follow your example in America.
[time=668] And so we need, not only people, but we need help to help these churches that are able to build buildings now, churches and cities where they're the only church often and several hundred thousand people.
[time=677] We're just so thankful that God lets us be increasingly in partnership in the gospel with Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=685] We pray that God will continue to bless you individually and together, and as we leave for Europe again a week from today, we request your prayers.
[time=692] Thank you very much.
[time=693] (gentle music)
[time=699] [MUSIC - 245 seconds]
[time=970] (audience applauds) - Thank you, Lisa.
[time=977] And as you're singing that song, I feel in my heart that those words are becoming truer in my life every day.
[time=983] I'm thankful for that.
[time=984] Well, if you have your Bible this morning, let me invite you to take them and open to Revelation, Revelation chapter one, we've begun a study of the book of Revelation as a church.
[time=996] And we're learning that this book is an uncovering of the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1002] And I kind of want to begin this morning by asking you a question.
[time=1005] Have you ever wondered what Christ looked like when he was here on earth?
[time=1010] Maybe his height or the color of his eyes or the color of his hair, was he a large framed man, strapping in size?
[time=1022] I guess that's hard to picture because the pictures I've always seen of him, even as a little kid in Sunday school curriculum and the picture on the wall, always show more a slight framed Jesus with a very gentle face and he's either gathering children to himself or he's healing somebody or he's around the last supper table and we carry images in our minds of what he looks like.
[time=1043] And then of course, Hollywood has decided to produce some films about him and they've asked individuals to play his role and I guess in some of our minds, there might be a physical image of what he might have looked like through that.
[time=1057] But I think it's intriguing that nowhere in the whole Bible will you find that information about Christ.
[time=1065] You'll not find his height given his weight, the color of his eyes, the color of his hair, the complexion of his skin, it's just missing.
[time=1072] It's just not there, it's left out.
[time=1075] Instead, we find where his body is spoken of versus like this one in Isaiah, for he grew up before him like a tender shoot and like a root out of parched ground, he has no stately form or majesty that we should look upon him, nor appearance that we should be attracted to him.
[time=1094] And then it goes on beyond that to Christ on the cross, he was despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
[time=1103] And like one from whom men hide their face, he was despised and men did not esteem him.
[time=1111] So really there is only when his frame or body or physical appearance is talked about, the emphasis is always upon how he was using that body to minister, how he was giving that physical frame, whatever it looked like in sacrificial service to men.
[time=1129] And it's not as if the Bible never talks about form or appearance, we think of Daniel, who was referred to as a very good looking man, you can read that in Daniel chapter one.
[time=1138] But I believe the Bible is silent with purpose in its absence of information about the person of Christ because the emphasis is rightly placed upon his body.
[time=1150] And what we, excuse me, upon the way he used his body for service.
[time=1154] And what we find in this vision of his body in Revelation chapter one, here his eyes will be spoken of and his face and his hands and his feet and his attire.
[time=1165] But once again, the emphasis will not be so that we can draw a human picture of his physical form, but again, the way he is using that body to minister on behalf of the church.
[time=1179] Let's read this vision that John received of Christ, verses 12 through 16.
[time=1186] And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me.
[time=1191] And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.
[time=1196] And in the middle of the lampstands, one like a son of man clothed in a robe reaching to the feet and girded across his breast with a golden girdle.
[time=1205] And his head and his hair were white like wool, like snow.
[time=1212] Then his eyes were like a flame of fire and his feet were like burnished bronze when it has been caused to glow in a furnace.
[time=1220] And his voice was like the sound of many waters.
[time=1223] And in his right hand, he held seven stars.
[time=1226] And out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword and his face was like the sun shining in its strength.
[time=1233] You say, well, wait a minute now, where does this vision come from?
[time=1236] Look at verse 10.
[time=1238] I, namely John, was in the spirit.
[time=1241] And we don't get a lot of help in the word of God to define real tightly what that means that he was in the spirit.
[time=1247] It's definitely not in the spirit versus in the flesh.
[time=1249] This means in the spirit in such a way that I can receive information from God in a way that transcends my five senses and even the normal use of my own mind.
[time=1260] He was able to be placed in a condition, not a dream and not a trance, but somehow in the spirit that opened to him the very heart and the mind of God as these visions come about heaven.
[time=1275] They may have been visions actually of what was going on in heaven or what is going to go on in heaven.
[time=1281] But it comes to him as he is in the spirit.
[time=1284] And then it goes on to say there in verse 10 that he heard behind him.
[time=1291] So he's entered into this vision or this thing that he's gonna see.
[time=1296] And the first thing he realizes is that there's a voice and it's a loud voice.
[time=1300] It's the voice like a sound of a trumpet.
[time=1302] So it's clear and brilliant and penetrating.
[time=1306] And it's coming from behind him.
[time=1308] And it's saying this, right, verse 11, in a book, what you see and send it to the seven churches and there those churches are listed.
[time=1316] So now in verse 12, he turns around and he's gonna look for the voice.
[time=1321] He's gonna look for the source of the voice.
[time=1323] He wants to see what it is or who it is that's talking to him.
[time=1326] And in verse 12, it says, "Having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands and in the middle of the lampstands, one like a son of man." The voice was coming from none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=1341] But when he turns, he doesn't just see Christ.
[time=1344] He sees seven golden lampstands, not a lampstand with seven arms to it, but seven distinct lampstands, probably the kind used in the Old Testament to give light inside the temple.
[time=1357] And we begin already to be confronted with a fact that this book is full of imagery and symbols.
[time=1363] And I wanna say a few introductory remarks about how to handle that, how to think that through, what that means to us.
[time=1370] First of all, I wanna say don't be afraid of the imagery, don't be put off by the symbols.
[time=1376] Instead enjoy them, use your sanctified imagination to picture what you see here described for us.
[time=1384] This would be a book that would have delighted the heart of Walt Disney and his whole commitment to animation and to bringing things to life.
[time=1391] And those of you who are artists really have a jump start on us because you're more capable at seeing and picturing what is being described.
[time=1401] But over 60 times in this book, John says, I saw, this is a book full of visual imagery, optical impressions, which are given to us to make a lasting impression, at least on him, and hopefully on us, of what heretofore has not been seen.
[time=1418] So don't be put off by it, enjoy it, relish in it and think about it and ponder on it and try to cultivate it.
[time=1424] Some of you who are artists may wanna draw it for us and give us the benefit of your gift to try to see better what is being described in words.
[time=1436] But secondly about this imagery, I think it's important to note that some of it will be very obvious in its meaning.
[time=1442] Some of it will be even interpreted by the scripture itself.
[time=1445] For example, the lampstands referenced in verse 12, that is explained in verse 20.
[time=1451] What are these lampstands?
[time=1452] Look at it.
[time=1453] As for the mystery of the seven stars, which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
[time=1465] So there'll be times, such as this one, where the imagery is just as clear as day.
[time=1469] I mean, you can't miss it because it's defined for us.
[time=1472] Other times though, it will not be as clear, and we'll have to resort back to the Old Testament to gain understanding of the imagery, of the some 400 verses, I think 404 verses in the book of Revelation.
[time=1486] Nearly 300 of those verses have reference back to the Old Testament.
[time=1491] Not by way of direct quote, but drawing from the imagery of the Old Testament.
[time=1497] Nearly 300 of the 400 verses in the book are picking up images and pictures, and truth already revealed to try to communicate the future for us.
[time=1506] And so we'll go back into the Old Testament, and we'll gain understanding and hopefully insight.
[time=1510] But there'll be a third category of these images and symbols that just will boggle our mind.
[time=1516] And there'll be no way outside of just sheer conjecture what is really meant.
[time=1522] And that's okay too.
[time=1523] This is a revelation, this is an uncovering, but it didn't say it's gonna uncover everything.
[time=1530] It's gonna uncover certain things about the person of Christ and the end of the age, and in the process of that, we're gonna run into pictures that are gonna continue to leave us befuddled and wondering, "Gee, what did that really mean?" And there again, I think the tension needs to be accepted and just let it go.
[time=1544] So in this first vision, in this book, we find this voice, the voice of Christ that sounds like a trumpet.
[time=1553] And John turns, and he sees these seven golden lampstands
[time=1559] which are representative of the seven churches
[time=1565] that this book talks about.
[time=1567] You can see those listed in verse 11 if you want, and then they are talked about in chapters two and three.
[time=1572] But draw your tension out of verse 13.
[time=1576] In the middle of the lampstands, one like a son of man.
[time=1582] So what's going on?
[time=1585] The person of Jesus Christ is in this vision pictured moving in and around and amongst the church.
[time=1593] And our minds go to some of the last words that Jesus ever spoke after his death and resurrection and just prior to his ascension in the great commission in Matthew.
[time=1604] Where he said, "In low, I am with you always, "even to the end of the age." This is Jesus with us, even to the end of the age.
[time=1615] This is Jesus ministering to his church prior to the end of the age.
[time=1619] And we'll gain from this vision insight into exactly what he meant when he'd say, "Be with us." The question is, what is he doing in and amongst these lampstands?
[time=1630] What is he doing right now in and amongst the church?
[time=1633] And I believe that the imagery in this vision needs to be interpreted in that light.
[time=1640] Because this vision is introductory to chapters two and three, where Christ is assessing, either complimenting or condemning, each church where it stands positively for the cause of Christ or where it has weakened.
[time=1654] So out of the immense nature and personality and deity of Christ and all that that would encompass, there is in these verses drawn from who he is, a vision that helps us understand his ministry and his mission right now in and for and through and to the church.
[time=1673] So that's what we're gonna see.
[time=1677] That's what we'll pick up.
[time=1678] And it's exciting because it exalts Christ.
[time=1681] And it helps us gain an understanding for who he is and what he's doing in our church, even Black God.
[time=1686] So let's get started.
[time=1688] There are five of them.
[time=1689] There are five aspects to the ministry of Christ.
[time=1692] This isn't exhaustive and it's not exclusive.
[time=1694] These are the five dimensions that are drawn for us that help us understand his ministry to the church.
[time=1700] It begins there in verse 13.
[time=1704] And in the middle of the lampstands, one like a son of man.
[time=1707] Now some discussion of his attire.
[time=1711] He is clothed in a robe, reaching to the feet and girded across his breast with a golden girdle.
[time=1721] Now we'll lean to the Old Testament for a minute and realize that this kind of attire could have been worn and was worn often by kings, also by prophets and sometimes just by wealthy dignified people who had the kind of money to have those kinds of clothing.
[time=1740] But the prevailing emphasis behind this kind of description is that of the wardrobe of the high priest.
[time=1747] And if you were to turn to Exodus 28.4 or 29.5, you would find the robe of the high priest, such as this robe.
[time=1756] And in Exodus 39.29, this girdle that was strapped around the upper chest across the breast with a golden girdle.
[time=1764] It seems to be that what is being depicted here is the ministry of Christ to his church as the high priest or the interseeding ministry of Christ on behalf of his church.
[time=1775] This is describing Christ's unequaled capacity
[time=1782] to sympathize with his church.
[time=1785] We read over in Hebrews, let me just read this to you.
[time=1789] It's Hebrews 217 for your notes, but it says here, "Therefore he had to be made like his brethren "and all things, that he might become a merciful "and faithful high priest in things pertain to God "to make propitiation for the sins of the people." What it's saying is that the emphasis behind the priestly role of Christ is that he became like us.
[time=1812] He took on the form of human flesh.
[time=1814] In the kenosis of Philippians two, emptying himself and limiting himself and taking on the form of human flesh so that he could sympathize with us so that he could know what it's like to be a human being living in a falling world and the pressures and the stress and the trauma that all that represents.
[time=1831] He has experienced it, he has gone through it and therefore he can sympathize with us as a faithful high priest.
[time=1839] Had a wonderful discussion just remembering old times with Louetta Provost before the service began and she asked me how I liked the change in seasons and I said, well, how do you now are beginning to understand what that's all about?
[time=1854] And it took us back to some conversations we'd had several years ago.
[time=1857] Bob and Louetta moved to the Masters College from Akron, Ohio where Bob was the executive pastor of the chapel in Akron, Ohio and Heidi and I were just anticipating this was gonna be the greatest thing in their life because they could get out of all that bad weather in the Midwest and come really to the Garden of Eden, you understand?
[time=1874] And so we would check in with her periodically to just see if she was as exuberant over the weather as we thought she should be.
[time=1882] She was very kind and very gracious and I think learned to appreciate some of the California weather.
[time=1886] But now and then and again she'd say, well, I really miss the seasons.
[time=1890] Well, you understand?
[time=1892] We said, oh, that must be hard.
[time=1895] But we had absolutely no sense of, we didn't know what a season was.
[time=1902] A season in California is two whole days of rain.
[time=1905] That was it.
[time=1907] You know, when temperatures really got cold in the low 60s there, my, you know, put a sweater on, we had absolutely no conception of seasons.
[time=1915] And so we tried to empathize, we tried to sympathize, but there was nothing there.
[time=1921] And that's what this is saying about Christ.
[time=1923] Christ hasn't stayed in heaven.
[time=1926] Christ hasn't stayed aloof, even in his omniscience as God.
[time=1931] And that kind of boggles your mind, but he felt the need to come and take the form of human flesh so that when you say, I'm hurting, I'm struggling, I'm being tempted or this life is hard.
[time=1943] You speak to a Christ who is in our midst and ministers to us who says, I know exactly what you're feeling because I have felt it.
[time=1952] That's always the theme of his priestly ministry among us.
[time=1956] Hebrews, let me read it again, for 14 says this, since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
[time=1967] Now watch, for we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin.
[time=1978] He's been tempted in all things as we are.
[time=1980] And some people look at that next phrase and say, yeah, but it says he was without sin, which means he really doesn't identify because he never fell.
[time=1987] I mean, how can he identify?
[time=1988] He never fell.
[time=1990] And I think this is really a statement that he knows better than we.
[time=1993] Who do fall?
[time=1995] Why do I say that?
[time=1997] Well, when a temptation comes into your life, you resist it for a certain amount of time and then you fall to it.
[time=2003] You cut off your full experience of that temptation.
[time=2008] There was more there that you never felt because you pulled yourself out from underneath the trial and fell into sin.
[time=2014] Christ never did that.
[time=2016] He experienced the full brunt, the full force of every single temptation that ever came into his life because he never sinned once.
[time=2026] He has gone places in resisting temptation and the trial of temptation that we will never go.
[time=2032] He is ultimately and supremely qualified to hurt with you and feel with you and be compassionate toward you.
[time=2040] And we know that even on a human level, when those unfortunate circumstances come into a life such as the loss of a young child to a family, there is a healthy sense in which all of us sympathize, in which all of us extend our love and our sympathy to that person.
[time=2056] But there is a unique way that another family, maybe years prior, who had lost that young child in their family and when you get those together and they say, we understand what you're feeling.
[time=2071] There's a connection there that we can't enter into.
[time=2075] We've never gone through it.
[time=2078] Jesus Christ is saying whatever it is, wherever you've been, whatever your trial, however difficult your life, my ministry in being with you always, even to the end of the ages, I understand completely and empathize and my heart goes out to you.
[time=2094] And not only does it go out to you, but I did what the high priest does.
[time=2098] I made sacrifice for your failure.
[time=2101] I died.
[time=2103] I gave my life.
[time=2104] And then of course that passage goes on in Hebrews four to say then therefore let us draw near with confidence of the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and may find grace to help in time of need.
[time=2118] Christ is absolutely committed to the trauma, the difficulty, the stress, the hardship in your life, whether it's financial, whether it's physical with health, whether it's moral, whether it's your marriage, he understands, he cares and he wants you to come to him and find that grace and mercy and strength to help in time of need.
[time=2144] So first we see him in this vision, this marvelous vision of the exalted glorified Christ in the robe and the attire of the high priest to speak of his intercessionary ministry in our lives.
[time=2157] Then next, pick it up in verse 14.
[time=2160] Now we move to some descriptions of his actual, his physical attributes and his head and his hair were like white wool, like snow.
[time=2171] He had gray hair, this picture of Jesus depicts him with a full head of gray hair and his even head is white.
[time=2178] And if you'll think about that for a minute you'll realize that that is the picture in the Old Testament of wisdom.
[time=2188] The older men who were the actually called elders of the cities and the nation of Israel in passages 1 Samuel 11, 16 or 30 you can read about these elders.
[time=2199] And even the word elder in the Old Testament means aged or bearded or gray haired.
[time=2207] And these were the elders whose responsibility it was to administrate wisdom to keep the place together, to hold the place together, to administrate an orderly society, to resolve conflicts and give direction.
[time=2218] So he is depicted to us as one with great wisdom.
[time=2224] And then in verse 14 and his eyes were like a flame of fire.
[time=2229] And he's got laser eyes.
[time=2231] And as we read in the Old Testament and the new alike we think about the searching, penetrating eyes of the omniscient God who sees through and past the facade of our lives and knows intimately the details of who we are and where we're at and what we're up to.
[time=2250] Hebrews 4 13 says, "There is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do." So we have a wise ministering Christ and all knowing ministering Christ.
[time=2268] Now look at his feet.
[time=2269] His feet are described here, verse 15.
[time=2274] As a burnished bronze, the word burnished means gleaming and typically that metal would gleam that way because of its absolute purity, absolute purity, undefiled, uncompromised brass.
[time=2290] And then to add to its glory, it is taken to the furnace where it is caused to glow.
[time=2296] So it not only has a natural glow by its own purity but then is ignited in that so that its purity is abundantly evident.
[time=2307] Why his feet?
[time=2308] We don't know for sure, but typically when a person would come into the throne room of a king, they would bow down and the king would be on an exalted or a raised throne and his feet would sit on a footstool and the first look you'd get at the king would be his feet.
[time=2326] So it seems to talk about the commanding purity that Christ would have for his church.
[time=2333] Look at the universe 15 and his voice was like the sound of many waters, the thundering powerful voice of Christ.
[time=2342] And needless to say in the memory, the very recent memory of John as he was on the island of Patmos would have been a GNC crashing into the very rocks that composed that desolate island.
[time=2355] And so he was accustomed to hearing the crashing day in and day out of the thunderous ocean as it would beat against the rocks of Patmos.
[time=2367] So what are we saying here?
[time=2368] What is his ministry here?
[time=2369] I believe that this is his purifying ministry to the church.
[time=2374] His purifying ministry to the church.
[time=2377] He's purifying our lives with the refiner's fire.
[time=2382] And you say, well, how is he qualified to do that?
[time=2385] And the response is he is the aged wise mature elder who has the ability to penetrate your life with his gaze and know exactly your condition, to exactly where you are in your walk with God and the flaws in your character and the flaws in your vision for the kingdom of God.
[time=2404] He is the one who is himself pure beyond belief and imagination and who speaks to you because of all those with authority through the voice of experience and the word of God.
[time=2417] I believe this is Christ's ministry to take us as individuals through the crucible of life, through the trials of life to refine us and to put us in tight places that would squeeze us until we must cry in our hearts with the song this morning by Lisa.
[time=2433] And that is, in my weakness, you must be strength for I am out of strength.
[time=2438] You are the one who has orchestrated this situation in my life to touch an area in my life which probably only you knew needed to be refined and touched and brought along into maturity in Christ.
[time=2451] And you have done it and I say uncle.
[time=2455] And I say give and I say continue.
[time=2460] Continue to refine me.
[time=2461] Continue to bring about purity in my life.
[time=2464] When we understand this to be a ministry of Christ we then would say we come to church not to be made happy but to be made holy.
[time=2471] We say then in our Christian life we are living for the cause of Christ not that he would fulfill me but that I could fulfill him and his vision and his glory and his heart and his ministry in the world today.
[time=2484] And Hebrews, excuse me, Ephesians five in that great picture between the husband and the wife and Christ and the bride, the church.
[time=2492] Husbands love your wives just as Christ also love the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=2496] Why?
[time=2498] That he might sanctify her.
[time=2500] Sanctification, that's the separation from evil in our lives and cleanse her by the washing of water with the word, the authoritative voice of Christ.
[time=2510] Verse 27 that he might present to himself the church in all her glory having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that she should be holy and blameless.
[time=2521] Holy and blameless.
[time=2525] I believe we have this thing so reversed in our minds that Christ somehow is supposed to give us the abundant life, the fulfilled life, the happy life, the completed life.
[time=2536] And I'm not denying that there are times when obedience to Christ brings unspeakable joy.
[time=2544] But I would suggest that a vital, vital ministry that he has when he has amidst his church even in this age is to continue to purify it.
[time=2554] To put his hand on specific areas in your life and in my life that only he can.
[time=2561] One of the prayers that I pray most often for our church is that God please convict us of our sin.
[time=2571] God please reveal to us our sin.
[time=2574] Keep us from being calloused to our own sin and walking from one failure and sinful event to the next without being broken in our hearts and in that step after step callusing our own conscience and our own heart and our own humility before God where we can be broken before him because the Spirit of God would penetrate in pierce.
[time=2599] It is one of those prayers that you cry out root out of me, my sin.
[time=2604] Dig it out of me.
[time=2605] It's as if the sin flows through my body as the blood does through my veins and I want him to go in there and get it out.
[time=2612] And it calls us to remember the one who ultimately we are to please.
[time=2619] Paul in Philippians 3 says I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[time=2626] But one thing, just this one thing I do for getting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2639] Serving him, seeking to serve him, seeking to please him and him alone.
[time=2648] For he is the one who evaluates.
[time=2649] He is the one with the penetrating gaze.
[time=2651] He is the one with the wisdom.
[time=2652] He is the one who is pure.
[time=2654] And he is the one who speaks authoritatively.
[time=2656] Then number three, in verse 16.
[time=2661] The third part of his ministry to the church.
[time=2663] And this is a little more difficult, I think, to be dogmatic on.
[time=2667] And in his right hand, he held seven stars.
[time=2672] You say, what are the seven stars?
[time=2674] Look at verse 20.
[time=2676] The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches.
[time=2680] So we have a picture of Christ in his right hand.
[time=2683] He has seven stars.
[time=2686] You say, what are those?
[time=2686] Those are the seven angels of the seven churches.
[time=2689] One probably from each church in his hand.
[time=2693] Now, what is the significance of his right arm?
[time=2696] If you were to go back into the Old Testament, Psalm 110, verse one you would find and in other places in the Old Testament that the right arm is the majestic arm of power.
[time=2706] This is his controlling arm.
[time=2707] This is the arm with which he controls the events of mankind.
[time=2712] And so he is controlling the seven angels of the seven churches.
[time=2717] But I wanna suggest to you that there is nothing as we've studied in our previous study on demon Satan and the rest of that spiritual warfare stuff to suggest that angels are in charge of the church.
[time=2731] There's nothing at all to suggest anywhere in the Bible that that would be the case.
[time=2735] So I would prefer to translate this passage.
[time=2738] The seven stars are the angels or messengers, which that Greek word could be translated.
[time=2745] Instead of angels, it could say messengers.
[time=2747] And therefore have in view Christ having in the control of his right hand the leadership of these seven churches.
[time=2754] Those human agents who are leading the churches, Christ exercises his control through them.
[time=2761] And it only points up to us the incredible importance of our study in 1 Timothy 3 of the qualifications and the godliness and the sweet and simple hearts of those who are to be brought into the leadership of the church.
[time=2777] So Christ controls his church
[time=2783] through the leadership of the church.
[time=2785] We find in the ministry of our Lord to the church, he is interceding for his church, he is purifying his church, he is controlling his church.
[time=2794] And now number four, he is purging, purging his church.
[time=2798] Look at it in verse 16 in his right hand, he has the seven stars.
[time=2802] And out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword.
[time=2807] If you're familiar at all with the book of Revelation, you know that in Revelation 19 it is that sharp two-edged sword that comes out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus Christ to slay all those who have assembled against him.
[time=2818] It is the symbol of his irresistible power in divine judgment.
[time=2823] And you say, my lands, what does that have to do with the church?
[time=2826] What does this two-edged sword of divine judgment have to do with the church itself?
[time=2833] Well, look at chapter two, verse 16 for a minute.
[time=2837] I think we gained some insight.
[time=2839] Here he is talking to the church at Pergamum and he says this, "Repent.
[time=2845] Repent therefore or else I am coming to you quickly and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth." Who are the them?
[time=2856] Look at verse 14.
[time=2858] But I have a few things against you because you have there some who hold the teachings of Balaam who kept teaching Balaak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit acts of immorality.
[time=2874] Thus you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
[time=2879] This church was harboring and propagating false doctrine.
[time=2884] There were the false prophets inside this church and the Lord says, I'm coming to your church.
[time=2891] Because of that false doctrine and I will bring judgment upon them, those who are holding teaching propagating and believing that false doctrine.
[time=2900] I believe this is Christ's commitment to purge the church of bad doctrine.
[time=2907] So I'm strengthening my thinking along those lines when I remember 2nd Peter where that whole passage is denouncing the false prophets and it says there, if God did not spare the angels, making reference to the fall of the heavenly host with Satan.
[time=2921] And if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, just absolutely wiped those people out, it goes on to say then the Lord knows how to keep the unrighteous under punishment for the day of judgment.
[time=2932] And he has specifically in view there the false teachers of false doctrine.
[time=2938] And that brings two thoughts to my mind.
[time=2940] One, I wish he'd do that more.
[time=2941] I wish Christ would in his authoritative divine judgment wipe off the face of the earth, everybody who is teaching false doctrine.
[time=2952] And I just say that unequivocally to you, I wish they were gone because they are taking people to hell with them in droves.
[time=2963] They are saying that the gate is wide and broad is the way that leads to heaven when in reality it is marked on its way to heaven but it leads directly to hell.
[time=2973] And it also reaffirms the commitment that I have for this church, that I know this church has for sound doctrine and for truth and for the propagation of biblical doctrine so that that type of threat would never be brought against our church.
[time=2991] And then lastly, as we wrap our time up together this morning, look at the end of verse 16 and his face, this is beautiful.
[time=2999] His face was like the sun shining in its strength.
[time=3003] Literally as John looked at his face it was, his face was glowing.
[time=3008] His face was just emanating glory.
[time=3010] It was so bright and so brilliant that he compared it to the sun shining in its strength.
[time=3016] And you say, well, how is this a ministry of Christ in and through his church?
[time=3022] Well, there's an interesting verse in Judges chapter five verse 31, let me read it to you.
[time=3027] It says this, but let those who love him be like the rising of the sun in its might.
[time=3034] Those of us who love God in the Old and the New Testament are those who are like and compared to the sun shining in its might.
[time=3044] What's it talking about, reflecting the glory of Christ in that great book about the church Ephesians in chapter three, verse 21, Paul's prayer is this, to him be the glory in the church.
[time=3057] This has got to be a reference to the glory of Christ that comes from his face and is reflected off us to an unsaved world.
[time=3064] The ministry that Christ has among us is to reflect his glory through us to a lost and dying world.
[time=3073] It almost seems to build upon itself.
[time=3078] It begins by interceding for us, by paying the ultimate sacrifice for our sins and then continuing to be sympathetic towards us as we struggle to live this life, giving us the encouragement and the access to go to the throne of God and receive the grace and the strength to live with purpose.
[time=3093] It comes alongside of that and says, but beyond that, I want to purify your character.
[time=3097] I want to purify your life.
[time=3098] I want to refine your motives and your goals and your vision, and I want to bring it completely into conformity with the word of my sovereign revelation in total here.
[time=3108] He then seems to have a hold of the leadership of the church so it will be directed by Christ himself so that each individual church will have a sense of its own unique vision to contribute to the kingdom of God and accomplish the great commission.
[time=3123] He goes on then to say, and I will be faithful to purge those churches that don't do that, that don't honor the word of God, that bring false doctrine into the assembly and propagate it.
[time=3135] I will come and bring judgment on those churches so that the church can be pure and complete and holy and righteous so that ultimately then I can reflect my own face.
[time=3145] I can reflect my own glory through you.
[time=3148] It's wonderful, phenomenal partnership
[time=3154] in this thing called the great commission.
[time=3158] It excites me, and I'm thrilled for the way that our church has been doing that and we'll continue to do that in the days to come.
[time=3165] Let me just draw two simple little principles as we come to an end, just two little application principles.
[time=3170] The first is where we began.
[time=3173] I believe that we are living in an age that wants us to evaluate the other person and ourselves on the basis of image rather than character.
[time=3184] We are tempted beyond our wildest dreams.
[time=3188] We are in the playhouse of Satan who has taken such complete control of this country and its media and all of the powerful lines of influence to tell us that the most important things about people are how they uphold their image and then they define whatever that is.
[time=3204] And yet the Bible refuses to let us get misdirected in the image of Christ as a physical form and forces us to look at how he used the body that God gave him to serve God and us.
[time=3219] And I believe that's exactly how we should evaluate each other.
[time=3222] We have got to get past, continually seek to get past, the external and the way in which we can fit into some image that is invoked by the culture of our day and go past that and say what makes me me and what makes me valuable and what makes a difference in this church and in this community isn't how I look.
[time=3242] It's how I'm using what God has given me in a sacrificial way for the cause of Christ.
[time=3250] And then secondly, look at verse 17.
[time=3253] I love this.
[time=3255] John says, when I saw him, I fell at his feet as a dead man.
[time=3260] When I saw Christ, I collapsed.
[time=3266] When I saw him in his glory and his splendor and his majesty and the wonder of all that he is and his purity, it absolutely took out for me any sense of strength, the stand on my own two feet and I could do only one thing that's fall down and worship him.
[time=3279] And this book, by the way, is fulfilled with more beautiful, explicit accounts of worship than any other book because it is the revelation of Christ.
[time=3288] And to see Christ is to worship him and to fall at his feet.
[time=3292] But then notice, it goes on, verse 17.
[time=3297] I fell at his feet as a dead man and he laid his right hand upon me saying, do not be afraid, I am the first in the last, the living one and I was dead and behold, I'm alive forever more and I have the keys of death and of Hades and then verse 19.
[time=3310] Right there for the things which you have seen, the things which are and the things which shall take place after these things.
[time=3318] Beautiful.
[time=3319] He sees Christ, he falls on his face in worship and then Christ reaches down and touches him on the shoulder and says, stand up, I have some work for you to do.
[time=3329] I have some ministry for you to accomplish.
[time=3333] I have objectives for this planet that can only be done through you and by you and it brings to mind the great account in Isaiah six of Isaiah who was in the throne room of God and saw God for all he was and fell on his face and said, I am a man of unclean lips, curse me, damn me, send me to hell.
[time=3352] Which are our only response to the glory of Christ and then God touched his lips with a coal and said, but I have ministry for you.
[time=3360] Or you can think of Saul, it's all of Tarsus on the road to Damascus who was confronted by the glorified Christ in that vision and it blinded his eyes and he too fell on the ground and the only response he could have is Lord, what will thou have me to do?
[time=3377] [AMEN] Be so overpowered by your Christ.
[time=3384] Be so overcome by his glory and his wonder that there is only one response to fall at his feet and then look up and say, okay, how do I help?
[time=3393] What do you want me to do?
[time=3394] Amen?
[time=3398] Let's pray together.
[time=3399] (gentle music) - We've been privileged today to present to you music
