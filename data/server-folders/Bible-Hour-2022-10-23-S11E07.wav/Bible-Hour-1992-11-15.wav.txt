[time=604] (gentle music) - Amen, thank you, Reed.
[time=618] Well, let's take our Bibles this morning and open them to the book of Revelation.
[time=624] It's the last book of the Bible.
[time=628] And for those of you who may be visiting with us this morning I just want you to know it's our practice to select a book of the Bible and then work our way through it.
[time=636] It's called expository preaching where we'll go really word by word, verse by verse, paragraph by paragraph chapter by chapter until we've worked our way through an entire book of the Bible.
[time=648] And by that we hope to gain the thrust and the direction and the overview as well as the details and all their significance placed in perspective as we catch the heart of the writer.
[time=662] The book of Revelation was written to reveal Jesus Christ.
[time=665] You can see that at the beginning of Revelation chapter one, verse one, the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=671] This is a book all about the glorified Christ, not Christ in his humanity, not Christ of Christmas, not Christ on the cross, not Christ working miracles on earth.
[time=680] You'll have to read the four gospels to receive your information about Jesus in that perspective.
[time=686] This is a book about Jesus after the ascension.
[time=689] This is a book about Jesus after he is in heaven and glorified and really it uncovers for us how the end of the world will occur in light of Jesus Christ and in the honor of Jesus Christ and to the glory of Jesus Christ and for the praise of Jesus Christ.
[time=705] Here in this book, the book of Revelation will learn how the end of the age draws to an end.
[time=710] We'll find the end of religious systems coming to an end and the end of all political systems coming to an end and the end of all economic systems and their demise and it even describes the end of this physical planet and earth and universe as we know it.
[time=729] This is a book that takes us through the revelation given to a man by the name of John, the Apostle John and shows us how all of history will culminate in the praise and the glory and for the honor of Jesus Christ.
[time=746] It's worth our time, it's worth our study.
[time=748] It began in chapter one verses 12 through 16 with a vision of that glorified Christ and therein we saw him standing and moving among the seven golden lampstands and those golden lampstands represent seven churches, seven actual historical literal churches, about 90 A.D., some 30 years after,
[time=772] rather 60 years after the death of Jesus Christ.
[time=777] These are churches that were in Asia minor, all seven of them.
[time=781] And this vision really sets us up as a jumping off point from which to really have then Christ evaluate all seven of those churches.
[time=792] It first pictures him moving in and amongst the lampstands as the one who is interceding for the church and purifying the church and controlling the church and purging the church and taking care of the church and all of its needs and reflecting his glory through the church.
[time=808] But after that vision then, when you begin chapters two and three, he looks specifically at each one of the seven churches and evaluates it in light of the end of the age.
[time=818] In light of the fact that all of history will consummate in the glory of Jesus Christ.
[time=823] And the first church we come to this morning is the church at Ephesus.
[time=827] And this little letter to the church of Ephesus, these first seven verses of chapter two are really remembered by the Christian community because of verse four.
[time=837] There is a phrase there that seems to be indelibly carved into the mind and the heart of a believer.
[time=843] He says this in chapter two, verse four, but I have this against you.
[time=848] That you have left your first love.
[time=857] And I believe the reason that rightly so, that little phrase catches in our mind and refuses to leave it is because that has got to be the worst possible thing that could ever be said about a believer.
[time=871] You have fallen out of love with God.
[time=875] You have fallen out of love with the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=879] That's worse than a believer murdering somebody or a believer stealing or committing adultery.
[time=884] That's worse than any type of behavioral thing that could possibly happen.
[time=888] Because once the heart is turned from affection towards Christ, once that love has been left, then all sinful behavior becomes possible in that person's life.
[time=899] But where the heart stays fast and holds true to a genuine love of God, none of the sinful behavior is even a possibility because as Jesus said in John 14, if you love me, you'll what?
[time=912] You'll keep my commandments.
[time=915] Some people think about the origin of evil.
[time=918] And they say to themselves, why in the world would God have ever given Adam and Eve the choice to fall into sin?
[time=928] I mean, there they were created perfect in the image of God and the perfect garden of Eden.
[time=933] There was no sin in the world at that time.
[time=936] Why did God allow that to happen?
[time=938] Because once that happened, look at all the death and look at all the sin and look at all the misery and look at all the stuff that's gone on on this planet because God allowed Adam and Eve to have the choice to choose evil.
[time=951] And I'll say to you, the answer to that question is rather simple in my mind.
[time=955] If there's anything we know about God, it's this, God longs for genuine relationship.
[time=962] We read in the Bible about the Trinity and how Jesus Christ was face to face in John one with the Father in perfect fellowship, in unadulterated love.
[time=973] God has built us to enjoy relationship with Himself.
[time=978] And if He made Adam and Eve any other way, then it wouldn't have been a real relationship.
[time=984] If they had to always obey, if they had to love them, it wouldn't have been love.
[time=989] Love is a choice, love is a direction of a person's heart that says, "I will seek the face of God." And without the opportunity not to seek the face of God, then it wouldn't have been love for Adam and Eve.
[time=1003] So God, in a sense, and think carefully about this, risked that all that we have seen as the consequences of the fall because He longs for true genuine love relationships.
[time=1016] We know sooner move out of the book of Genesis than we come to Deuteronomy chapter five and find there the great 10 commandments, the great things which God, the rules and principles with God etched with His own finger onto stone to communicate to man his heart for how men ought to treat him and how men ought to treat each other.
[time=1034] But as soon as you're done reading Deuteronomy five, you come to Deuteronomy six and you collide with the great shamaw of the Old Testament, which is that you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength.
[time=1046] This was the scripture that they would bind up on little parchment and throw in a little box and wear on their body or tie to their doorway.
[time=1057] This was what they would repeat three times a day that you should love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength.
[time=1063] It's as if God is saying, don't be confused.
[time=1065] Religion doesn't consist in your keeping those 10 commandments.
[time=1069] That's not what this is all about.
[time=1071] That's not why I brought you into existence and out of Egypt and into relationship with me.
[time=1076] Those are just what it would look like if you loved me.
[time=1079] A person who really loves God will keep the 10 commandments because they are an expression of love.
[time=1085] God has always longed for relationship.
[time=1089] Matthew 22, Jesus reiterates the same truth when he's challenged by some scribes and Pharisees.
[time=1094] And they say to him, which is the greatest of all the commandments?
[time=1097] And almost without need to think or ponder, he responds to them that you love the Lord, your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength.
[time=1106] All the law culminates in a love relationship with God and then he adds, and that you love your neighbor as yourself because he understands how it works.
[time=1115] If you truly love God, then you'll also truly love your neighbor.
[time=1119] The one can't stand without the other.
[time=1121] The question is often raised, why in the world would God save me?
[time=1126] And when I understand myself in light of the word of God as an unholy, unrighteous, depraved, ungrateful sinner that's at enmity with God, deserving death that I violated his absolute holiness, I deserve nothing but death, I am helpless, I cannot save myself, why in the world would God save me?
[time=1146] John 3, 16, for God so what, God so loved.
[time=1151] The whole theme of redemption is bound up in a love relationship with God, that's why he redeemed you and that's what he redeemed you for to be in a love relationship with God.
[time=1162] It becomes a litmus test of true Christianity, Matthew 10, Jesus says this, he who loves father and mother more than me is not worthy of me.
[time=1172] God is saying here, he's not even willing to be among the company that you love.
[time=1177] These are the group of people that I love, he doesn't want to be just one of those, such as your father and your mother, he wants to be the preeminent one inside the group of all those you say you love.
[time=1188] And if it isn't enough to be tested on your love for father and mother, the Lord then adds, he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
[time=1196] He is not content with being one of the people you love, he insists on being the one you love the most.
[time=1205] The one you love the most, the one your heart is most tightly tied to.
[time=1210] In 1 Corinthians 16, 22, Paul very fittingly says this, if anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed.
[time=1219] In other words, Paul is saying the only natural response, the only response that would be commensurate to a proper understanding of our sin six souls and our depravity and our unregenerate state and to see the glory and the wonder of the awesome Lord who came and lived and died and was risen again that we might have life is to give him preeminent love.
[time=1240] And so Paul says, if you don't love the Lord be accursed and then he adds amen as if to say so be it.
[time=1247] There could be in no other way, there could be no other conclusion to draw.
[time=1250] If the human refuses to fall passionately in love with the God that created and then saved him, there's only one thing to do with that kind of human being, curse them, send them to hell.
[time=1265] It all begins and it all ends with a passionate love relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1271] You say, what is that?
[time=1273] What does it mean to love God?
[time=1275] Well, I'm not sure I know in totality but it seems to be echoed by the words of David in Psalm 42 as the dear pants for the water brook sow my soul pants for the oh God, my soul thirst for God, for the living God.
[time=1291] I think that gives us some understanding as we would picture there on a desert plane that is dry and barren and there a little deer comes along and because of the drought hasn't had water for a great period of time, knows its own life is in jeopardy of expiring and so it pants and its tongue hangs out of its mouth and its legs are feeble and wobbly and it knows there is but one thing, but one thing that can keep it alive, water.
[time=1321] So it should be in the heart of the believer seeing the sick and destitute condition of its own soul even after regeneration and being more aware of how sinful we are even though we've been forgiven by the grace of God through Christ and we like a deer in a desert would pant for God and God alone.
[time=1340] The words of Paul and Philippians chapter three where he says and I consider all things but loss.
[time=1347] Everything in my life I consider to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord and the word knowing could have been translated loving.
[time=1357] It describes that intimate personal relationship.
[time=1360] Paul knew his whole existence began and ends and existed or was maintained in that love relationship with God.
[time=1368] One of the great periods in America's history
[time=1374] was captured in the great awakening in the middle 1700s.
[time=1378] There was there in the middle of that great spiritual revival which we who know Christ would long for to take place in our day and age where people in droves were coming to Christ in sincere and genuine repentance of their sins.
[time=1393] They talked about it as if the wind was blowing across different parts of our country and it was the wind of the spirit of God and it would impact the particular geographic location and just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people would come to real true saving faith in Jesus Christ and repent and come under the authority of the word of God.
[time=1412] How we would long for that today but one of the men who was a driving force used by God in the great awakening a man by the name of Jonathan Edwards.
[time=1421] Listen to his passionate pursuit, his longing for God.
[time=1425] He wrote this shortly after his conversion.
[time=1427] I felt great satisfaction but that did not content me.
[time=1432] I have the imminent longing of soul after God and Christ and after more holiness where with my heart seemed to be full and ready to break which often brought to my mind the words of the psalmist my soul breaks for the longing it has.
[time=1448] I often felt a mourning and lamenting in my heart that I had not turned to God sooner that I might have had more time to grow in grace.
[time=1457] Jonathan Edwards wrote that at his conversion.
[time=1461] He was 17 years old and he was smitten with a love an insatiable love for God and a passion for Christ and it carried him all of his life.
[time=1473] And if you've read his biography you'll know he ministered at the same little church with about 150 people for 23 years.
[time=1479] One of the great minds in American history a tremendous man of the faith and man of the word incapable of articulating the word of God with power and conviction and yet that little church refused to grow, refused to change and after 23 years they sent him out on the streets and left him and his family.
[time=1500] But through all of that he hung on with what he called strong religious affections and he burned hotter in his heart for God the day he died than the day he was born again.
[time=1512] And so it would be with the person who would love God.
[time=1515] So it would be with the person who would stand strong for the cause of Christ in a day such as ours where we have people who are full of passion and full of preoccupation but it is for the things of the world and for the things of pleasure and for the things which are comfortable and easy.
[time=1533] But we at times look long and hard for the people in this world who are consumed with a passion for Christ.
[time=1542] I want to linger just a little bit longer in this introduction to more clearly define what I believe he means when he says you have left your first love.
[time=1552] This is not the first time that Jesus has come to the awareness that they have left their first love not maybe this particular church but throughout history.
[time=1563] Those who have once vowed love and fidelity to God have soon turned their heart and left that love.
[time=1571] In the Old Testament God speaking to the people says this, I remember concerning you the devotion of your youth, the love of your betrothels.
[time=1582] You are following after me in the wilderness through a land not sown.
[time=1586] Israel was holy to the Lord.
[time=1588] He's talking and referring back to those first fledgling moments of the nation of Israel when they had been ripped from the womb of Egypt by the great 10 blows or plagues as we call them and God was leading them to Mount Sinai where he would give them the law and make formal marriage vows to them in covenant for the salvation of the nations of the earth and along that way from Egypt to the Mount Sinai there were times when they were hungry and he fed them.
[time=1615] There were times they were thirsty and he gave them drink and he courted them so to speak.
[time=1619] He brought them in that courting relationship through the plagues as they watched his marvelous power to release them from the most powerful nation on the earth and then to provide for them in the wilderness all a courtship as he brought them to that final moment of their wedding at Mount Sinai.
[time=1636] He remembers back upon that concerning the devotion of your youth, the single-mindedness, you loved me, you cherished me, you set your heart and your affections on me, the true and living God.
[time=1647] And we had a love of betrothal, we had that beginning love, that fresh love, that invigorated love, that first love.
[time=1655] But as you know the Old Testament they turned their hearts against that God and he says to them, what injustice did your fathers find in me?
[time=1664] They went far from me and walked after emptiness and became empty.
[time=1670] He cries in his heart, he longs for that kind of true
[time=1676] relationship with them and compares it to the marriage relationship.
[time=1680] And you who are married, we who have wives and you wives who have husbands, you know what he means when he talks about leaving your first love.
[time=1691] You can remember periods in your relationship where that vigor, where that intensity, where that all-consuming preoccupation with that other person just raged and flamed in your heart.
[time=1705] There was a day when that other person was the only one you could think about and no matter what you were doing, you wanted to be with her or with him.
[time=1711] And you planned special gifts and surprises and there was just a movement in your heart and your soul after that person.
[time=1721] And all too often after the wedding day, after the Mount Sinai experience, then the other loves begin to steal and take away and rob of that absolute preoccupation.
[time=1736] And there are some even here, no doubt, in the crowd the size where that emotional separation and where that sense of intimacy and the real communion of a love relationship that God designed has been lost long ago.
[time=1752] And now just the form of marriage remains, now just the legal paper of a document that says you're married in a home and cars and common kids, that is what defines your marriage but the internal essence of it, the whole reason for it from the beginning.
[time=1767] It's turned from a raging flaming fire into a barely distinguishable imber that needs to be blown and worked and prodded and helped back to its proper place.
[time=1780] That's what he means.
[time=1782] He says, "That's how you used to love me, but you left it." Another picture of this might be with the parent and the child and there are times where, and I would think as mothers you may sense this more acutely than we who are the fathers, but there are times I know in my experience with my kids when I'm left with them and Heidi's doing something else and I have them for some stretch of time that they become difficult for me and hard for me and my objective is no longer to love them but somehow to manage them and to keep them from overtaking me and ruining my whole life.
[time=1818] This afternoon I'm speaking of.
[time=1820] And they continue and they refuse to be nice and to go away and leave me alone and stop asking me questions and I suddenly feel the burning sense of irritation
[time=1835] and then anger and now I am just, just, just stop it.
[time=1840] If you know that tone, I've probably said it nicer than most of us do at home, but it's there and you kind of beat up on them and you don't feel good about it.
[time=1850] And if somebody asks you right at that moment the love of your kids, you have to think about it.
[time=1855] That first love, it's gone, it's barely remembered.
[time=1860] But then they go to bed.
[time=1863] Praise God, they go to bed and they're asleep.
[time=1867] They're not just in bed, they're unconscious.
[time=1870] They don't even know who they are anymore.
[time=1873] They've lost all sense of self-awareness because they're in that lala land of sleep and you walk in there and you look at 'em laying on that bed and all of a sudden it all comes back and you say, "No, I really do love that kid." The fact that's the most important thing on this planet.
[time=1890] Moms and dads, as you've experienced that, that's the heart of this passage.
[time=1895] John is saying to the people of Ephesus, you used to love me.
[time=1898] You used to love me, but you left it.
[time=1903] You left it.
[time=1906] You don't love me like that anymore.
[time=1909] Maybe it's for some of you men, your career and you thought all your life that everything you always wanted to be was a lawyer.
[time=1916] Your dad was a lawyer, your brothers were lawyers, your uncle was a lawyer and you wanted to be a lawyer and so you studied to be a lawyer and you went to college to be a lawyer and you went to law school to be a lawyer and you passed the bar exam to be a lawyer and you found yourself a great job with a great firm and now it's 10 years since your last exam with the bar and suddenly you wake up in the morning and say, "My land's, I don't want to be a lawyer." What am I doing being a lawyer?
[time=1942] I hate being a lawyer and that love, that passion is suddenly gone.
[time=1950] Or maybe there are testaments of this with respect to your hobbies and there was a day when all you could dream of was being a hunter.
[time=1958] I was with a person not too many days ago that had this kind of fanatical and satiable desire to hunt and he had six labradors and two pointers and three retrievers and three duck boats and it's 27 shotguns and every conceivable hunting apparel that ever came into existence and he told me about hunting trips.
[time=1978] He'd gone here and there and over there.
[time=1980] This man was absolutely engrossed, preoccupied with his hobby.
[time=1984] That's the feeling, but now you look at that and you have a closet which is a testimony to that hobby you used to have and in there is all the stuff that used to preoccupy you and draw you and now you look at it and you go, "What did I ever see in that?
[time=1998] "Why did I pursue that?" And a hobby that once totally overwhelmed you now is just something that happened.
[time=2007] And I imagine it's probably okay for that to happen with a hobby to lose or to leave your first hobby love.
[time=2014] It may be okay to lose your first career love and make a career change, but make no mistake about it, it is absolutely unacceptable to lose your first love for Christ and that's what this letter is about.
[time=2032] That's what has happened at the Church of Ephesus.
[time=2034] Let's look at it this morning, these seven verses, along seven points and these same seven points will be used as a guide as we examine all of these seven churches.
[time=2044] I'll give them to you quickly and then I'll repeat them to you as we move through them.
[time=2048] We'll look at the correspondent, secondly the city, then the church, then the commendation, then the condemnation, then the command and finally the council.
[time=2062] We'll take that grid to each one of these letters that our Lord wrote to these churches.
[time=2068] First of all, the correspondent, look at verse one with me.
[time=2071] To the angel of the church and Ephesus right, the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands says this, you say that sounds familiar, it should.
[time=2084] It's been drawn out of the vision we studied in chapter one verses 12 through 16.
[time=2089] It is the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands, who's the correspondent, who's the writer of this letter, none other than Jesus Christ.
[time=2099] And in each letter to these seven churches, part of that vision in verses 12 to 16 in chapter one will be drawn out and placed at the beginning of each one of these letters and we'll see that as we go along.
[time=2110] So this is a letter from Christ.
[time=2112] In other words, I'm moving past my general ministry to the churches at large by moving in and around and amongst them and I'm now gonna write specifically to you the church at Ephesus.
[time=2123] What about the city?
[time=2125] The city of Ephesus, we know a little bit about it.
[time=2127] We've understood some of that from our study of first Timothy, but let me remind you of a few things.
[time=2132] The city of Ephesus was the leading city in Asia Minor, it was not the capital, that was Pergamum, but the one with the real dominance and the real influence and it was the trend setter and the pace setter, it was the city of Ephesus.
[time=2143] You say why?
[time=2144] There were a number of reasons.
[time=2145] First of all, it was located on one of the greatest, in fact, the greatest harbor in Asia Minor.
[time=2153] The Kaster River was flowing down through the city of Ephesus to the Aegean Sea about three miles back up, the Kaster River you would find the city of Ephesus and that river was capable of managing ships that would bring the commerce and the trade that made Ephesus the leading city in Asia Minor.
[time=2173] In addition to its location with a harbor and a river, there were the four major trade routes of Asia Minor running straight directly through and converging at Ephesus, which only multiplied its commerce and its trade.
[time=2186] Additionally, it was an economically free city, in other words, there were no Roman soldiers stationed there.
[time=2192] Ephesus had come to a place of trust in its relationship with Rome, that Rome felt it no longer necessary to have a garrison of soldiers there, so they were considered economically free.
[time=2201] Ephesus also had the Ephesian games, which at that time rivaled the Olympics and there would be hundreds and hundreds and thousands of people that would flock to that city every season when the games would be played to participate and watch the competition and to be a part of the pageantry and the drama of all that would go on there.
[time=2224] But above and beyond all these reasons, Ephesus was the leading city because the most sacred goddess in the civilized ancient Greco-Roman world was there.
[time=2235] Her name was Diana or Artemis, the temple Artemis.
[time=2240] As you remember, this great, awesome, Ephesus was a block and a half long.
[time=2248] Think about that, a block and a half long and 265 feet wide and there were 130 columns,
[time=2256] each one stood 60 feet tall that surrounded the outer perimeter of this great temple.
[time=2261] 37 of those were covered and coated in gold and jewels, handcrafted.
[time=2268] And inside this great temple Diana were a number of activities, the first and foremost of which was their religious worship.
[time=2275] And you remember that that was nothing less than prostitution.
[time=2278] The temple was filled with thousands of male and female prostitutes.
[time=2283] And the way that you would worship at the temple Diana is you would come and you would give money and you would engage in orgiastic sex and sensuality and that was your experiencing, your feeling of experiencing the presence of the gods.
[time=2298] In addition to that, there was a marvelous museum inside the temple Diana and works of art were brought from all over the world and put on display inside this beautiful temple.
[time=2309] There was also the leading bank in Asia Minor.
[time=2312] There was a vault inside the temple Diana where people would bring their money and find receipt for that money.
[time=2318] It was the place they kept their money.
[time=2320] It functioned like a bank.
[time=2321] And oddly enough, and this makes no sense to me at all, but they're crept in to be at the temple Diana a sanctuary for criminals.
[time=2331] In other words, if you had broken the law and you could get inside the temple Diana before you could get caught by the law, you were safe.
[time=2337] They couldn't come in and get you out.
[time=2340] And so along with all of these priests and priestesses and all of this prostitution, there now came a clustering of criminals.
[time=2348] And it's no surprise to us that there were soon too many criminals to be held inside that block and a half long, 265 foot wide building.
[time=2358] And so they made a 50 foot perimeter outside the temple of Diana.
[time=2362] And if the criminals were inside that, they were safe.
[time=2365] And with time that didn't suffice.
[time=2366] Eventually the whole district of Ephesus was a safe haven for criminals.
[time=2373] This was a debauched place.
[time=2378] It was full of sin.
[time=2379] It was a grossly sinful city.
[time=2381] And like the worst parts of San Francisco or the worst parts of Chicago, or the worst parts of New York, so was Ephesus.
[time=2390] And all of its materialism and wanton pleasure and giving over to greed and sensuality.
[time=2395] So it was a corrupt city, but by the grace of God.
[time=2401] The marvelous grace of God, he sent the apostle Paul to Ephesus.
[time=2406] And we won't go back this morning and look at it, but if you want to later read Acts 19 and 20 and you will find there the most explosive beginning of any church in Asia Minor.
[time=2418] Paul came there and began to preach and preach and preach and preach.
[time=2425] And in addition to his preaching, he worked incredible miracles.
[time=2428] And the text tells us they were miraculous miracles, which is redundant, wonderful miracles.
[time=2433] They were so phenomenal that everybody was getting healed.
[time=2435] In fact, sick people who couldn't make it to the exact location where Paul was, were sending a handkerchief and letting Paul touch it and pray over it.
[time=2443] And when the handkerchief returned to the sick person, they were healed.
[time=2446] And as a result, people were coming to Christ.
[time=2449] They were coming to Christ in droves.
[time=2452] And if you will, picture yourself as one of those who had been raised in Ephesus and your mother and your father worshiped at the Temple Diana and your grandparents had worshiped there and the people before them had worshiped there.
[time=2463] This was what you were.
[time=2464] This is what you did.
[time=2465] This is how you defined yourself.
[time=2468] This was your worldview, the Temple Diana and this short, fat, stubby, ugly little guy by the name of Paul walked into your city and you heard him speaking of Jesus Christ.
[time=2479] You heard him telling the message of grace and forgiveness of sins and being in relationship with the true and living God.
[time=2485] And so you got converted.
[time=2488] You prayed to receive Jesus Christ and you went back into your house and you got out those books of sorcery that you had handed down to you through the family and all the paraphernalia that went with that cult and you brought it out into the street and you burned it there.
[time=2502] There was a great burning of all the sorcery books.
[time=2507] In fact, so vast were the conversions that the silversmiths associated with the Temple Diana who made the little shrines for the dashboard of your chariot or your neck or wherever you were or whatever you did, their business fell off so drastically that they started a riot in the city against Paul.
[time=2526] Massive conversion and dramatic conversion out of an ungodly society.
[time=2532] But by the time we come to this book, that's 40 years ago and somehow, some way
[time=2542] they had lost their first love.
[time=2544] But first, let's look at verses two, verse three and then verse six.
[time=2549] His commendation, his commendation of them.
[time=2553] He says in verse two, I know your deeds and your toil and perseverance that you cannot endure evil men and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles and they are not and you found them to be false.
[time=2565] Verse three, and you have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake and have not grown weary.
[time=2571] Verse six, yet this you do have that you hate the deeds of the nickelatons, which I also hate.
[time=2578] Let me explain these verses to you.
[time=2580] This is an amazing testimony to the strength of the church at Ephesus in its beginning and in its earliest years.
[time=2586] First of all, they were a hard working church.
[time=2589] The beginning of verse two, their deeds and your toil.
[time=2592] The Greek word for toil means to work until you're exhausted, work until you're perspiring, until you got sweat on your brow and perseverance means to keep working until you've finished your task.
[time=2602] They were a hard working, dedicated people that didn't stop until the job got done.
[time=2607] Secondly, they would not endure evil men.
[time=2611] They wouldn't tolerate evil men.
[time=2613] Do you remember in our study of first Timothy, we came to chapter five, I believe it was, where it talked about disciplining leadership and how to exercise church discipline against ungodly men inside your church?
[time=2624] Apparently they were doing that.
[time=2625] They had followed that instruction.
[time=2627] They would not endure these evil men.
[time=2631] My how I wish there were a way we could do that in America.
[time=2633] Amen?
[time=2634] Get these evil men out of our country.
[time=2638] And I know there's a vast difference between our country and our churches, but it just seems such a fitting day at which to fix our gaze on the evil men that are tearing down everything that this country has stood for through its history and the ones I would be most anxious to put out of our country would be those in Hollywood, in the executive offices that are making the decisions about programming that comes across our television.
[time=2664] When I lived in California, I lived only 20 minutes from Hollywood and it was, often I would be invited to play at Lakeside Country Club, which was right across the street from Universal Studios.
[time=2673] There was a river, a cement river that separated the course from Universal Studios and you could hear the, it's like an amusement park and you could hear the attractions and the people and the thrills and all that stuff.
[time=2684] And my dad and I were walking down the course one day on the whole that was right next to it.
[time=2689] And he said to me, what do you think of that over there?
[time=2693] And I said, well, it's interesting, it's entertaining, I guess not all of it's bad.
[time=2696] But I said, I'll tell you this, dad, if I had one wish, if I had just one wish from God that He would give me for this country, it would be that I could push a button.
[time=2706] And by pushing that button, all of those evil men who are holding those powerful positions in those producing companies that establish movies and television shows and all the rest.
[time=2719] And by pushing that button, I could just eject them right out of our country for them never to come back and with them all of their trappings.
[time=2727] In other words, all the televisions in this country and all the cable in this country and all the satellite dishes in our country.
[time=2734] Absolutely amazing what they're doing.
[time=2736] When I was in Jamaica three weeks ago, I was walking in the slums of the inland island of Jamaica.
[time=2741] People are living in shacks, little cardboard houses with no electricity and no plumbing and nothing.
[time=2748] And there's a shack and a shack and a shack and then there's a satellite dish.
[time=2752] Do you know what that means?
[time=2755] That means that they can beam in all the junk that we produce and they can take it right in to their culture.
[time=2764] It can corrupt their entire culture.
[time=2766] It's not that the people who are corrupt in our country have to get over to their country and corrupt them by physical contact and touch and discipleship in a bad sense.
[time=2775] They can just beam it in on their satellite dish.
[time=2777] Every nation in the world, even the remote people of the world can be polluted by that.
[time=2782] Evil men, well, that's a footnote.
[time=2787] But nevertheless, it ought not to be.
[time=2791] And there should not be evil men and there were no evil men in this church.
[time=2794] They would not endure them.
[time=2796] They marked them.
[time=2797] They protected themselves.
[time=2799] Because as we have talked about our own country, what the select group of men can do to everybody else.
[time=2806] So they rooted out evil and they threw it out of the church.
[time=2810] And then in verse two, and you put those who call themselves apostles and they are not and you found them to be false.
[time=2817] There were men claiming the authority of Paul or the authority of Peter or John or James and they put them to the test.
[time=2823] They compared their teaching to the teaching they had already received from Paul and it wasn't true and so they found them out and they didn't tolerate them.
[time=2833] Look down in verse six.
[time=2834] This is much to their credit.
[time=2836] Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the nickel leatons, which I also hate.
[time=2843] The nickel leatons, we don't know exactly what they taught, but we believe it was a perverted grace.
[time=2848] It was a libertarianism.
[time=2850] It was an antonomianism, lawlessness.
[time=2852] Come to God and live any way you wanna live.
[time=2855] Come to God and accept forgiveness in Jesus Christ, but then go on to live a wantantly sinful and disciplined and godly lifestyle and everything will be okay in the end.
[time=2864] In fact, that is apparently what they were teaching.
[time=2867] Clement of Alexandria, who lived at that time, says about the nickel leatons this, quote, "They abandoned themselves to pleasure like goats, "leading a life of self-indulgence, immorality, "loose living, liberty was replaced "with license and perverted grace.
[time=2882] "This church wouldn't tolerate it.
[time=2884] "This church said no.
[time=2886] "We will obey our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2888] "We will follow Him in obedience.
[time=2890] "We will stand in obedience to the Word of God." And look in verse three, all of that for my name's sake.
[time=2898] And you have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake.
[time=2903] This wasn't some type of mindless thing.
[time=2905] This was with the thought of Jesus Christ and His character and His integrity and we know that the word name stands for all that He was, all that He is.
[time=2914] And to protect that, they did all that.
[time=2917] They toiled and persevered.
[time=2918] They refused to endure evil men.
[time=2920] They exposed false apostles and they shut down this ungodly, licentious teaching of the nickel leatons.
[time=2927] Phenomenal, absolutely incredible church.
[time=2931] Wonderful beginning, miraculous beginning, by the apostle Paul himself.
[time=2936] They're burning their stuff in the streets.
[time=2938] They're turning the city upside down.
[time=2941] They're destroying the commerce associated with the temple Diana, so many are being converted.
[time=2946] And then they walk faithfully down the path of obedience and toil and perseverance.
[time=2952] And as we study the book of Timothy, the great concern there was that they would be corrupted by this ungodly doctrine and apparently they shut that down.
[time=2960] They stand for the truth, they're orthodox, they're fundamental, they stand for the Word of God.
[time=2965] And they don't live loose lives.
[time=2969] It's not just lip service.
[time=2970] They actually obey that doctrine.
[time=2971] You say, my lands, how does that happen?
[time=2975] Verse four, but I have this against you that you have left your first love.
[time=2987] Oh man.
[time=2989] Is that the story of fundamentalism or what?
[time=2993] Absolutely, totally dogmatic committed to the truth.
[time=3001] But somehow the doctrine itself became the objective.
[time=3004] And they forgot that right doctrine is only important so long as it produces in you a heart of love for God.
[time=3013] A heart of love for Christ.
[time=3015] The enthusiasm was gone, the optimism was gone, the gratitude for salvation was gone, their servant's heart was gone, their hunger to learn the Word of God to be promoted in their love for God was gone.
[time=3030] That might be a little bit, I mean, if anything,
[time=3036] if any of these churches, if any of these seven churches, if we could fall into one area, it would be this.
[time=3042] You folks are committed to the truth.
[time=3045] If this pulpit started to talk error, you'd throw me out of town and rightfully so.
[time=3053] And if for some reason you couldn't, you'd leave this church.
[time=3056] You'd leave this building, you'd get out of this place.
[time=3059] If this place stopped teaching truth and you couldn't either change it and if it had to stay, you wouldn't.
[time=3064] I believe that was all my heart.
[time=3066] I believe with all my heart that you folks, if our country degenerated at such a point and it may that we had to suffer for our doctrine at a stake to be burned.
[time=3079] I believe that most of the people in this room would stand up right now and walk to a stake and die for the truth that our church stands for.
[time=3087] I have no question about that.
[time=3089] It's one of the reasons I'm here.
[time=3091] We're like that together.
[time=3092] That's who we are, that's what we are.
[time=3095] But as we can see from the example of the church at Ephesus, it's possible to be busy in our ministry, to refuse to tolerate evil men, to expose false prophets, to shun the licentious, sensual ways of the Nicolaitans, to do all of that as we stand for the truth and yet somehow let the love in our heart, the passion for Christ dwindle.
[time=3119] You say, "Well, what do I do?" That may be me.
[time=3125] I mean, I don't know if I'm in love with him today as I was when I first got saved.
[time=3132] Look at chapter two, verse 19, first second.
[time=3134] Is this true of you?
[time=3135] Chapter two, verse 19.
[time=3137] Is this true?
[time=3138] I hope it is.
[time=3140] Verse 19, I know your deeds.
[time=3143] And your love and faith and service and perseverance that your deeds of late are what?
[time=3150] Greater than at first.
[time=3154] We'll find out more about that when we get there, but that's the notion.
[time=3158] Are you more committed to God in a passion of your heart than you were when you first got saved?
[time=3166] Is there a deeper, more compelling, more resounding love for the person of Jesus Christ now than there was before?
[time=3173] I wish we had time to go over to 2 Corinthians chapter five where Paul says, "I am constrained by the love of Christ." And the work constrained means to be between a rock and a hard place.
[time=3181] The love of Christ forces me into evangelism, into my mission, into fulfilling my calling in life to win people to Christ and disciple them up into maturity.
[time=3191] You say, "Man, no, I don't think so." Somehow I've left it.
[time=3198] And notice at verse four here, just one more second, verse four, it says, "You left your first love." It didn't say you lost it as if you're looking for it and you got away from you and like, "Where'd it go?
[time=3213] I want it back." No, it says, "I left it.
[time=3217] I left it.
[time=3218] I turned from it.
[time=3220] I walked away from it.
[time=3222] I left my first love." You say, "What do I do?" Look at verse five, three things.
[time=3227] Remember, therefore, from where you have fallen, repent, and then do the deeds you did at first, or we could say repeat.
[time=3236] Remember, repent, and repeat.
[time=3239] Remember, repent, and how do you remember?
[time=3243] I don't know.
[time=3244] But God was always concerned that His saints did.
[time=3246] Exodus chapter 12, He instituted that whole meticulously designed thing called the Passover, and they wanted it carried on for generation after generation, and some Jews still carried on.
[time=3256] Why?
[time=3257] Because God wanted the people to never forget, always remember that on that special night in the land of Egypt when you were still slaves, I sent the angel the Lord above the housetops of Egypt, and the angel the Lord killed all the Egyptian eldest sons, but it didn't touch yours.
[time=3271] Remember, remember in Joshua 4 that God parted the Jordan
[time=3277] so you could go through how by building a little monument with 12 stones, each one for the 12 tribes of Israel.
[time=3283] And every time you go by it, tell that story.
[time=3285] You say, "How do we remember?" I don't know, particularly.
[time=3288] Sometimes I turn on music, Christian music, that was really happening when I just came to Christ, and I'll listen to that stuff.
[time=3295] A lot of that was Keith Green, and sometimes that'll bring back some of that remembrance for me.
[time=3299] Maybe that helps you.
[time=3301] I know baptisms help me.
[time=3303] When I'm standing there with those people, and you're sitting there, we're all listening to that first love being articulated.
[time=3309] And they share with us, coming to Christ, and how God did that, and it refreshes our hearts.
[time=3314] That's why we need to be faithful in baptism.
[time=3316] And communion is the time to remember our first love, and to come and remember our sin and the death of Christ, and to be rekindled in our love.
[time=3325] If you've lost your first love, here's another suggestion.
[time=3327] Disciples somebody who just came to Christ.
[time=3329] Disciples somebody who just came to Christ, because all the questions they're going to ask are the questions you used to ask, which used to confuse you and excite you and bewilder you.
[time=3340] How do I study?
[time=3341] How do I pray?
[time=3342] How do I know God's will?
[time=3344] All those questions, get involved with that person who has just come to Christ.
[time=3348] In fact, there should be a whole generation of people in this church who have just come to Christ in the last two or three years, and all of us should be network discipling them so that all of our hearts would stay fresh with that first love, because they remind us on a regular basis.
[time=3363] So remember, he says, and then repent.
[time=3367] And you say, that's kind of a strong word.
[time=3369] Repent?
[time=3370] Yeah, repent, because failing to love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength is sin.
[time=3376] And we don't want to think of it that way.
[time=3378] We want to think of it as well.
[time=3379] I'm just struggling right now.
[time=3380] Or, well, you know, you go through stages in this stuff.
[time=3383] And I'm not saying that it's that euphoric first love of conversion, but it's that priority of love.
[time=3389] He is the essence.
[time=3390] He is the most important thing in my life.
[time=3393] If that's not the case, repent.
[time=3396] Remember what it used to feel like and repent, and then repeat.
[time=3401] Do again the deeds, you did it first.
[time=3403] Go back and do them over again.
[time=3404] Look for opportunities to serve like you used to.
[time=3407] Look for opportunities to spend time in the Word of God like you used to.
[time=3410] When the Spirit of God prompts your heart to pray, stop doing what you're doing and pray like you used to.
[time=3415] Be grateful like you used to be grateful.
[time=3419] Be thankful like you used to be thankful.
[time=3421] Repeat that stuff again.
[time=3422] Drop the baggage which you've picked up along the way which encumbers your simple love and devotion to Christ.
[time=3431] Or else, look at it in verse five, or else what?
[time=3434] Or else I am coming to you and I will remove your lampstand out of its place unless you repent.
[time=3441] Guess what?
[time=3442] It's gone.
[time=3444] He did it.
[time=3447] He took their lampstand out.
[time=3448] You can go to Ephesus today, you won't find it.
[time=3451] There is no church that God removed their lampstand out of Ephesus.
[time=3456] They've refused to repent.
[time=3462] As we close, let's look then at the council.
[time=3465] And these are soft and tender words from the Lord as he finishes his vision, verse seven.
[time=3470] He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[time=3475] What he's saying to them and what he's saying to you this morning is if this is making sense to you, if you're a believer, but you've drifted and you've walked away and maybe you're still involved but it's become mechanical and you're just functioning and the heart and the passion of your relationship with Christ is gone and listened to that.
[time=3491] Once again, we've come to the close of the Bible hour
[time=3497] and I'd like to thank the sanctuary choir and the handbells and read the favor for their special music today.
[time=3504] The message was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore and another in a series of his messages on revelation.
[time=3510] If as a result of today's program, you know that you need to trust Christ as your personal Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3519] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I'm a sinner, that I ask you for, I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and become my Savior today.
[time=3533] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3535] If you prayed that prayer today, write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3540] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3550] To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the booklet entitled Christ in Christmas, a Family Advent Celebration, please write to the Bible hour 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3563] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 1578 or mention the message by Pastor Moore, entitled when love grows cold.
[time=3575] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help defray the cost of providing this tape.

[time=3636] (silence)
