[time=0] This is a church that had gone through the refiner's fire, the crucible of tribulation and as a result they are without rebuke. The persecution had made
[time=11] them strong and pure and what might have been in their fellowship and in their
[time=17] personal lives that would have brought condemnation by our Lord by this time
[time=23] has been purged from them.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we
[time=42] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. The day may be
[time=48] coming when Christians may be persecuted, a day when to name Jesus Christ as Lord may bring a loss of one's job or imprisonment or even death. Today in our
[time=59] study of Revelation we will look at the example of Christians who have gone through this very ordeal yet remained faithful and received the crown of life.
[time=69] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation. We will be looking at chapter 2 verses 8 through 14. Our special music
[time=79] today will feature our sanctuary choir, a solo by Denise Mitchell and a special
[time=86] number by Reflection. Let's now join our service.
[time=116] Praise Him, praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer.
[time=124] Sing over His wonderful opera play.
[time=131] Hail with, hail Him, highest our King Joseph, glory.
[time=138] Amen, our love is in His holy name.
[time=145] By God's shepherds, Jesus will guard His children.
[time=153] In His hearts He carries them all the love of God.
[time=162] Praise Him, praise Him, God is His son.
[time=167] Praise Him, praise Him, ever-enjoyful Son.
[time=177] Praise Him, praise Him, Jesus our blessed Redeemer.

[time=497] Well hello again and thank you for watching the Bible Hour.
[time=508] We're delighted that we hear from you from week to week and we have a great encouragement to us.
[time=514] Russell this is the Thanksgiving week and we are certainly thankful for our families and our church family here.
[time=520] Both of us have families in California and so I know that makes a little bit of adjustment on Thanksgiving Day.
[time=526] It does because Thanksgiving and Christmas are so tied to family but we're thankful that we have our own family here and we can focus on that a little more and build our own traditions and so we're excited about that and then of course we'll stay in touch with the family and give them a phone call and reassure them of our love and just communicate with them.
[time=544] I'm kind of in a divided situation now with my family, one boy in Chicago and one in southern Indiana and so I have the family that comes back home here, my immediate children and then I have the same situation in California with my aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters and mom and dad out there but we do the same thing.
[time=562] We look forward to that telephone call just to reinforce the fact that we love each other, we're thankful for our families and despite of the distance there's a closeness that just really remains and that's great and we're thankful for our church family.
[time=574] We get together on Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving and fellowship together and that's great.
[time=580] Also you've been in the ministry of teaching the word from the book of Revelation that seems to be going well.
[time=586] We're talking about the churches that are mentioned there.
[time=589] Right, the seven churches and that's a tremendously impactful series
[time=595] of letters because you can't just look at what's being said there and refer it to those people.
[time=601] You inevitably bring it back to your own life and to your own church and evaluate how you're doing and so it's been tremendous opportunity to have that kind of self-evaluation and to think through the church at Ephesus having left its first love and the purity and the strength of the church at Smyrna because of the persecution.
[time=621] I mean who wants to go through that kind of persecution but yet you look at the quality of their faith and it's almost enticing knowing that though you'd have to go through it it'd be worth it.
[time=632] It would be nice to take all of the good attributes of all of the churches and hope that our church, our body of believers would attain to that kind of purity but unfortunately even though we have many people that love the Lord here there's just those qualities that sneak in that aren't as positive as we like that.
[time=654] That's right and some of that just dictated by the influence of an ungodly culture on us though we could even identify it and say we don't want it to be that way.
[time=663] It does, it impacts us and we're not as strong as we could be.
[time=666] And then of course as we move through these first couple of chapters and we'll get to the end of the age and some of the exciting explosive topics that really as we look around us today I was reading Newsweek this morning and they were talking about the end of the world as the space and asteroids and things flying by the earth and missing us just barely.
[time=688] They anticipate, they're talking about the end of the age scientifically and so it seems to all be very curious and fascinating as you read the word of God.
[time=698] Well I'd like to remind our viewers again that you need to stay tuned each week because this is a very important series in the book of Revelation and very pertinent to the Christian and the end times.
[time=710] We're going to be sending you a letter in just a few days that should arrive in your home explaining to you the need financially that we have in the Bible hour.
[time=719] We're so thankful for the Founders Club and the number of people that write and faithfully give each month to support this ministry and we don't ask for money very often but we have a need to finish in the black this year and also to purchase some new equipment.
[time=735] From time to time our equipment just simply wears out.
[time=738] A number of pieces of equipment are over 10 years old and we need to just be sure that we're up to date with our equipment so we can function from week to week.
[time=747] So we're anticipating purchasing some new equipment as God places it upon your heart to give to the Bible hour during this year in time
[time=756] and I hope you'll respond as you receive that letter from us.
[time=759] And then just before we go back to the live portion of our service I want to remind you of the booklet that we're offering, Christ in Christmas, a family Advent celebration.
[time=768] If you'll just write to us today, we'll send you that book.
[time=772] You can receive it by writing to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=782] Once again, that's the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=792] That book actually is designed for the four weeks prior to Christmas but you can put it together if you write to us right away and you can still use it for your family time.
[time=803] There's scripture, there's some poems and some readings and even some choruses.
[time=807] Just a real important series of little messages telling us the real purpose for the Christmas season and why Christ came.
[time=818] We'll go back to the live portion of our service now.
[time=820] I hope you'll stay with us.
[time=842] (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music) (Music)
[time=901] (Music)
[time=1082] Thank you, reflection. Beautifully done.
[time=1086] Let's take our Bibles this morning and return to our ongoing study in the book of Revelation.
[time=1093] We come this morning to the second chapter.
[time=1097] And we will consider verses eight, nine, ten, and eleven.
[time=1102] It is the church at Smyrna, or the letter, or the message to the church at Smyrna.
[time=1109] Follow along as I read these four verses to you.
[time=1113] Revelation chapter two, verse eight.
[time=1116] And to the angel of the church at Smyrna, right, the first and the last, who was dead and has come to life says this.
[time=1126] I know your tribulation and your poverty, but you are rich.
[time=1131] And the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan, verse ten.
[time=1139] Do not fear what you are about to suffer.
[time=1142] Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days.
[time=1149] Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. He who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the churches.
[time=1159] He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.
[time=1164] This is a somewhat unique or distinctive letter of the seven.
[time=1168] First of all, it is the shortest of all the seven letters, just these four verses.
[time=1173] Secondly, Smyrna was clearly the most beautiful of all the seven cities addressed in this book.
[time=1180] Thirdly, of all the seven cities, it is only Smyrna that exists even to this day.
[time=1187] Ismer in modern Turkey is its name.
[time=1190] Now it's a thriving city of about 300,000 people.
[time=1194] All the other cities have long since disappeared.
[time=1197] Fourthly, it is the only city out of two, or the only churches of the seven, this one in Philadelphia, that have no condemnation included in the letter.
[time=1209] As Christ looks at these churches and he reviews them, in five of them he finds reason to rebuke them.
[time=1216] This is one of the churches where there is no rebuke given.
[time=1220] And it seems rather obvious as to why.
[time=1224] As we read it, you notice the word tribulation and poverty, and suffering, and being tested, and being faithful, even while put in prison and all the way until death.
[time=1237] This is a church that is under enormous persecution, and that testing and tribulation is having its perfect work, and that shouldn't surprise us.
[time=1246] Even as James says, "In James 1, consider it all joy, my brethren, when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance, and let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect, complete, lacking in nothing."
[time=1263] There is a dynamic that is a part of the spiritual world that when true believers are put under the test and under tribulation, it doesn't defeat their faith, it purifies it, it refines it,
[time=1275] and they come out the other side of it stronger than they ever were before.
[time=1279] And for reasons through this tribulation, whatever might have been in this church that Christ would have said negatively about it or rebuked for it, have been weaned out of it, have been taken out of it by this great tribulation and persecution.
[time=1294] The threat, the actual threats that they were facing in this particular church were one, social ostracization.
[time=1301] And then poverty, real abject poverty, and then imprisonment and eventually death.
[time=1308] That kind of pressure has a way of weeding out all the spiritual lightweights in any given church.
[time=1315] Hippocrates don't stay long when that kind of stuff starts to attack the church.
[time=1320] The Christian socialites find a different place to socialize, the phonies disappear.
[time=1326] With them goes all the false teachers and the false prophets, because they don't believe enough in what they're teaching to undergo this kind of persecution, so they exit as well, and they take with them their false doctrine, which would hamper any true believing church.
[time=1343] It is only the genuine believer that is left.
[time=1346] It is only the true believer that will fight its way through and subject itself to this kind of torture and pain and even death for their love of Christ.
[time=1360] After last week's message on the church at Ephesus, the church that had left its first love, friend of mine in this church, said to me, "You know, I appreciate what you said, and it meant a lot to me, I'm thankful for it."
[time=1373] But there was something in there you said that I'm not sure I agree with.
[time=1377] I said, "Really? Join the crowd." No, I didn't say that.
[time=1380] I said, "Really? What?" And he said, "Well, you were talking about how you believe that 90% of us or most of us or the vast majority of us, if put to a test because of our conviction for the truth, would get up and walk out the door and be burned at the stake rather than renounce Christ."
[time=1401] And he said, "I'd like to think that's true of our church, but I don't know if it really is."
[time=1408] And we stood there a minute longer and then he said something that I respect him for, really just being honest with himself.
[time=1412] He said, "You know, on fact, I'm not even sure I would. What would you do? What would you do if your faith was put to the test, this kind of extreme test where you either renounce Christ or die?"
[time=1437] To put this in perspective, keep your finger here in Revelation. Will you? And come with me to Matthew, Matthew chapter 10.
[time=1445] Jesus has summoned his twelve disciples.
[time=1453] And he is now going to send them out to do the work of evangelism.
[time=1457] Matthew chapter 10, verse 1, "And having summoned his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every kind of disease.
[time=1466] And every kind of sickness." And the rest of this chapter, he goes on to talk to them about what he wants them to do and how he wants them to respond and what their ministry is going to be like.
[time=1476] In verse 7, he tells them what they're supposed to preach.
[time=1479] And as you go, preach, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is at hand." Give credential to your preaching by verse 8, "Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out the demons, freely you have received, freely give."
[time=1493] This is a powerful, wonderful healing ministry of the forgiving grace of God that they would proclaim and then prove to those who listened that they were of God by the various miracles that they would perform.
[time=1502] And you would expect that they would have been greeted and warmly welcomed and thanked and appreciated and honored for this great ministry.
[time=1509] But no, look at verse 22.
[time=1513] He says, "But you will be hated by all on account of my name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved."
[time=1525] That's the same truth. He's saying to the church at Smyrna, "If your faith is real and genuine and is true, you'll walk it all the way through to the end of death and you'll still be found faithful. You won't recant."
[time=1537] Verse 23, "But when they persecute you in this city, flee to the next, for truly I say to you, you shall not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes."
[time=1548] He says, "When they reject you and they start to persecute you, go to the next city and then the next city and then the next city, but he knows that eventually they'll run out of cities."
[time=1555] The persecution will catch up with them.
[time=1558] Verse 28, "It'll be a box canyon, if you will, there'll be nowhere to run.
[time=1563] Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell, namely God.
[time=1574] Don't fear these men who can take your life, fear me, fear God because he can take your life and your soul."
[time=1581] And then where we're really headed here in verse 32 and 33, look at what he says.
[time=1587] "Everyone therefore who shall confess me before men, I will also confess before my father who is in heaven, but whoever shall deny me before men, I will also deny him before my father who is in heaven."
[time=1605] Christ will not claim you in heaven if you will not claim him on earth.
[time=1610] If Christ does not claim you in heaven, you don't go there.
[time=1615] If Christ says he does not know you, Matthew 7, you are sent out to the place of eternal torture.
[time=1625] It's very clear. Now this is not a work salvation.
[time=1628] This doesn't mean you've got to work your way to heaven by confessing him even under persecution.
[time=1632] No, not at all. The absolute opposite is true.
[time=1635] What it's confirming is genuine true faith in Christ, and people who have really come to faith in Christ will confess him in that moment.
[time=1644] And he will confess them in heaven.
[time=1648] You know, we in America have trouble with this because we think, at least I do, that persecution is something that happened at the beginning of the church.
[time=1660] Persecution is something that happened to Christ and they were still angry at Christ.
[time=1664] And so it kind of ran on into the New Testament church and it was an explosive beginning and it was a new thing.
[time=1670] And people hadn't come accustomed to it yet and they were somewhat abrasive because they were new.
[time=1675] And all that persecution was really just back then.
[time=1679] We know so little of it, persecution I mean, by virtue of the fact that we live in America.
[time=1685] But I want you to know that persecution is normative even as it says in Matthew 10.
[time=1690] They're going to hate you for my name's sake. Expect it. And this is how to respond to it.
[time=1696] If you'll think about your lifetime and let's think of the last just 70 years in world history.
[time=1702] Do you realize that most of the people on this planet who have named the name of Christ have suffered this kind of persecution?
[time=1708] We are the oddballs. We are the exception to the rule. We are atypical.
[time=1713] Persecution in the last 70 years in this world is typical for believers.
[time=1719] Think of the billion people that live in China.
[time=1723] They estimate a church of some 50 million there that is hot and thriving and pure and strong and aggressive
[time=1731] because it is under this kind of persecution.
[time=1733] I remember being in China and going with Dr. Bob Provost to visit the Chinese woman there.
[time=1739] She was a lawyer and a professor of law at this university that I won't name.
[time=1746] And in order for us to get to her house one night we had to take a series of different buses and taxis
[time=1752] and walks and then through different buildings and the whole thing was to try to make sure we weren't being followed.
[time=1758] We were being led by a guide, another woman who was stationed in Hong Kong and moves in and out of China
[time=1764] for the purpose of encouraging the church underground in China and she led us to this woman.
[time=1770] It was probably an hour and a half ordeal to get what would normally have taken us ten minutes just to drive over there.
[time=1776] Why? Because if she were discovered at that level as having faith in Jesus Christ and if we who were missionaries would reveal that
[time=1787] in a way that didn't need to be revealed she would have gone under incredible persecution.
[time=1792] She would have lost her job. She would have been unable to pay for her home with her family and who knows what would have occurred.
[time=1799] If you want to talk about Russia and what used to be Eastern Europe and the millions and millions and millions of people
[time=1805] that have been under that incredible opposition to God, they have been forced fed atheism and now the doors start to open
[time=1815] and out of the doors come the stories of what has been happening to the pastors there and to the Christians there.
[time=1821] They have been living under the constant pressure of persecution.
[time=1825] Christ experienced it. The early church experienced it. They experienced it.
[time=1830] Paul said in 2 Timothy 3 12 that indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[time=1838] It's normative Christian experience. We are the ones because we have been blessed to live in America that don't understand that.
[time=1845] And the thought of persecution really in this country to get persecuted so far you almost got to be weird.
[time=1851] You got to be odd. You almost have to aggravate it because our country has extended such remarkable religious freedom.
[time=1857] I'm not sure that's going to continue.
[time=1859] I'm not sure at all that in my lifetime or the lifetime of my children that that kind of religious freedom is going to exist in our country.
[time=1868] Just this week I was meeting with some of our elders and deacons and some men in our church and we were discussing some things
[time=1875] about our church. One of which was church discipline and the truth laid out in the Word of God in Matthew 18 as to how to pursue fallen brothers in your church and bring them back to repentance.
[time=1886] One of the men in the meeting is an attorney. He's a member of our church and also attorney in our city and he had done a remarkable job in researching the trend in America and speaking with other attorneys who had devoted their lives to this kind of investigation and religious rights.
[time=1903] He warned us. He said if you go about this and by the way he said and I believe we need to go about this exactly as the Bible teaches it unequivocally.
[time=1913] But he said I want you to know as an attorney not as legal counsel we weren't hiring him he's just one of us.
[time=1919] I want you to know that if you proceed in this direction it is likely very likely that you will be persecuted for it in the form of lawsuits.
[time=1932] And as a group of men in a preliminary way trying to discuss and weigh the options and realize that we were now moving into an era in this country drastically different than previous days were just to obey the simple commands of Scripture now may bring legal action against this church.
[time=1950] And all the weird stuff that would be maligned of us by the press etc etc etc. I'm not sure where we're headed and so with that just as I'm sure in your own heart you see trends in your world that lead you possibly to that same kind of concern about our future.
[time=1971] We look at the church at Smyrna and we will learn from them this morning how the church of Christ responds to persecution.
[time=1979] What God expects of us Revelation chapter two.
[time=1985] As is our custom when studying each one of these churches will look at it along seven points because there is no condemnation of Smyrna will have only six because that point doesn't exist.
[time=1997] These six points this morning are as follows the correspondent the city the church the commendation the command and then the council.
[time=2007] Let's go through these one by one first the correspondent who's writing this letter look at verse eight.
[time=2013] And to the angel of the church in Smyrna right the first and the last who was dead and has come to life says this your author your correspondent is Christ.
[time=2026] And as I've shared with you it is characteristic of him to draw for his title from the vision he gave him of himself in chapter one.
[time=2034] And he selects there out of verses 17 and 18 in chapter one of that vision do not be afraid.
[time=2041] I am the first and the last I am the eternal one I there never was a time when I wasn't and there never be a time when I'm not verse 18 and the living one and I was dead.
[time=2052] And behold I am alive forevermore and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
[time=2058] To a church that is on the edge of being thrown in prison and losing its life for the gospel being put to death for its faith in Christ he says to them remember I am the one who was dead and have come to life.
[time=2073] In essence I have experienced everything you're going to experience I know what it's like to be persecuted I know what it's like to be put to death and I also know what it's like to be brought back to life by the power of God.
[time=2085] And the same power of God that brought me back to life will bring you back to life as your faith in Jesus Christ allows.
[time=2094] That is the joy that is the hope of the believer resurrection.
[time=2100] So he identifies with them and in that gives them great encouragement and builds credibility to be listened to as he gives them counsel in what follows.
[time=2110] Secondly the city the city I mentioned to you that it's noted as the most beautiful city in all of Asia minor it was in that day.
[time=2118] It's about 35 miles north of Ephesus if Ephesus is here in the Aegean Sea wraps this way or actually up and around then Smyrna is about 35 miles north of Ephesus and in fact all these seven churches are really the route of the ancient postal district of that day.
[time=2136] And if you know just regular general male was going to be sent around it would go in this exact clockwise fashion as these churches are listed in the book for us.
[time=2145] And you'll notice it says in verse eight and to the angel of the church at Smyrna and I've suggested to you that that word could have been translated messenger or church leader which I believe it is.
[time=2156] Exactly seven leaders one from each one of these churches went across the Aegean Sea to the island Pat Moss where John was exiled to receive the only copy of this book the book of Revelation.
[time=2168] They would have then returned back and started in Ephesus all seven of them would have returned there they would have made a copy of that book handwritten copy of it.
[time=2178] They would then have the one guy from Ephesus stayed right there and six others moved along the route and each time they drop a guy at each city because that was his home that's where he would stay and the remaining guys would carry that letter on to the next cities.
[time=2192] But this is a as it was described to me as I read and studied about it a beautiful city.
[time=2199] This was a city that had the privilege of being right on the edge of a gorgeous harbor that was unusually deep.
[time=2207] And the rolling hills came off the ocean until it was cradled by a mountain some 500 feet high and up the face of this mountain kind of looped or laced a road they called the street of gold.
[time=2218] And along that road there would have been businesses and shops and excuse me until they finally came to the top of the building or excuse me the top of the mountain.
[time=2227] And there were all the stately public buildings sitting across the top of this mountain.
[time=2232] And it actually looked like the crown of Smyrna in fact that's what they called it the city was cradled by this mountain and on the top of the mountain were these beautiful buildings which capture the eye of all who would come and visit.
[time=2244] At the one side of the mountain was the temple sibil which was also very beautiful on the other the temple Zeus.
[time=2252] Apollo was another temple there and Aphrodite so this city was given over to paganism it was a beautiful city and it was a prosperous city.
[time=2260] And somehow existing in that city was the true church people of faith in Christ.
[time=2266] Now all we know about the church at Smyrna is in these four verses.
[time=2270] This is it there's no record of them in the book of Acts there's no mention of them anywhere else in the New Testament everything we know about this church is right here in these four verses.
[time=2278] We assume that it came into existence by the ministry of the Apostle Paul when he was an Ephesus for some three years.
[time=2284] Acts 19 says that his preaching from Ephesus was heard all over Asia this is obviously in that vicinity.
[time=2290] So some people may have been on business from Smyrna in Ephesus came to Christ and brought the gospel back.
[time=2296] Or they may have sent missionaries out to Smyrna we don't know but it's likely that it came into existence to the preaching and teaching ministry of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2304] We learn more about the church under the heading their commendation.
[time=2308] What does Christ say about that? What are they noted for?
[time=2312] How does he congratulate them or strengthen them and that's found in verse nine.
[time=2316] This is really interesting look at this verse nine.
[time=2320] I know your tribulation and your poverty but you are rich and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not but are a synagogue of Satan.
[time=2332] The word tribulation it means pressure I know the pressure that you're under.
[time=2338] It's used other places in the New Testament to describe the calamities of war or the distress of starvation or the pain of a woman in childbirth.
[time=2349] In other words this is an absolutely preoccupying tribulation.
[time=2352] This isn't something that nags you as you try to get on with your life. This is your life.
[time=2357] This tribulation is all consuming.
[time=2360] You say why? Why do they have this tribulation? Why not the other churches? Why didn't Ephesus have this tribulation?
[time=2366] Well the answer to that is this, Smyrna had a long tradition with Rome.
[time=2372] Through the many civil wars that went on inside the Roman Empire, Smyrna somehow managed to always stay on the winning side and so they had a growing allegiance to Rome.
[time=2381] And in 195 B.C. they built there the great temple dias Romanas which means Rome is divine and it was the beginning in Asia minor of worshiping Rome as a government.
[time=2395] Some years later they began to fall in line with a commitment to emperor worship as Caesar soon took on deity status and made to be worshiped.
[time=2406] And by the time this letter is written and shortly thereafter this is all coming to culmination in the development of this kind of evolutionary cycle in Smyrna as people move towards emperor worship.
[time=2416] It came to a head and this is it. If you were a believer, in fact everybody in Smyrna had to go to the magistrate once a year.
[time=2425] And in the presence of that magistrate they had to say these words, Caesar is Lord.
[time=2433] Once a year you'd go down to the city hall, stand before whoever it was presiding in that particular session, you'd have to stand up and say these words.
[time=2443] Caesar is Lord. Without that certificate you were marked.
[time=2452] And apparently the type of opposition and tribulation that came to them was primarily financial. Look again at verse 9.
[time=2458] I know your tribulation and your poverty, there are two Greek words in the New Testament for poverty.
[time=2463] One of them, Kenea means that you're not rich, you have nothing superfluous, you have no extras, you have enough for your basic needs.
[time=2472] It's kind of hand to mouth kind of poverty. But the other word in the New Testament, Tokos, is I have nothing at all.
[time=2480] I struggle just to survive. I struggle just to have enough sustenance to live yet another day.
[time=2487] That's the word he uses here. So the picture that emerges in our understanding of this kind of tribulation is this.
[time=2494] As emperor worship increased in that city, they had to go and say Caesar is Lord. The Christian wouldn't do that. He didn't have the certificate, which meant that he was a marked person or she was a marked person in that city.
[time=2506] And therefore they were shunned by the people of that city until they finally fell into abject poverty. Think about it, you who own businesses and are dependent upon your businesses to finance your debt and the whole thing we call capitalism and building and moving ahead.
[time=2521] You don't have a certificate quietly, but noticeably your business starts to fall off and you're unable to meet your debt service.
[time=2531] You're unable to handle the requirements that are there and you default and they take not just your business, but the assets you use to secure that business.
[time=2542] And for those of you who don't own businesses, those of you who work for other people, you're capable, you're intelligent, you're contributing, but you don't have a certificate.
[time=2550] And with time you are found out and they find ways to get you out of employment and you find that you can get only the lowest paying jobs if any inside the city.
[time=2562] So over a period of time, and by the way, this is a progressive tribulation, this in my mind would be so much harder than having somebody come up to me and say denounce Christ or I blow your head off.
[time=2572] You know, that's a one-time shot. I'm in heaven. Try living and watching your life and everything you've worked for and everything you care about start kind of just dwindling and falling away.
[time=2582] Year after year after year until you come to abject poverty and the feelings of guilt you would have in your inability to provide for your family and wondering did I do the right thing?
[time=2593] Should I have just said Caesar is Lord? Unbelievable pressure. Unbelievable tribulation.
[time=2601] And it was agitated by the Jews. Look at verse nine.
[time=2605] And the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not but in fact are a synagogue of Satan.
[time=2611] The word blasphemy, it's translated that way in my Bible. Maybe it's slander in your Bible. It could be either.
[time=2617] Typically what is going on here is they are slandering the Christians and early in the persecution we know from church history the kind of slander that the Jew would bring against the believer.
[time=2627] They would accuse them of being cannibals because we eat the flesh and drink the blood in communion.
[time=2633] They would accuse and slander them as being a very lustful and wanting people because we greet each other with a holy kiss and celebrate the love feasts.
[time=2643] They would accuse the Christians of being home records or home destroyers because when one of these family members would come to Christ out of this pagan culture and begin to live for Christ it would destroy their celebrations.
[time=2655] It would destroy their holidays and it may destroy their family and so they would accuse and persecute them because they were home records.
[time=2663] But ultimately this thing culminates in their being called atheists because you are an atheist unless you said Caesar is Lord.
[time=2672] And then also rebellion and political disloyalty.
[time=2679] So they eventually these Jews became informants to the Roman government and to those who were most zealous in the worship of the emperor.
[time=2686] And they would as informants signify and point out who the Christians were in their area or in their place of work or in their location of living that didn't worship Caesar.
[time=2698] And those people would be delivered up to prison and eventually death.
[time=2702] So their situation is difficult. Notice what it's called. It's called a synagogue of Satan. That's interesting, isn't it?
[time=2709] Apparently these Jews were able to bow down and say Caesar is Lord and still hang on to some of their Judaism.
[time=2716] They still met in synagogues and it's reminiscent of John 1915 when Jesus Christ is being tried and just before his crucifixion and pilot says to the Jews that had gathered.
[time=2727] He said this is your king, the king of Israel. And they said we have no king but who? Caesar.
[time=2735] They were well trained in the art of maneuvering into the political arena in the city in which they lived.
[time=2742] They knew what to say. They knew how to exist and they were all the while denying the true God.
[time=2748] And so what Jesus says is this, you're not a synagogue of Judaism. You're a synagogue of Satan.
[time=2754] And here's the point, when the Jews rejected Christ, Judaism became Satanism.
[time=2760] When the Jews rejected their Lord and crucified him, Judaism became Satanism, which is true of any other religion in the world that doesn't honor and exalt Christ.
[time=2769] It's all just a synagogue of Satan or a temple of Satan. So he unmasks them, calls them what they are.
[time=2778] So you have tribulation, you have poverty. It's being aggravated by those who hate you in the Jews that search and seek you out to inform against you.
[time=2788] But in verse 9 he says you're rich. He says you're really rich. You have nothing but really you have everything.
[time=2796] What does he mean? Well, you're holy people. You're a mature people. You're a godly people.
[time=2805] You have your integrity. You didn't compromise what you said you believed.
[time=2810] Your love for Christ is not in question. Your life has focus and power. You're full of love and joy.
[time=2817] You have friends and you know who your friends are. Those who stand with you in the persecution.
[time=2822] You have divine resource in God and you have a sympathetic Savior who by his own death and resurrection guarantees your own resurrection after your death.
[time=2830] You have everything. You're rich. And so he encourages them in that way.
[time=2837] Now let's go to verse 10 and look at the command. If that's the commendation, what is the command? What's he telling them to do?
[time=2844] Look at it. Do not fear what you are about to suffer.
[time=2848] What? Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tested.
[time=2854] And you will have tribulation 10 days. Be faithful until death and I will give you the crown of life.
[time=2860] He says, don't fear and be faithful. That is his command. Don't fear them and be faithful.
[time=2868] You know, at this point, after all they've suffered. They've lost all their possessions.
[time=2872] They've been socially ostracized. You'd like them to come in and say, and by the way, it's over now.
[time=2876] You've done well. We're going to make the situation easier for you. But no, instead it's going to get harder.
[time=2881] It's going to become intensified. It's going to go from poverty and social ostracism to imprisonment and death.
[time=2890] But don't fear it. Be faithful to me.
[time=2896] I don't know. Do you think about that?
[time=2899] In studying the passage and the conversation I had stimulates my mind and I think of the great testing in the Old Testament.
[time=2906] That of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. These three young youths, these three young boys, I don't have three young boys.
[time=2913] I have four young daughters. And I think of them out there at times on that plane of Dura.
[time=2920] I think of them out there with all those people representative of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom that have been drawn there from all the nations of the world and this great image that he had built and he's trying to unify his people and he's demanding that they worship him and the great Babylon.
[time=2934] And he had said to all those youth and all those people, if you do not bow down when you hear the orchestra do their big sound thing, you're going to be thrown in that fiery furnace.
[time=2943] And I picture my daughters there. And if I could be there and not be there, like I could whisper in their ear and not be seen.
[time=2954] And that orchestra is getting ready to do their big noise.
[time=2959] What are you going to whisper in their ear?
[time=2963] What are you going to say?
[time=2966] I'd like to think I'd kind of reach over and say don't you dare bow down.
[time=2975] Don't you dare bow down to that guy.
[time=2981] And then if they didn't and they were grabbed by the soldiers as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were and taken in front of the very furnace and were given a second opportunity to decry their God and to denounce him.
[time=2994] And they were in the very presence of the fire.
[time=2997] And you know what Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego said they said our God is able to deliver us from the fire and if not, they didn't bind God to deliver them from that.
[time=3009] They were fully aware they may burn up that day.
[time=3012] And if not, we will not bow down and worship you, O King Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=3019] What would it feel like to watch your kids walk into that fiery furnace that had their life consumed?
[time=3026] I think we'd be filled with tears of joy.
[time=3030] Tears of joy because they had stood strong.
[time=3033] They had died with integrity.
[time=3035] They had named Christ and lived Christ.
[time=3037] It may be your proudest moment in life.
[time=3042] Well, at the same time, your eyes would no doubt be filled with tears of sadness as you saw the torture that they went through
[time=3049] and the trauma and the loss of relationship.
[time=3052] I believe that when you and I stand strong, it's as if our Heavenly Father is up there whispering in our ear, "Don't you dare, don't you dare bend down." And when He sees us walk faithfully to the place of death, it may be His greatest moment, His greatest joy
[time=3069] as He can see our faith being proven and real and genuine, knowing that life is but a vapor that He'll resurrect us and that we'll spend forever with Him
[time=3080] in the glory of knowing that we did not bow down.
[time=3084] Let me say it again, persecution and trials and hardship will always destroy false faith.
[time=3091] But that same stuff, persecution and hardship and trials will always strengthen and confirm and reveal genuine faith.
[time=3102] It's never any other way.
[time=3105] So the correspondent, the city, the church, the commendation, the command, do not fear, be faithful and lastly the counsel.
[time=3115] Look at it here, in verse 11, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches,
[time=3124] and he who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death." The second death is called hell.
[time=3131] "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says." In other words, He's pleading, "Believe me, you can trust me."
[time=3141] What I'm saying to you is right when they want you to bow down, don't fear Him and be faithful.
[time=3147] Die for the name of Christ.
[time=3150] Listen to what I'm saying, He pleads with them.
[time=3153] There was a man who did, there were many who did, in church history, one by the name of Polycarp.
[time=3159] I want to just read you an excerpt from a letter that was sent from the Church of Smyrna to the other six churches
[time=3166] after Polycarp's martyrdom.
[time=3170] This is her excerpt taken from that letter.
[time=3175] It was the time of the public games.
[time=3178] The city was crowded and the crowds were excited.
[time=3182] Suddenly the shout went up away with the atheists.
[time=3186] Let Polycarp be searched for.
[time=3189] He was a great leader of that church.
[time=3192] His whereabouts were betrayed to the persecutors by a little slave girl who collapsed under torture as they came to arrest him.
[time=3202] Not even the soldiers' captain wished to see Polycarp die.
[time=3206] On the brief journey to the city, he pled to the old man, quote, "What harm is it to say Caesar is Lord and to sacrifice and save your life?"
[time=3217] But Polycarp was adamant that for him only Jesus Christ was Lord.
[time=3224] He entered the arena.
[time=3226] There the pro council gave him the choice of cursing the name of Christ and making sacrifice to Caesar or death.
[time=3234] "80 and six years I have served him," said Polycarp.
[time=3238] "And he has done me no wrong.
[time=3240] How can I blaspheme my king who saved me?" The pro council threatened him with burning.
[time=3247] Polycarp replied.
[time=3249] "You threaten me with the fire that burns for a time and is quickly quenched.
[time=3253] For you do not know the fire which awaits the wicked in the judgment that comes and in the everlasting punishment.
[time=3260] Why are you waiting?
[time=3262] Come do what you will!" He taunts them.
[time=3268] He remained unmovable.
[time=3270] The crowds came flocking with their sticks from the work at place, from the baths and the Jews, even although they were breaking the Sabbath law by carrying such burdens were foremost in the clamor and bringing wood for the fire.
[time=3287] They were going to bind him to the stake.
[time=3290] He responded.
[time=3292] "Leave me as I am," he said, "for he who gives me power to endure the fire will grant me to remain in the flames unmoved, even without the security you will give by binding."
[time=3306] So they left him loosely in the flames, and there he died for Christ.
[time=3313] Amen?
[time=3315] So it is for him, so it was for him, and so it may be for us.
[time=3322] Make resolve in your heart today to claim Christ as Lord and none other,
[time=3330] no matter what it may cost you or your family.
[time=3336] Let's pray it again.
[time=3340] Father, thank you for the testimony of these noble Christians in Smyrna.
[time=3346] Thank you for the commitment that they had to Christ willing to suffer tribulation
[time=3352] and imprisonment and for some even death.
[time=3357] Father, make us bold for Christ.
[time=3362] Grant us the strength and the courage and the growth and the perspective and the wisdom to be completely and totally committed to the person of Christ, to have him as our Lord, totally and completely, under his sovereign power,
[time=3378] that should the day come, whether it be tomorrow with a neighbor or a business associate, that in appropriate ways and ways that are sensitive to the situation,
[time=3389] are real willingness in our hearts to name Christ as Lord, or should it come in sometime in this country's future for us to be tested even at the stake that we would name Christ above all others and none other.
[time=3408] In whose name we pray, amen.
