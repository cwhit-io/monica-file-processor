[time=0] And to the angel of the church in Sardis right, he who has the seven spirits of God and the
[time=7] seven stars says this, I know your deeds that you have a name that you are alive, but you
[time=16] are dead.
[time=19] This is the dead church.
[time=20] This church is not alive.
[time=23] This church is dead.
[time=24] Now it has a reputation for life.
[time=26] You see, he says that I know your deeds and that you have a name that you are alive.
[time=31] In other words, there was a time when you were alive and active and vibrant in your faith and that those deeds brought you a reputation, but since that time, though your reputation
[time=42] lingers as calling you alive, you are in fact dead.
[time=56] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=63] you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=65] Thank you for joining us.
[time=66] Have you ever been at a church where you had the feeling the church was dead?
[time=70] It had a pastor, a choir, a people in the pew, even programs for children, but somehow the church still seemed dead.
[time=77] Today as we continue our study in the book of Revelation, we'll examine the dead church at Sardis.
[time=82] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation.
[time=86] We'll be looking at chapter 3 verses 1 through 6.

[time=690] >>We have had some changes this year.
[time=692] Scott and Lisa have moved to Salem Indiana where Scott is the pastor of the Christian Life Baptist Church.
[time=698] They're really excited about what they're doing as this is their first pastorate and they have seen quite a bit of growth in the last couple of months.
[time=707] Peter has moved to Chicago he's with a mutual funds company and he works in their correspondence department.
[time=713] The children have moved away as of last summer but we'll all be together again for Christmas and I'm really looking forward to that.

[time=754] What are some of your responsibilities?
[time=756] >>Thanks Pete.
[time=758] My biggest responsibility is getting the church decorated for the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=763] We start about two weeks before the first performance and there's just a lot of hours.
[time=769] I think that we both live here probably from 9 to 11 every day until the tree is up then
[time=775] I have the privilege of singing in the tree and how I enjoy that that's one of my favorite things and of course Christmas is one of my favorite times of the year.
[time=784] >>We go over the music from July it seems or even before that in our whole and are you
[time=790] still enjoying some of the music what might be your favorite song?
[time=793] >>Well one of my very favorite is Carol of the Bells and that starts the program off this year then we have Little Drummer Boy and then we go back to some of the favorite Carols.
[time=802] We have old come all you faithful and little town of Bethlehem.
[time=805] >>Well again it takes its toll on us physically to do the Living Christmas Tree but I'm really
[time=811] thankful that my family is involved with it and that really gives me a great sense of satisfaction that all through the year all of my kids and especially my wife see the same ministry that I have with the Living Christmas Tree and we're really thankful for those of you that could come and be with us.

[time=1198] Christmas tree and just does a phenomenal job with it and then leads everybody in a couple of Christmas carols and we're so thankful for Brian and for his ministry in our church.
[time=1208] Let's take our Bibles again this morning and open it to the book of Revelation and if you are here visiting us today I want you to know that we're studying this book moving through it paragraph by paragraph covering each chapter and listening to the mind of God as he develops his thought in this wonderful book about the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=1229] We're in chapters two and three we'll begin this morning in chapter three verse one but the setting is Christ is examining seven churches, seven literal historical actual churches that
[time=1240] were about 90 AD living in Asia Minor and we've examined four of them and come this morning
[time=1247] to the fifth church the church at Sardis. We'll do that this morning and then next Sunday we'll break from our study of Revelation for a special Christmas message and then after Christmas go back and pick up churches six and seven. Let's begin verse one and to the
[time=1263] angel of the church in Sardis right he who has the seven spirits of God and the seven
[time=1269] stars says this I know your deeds that you have a name that you are alive but you are
[time=1277] dead. This is a church that has a reputation for life but in fact is dead. There was a
[time=1286] time when their deeds as referenced in verse one gave them a reputation as alive and active
[time=1292] and vibrant but that has since stopped and though the reputation lingers they are in fact dead. Astronomers tell us that it takes the light from a star to reach the earth about
[time=1304] 33 years which means that a star could have plunged itself into darkness some 30 years
[time=1311] ago and we still wouldn't know it we'd look up there and think the star is still there because the light from that star is still traveling towards the earth so it was with the church at Sardis. It had long since died it had long since emitted stopped emitting
[time=1326] light and giving life but all that remained was the memory of it and the reputation of
[time=1332] it. Now I want as we begin to bring a point of clarification on what the Lord means when
[time=1338] he calls this a dead church. Some churches we view as being dead because they don't have our style of worship and they are liturgical in form and they're boring to our tastes
[time=1349] and preferences. The thing just kind of seems to drone on you feel more like you're at a funeral than you are at a church service and he's not talking about that. That is a legitimate
[time=1358] style of worship and as long as the people there have hearts that are alive in Jesus Christ and that's a living church. He's not talking about a form of worship. He's also not talking about the kind of dead church that may be out on sometimes called dead I think improperly on some country corner that is in a community that isn't growing in numbers
[time=1379] and it's just a small little country church and it hasn't built any new buildings and it hasn't grown and its membership isn't rising and it's just doing its little work.
[time=1388] There's nothing dead about that church in and of itself. They may be doing a very significant work for the cause of Christ with the resources they have and the number of people they have to reach. So we need to think clearly about deadness. Deadness in the New Testament is
[time=1403] always related to sin. Sin that is left undelt with. Ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 and you
[time=1410] were dead in your trespasses and sins because the sin and the life of those people had not
[time=1417] been dealt with they are dead spiritually. Colossians 2 verse 13 and you were dead in
[time=1423] your transgressions. The church at Sardis is dead because they're not dealing with sin in the sense of being born again people coming to Christ. The church is full of unsaved people.
[time=1436] The church is full of people who are unregenerate who have never come to Christ. If we were to give them a name they would be best titled the first church of the tears. There is no wheat there or very little of it. The characteristic grouping of this church are people who have
[time=1452] never been saved, who are not regenerated by the Spirit of God and therefore are spiritually dead. Like the rhyme of the ancient Mariner, corpses man the ship, dead men pull the oars,
[time=1463] dead men hoist the sails and dead men steer the vessel. So it was at the church of Sardis,
[time=1469] corpses filled the church, dead men line the pews, dead men sing the songs and dead men preach the sermons. They are dead spiritually. They are not alive to Christ. So that by way
[time=1482] of introduction and orientation to this notion of Christ's comment about them that they are dead. Let's follow the passage according to our little outline these seven points which we begin with the correspondent. In verse 1 Christ identifies himself as the author in
[time=1498] a most unusual way and to the angel of the church in Sardis right he who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says this. If you've been with us in this study that's
[time=1509] most unusual. This is a description of Christ. Why does he call himself as the one who has the seven spirits? We'll go to chapter 1 and look at verse 4 for a minute. Chapter 1 verse
[time=1520] 4 at the beginning there you've got a what we call a Trinitarian benediction. This is
[time=1526] grace and peace being offered by the Trinity. So each member is mentioned. Verse 4 John
[time=1533] to the seven churches that are in Asia. Here's the benediction grace to you and peace from
[time=1539] whom? Well from him who is and who was and who is to come that's God the Father and from
[time=1545] the seven spirits who are before his throne that's the Holy Spirit. It's an unusual way to refer to the Holy Spirit. We don't know exactly how to define that. Isaiah 11 gives us some help. Zachariah 4 we studied that in days past. We won't go over that again this morning. And then from Jesus Christ the faithful witnessed the firstborn of the dead.
[time=1565] So apparently Jesus Christ is describing himself in this introductory part of the letter as
[time=1571] the one who has the seven spirits or as the one who has the Holy Spirit. He also describes himself as the one who has the seven stars. Look at verse 20 of chapter 1. You remember
[time=1582] the seven stars? Verse 20 chapter 1 as for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw
[time=1588] in my right hand. Meaning he has control over them. The seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. I don't believe that's best translated angel.
[time=1600] The Greek word could be translated messenger. These would be the seven leaders of those seven churches. One from each church that crossed the Aegean Sea went to the island of Patmos to receive the only copy of the book of Revelation from John who was taking it direct from the Lord. These seven messengers went back across the Aegean Sea at the Asia miners started an Ephesus and made their way around that postal route each time making a copy of the letter and then the one messenger would stay and the six remaining would go on and so it went until we come to this church the church at Sardis. You see what's the Lord saying about himself? I mean how is this description of him now chapter 3 verse 1 relevant to the
[time=1639] church at Sardis? Well I don't know exactly. This is my guess. This is a dead church. They
[time=1645] have long since forfeited the ministry of the Holy Spirit there. It's not that the Holy
[time=1652] Spirit comes to Blackhawk Baptist Church and fills up the sanctuary. The Spirit of God comes to Blackhawk when you come to Blackhawk because you're born again and you are indwelt by the Spirit of God as am I and it is we who bring the Spirit of God in that sense to this church.
[time=1667] This is a dead church. This is a church at Sardis that doesn't have any regenerate people or very few and so the ministry of the Spirit of God has gone from them. It says also these
[time=1678] seven stars, these seven leaders. What I believe you may be saying there is that because you're dead the godly leadership the holy men the ones who would be devoted to Christ who come
[time=1689] among you to minister their spiritual gifts and to equip you for the work of the ministry of Ephesians 4, they too have left. And so I introduce you to myself to you as the one
[time=1700] with seven spirits of God the Holy Spirit and the leadership because that is the means through which I minister in the church and because you're dead you have forfeited those
[time=1711] and he begins to bring them into the knowledge of all they have forsaken. He's doing it rather
[time=1718] gently there. It's almost like Samson. Do you remember Samson? There are these shocking words of him. He knew not that the Lord had departed. Samson had marvelous strength and
[time=1729] with that strength had accomplished incredible phenomenal feats of great courage to deliver the nation of Israel from their enemies. But there was a point in his life where he had sinned to the point that the Lord left him. The Lord took the strength away from him and the blessing of his life. That didn't happen through the cutting of his locks. That was a mere emblematic reality. He allowed his hair to be cut in direct defiance to the word
[time=1753] of God and with that last act of obedience the Lord took the strength away. There was a time when Samson didn't even know that. He still thought he had the Lord and the Lord had departed. So it may have been with the church at Sardis and the Lord is bringing them into the knowledge that I no longer minister through and in you by the power of the Spirit of God and through Godly men. You're a dead church. We go from this to number two, the
[time=1776] city and this is interesting. The city itself is a commentary on the church or vice versa.
[time=1785] The city of Sardis at one point had been the leading city in the world under the Lydian dynasty back about 1500 years from the writing of this letter. The Lydian dynasty came into the power and Sardis was the place of choice for the kings and the rulers because of its
[time=1801] natural fortresses. If this is Asia Minor and if you're the Aegean Sea and Ephesus is
[time=1808] down over here and these other churches are running up and we come around to Sardis this would be the central part of Asia Minor and it was full of mountains and there was a mountain region that ran down into the Hermos Valley which was a beautiful fertile valley. Sardis
[time=1823] was stuck out on a peninsula of rock just almost like this stage and the only way to approach the city of Sardis was to come along this mountain road and come in through like a neck of land that would bring you to the plateau and the plateau was guarded by sheer cliffs of some 1500 feet in height before they descended into the Hermos Valley and
[time=1844] so for the Lydian kingdom this was where the king would reside because he was safe there.
[time=1851] It was almost impregnable but with time the Roman Empire conquered the Lydian dynasty
[time=1857] and Rome brought peace and so there was no shelter to be sought there was none needed and Sardis the city the plateau itself was rather small and couldn't expand as it needed to so the people migrated down to the foot of the mountain itself and there the real city began and grew and thrived and flourished and there became two cultures a new city culture
[time=1878] and an old city culture and Sardis eventually the the Sardis on top of the hill was was in
[time=1886] itself dead it was a relic it became a historical relic and people would go there to remember the past and there were a few people that lived there but in and of itself as far as
[time=1896] the thriving Roman Empire Sardis had died and so it is a commentary on the death of the
[time=1902] church that resides there you have a dead city and a dead church what about the church number
[time=1909] three we don't know again a lot about it all we know is what is in these six verses nothing is said about it in the book of Acts or the rest of the book of Revelation or in any of the epistles we can only assume that it began through the preaching ministry of the Apostle Paul Acts chapter 19 he was at Ephesus for some three and a half years the word went out people got saved some of those people may have been from Sardis they took the gospel back like seed and planted it and a church grew so this dead church some years ago vibrant
[time=1939] and strong it had a reputation it had been successful but it is no longer number four
[time=1946] is typically the commendation but in this letter it's the condemnation he skips over the commendation he just goes right over it to decry them for their spiritual deadness
[time=1958] verse one I know your deeds that you have a name that you're alive but you are dead
[time=1965] and that is a that is a tragic thing to say about a church a church is nothing less than
[time=1972] alive I mean a true church that's all we are we are a celebration of eternal life we
[time=1979] are those who have been dead but through the grace of God accepting Jesus Christ have been made alive and a service such as this one is only a celebration of life we are alive
[time=1989] the Spirit of God is within us and we come to listen and learn from the living word of God so that in the life empowered by us or in us through the Spirit of God we can live life in Fort Wayne that's all we are is life God lives here the Spirit of God lives here
[time=2004] Jesus lives here and we are dead people who have been brought to life who come to celebrate life this church was populated by dead people unregenerate people folks who had never come
[time=2015] to Christ people who had never been born again it was a defiled church it was full of inward
[time=2021] decay spiritual degeneration and dry rot they were full of spiritual dry rot they were dead
[time=2031] have you been in churches like that now again I'm not talking about a style of worship spiritually dead churches I have and it's odd oftentimes they have beautiful facilities they're well
[time=2045] kept and well laid out and you walk in and you notice that they have a pastor and you see where they are choir sings and you look on the bulletin board and you look at all the children's programs that are listed there and there's typically some philanthropic effort that they're involved in and they're oftentimes really promoting their history and their past
[time=2066] what they're dead you see what makes them dead what is that thing that makes them dead it's very simple they deny the miracle of rebirth in Christ they deny that oh they talk
[time=2083] about sin but they make it very generic it's the sin of the world instead of my sin and
[time=2090] your sin and our violation of the word of God they talk about a Savior but they talk about
[time=2096] that in very general terms it is the Savior that saved the sins of the world and he somehow
[time=2102] automatically saves everybody everybody somehow is saved especially if you're in the church
[time=2109] and so they rob the church of its power by taking away the vital union relationship of
[time=2115] individuals to an individual Savior named Jesus when they come to Christ based upon their own conviction of their sin once that's gone the church is dead once that's gone the
[time=2128] church is dead and that's what happened here do you remember the conversion of the apostle Paul he's going down that Damascus road incredibly religious man a zealot persecuting
[time=2141] the church and he has an encounter a personal encounter with Christ it blinds him and he
[time=2148] hits the deck he rises only when Christ tells him to and he spends the rest of his life serving the Lord Jesus Christ Galatians 220 this is his commentary then on the life that
[time=2159] he went on to live he says I have been crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ lives in me and the life that I now live I live by faith in the Son of God who loved
[time=2169] me and delivered himself up for me that's life folks that comes out of a personal encounter
[time=2177] with the person of Jesus Christ and he says is no longer me living I've surrendered my life I have come completely into the lordship of Jesus Christ he is my sovereign in fact
[time=2188] I can say it this way the life that I now live I don't live it Christ lives in and through
[time=2194] me when did all that happen and how does all that happen how come I'm alive because it's
[time=2200] Jesus Christ who delivered himself up for me somebody had to pay the price for my sin I'm alive today because somebody else died I can see spiritual truth because Christ died
[time=2211] and took away my sin and gives me life as soon as that is gone from a church that church
[time=2220] begins to die and suddenly sin is a general thing and salvation is a general thing and
[time=2228] generation after generation perpetuates itself until it's populated with dead people well
[time=2234] they're alive physically but they're dead spiritually what does he say to this church
[time=2241] look at verses two and three what's his counsel wake up and strengthen the things that remain
[time=2249] which were about to die for I have not found your deeds completed in the sight of my God remember therefore what you have received and heard and keep it and repent if therefore you will not wake up I will come like a thief and you will not know at what hour I will come
[time=2265] upon you you say who's he speaking to here is he speaking to the people in verse four but
[time=2272] you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments apparently there was a very small remnant still in this church this dead church of people who knew Christ is he talking to them or is he talking to everybody else in the church that's dead and there's some controversy on this and I'll suggest to you that he's giving this counsel to the unbelievers
[time=2291] I believe that because he threatens them like to come as the thief in the night that
[time=2297] picture is used in Matthew 24 Luke 12 1 Thessalonians 5 2 Peter 3 in Revelation 16 every
[time=2304] time it's used it describes the unexpected thief coming to do great harm and that's what
[time=2310] he is threatening to you unbelievers I am coming and I am coming unexpectedly and I will bring great harm listen to 1 Thessalonians 5 for you yourselves know full well that the day of the Lord will come just like a thief in the night while they are saying peace and safety then destruction will come upon them suddenly like birth pains and upon a woman
[time=2331] a woman with child and they shall not escape this is a harsh message of impending doom
[time=2339] and damnation I also think he's addressing it to the unsaved because it seems he's speaking
[time=2347] to the unsaved in verses 1 2 and 3 and then he shifts the focus to the believers with this word but in verse 4 this is what I have to say to you but you have a few people in Sardis who have not saw their garments so I take this counsel as being addressed to the
[time=2364] unbelievers now what is the counsel first of all wake up the word could have been translated to watch or be watchful I don't know if this is what the Lord had in his mind but there's
[time=2374] this obvious event in the history of Sardis that you can't escape when you see the word wake up or be watchful Cyrus the king of Persia was coming against the city of Sardis and
[time=2388] he came up that mountain road and tried to make his way into the city across this little neck of land and he was soundly defeated and took horrible losses so he went back retreated
[time=2398] and recouped while he may get another attempt at this side his real effort was over here
[time=2405] and he sent up the sheer cliffs it's one of these classic you know army attacks from behind deals and he sends these troops up this 1,500 foot sheer cliff and they get over the
[time=2416] edge and they wipe out the city from behind and for the first time in its history it falls
[time=2423] to the hands of an enemy and it was because nobody was watching it's because nobody was
[time=2430] even attending to the back side one historian said it this way so secure did the city of Sardis feel that they left this means of access completely unguarded permitting the climbers
[time=2441] to ascend unobserved it is said that even a child could have defended the city from this kind of attack but not so much as one observer had been appointed to watch he says to them
[time=2453] look you have already been devastated in the history of this city for lack of watchfulness
[time=2460] let me assure you there is another one coming another devastation coming it will be me like a thief in the night and don't make the same mistake twice be watchful be watchful of me
[time=2471] look for my coming he says then secondly and strengthen the things that remain in verse
[time=2477] two wake up and strengthen the things that remain the remaining things it appears that there are a few remaining graces in this church that would have been encapsulated in the hearts
[time=2488] and lives of these few believers that were there and he's saying look you're not totally wiped out yet there are still a few wheat among the tear strengthen what remains hang on to what is still right about your church seek these true believers out listen and learn from them and strengthen that in your church he goes on then to say in verse two for I have
[time=2510] not found your deeds completed in the sight of my god he's saying as a church you started well you had some deeds but you haven't completed the work I sent you to start us to do finish
[time=2520] it it'd be like a great composer or a great artist who'd begun a great work but was cut
[time=2526] off by death and the world is left to wonder what might have happened had that man or woman been able to finish their creative work he's saying you're not finished you haven't done what I sent you there to do strengthen what remains and complete what I sent you to do
[time=2541] then he gives counsel and keep it look at verse three remember therefore what you have received
[time=2547] and heard obviously through the preaching of the Apostle Paul and that first generation of godly believers and then keep it obey the word of God then he says repent do you realize
[time=2558] that that's where salvation begins salvation begins with repentance salvation begins with
[time=2565] the knowledge that I am a sinner that I deserve death and out of that plea of the heart to
[time=2572] find forgiveness the person looks into the forgiving arms of Christ and says he died for me let his death be my death for the wages of sin is death and I'm either going to die for my sins or Christ is and I accept the atoning work of Christ salvation doesn't begin with
[time=2588] a general notion of Jesus and if you just accept Jesus you can have a happy wonderful fulfilled
[time=2594] life that's not the gospel the gospel is never presented that way in the New Testament the
[time=2601] gospel comes after the conviction of sin the profound conviction of personal sin and that's
[time=2607] what he's calling for repent look at your life look at what you are and turn to Christ out of conviction for your sin the word repent means to change your mind a hundred and eighty degrees you were going this way go that way you were thinking you could live your own life you could establish your own ways you were okay without Christ absolutely change your mind go a hundred percent the opposite direction and say I am helpless needy sinful I must have Christ or I die
[time=2632] and that's what he calls for so these really outline a little process for revival don't they
[time=2640] because by waking up then strengthening what remains then completing which the things which God had given you by remembering and keeping the law and bringing people to repentance I wish
[time=2651] that what happened in America and I know America is not the church but wouldn't it be wonderful if America would wake up if America would recognize that tragedy is just around the corner catastrophe
[time=2663] is waiting as the country is caving in under its own immorality and then it would strengthen
[time=2669] itself in other words take a hold of the few remnants of the Judeo-Christian ethic that are still surviving in this country and then complete its task God raised this nation up like he has
[time=2681] other nations in the past to proclaim the gospel that's where we started that's where we ought to finish I wish this nation were as concerned about the spiritual starvation of souls all
[time=2694] around the world as they seem to be the starvation of some people in Somalia and I'm all in favor of helping Somalia I just wish it didn't stop with that so he calls them to revival he speaks
[time=2711] to these unregenerate people and says listen I am coming like a thief to bring harm repent how
[time=2717] wake up strengthen what remains complete what you began and observe the law of God they never
[time=2726] did they never did history is silent about the church at Sardis it didn't exist much past the
[time=2733] writing of this letter in fact even to this day there is no city of Sardis there is just a rubble and a ruin they failed to heed the words of the Lord but he does talk to some who did remain look
[time=2746] at verse four he speaks a word of commendation to those few faithful saints but you have a few
[time=2752] people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments and they will walk with me in white for they are
[time=2758] worthy this is a beautiful picture of obedience the word soil means to spot or disdain it means to
[time=2765] pollute and garments in the word of God talk about character and a pattern of obedience and a path
[time=2771] of life and what he is saying is there are a few of you there who have not polluted the path of your life he's not talking about a sin or something he's talking about a characteristic pattern of life you're walking obediently the garment is basically clean you're trying your best to live
[time=2786] obediently to the word of God and because of that verse four you'll walk with me in white for you
[time=2792] are worthy the garment that you have tried to keep clean on this earth in your life will be replaced
[time=2798] with the heavenly garment that will be pure and white in all holiness and you'll walk with me
[time=2804] for you're truly worthy of that this is the white garment of heaven Christ himself word in Matthew
[time=2810] 17 the unfallen angels word in Matthew 28 the two angels at the ascension of Christ had it on in
[time=2816] Acts 1 10 and the glorified saints will receive it in Revelation 19 8 and 14 we'll see that when we
[time=2823] get there so he commends them he says you're not polluted you haven't soiled your life
[time=2829] and for that I will reward you with the garment of heaven absolute total purity
[time=2835] and then he closes in verses five and six follow along these verses he who overcomes
[time=2843] shall thus be clothed in white garments and I will not erase his name from the book of life
[time=2849] and I will confess his name before my father and before his angels three things he says to them
[time=2855] number one I'll clothe you in white garments which is just a an iteration of the promise he gave in
[time=2861] verse four secondly he says of the overcomer I will not erase his name from the book of life
[time=2868] who's he talking to here he's talking to overcomers what's an overcomer just a normal Christian 1 John 5 people read this verse and they immediately say uh oh I will not erase his name from the book of
[time=2882] does that mean he will erase my name from the book of life I mean does that mean he does that the book of life Revelation 20 verse 15 is the book that your name has to be in or you get thrown into the lake of fire and so what people do is they take this promise I will not erase it
[time=2897] from the book of life and they turn it into a question or a quandary or a source of fear and
[time=2903] anxiety you mean he might I don't know why people do that he's doing something he is promising you
[time=2909] something I will not erase your name from the book of life that's consistent with the word of God
[time=2917] once you are truly saved once you are born again nothing can erase your name from the book of life
[time=2924] God will not remove your salvation he doesn't give it to you and then take it away eternal life is
[time=2930] your possession it's the doctrine of eternal security and if you're uncertain about that as some people are read the last several verses of roman's chapter eight you'll find that you are
[time=2940] absolutely totally secure in your salvation in Christ let me read that to you roman's chapter
[time=2947] eight if you want to turn over there hold your finger in in revelation I wasn't planning to do
[time=2953] this but it's on my heart roman's chapter eight verses 31 and following just listen to this can
[time=2961] anything steal you from God verse 31 what then shall we say to these things if God is for us who's
[time=2968] against us he who did not bear his own son but delivered him up for us all how will he not also
[time=2974] with him freely give us all things who will bring a charge against God's elect God is the one who
[time=2980] justifies who is the one who condemns in other words if you're in Christ who who has a right to
[time=2987] bring a charge against you you have been justified by God himself look at verse 34 Christ Jesus is he
[time=2996] who died yes rather who was raised who is at the right hand of God and who also intercedes for us not only can nobody bring a charge against you because God has justified you but Christ lives to intercede for you as you continue to fail and sin he seeks the forgiveness from the father that he procured for you on the cross verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ
[time=3018] now here's a couple of options tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness peril or
[time=3025] sword just as is written for thy sake they are being put to death all day long we are considered
[time=3031] as sheep to be slaughtered now he wraps it up verse 37 but in all things we are overwhelmingly
[time=3037] conquerors through him who loved us for I am convinced that neither death nor life nor angels
[time=3045] nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other created things shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord that includes you you are one of the created things you can't even separate yourself from God once you are truly born again you are eternally secure by the very God who justified
[time=3069] you by Christ who constantly intercedes for you such that you are overwhelmingly a conquer
[time=3075] so this is not a threat back to chapter three of revelation he's not threatening us
[time=3082] he is saying here is one of the promises that I've made another portion of scripture which I iterate here to you I will not erase your name from the book of life he may discipline you
[time=3093] if you're a believer and you get involved in sin he may discipline you he may even take your physical life he did that at the church at Corinth but he will never take away your spiritual life
[time=3104] he goes on to say then in verse five and I will confess his name before my father
[time=3110] and before his angels remember Matthew 10 he said if you'll confess my name before men I'll confess
[time=3116] your name before the father and that's what we do when we get baptized we confess the name of the Lord Jesus Christ publicly before men and as we live our lives we tell of the people I'm born again I love Christ I believe in Jesus we're confessing him constantly he will constantly confess us
[time=3131] before God the father so these are wonderful promises to these few remaining people living
[time=3139] in a dead city in a dead church then he closes in verse six as he often does and he who has an ear
[time=3145] let him hear what the spirit says to the churches he's saying listen to me you who are dead you
[time=3151] who are not alive come to life except Christ as your personal lord and savior
[time=3158] I'm thrilled you know today is really a celebration to study this passage for our church we're not a
[time=3165] dead church we couldn't be any more alive you folks are vibrant in your faith for Christ and
[time=3172] your testimony we're alive in our worship center we're alive in our work we're being faithful to the
[time=3178] great commission as God has called us but a passage like this while it causes most of us to rejoice
[time=3184] it may be a warning to some in a church this size there may be some who are dead you may be kind of
[time=3190] writing on the coattails of the energy of this church and think because you're a part of this church that you're saved I want to ask you a question this morning have you had a
[time=3203] that point in your life come to a point in your life where you've made a decision to accept
[time=3209] Christ as your savior I didn't say join the church or buy a bible or even give money
[time=3218] salvation is a personal thing that happens between you and Jesus Christ and God the father
[time=3226] and the elements of it as we have seen are a deep conviction of personal sin I am dead without Christ I was born a sinful person and I've lived a sinful life
[time=3238] and I deserve judgment I deserve damnation I deserve eternal death has that been the case in your life have you come to the place where you've said that to God
[time=3250] honestly not because it sounded right but because it was in your heart to say
[time=3256] because you're obviously aware of it you carry the guilt of it you see it the anger in your
[time=3262] heart that explodes at people from time to time the selfishness that permeate your life out of deep real conviction there's no question in your mind yes I am a I'm a sinner
[time=3272] that's the beginning of salvation then comes and I believe that Jesus Christ died for me
[time=3279] and I accept him you may have been in this church 20 years but if you have not had that kind of interaction or we could call it a transaction where you commit
[time=3289] your life to Christ you may not be saved some of you may have been saved very early in your
[time=3296] life you can't remember that but you can affirm that truth right now I'm not talking to you I'm talking to people who have never come to grips with their own sin and the need for salvation in Christ
[time=3308] I would hate to let a message like this go by that I didn't challenge you to examine
[time=3315] whether or not you're saved if you're not saved Jesus is offering life
[time=3323] without cost financial cost it'll cost you your life it's a funny thing he saves it and then you
[time=3331] give it back to him and he becomes your lord don't miss this opportunity to come to Christ
[time=3339] let's pray together. Father thank you for the words of scripture thank you for this understanding
[time=3349] of a dead church and Lord I'm thankful that this is not a dead church that we believe in Christ
[time=3356] that we believe in regeneration being born again coming to life as Paul did on the Damascus road
[time=3365] may we never deviate from that clear understanding of the word of God but for those who might be here this morning as a first-time visitor or as a long time a tender who haven't dealt personally
[time=3376] with the Savior may this be that moment convict them in their heart and draw them to yourself
[time=3382] that they might have life and have it abundantly in Jesus' name.
