[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=60] Isaiah chapter 55, where we will study the wonderful, probably one of the most powerful
[time=84] invitations to accept Christ in all the Word of God. Isaiah chapter 55, some have called
[time=94] this the Christmas passage of the Old Testament. Others have dubbed it John 3 16 of the Old
[time=101] Testament, but it is clearly one of the greatest invitations in all the Word of God to accept
[time=107] the Messiah as Savior. Isaiah 55 verses one and two.
[time=127] Welcome to the Bible Hour. We trust that you and your family are enjoying this Christmas season and that you are taking time to remember the true meaning of this celebration. Thank you for joining us today. It's Christmas time. Jesus has come. But is anybody really interested? Today in our study of Isaiah 55, we find God taking the role of a common
[time=147] street vendor, trying to persuade the pastors by to come to the Messiah. We encourage you
[time=153] to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Isaiah. We will be looking at chapter 55. Our special music today will feature the Living Christmas Tree Choir and
[time=166] a Duet by Marilyn Wong and Marsha Richard. Let's now join our service.
[time=182] Go tell it. Go tell it. Go tell it on the mountain.
[time=197] Go tell it on the mountain. Over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain.
[time=221] That Jesus Christ is born. Go tell it on the mountain. Over the hills and everywhere.
[time=235] Go tell it on the mountain. That Jesus Christ is born.
[time=245] While shepherds kept their watching or silent close, I loved. Behold throughout the heavens,
[time=258] there's shown a holy flag. Go tell it on the mountain.
[time=271] All over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain.
[time=280] That Jesus Christ is born. Go tell it on the mountain.
[time=288] All over the hills and everywhere. Go tell it on the mountain.
[time=297] That Jesus Christ is born. Down in a lowly manger, our humble Christ was born.
[time=314] Go tell it on the mountain. All over the hills and everywhere.
[time=338] Go tell it on the mountain. That Jesus Christ is born.
[time=346] Go tell it on the mountain. All over the hills and everywhere.
[time=356] Go tell it on the mountain. That Jesus Christ is born.
[time=365] Go tell it on the mountain. Go tell it on the mountain.
[time=382] He's born.
[time=412] A lonely path by desert light. A weary name of through the night.
[time=438] A holy name of the day. A holy name of the day. A holy name of the day. A holy name of the day.
[time=463] A holy name of the day. A holy name of the day.
[time=536] The child asleep in major light. The light of hope would break the day.
[time=551] A work of grace and just begun. The peace of God for everyone.
[time=564] Is there room for Him inside? A welcome chamber to a vine.
[time=577] Just a source of hope and air.
[time=590] Is there room for Him?
[time=593] Is there room for Him somewhere?
[time=614] In your heart, O Jesus.
[time=642] Good morning and welcome to the Bible hour. We're excited that you're with us this morning and we're thankful for another tremendous year that we've enjoyed as a church and as a family with you, our faithful viewers of the Bible hour. It's Christmas time as you know and one of the joys of Christmas is family gathering around us to enjoy the Christmas holiday.
[time=662] And we're excited that our family is together. In fact, we're taping this in our own home today just because we want to share our family with you. And one of the surprises that we're enjoying this year are some visitors from California. In fact, Heidi's family is here with us.
[time=676] Yes, we're excited to have Monica and Rob here this Christmas season. Monica is my sister and
[time=682] she lived with us the last five years that we were in California while she was in college and she was an encouragement to me and she was a great role model for the girls. Monica and Rob
[time=692] have been married a year and a half and we're praying that this Christmas that we'll have a white Hoosier Christmas for them while they're in Indiana. 92 has been a good year for our family.
[time=700] The girls have done well in school and in sports and have made many friends and we feel very
[time=706] settled to have our own home now and to be a resident of Indiana Fort Wayne. And what we're looking forward to in 93 is having our own little Hoosier. This one will be a firecracker do around
[time=717] the 4th of July. Thank you, Heidi. And we are just excited about this time together with family.
[time=724] And I can't tell you what a tremendous time we've had with a living Christmas tree again this year.
[time=729] We had to extend it to include it yet another performance. So there were 11 performances and all and we had a packed house each time. Some 22,000 people came to share in the joy of Christmas through
[time=740] the living Christmas tree. And what a privilege it was for me to be able as a part of the living
[time=747] Christmas tree to stand on the platform and proclaim clearly the wonders of the person of Christ.
[time=754] And the theme this year was not to lose our focus on Christ or on Christmas. Amid all the good things, the packages and the trees and the bows and the ribbons and the family and the food, which is great, but somehow to maintain focus and perspective on this marvelous blessed gift
[time=771] of the person of Christ. It was during the living Christmas trees that our church received a phone call from a woman who had been to the living Christmas tree and asked for a visit by some people
[time=782] from our church. And so we sent a team of three folks out, a husband and a wife and then another woman. All three of them are trained in presenting the gospel. And they went into this woman's home
[time=793] and she was so excited that they were here that she paused for just a moment before they started talking about spiritual things, ran next door to get her neighbor and brought the neighbor in.
[time=803] And then her husband joined them in that room. And for the next three and a half hours,
[time=809] they talked about the person of Jesus Christ and the difference that he can make in a person's life.
[time=814] This dear lady who called the church had been suffering from breast cancer and it had been
[time=821] unsuccessfully treated and she would soon lose her life to this cancer. But she had heard the
[time=828] message that there's a life after death in the person of Jesus Christ and she desperately wanted to know about that and she wanted her husband to know about that and she wanted her neighbor to know about that. And so in the course of this three and a half hour conversation, each individual there, the husband, this lady and her neighbor friend had opportunity to ask the
[time=847] questions that were on their heart about the person of Christ and what difference he could
[time=853] really make in a person's life. And the folks from our church were able to answer those questions
[time=859] from the Word of God and give them real tangible, solid, biblical answers to their questions.
[time=867] And at the end of that time, each one of them prayed to receive Christ as their personal learned and savior. And as I've talked with the members on that team, it wasn't as if they all felt pressure to do that just because one person was the other two felt they needed to. But instead, there was a real genuine encountering of Christ on the part of each one of them. And that's the joy,
[time=888] that's the excitement, that's the thrill and the real meaning of Christmas to see people who, whether they're facing death or just the emptiness and loneliness that life can bring and the sense of there's got to be more to this life than what I'm experiencing to give them the gospel
[time=905] in a general way and then be able to follow up personally and specifically with them the claims
[time=911] of Christ and for them to recognize what he can do in their life. And of course, we'll follow up with this family and this neighbor. We'll look forward to discipling these people and training them in the Word of God and equipping them to faithfully serve Christ in all that they would say and do.
[time=927] And I guess if you're with us this morning and you know Christ, I just want to challenge you to
[time=933] reach out to your neighbors and to the people at work to touch their lives with the gospel, to be the kind of witness both in your lifestyle but also using the opportunity to communicate the
[time=944] wonderful words of the blessed message of Christ coming at Christmas to touch their lives and to change them forever to see God give them eternal life through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=954] That's why we're here. That's the only reason we're left on this planet otherwise God would have taken us immediately home to heaven. We can worship better in heaven. We can study the word better in heaven. We won't need to study it. We won't learn anything about it. We won't have any sin in heaven. The only thing we're left here to do really ultimately is to bring people to Christ.
[time=971] Well, thanks for letting me share with you on that and we'll go back now to the regular portion of our service.
[time=979] In the little village of Bethlehem, there lay a child one day
[time=1006] and the sky was bright with a holy light or the place where Jesus lay.
[time=1018] Hallelujah oh how the angels sang. Hallelujah how it rang and the sky was
[time=1036] bright with a holy light. It was the birthday of the King.
[time=1065] It was a humble birthplace but oh how much God gave to us that day. From the manger bed what a path has led,
[time=1086] what a perfect holy way. Hallelujah oh how the angel sang. Hallelujah how it rang and the sky
[time=1108] was bright with a holy light. It was the birthday of the King.
[time=1136] Beautifully done thank you. As you know there are sisters if you didn't know that you could
[time=1142] probably detect it from the closeness of their voices as they harmonize. Beautiful.
[time=1148] Well this morning we're going to focus in on the Christ of Christmas and I guess we could turn to
[time=1156] Matthew chapter 1 and study the announcement of the birth of Christ as the angel came to Joseph
[time=1163] and said and she shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins
[time=1171] but we're not going to go to Matthew chapter 1.
[time=1173] We could go to Matthew chapter 2 and study there the magi as they followed the star from the east
[time=1183] and finally found the house in which Jesus was laying and gave him there the gifts they had
[time=1189] brought from afar but we're not going to go to Matthew chapter 2 we could go to Luke 1 and find Gabriel coming to Mary and his famous statement hail favored one the Lord is with you but we won't
[time=1202] go there this morning either in fact we're not going to go anywhere in the New Testament I'd like to study and look at Christmas from the Old Testament this morning and so if you have your Bible
[time=1212] come with me to the book of Isaiah the major prophet Isaiah and let's go to chapter 55
[time=1218] Isaiah chapter 55 some have called this passage the John 3 16 of the Old Testament
[time=1229] I always have thought of it as the Christmas passage of the Old Testament
[time=1235] for many reasons which I think will become obvious as we look at it even this morning
[time=1241] let's read the first two verses of Isaiah chapter 55 verses one and two you follow along hoe everyone who thirsts come to the waters and you who have no money come by and eat
[time=1254] come by wine and milk without money and without cost why do you spend money for what is not bread
[time=1262] and your wages for what does not satisfy listen carefully to me and eat what is good and delight
[time=1269] yourself and abundance incline your ear and come to me it may not be immediately apparent to you but
[time=1277] this gives us a very unique perspective on God the Father he appears in this passage as a common
[time=1286] vendor a common vendor who is trying to sell the blessed peace that comes in accepting the messiah
[time=1296] it is almost as if he has gone into the highways and the byways of life and hails for the attention of people as they pass by in hopes that he might entice them to buy his product
[time=1308] the scene here is not a manger but a marketplace it's a busy street and people are hustling
[time=1315] to and fro in their business and there would be on this street a number of different street vendors and they have brought with them their products cloth and garments and pottery and
[time=1327] rugs and whatever else they may have to sell and it is their job it is their livelihood it is
[time=1334] whether or not they'll survive in life as to whether or not they can do what any good salesman must
[time=1340] do and that is capture the attention long enough to engage in the process of making a sale and that
[time=1347] is what god the father is doing here and that is a different perspective for us oftentimes we see god the father we see him in the role of the provider of christ
[time=1359] john 3 16 for god so love the world that he gave his only big gotten son and from that verse we see god as the father who provides salvation through christ in other places of the bible we'll not see god as father so much but god as judge
[time=1375] god as judge and he will exact judgment and justice upon people who have failed to accept
[time=1383] the provision in his son second peter three seven but the present heavens and earth by his word
[time=1390] are being reserved for fire kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men
[time=1396] this passage is one of many that depicts god as judge who will at one point in time demand justice
[time=1403] of all who have ever lived for not falling in worship of the baby jesus we oftentimes see god in another light that as defender we see him coming as the defender of
[time=1414] the glory of christ where it's not so much justice that is demanded but that christ received the
[time=1420] glory and the honor that is due his name philippians chapter two therefore also god highly exalted
[time=1426] him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth in other words there'll be a day when god will function on behalf of christ and he will demand not so much justice but glory and
[time=1443] honor both in heaven and earth that christ deserves but in this passage not god the father not god
[time=1453] as judge not god as defender but god as salesman god condescends to the common street vendor
[time=1462] and he approaches people as a salesman would to entice them and draw them into accepting
[time=1468] the messiah and we'll look at him in action this morning we'll look at god the father selling
[time=1474] his wares appealing to people crying out to them to receive the blessed messiah and i imagine the
[time=1484] last several weeks as we've been shopping for christmas we've encountered all kinds of different
[time=1490] salesman not to mention our entire lives some of them are obviously manipulative and selfish
[time=1499] and shallow and you have the appearance or you get the appearance they'll say anything they think you want to hear so long as they can get your credit card in their machine and those kinds of
[time=1512] salesman give a bad name to salesmanship they are the ones that are hucksters they are the ones that
[time=1518] you need to avoid and that is not god here this is a picture of a real genuine servant and that's
[time=1525] what a salesman is who is doing his job he is trying to perceive your need he is trying to help you he
[time=1531] has a level of expertise about his product his product line and if he's good he'll know about all the other product lines of his competitor and he will serve you he will he will really be of help
[time=1543] to you you've experienced those kinds of people and that is the picture of god here god is not a huckster god is not a hustler god is not a rank pitchman who just wants your money he shows up in
[time=1554] some wagon in the west with snake juice to solve your latest calamity and so we'll look at god
[time=1562] and i think as we do you'll find both the wonder of christ the significance of christ and those
[time=1570] of you who have come to know christ will be able to echo in your heart this is who christ is i have
[time=1576] if you will bought the right product and maybe those of you who have yet to do that we'll find here
[time=1582] the persuasive powers of god to convince you to come to christ first one he has to do what any salesman has to do he has to capture the attention
[time=1594] he beckons out ho everyone who thirsts come to the waters you see him here among a line of many
[time=1602] other vendors and he is he is doing whatever he can to grab the attention and to draw focus and attention upon himself and he does it in a very basic way ho everyone who thirsts come to the waters
[time=1614] i think of vendors and i go back in my mind to my days in california there have been some
[time=1621] that stick out in my mind in at the los angeles coliseum there is a man there who sells programs and he doesn't just say programs get your programs programs get your programs this is the number
[time=1633] one program seller at the los angeles coliseum he does it this way he says programs get your
[time=1639] souvenir programs everybody wants to buy a program from him because the way he sells his programs grabs their attention he's not some boring person on the side
[time=1650] at dodger stadium when we used to go watch the dodgers play there's a guy that sells peanuts
[time=1656] and he doesn't just walk up and down the aisles saying peanuts get your peanuts
[time=1663] he carries this box of peanuts you know how they do with strapper and his gig is he can throw his peanuts behind his back and hit anybody anywhere who just bought
[time=1674] peanuts they pass they try to pass their dollar bills from the farthest point because they want to see him take the bag of peanuts and whip it around his back and go up 15 rows to the right and
[time=1684] the guy just gets it right in the face either catches it or he gets hit and this guy through
[time=1690] years of practice has perfected the art of throwing two bags of peanuts to two different customers and getting them both at the same time so he gets the two and that's what we like to do we get two guys from separate places okay pass your money now so he'd get it and he had to throw two at the same time he'd take the bags of peanuts get him his hand and somehow he had separated him and they'd go to the right people he saw more peanuts than anybody else
[time=1715] he captured attention he was a good salesman the first step of selling something is being
[time=1721] remarkable being unique calling to them and that's what God is doing here notice how God does it
[time=1727] not with the inflection of his voice so much or with the ability of his hand to throw a bag of peanuts but by appealing to the intrinsic need of every human being everyone who thirsts
[time=1739] to thirst is universal right is there anybody who doesn't thirst I mean this isn't somebody
[time=1746] trying to sell lawnmowers everybody doesn't have a lawn it's tough to sell lawnmores to people who don't have lawns God is calling attention and drawing people in in the universal common reality
[time=1757] all you who thirst we thirst naturally we thirst physically our bodies are some 70% water everybody
[time=1765] thirsts secondly he does it by drawing on this thirsting metaphor because thirst demands attention
[time=1772] you don't put your thirst off long you might wait 15 minutes you might even wait an hour if you
[time=1779] have to but if you're really thirsty that's all you want to do is satisfy your thirst it demands
[time=1785] your attention it'd be like the difference between selling carpet for your home and a new roof
[time=1792] you can go a little while without new carpet but try living in indiana with a leak in your roof
[time=1798] it doesn't happen it doesn't happen it demands immediate attention and so by calling to this
[time=1806] basic universal need that demands attention he singles himself out among these other line of
[time=1813] vendors and he knows that everyone who hears his voice has this need and he knows that this need
[time=1819] must be met so he is wise now of course this thirst that he speaks of
[time=1825] is not just physical thirst all the time in the word of God you will find thirst as as being a
[time=1834] metaphor to not physical but spiritual hunger spiritual thirst we can think of david out in there
[time=1840] in the desert in one of the psalms and he says as the deer pants for the brook the water of the
[time=1846] brook so my heart thirst for the oh my god and what is he saying he's saying i'm looking at this
[time=1854] physical reality there's this little doe and there's a drought and it hasn't had anything to drink and its tongue is hanging out of its mouth and it's preoccupied and consumed with the longing to find
[time=1866] something to quench its thirst for its physical body david looks at that and says that's me in a spiritual sense that's how i am spiritually i'm starving i'm dehydrating i'm the spiritual
[time=1878] tongue of my life is hanging out and i am preoccupied with a concern to have more of god
[time=1884] and long for god and thirsty for god you can notice that all through the word of god in fact
[time=1895] we are created and don't miss this we are created for god we are created to be satisfied in that
[time=1902] longing of the heart by only one thing jesus christ in fact when you go to revelation chapter 22 and
[time=1909] you see the end of the age and this earth is gone and this world has passed and the new heaven and the new earth is there coming from the throne of the lamb of god is a river of living water
[time=1922] and it is to say that there will no more be thirst because we will finally be in the very presence of the lamb of god himself and we will constantly be nourished and cared for in the spiritual thirst of our soul notice also he grabs your attention by offering you something for nothing
[time=1941] and even we who live and have been jaded by our culture and the the propagation of something for
[time=1948] nothing and we hear the announcements and we hear the advertisements and we immediately take a couple of steps back but we're always listening for something for nothing if it's free maybe i
[time=1959] really do want it notice that he says in verse one and you who have no money come by and eat
[time=1966] come by wine and milk without money and without cost it's free you don't have to give me a thing
[time=1974] if you're thirsty and you want that thirst quenched come to me and i will give you what you need and you don't have to pay me a thing it is utterly without cost so he grabs attention and very
[time=1986] effectively with great skill secondly he does what a good salesman must do he brings an awareness
[time=1995] in his customer the need for his product he brings the level of awareness for that need to a conscious
[time=2003] level look at verse two why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not
[time=2014] satisfy you see he's got a customer here who has been trying to satisfy the spiritual thirst of
[time=2021] his soul in a thousand different ways over and over and over and over again this person is trying
[time=2027] to satisfy the thirst of the soul but it never really satisfies they're paying out their salary for things which aren't bread it looks like bread it looks like it'll satisfy but i eat it and i'm not satisfied i'm still hungry and i come to another store and i see the store of spiritual
[time=2043] things and i go in there and i look to buy something and i give my wages for it and i receive it but again there's no satisfaction he says why are you doing that he draws that to their attention
[time=2055] and of course he's alluding to the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh and the boastful
[time=2061] pride of life all the things that would be offered by this world some of them are immoral some of them are moral in both category they won't satisfy we are eternal beings and we will only ultimately
[time=2073] be satisfied by an eternal being himself we will live forever and temporal things the things of this
[time=2080] world will not satisfy when i was in business school at at USC trying to get my undergraduate
[time=2088] degree we studied economics and one of the very basic principles of economics was the insatiable
[time=2096] wants of the consumer one of the reasons that that america works the way it does that our economy is
[time=2103] strong that it functions the way it does is this very simple rule that they give us the customer is
[time=2111] never fully satisfied he has insatiable wants he can buy something today that all his life he thought
[time=2117] would satisfy him and within weeks he'll want to buy something else rest assured he'll never find
[time=2125] the the certain combination of products that will leave him utterly satisfied and therefore never wanting to buy anything again you can always count on the insatiable wants of the consumers and
[time=2136] that is what he's saying here why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy you will never find anything in this earth anything on this earth that will
[time=2148] completely totally satisfy you oh there may be maybe moments of great joy there may be moments
[time=2154] of great culmination but you know yourself you know how quickly that sense of satisfaction just vanishes
[time=2164] like your breath on a cold morning it comes and then it's gone let me introduce you to a woman that
[time=2172] was struggling with this come with me to john chapter four for a minute keep your finger here and isiah because we'll come back to that let me introduce you to a woman that was literally wearing herself out trying to satisfy the thirst of her soul she's the woman at the well the
[time=2189] Samaritan woman this picture is jesus sitting by this well and he is weirried he is thirsty
[time=2197] in verse six chapter four jacobs well was there jesus therefore being weirried from his journey
[time=2207] was sitting thus by the well it was about the sixth hour now remember jesus is a human being and as a human being he's thirsty he's been busy in ministry and he's really thirsty and verse seven there came a woman of samaria to draw water and jesus said to her give me a drink and his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food so it's just jesus and this woman
[time=2229] and the Samaritan woman therefore said to him how is it that you being a Jew asked me for a drink since i am a samaritan woman and you know your bible well enough to know that jews didn't talk to samaritans verse ten jesus answered and said to her if you knew the gift of god and who it is
[time=2243] who says to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water now living water to her it was called bubbling water and it was the kind of water that would bubble up at the bottom of jacobs well and it was considered the freshest purest water it was
[time=2259] the most desirable water and then she has obviously this question verse 11 she said to him sir you
[time=2265] have nothing to draw with and the well is very deep in other words the bubbly stuff is deep deep deep where then do you get this living water or this bubbling stuff you are not greater than our
[time=2277] father jacob are you who gave us the well and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle jesus answered and said to her every now listen everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst
[time=2289] again is that true of course it's true every time you and i drink of physical water we thirst
[time=2296] again there is a momentary satisfaction it is the best thing for our bodies but nevertheless we thirst again verse 14 but whoever drinks of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst
[time=2310] but the water that i shall give him shall become in him a well of springing water up to eternal life
[time=2318] in other words there's two kinds of waters lady there's the kind that you have been coming to this
[time=2324] well to get day after day probably three times a day most of your life you leave your home you put the pot on your head you come out here you drop it down you fill it up you carry it back and it satisfies for a little while you cook with it you drink but it runs out you come back you do it over
[time=2339] and over and over and over again but i got a different kind of water i've got a water that if you come and get it from me you'll never have to drink again the repetitious stuff stops you'll be
[time=2349] satisfied look at her answer in verse 15 she's thinking this is some kind of a deal the woman said to him sir give me this water so i will not be thirsty nor come all the way here
[time=2360] to draw i believe she's still on the physical level she's still thinking that she can get out of heaven to come out here to this well three times a day and the Lord's trying to transition her thinking now to her spiritual thirst look at verse 16 he said to her go call your husband
[time=2376] and come here now friends what does he have to do with this i mean this is off the wall this is not
[time=2383] in the context of the conversation at all she's saying give me the water he says go get your husband verse 17 though woman said answered and said i have no husband Jesus said to her you have well
[time=2396] said you have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one whom you now have is not
[time=2402] your husband this you have truly said the woman said to him sir i perceive you are a prophet
[time=2408] what's going on here this is a conversation about thirst this is a conversation about
[time=2414] physical thirst and spiritual thirst and Jesus draws her into the conversation on the reality of
[time=2421] physical thirst and when she finally grasped the concept that there's a kind of water out there that's available from for which after which i'll never thirst again and she wants it he then must transition her thinking to the spiritual dimension he says go get your husband why because she's got
[time=2437] five of them the spiritual thirst of her soul has driven her back to not the well but the marriage
[time=2447] altar five different times hoping that this next one will satisfy the spiritual thirst in my soul
[time=2453] he didn't do it i divorced him i'll get another one he didn't do it i'll divorce him i'll get another one she is in a repetition motion not only coming to the well to draw physical water but
[time=2463] in coming to the marriage altar to draw yet another husband who she thinks will be this one who will satisfy go back now to Isaiah Isaiah 55 verse two why are you spending your money for what is not
[time=2477] bread and your wages for what does not satisfy what are wages what is money that you've earned at
[time=2483] your life you exchange time energy and your life for money he in essence is saying why are you giving
[time=2490] your life for things that are not bread why are you giving your life for something that does not satisfy to the woman at the well he is saying why do you continually go back to the marriage altar
[time=2501] to hope to satisfy the thirst of your soul you'd think after the first or second time you'd have
[time=2507] learned you're now through number five and on your way to number six now mind you here he's not judging her in john four and he's not judging these people here
[time=2517] he is he is appealing to them he is soft-hearted full of compassion saying would you please become
[time=2524] aware of your need for a different product would you wake up and see that what you are pursuing is
[time=2531] empty and it never delivers what it promises to deliver it's interesting god comes in this passage
[time=2541] not to judge not to condemn but to persuade grabs their attention and then says now please
[time=2551] notice notice what you've been buying from these other people does it satisfy no does it meet your
[time=2560] needs no well let me introduce you to my product then because mine does mine really works
[time=2568] look at it he introduces it to them back in verse one and you who have no money come and buy and eat
[time=2576] come by wine and milk he compares coming to the Messiah as water wine and milk man
[time=2589] from me you can receive water that really quenches your thirst what water does for the physical soul
[time=2595] Jesus Christ does for the spiritual soul from me you can receive wine I liken the gospel to wine
[time=2602] he says and maybe that's a mention to the merriment of wine that wine makes the heart glad more likely
[time=2608] I think it would refer to the blood of Christ which is oftentimes in the word of god compared with the wine and he is saying what you find in Christ is not only water to quench your thirst
[time=2619] but the blood of Christ to cleanse you from your sin and wipe away your guilt and remove from you the penalty of your behavior and then he says and it's like milk what nourishes like milk does
[time=2631] I mean milk is the thing we bring our young ones up on exclusively it has everything it needs to
[time=2638] nourish the little life and the word of god is compared to milk it says in the New Testament long for the pure milk of the word that buy it you may grow and respect to salvation he says what
[time=2650] I give you in my product the Messiah what I offer you in salvation through my product can be compared
[time=2657] to water that genuinely quenches the thirst of the soul to wine that is compared to the blood of
[time=2663] Christ that wipes away all guilt and judgment and punishment and to milk which if fed upon will
[time=2672] nourish your soul and give you direction and lead you in the way everlasting and teach you how to walk in the precepts of god it's a marvelous invitation it's a marvelous product
[time=2684] it sells itself he goes then from capturing their attention to raising their awareness
[time=2692] of their need for his product then to highlighting the satisfaction which can come from his product then fourthly he does what any good salesman does he tells him how you can get it how do I get this
[time=2703] product how do I respond to your to your invitation come to verse six with me and you'll see him doing
[time=2710] that he says seek the Lord call upon him seek the Lord while he may be found and call upon him while
[time=2721] he is near Deuteronomy 4 29 seek the Lord your God and you will find him if you search for him with
[time=2728] all your heart Joel 3 32 says and it will come about that whoever calls on the name of the Lord
[time=2737] will be delivered these are packed with meaning these two words in the Old Testament what it means
[time=2743] to seek God and to call upon the Lord is to just make him the absolute consuming priority of your
[time=2750] life make him the passion of your life how do I find this satisfaction about what you speak you get it by seeking not a product in itself but a person the person of Jesus the person of Messiah
[time=2761] it's a personal encounter between you and Christ on a regular basis where you set your heart and
[time=2768] your mind after him and him alone where all the decisions of your life are made in light of him and your relationship with him where all the decisions about time and people and money and
[time=2780] vocation it all comes under this one predominating theme of your relationship with the Lord he strengthens it in verse seven let the wicked forsake his way the unrighteous man his thoughts
[time=2793] and let him turn to the Lord that's the Old Testament recipe of repentance you want to know what repentance means repentance means to forsake his way forsake that behavior and forsake
[time=2805] your thoughts all of your reasoning that led you to that behavior which is faulty it's foolish
[time=2811] it's erroneous it doesn't satisfy as he has already instructed and then return to the Lord
[time=2818] repentance is forsaking your way forsaking your unrighteous thoughts and returning to the Lord
[time=2827] so he calls them to this he says this is exactly how to get it you want my product this is exactly how you do it you seek the Lord and you call upon his name having given that vital instruction he now moves to the clothes
[time=2844] the clothes how do you close a sail how do you bring this thing full circle how do you
[time=2851] how do you get the person to the place that they're ready to say okay count me and i'll buy it
[time=2857] here's my money here's my credit card let's do it when do i take delivery how do you close the sale well you already have seen some of it look at verse six again while he may be found
[time=2869] while he is near this is the in the terminology of our day this is the guy saying and by the way
[time=2878] this offer is only good for today this is today and today only take it or leave it this doesn't
[time=2884] offer forever or this is the offer that says come down here and buy this thing we've got a limited supply offer good as long as supply lasts that's there to put a little bit of urgency in your step
[time=2896] not to postpone the decision help you over the hurdle it can be manipulative sometimes people say that in the real world and they have hundreds and
[time=2907] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of the product they they have more than they could ever sell but they just say they have a limited supply to get you to come buy it but sometimes it's true sometimes it's true sometimes the guy's telling you the truth and if either you're only going to get this deal today and you really thank him for letting you know that that would obviously be the case with God this is true listen to Hebrews 927 it says this
[time=2929] for as appointed for man to die once and then comes judgment coming to Christ and seeking the
[time=2936] Lord and calling upon him is not something you can do after you're dead you basically have your lifetime to do this and you say how long is my lifetime I must have a long time well I don't know
[time=2947] in yesterday's performance one of the performances of the living Christmas tree I had to receive a
[time=2953] message from the usher that when I got up here before I did my little speech I had to ask this woman to see the usher because they had received word that a dear family member of hers had just
[time=2964] had a heart attack I don't know how life how long life lasts I'll tell you something right now though that in the city of Fort Wayne before this day is over somebody's going to die whether because of cancer or because of a car accident or because of heart failure only a fool anticipates that
[time=2980] they're going to live long enough to finally at the last moment make their decision for Christ make it now that's the point call upon him while he is near seek the Lord while he may be found
[time=2991] the day is coming when he will not be found you will seek for him and not find him let me read you an Old Testament passage that clarifies that so clearly he says I called to
[time=3002] you and you refused I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention and you neglected all my
[time=3010] counsel and did not want my reproof now listen to what he says I will even laugh at your calamity
[time=3018] I will mock when your dread comes when your dread comes like a storm and your calamity comes on
[time=3024] like a whirlwind when distress and anguish come on you then they will call on me but I will not answer
[time=3030] they will seek me diligently but they shall not find me because they hated knowledge and did not
[time=3038] choose the fear of the Lord they would not accept my counsel they spurned all my reproof so they
[time=3045] shall eat of the fruit of their own way and be satisfied with their own devices talk about satisfaction yeah they'll finally get it when they receive the just desserts for the
[time=3055] waywardness of the naive shall kill them and the complacency of fools shall destroy them he who
[time=3061] listens to me shall live securely and shall be at ease from the dread of evil Proverbs 1
[time=3068] the day is coming when God will not hear when God will not respond and he will be content
[time=3075] to let those who have spurned his offer of grace and forgiveness he'll be content to let them
[time=3082] in anguish die a spiritual death of eternity so part of his clothes is saying that there is a
[time=3090] limited time but the second part of his clothes is that this product has a guarantee look at it
[time=3098] verse 7 after we forsaken our way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and return to the Lord then he
[time=3104] says this and here's the guarantee he will have compassion on him and he will abundantly pardon
[time=3110] the words abundantly pardon describe an abounding measure of pardon in other words
[time=3116] there's no sin that anybody has ever committed or no number of sins that someone has committed that will escape the grace of God that would be too sinful to be forgiven there will be abundant pardon that will be more pardoned than is needed no matter what it is so he's saying if you're a murderer or if you've had an abortion or if you have divorced unbiblically or you have
[time=3137] been a drug addict or you have been involved in sexual abuse of your children or whatever the
[time=3143] stuff is that seems to be overcoming our culture it's all partnerable this product covers it all
[time=3152] no fine print no exception clauses no coming back later and saying wait a minute you didn't tell me this it's all covered the whole thing abundantly pardon laymen
[time=3164] but the customer he doesn't want to buy because he's smart you see he knows there's no free lunches
[time=3177] he's saying this is too good to be true nobody offers this stuff for free my poppy told me
[time=3184] that there's no free lunches nobody gives something of value away for nothing
[time=3190] and so lest we lose that customer God says he come back here a few chapters come come with
[time=3197] you will you to Isaiah 53 Isaiah 53 verse two we're talking about Jesus here he grew up before him
[time=3214] like a tender shoot and like a root out of parched ground he has no stately form or majesty that
[time=3220] we should look upon him or appearance that we should be attracted to him verse three he was despised and forsaken of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and like one from whom mid-hide their face he was despised and we did not esteem him now here it comes you want to know who paid the price look at verse four surely our griefs he himself bore and our sorrows he
[time=3243] carried yet we ourselves esteemed him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was pierced
[time=3250] through for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the chastening for our well-being
[time=3256] fell upon him and by his scourging we are healed all of us like sheep have gone astray each one of
[time=3266] us has turned to his own way but the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him
[time=3275] yeah you're right there is there are no free lunches you don't get something for nothing you were properly instructed by whoever taught you that and whenever you hear that have a weary eye look with great caution but the fact is the offer that the Lord is making God the father is making
[time=3293] as he stands along this busy street and beckons for people's attention so he can highlight to them the futility of their lives and compare his marvelous gospel to the satisfying water and wine and milk
[time=3304] of the gospel and give direction as to how they might procure that satisfaction in their life by seeking the Lord and calling upon him this offer does not come free it's only free to the customer
[time=3316] somebody else has already paid so the offer can indeed be genuinely free and that one person
[time=3325] is Jesus Christ it's the baby in the manger that's what Christmas is all about
[time=3332] Jesus came not just to be born Jesus came to die and die he did out of love out of compassion so he could grant full and free pardon of guilty people
[time=3347] without cost i was reading this week in smithsonian magazine and i came across
[time=3357] a little excerpt about an astronomer his name is john dobson it's so fitting listen
[time=3363] he calls out come come and see the sun sun says the pitchman to a
[time=3372] covey of tourists on the lake shore i give you the sun the whole sun and nothing but the sun
[time=3378] he stoops to greet a little girl one an elevator ride as he lifts her up to the eyepiece of his telescope he whispers to her see the green balloon that's the sun the dark spot there is a sun spot
[time=3392] it's as large as the earth who says the little girl he puts her down and invites others to peer
[time=3398] into his telescope while they take their turns he keeps up a stream of patter about magnetism and
[time=3404] gravity and radio interference and the special design of his telescope that allows people to
[time=3411] view the sun without searing their eyeballs as he speaks his hands describe theatrical arches and
[time=3418] his silver hair flutters in the wind his voice rises and falls with studied modulation he's a
[time=3424] salesman after ooze and wows the people move on but soon the pitchman spots fresh prey a couple
[time=3432] in bermuda shorts and hails them come come see the sun thus john dubson barker for the cosmos
[time=3440] step right up ladies and gentlemen and look through his magical machines he only wants to

[time=3455] come come see the sun not through a telescope but through the very living word of god
[time=3462] and it will cost you a dime because it's already been paid through the death of the blessed baby
