[time=0] So Paul is saying that it's good, it's good to be single, and he goes on to list the several advantages and freedoms of being single.
[time=8] There are several of them that will find in our text this morning and we're going to examine each one.
[time=26] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=33] Thank you for joining us.
[time=35] Today Pastor Moore continues his series on singles.
[time=38] Today is Part 2 of the Bliss and Blisters of Singleness.
[time=42] Most individuals probably would not plan in the early stages of their lives to remain single.
[time=47] Marriage and family are considered to be more normal.
[time=50] Does God really expect some individuals to remain single? And what are the positive and negative aspects of being single?
[time=57] Please have your Bibles open as we look at first Corinthians.
[time=61] Our special music today will include our sanctuary choir and orchestra singing "Every Valley"
[time=68] and Susan Toyrack stump singing "Each One Reach One".

[time=441] Hello and thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=447] I'll also wear in the midst of some good Midwest weather.
[time=451] I've been kind of wishing this on you know that's a little bit selfish.
[time=454] But you've had just too good a weather here in Indiana coming from California.
[time=458] So we needed to just let you know that there are a couple weeks here of some pretty cold weather.
[time=463] Well we've had an absolutely fantastic time with the snow.
[time=465] School was canceled for a day and I took part of the morning and my kids and I went sledding.
[time=470] And then one of our evening services on Wednesday night was canceled and so we went sledding again.
[time=475] And we're so new to this that it's wonderful. We love it.
[time=479] Well it's nice to go out your back door with your children and slide down the hills.
[time=482] I'll admit that and I really hope in all sincerity that it's not a detriment to you.
[time=486] It's just the way of life in Indiana, the weather changes.
[time=489] Sometimes it gets pretty cold but before you know it in a few days we'll have some mild weather again.
[time=495] I'd like to introduce you to a guest that we have in our studio today.
[time=499] Mr. Wade Holbrook, Wade is the director of Pure Heart Ministries and he has a program that will be taking place in just a couple weeks here at Black Hawk Baptist Church called Sing for Joy.
[time=510] Welcome Wade, we're glad to have you here.
[time=512] Well thanks for inviting me Pete.
[time=513] You started the, well I don't really remember when the program started. Would you tell us when it started?
[time=519] Well we had our first Sing for Joy back in 1989.
[time=522] I think the idea came to me probably around 87 and took a couple of years to formulate my head.
[time=527] How to have an event that would support local church music ministries and we came up with Sing for Joy.
[time=533] Well obviously there's some singing that's involved. Now what actually takes place at Sing for Joy?
[time=539] Well Sing for Joy occurs over three weekends.
[time=542] We have somewhere between 150 and 200 vocalists who come in and sing are critiqued by local music ministers, people from Nashville, Tennessee, down on Anderson, Indiana.
[time=551] And we critique them, give them encouraging comments on how to better improve their ministry and they are scored also and they go through a preliminary and then a finals process and then we have some winners that appear in an evening concert.
[time=562] We're pretty interested in that evening concert since this happens here for the public and right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church tell us when that happens and what takes place there.
[time=572] The evening concert will occur on Saturday evening February the 8th at 7pm and we use the beautiful worship center facility here for it.
[time=580] It's a love offering concert there's no admission charge for it and Jeffrey Benward who is a music minister living in Nashville, Tennessee.
[time=588] Now originally from this area grew up in Auburn, Indiana for years was an artist and resident at Second Baptist Church in Houston, Texas.
[time=595] And now resides in Nashville, he'll be coming back home to host the evening concert, kind of introduce the local talent for us and also put together a small concert of his own.
[time=604] I know that I've been at a number of the Sing for Joy concerts and we've heard some marvelous music and always the guest is a great inspiration to us.
[time=612] So I want to mention that date once again that's on Saturday evening February 8th at 7pm right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=620] If you want to hear some of the great local talent in our area for many of the churches and also the special guest, Jeff Benward, please make a note of that and come and join with us on Saturday evening February 8th at 7pm.
[time=633] And Russell, we have a devotional booklet that the Bible hour supports and gives out and many people have subscribed to it.
[time=641] We're giving it out this month as a free gift offer. I'd like to have you tell the audience a little bit about it.
[time=646] Well, you probably like the rest of us look for opportunities to spend with the Lord and have those times that we do spend the Lord be meaningful and insightful into your own Christian life.
[time=656] And I want to encourage you to receive this month as a free gift offer from the Bible hour or fresh moments and have the opportunity to experiment with it and find that it doesn't really help you when you walk with the Lord.
[time=668] You could receive fresh moments by writing to the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=678] We encourage you to write today once again the address is the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=689] We're very encouraged that you continue to write in and tell us that you're watching the Bible hour no doubt with this colder weather.
[time=695] We hope that there are some people that might be watching the Bible hour for the first time. We welcome you.
[time=700] We go back to the live portion of our service now with more music and then the second to the series of messages from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=730] Today a man is somewhere proclaiming the good news winning families to Jesus all around his neighborhood.
[time=750] He tells them that God is able to make their house a home. He wants to win his world for Christ but he can't do it alone.
[time=766] And each one can reach one. If we follow after Christ we all can lead one.
[time=780] We can lead one to the Savior. And together we can tell the world that Jesus is the way if we each one reach one.
[time=809] The message is unchanging. Go into all the world and share the love of Jesus.
[time=819] Far away your door to door. You see just like somebody told you that Jesus loves you so you must tell someone who will tell someone until the whole world knows.
[time=838] And each one can reach one. As we follow after Christ we all can lead one.
[time=851] We can lead one to the Savior. And together we will tell the world that Jesus is the way if we each one.
[time=896] And together we can tell the world that Jesus is the way if we each one reach one.
[time=935] Thank you, Susan. We are so blessed with the people that minister of music here, David and Debbie, we're going to miss you.
[time=959] I'm sure that's God's will for your life, but we are going to miss you.
[time=971] Well, we've taken a little bit of a break out of our study from the book of 1 Timothy to follow a line of thought about single people and we've turned to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 to do that.
[time=991] Paul is responding to some specific questions, which we don't really know exactly what the questions are, but we have the benefit of reading his answers.
[time=999] He says in chapter 7, verse 1, "Now concerning the things about which you wrote." In other words, you guys have sent me some questions about many things.
[time=1007] In particular, there's a series of questions, apparently about being single. And so Paul gives himself to answering those questions in chapter 7.
[time=1014] He begins by saying that it is good for a man not to touch a woman. It is good to be single. He defends the idea of being single against all kinds of pressures that might have been upon the Corinthian Christians.
[time=1027] And that might have been upon some Christians even here in our own assembly.
[time=1032] Not to touch a woman there in verse 1 as a Jewish euphemism that describes or intimates towards the physical intimacy of marriage and, of course, in Paul's mind, that would only happen inside of marriage.
[time=1043] So what he is saying is that it's good for you not to be married. It's good for you to be single. And in that way, he defends it.
[time=1050] He defined it for us over in verse 7, yet I wish that all men were even as I myself am. However, each man has his own gift from God, one in this manner and another in that.
[time=1062] Singleness is a gift. There is a gift called the gift of singleness. It's a special endowment of the grace of God that enables a person to live outside of what might be normative.
[time=1072] I looked at Adam and said it's not good for a man to be alone and gave him e. That's normative. For most of us, marriage is normative. There is, however, a gift, the gift of singleness that enables a person to live outside of that kind of supportive emotional, physical, spiritual intimacy that we who are married come to enjoy in that state.
[time=1093] Thirdly, he helped us diagnose it. If I'm single or if I have a single child who's well into their life now, how do we talk about that? How do we understand if I and do indeed have the gift of singleness? Verse 9, he says, it can be diagnosed by this thing called a lack of self-control.
[time=1112] If you don't have that self-control, let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn. And both of those words talk not only about the physical intimacy of marriage, but as we said earlier, the whole idea of marriage and what it's supposed to mean and the communion of two people and the love and the support.
[time=1129] If you can live without that, being a burning and flame desire that just captivates your mind and your thought life and really prohibits you from pursuing a course in your life that whatever preclude marriage, if you have a peace with the idea of being unmarried, then that's probably an indicator that God has given you that gift.
[time=1148] It doesn't mean you'll have it all your life. It doesn't mean that at some point some person might not come into your life and you'll suddenly realize, no, I can't live without marriage. I can't live without him or I can't live without her.
[time=1160] It is possible. I believe to have a gift of singleness at one point in your life and not in another. Paul was married at one point in his life. We believe there seems to be a lot of evidence for that and certainly by the indication of this passage, he is not married now.
[time=1174] So singleness, defended, defined and diagnosed. Paul is saying that it is good to be singleness and the question we want to probe this morning is, what's so good about it? What are the benefits of being singleness? What is it about being singleness that is so good or so helpful?
[time=1190] And we'll phrase this by way of freedom. What are the freedoms that God gives to the single person? And if you will, I'd like to paint a bit of a backdrop, a contemporary backdrop of what might be the, what is invoked now for singles.
[time=1206] It comes out of an article that was in business week July 29, 1991 entitled Home Alone with $660 billion. Subtitles, single Americans are turning into a marketer's dream.
[time=1221] It opens this way. Meet David Freeman, single. A prospering freelance journalist, Freeman32, has a kind of unencumbered cash flow and heednistic taste that make marketers drool.
[time=1235] Freeman spends $150 a week eating out or ordering in. He stays in shape by riding his expensive high-tech bicycle and by ethylons. He takes such adventure vacations as scuba diving in the Bahamas.
[time=1250] His New York apartment is crammed with a VCR2 TV, a fancy stereo and a personal computer. The article goes on to say that while he may be single, he certainly isn't alone. The 1990 census shows that about 23 million Americans live by themselves.
[time=1266] Now that's not singles living together. This is 23 million people living all by themselves. A 91% jump for women since 1970 and 156% jump for men from that same time period.
[time=1279] The article attributes this trend to the energy or is being propelled by the fact that one unprecedented numbers of adults are never marrying and two by some estimates 60% of all the marriages now end in divorce.
[time=1294] And so there is this huge population with an earning power of $660 billion and as the married baby boomers evolve into budget conscience parents, marketing agencies have identified this to singles as the last big spenders.
[time=1314] Against that kind of mentality for the single life and that may not be true of you as a single person but allow that to stand as a caricature or a typical example of the mindset of unsaved, unredeemed single people in the world today.
[time=1329] Paul says that man there's a different kind of freedom that he is offering or describing or proposing for people who have the gift of singleness and we find three of them in the passage in front of us from verses 25 down to 35, chapter 7.
[time=1344] The first is what we'll call the freedom to suffer in difficult assignments. Single people have a freedom to suffer in difficult assignments, verses 26 to 28.
[time=1355] Secondly, single people have the freedom to seize limited opportunities, verses 29 to 31. And thirdly, single people have a freedom to serve in undistracted devotion to God, verses 32 to 35.
[time=1372] Let's take a look at those.
[time=1374] First the freedom to suffer in difficult assignments, verses 25 to 28, you follow along. Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.
[time=1391] I think then that this is good and view of the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is.
[time=1397] Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. But if you should marry, you have not sinned and if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned, yet such will have trouble in this life and I am trying to spare you.
[time=1414] Now he begins with this idea of his own opinion up in verse 25. I just want to make a brief note of that. Concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord but I give an opinion as one who by the mercy of the Lord is trustworthy.
[time=1425] Oftentimes when Paul would speak on topics that the Lord has not specifically spoken of, he would identify that. He would say I have no command of the Lord.
[time=1433] Back in the same chapter, verse 10, you will notice that he is talking about something the Lord has said and so he says I get this from the Lord. But to the married I give instructions not I but the Lord.
[time=1443] Then he goes on to describe some things the Lord had already talked about when the Lord was on the earth.
[time=1448] When Paul comes in, it was said that the Lord never dealt with specifically. It is typical of him to say I have a Lord didn't say this but here it is.
[time=1456] And that doesn't in any way deny the authoritative reality of his words or that they are indeed the Word of God. He is just making note of that fact.
[time=1464] In John 16, Jesus said, "I have many more things to say to you but you cannot bear them now but when he the Spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth."
[time=1475] And primarily of course he is referring there to the resurrection, the crucifixion and the resurrection and all the implications of it.
[time=1481] Just the advent of the Spirit of God at Pentecost, we are now as believers capable of understanding more truth about Jesus Christ and about the church.
[time=1489] And the Spirit of God through the person of Paul pins additional information that the Lord didn't cover some of that is in this chapter.
[time=1496] That's all that means. By way of him calling it his opinion, he is going to lean towards singleness.
[time=1502] He is going to promote that idea in these next few verses but he calls it his opinion because he doesn't want to make an absolute.
[time=1509] He doesn't want to say you have to stay single and you'll see that as we move through the passage.
[time=1513] So he begins in verse 26, "I think then that it is good and view of the present distress that it is good for a man to remain as he is."
[time=1523] We have difficulty identifying the exact meaning or what was in his mind when he talks about this present distress.
[time=1530] We don't know exactly what it is. It might be some immediate problem that is impacting the married people at the church in Corinth.
[time=1538] On the other hand, it might be Paul's anticipation or awareness of the Roman persecution which would come shortly.
[time=1544] Ten years after Paul wrote this, the man by the name of Nero would make torture into an art.
[time=1549] He would sow believers into animal skins and throw them to the dogs.
[time=1554] He would dress Christians in clothing that had been dipped and soaked in wax and then tie them to trees and light them and fire like a teaky torch in his garden.
[time=1563] Making them into human candles, all that would happen within ten years after the writing of this book.
[time=1568] Did Paul know about that? We don't know. Maybe he did. Acts 21, "Aggibus the Prophet comes to Paul, takes his belt, wraps it around him and says when you go to Jerusalem, this is how the Jews will treat you."
[time=1577] It wasn't uncommon for Paul to have additional revelation about his own life and he may have had some insight or understanding of this coming Roman persecution and it may be this reference here, this present distress.
[time=1588] It might however be just a general reference to the generating condition of the world as we approach the second coming of Christ.
[time=1595] Second Timothy 3-1, "But realize that in the last days difficult times will come and here again just maybe some general reference to how hard life is going to become as we move towards the end of the age."
[time=1607] But whatever the particular distress in view here, Paul says it is better to be single when under distress. It is better to be single than married when times are really tough and persecution is hot.
[time=1619] In other words, persecution is difficult enough for a single person but the problems and the pain are multiplied and compounded when someone is married.
[time=1629] Paul, for example, as an unmarried man was able to roam through the ancient world, sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ with in a sense, a carefree attitude, sure he was under persecution and city after city after city they tried to kill him but he didn't have the burden and the weight and the responsibility of knowing that he had a wife and children behind and who would care for them.
[time=1649] I know in my own life I have felt a sense of being constrained by the responsibilities to my wife and to my children and I wouldn't trade my wife and my children for any ministry opportunity in the world. I don't have the gift of singleness and I'm completely devoted to that.
[time=1664] But there is a sense in which I am constrained by the kind of ministry I can be involved in because of them.
[time=1670] Before I came here I was the pastor of a church in Silmar, California. Silmar was the city there that we were pastoring and it was a tough city.
[time=1680] When I was pastoring for those two years they had the largest cocaine bust in the history of California in that very city, locked up in a warehouse. You may have heard about it.
[time=1689] Millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars of cocaine sitting in that warehouse they had a duffel bag with ten million dollars in cash in the same place somehow they discovered it.
[time=1698] Rodney King, you remember that name, he was arrested right there in the streets of Silmar.
[time=1702] A friend of mine by the name of Jeff Zahn was visiting some of his friends in Silmar and didn't really understand the city all that well and made the mistake of leaving his car park outside on their driveway.
[time=1713] When in had dinner played a few games when he came back out his car was stripped. Almost all of the valuable things were gone which isn't unusual if you live in LA.
[time=1722] What is unusual is that he went and called the police right there when that happened to explain the situation the police said, "Man, we're not going to come out and make a report on that."
[time=1729] You left your car outside in somebody's driveway after dark in Silmar. What did you expect? That's Silmar.
[time=1736] In other words, we can't find these guys. Crime is too rampant. It was a very, very crime-ridden crime-infested, degenerated city and families were falling apart and drugs ran rampant and it was really harsh.
[time=1750] Now I love that ministry and I love those people and we were having a fantastic time seeing some of those come to Christ.
[time=1756] But when Heidi and I were in the position to make a decision to leave administration of a college and go full time into a senior pastorate we gave serious consideration to Silmar and it wasn't the ministry itself that kept us from going there.
[time=1768] It was the fact that I did not have a piece about moving my wife and my four daughters into that particular city. That's just where I was at.
[time=1777] I was willing in my heart, I was open to that but there was not a sense of freedom from the Lord to make that particular move.
[time=1785] Other men have that freedom. I'm aware of a guy by the name of Floyd McClung who is leading a tremendous youth outreach ministry. He moved his family to Amsterdam, moved into the red light district on the very street on which he moved.
[time=1798] It was kind of a city street and he was running an apartment up above a shop and on that very street there was a brothel and there was a gay bar and there was a porno house.
[time=1807] I mean all within a stone's throw of his house. He had that freedom. I don't. Sometimes married people don't and so there is a sense of restriction in that ministry.
[time=1820] Richard Wormbrand wrote a book tortured for Christ. A pastor by the name of Florescu was tortured with red hot irons, pokers and with knives. He was beaten very badly.
[time=1832] He was starving rats were driven into his cell through a large pipe. He couldn't sleep but had to defend himself all the time. If he rested a moment the rats would attack him.
[time=1841] He was forced to stand for two weeks day and night. The communists wished to compel him to betray his brethren but he resisted steadfastly.
[time=1851] In the end they brought his 14 year old son and began to whip the boy in front of his father saying that they would continue to beat him until the pastor said what they wished him to say.
[time=1861] The poor man was half mad. He bore it as long as he could. When he could not stand it anymore he cried to his son Alexander. I must say what they want. I can't bear your beating any longer.
[time=1875] I don't know exactly what confession was made. I don't know if that was right but I do know that I personally can't think of any more traumatic situation as I'm sure you could.
[time=1886] Then being tortured and then having your family brought in front of you and say you do what we want or we'll continue to torture the ones you love most.
[time=1895] I counseled a family in our own church right here in Blackhawk not more than two or three weeks ago who are equipped and qualified and prepared and are desirous in their heart to move forward into a ministry that would be taking them to a foreign land with certain difficulties.
[time=1909] As we move through that conversation they just did not have the freedom in light of family concerns to move at this time.
[time=1916] Paul is basically saying that there are certain restrictions put on married people that single people don't have.
[time=1924] Single people can enjoy a freedom from pressure without having people dependent on them in that way with a responsibility to care for them.
[time=1933] Let me say it this way. Single people with the gift of singleness are more expendable than are married people. Now please that's a compliment in my mind.
[time=1943] In other words what we're saying is that God has given some the gift of singleness so that they can approach the more difficult situations for the advancing of the Kingdom of God and really become almost like a green beret or an elite force that is able to do things that the other people can.
[time=1958] Paul certainly saw himself as expendable for the cause of Christ. So that is a basic understanding. He then moves to qualify in verse 27.
[time=1969] Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. In other words for some who might hear this counsel and say oh man times are really getting tough and it's tough on the family.
[time=1979] I think I'll divorce my wife that way I can be I can be singly saying no no that's not what I'm saying if you're bound to a wife don't seek to be released.
[time=1987] Are you released? Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. In other words if you are free from that responsibility stay free and use your freedom to approach the Kingdom of God in very unique and specific challenging ways.
[time=2001] But then in verse 26 he qualifies it further but if you should marry you have not sinned and if a virgin should marry she has not sinned.
[time=2010] He's saying you don't have to do that again this is my opinion remember verse 25 in the Lord's plan it's you can do either then at the end of verse 28 yet such will have trouble in this life and I am trying to spare you.
[time=2024] The word trouble there flips us in the Greek means to be pressed together it's like being caught between a rock in a hard place and he's just reaffirming the reality.
[time=2033] That when you are married and your committed is serving God there will be times in which you'll have a pressure to do a certain ministry but there'll be another pressure not to do that ministry by virtue of what is best to your priority to love your wife and raise your family.
[time=2047] All these saying single people don't have that go get him sick him go anywhere you want to go do anything you want to do be anything you want to be because you have freedom that other people don't have.
[time=2058] Secondly verses 29 to 31 the freedom to seize the limited opportunities verse 29.
[time=2068] But this I say brother and the time has been shortened so that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none and those who weep as though they do not weep and those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice and those who buy as though they did not possess and those who use this world as though they did not make full use of it for the form of this world is passing away.
[time=2093] Paul is speaking to these single people and he's trying to give them some perspective about life in general and about marriage and about some other things and he's wanting to bring perspective and help them to understand priorities and balance and wisdom and maturity.
[time=2108] And he's saying there's a kind of balance and a kind of wisdom that comes from the awareness that the form of this world is passing away as it says there at the end of verse 31.
[time=2119] The word form is a manner of doing things it's a way of life it's a mode of existence.
[time=2125] He's saying that's passing away and uses a very descriptive term for passing away it comes out of the arts the area of the arts and talks about if you're in a theater and they're changing the scene they're changing the sets on the stage.
[time=2138] This world is like a façade it's temporary it's not permanent it's not forever and just like the façade on a stage that gets removed between one act and another so is the world it's temporary and the whole way of doing things is passing away it's being shifted it continues for a little time but it's gone here today and gone tomorrow today the world is busy with one set of actors tomorrow a new company appears only to be replaced by another shortly thereafter.
[time=2167] How much do you want to set your affections on something like that how engrossed do you want to become Paul says be balanced because of that.
[time=2176] Verse 29 he talks about the time the time being shortened and this is time as in a fixed appointed time this is not Kronos in the Greek which would talk about the flow of events he's not saying I've shortened the flow of events as if I'm going to remove some important element out of the you know the eschatological future of the world.
[time=2196] He's just saying the amount of time I'm going to let all that transpire I just shorten it it's not going to take as long the time is shortened we have less time to be on this earth the set is going to be removed quicker than maybe we had originally thought.
[time=2210] James 414 life is what a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away and we get new understandings of that at least we Californians do you walk out your door you open your mouth and vapors come out there it is right in front of your very eyes but it's gone.
[time=2224] It's just that's your life gone that's how brief the whole thing is be reminded of that let that give perspective and balance to your understanding of five legitimate activities that he lists there marrying sorrowing rejoicing possessing and enjoying.
[time=2243] Five very legitimate activities but they're balanced by the reality that the world is passing away let's look at each one just briefly with skip marriage and come back to it.
[time=2253] What does he mean in verse 30 those who weep as though they did not weep does that mean that Christians don't cry does that mean that Christians can't sorrow does that mean that when somebody gets deathly ill or we lose a family member or some tragedy happens in our family that we don't weep of course that's not what it means we're supposed to weep that shows that we're human and we're in touch with our feelings and we're aware of reality what he's saying is that we don't fall apart we don't lose all hope we aren't immobilized by it doesn't destroy our sense of purpose and meaning.
[time=2281] Because we are aware that there is another life to come we are balanced by the hope of eternal life rejoice and those who rejoice as though they do not rejoice well nobody has more joy than a believer true unadulterated joy of God as he fills our hearts and gives us purpose and meaning we're a joyful people.
[time=2302] The point is we are not to live for that joy that is not the beginning and the end of the Christian experience it is not the greatest aim of a believer to have joy that's not why we come to church that's not why we read the Bible that's not why we obey the scriptures that's not why we build relationships so we can have joy we do all those things for the glory of God
[time=2322] and an expression of our love for him and find joy as a byproduct of that he's saying live in that understanding live in the understanding that this whole thing is passing away and the joy that you have is as it is tied to this temporal setting is also passing away.
[time=2339] In other words don't lose control of your emotions be balanced by good judgment judgment that is given to you the world is passing away what about our possessions the universe 30 and those who buy as though they did not possess there's nothing wrong with owning things or something wrong with buying things God is delighted for you to have things he gives them for your enjoyment some of us have more than other and that is all part of the sovereign plan of God but what God has given you he gives you to enjoy.
[time=2368] But not to lose your focus not to live for it not to let it stick its claws in you and start to dictate your lifestyle and who you are and where you go and what you do and who you talk to because you're balanced by the reality that it's just passing by it's not forever it's not eternal.
[time=2383] The same would be true of the world it's a beautiful place we live verse 31 those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it God has given us an incredible planet and the privileges of living here are unbelievable.
[time=2397] But we don't hang on to that that is not the priority we don't worship the creation over the creator we keep things in perspective and all that is associated with the world and the world system from which we can enjoy some legitimate pleasure that is passing away.
[time=2412] So Paul is saying that as Christians we should think a certain way towards sorrow towards joy towards possessions towards this world and towards marriage what does he mean verse 29.
[time=2426] So that from now on those who have wives should be as though they had none to the single people he says look you're not supposed to live only for marriage you're not supposed to put marriage at a level that it totally
[time=2441] consumes the reality of your life as you contemplate marriage as you think about what it is remember it's got to be balanced just like everything else just like joy and just like sorrow and just like possessions and just like your understanding of the world marriage is not forever marriage is not the total consuming reality of a person's life contrary to some contemporary marriage counseling which puts marriage so completely out of balance that marriage becomes the all consuming reality.
[time=2467] And I believe it really legitimizes kind of a mutual self absorption in other words under the banner of marriage that great Christian institution some people are pushing it to an extreme that all their time all their money all their energy is really consumed in very selfish ways marriage is my number one priority
[time=2486] and so ministry in the church suffers and ministry in evangelism suffers and my whole ability to contribute to the kingdom is mitigated by that inordinate commitment to marriage.
[time=2497] Really they just are defending their own little private comfort zone found within the family unit covering an apathy for the kingdom of God by the cloak of marriage.
[time=2508] Paul says no that's not the way he corrects the wrong impressions of single people about marriage marriage is temporal marriage does not last forever it isn't the greatest reality even on earth God is and your love relationship to Christ and the way your family can serve Christ is the greatest reality.
[time=2526] Jesus even said in Matthew 22 there'll be no marrying in heaven we we the person that we love now with all of our hearts and our wives and I'm going to be our wife in heaven just going to be sister Heidi.
[time=2539] It's kind of a weird thought in a little sister Heidi.
[time=2542] So all of these the common thread is that of placing an inordinate emphasis on something that is in and of itself not bad nothing bad with marriage or sorrow or rejoicing or possessions or enjoying the world.
[time=2555] If it has its proper place.
[time=2558] So the single person is reminded even as they view marriage even as they anticipate marriage.
[time=2565] That there is more to life than marriage and don't seek marriage as the cure all to problems that you might be experiencing as if there'll be some new level of spirituality for you in marriage.
[time=2579] Singles have given freedom freedom to suffer and difficult assignments and freedom to seize the limited opportunities and that really leads us to the next point.
[time=2589] Freedom to serve an undistracted devotion to God verses 32 and 35 look at this is unbelievable.
[time=2597] But I want you to be free from concern one who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord how he may please the Lord.
[time=2606] But one who is married is concerned about the things of the world how he may please his wife and his interests are divided.
[time=2614] And the woman who is married and the Virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord that she may be who is unmarried and the Virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord that she may be holy both in body and spirit.
[time=2626] But one who is married is concerned about the things of the world how she may please her husband and this I say for your own benefit not to put a restraint upon you but to promote what is seemingly and to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[time=2642] Well, as we read through that you see several times the word concern free from concern in verse 32 concern in verse 33 undivided interests in verse 34 down all the way to this last little phrase in the end of verse 35 to secure undistracted devotion to the Lord.
[time=2659] And Paul sets up this kind of dichotomy that the people who are married really have to think about their marriage and the world in a way that the single people don't.
[time=2668] And he says the freedom that the single people have is they can be totally undistracted in their devotion to the Lord.
[time=2674] That's kind of a, I mean, a great a little bit on me as a married person because I, I mean, I don't attribute my lack of devotion to God because I'm married.
[time=2683] I mean, that's my problem. If I want to be more devoted to God than I'd just be more devoted to God and I don't want to blame that on my wife or my kids.
[time=2689] But that's clearly what he's saying.
[time=2691] Let me try to give a little perspective to it.
[time=2694] If a person is single, they can commune with the Lord and serve the Lord and focus in on the Lord in ways that the married person can't.
[time=2705] I remember when I was a new believer 20 years old or so and obviously unmarried then I didn't get married for a little while later.
[time=2714] I had, I had a couple things I had to do in life.
[time=2717] I had to go to school and get good grades.
[time=2719] I had to do, I had to eat, I had to sleep and then I studied the Bible.
[time=2726] That's all I had to do.
[time=2728] And I got so excited about that. I put a card table up there in my room.
[time=2731] I was living with my folks at the time and I put a card table up there with my Bible and my concordance and my commentaries on the book of Romans.
[time=2738] And I'm telling you, if I wasn't studying, eating or sleeping, I was sitting in that chair, communing with God, learning the Bible, studying the Word of God.
[time=2746] And then I got married and it all changed.
[time=2750] It was horrible.
[time=2752] What was she doing in my life?
[time=2755] We ended up in this studio apartment at USC that wasn't as big as this stage and a headroom for a bed and a room for a kitchen and a little door into the bathroom.
[time=2765] There was no room for my card table anywhere in the studio apartment and there wouldn't have been time if there were.
[time=2772] And what is this thing walking around in this room? Why can't I get my undistracted devotion to the Lord? Where are my hours and hours and hours of Bible study?
[time=2781] It's gone. I've never recaptured it until you hired me.
[time=2787] Now I spend 30 hours a week and I shut my door and I unplugged my phone and I get my undistracted devotion that way.
[time=2793] You understand when you get married there is a different dimension that comes into your life. God has given the human being limitations, limited time, limited mental capacity,
[time=2805] emotional capacity, limited energy and it forces the human being to make priorities and make choices.
[time=2812] And when one chooses to be married there is a significant commitment to love and honor and cherish and develop and cultivate that relationship.
[time=2822] Every now and then Heidi and the kids, when we lived out in California, we'd go visit their family and so there I am for a weak bachelor again.
[time=2829] And I didn't know what to do with all my time and so outcome the books and outcomes this opportunity I can visit over there.
[time=2834] And it's just a reminder that when I am married and I do have my kids there is a forced choice over and over and over again of meeting their needs and ways that I believe honors God.
[time=2847] Now I want to say a little bit further about this devotion stuff. I think if you are married you better be distracted by your wife and you better be distracted by your husband.
[time=2856] You ought to be consumed with them. This isn't just duties that take us away from our devotion to the Lord in that sense.
[time=2863] It's more than food, it's more than clothing, it's more than a house, it's more than children's education.
[time=2868] First Timothy 5 says, "If anyone does not provide for his own and especially for those of his household he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever." I mean that's basic to Christianity as men and husbands we've got to provide.
[time=2879] But it goes beyond the duties to an entire commitment of heart and soul which he seeks to develop in his relationship with his wife.
[time=2888] Whereby he not only understands his wife but deeply touches her longings in meaningful ways. You know what wives want, wives want to feel that in the heart and soul of that man called my husband he has directed his energy and his life force if you will at me.
[time=2905] What aggravates women more than anything else is he's just performing duties. He's just profundly moving through the responsibilities of husband. They don't want that, they want you, they want all of you.
[time=2916] They want to know that when you get up in the morning you're committed to them as a human being and there's something inside your soul moving towards them in a very powerful way. That's called being distracted.
[time=2926] Just so happens when you're married it's the kind of distraction God wants you to have. I measure my devotion to the Lord more by how committed I am to my wife than how committed I am to my Bible study.
[time=2939] Man that's the test isn't it and we'll see that when we get back into first Timothy and look at the qualifications of eldership. The same is true of a woman.
[time=2947] She who is married is distracted verse 34 at the end of it there one who is married is concerned about the things of the world how she may please her husband and we know the incredible responsibilities and the load of work that comes with being a wife and a mother.
[time=2965] Endless responsibilities of providing food and the home and the clothing and a place to retire in the evening and the atmosphere that is warm and inviting and Christian like that doesn't just happen that happens with a lot of hard work.
[time=2982] Anytime my wife leaves the house and doesn't take the kids with me and I'm left with the kids for a day or two I'm immediately reminded of how hard that is and how incredibly industrious she is and how capable she is to do all of that.
[time=2994] It's distracting it's hard but even beyond her duties what I want from her and what we as men would want from our wives is the direction of her heart and her soul that is coming towards me as an individual to receive my leadership and respond to my love and as she gives herself to all that it means to be a woman in reaching and deepening the relationship that she has with me.
[time=3019] That's distracting but it's the right kind of distraction as the Lord evaluates the wife also I believe ultimately the best test for your love of God as a wife is how effectively am I loving and pursuing and honoring and giving myself to my husband.
[time=3037] And those are in the best of marriages. What happens when you have people who have likes and dislikes and characteristics and emotions and temperaments and wills and certain degrees of anger and selfishness and dishonesty and pride and forgetfulness and thoughtfulness in one of the partners who isn't so interested in all of this being devoted to my husband.
[time=3058] Then you're really distracted because you're serving someone who isn't serving the Lord as they ought. Marriage is involved conflicts demands hardships sacrifices and adjustments that singles do not have.
[time=3075] So the single person can be free in a way free to undestracted devotion to the Lord. I think of a lady by the name of Harriet is she she's been here to our church she was the secretary to the president at the master's college for some 25 years and she was this she has the gift of singleness.
[time=3094] She now works for Bob Provost at that send international and as I watched her at the college for those five or six years I was I was awestruck at the capacity not only of work but of devotion in her heart to that institution which she had served for some 25 years and while the president was clearly in charge and directing and leading the show.
[time=3112] So this woman was absolutely totally dedicated to God's work going forward in that school and because of her endless sacrifices financially and time and the heart that she brought in the way that bled out through the rest of the college campus knowing that miss issue was on campus and she was committed and she was the one that took in the kids at Thanksgiving and she was the one that took in the kids at the at the other holidays of Christmas and she was always available to meet any need that might be there.
[time=3139] In a way that many of us who were married simply couldn't be she impacted the organization in a powerful way singles can do that they can reach a level of devotion undistracted devotion to the Lord and to his service that many times married people can.
[time=3156] He says I don't say this as a restraint I don't say this in some way to hold you back look at in verse 35 this I say for your own benefit not to put a restraint upon you but to promote what is seemingly in other words the word restraint literally would be a lasu or a noose with a slip not in it that they would use to capture some animal he said I'm not trying to capture you and take away your freedom you know I want to give this to you as a level of freedom and devotion that others can't experience this is wonderful.
[time=3185] This is wonderful this is to be greatly valued spend it use it take it honor it.
[time=3198] So Paul gives us these three opportunities or privileges or freedoms of singleness the freedom to suffer in difficult assignments the freedom to seize the limited opportunities and the freedom to serve the Lord and undistracted devotion.
[time=3214] It's quite different isn't it from what the world offers us in all their magazines and all the approach to the single life and to being able to be self absorbed in all that.
[time=3226] I think of a lady by the name of Leslie Francis who was our tour guide when we were in China Leslie also has the gift of singleness she's been studying Chinese history basically all of her life I mean since she was in high school because she had this compelling thing in her heart for the people of China.
[time=3243] She speaks the language fluently she has her doctrine in some period of Chinese history this woman has absolutely given every single ounce of her life and her time and her ability to serve the Lord in a very unique way and you know what she does she takes trips into China.
[time=3259] She primarily has a tourist and she carries this huge suitcase and huge backpack she's a sturdy woman and she moves in and about the cities of China within ease and a grace speaking their language knowing their history and she touches base with so many of those home churches that otherwise we wouldn't even know exist.
[time=3279] If they prevent her from leaving she would probably be happier about that she can only go in for so many days on her visa she has no strings no ties she is utterly free to serve an absolute devotion in a very difficult situation.
[time=3295] That's your challenge single people. If indeed God has given you the gift of singleness if that flame is quenched if that burning desire is able to be handled without a constant distraction of the need for marriage God has given you that gift for these purposes to serve him in that kind of way.
[time=3314] You say well that's fine but I don't have the gift of singleness as you described it I'm single but that's not me you're talking about a freedom from distraction I am utterly distracted with things like what is her name when am I going to meet her what is she going to look like how is all of this going to play out I don't have the gift of singleness I am on this holding pattern waiting for God to get on with my life how do I cope with that how do I live what am I supposed to do.
[time=3343] Now you're supposed to come back next week because next week we're going to talk about the blisters of being single why don't we stand together as we conclude our time.
