[time=0] So we've been talking about being single, we've been talking about the bliss of being single that God has set some aside and given them divine enablement to enable them to live without the intimacy of marriage, but this morning we are going to talk about the blisters of being single.
[time=17] Talk about those people who have not been given that divine enablement and yet in obedience to God are living without a mate.
[time=24] How are they to pursue Christ in such a situation?
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] Today Pastor Moore continues his series on singles. He has entitled today's message "The Bliss and Blisters of Singleness" Part 3.
[time=58] Most individuals probably would not plan in the early stages of their lives to remain single. Marriage and family are considered to be more normal.
[time=66] Does God really expect some individuals to remain single? What are the positive and negative aspects of being single?
[time=73] Today's message is the first in this series from first Corinthians. Our special music today will include our sanctuary choir singing at the name of Jesus and reflection singing passed through the waters.
[time=88] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's listen to Read La Favour singing "He Touched Me".
[time=104] I was shackled by a hearth with a load of guilt and shame when the hand of Jesus touched me.
[time=130] And all the wrongdoings of sins for He touched me.
[time=142] Oh yes, He touched me.
[time=148] Oh, the children of Jesus touched me.
[time=159] And all the wrongdoings of sins for He touched me.
[time=174] Now ever since I miss my blessings, Savior, and ever since He touched me and made me grow.
[time=192] Oh, I will never cease to praise You.
[time=201] I'll shout while eternity is because He touched me.
[time=213] Oh yes, my Lord, touch me and all the joy that floods my soul.
[time=228] And now I know that something really happened and now I know that something happened and now I know that He touched me.
[time=256] Oh, my Lord, reach down and touch me and all the joy that floods my soul.
[time=270] Something happened and now I know that He touched me.
[time=289] Oh, my Lord, touch me and all the joy that floods my soul.
[time=309] [APPLAUSE]
[time=340] [MUSIC]
[time=368] Taking the form of a servant and becoming like man.
[time=383] [MUSIC]
[time=403] We all love Himself. We all love Himself.
[time=414] [MUSIC - 23 seconds]
[time=466] And the name of Jesus, and the name of Jesus.
[time=500] And the name of Jesus Christ is Christ.
[time=514] [MUSIC]
[time=541] And the name of Jesus.
[time=552] I hope that this day finds all of you in good spirits.
[time=561] We have had some cold weather here in Indiana and a lot of snow, but we're enjoying it.
[time=565] It's a quite a change from the summer season that we have in a few months to come.
[time=570] We're glad that you joined us for the Bible hour today and we want to remind you that the Sing for Joy concert is coming up very soon here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=579] It will be on February 8th.
[time=581] That concert is a compilation of a number of contestants that have been competing in the last couple weeks and they'll be singing.
[time=590] And then we have a special guest, Jeffrey Benward, that will be with us on Saturday evening February 8th at 7 p.m.
[time=597] I hope that you'll come being great encouragement to hear some of our soloists from the area and then Jeffrey Benward.
[time=603] Come and join with us on February 8th.
[time=606] Russell, you've been involved in the Singles ministry as far as you're preaching and talking about the bliss and the blisters of being single.
[time=614] And we have a guest today. I think you ought to introduce them.
[time=617] I'm sure to most of you, Kevin Roe, who we're so thankful for his ministry at Black Hawk Baptist Church and on the Bible hour, gifted voice and vocalist and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=628] Kevin, you're a part of our Singles group and we were thinking it might be nice for you to share with the people in the Bible hour, some of the things that are going on there, the kind of ministries that are occurring.
[time=639] Well, I think I've been in that Singles group for about 14 years now. It hardly seems possible, but the class for us, so many of us, has been such a blessing in many ways.
[time=649] Rather than trying to focus on being single and what it's like to be single, I think what we try to do in the class is more or less focus on being godly.
[time=657] And I think that centers around the whole thing, being fulfilled, whether you're married or single, depends entirely on whether you're committed to Christ and if you're doing his work.
[time=665] And that's what we really try to do in the class is focus on that. The class is big enough that we have enough people that we can share with and share lives with and get encouragement from and encourage each other, and yet small enough that you can get to know other people.
[time=678] That's been a real blessing in everyone's lives.
[time=680] How big is the class? What are some of the things you do as far as activities and fellowship opportunities?
[time=685] We're averaging about 60 to 70 every week now and bursting at the seams all the time. We have a regular outreach every month where we go out into some service area in the community.
[time=697] We might go to the crisis pregnancy center and help them paint or clean up or go to the rescue mission and cook a meal, so we do that once every month.
[time=704] And we also have just a regular fellowship outside this month we went skiing, last month we had a Christmas outing and we went caroling, so we do something different every month.
[time=714] And then we have an after-goal also where we get together once a month on a Sunday evening after the evening service and talk about what's going on in our lives and share with each other.
[time=721] And it's just more of a spiritual time for us.
[time=723] Well, that's great, Kevin. We're excited about what the Lord is doing in and through you and the other singles of our church, tremendous resource, strength and godliness and you make a huge impact on our church or thankful you were part of it.
[time=737] Thanks.
[time=738] Kevin is one of many of our singles that contribute in the music program. Kevin, we're sure glad you're here and the others you give us a lot of spirit and encouragement even in our sanctuary choir.
[time=748] Thank you for joining us today.
[time=750] Thank you. This is the last day that we're going to talk about fresh moments, the devotional that's put out by the Bible hour and we'd like to have you receive it absolutely free.
[time=759] It's a devotional where you read a portion of scripture in every day and there's a thought for the day and then there are other interesting articles written by Christian men.
[time=768] We'd like to have you receive this and you can receive it absolutely free. If you'll write to the Bible hour today, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=780] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=789] Once again, we want to thank you for joining us on the Bible hour. We'll go back to the live portion of our services.
[time=794] We hear music from reflection and then the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore. Stay with us.
[time=824] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[time=834] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. For I am the Lord, your God.
[time=846] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[time=858] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. For I am the Lord, your God.
[time=870] Do not be afraid, I am with you. You are precious and honored in my sight.
[time=882] We're not for I have redeemed you. I have called you by name and you are mine.
[time=894] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[time=906] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. For I am the Lord, your God.
[time=918] God is still on the throne and he lies the way for his own.
[time=930] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[time=942] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. For I am the Lord, your God.
[time=954] When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. When you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you.
[time=966] When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. For I am the Lord, your God.
[time=976] For I am the Lord, your God.
[time=992] Amen. Thank you, reflection. We are so blessed here with the talent that God has given us to help us worship.
[time=1008] Over and over again, I am thankful for all the people that contribute so significantly to our ministry here as a church.
[time=1016] One of the relationships for which I am particularly thankful that God brought into my life was the one I enjoyed with Dr. Charles Russell Smith.
[time=1028] He was a great theologian, outstanding brilliant mind, clear thinker of difficult issues in theology.
[time=1038] I remember sharing with him one day he was just talking about his life and how he was when he was a younger man after he completed his doctorate and was teaching on the faculty.
[time=1048] He went at 9 o'clock, call one of his other friends there on the faculty and they would take turns reading to each other simultaneously translating the Greek New Testament as they would spend the evening there for a couple of hours.
[time=1062] They would do that regularly, just to gargant you in mind, oversaw many doctoral programs and was able to give tremendous insight, wrote a number of books and just a great, great man of God.
[time=1074] And I am indebted to the Lord for Chuck because of all that he taught me and what he taught me really wasn't in the classroom or the way in which he taught me because I was never one of his students.
[time=1084] He came to be the vice president of the Master's Seminary when I was the vice president of the Master's College.
[time=1090] And our offices were just across the hall from each other and through the four years that the Lord gave us together I was able to lean on his maturity and on his wisdom to learn a number of things.
[time=1102] Not only this one keepsake of our relationship, it's a postcard.
[time=1107] I didn't get any of his theology volumes or any of his notes out of his file cabinets which I probably had my eye on in some way or another.
[time=1115] Instead I remember his returning from an excursion that he had up the coast of Central California.
[time=1123] And he came into my office and dropped this on the desk and I immediately knew what it was about because he had told me a story about it earlier.
[time=1129] There were three sea otters laying out in the Pacific Ocean basking up the sun.
[time=1136] Chuck was dying of cancer the last year or so that I knew him.
[time=1140] When the doctor told him that he had but six months to live in addition to spending a great amount of time with his family which he did, his sons that he loved and his wife.
[time=1148] And he took trips back to the south from when he had come and saw where he had been raised and where his parents had lived in the town in which he had grown up.
[time=1156] He spent a lot of time doing those kinds of things just kind of seizing the last few days of life.
[time=1162] When he wasn't doing that he enjoyed taking a drive in his car over to the coast of Central California and finding a sand dune to sit on or some rock on a jetty somewhere and just thinking about life and really grappling with God as to the why of his sickness.
[time=1179] And as this great theologian who had studied the word of God all of his life and knew it better than most I knew would sit there and struggle with his own cancer and a sovereign God and a sinful world and the questions that you can imagine were running through his mind.
[time=1193] Why do I have to die so young probably 20 years earlier than his life expectancy?
[time=1199] Why is it that I won't be able to continue to love my wife and my sons and their grandchildren or my grandchildren?
[time=1206] Why is it that I'm now in this fruitful ministry and the seminary is growing and we're having an impact training up godly men to change the world for Christ?
[time=1215] Why is it that I'm going to be cut short of all I had dreamed in that new venture?
[time=1221] And as he struggled with that in sharp contrast to all of his confusion and his questions and his turmoil were these sea otters.
[time=1229] That would frolic in the ocean, only 25 to 50 yards off the coast and we're clearly in view. It was their habit and pattern to play in the kelp beds and when they had eaten their fold then to come to the surface and their buoyant bodies would allow them to effortlessly just lay there and pitch and rock with the ocean and pop their little heads up at a right angle and they would dry off and their heads would become really dry fur.
[time=1252] They'd look like puppy dog heads and they'd just kind of look around and just enjoy life and slap themselves on their belly and kind of croak and bark and communicate and you know they didn't have a care in the world and they caught Chuck's attention because of that.
[time=1267] They didn't know if they had cancer or not. They had no feeling for a mate, for children, for grandchildren, for frustrated dreams and ministry that will never come true at least by his own hand or their own hand.
[time=1280] They were enjoying the bliss of ignorance being animals. On the back of this postcard Chuck wrote this, "Rus, though this is nice, dash, obviously referring to previous conversations we had had about his understanding of the sea otters and how blissful their existence was.
[time=1304] Though this is nice, dash, you were made for something much better and the underlying is much and puts an exclamation point after the word better and then signs it Chuck."
[time=1315] In a way that was his saying goodbye to me in wrapping up in that brief little sentence and in the experiences of those otters much of what he had tried to live and much of what he had tried to teach me.
[time=1331] So what did he conclude about life? Life is hard. Over and over again he would remind me that we are living in a fallen world, that though we are redeemed, though we are new in Christ, we are still fallen people living in a fallen world and life is not always what it's supposed to be.
[time=1351] Back life is really never what it's ultimately designed to be by God as we would have enjoyed it as sinless creatures in the Garden of Eden.
[time=1360] But he would always hasten to add to our times of discussion and to my perspective that as hard as life is, he would rather live it as a human being struggling to face the hardship therein and find a way to live with purpose and meaning to the glory of God.
[time=1379] He would have this pseudo existence as a sea otter, not created in the image of God, not able to relate its own existence to God and to other human beings.
[time=1392] He would rather face the challenge of living for God in a world that had been marred by sin and as he was dying of cancer, he knew better the mar of sin than the rest of us who live under the illusion that we're not really dying when in reality all of us are, just a matter of timing.
[time=1408] So the question is what has that got to do with singles?
[time=1413] Well, I would ask you to remember we're going to talk this morning not about singles with the gift of singleness who have been given the divine enablement to live outside of the intimacy of marriage.
[time=1425] We're going to talk about singles today who really were built for marriage, who were created for marriage, who have this longing, this drive, this craving for the wonder and the intimacy that God has given in the design of marriage but who are not married?
[time=1441] Who do not find satisfaction for that? People who like Chuck are asking why? Why is my life like this? Why isn't it another way?
[time=1457] And I would offer a couple of immediate reasons for the answer why, I mean suggestions, maybe your time hasn't come yet. Maybe you're not married yet because the Lord is going to do that for you in a couple of years and your 18 or 19 or 20 or 24 or 25 and that's kind of around the corner and though you can't see it and though there are no immediate prospects, God's going to resolve that in your life and he's asking you to just wait for a few years.
[time=1483] For others of you it may be a difficult and traumatic past you may have been raised in a really hard family what they call a dysfunctional family and there is in you all kinds of fear and trauma and paranoia about anything that looks like marriage because you saw it the way it was in your household and you don't want any part of it and you're fearful that if you get in it you'll repeat it in some way or another and there's just too much stuff going on inside of you maybe a bunch of stuff you've never even identified.
[time=1511] Or maybe that stuff is going on inside the person you're dating and you wonder why they won't come to the place of making a final and full commitment and maybe some of that has to do with their past and what's going on and nobody's had the time to help and think through and discover and repent of some really foolish thoughts about God and about marriage and about people and about relationships.
[time=1531] So the two of you repel each other like magnets. Maybe you're torn between two lovers. Maybe you've had this zeal for a career and for education and for a kind of lifestyle that has just been all consuming and only as of light you've begun to realize it's not really everything you thought it would be and now surfacing again is this incredible desire to be marriage maybe surfacing for the first time but you've made no preparation.
[time=1558] There are no relationships in your life. You've been too busy. You've been gone. You've been preoccupied. Maybe your single because of some divorce biblical or unbiblical or some death and God through his sovereign providence has allowed your loved one, your kindred spirit to be taken from you and the thought of another taking his place or her place is unacceptable and so you live alone.
[time=1587] Maybe you're coming to the conclusion that you're unlovely and unloved and unattached. Maybe that conclusion is really being driven home in some painful ways that you suspected all your life but now it's just too obvious. It's just too clear.
[time=1607] Maybe it's something about your physical appearance. Maybe it's something about your mental capacities. Maybe it's something about your personality. Maybe it's just something that leaves you with the aching reality that nobody wants me.
[time=1621] There are probably a list many others that could be added to this list and I don't know if you can ever figure out exactly what God might be doing in your life or why or what the circumstances are.
[time=1632] I'm not even sure we need to figure that out. What is clear is that in your life there is an unmet longing and it's real and it hurts.
[time=1644] Receive a letter this week from one of our singles and enjoyed reading it. After opening and discussing some of the unique ministry opportunities that this particular single enjoys and some of the special ways that this person has seen God move in their life
[time=1661] because of their singleness and availability to him than this paragraph. I know you will be speaking on the blisters of being single. Since I am familiar with these also I wanted to just touch on a few which you may not realize.
[time=1676] First there are the empty arms. Sometimes when it's been a rough day it would be good to have someone to hug me. Just to tell me I'm okay.
[time=1688] That was an interesting thought. I can't tell you how many times I go home and the first thing I want is a hug from my wife and how reassuring that feels.
[time=1699] Then there are other times where that is really being sought of me.
[time=1704] There are also those days of empty arms when I see a little child all dressed up with that angelic smile. I sometimes wonder what it would feel like to have a little angel of my own.
[time=1717] I wonder if I will soon need to come to the acceptance that my arms may never hold such a child.
[time=1724] I'm sure that God has the grace and love to uphold me. It goes on. Another blister is the view others may have of me as a single. Sometimes there is the comment I can't believe you are still single.
[time=1739] Which implies I wonder what's so wrong with you that no one wants you or there can't be any good reason to be your age and still single.
[time=1752] Whether you're going to be single for six months or single for the rest of your life. You are faced with the challenge of living a life that from one perspective really isn't as it ought to be.
[time=1767] In other words, if the fall had not occurred, it wouldn't have been this way. You wouldn't have felt the emptiness. You wouldn't have felt the longing and you wouldn't have felt the hurt and the pain.
[time=1778] My sister-in-law lived with us the last six years before I moved -- Heidi and I moved here to Indiana. It was a great privilege to have her in our home. A lovely sweet young lady.
[time=1788] She moved in with us after she graduated from high school and was with us from about her age 18 to 24. And she enjoyed a really fun and exciting high school career.
[time=1798] She'd been in athletics and done well in her studies and been a part of some of the student body leadership. And when she came and lived in with us, she jumped into a strong, vibrant church and was a part of a college group and was active in that and taking leadership roles and finding opportunities to serve.
[time=1816] It was really almost just a picture perfect existence. And then one of her girlfriends came over and walked in and they huddled up in her bedroom and shut the door and then you heard the explosion of joy and laughter and screams and the girlfriend had said, "I'm engaged."
[time=1835] And then she was asked to be in the wedding. And so, you know what you do. You go out and buy one of those dresses that you only wear once in your life.
[time=1843] And that cost a lot of money. And she was just excited about the wedding and all the things that went on and enjoyed the whole thing. And that passed and then another girl came over and they huddled up in the room and the explosion of laughter and joy and she was in another wedding. And she bought another dress.
[time=1860] And then she bought another one and another one and another one and another one and she'd been in about nine weddings.
[time=1873] And pretty soon everybody that she had been building relationships with all those years since she lived with us was married.
[time=1881] And when she'd go to her closet she'd see nine monuments of her singleness, of her singleness and their marriedness.
[time=1894] And I can remember as we progressed through that, just hurting in my heart for her as I saw her hurt.
[time=1900] And as I saw her really questioned God and there were times where we would unusually cold California day or night make a fire and sit down and have a cup of coffee and tea and talk till late into the evening with Heidi and Heidi's sister and hurt with her and cry with her.
[time=1918] And she would ask all the questions about her God and about herself and was it her appearance or was it her mind or was it her personality or was she in sin or was she supposed to have married that guy that she dated for a few months and decided that wasn't right and did she make a mistake and now she stuck with the rest of and am I going to be an old maid and all the hopes and dreams that she's had all of her life to be a wife and a mother.
[time=1944] We had some rich times together but I'll never forget the pain that I saw in her eyes as she wondered, you know, is this all just am I just not going to make it and her self image would just crash through the bottom.
[time=1960] I was listening to a tape by Chuck Swindall and not particularly on this topic but I think it relates I want to share it with you he said it this way Physician Scott Peck calls it the road less travel.
[time=1972] Scholar CS Lewis refers to it as God's megaphone.
[time=1978] Contemporary author Philip Yancy says that it is the gift nobody wants English poet Byron referred to it as the path to truth.
[time=1992] But no one ever said it better than Isaac Watts the him writer as he asked direct and searching questions am I a soldier of the cross am I a follower of the lamb.
[time=2005] Must I be carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease while others fought to win the prize and sailed through bloody seas.
[time=2015] He was referring to pain he went on to say it is in pain that God speaks to us through his megaphone suffering is the road less traveled.
[time=2029] Affliction is the path to truth hard ship and adversity these are the gifts nobody wants.
[time=2041] But everybody needs.
[time=2044] That's good in it.
[time=2048] Philippians chapter one would you come there with me for a minute I want to kind of survey just a few passages.
[time=2065] Philippians chapter one verses 27 and following you remember Paul's in prison.
[time=2078] He's wondering if he'll live to get out of prison he debates back and forth of himself about that in verses 19 to about 25.
[time=2086] Verse 27, "Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that whether I come and see you or remain absent I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel."
[time=2103] Striving verse 28, "In no way alarmed by your opponents which is a sign of destruction for them but of salvation for you and that too from God."
[time=2116] Now verse 29, "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me."
[time=2131] And now here to be in me.
[time=2137] You know I don't believe we have to be locked up in Rome for our faith before that verse applies to us.
[time=2146] That it has been granted for Christ's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake I believe that we suffer as believers when we make every effort to live for God and yet are still fallen and still sinful
[time=2160] and make mistakes in our lives and that is compounded by a sinful world that is hostile and that is unaccommodating and that is nowhere near what we were created for in heaven.
[time=2171] I believe we suffer as we in that circumstance try to live for God.
[time=2178] There are someone who would say that all suffering is wrong. All suffering is the product of sin and is the direct result of your being out of the will of God.
[time=2192] Confess your sin they'll say get right with God. Put yourself in the place of blessing and stop this suffering.
[time=2202] They're liars. They're wrong. It's not true. The Bible never says it. Stop believing it. Stop listening to it.
[time=2212] It's hard to live the Christian life and there is an abundance of suffering that comes in an abundance of forms.
[time=2221] You can come with me if you like over to 2 Corinthians chapter 4. Verse 8.
[time=2245] We're afflicted in every way but not crushed.
[time=2250] Perplexed but not despairing. Persecuted but not forsaken.
[time=2259] Struck down but not destroyed. Verse 10. Always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
[time=2276] By bearing up under the death like life of Christianity we experience and enter into the life of Christ.
[time=2289] A little further back in the New Testament. 1 Peter chapter 4.
[time=2310] Verse 12. Be lovable. Do not be surprised at the fire or deal among you. Don't be surprised.
[time=2321] Which comes upon you for your testing as though some strange thing were happening to you.
[time=2327] Verse 13. But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ keep on rejoicing so that also at the revelation of his glory you may rejoice with exaltation.
[time=2339] Peter warns us not to perceive the difficulties of our lives the fire or deals in this case literal persecution but I would broaden it in our Christian life to those experiences which are so contradictory to what we have been created to experience as image bearers in a perfect place called heaven and will one day experience as image bearers in a perfect place called heaven.
[time=2362] When those come upon you don't think it says if some strange thing out of the ordinary remarkable exceptional every now and then type thing.
[time=2373] Verse 13. But to the degree that you share them that you enter into those that you maintain your commitment to obedience in light of them or in spite of them and continue to move through them.
[time=2385] There is a basis for rejoicing a rejoicing what kind of a rejoicing not a rejoicing in the circumstances themselves know but that in the suffering you can pursue Christ you can pursue godliness you can pursue his aims and his objectives and his goals and out of that comes of rejoicing and then look so that at the revelation of his glory you may rejoice with exaltation.
[time=2411] It always ends up there whenever the Bible talks about difficult circumstances whenever the Bible talks about the suffering and the turmoil of life we are inevitably led to the reality that one day at the revelation of his glory you will rejoice with exaltation.
[time=2431] You will be in heaven you will be where you are supposed to be where you are created to be and that is really introducing us to this doctrine or to this theology of hope.
[time=2443] It is a great and powerful theme and it fills the scriptures and I just want to continue to develop it a little bit with you this morning and probably next Lord's day.
[time=2456] To do that I ask you to come to Romans chapter 8 and I'm not going to go to the verses you might be thinking of the real famous ones you know about God causing all things to work together for good that's Romans 828 I'd like you to stop at Romans 823.
[time=2483] And not only this but also we ourselves having the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves in verse 22 you find the description of the fallen world that Chuck would so often describe for me for we know that the whole creation groans and suffers the pains of childbirth together until now.
[time=2512] And that is just a broad descriptive way to describe all the consequences of sin that beset the world and Satan and his demonic schemes to run people into the ground and to deceive them of the truth and to make their life miserable and in his greatest hour of triumph for any individual to bring them even to the place of committing suicide.
[time=2532] He loves death. He loves murder. He loves when people murder themselves because he has so thoroughly deluded them and convinced them of the emptiness of life.
[time=2542] So we are living in a fallen place and we have all the demonic forces to contend with and the culture that it establishes and the lies that it propagates that infiltrate our lives to what we read and what we see and what we hear when we talk with people who do not think as the Bible teaches us to think and it all comes together.
[time=2559] But in addition to that not only is that there but verse 23 not only this but also we ourselves having the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves.
[time=2573] The word grown there means to sigh means to just you can picture somebody kind of slumping their soldiers under the reality of undesirable circumstances and just kind of exhaling the pressure in their soul as they are forced to face what it is their life brings them today.
[time=2597] Paul knowing his own life and directed by the spirit of God chose to put that word grown in the present tense which would emphasize the continual nature of his groaning.
[time=2607] This was not an every now and then thing. This would have been something that he would characterize his life by even as a believer and the brief study of his life would confirm that that was the case.
[time=2620] And there is such wisdom in his words the beginning of this doctrine of hope the beginning of this coming into the reality of hoping in God and waiting for the future that future place called heaven is right here in the groaning right here in the slumping of the shoulders and the exhaling of the pressure and the honestly facing how much life isn't like what it was supposed to be.
[time=2649] People who don't sigh are in danger and I'm speaking and thinking really of singles at this point though it could be applied in a broader context of several things.
[time=2658] I'll call them syndromes that I've kind of noticed in people through my brief life.
[time=2663] The first is that I'm going to fix it syndrome singles who are tired of feeling the pain and groaning under its weight resolve in their mind and their hearts to fix it.
[time=2675] I'm going to fix it. I'm going to change it and so they get themselves all dolled up in some cases and other cases the single men run off to the weight room and try to put their body in a one top condition and then they sometimes run to the store and buy all the latest fads and then interact with the right groups and
[time=2692] try to play the right part and have the right personality and then if their Christians they're apt to add multiplied hours in the Bible and prayer and obedience to try to somehow obligate God and twist his arm and earn some this mate earn the reward of obedience.
[time=2714] It's a long way from groaning. Another syndrome I've seen is that I don't need it. I don't need it syndrome so painful is the loneliness so painful is sometimes the social stigma of being unloved and unattached and unwanted.
[time=2730] The anger bruised to an anti-marriage posture which only reveals bitter anger underneath a very thin veneer and there are men and women that we know who are single who just seem to be aloof from the need for marriage even though deep down inside they're hurting and they're angry and they only say they don't want to be married or aren't interested in it or it could really take it or leave it in some nonchalant way because they're just so sick and tired of having to face the pain.
[time=2759] It's the pain of really just being honest and open and saying it really hurts. I'm single and I wish I weren't.
[time=2766] There's another syndrome that I won't feel it syndrome. I refused to feel it. I felt it long enough and out of this group of people we gather are workaholics.
[time=2779] We gather our entertainment aaholics, people who are endlessly seeking the latest entertainment whether it be a movie or a new CD or a television or a sport or whatever it is and they just consume that and keep that flowing as fast as they can or our ministry aaholics even in the church.
[time=2800] We gather our alcoholics, our adrenaline addicts, our sex addicts, people who have driven themselves in their lives to one long repetitive sequence of having to have the next thrill.
[time=2814] Some good, some intrinsically moral, some sinful activities but always more is needed to help numb the pain. Never get enough.
[time=2827] All of these are really a far cry from what Paul says we're supposed to do with the pain of life to groan.
[time=2837] As a single, I would implore you to struggle to be able to say yes. Yes, I would much rather be married and I will be open to marriage.
[time=2849] But I will continue to be vulnerable. I will continue to risk the exposure. I will continue to stay soft as the spirit of God allows that and groan and sigh rather than to adopt one of these other approaches.
[time=2868] Some of you are saying, "Well, that doesn't sound like very good advice." Get a bunch of people single out there and they start groaning and sighing. Nobody wants to be around a mopey, dopey sour puss.
[time=2877] I mean, aren't you really giving them bad advice there? I mean, that makes them less attractive. I mean, that's never going to solve their problem.
[time=2884] A bunch of people sitting around feeling sorry for themselves that nobody wants them or that God hasn't answered their prayer yet or that life isn't all they want it to be. That doesn't sound like a very attractive group of people.
[time=2895] And I say to that, I guess that groaning could lead to that. I guess I have seen that. I've seen people who have groaned and faced the reality of what they wanted and it has led them into some kind of an immobilizing morbid introspection where they are of no heavenly, nor earthly good.
[time=2912] And they just have pity parties and went after the other. But that's certainly not the result that it brought in Paul's life.
[time=2918] What are the groaning due to Paul? Look at it again in verse 23. Romans 8, "Not only this, but also we ourselves having the first fruit of the spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves." What?
[time=2931] Waiting eagerly for our adoption as sons, the redemption of our body. Somehow, Paul was able to allow that hardship in his life, the circumstances, the unmet desires, and in groaning for them out of that groaning came an eager expectation for Christ, and for the day, the adoption as sons, the redemption of his body. He's talking about eternity. He's talking about heaven.
[time=2956] Somehow, that groaning and that pain worked together as a catalyst for great godliness and great strength of character and great purpose in his life.
[time=2968] AWS Tozer said it this way, "It is doubtful that God can use anyone greatly until He has hurt him deeply." It is doubtful that God can use anyone greatly until He has hurt him deeply.
[time=2984] Why? Because out of that pain can come a sense of dependence and a sense of anticipation that what I'm really waiting for is heaven, not the next thrill or not a mate,
[time=2996] or not a promotion, or not a better situation. I'm ultimately waiting only for God and Him in heaven, and so in the interim I'm willing to live with real purpose and real meaning and real strength and real courage instead of using my energies to somehow numb the pain.
[time=3014] Zacharias speaking of the Babylonian captivity called Israel Prisoners of Hope, Prisoners of Hope, powerful phrase, ripped from their homeland, ripped from all that they would normally want in life, stuck in a foreign land.
[time=3034] There they are, Prisoners of Hope. They could do but one thing, hope for the future.
[time=3043] You who are single, allow me to pose the question raised by Herman Hess on this topic. He said, "At this way life passes like a flash of lightning whose blaze barely lasts long enough to see, while the earth and the sky stand still forever how swiftly changing time flies across man's face.
[time=3063] Oh you who sit over your full cup and do not drink, tell me for whom are you still waiting."
[time=3075] Point is don't wait for marriage, wait on God. Learn to wait eagerly on God, not for Him to give you the marriage and for Him to give you the satisfaction of your heart before Him to ultimately take you to glory.
[time=3090] And that hope becomes the all-consuming passion of your life and as such you are willing to live this brief vapor of life, fully embracing your pain but fully living for His glory.
[time=3105] The psalmist said in Psalm 130 verse 5, "I wait for the Lord, my soul does wait." This is a waiting, not an intellectual understanding. This is the stuff that came from within His soul.
[time=3122] Isaiah develops the thought very nicely. You don't need to turn there. I want to just share three verses from the book of Isaiah about waiting and the hope that it can produce and the strength to live.
[time=3133] He begins in Isaiah 8 verse 17, "The people in this part of His prophecy are deep in their Babylonian exile, they are struggling, they are full of hardship." And He says this, "I will wait for the Lord who is hiding His face from the house of Jacob and I will hope in Him."
[time=3153] At this point, it says if the face of the Lord has been hidden from the people and their needs and they cry out but He does not listen. They ask Him to look but He does not see. They ask Him to solve their problems but He does not respond.
[time=3165] He asks them to lighten their burden but no such response comes their way. It says if He has hidden His face and you who are single, you who are single without the gift of singleness and have been that way for some time, you know what that feels like.
[time=3180] You know what He's talking about. God has hidden His face. As the prophecy develops and the hope of the messianic deliverance is brought into the picture almost as if the sun is rising from a dark night.
[time=3197] Isaiah 259 and it will be said in that day behold this is our God for whom we have waited that He might save us. This is the Lord for whom we have waited. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation and once again He calls the people to wait for the actual coming of the Lord and all the deliverance that that would bring into their life.
[time=3217] The salvation. They almost picture Him there and they're rejoicing and saying see we made it. We made it through that period when the face of God had been hidden and we now rejoice in the great and awesome deliverance which He had promised and we now hold it in our hands and cling it to our breasts.
[time=3233] But then later in the prophecy he talks about what happens in between and it's that famous passage that Eric little brought to all the world's consciousness at least those of us who live in America in the movie about Eric little Isaiah 4031.
[time=3250] Yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength. Those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength. They will mount up with wings like eagles. They will run and not get tired. They will walk and not become weary.
[time=3265] That is the secret. That is the painful secret. That is the painful process. That is the doctrine of hope.
[time=3274] It is to fully embrace my life and the disappointments therein. It is to be aware that there is a day coming when my great and awesome God will wipe away all the tears and all the disease and all the sickness and all the loneliness and all the hurts and because that is true in the interim as I hope for Him as I hope for that day I can rise up with new strength.
[time=3297] I can run and not get tired. I can walk and not become weary.
[time=3306] So I encourage you to evaluate what you do in response to the hurt and to the pain.
[time=3317] I want to call you to groan first today and there is more to come I had originally hope to finish this entire message today but there won't be time.
[time=3326] But only for today then let me ask you to spend the next week between now and next evaluating your life, looking at your habits, looking at how you are responding to that disappointment.
[time=3343] Are you in the eye, will fix it syndrome? Are you in the eye, don't care syndrome?
[time=3353] Are you in the eye, will not feel it syndrome? Are you filling your lives with all the things that try to distract you from it?
