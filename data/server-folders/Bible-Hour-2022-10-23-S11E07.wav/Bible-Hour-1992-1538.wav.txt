[time=0] One of the worst persecutors of God's church was Saul of Tarsus.
[time=7] The Bible says that in those days he went from house to house tearing Christians from their homes, beating them and throwing them in prison.
[time=14] But one day, Saul of Tarsus had an experience when he came face to face with Jesus Christ on the Damascus Road.
[time=21] The Bible says that his life was transformed, but that experience was not just for Saul of Tarsus.
[time=27] For everyone who wants to know that they have a home in heaven waiting for them when they pass from this earth.
[time=33] Have you met the Savior Jesus Christ as Paul did that day?
[time=36] Study with us today as we look at the life of Saul of Tarsus, a holy terror who was holy
[time=42] transformed.
[time=57] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=63] Thank you for joining us.
[time=66] In Pastor Moore's absence today, our associate pastor, Jim Pearson, will be bringing us today's message.
[time=72] He is entitled as message, "A Holy Terror is Holy Transformed." Most of us are familiar with the biblical account of the conversion of Saul.
[time=81] How, before his conversion, he openly persecuted the Christians.
[time=85] And how, after his miraculous conversion, he became one of the chief spokesmen for those whom he previously had persecuted.
[time=94] Pastor Pearson's text is taken from the ninth chapter of Acts, verses 1-22.
[time=100] Our special music today will include star-broughtom singing, turn your eyes upon Jesus, and celebration
[time=107] singing in his care.
[time=110] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's listen to the sanctuary choir singing and Tiffany Praise.
[time=144] We worship you, we worship you, we worship you, we worship you, we worship you, we worship you.
[time=372] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=399] I will praise him, I will praise him, I will praise him, I will praise him, I will praise him.
[time=421] I will praise him, I will praise him.
[time=429] I will praise him, I will praise him, I will praise him, I will praise him, I will praise him, I will praise him.
[time=459] Oh, soul, are you weary and troubled, no light in the darkness you see.
[time=485] There's light for a look at the Savior and life more abundant and free.
[time=504] Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face and the things of earth will grow strangely dim.
[time=530] In the light of his glory and grace, his word will not fail you.
[time=545] He promised, believe him and all will be well, then go to a world where his died.
[time=566] His perfect salvation to tell, turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face.
[time=593] And the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace.
[time=613] Turn your eyes upon Jesus and look full in his wonderful face and the things of this world will grow strangely dim.
[time=643] In the light of his glory and grace, in the light of his glory and grace.
[time=673] We're so glad that you tuned in.
[time=682] Last week, our pastor Russell Moore mentioned that he would be gone this week.
[time=686] He's in Arizona at a Bible conference.
[time=688] We're glad he has this opportunity to speak to the church out there and also to get some rest and relaxation.
[time=694] With us today, as you know, at the beginning of the program, is our associate pastor Jim Pearson.
[time=699] Jim's good to have you back again.
[time=700] Pete, it's always good to be here.
[time=701] We look forward to talking about your message in just a little bit and then hearing it.
[time=705] But I'd like to tell you a little bit about the divorce recovery workshop that was mentioned last week during the insert.
[time=712] It will be held at Black Hawk Baptist Church on Friday evening February 21st.
[time=717] It's a very, very important workshop for those of you that involved in divorce and the hurt that it causes.
[time=724] And if you'd like more information about this workshop, you can call the church at 493-7400.
[time=732] That's the divorce recovery workshop on Friday evening February 21st.
[time=737] Call and get some more information if you'd like to become involved in that workshop.
[time=742] While Jim, tell us a little bit about what you're speaking about this morning.
[time=745] Well, Pete, I've titled my message this morning.
[time=747] A holy terror is holy transformed.
[time=750] I think there's no doubt that one of the worst persecutors of the early church was Saul of Tarsus.
[time=755] But what we're speaking about today is the fact that that one day he met Jesus Christ on the Damascus road.
[time=761] And just the Bible just says that his life was holy transformed.
[time=764] He was changed and went from persecutor to preacher.
[time=768] So we're going to talk about the transformed life that comes when you meet Jesus Christ.
[time=772] You know Jim, not only did Jesus change his life at that particular point in time, but I was at a conference last week and a pastor from Brooklyn, New York, spoke and spoke of a man that was at his church just recently and just was the most wretched looking man.
[time=789] In fact, he said he looked like he was about 60 years old when he was 27 years old.
[time=794] But God changed his life after that service.
[time=796] And within a year now that he's completely changed, it looks more like a 27 year old man.
[time=801] And he's working in the church there and Pastor Symbola just said he has really seen a change
[time=807] in this man's life.
[time=808] So God is still working today and changing lives that seem like they're just impossible.
[time=813] He can soften their hearts and change them.
[time=815] So we're looking forward to your message.
[time=817] Thank you very much for speaking to us today.
[time=820] You have other responsibilities.
[time=822] We're going to talk about the book offer that we have this week concerning relationships.
[time=826] Russ has been talking on singleness.
[time=828] I know that you get involved a lot in people's problems and what other responsibilities do
[time=835] you have here, Jim?
[time=836] Well, Pete, let's start there.
[time=837] You know, counseling people is a major part of my responsibility and we all have problems and we all have children and families and marriages and things don't always go perfect.
[time=848] And sometimes we just need somebody to talk to.
[time=851] I try to be there to encourage and to give insight and direction whenever I'm asked.
[time=855] But that's a major part of my work here.
[time=857] I think that's just one thing.
[time=858] We also try to be there for people at the hospital and in the nursing homes ministering to them
[time=864] at those times.
[time=865] And then of course we have a lot of fun on Friday mornings with super 60s and all the programming that we do there and bringing all those people in for those Friday mornings we just have a good time.
[time=876] I know that a number of the super 60s will be watching this morning because some of them can't get out in this cold weather and I know that they are very appreciative of your ministry on Friday mornings, it's always a happy time, even this last Friday morning.
[time=888] I peaked my head in and looked like everybody was having a good time.
[time=893] I'd like to tell you about the booklet that we're offering this month.
[time=896] It's entitled Relationships and every one of us need a friend.
[time=901] We also need to know how to be a friend.
[time=903] And this is a very helpful booklet that you can read in just a little bit of time but will give you some instruction concerning being a friend and having friends.
[time=913] So write to us today for this book entitled Relationships and you can receive it by writing
[time=919] to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=937] We go back now to the live portion of our program for some more music and then the message from our associate pastor Jim Pearson, I hope that you'll stay tuned.
[time=971] [MUSIC - 230 seconds]
[time=1204] Bible with you this morning, I'd like you to turn with me to the ninth chapter of the book of Acts.
[time=1209] The ninth chapter of the book of Acts, we're going to be going through the first 22 verses of that chapter today.
[time=1216] We're not going to read them all at the beginning, we'll merely work our way through them as we go in the lesson,
[time=1222] a lesson which I've entitled, "A Holy Terror is Holy Transformed." Saul of Tarsus will be transformed by the Holy Spirit of God, the power of God, as he takes a hold of Saul of Tarsus and changes his life.
[time=1238] Let's pray and ask God to bless our service again.
[time=1241] Father, thank you so much for the power of your word.
[time=1244] Thank you through music that we can indeed turn our hearts toward Jesus.
[time=1249] Look full in his wonderful face and know the transformation that there is healing, there's comfort,
[time=1256] there's power, there's mercy.
[time=1258] I'll thank you for the message and music today.
[time=1260] Bless our time now as we study the words of Saul of Tarsus, recorded by Luke in Christ's name.
[time=1268] [AMEN] Well, I remember well as a child in the mid-1950s, our family getting a new television set.
[time=1277] TV was just in its infancy back then, the screens were a lot smaller, and of course the image was only in black and white,
[time=1284] but I remember the excitement of getting that television set.
[time=1288] And I remember coming home after school, rushing home, going in the closet, grabbing my mouse ears, and sitting down in front of the television set and watching the Mickey Mouse Club.
[time=1298] You know, as I reflected back on that this week, I realized something.
[time=1301] My first boyhood crush must have been on a net funicelo.
[time=1306] She seemed so sophisticated to me at age 11, but a net went on to bigger and better things, but I really enjoyed watching the Mickey Mouse Club.
[time=1315] There was another program which came on about that same time, it was the Howdy Duty Show.
[time=1320] And I really like that show too.
[time=1322] And you'll remember it began with Buffalo Bob Smith saying, "Hey kids, what time is it?"
[time=1328] And every child in America sitting in front of their television erupted, "It's Howdy Duty Time."
[time=1334] Well, I remember one day when I was about the age of my youngest son, Kyle, my father working hard outside and sweating in the hot summer sun.
[time=1344] He was cutting the grass and he was working hard and he must have had an appointment.
[time=1348] And he was watching his time very carefully, and I was kind of running through the house, getting ready to watch one of the shows that was on on Saturday morning.
[time=1354] And my dad came in and he said, "Jim, what time is it?" I said, "Well dad, it's Howdy Duty Time."
[time=1364] I think the sponsor of that show was Wonder Bread, and that's the way my dad came down on me that day.
[time=1369] 12 different ways as Wonder Bread.
[time=1372] Well, those shows were excellent, but the real American favorites were the situation
[time=1378] comedies that were on at that time. And there were many of them.
[time=1381] Of course, there was I love Lucy, Dennis the Menace, the Donna Reed show.
[time=1385] There was Ozzy and Harriet, which ran for about 15 years.
[time=1389] And Ozzy Nelson never went to work once in 15 years.
[time=1392] Did you ever notice that?
[time=1393] But there were a lot of things on the shows at that time.
[time=1396] Ozzy and Harriet, as I said, but one of the favorites was Father Knows Best.
[time=1401] Father Knows Best starred Robert Young as Jim Anderson, businessman, living back in the 50s.
[time=1408] This was before Robert Young went back to medical school and became Marcus Welby.
[time=1412] At this point, he was still a businessman.
[time=1414] And he was living in one of those burgeoning American suburbs in the mid to late 1950s with his wife
[time=1421] and his three kids. The three children were, of course, Betty and Bud.
[time=1427] The youngest daughter was named Kathy.
[time=1430] Jim Anderson called her kitten.
[time=1431] The girl who played Kathy in real life's name was Lauren Chapin.
[time=1436] Each day, Lauren Chapin went to the studio to film another episode of Father Knows Best.
[time=1443] She went and assumed the role of Kathy Anderson, who had about his perfect life as any young girl could have in America. She had a wonderful, beautiful home, a beautiful neighborhood with lots of friends. She had wonderful, loving parents.
[time=1457] But then at the end of each day, what Americans didn't know was that Lauren Chapin
[time=1464] went home to a real life that was much, much different than the one that she enjoyed as Kathy Anderson.
[time=1472] For Lauren Chapin's childhood was strongly affected by an alcoholic mother and an abusive father.
[time=1480] By the time Lauren Chapin was a young girl, she was already abusing drugs and alcohol.
[time=1487] And by the time Father Knows Best had had its last show in 1962, Lauren Chapin was addicted to drugs
[time=1498] and alcohol. As a young actress looking for work and no longer in demand as the cute little
[time=1504] Kathy Anderson, she had reached the age of 17. She couldn't find work and she became frustrated.
[time=1510] She got married quickly and was divorced almost as soon. She got married again a few years later
[time=1517] and once again was divorced. By the time she was 19, she was hooked on heroin and even
[time=1524] resorted to prostitution to pay for the drug habit that she had gotten into.
[time=1529] Well life went from bad to worse for Lauren Chapin, but still as a young teenager before
[time=1536] reaching age 20, it hit bottom as she was arrested in a bank trying to forge checks
[time=1542] to feed the drug habit that was eating at her soul on her body.
[time=1548] But then God began to work in young Lauren Chapin's life. God began to work in her life and he began
[time=1555] to take a hold of her and work with her. Her mother passed away and her grandmother passed away
[time=1561] very close to each other and for the first time Lauren Chapin writes in her autobiography, she began to ponder eternity. She began to ponder what would happen to her if she were to pass from this life
[time=1573] and she began to think about her life and what was happening to her. It was about that time that God
[time=1579] brought a young Christian woman into her life and that young Christian woman witnessed to her and
[time=1585] invited her to church and Chapin writes that she went to church with her friend that day hoping to
[time=1591] meet a young single man but instead Lauren Chapin met the Lord Jesus Christ. The preacher began to
[time=1599] proclaim the message. It was a message of forgiveness, a message of healing, a message of transformation
[time=1606] and when the invitation was given Lauren Chapin went forward and confessed her sins and gave her
[time=1612] heart and her life to the Lord Jesus Christ. We might say today that she became radically saved.
[time=1619] God reached down and healed her body and in the next years he transformed her life. Today she is
[time=1626] drug and alcohol free. She is married to a fine Christian man living in Texas. She has a ministry
[time=1633] to other children who were abused and also to children who abused drugs and alcohol. She serving
[time=1640] God as a radiant and vibrant Christian woman. God changes lives today. God changes lives and transforms
[time=1649] people but that same God that transformed Lauren Chapin during the 1970s and 80s has been transforming
[time=1657] lives for many hundreds and hundreds of years. There was a harlot named Rahab but God transformed her
[time=1665] life. There was a pagan named Abraham and God took a hold of him and transformed his life. There
[time=1672] was a man named Moses and God transformed his life and took him right up to the edge of the promise land leading his people. But perhaps the most famous and most important conversion that has ever
[time=1686] occurred occurred in New Testament times and it was the conversion of Saul of Tarsus. Saul of Tarsus
[time=1693] as he was turned from persecutor to preacher. Persecutor of the church to proclaimer of the gospel
[time=1700] and that's what I want us to see today. A holy terror who was holy transformed. In Acts chapter 9 we're
[time=1708] going to study the life of the Apostle Paul but at this time Saul of Tarsus and as we study that
[time=1716] I want us to look at three stages in the life of Saul of Tarsus as we trace God's transformation
[time=1723] of this man from persecutor to preacher. First of all let's look at Saul the persecutor. That's found
[time=1731] in verses 1 and 2 of Acts chapter 9. Meanwhile Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against
[time=1741] the Lord's disciples. He went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus
[time=1747] so that if he found any there who belonged to the way whether men or women he might take them as
[time=1753] prisoners to Jerusalem. Now in Acts chapters 1 through 8 we have recorded the early evangelistic
[time=1761] thrust of the church of Jesus Christ. Jesus said in Acts chapter 1 you will be my witnesses in
[time=1767] Jerusalem first and in Acts 1 through 7 we see the witness to the city of Jerusalem and by the time
[time=1775] we go to chapter 8 there will be a persecution taking place and the church will be dispersed and
[time=1781] the church will be dispersed into Judea and to Samaria and eventually to the uttermost parts of the earth. It will unfold just as Jesus said it would but it's at this point in Acts chapter 7
[time=1794] that we first run in to Saul of Tarsus. Saul the persecutor as a young man. Back in Acts chapter 7
[time=1802] you'll remember Stephen is giving a stinging rebuke to the Sanhedrin. Stephen is sharing with them
[time=1809] the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ and the Messiah and he tells them in no uncertain terms you killed
[time=1815] the Messiah you killed the anointed one the holy one oh you missed it guys you missed him and then
[time=1822] he said and I see him at the right hand of God and at that the Sanhedrin erupted and they took
[time=1828] stones in their hands to kill Stephen and it says there they took off their coats and they laid them at the feet of a young man named Saul and were introduced to Saul for the first time and it says
[time=1841] and Saul gave approval as they lifted those stones and sent Stephen out into eternity to be with his
[time=1848] Lord and then in Acts chapter 8 it says on that same day that Stephen died on that same day a great
[time=1856] persecution broke out and Saul was right at the center of it it says in those first verses of chapter 8 that Saul went from house to house dragging the Christians out of their homes and throwing them in prison he would later say in the 22nd chapter of Acts that he beat them he said that he
[time=1872] persecuted them to their death Saul of Tarsus was persecuting the church and he was breathing
[time=1878] fire and hatred from his nostrils at that time and now in verses 1 and 2 of chapter 9 Luke
[time=1886] returns to this awful spectacle Saul the persecutor persecuting the church of Jesus Christ
[time=1893] in verse 1 it says that Saul was still still after all of this time breathing out murderous threats
[time=1900] he was breathing out murderous threats the idea there is of a person seething with hatred
[time=1907] one who was just his very breath is breathing out his hatred and his contempt for those people called the way called believers called Christians it carries with it the idea of deeply agitated
[time=1920] emotion we have in verse 1 the picture of a man whose heart was filled with hatred and a man whose
[time=1927] mind was filled with prejudice Saul of Tarsus persecuting the church trying to stamp it out wipe
[time=1935] it out in Acts 26 he says that he was obsessed with persecuting and punishing the church whenever
[time=1943] he could well verse 2 is very interesting because I think something is occurring he goes to the high
[time=1951] priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues and Damascus it's obvious that as Saul of Tarsus
[time=1957] dispersed the church and as they fled out into the countryside they were sharing the gospel wherever they went and even Saul in his great persecution couldn't put a stop to it and as they shared the
[time=1968] gospel churches were popping up in other cities and now Saul of Tarsus hears of it and so he goes to
[time=1974] the Sanhedrin he says I'll stamp it out I'll stamp it out one more time I'll put it into it I'm going to end this new movement right now and he goes to the Sanhedrin and he asked for papers
[time=1985] these were search warrants arrest warrants that would allow him to go to Damascus that would allow
[time=1991] him to go there and seize the Christians and bring them back and throw them in prison not only that but
[time=1997] these official papers from the Sanhedrin ordered all of those temple workers to assist him in going about his business Saul was breathing hatred he was breathing fire toward the church he was going
[time=2010] to stamp it out but you know there's always been persecution of the church there's always been
[time=2018] persecution it began with Saul but it's continued on since then and all through history oh in America we don't feel much of it but as we read the testimonies of so many and so many other
[time=2029] countries we hear of the torture and the persecution that they've gone through oh Saul might have been
[time=2036] one of the first but he wasn't the last about 150 years later a new emperor would come to Rome his
[time=2045] name was Marcus Aurelius Marcus Aurelius hated Christians and he sought to stamp them out he was brutal
[time=2053] he tortured them he murdered them he put them through the most unthinkable torture before he would put them to death well the bishop at that time was a man named polycarp polycarp was an old man
[time=2065] he had served his lord a long time he decided to flee to try to flee for his life but as he was going
[time=2071] down the streets of Rome in a disguise a child recognized him and shouted out his name and when
[time=2078] the child did that the guards came and seized polycarp the bishop and took him before the emperor Marcus Aurelius polycarp stood before him and Aurelius said renounce Christ and I'll let you go
[time=2090] renounce Christ you must renounce him do that and I'll let you go polycarp answered no I won't
[time=2098] Marcus Aurelius in desperation said again renounce Christ and I'll release you but this is the answer
[time=2105] that he got from polycarp he said 86 years I have served him and he never once wronged me how then
[time=2113] shall I blaspheme my king who has saved me polycarp was then burned at the stake but you see polycarp
[time=2122] knew something that Saul of Tarsus was about to find out and that is that even in the midst of
[time=2128] persecution God is there and God is sovereign and God is in control God is in control
[time=2136] Saul of Tarsus was about to find out what it was like to come face to face with the risen lord
[time=2146] Jesus Christ oh perhaps today I would doubt that very many of us are feeling that much persecution
[time=2153] in our life certainly nothing like what the young Christians were going through at this time but perhaps there's a young person here and you're feeling persecution at the school that you go to hang in there God is in control perhaps there's an adult here and you're going to work each day
[time=2169] and you're feeling persecution for your faith from your co-workers hang in there God is sovereign God
[time=2175] is in control and you'll bring you through oh perhaps there's somebody here today and you've
[time=2181] received Christ and you're being persecuted for that in the home in which you live hang in there God is in control Saul of Tarsus didn't know it yet he thought he could stamp out the church
[time=2192] of Jesus Christ but he couldn't and he was about to be changed Saul the persecutor breathing out
[time=2200] hatred for the church but soon to become Saul the penitent giving his heart in his life to Jesus
[time=2208] Christ let's move on in our text and to the second point this morning and that is that Saul the penitent
[time=2214] the second stage in Saul's life that I want to look at today Saul the penitent the repentant sinner
[time=2220] and this is found in verses three through eight as he neared Damascus on his journey suddenly a light
[time=2227] from heaven flashed around him he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him Saul Saul why do you
[time=2234] persecute me who are you Lord Saul asked I am Jesus whom you are persecuting he replied now get up
[time=2242] and go into the city and you will be told what you must do well Saul was coming face to face with
[time=2250] Jesus Christ and he would never be the same again let's look at this tremendous conversion experience
[time=2256] that happened that day on the Damascus road in verse three it says as he neared Damascus later on
[time=2263] in another speech Saul would say that he got there about noon and that's important for this as he neared Damascus on his journey about noon suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him
[time=2274] a bright light from heaven flashed around him and out shown the hot Arabian desert sun the hot
[time=2281] desert sun at 12 noon at high noon when the sun would be beating down upon the sand and its intensity
[time=2287] and yet there came a light from heaven with heaven as its source that was so bright and so strong and so intense that it outshown the light of the sun that day and Saul said that it
[time=2298] drove him to his feet he fell to the ground the strong tough Saul of Tarsus fell to the ground
[time=2306] and all of those with him did also and then the words came to him Saul Saul why do you persecute me
[time=2314] let's look at those words for a few moments because there's an important teaching there notice that Jesus didn't say to him Saul Saul why did you persecute Stephen notice that he didn't say
[time=2327] Saul why are you persecuting Philip and the other believers that's not what Jesus said Jesus said
[time=2333] Saul why are you persecuting me the truth there shows us the oneness and the love of Christ for his
[time=2344] church his people and that he sees his church in himself as one intertwined together protected by his
[time=2351] love Jesus was saying to Saul when you watch them throw the rocks at Stephen I felt every blow
[time=2359] oh when you were persecuting those Christians and throwing him into the prison cells I felt
[time=2365] their loneliness I felt their suffering I felt their persecution off you're here today and you're
[time=2372] feeling that persecution know that Jesus Christ feels that pain he's with you today and he wants to
[time=2378] help you to go through that time but Saul of Tarsus comes face to face with Jesus Christ notice
[time=2385] that he said who are you Lord Saul asked I am Jesus whom you are persecuting now the question is
[time=2393] always always asked when we read these verses at what point did Saul of Tarsus get saved at what
[time=2399] point was their regeneration at what point was he born again and some have speculated as to when it
[time=2405] might have been I think it happened right here I believe that it happened right here on the Damascus road Saul of Tarsus was rabbinically trained he was trained under the great teacher Gamelio if anyone
[time=2418] would have known a divine manifestation it was Saul of Tarsus and as that light shone down and as
[time=2424] he was driven to his knees Saul of Tarsus knew that he was in the presence of a divine manifestation
[time=2430] I don't think he knew yet who it was but he knew that this was deity it was something from heaven
[time=2436] and it was overpowering him driving him to his knees when he said who are you Lord I believe
[time=2443] Saul of Tarsus was saying I know that you're from heaven and I know that you're something divine
[time=2450] but I don't know who you are but then Jesus said I am Jesus whom you are persecuting in the next
[time=2458] few verses as we will see his obedience to the Lord it's obvious that that day as he came eyeball to
[time=2465] eyeball and face to face with the risen savior Jesus Christ on the Damascus road God through his mercy
[time=2472] and his forgiveness took the hatred from Saul's heart and replaced it with love took the emptiness
[time=2480] from Saul's life and filled it with meaning and he was changed drastically taken a hold of
[time=2487] on the Damascus road that day yes Saul of Tarsus God saved right there on the Damascus road
[time=2494] in verses six through nine we can see more evidence of that Jesus said to him now get up and go into
[time=2500] the city and you will be told what you must do the men traveling with Saul stood their speechless
[time=2507] they heard the sound but they did not see anything another account says that they fell to the ground with Saul and then they stood back up Saul got up from the ground but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing they led him by the hand into Damascus they led him humbled obediently into Damascus
[time=2527] as Jesus had told him to do he was changed God had gotten a hold of his life
[time=2533] and Saul the persecutor had become Saul the penitent Saul the repentance sinner Saul had gotten
[time=2541] radically saved God had seized him he had been arrested by Christ on the Damascus road never to be
[time=2547] the same in his life will make a 180 degree turn very quickly but what's the lesson from that today
[time=2554] well it makes no difference whether you're a king or whether you're a peasant you must come face
[time=2560] to face with Jesus Christ in this life and you must repent of your sins if you want to know that you have everlasting life in a home in heaven it makes no difference whether you're a five-star general or a private you must come face to face with Jesus Christ in this life it makes no difference whether you're a world-class athlete or whether you're confined to a wheelchair you must come face to face
[time=2581] with Jesus Christ in this life Saul of Tarsus came face to face and was radically transformed as
[time=2587] we'll see in a few minutes but everyone here today has to have that experience there won't be lightning bolts like there wasn't the Damascus road and you may not you will not see a risen savior
[time=2599] but the Bible teaches that you must be born again you must come to Jesus Christ makes no difference
[time=2606] who you are you must have this experience well millions of young boys in America strap on the
[time=2614] football pads every fall and go out and hit and dream of one day playing in the national football
[time=2620] league for most it's a one and a million shot most of them will never make it and they'll grow up
[time=2626] and put the football pads aside and never make it to the NFL and to the fame and fortune that it brings but one who did dream of that as a young man and who achieved his goal now plays middle
[time=2638] land backer for the Chicago Bears his name is Mike Singletary his list of accomplishments goes on
[time=2645] and on Mike Singletary has played in over nine probals he has been named to the all-star team virtually
[time=2652] every year of his career he has been named the defensive player of the year and in the 1980s he was
[time=2658] voted the middle linebacker of the decade the best middle linebacker to play the game during the 1980s
[time=2664] you know when you have accomplishments and fame and fortune like that it's very easy to become larger
[time=2671] than life in your own mind it's very easy to become arrogant and cocky and independent to feel like
[time=2677] you don't need anybody to be like Saul of Tarsus climbing up the road toward the Sanhedrin or Mike Singletary climbing up toward the top of the national football league fame and fortune
[time=2689] and all that it could bring yet in his autobiography Singletary on Singletary Mike Singletary
[time=2696] talks about his conversion to Jesus Christ he talks about a time in his life when the sin and the pride
[time=2703] kept God away he didn't need God but he said that God stayed after him God stayed after him and
[time=2709] it got to the point where he could push God away no more Mike Singletary future hall of
[time=2717] fame or the one called the samurai warrior by his teammates for the way that he attacks ball carriers became a repentant sinner and God down on his knees and confessed to his family whom he had hurt
[time=2730] and to his God that he needed to forgiveness and needed to be transformed he says in his book that
[time=2738] God filled the void that for so long had been filled by pride and ego and sin and the world and
[time=2744] filled it with love and filled it with spiritual strength Mike Singletary is now an active member
[time=2751] of Willow Creek Community Church and South Barrington Illinois his pastor Bill Hybles has preached in our pulpit here at Black Hawk a great story but whether you're Mike Singletary of the Chicago Bears
[time=2762] or a young person at age 12 who feels they have no friends in life there must be an experience
[time=2771] like that of the Damascus Road a time when we come face to face with Jesus Christ have you done that
[time=2778] today have you done that today I pray that you have for there's forgiveness at the cross Saul found
[time=2787] that out that day but he's going to find out more in just a moment before he's going to find out that there's not just forgiveness there's transformation let's move on and let's look at our third point this morning and that is Saul the preacher Saul the preacher let's pick up the narrative at verse
[time=2803] 9 for three days he was blind and did not eat or drink anything in Damascus there was a disciple named
[time=2811] Ananias the Lord called to him in a vision Ananias yes Lord he answered the Lord told him go to the house
[time=2819] of Judas on Strait Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul for he is praying in a vision he
[time=2828] has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight it's amazing that
[time=2835] one like Saul could become like a saint but God not only saves God transforms did you notice the
[time=2843] immediate transformation in Saul of Tarsus in the narrative there for it says that when Ananias
[time=2852] would go to see him he would find him praying there's evidence of a changed life in Saul of Tarsus
[time=2860] already that soon after his conversion that soon after his conversion what changes do we see first
[time=2867] of all in Saul of Tarsus we see a new reverence for God a new reverence for God notice that it says
[time=2875] that he had been praying for three days he had been without food for three days without water for three days now I want to point out that Saul of Tarsus had prayed before he had been to the temple and
[time=2886] he had prayed Saul of Tarsus had fasted before but there was something new something different
[time=2893] and I believe that he went without food and water so that he could devote all of his time to prayer and to communion with God there was a new reverence for God a new relationship
[time=2905] that he didn't have before and now it was different have you ever wondered what Saul was praying about
[time=2912] there I have a strong feeling that he was praying for wisdom a strong feeling that he was praying for
[time=2918] guidance and direction and for forgiveness I believe that he was thinking back on what he had done
[time=2924] to the church and all the trouble that he had caused but now he has a new relationship believe
[time=2931] as I read this I ask myself the question do I have the reverence for God now in my life 17 years
[time=2938] after my conversion that I had for him when I first came to him do I have that same reverence
[time=2944] that Saul of Tarsus had that nothing was more important than that communion that fresh relationship
[time=2951] I pray that I do and I pray that you do also but Saul was changed he had a new reverence for God
[time=2959] as we move on in the narrative we'll see that he had a new relationship to the church notice as he goes on Lord verse 13 Lord Ananias answered I have heard many reports about this man
[time=2971] and all the harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem and he has come here with authority from the chief priest to arrest all who call on your name Ananias didn't want to go he was scared
[time=2983] to death of Saul of Tarsus but God said go this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before
[time=2992] the Gentiles and their canes and before the people of Israel I will show him how much he must suffer
[time=2999] for my name notice verse 17 then Ananias went to the house and entered it placing his hands on
[time=3006] Saul he said brother Saul brother Saul or he could also be rendered Saul my brother there was a new
[time=3017] relationship to God's people a new relationship to the church and Ananias goes in and he sees Saul
[time=3025] and because of what God has shown him there's a love for Saul and he says affectionately brother Saul and he places his hands on him that Saul might receive the Holy Spirit a few verses later we will
[time=3038] see Saul and in verse 19 as we go on it says that he will get up and was baptized and took food
[time=3045] and then in verse 19 it says he spent several days with the disciples in Damascus this is the
[time=3052] same Saul of Tarsus that a few days before wouldn't even go near the Christians without trying to
[time=3058] kill them the hatred spewed from his being but here just a short time later he is in the city spending
[time=3065] time with them loving them fellow shipping with them and Ananias says Saul my brother and I'm
[time=3073] sure that Saul said Ananias my brother Saul loved the brethren that's an evidence of the changed
[time=3081] life the person who truly believes loves the brethren he loves his brothers and sisters in Christ
[time=3088] how do you love the brethren today I pray that you do perhaps there's something between you and
[time=3095] one of your brothers and sisters in the house of God today what a great time from the example of Saul to settle that issue once and for all love the brethren all letting nothing come in between but a second feature a new relationship to the church and then thirdly notice in verses 20 and
[time=3113] 21 he began to bear witness to his lord he spent several days with the disciples in Damascus and at
[time=3120] once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the son of God he preached that Jesus was
[time=3127] the son of God and all those who were heard and were astonished isn't this the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem is this the same man he so changed we can't believe it but Saul was bearing
[time=3138] witness and I believe that Saul was going around he was saying let me tell you about Jesus Christ I've met the risen Lord let me tell you about his love let me tell you how it can change you he changed me Saul was a new man and a third evidence was that he began to bear witness a true believer
[time=3156] wants to tell others wants to tell others about his faith in Jesus Christ true believer wants to
[time=3164] share that gospel with all that he can oh Saul was transformed by the power of God now these
[time=3172] signs were immediate in a few moments we'll look at some and we'll talk about transformation that
[time=3178] occurs progressively throughout our experience with Christ but this transformation was immediate I remember just a couple of years ago my youngest son Kyle he was about four at the time
[time=3191] and he was bothering his mother one day and he was bugging and bugging and bugging and bugging and he was asking for things and she met all of his needs and was very paced with him and finally the first time she said no he looked at her and he said I hate you I don't don't know where he
[time=3208] heard that or how that came out of his being I don't even know that he knew what the word meant but I remember his mother got very indignant and looked him in the eye and pointed her finger in his face and said Kyle I know that you don't know what you just said but I want you to know that that hurts people and I better never ever hear that word again or you'll be punished well a few hours
[time=3231] went on and he began to bug for some things again and finally at one point his mother said no again
[time=3237] and as he turned and went off down the hallway in a muffled tone he said I hate you
[time=3244] my wife Linda got a look on her face and she went off down the hall without saying a word she walked right into the bedroom where he was I'm going to tell you he was about to be radically transformed my wife walked in with a look on her face he looked at his mother and he was in trouble
[time=3261] and said I didn't say I hate you he was punished that day and to my knowledge I haven't heard him say
[time=3269] that word since there was an immediate radical transformation that took place oh we can't compare
[time=3276] that to the transformation that Saul of Tarsus had that day on the Damascus Road oh but it illustrates the point that we can be immediately changed and Saul was changed but notice in verse 17 in verse
[time=3288] 17 it says that when he prayed for him he was filled with the Holy Spirit and their Saul of Tarsus
[time=3296] received the power to live the Christian life through his obedience and through his dedication and
[time=3303] his yielding to the power of God in his life the Holy Spirit would fill him in chapter 9 in chapter
[time=3310] 13 it says he again was filled with the Spirit and then in chapter 14 it says it again he was filled
[time=3317] with the Spirit as Paul walked obediently in the power of God and walked and yielded his life
[time=3323] to God the Holy Spirit of God filled him with the power to walk the Christian life and that power
[time=3330] that's found in the Holy Spirit is the power that transforms yes our transformation can be immediate
[time=3338] our transformation can be quickly but there is also something in our Christian life called sanctification
[time=3345] which is progressive as the Holy Spirit works in us and as Peter says in second Peter chapter 1
[time=3352] as we strive to add to our faith goodness and wisdom and all of those traits as we strive the
[time=3360] Holy Spirit strives with us and builds us and transforms us yes we can be saved we can be transformed
[time=3369] we can be transformed Saul of Tarsus the persecutor Saul of Tarsus the penitent Saul of Tarsus
