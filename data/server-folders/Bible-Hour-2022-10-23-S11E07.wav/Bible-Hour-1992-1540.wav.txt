[time=0] Well we come again to the study of 1 Timothy chapter 3 and qualifications for elders and we are reminded that Paul is
[time=9] qualifying the highest office of leadership in the church and he does it by men's relational maturity. It's how strong they are in the relationships of their life.
[time=20] He starts with the wife, he then moves to the household and to a man and his children. He then covers the broad range of a man's reputation with those outside the church.
[time=31] And again it affirms to us that the best definition of spiritual maturity is found in our relationships. We are only as spiritual as our worst relationship.
[time=50] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=64] Today Pastor Moore will be presenting the second in a series of messages on church leadership from 1 Timothy chapter 3.
[time=72] When the world looks for a leader, it often looks for how successful an individual has been. What has he accomplished? The Bible says that we should select church leaders on the basis of their character and their relationships.
[time=85] How does a man relate to his wife, to his family and to those outside the church? It is a sobering thought to realize that we are only as spiritual as our worst relationship.
[time=96] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to 1 Timothy chapter 3 so that you will be prepared to study along with us.
[time=105] Our special music today will include a song from the men's singers entitled "Jesus is My Music."
[time=112] And just before the message, our Handel Choir will play a number entitled "Two Meditations on the Cross."
[time=119] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's begin our time of worship as the sanctuary choir presents "Sing Me a Song about Jesus."
[time=149] "Sing Me a Song about Jesus." "Like the sing in the great fire of all."
[time=161] "But can we say about Jesus?"
[time=167] "And the marvelous things he has done."
[time=174] "The words that is right in the kingdom."
[time=181] "Sing Me a Song about Jesus."
[time=278] "Like the sing in the great fire of all."
[time=308] "Sing Me a Song about Jesus."
[time=338] "My life was out of tune and happiness eluded me."
[time=348] "My life was just noise and lacking in her harmony."
[time=354] "But then I met the Savior and saw His matchless face and now my heart sings melody."
[time=369] "Jesus is my music. Jesus is my song. Jesus is my music. I want to sing His praises all day long."
[time=421] "I played with earthly toys and emptiness frustrated me. My life was just a noise and lacking sensitivity. But then I met the Savior and received His gift of grace and now my life's a symphony."
[time=450] "Jesus is my music. Jesus is my song. Jesus is my music. I want to sing His praises all day long."
[time=497] "I want to sing His praises all day long."
[time=519] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. I hope that you've already been inspired by the music from our sanctuary choir and the men singers.
[time=527] I'm always happy to minister to you in this way and I know that music plays a vital part in the inspiration in people's lives.
[time=534] And Russell, we're into the second message of your series on church leadership today.
[time=539] Well, it's an exciting study for me. I know because it forces me to evaluate my own life and I find that I fall short in so many different areas and continue to want to strive after the things that God would have for me.
[time=552] And at the same time as I look back over my life and the time that I've been saved these last 12 years I can see real growth as I measured against that standard. So it's a little bit of a sweet and sour pork kind of a thing where you're thankful for all the growth that is there and thankful for the things that God has been doing in your life at the same time feeling very challenged.
[time=570] A lot of responsibility on church leadership whether you're actually employed so to speak by a church or whether you're in a voluntary capacity. A lot of our lay people have a great deal of responsibility in leadership roles.
[time=583] Well, last week we talked about having a special guest on our program today. Steve Longbreak is the administrator of our school. Steve, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=594] Good morning, Peter. Thanks for having me. You know, I was reminded of a quotation when we talk about the Christian school that said as the twig is bent so the tree is inclined. What is the purpose of Black Hawk Christian school? Why is it different than maybe some of the other schools in the area?
[time=609] You know, we have a real purpose in trying to bend that twig toward the Lord Jesus and God the Father and the Holy Spirit.
[time=617] And we have a desire that everything that we do will move them toward a relationship with him that will be fulfilling to them and also an encouragement to the rest of the world as they are able to share the truth about the Lord with other folks along with good quality academic instruction.
[time=635] Well, I know that I've experienced through my own children a great reward of having them in our Christian school. Russell, you've just begun with your children enrolled for the first time this fall in the school and I know that you have great things to look forward to.
[time=650] Well, I'm so thankful for the school. The spiritual atmosphere is unparalleled. I mean, it's the kids love the Lord and the teachers love the Lord and it's a strong, vibrant environment.
[time=660] But what I'm amazed at is the academics. My daughter, Randy, she's in the fifth grade and she is working harder on her academics and reading more and is challenged in very positive ways academically than I've ever seen her before.
[time=674] She loves it, but I've never seen her work so hard and then she's got her flute practice because she's in the band and then she's on some of the sports teams and you just, I don't know how you beat it.
[time=683] Well, I know by just some of the footies that we showed of activities at the school. There's a lot of excitement there and Steve, our buildings are pretty full and we are talking about expansion coming up in just a few weeks.
[time=695] I know you've been working very hard at the building committee and the architect to expand the physical facilities that we have for Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=703] Yes, you know, we've graduated 10 classes now. We have a K through 12 program, but we've just been able to double track kindergarten through fourth grade in the last five years.
[time=714] And we're really thrilled that we're moving toward occupying a new building because the one across the street is two-fold. We have way too many people in there and not enough rooms.
[time=724] So we have some pictures I'd like to take a minute and just introduce our audience to the exterior of our new building. This comes on on the east side of our new worship center.
[time=734] And as you're looking at it right now, you'll look at the main entrance to the educational portion of Black Hawk Baptist Church and Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=743] The gymnasium is on the left and some classrooms. How will this building as we look at more of the site plan affect the school?
[time=751] You know, as you look at that site plan, it fits in so beautifully to this piece of property over here.
[time=756] It's like the Lord said, well, folks, you don't know what's coming, but I'll give you this beautiful site where a floodplain for a soccer and baseball diamond where you can't build buildings and make the building fit just right. It's a beautiful place.
[time=768] It's going to make it possible for us to have 10 more classrooms and a gymnasium that'll seat about 1200 people, something we really desperately need.
[time=776] And a good science lab that we're building into this building that's really going to be fully equipped for our kids to prepare them for college and then later science pursuits.
[time=785] And the building is going to meet our needs tremendously. I'm really thankful for it.
[time=789] Now, not only does that help Black Hawk Christian school, but Russ, it sure helps our church family as well.
[time=795] Well, the Sunday morning, we call them ABF's adult Bible Fellowships. We have about 20 of those.
[time=801] We break our large church of 17, 1800 people down to groups of 50 or 60. So we can have the ongoing shepherding and the personal touch.
[time=810] And we're a fall. We don't have any space for those to continue to grow and we need additional sunny school classes for the adults and we'll bring them all together in this new building. And I think it's going to be exciting.
[time=822] Well, it won't be long that we'll be announcing to you groundbreaking and Steve, we're heavily into registration for next fall. How can people that are interested in enrolling their children or grandchildren in Black Hawk Christian school find out more information?
[time=835] We have many classes with waiting lists. And that's been a problem. We hate to turn students down, but in kindergarten through fourth grade for sure. And in a few of the other classes too, there are a few openings.
[time=845] But kindergarten through fourth grade, we'll have openings for next year. Beginning March 9th, we'll open that registration up. You can write to us at 7400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, or call us at 493-7400.
[time=860] We'll be glad to answer your questions and send anything home that you might need in order to register your child.
[time=866] Well, Steve, we want to thank you for your leadership of Black Hawk Christian school. We're really excited about the growth and all of the teachers and administration that are involved in that great ministry of ours.
[time=878] Now, just before we go back to the live portion of our program, this will be the last time that we'll offer the pamphlet entitled relationships.
[time=885] This is a pamphlet that will help you work with other people that are in need and encourage them. I'd like to have you write for it today. You can receive it absolutely free if you'll write to the Bible Hour.
[time=896] 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour. 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=911] I hope that you'll stay tuned for more music and that the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=941] 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1152] (Applause)
[time=1158] Well, thank you very much, ladies, and what a tremendous illustration of the harmony that should characterize a family or the Church of God as everybody has their own part, and when they do it just right, makes a beautiful music.
[time=1177] And when they don't do it just right, chaos.
[time=1182] If you have your Bible with you this morning, I'd like you to take it and turn to 1 Timothy, chapter 3,
[time=1189] we're in the middle of a study of this book, and particularly of a passage in 1 Timothy 3, verses 1 through 7,
[time=1196] describing and listing the qualifications of Church leadership.
[time=1201] Allow me to read it and you can follow along.
[time=1204] 1 Timothy, chapter 3, verse 1, "It is a trustworthy statement.
[time=1210] If any man aspires to the office of overseer, it is a fine work he desires to do.
[time=1216] And overseer then must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
[time=1225] not addicted to wine or pugnacious, but gentle, and contentious, and free from the love of money.
[time=1231] He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=1237] But if a man does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of the Church of God?
[time=1242] And not a new convert, lest he become conceded and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
[time=1249] And he must have a good reputation with those outside the Church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=1257] This is a tremendous passage of scripture as it qualifies or lists the qualifications for Church leadership.
[time=1263] And you remember that Paul is calling Timothy to fight, chapter 1, verse 18.
[time=1268] He has left him there at Ephesus in order to instruct certain men not to teach strange doctrine, and Timothy is unwilling to do that.
[time=1276] He is unwilling to engage the enemy.
[time=1278] And so Paul has taken time to write this letter, and in this letter not only stimulate Timothy to his responsibility, but also give him a written form of apostolic authority by which he can approach the situation.
[time=1290] And it's difficult. It's very difficult.
[time=1293] These men have come up through the Church. Many of them, they had made professions of faith right there in the Church of Ephesus.
[time=1299] They were good friends with other people in the Church of Ephesus.
[time=1302] They had relationships and networks of relationships that had gone on, but their teaching had become errant.
[time=1307] They had begun to espouse strange doctrines.
[time=1310] In addition to those men who had come up through the ranks, there were others who had come from the outside and infiltrated the Church and had a level of charisma or a level of ability with their ability to articulate truth or alleged truth that they took on positions of leadership.
[time=1325] And now they're well entrenched, and they need to be dealt with, and it's difficult, and it's trying, because there is no betraying thing about their appearance or about their dialect or some accent that would obviously point them out as being heretics or false prophets.
[time=1340] There's no diploma on their wall that comes from a seminary of a liberal nature.
[time=1345] There is nothing overt about them that would indicate that they are false prophets or false teachers.
[time=1352] And Paul develops kind of a three-pronged approach in dealing with this very serious situation.
[time=1360] The first, as you remember, he writes in chapter 1 a description of their false doctrine.
[time=1366] He calls it strange doctrines. He says they get it by paying attention to myths and endless genealogies, and he describes the fruit of their teaching as speculation.
[time=1377] It really produces nothing, and he goes on to describe that in some detail. So the first step in dealing with these leaders who are not supposed to be in church leadership is by openly exposing the heir of their doctrine.
[time=1390] The second thing is our passage. It's a description of the character and the quality of their life, and we found even last week in our study of the Bible that you can't separate your doctrine and the impurity of your doctrine with the impurity of your life.
[time=1405] If you are not teaching true doctrine, your life will eventually show its corrupting influence in your life.
[time=1411] And so Paul lifts up in chapter 3 verses 1 through 7, a standard of true godliness, a standard of true righteousness, a standard that should characterize men who are to lead the church.
[time=1422] And that will be a very telling reality as it is exposing not their teaching but their character and the quality of their life.
[time=1430] And when men have found to have wrong doctrine, and when men have been found to be wanting and errant in their lifestyle, then come with me to chapter 5 for a minute, and you'll see the third part of Paul's approach which is really bold.
[time=1443] This is amazing, and many of us I think would shrink back from it or it required in our own assembly.
[time=1449] We'd somehow think we're judging someone or we're being legalistic or we're being too harsh, but look at verses 19 and 20.
[time=1456] Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses. This is a protection really against men and leadership being falsely accused.
[time=1465] It's okay to accuse them if there's something in their life that is worthy of it, but it must be done on the basis of two or three witnesses, but now look at verse 20.
[time=1473] Those who continue in sin, in other words they've been rebuked, they've been called back to holiness, but they won't respond. They continue in sin, then rebuked in the presence of all so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning.
[time=1488] In other words, when a man in leadership is found to have improper impure doctrine and an improper impure life, and he has been called back to obedience, but he won't repent, he continues on, then his name and his ministry and his teaching is to be declared and rebuked in the presence of the entire assembly.
[time=1507] Public disclaimer, public discipline of this man and his ministry. That's harsh, especially in light of the fact that Timothy was probably younger than many of the men he is going to have to confront.
[time=1520] These men described in Acts 20 as savage wolves.
[time=1525] So it's a serious issue, it's a difficult issue, but you've got to admit it's a relevant issue for the church of our day. The church of America is polluted with ungodly leadership, with men who do not teach the truth and men who do not live the truth.
[time=1542] And it has obviously become an object of public interest as these men and their shenanigans and all of their sin and all of their errant doctrine gets blasted all over national television, and they really are the tip of the iceberg. They are the famous ones.
[time=1557] They are the ones that catch national interest because of the scope of their ministry, but there are men just like them all over the United States of America who are not as famous or notorious.
[time=1568] And therefore don't catch the big news, but who are as errant in their teaching and as errant in their lifestyle.
[time=1575] And so as we study this passage, we call ourselves and the church back to a stared of righteousness and holiness and purity in doctrine and in living through examining this passage.
[time=1589] You remember we began last week by understanding two things that Paul gives us about church leadership in verse 1, the identity of church leadership. They are called overseers.
[time=1599] Other terms are used in the New Testament to label them. They could be called a overseer or an elder or a pastor. Those are just different names for the same group of men who give godly leadership to the church.
[time=1612] Then we looked at the aspiration of leadership and it was described in two very strong words in verse 1. It is a trustworthy statement. If any man aspires to the office of overseer, the word aspire means to reach out, to extend oneself, to take a hold of, to reach out and grab. It's in the middle voice and bring it back to yourself.
[time=1631] If any man reaches out for the office of overseer, he says, it is a fine work he desires to do. And this word epithumia, very, very strong word for the passion in a man's heart. It's in other contexts defined as lust, lust of the flesh, lust after sensual pleasure. It's that strong word in the New Testament that describes an ordinate desire and passion.
[time=1655] It is properly directed at the office and the work of the overseer. So these are men who have thought deeply about the word of god, about the temperleness of life, about the eternity of the soul, about the importance of bringing people to Christ and bringing them up into salvation and growing them in Christ and having a godly church, such as this one.
[time=1676] These are men who have identified with those values and those realities and now because of that, they want desperately to be a part of advancing the kingdom of god through the New Testament church.
[time=1687] And so he affirms that aspiration because it is an aspiration not to prestige and power as sometimes it can be misunderstood, but you remember in the early church, people who were aspiring to this kind of leadership.
[time=1701] They were signing up to be the leaders of a rebel group with no real power or significance in the world's eyes. Shortly after this book was written, Nero took charge and had all kinds of horrible persecutions of the church and the leadership of the church would have been to take the first blows of that many times being put to death.
[time=1721] They're not men who are aspiring to prestige and power. These are men who are aspiring to service because they love god and they love people and they want to give their life in helping them to understand the way of Christ.
[time=1735] Now I want you to notice before we dive in that these character qualities or this list really qualifies people for leadership not on the basis of giftedness.
[time=1746] This is not the super gifted that get to lead the church. This is not the super good looking, the super charismatic, the super good teachers, the super bright or the super wealthy who give lots of money.
[time=1756] This really has nothing to do with any kind of giftedness with respect to spiritual gifts or natural gifts.
[time=1762] What he's saying here is that men are qualified to lead the church based on the character and the quality of their life, not by some giftedness that might have been given to them.
[time=1771] This is earned. Leadership in the church is earned by hard work and faithful attending to the soul and to the mind and to the spirit and this giving that is sacrificially noted as spiritual leadership.
[time=1786] So the first phrase that I want you to see in verse two is this and overseer then must you see it there must be above reproach, must be above reproach.
[time=1798] Literally translated it means that you can't take hold of it. There's nothing there to get a hold of. There's nothing there to get your hands on.
[time=1805] When you're talking about a leader in the church, there is nothing in his life that is substantial enough to grab a hold of and say see he's disqualified. Look, I have it right here.
[time=1818] This above reproach is an umbrella phrase for the remaining five verses all the way down to verse seven. It's almost like it over arches these qualifications that follow underneath it.
[time=1829] The umbrella phrase is he must be above reproach. There's nothing in his life you can take a hold of. But the question then arises, well, can you give us some help? I mean under what categories and there are basically three categories listed.
[time=1842] The first, verse two, he is a husband of one wife. That is the very first category in which he in which he must be above reproach.
[time=1852] The second is found in verse four. He must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=1862] The second basic category in which this man must be above reproach is his household, his family, the way he has raised his family to love God.
[time=1871] The last is found in verse seven, this third category, he must have a good reputation with those outside the church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=1882] So when you're qualifying men for leadership in the church, the overarching emphasis is that they are above reproach. There is nothing significant that can be taken a hold of in their life.
[time=1892] Specifically though, you look for that in their relationship with their wife, their relationship with their family, their relationship they have with the unbelieving unredeemed community in which they live.
[time=1904] Daniel was that type of man, Daniel six. The commissioners and the satirats begin trying to find a ground of accusation against Daniel in regard to government affairs.
[time=1914] But they could find no ground of accusation or evidence of corruption in as much as he was faithful and no negligence or corruption was to be found in him.
[time=1923] Now these were searches were conducted by men of great power in the government that Daniel served. They were very jealous of his position. They wanted to find grounds to take a hold of and remove him from office.
[time=1934] They would have had access to his private records as a statesman which was the role he played there. They would have reviewed everything in great detail and when they had done that they found nothing. He was above reproach. That's the idea.
[time=1946] Job was a man above reproach. You remember it says in Job one one. There was a man in the land of us whose name was Job and that man was blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.
[time=1959] In every category Job was a godly righteous man. Were these men perfect? No. Were they senseless? No. Did they make mistakes? Yes.
[time=1968] But was there significant stuff in their life that people could take a hold of it and bring it there as a disqualifying factor? No. They were above reproach and that is what the elder and the pastor and the overseer of the New Testament church is to be like.
[time=1983] It's interesting to note that these men are also not qualified. Not only is it not giftedness but listen to two others that might sound really natural to qualify leadership in the church.
[time=1996] One, the knowledge of the Word of God. Knowledge of the Word of God. It does say that they are able to teach and that implies the knowledge of the Word of God but that is only one of many qualifications.
[time=2008] It's not that this man is a profound thinker in the Word of God and that he can rattle off all kinds of doctrinal positions and that he can rattle off all kinds of verses.
[time=2019] That's not what qualifies him. It's implied and there needs to be a strong commitment to doctrine to be an elder because they defend the flock against false doctrine.
[time=2027] But that's not the qualifying factor primarily. It is the character of his life. It's also not some ministry skill. It's not that he can stand up and talk in front of people.
[time=2039] It's not that he can lead people to Christ or head up an EE team or that he can lead a Friday night Bible study or that he can lead some other kind of ministry endeavor.
[time=2048] It's not a ministry skill. So it's not primarily knowledge of the Word of God. It's not primarily a ministry skill. It is instead the character of the man's life.
[time=2056] More is said in the New Testament about qualifications for elder than job description for elder. There is very little to be said or found in the New Testament about what the elder is supposed to do.
[time=2068] And we'll get there with time and I'll show you those passages but the vast majority of what is said about the elder in the New Testament is qualifying him for leadership.
[time=2078] It's almost as if to say when you have a man who is godly when you have a man who has met these qualifications he can do pretty much anything he wants to do because whatever it is he's going to find his way into significant ministry.
[time=2090] That's just part of who he is that'll flow out of his life and he doesn't really need a job description abroad in general when yes but nothing in specific.
[time=2098] Put godly men in charge put godly men in leadership and let them just express their ministry as god leads them and you'll have a healthy church.
[time=2108] Verse two then and overseer must be above reproach.
[time=2115] Now I want to bring to light a principle here that I think is very important for us to understand whether we're pursuing church leadership or not.
[time=2125] Whether you're ever interested in being a leader or whether you're a lady and would never be considered to be an elder as these are men in view here.
[time=2133] And that is this. These qualifications of being above reproach fall into three relational categories, relationship with wife, relationship with family, relationship with the unsaved.
[time=2147] This is the highest office in the church. Therefore this is the paragon of spiritual maturity.
[time=2156] If you want to evaluate the maturity of your life, if you come to a new year and make a new year's resolution and say well I really want to grow as a Christian this year.
[time=2166] Sometimes the attempt then is made to start all kinds of new Bible study techniques and get all kinds of tools and get on a new schedule and adjust when you go to bed and when you wake up and how many hours you're going to be in the word and how many hours you're going to be in prayer and how many ministry things you're going to get evolved in.
[time=2180] And you think therefore that by doing that stuff, that makes me mature. That's the definition of real spiritual maturity in the church. It's just not here. It's just not found in this text.
[time=2193] Spiritual maturity, not just for godly leadership, but for everybody in the church is declared as being men and women who are profoundly godly in their relationships.
[time=2207] Turn back a couple pages to 1 Timothy chapter 1, if you would. Look at verse 5. He is contrasting godly people with ungodly people.
[time=2217] And he says the goal, the goal of our instruction is what? The goal of our instruction is love.
[time=2225] Everything that we're teaching, everything that we're preaching, everything that we're doing is to produce people who love God and who love each other.
[time=2233] Jesus said in Matthew 22, I'll read it to you. They came to him saying teacher, which is the great commandment in the law. He said to them, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind.
[time=2244] That's the first great commandment. The second is like it. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. And then he said this. On these two commands depend the whole law and the prophet.
[time=2255] Perfectly consistent with what Paul says in 1 Timothy 1 5. All of doctrine, all of teaching, all of instruction, all of preaching, all of growth in the Christian life culminates in the goal of loving gracious compassion itself sacrificial people.
[time=2275] As exemplified in the leadership of the church who are above reproach in the way they love their wife, the way they love their kids, and the way they love and treat the unredeemed community around them. There's just no getting around it.
[time=2288] One of the most gifted churches that ever was spoken of in the New Testament was the church at Corinth. They had been given extraordinary spiritual gifts, but they are rebuked.
[time=2299] If I speak with the tongues of men, they were so gifted, it sounded as if they were speaking with the tongues of men and of angels. But I don't have love. I'm a noisy gong or a clanging symbol.
[time=2312] And if I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have all faith so as to remove mountains, it's a lot of faith.
[time=2320] But I do not have love. I am not relationally mature. I am nothing. If I give all my possessions to feed the poor, if I deliver my body to be burned, but I do not have love, it profits me nothing.
[time=2336] So again, I stress with you both as you evaluate your leaders and as you evaluate your own spiritual maturity and growth, it comes down to this phrase which I have said to you before, you are only as spiritual as your worst relationship.
[time=2353] That's tough medicine. That's a tough grid. That's the grid that Paul is giving for eldership in the church. You are only as spiritual, you are only as godly, you are only as spiritual immature as the worst relationship in your life.
[time=2366] That means you have to look over the landscape of all the relationships in your life, find the worst relationship and say, there it is, that's how mature I am. That's my godliness.
[time=2378] He doesn't allow you to evaluate your godliness on how much time you spend on the word of God, how many verses you may know, how many ministries you may have been a part of.
[time=2388] He puts the rubber to the road and says, because the goal of all of our instruction is love, because of all the law, as Jesus said, is kept in loving God and loving your neighbor as yourself, the true test of your godliness and maturity is found in the quality of your relationships, so measure it by the worst one.
[time=2407] That means some of us have some work to do. That means some of us have some things to put back together. That means there are some phone calls that need to be made.
[time=2414] That means there are some apologies that need to be made. That means there is some reconstructive work that needs to go on within the relationship with life and husband and family and unbeliever and people at work and relationships in days gone by.
[time=2429] Because that is where people will lay hold right there in those areas and they will say no, disqualify.
[time=2441] Now mind you, these are not perfect men as Moses wasn't, as Daniel wasn't. These are not sinless people.
[time=2451] These are people in leadership now who are moving in that direction. They are distinguishing themselves by virtue of their love for God and love for people and they are lifted up as elders.
[time=2462] And a checklist is given and you'll see it here. It begins in verse 2, the husband of one wife.
[time=2468] The husband of one wife. Now there are a couple of ways to interpret this passage or this particular phrase, the husband of one wife.
[time=2477] And typically it has been understood to describe marital status, husband of one wife. Namely that a man isn't involved in polygamy, he doesn't have two wives.
[time=2487] Sometimes it's been used by commentators to say that he's never been remarried. He's only got one wife, i.e. he's only always had one wife. He's never been remarried.
[time=2498] Others have suggested that it means he's never been divorced. He still has the wife he was married to from the beginning, so he's never been divorced.
[time=2506] Others will want to make the phrase say that he is not single. He has a wife, he is married. And so various folks oppose the passage and suggest that it involves or describes this phrase, husband of one wife, married status or marital status.
[time=2522] And I personally don't agree with that. I don't think that makes any sense. And let me tell you why.
[time=2528] Is it possible to be married to one wife and be having an affair with another woman?
[time=2535] Yes. Is it possible to be married to one wife and be lusting as Jesus said in Matthew 5 after all kinds of different women and committing adultery with them already in their hearts?
[time=2549] In other words, if the phrase only means marital status, then a person could qualify inside this phrase, "I only have one wife, I've always only had one wife, I've never been divorced, I've never been remarried, I've got one wife, I'm qualified."
[time=2564] And at that very moment, be involved in an adulterous affair or an affair in the heart with various women struggling with lust, so it really isn't a qualification.
[time=2572] Because it's an external qualification and the New Testament resists external qualification, it always goes for the heart.
[time=2580] Well you say, well then how do you propose to interpret the phrase? Well, the word husband doesn't have to be translated, husband it could be translated man.
[time=2589] And the word wife doesn't have to be translated, wife it could be translated woman, making it this, a one woman man.
[time=2600] Qualifying for leadership is the quality, the character quality, the internal reality of being a one woman man.
[time=2609] Namely, if I am married, I am completely devoted to that woman. She is the one I love, she is the one I think about, she is the one I am committed to serving, she is the one that I adore, I am moving the energy of my heart and life in her direction, I am a one woman man.
[time=2625] That's a qualification for eldership. If I happen to be single and I have never been married as was the Apostle Paul who is called an elder in the New Testament, therefore it can't be the fact that you have got to be married to be an elder.
[time=2636] But if I am single, I am not a ladies man, I am not letting my heart and my mind drift into unhealthy thoughts with women that happen to walk by or that I know and I am known as flirtatious and flighty and I am involved in all kinds of different relationships and I am disappointing women and I am leading them on.
[time=2654] All that kind of stuff that goes on in a single man's life when he is not a one woman man. In other words, he is not under control, he is not waiting for God to bring that one woman and in the interim, not disgracing himself and other people in behavior that is unbecoming of church leadership.
[time=2670] I don't think it has anything to do with marital status at all because that is in the qualification for leadership. I think it has everything to do with the heart and the energy of a man being utterly and completely devoted to the woman that is his wife, that qualifies, that is an internal reality and I will follow a man like that.
[time=2692] I will follow a man who is devoted to his wife because if he has got what it takes to love and genuinely moved towards her in self sacrificial service then he has got what it takes to take care of me and my spiritual needs and I will follow.
[time=2704] I have no interest in following a man who happens to only have one wife on the books with the state of Indiana but has had or has several adulterous affairs or has a wandering eye and is involved in all kinds of lusting after other women.
[time=2720] No interest in it at all. And overseer then must be above reproach. You cannot lay hold on his life with the way he treats his wife, the way he loves her, the way he pursues her, the way he is committed to her.
[time=2735] And if he happens to be single, there is nothing in his relationships with members of the opposite sex which would reveal that he is not under control, that he is not concerned about their best interest and promoting godliness in their life.
[time=2749] Okay, well a couple other phrases just this morning, temperate, prudent, respectable and hospitable. And I will try to give you a definition or another word for each one of these to help us think it through.
[time=2764] Temperate and the word I will give you for temperate is balanced, balanced.
[time=2770] The word temperate literally translated from the Greek would be without wine, temperate means without wine and therefore implied sobriety, the opposite of intoxication.
[time=2782] Men who are pursuing leadership and who are qualified to do so are sober-minded, they are balanced.
[time=2790] Figuratively speaking as it is in this text it means clear-headed, spiritually sober, spiritually clear-headed, not getting carried away with or under the influence of some distracting element.
[time=2802] In other words the spirit of god is what controls this man's life and because of that he has a level of balancing in the way he conducts his life.
[time=2810] He has struggled with this just last week, my temperateness because we have been in the process of buying a home and you have gone through that experience, it is very distracting.
[time=2821] Sometimes it is negatively distracting and in other ways it is just fun distracting. In other words word about all the financial ramifications and qualifying for loans and see if we have enough money to pay our monthly payments after everything gets done, everything settles out and you are worried about all that stuff and making phone calls and not want it overextend yourself and not do something that would be good.
[time=2839] And not do something that would really jeopardize your financial ability to meet the obligations you are making.
[time=2845] And so you are distracted because of all that stuff, you are distracted because you don't know if these people are going to accept your offer and how all that is going to work out.
[time=2851] I found myself distracted because I was so excited about the house that seemed like a great opportunity for my wife and the kids and do a little fix up here and fix up there.
[time=2859] There are times I just couldn't fall asleep and I am saying to myself now some of this has got to be normal but you can't let this get out of control or you lose your balance.
[time=2868] And I come to the office the next day and have trouble sitting down in front of the thing I love most which is the word of God and my mind is running over there and worried about that stuff.
[time=2876] I am saying come on, bring it in, bring it in, this is a sign of your immaturity. That is the idea.
[time=2883] A man who is temperate is able to handle some of those big issues in his life and it is not that he doesn't worry about him and he denies him as if they are not there.
[time=2892] But there is a level of maturity to be able to handle it, trust in God, think clearly about it and continue to pursue the course of his life.
[time=2901] Those are the kind of men we need leading our church. Men who are temperate or balanced.
[time=2908] The next one is prudent, prudent and I think the NIV translate it very well, self-control. That is probably the best translation that I could find.
[time=2918] It needs a little help though even as it is. Self-control but there is a feeling in this word of the mind. It is a self-control of the mind, it is an ability to control the thought processes.
[time=2929] Which as you would imagine is necessary to be balanced. In other words to stay balanced in life you have to be able to control your mind and not let it get thinking about too many things and get too excited and bring it back and stay on track.
[time=2942] It describes a man who has the truth of the word of God in his mind and it is dictating his actions.
[time=2951] His mind is controlling the way his self works. He knows the truth and he knows how to flesh that truth out in his life.
[time=2959] As I was trying to think of a way to illustrate this the opposite of it came to me with memory of my experience at the Master's College where we oversaw student life.
[time=2967] We worked with some great students there and you would catch him at the end of the semester and they were over their head. They had procrastinated so much.
[time=2977] It was unlikely they were going to finish the semester and so they are pulling all nighters and papers and cramming and their eyes are getting all blood shot and the bags are coming and they vow to you.
[time=2988] They vow to you. This will never happen to me again.
[time=2993] Next semester, bulging eyes, blood shot, the whole thing happens all over again. Why? Because they are young yet and they are learning to be prudent.
[time=3005] They are learning to let the truth in their mind. It is really stupid not to do your homework along the way. They are learning to let that begin to control their lifestyle.
[time=3015] Their leadership shouldn't be in that learning process. They should have made it through that, be balanced in their approach to life and be able to let the truth in their mind consistently guide the action of their life.
[time=3028] The next one, prudent, respectable and the word, another word for it, would be organized. Organize is a good word to flesh the meaning out.
[time=3040] It comes from that Greek word "cosmetto" that we studied back in 2 Timothy 9 when Paul said, "I want the women to adorn themselves."
[time=3048] Remember that? To "cosmetto" themselves and what it meant was to order themselves, to be orderly in their presentation of the womanliness that is theirs as they come to church.
[time=3057] And so he is describing the idea that elders are to have an organized life. Church leadership is no place for a man whose life is full of unaccomplished plans and unorganized activities.
[time=3070] And I am particularly thankful for my wife in this regard. Now you see, when I was in college, not only did I procrastinate myself, but I never picked up my room.
[time=3080] There were times when for two weeks straight, Greg Zenakis, my roommate at that time at Cal Poly San Luis Spisbo, first year, you know, first semester, you could not see the floor of our dorm room for two weeks at a time.
[time=3093] We didn't go to a private Christian college, so there weren't any room checks, and we were just left to our own misery and the place would stink.
[time=3100] It's been a long way. I mean, now I clean up my clothes before I go to bed and I get things in the proper hamper and my closet is lined up nicely.
[time=3109] My office is, I mean, this has all been a long process for me and my wife has really been helpful because she didn't have those bad habits.
[time=3116] She was always very organized. And I kept looking at her and looking at me and thinking, I'm in trouble. You know, my car is clean, my trunk is clean, my glove box is clean.
[time=3127] And that is the sign of an organized life. That's the idea here. And it's kind of a flow of thought.
[time=3136] There is an ability in a guy to be balanced. He doesn't get thrown over here and doesn't finish that activity and thrown over here and excited about it.
[time=3143] There's a balance and a steadiest that is promoted by a mind that allows the truth therein to dictate the behavior and it produces an organized life, a basically an organized life.
[time=3156] So these are practical, very practical, ways to evaluate qualities for leadership.
[time=3163] Next, hospitable, hospitable. And so far as I've looked at these with respect to my own life, this definitely needs work in my life, hospitable.
[time=3175] We think of it with our contemporary definition, meaning you might think I have a lot of friends over and throw a lot of parties and when we do, we feed them nice food and give them good things to drink and have dessert and all that stuff.
[time=3187] And that's probably part of it. But this word hospitable is made up of two Greek words, stranger and love, loving strangers. That's what this qualification is all about.
[time=3198] An elder loves strangers. An elder opens his home to strangers. An elder invites strangers in and feeds them and gives them a place to stay and lets them sleep overnight.
[time=3211] You remember the words of our Lord over there? Luke 14, I'll read them to you. This is really a challenge because I haven't done this yet. I mean, you know, it's like, hmm, verse 12.
[time=3224] And he also went on to say to the one who had invited him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your rich neighbors, lest they all invite you in return and repayment is coming to you."
[time=3238] That happens and that's nice when that happens. Verse 13, "But when you give a reception, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed since they do not have the means to repay you for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."
[time=3256] Boy, that's tough. Now it doesn't mean we all have to run out and throw big, you know, parties for people we don't know. But it certainly puts the rubber on the road again with respect to our qualification.
[time=3268] It is a willingness and more than a willingness. It is a practice in your life that when there are people that you may not even know, some of them might be Christians passing through, others of them might be unsaved who are at a point of need like the Good Samaritan, there is a willingness and a behavior in your life that reaches out and helps them as if you knew them well.
[time=3291] To be hospitable. So above reproach, the elder is to be above reproach. There is nothing overt that somebody can take a hold of and say, "See, this is it. You're disqualified."
[time=3305] First, in the relationship with a wife, he is devoted, he is committed, he is a one woman man. That is his woman.
[time=3315] Beyond that, he is to be temperate, balanced, prudent, self-controlled, respectable, organized, and hospitable, a lover of a stranger.
[time=3328] Let me make now, just, we'll stop there in our text, but let me make a few points by way of application.
[time=3334] First is this. This is utterly important because people become like their leaders. Sheep, follow the shepherd.
[time=3346] And the Lord said everyone after he has been fully trained will be like his teacher. So it's important that you as a body of believers put the right people in leadership
[time=3359] because there is the propensity to follow them and to be like them.
[time=3364] Hosea said it this way, "Like people, like priests." Paul said it this way, "Join in following my example, Philippians 3."
[time=3372] The writer of the Hebrews said, "To imitate the faith of those who lead you." Hebrews 13.
[time=3379] The consistent pattern in biblical history demonstrates that people will sell them rise above the spiritual level of their leadership.
[time=3387] And so Paul delivers this word to you so that you can continue to bring into the office of the overseer men of godly reputation that are worth emulating.
[time=3415] We've been sharing with you today music from our sanctuary choir, the men singers, and our handbell choir.
