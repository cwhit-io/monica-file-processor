[time=0] So we continue in our study of the overseer or the elder, the men who would give
[time=6] spiritual leadership to the church and we find that they are to be above reproach. There is to be nothing in their life which overtly discredits them from the ministry, nothing that can be laid hold of in their life in the character of their life. We find this morning that they are to be able to teach and this is really the only function listed in the entire list of qualifications that they are to be able to teach. For their ability to teach is predicated on godly character. Men who do not live what they preach, unsay everything they've
[time=38] said and therefore should not be in leadership.
[time=53] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today, Pastor Moore will be presenting the third in a series of messages on church leadership from 1 Timothy chapter 3. When the world looks for a leader, it
[time=72] often looks for how successful an individual has been. What has he accomplished?
[time=76] The Bible says that we should select church leaders on the basis of their character and their relationships. How does a man relate to his wife, to his family, and to those outside the church? It's a sobering thought to realize that we are only as spiritual as our worst relationship. We suggest that you locate your
[time=95] Bible and have it open to 1 Timothy chapter 3 so that you can be prepared to study along with us. Our special music today will include a song from Susan Toyrax stomp entitled Immortal Invisible. And just before the message, Lisa
[time=111] Renaker will sing a song entitled, "He Is Able." As we prepare for our time of
[time=117] Bible study, let's begin our time of worship as our sanctuary choir in orchestra with soloist Kevin Rowe present, "Something Great."
[time=131] Every day I walk with Jesus, it gets sweeter than the day before. I've had so much
[time=137] been blessed so much. It seems it just couldn't be more, but the more you know
[time=143] about Jesus, the more you can stay it's true. Every day of your life is a new day.
[time=149] And the Lord's got something for you, something great, something great. I've been
[time=158] raised something greater from the Lord, something great, something great. I've been raised
[time=169] something greater from the Lord. I have fans and friends and loved ones. I have shelter
[time=180] from the cold. There's peace, joy and happiness and contentment for my soul. I've got
[time=187] his great salvation. Every day he gives me life. His truth is working in my life.
[time=194] He's serving him as pure delight. When you're so rich in Jesus, you're gonna prosper in
[time=222] every way. He has a straight provision for everyone every day. Now there's something more
[time=230] that you haven't yet received. Just take this little moment and sing this song with me.
[time=243] I've been raised something greater from the Lord. I have been raised something greater from the
[time=276] Lord. [Applause]
[time=306] Come stars in space and bow down to his glory. Come hearts of praise and tell his holy
[time=325] story with every rug, let every room, let every voice speak his name, let every song from
[time=332] every tongue proclaim his glory, glory, filling the night with his praise. Immortal and visible
[time=344] God only wise, enlightened, acceptable, hit from our eyes. Most blessed, most glorious, the
[time=353] ancient of days. Almighty, victorious, your great name we praise. Not with our eyes, but
[time=368] unseen, we adore him, lost in his light. We stand trembling before him with every breath,
[time=381] with every song. We love to worship his name, with every word, with every prayer. We bring
[time=387] him glory, glory, lifting our voices in praise. Immortal and visible silent as night, not
[time=400] wanting, not wasting, but ruling in light. Your justice like mountains is soaring above
[time=409] your clouds which are fountains of goodness and love. Immortal and visible.
[time=439] The now we can only see dimly, someday we'll see face to face. Love once invisible, we will
[time=453] see shining before us, crowned in a chorus of praise. Immortal and visible father of light,
[time=471] angels adore you, obeying their sight. Most blessed, most glorious, the ancient of days.
[time=481] Almighty, victorious, your great name we praise. Immortal, invisible.
[time=509] Hello and thank you for watching the Bible Hour today. We are so blessed when you get involved in the ministry of the Bible Hour and are thankful that you let us know that from time to time.
[time=519] Last week we were excited to tell you about school registration here at Black Hawk Christian School and again we want to tell you that if you're interested in information about registration and registering your children for the fall year, you can call the church here at 493-7400.
[time=539] I'll be telling you that telephone number a little bit later and as well as the address and so you just keep a pencil in hand and we'll talk about it just before we go back to the live portion of our service. We'll also wear in too much and the weather changes drastically
[time=554] around here but I think even as we as we noted the weather report today that things are definitely getting better as far as the temperature is concerned it's going to get a lot warmer.
[time=562] That's beautiful to see the sun again and see everything starting to come alive.
[time=568] I noticed that in our letter to the Founders Club members we had the scripture from Romans
[time=576] 12 to the renewing of your mind and as I was reading that passage of scripture I was thinking about how God changes the terrain here in Indiana. I mean the trees just come alive from within.
[time=590] You just see the budding of the flowers and trees and grass and you know that's a great parallel as it relates to the Christian life and how God saves us but He wants to constantly
[time=600] be renewing from within, abolstering us in our Christian lives.
[time=605] Bringing new life, new perspective, new energy for His pursuits. It really is a beautiful example in creation as every season that rolls over and we get a reminder of how the
[time=616] deadness of winter is replaced to the budding life of spring.
[time=620] Well those of you that are members of the Founders Club you get the prayer reminder that says renewing your mind. I hope you put that on your desk or on a countertop somewhere
[time=630] and as you see it you'll pray that God will strengthen your life and that He'll also strengthen the ministry of the Bible hour. We're glad to have the support from our Founders Club members and trust that you'll continue writing in and letting us know that you're watching our program. Now also we've been on the qualifications for elders and even last
[time=650] week we got toward the end of the program and I was interested in a person who is in the
[time=656] ministry that that falls away through some sin. How is his life renewed and how is he
[time=664] qualified again to minister? That's a great question and there's a need to understand what the Bible says about that because so many Christian leaders unfortunately are falling to sin and we know of many on a national level that fall to immorality or then the one
[time=680] of the qualifications we'll look at today the love of money and the question that comes what do we do with leaders who have have grossly violated the standard in 1 Timothy chapter 3 and some adulterous affair should they be restored to ministry and I think we need to make
[time=697] a distinction between forgiving those men and restoring those men. Those men are covered
[time=703] under the blood if indeed they're believers and they're forgiven by God for everything they could possibly do. I mean there is you can't out sin the grace of God so they're forgiven and they need to be forgiven by the people and received back into the fellowship and welcomed into a church but that's completely different than being restored back into a position of leadership. They have they have grossly disqualified themselves having come
[time=727] to Christ having worked through their Christian life come to a place of maturity assumed public
[time=733] ministry and said here here this is the grace of God in my life this is what God does in the renewing process and then to adulterate the word of God by physical adultery or some
[time=743] other gross violation it's really impossible to understand how they can be put back in
[time=749] a place of church leadership. There's a movement under foot around in the Christian church
[time=756] and the evangelical church when men fall to I'm thinking of one example a man in the ministry was given a year off with pay spent a few sessions with a counselor and then was brought back into a huge installation service again as if he were just embarking into the ministry for the first time and that's really weird I mean that's not how it works the Bible is so
[time=776] clear that these men who lead the church are to be above reproach doesn't mean they're perfect but when they've come to a position of leadership and then drastically fallen like that there's really no restoring them there's no way to wipe that off the slate and
[time=790] return to the ministry so while we forgive them and while we have empathy for them we care for them and we have fellowship with them it's certainly different though from being restored back into church leadership. That's very informative and that is a difficult passage of scripture but at the same time the Bible has a lot to say about the qualifications for elders and we're going to continue on that subject in just a few minutes just before we go back to the live portion of our program our gift offer for this month is a booklet entitled God's promises for your every need these are scripture verses categorized various topics
[time=823] such as worry there'll be several scripture verses on a page that'll help you cope with worry and if you've received one of these or you have something like it get one for your neighbor or for a friend that might be in need right now write us and ask for one of these booklets today you can receive God's promises by writing to the Bible hour 74 hundred east
[time=844] state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815 once again that's the Bible hour 74 hundred
[time=852] east state Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Earlier in our insert we talked
[time=861] about the registration for the Christian school once again I want to give you that telephone number again it's area code 219 493 7400 I hope that you'll write for information today
[time=874] and stay tuned with us as we continue the series of messages from first Timothy with our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=887] [MUSIC]
[time=902] Like period through window blade with rain you motions come together in a flood of
[time=915] doubt and pain we pray the best we can now we must leave it in his hands but I know when
[time=933] my eyes fail to see even though it seems impossible to me here's a boy but if it chooses
[time=962] not to move in the way we pray he would confident he's working all together for my good and
[time=974] I will stand behind his world for his evil.
[time=986] [MUSIC]
[time=996] Question seemed to hurt you night and day how could God allow your heart to be torn
[time=1010] away does he listen when you call or is he even there at all yet I know when my eyes
[time=1029] fail to see even though it seems impossible to me here's a boy but if he chooses not to
[time=1056] move in the way we prayed he would confident he's working all together for my good and I
[time=1067] will stand behind his world for his evil he's evil and that's the night he's waiting to
[time=1090] donate he reverberates way I stand to face another day and I stand behind his world for his
[time=1109] evil he's evil he's evil
[time=1127] [MUSIC]
[time=1135] Thank you Lisa putting feelings and music and expression to the truth of God Abraham said that
[time=1146] he knew that God was able and instead of growing weak and faith excuse me weak and disbelief he grew strong and faith giving glory to God what a beautiful song.
[time=1156] Well let me ask you to take your Bibles this morning as we go back to our study in 1 Timothy chapter 3 and if you're with us for the first time today or you've been away for a few weeks we are studying the book of 1 Timothy we are moving through it chapter by chapter paragraph
[time=1172] by paragraph verse by verse in an expositional manner meaning we are taking close examination of the text and seeking the truth of God and principles therein that will guide our lives
[time=1184] and we are in a passage of scripture verses 1 through 7 that's all about elders all
[time=1190] about overseers all about shepherds or pastors as they give oversight and leadership to the
[time=1196] New Testament church would you follow along as I read it it is a trustworthy statement if
[time=1203] any man aspires to the office of overseer it is a fine work he desires to do and overseer
[time=1210] then must be above reproach the husband of one wife temperate prudent respectable hospitable
[time=1217] able to teach not addicted to wine or pugnacious but gentle uncontentious free from the love
[time=1223] of money he must be one who manages his own household well keeping his children under control with all dignity but if a man does not know how to manage his own household how will he
[time=1234] take care of the church of God and not a new convert lest he become conceited and fall
[time=1240] into the condemnation incurred by the devil and he must have a good reputation with those
[time=1246] outside the church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil we've
[time=1254] been looking at these church leaders and we have found in verse one two aspects of them their identity and their aspiration their identity is that they are called overseers other places in scripture these same group of men or men who would perform a similar function the church are called elders other places pastor and that is used interchangeably these are three terms that are used to describe the same office of leadership in the church
[time=1281] some are paid by the church for their ministry others find their way of living or the support
[time=1287] for their living outside the church and volunteer their oversight but they are all the same group of men they are all the same leadership in the church and they are those that God has given to oversee the New Testament church we also identified them with their aspiration
[time=1303] they are men of strong passion and two words in this first verse describe that passion
[time=1309] the first is found at the beginning of the verse it is a trustworthy statement if any man aspires to the office of overseer reaches out and takes for himself the office of overseer
[time=1319] and then at the end of the verse a work he desires to do this is a strong word epithumia he desires
[time=1326] it deep within his soul so these are men who are giving oversight of the church and who do that out of a deep compelling passion in their heart and life to serve God but desire
[time=1339] alone does not qualify them as leaders the fact that they have a strong and ordinent desire to pursue the work of leading the church does not necessarily qualify them for that
[time=1351] and so Paul gives a list of qualifications a standard is lifted up and it is in the following verses he begins in verse 2 saying that an overseer then must be above reproach above reproach
[time=1365] is a general term it's an overarching term that really encapsulates all the other qualifications
[time=1372] that follow and all the areas that follow he must be above reproach to be above reproach literally means to take a hold of there is nothing in your life that somebody can take a hold of that it's tangible it's there it's substantial in these categories that would
[time=1387] disqualify you from leadership the standard is character the standard is godliness Paul
[time=1394] doesn't say to go out and look for men who are tall dark and handsome and put them into leadership of the church he doesn't say to go out and find the successful business people and put them into leadership in your church he doesn't say to go out and find those with great physical stature or those who are in great physical shape and put them in leadership in your church or those who make a great impression in other words leadership in the church is not qualified by giftedness whether natural or spiritual it is not qualified by some natural charisma a person may have even a level of education or even age men are
[time=1429] qualified for ministry leadership in the church by their character a character that is above reproach three categories fall to us in these verses and they're all relational the
[time=1441] first major category is that of the husband and his wife and you remember we've said that
[time=1447] that might better be translated the one woman man as opposed to the husband of one wife
[time=1453] if we take that phrase to refer to the marital status it stops becoming a spiritual qualification
[time=1459] and it starts becoming just a mere issue of status there are unbelievers who can qualify if we leave it the husband of one wife there are people who don't know Christ who don't belong in the church because they don't even know Christ who certainly are the husband of one wife have only had one wife and have had that one wife for fifty years I don't believe that's what this phrase is saying it doesn't relegate spirituality to an external condition
[time=1483] instead I believe it says and can be translated a one woman man a one woman man which stops
[time=1489] talking only about marital status and starts talking about the condition of a man's heart
[time=1495] is he completely and totally devoted to the woman who is his wife that is a spiritual
[time=1501] qualification that as our lord said in Matthew chapter five is a man who does not lust after
[time=1507] a woman for him all in his heart thereby committing adultery with her a man even in the church
[time=1513] a Christian man a man who is even in leadership can qualify if it's just an external status issue the husband of one wife may have only had and has had has only one wife but may be having
[time=1524] a fair with some other woman certainly doesn't qualify him it is an issue of the heart it
[time=1531] is an issue of simplicity and devotion to the woman he is married to it also doesn't restrict
[time=1538] men who are single from being elders in the church Paul himself was single at this time in his life and he himself calls himself an elder and so obviously this phrase can't mean
[time=1549] you have to be married this phrase is all about the disposition of the heart and the devotion and dedication of a man to his wife and if he isn't married then he's not a ladies man he's not a man running around looking for a woman we found the second major category to
[time=1564] be that of his household look at verse four he must be one who manages his own household
[time=1570] well meaning that this next sphere of relationship is the grounds on which he is qualified the
[time=1576] most intimate that with his wife begins the whole list and then he then Paul brings into view how his children respond to his leadership and we'll look at that as we move through the text the third level of evaluation or the third category of above reproachness
[time=1591] in a general way is found in verse seven he must have a good reputation with those outside the church the people who view him in the community the people from whom he buys his cars his grocery his gas the people he works with the people who live on that street the people who are not saved those who are outside the church they must think highly of him he must have a good reputation with them so we see the qualifications to be relational we see that
[time=1617] a man is qualified for ministry not based on some length of time that he's been in a particular
[time=1626] ministry or some position that he's held or even how much of the Bible he knows these don't qualify a man it is as Paul has said the goal of our instruction is love love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith it's the product of the knowledge of the word of God that qualifies a man for ministry it's the evidence of godliness in his life and the way he treats his wife his children and the unsaid in his community that qualify him well then we backed up and we're taking a little longer look at each one of these qualifications we've talked about the husband of one wife and then in verse two he is temperant prudent
[time=1662] respectable and hospitable we looked at those last week and just briefly a temperate man is a balanced man a prudent man is a man who has self control of himself a respectable man
[time=1674] is one who is organized his life is not full of unaccomplished plans and unorganized activities
[time=1680] and then he is hospitable two words in the Greek come together to make that English word hospitable a stranger of lovers excuse me a lover of strangers that'd be quite a
[time=1692] disqualification wouldn't it he is qualified for leadership because he loves strangers he
[time=1700] is able to open his home to people he doesn't even know some of them are Christians and in the ancient world they would have come from distant places traveling on in ministry or business and they wouldn't have frequented the ends of that day which were primarily given to prostitution and liquor and alcohol and all the rest and it would be unfit for them to stay there and so they would find Christians and these elders would be the kind of men who would say I never met you before I don't know where you're from but you're a believer come on in I'll give you shelter I'll give you food these men would also do that to unbelievers
[time=1732] as well they would exemplify the treatment of the good Samaritan and be open in their heart and their resources and their life even to unbelievers so they have a love for
[time=1742] strangers and that by way of review now we come this morning to new material chapter 3 verse 2 the very end of it you'll find that the elder is able to teach able to teach
[time=1756] he is skilled at teaching he is skilled at communicating the word of God and what appears
[time=1764] here is just a small phrase able to teach is really a theme it is a dominant theme in
[time=1770] the ministry of an elder or a pastor an overseer and I've talked about this with you before
[time=1776] so I don't want to be labor the point but let me walk with you through Timothy and then through second Timothy and then through Titus just to reestablish this in our thinking these three books are called the pastoral epistles these are the epistles that are written to pastors men who are elders overseers and just walk with me if you will will turn a few pages and just be reminded of how important this function is in the elder's life chapter 4 verse
[time=1800] 6 1 Timothy 4 verse 6 in pointing out these things to the brethren you will be a good servant
[time=1808] of Christ Jesus constantly nourished on the words of faith and of sound doctrine which you have been following verse 11 prescribe and teach these things verse 13 until I give
[time=1823] until I come give attention to the public reading of scripture to exhortation and teaching
[time=1829] do not neglect the spiritual gift within you he's making reference to the gift of teaching and preaching which was bestowed upon you through the prophetic utterance with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery verse 15 take pains with these things be absorbed in them so that your progress may be evident to all pay close attention to yourself and
[time=1849] to your teaching persevere in these things for as you do this you will ensure salvation
[time=1855] both for yourself and for those who hear you look at chapter 5 verse 17 let the elders
[time=1864] who rule well be considered worthy of double honor especially those who work hard at preaching
[time=1871] and teaching that word work hard could be translated to the point of exhaustion the elder
[time=1877] is one who should give himself to the ministry of the word of God to studying the word of God to the point of exhaustion if he's tired and he needs a break it should be because he's been studying the Bible too much he should be to the point of exhaustion not from frivolous activity and extraannious things but from the consistent faithful study of the word of
[time=1898] God it should wear them out then come with me to 2nd Timothy 2nd Timothy chapter 1 and
[time=1905] look at verse 13 chapter 1 verse 13 retain the standard of sound words which you have heard
[time=1913] from me in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus again the standard of sound words
[time=1920] chapter 2 verse 2 and these things which you have heard from me in the presence of many
[time=1926] witnesses these entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also so the whole
[time=1933] process of propagating the faith from one generation to the next comes because godly men who are committed
[time=1939] to the word of God teach other men who teach other men who teach other men who teach other men and all those men teach the family of God that is how the sound doctrine is preserved
[time=1950] and held unto then chapter 2 verse 15 and this is a theme for a wana which will celebrate
[time=1958] tonight thankful for that ministry because it does just this be diligent verse 15 to present
[time=1964] yourselves approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed handling accurately
[time=1970] the word of truth these are people who like a craftsman can go into his shop and he has
[time=1977] many tools and many machines and he has the raw material of the wood he is approved he is a workman he is a he is a skilled craftsman in what he produces is a work of art it's beautiful
[time=1988] and it's true to its design and so it is with the man of God who would be approved to God
[time=1995] as a workman not needing to be ashamed he can move in and through the scriptures and teach it accurately and he is consistent with its understanding of itself and he presents doctrine in clear fashion and presents that to the body of believers so that the truth is guarded
[time=2010] and held on to one other passage let's go to Titus the last of the pastoral epistles
[time=2019] in that first chapter Titus chapter 1 and look at he is giving here the same kind of qualifications
[time=2027] this is another qualification for leadership in the church there are two of them we are looking at one of them in 1 Timothy 3 this is the second time it's pretty much reiterated verses 5 through 9 look at verse 5 chapter 1 for this reason I left you in crete now speaking
[time=2042] to Titus not Timothy that you might set in order what remains and appoint elders in every
[time=2049] city as I directed you then verse 6 namely if any man be above approach and then it goes
[time=2055] right just like it does in Timothy now come to verse 9 holding fast the faithful word
[time=2062] which is in accordance with the teaching that he may be able both to exhort in sound doctrine
[time=2068] and refute those who contradict this word holding fast is a tenacious clinging to the
[time=2076] word of God in the face of fierce opposition to the truth of the word of God this describes
[time=2083] an elder who is willing to cling to the truth of the word of God in despite the what might be a popular view or a popular movement in the church he's willing to hang on to the
[time=2094] truth of God and many times he'll hold on to that in the face of opposition coming from outside the church itself persecution and sometimes it would take these men to their death they are totally committed to the word of God holding fast the faithful word which
[time=2109] is in accordance with the teaching notice in verse 9 that it says that they may be able
[time=2115] to exhort in sound doctrine to exhort paracaleo to call near these men are so familiar with
[time=2122] the word of God and so committed to it that they have the ability to in private conversation or publicly to draw people near to examine the word of God and to see for themselves what it says if we had time we could go through the New Testament and find that words usage paracaleo
[time=2138] with respect to the teaching ministry you'd find in Acts chapter 2 that it's a form of persuasion
[time=2144] their whimsical they draw people into the truth of the word of God in 2 Corinthians 8 17 it's a
[time=2151] pleading type of paracaleo where there is a passion in their heart and they're just pleading with people to obey and to respond to the word of God in 1 Thessalonians 2 it's a it's a paracaleo
[time=2163] of comfort they can use the word of God as an ointment to sav the wounds the spiritual wounds that have inflicted been inflicted by the world on the sheep and it's a source of comfort
[time=2174] 1 Thessalonians 4-1 the paracaleo there is that of encouragement and there is an energy in the communication there is an uplifting desire that comes out of that to live the word of God and
[time=2185] to be faithful to him and then 2 Timothy 4-2 this paracaleo is a patient reiterating of important
[time=2193] doctrine the elder is willing to go over it and over it and over it and over it and over it again because oftentimes people forget 80% of what they hear and so they properly review and go through
[time=2204] it again and say it different ways and try to get it deeply embedded into the hearts of the people because they must have the truth so all of that under the heading of exhort and sound doctrine
[time=2215] that's what these guys do that's why they're in leadership they have a capacity to do that they've been gifted by the Lord for that look at again at verse 9 both to exhort and sound doctrine and
[time=2226] to refute those who contradict the word refute talks about again the battle as they face off with
[time=2233] the arch enemy of the church namely Satan as he spins his webs of lies in all different forms
[time=2239] in all different fashions and he feeds them into the church sometimes through the ungodly character sometimes through even believers who want to justify their own behavior and they come up with crazy things to say about the word of God they refute that they say that is not true that is wrong
[time=2255] we stop that teaching and they do battle against false doctrine so just even here in these three books
[time=2264] the past orals we find over and over and over again the dominant theme of the elder's responsibility
[time=2270] is tied to the word of God to defending the word of God to teaching the word of God come on back
[time=2276] now to 1 Timothy chapter 3 and I want you to notice that in this list of some 20 qualifications this
[time=2286] is really the only function there this is the only thing he's got to be able to do everything else
[time=2293] he is somebody he is a man who is a one woman man he is a man who is temperate that describes who he
[time=2299] is but able to teach describes his function and you say why why in the middle of a list of
[time=2308] things that describe a man's character is there a function listed why does it come that way well I don't know for sure but I'll suggest to you that it's there because a man's ability to teach
[time=2323] is directly related to the character in his life because teaching effectively is predicated on the
[time=2332] character of the teacher you can't divorce what a teacher is from what he says when the whole
[time=2340] content of his teaching is moral as the word of God is in other words if a man doesn't live what he
[time=2347] preaches he effectively unseys with his life everything he has said with his lips and so there's
[time=2354] a list of qualifications that are character and then stuck somewhere in the middle there is this ability to teach in other words you're not able to teach godliness unless you're able to live godliness
[time=2364] because if you only talk godliness but don't live godliness you won't say everything with your life
[time=2373] the 17th century Puritan Richard Baxter said it very well said this take heed to yourselves
[time=2380] lest your example contradict your doctrine lest you unsay with your lives what you say with your tongues
[time=2387] and be the greatest hindrance of the success of your own labors one proud lordly word one needless
[time=2397] contention one covetous action may cut the throat of many a sermon and blast the fruit of all that
[time=2403] you have been doing so in a middle in the middle of character qualities there comes this one function
[time=2412] able to teach because it is so tied it is so tied the one with the other first time of the four
[time=2422] verse 11 you remember we just looked at it prescribed and teach these things look what comes next
[time=2428] look at verse 12 what's it say let no one look down on your youthfulness but rather in speech
[time=2435] conduct love faith and purity show yourself an example of those who believe they're tied in
[time=2441] extricably tied to preach and teach these things requires that you show yourself an example in
[time=2447] all of those categories turn the page if you would my Bible to page go to verse 16 pay close
[time=2458] attention to what yourself and to your teaching persevere in these things for as you do this you will
[time=2466] ensure salvation both for yourselves and for those who hear you in other words over and over and over and over again the character of a man is tied to the teaching of the man and they can't be divorced because if they are nothing good comes at it everything he says with his lips is unsaid with his life
[time=2482] well enough said more could be said we could follow through the new testament and find the importance
[time=2490] of preaching and teaching but I believe we've done that sufficiently under the women's series and so we'll move to the next group of categories look at them in verse three first Timothy three three
[time=2501] there are five of them here but I believe they're tied together verse three not addicted to wine
[time=2508] that's one of them pugnacious gentle unconscious and free from the love of money you say how are
[time=2517] they related why are they grouped because it describes people who are not in control of themselves they're under the influence of something else the first one is they're under the influence of alcohol
[time=2530] the second one which I find here would be in pugnacious and gentle and unconscious this is people
[time=2537] who are given to fighting given to fighting if you're pugnacious you're a fighter if you're
[time=2543] unconscious you're you're not a fighter if you are contentious you are a fighter and I say these men are under the control of anger these men have given up the control of their life not the alcohol but to their own anger and then in verse three the end of it free from the love of money these men are under the control control of money or the dollar so the disqualification and all of these is that
[time=2564] the interests of the church will not be pursued by these men or this man because he is under the
[time=2570] influence of something other than the Holy Spirit and the word of God in that he's addicted to wine
[time=2576] literally means he's beside wine he is he lingers alone with wine he is addicted he's an alcoholic he is dependent on the alcohol that has become his god alcohol is his lord it is the preoccupying
[time=2589] reality of his life it is ruined him for he can no longer act on principle conviction and moral
[time=2596] resolve instead the guiding light of his life is alcohol when do I get my next drink men like that
[time=2606] are not to lead the church they are not clear headed they are not capable of looking at a situation objectively even in their own life much less the lives of everybody else they're not under the control of God they're under the control of alcohol then the second disqualifying thing pugnacious
[time=2623] that literally means a striker one who gives blows one who is quick with his fists when provoked
[time=2630] he's ready to duke it out in the physical literal way a contentious man the opposite of unconscious
[time=2636] a contentious man doesn't use his fists to fight he uses lips and arguments and is the landscape
[time=2643] of his life is littered with arguments littered with people he can't get along with everywhere he looks he has arguments and there's strife and there's contention and there's things that shouldn't be there he can't get along with anybody and the opposite of both of those is right in the middle of it he's he's gracious he's gentle which means he's willing to give up his rights it's a forebearing
[time=2664] spirit man really you can offend him deeply and profoundly and he doesn't rise to the occasion and demand his rights he thinks clearly about the situation and takes action which would promote the kingdom of God sometimes he stands up for his rights sometimes he doesn't but he's not driven by anger what calls his shots in those difficult trying situations where he is being challenged or
[time=2684] his teaching is being challenged or his family is being challenged is what would advance the kingdom of God he is under control of himself these other men are quick to explode an attire rate of anger
[time=2696] sometimes though they are slow burners and when they are angered by you you barely know it they take it inside of them and they look for subtle and manipulative ways to vent their anger and are equally destructive in the church they have track records for disagreement with everyone in
[time=2713] their life they're absolutely dominated by their anger it has become the energy of their life they go from one argument and disagreement to the next and without an argument without a good fight they don't know why to get up in the morning there's no energy there's no positive thing happening in their life they're basically reacting from argument to argument to argument as we've said that
[time=2734] man is disqualified he is unqualified for leadership because he won't be in the church to lead the church he'll be in the church to look for a fight and he'll fight about the color of the building or he'll fight about the carpet or he'll fight about some doctrine or he'll fight about some implementation of some policy but you can bet he'll find a fight and he won't care how it impacts the church and he won't care how it's taught in the word all he wants is an issue and an argument if you've ever had an elder like that you're thankful when his term is up because you can't go
[time=2764] anywhere and I'm thankful that I don't know of one like that here we have godly men I love to hear
[time=2772] them use the word yield they'll yield what's great about our elder meetings is we can disagree with
[time=2778] each other we can open the word of God we can talk different perspectives we can offer different opinions and perspective and at the end we can come together and say but this is the way we're going to go and those who were opposing say well that's fine with me I just wanted to make sure you knew my perspective and I'll yield to that and then you find weeks down the road and months down the road these men are faithful to that and they they stay with what they said they would do and they support that general direction that's godliness godliness isn't always right being right
[time=2806] godliness isn't always knowing the answer and having to force it and making everybody comply to it godliness is the ability to yield with maturity for the sake of the greater good
[time=2818] second Timothy 2 24 I'll just read it to you couldn't be any planer says this and the Lord's bond service must not be quarrelsome but be kind to all able to teach
[time=2830] patient went wronged with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition if perhaps god may grant
[time=2836] them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth and that's the whole point when you're being disagreed with it's not to get your point clear it's to win the person back to obedience to Christ
[time=2848] and sometimes that rigid agitated fighting quarrelsome attitude does the exact opposite and you
[time=2854] may be exactly right with the word of God but you push everybody away with your attitude so men who would lead the church are not to be that way not quick to blows not fighting in full
[time=2865] of strife but instead they are gentle they will give up their rights in fact if that advances the kingdom of god well then this last one the lover of money free from the love of money literally
[time=2877] it's fond of silver they love the stuff it has become the controlling dictate and monarch of
[time=2884] their life Jesus said you can't serve god and maman at the same time it's impossible and if you've
[time=2891] given your life to the service of money if that has become your god if you're enslaved to it then
[time=2897] you have no place leading the church because all of your decisions all of your way of thinking about
[time=2903] the church and financial matters in the church and will be skewed terribly by that love these are
[time=2910] not people who we see walking down the street with some ball and chain with money attached to the
[time=2916] end of it it's not always obvious it's a slavery of the heart it's a slavery of the mind it
[time=2922] it covers and impermeates all of his thinking about every decision whether it's new shoes for his kid or a new house or a savings account or how much they'll give to the church that year or whatever it is the guiding principle and all their thinking the love of money and what should be the guiding
[time=2938] principle and all of those decisions and choices is the love of god this is his money how does he want me to spend it so it is a slavery of heart and mind to money itself it is the guiding factor in
[time=2952] all their decisions now I want to add that this does not mean that an elder cannot be blessed by
[time=2960] god financially this does not mean that only poor people can serve as elders this does not mean that
[time=2966] if a man has been blessed by god with financial well-being that he is therefore disqualified from
[time=2972] leadership that's not what it says it's a matter not of your income but of your motive it's the
[time=2978] hanging on and loving after and seeking money that is the disqualifying factor not the fact that you happen to have some and I believe that the amount of money that we have as individuals is just
[time=2990] just as sovereignly given as gifts some people have more than others because that's how god
[time=2996] designed it now certainly there is this principle if you don't work you don't eat and if you don't work you can bet you won't have any money unless you inherited it but beyond that general principle god just sovereignly gives some people more money than he does others and it's not a spiritual qualification negatively or positively there are poor people there are people with very little money
[time=3016] people who have difficulty paying the monthly bills in a very basic lifestyle who love money
[time=3022] and they are disqualified they don't have any but they love it that's the disqualifying part
[time=3029] and there are others who have tons of money more money than they could know what to do with and don't love it haven't fixed their affections on it and use it wisely and dispense it as god would
[time=3040] have them and they're qualified and the inverse could be true people with none may not love it and
[time=3046] therefore are qualified and people with tons may love it and therefore are disqualified it's the motive of the heart and what is so critical about it is if you've given your heart to money
[time=3057] you're blind you can't see spiritual discernment is gone and you'll be of no use to leading the church
[time=3069] the passage comes to my mind about money and about its blinding impact it says this do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves
[time=3080] break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys where thieves do not break in or steal for where your treasure is what there will your
[time=3090] heart be also and then he gives an illustration of that the lamp of the body is the eye if therefore
[time=3097] your eye is clear your whole body will be full of light if your eyes are working if your eyes are
[time=3103] functioning if they're taking in light and responding those signals to the brain your body's full of light and you can direct your course with wisdom and you don't fall into the ditch and you don't walk into the wall and all the other things that blind people have to contend with that's the
[time=3117] description of someone who is laying up their treasures in heaven they've got clear eyesight spiritually but if your eye is bad your whole body will be full of darkness if therefore the light
[time=3129] that is in you is darkness how great is the darkness and the parallel is obvious if you're blind
[time=3135] physically you can't see you're just stumbling into everything people who have given their lives to the pursuit of money are blinded spiritually they may be saved but at some measure they cannot
[time=3146] have or they do not have the spiritual discernment that others who haven't given themselves to that do and then he concludes his statement with this no one can serve two masters for either he will
[time=3159] hate the one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and man and and so here he puts these affections at direct opposite to each other they're not
[time=3170] compatible they are in opposition to each other so those who would lead the church must be free
[time=3182] from the love of money well as we close let me give a few points of application to what we've
[time=3191] tried to say today we'll come back next week and I want to spend a little time on this next
[time=3198] qualification he manages his household well no need to rush through that that's critical and then we'll talk about the reputation with those outside the church but let me say this first of all by way of application number one you can't you can't get it any clearer it can't be any more obvious in scripture that the people who are to lead the church are to be profoundly grounded in the word of God able to teach given to the word of God and I just want to offer a few suggestions
[time=3224] on how to get there if you're not there if you're not where you want to be in your study of the word of God if you feel like that would be a disqualification for you and you say how can I change that whether you want to be an elder or you just want to be a godly mature Christian let me give you this suggestion pick a book of the Bible and read it 30 times once every day for a month
[time=3249] same book and if it's a big book like Matthew read the first five chapters for the first month
[time=3255] chapters one through five day one then day two then day three just read it over and over and tell you read it 30 times then take the next five chapters in that book then take the next five chapters in that book and then you're almost finished move on through till you're finished with the entire book of Matthew take you four or five months when you're done doing that guess what you know
[time=3275] Matthew you've read it so many times not only do you know it but you can see it in your head
[time=3284] you can see the chapter one starts on the right page left hand column at the top you can see that Jesus discussion about not committing adulterable with a woman in her heart is in
[time=3295] is on the right hand page in the middle section of the left hand calling you know the word of God
[time=3301] you can see it in your mind's eye and as you're reading it over and over and over and over and over again pick up a commentary and find out why was this book written why did Matthew write Matthew
[time=3312] he wrote Matthew to present Christ as king and his kingdom offer and then begin to relate all the
[time=3319] contents of that book back to that one central theme and it'll all start to flow in your mind and you'll be able to walk from chapter to chapter to chapter to chapter to chapter to chapter to chapter with the content making its obvious contribution to the great theme of the book that's called knowing Matthew if you find something along the way that really sparks your interest then get a commentary out and learn about that little part of that detail but don't be moved from the vast scope and movement of that book when you're done with that do Romans when you're done with that do Ephesians and when you're done with that new revelation four new testament books from Matthew you'll
[time=3352] learn all about Christ and the kingdom program from Romans you'll learn all the doctrine you could ever want to know from Ephesians you'll learn about the church and from the revelation you'll learn
[time=3363] about the end of the age if you were to do that might take a year maybe a little longer five chapters
[time=3370] every day augment it with some peripheral study you're gonna know the Bible you're gonna know the
[time=3376] Bible better than 90 percent of the people in the world alive today it's not that hard it just
[time=3384] takes some kind of commitment to do that and then one of the thought for you find somebody to teach
[time=3390] find somebody
