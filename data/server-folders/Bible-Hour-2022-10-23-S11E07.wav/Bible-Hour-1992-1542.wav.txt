[time=0] And so this morning we come back to take a final look at what Paul says, our
[time=6] qualifications for leadership. And the qualification we have in view this morning is that an elder must be one who manages his own household well, keeping his children under control with all dignity. The question is asked if a man is
[time=23] nominated for the position of eldership in the church, what his children vote for him. We'll examine that in great detail this morning.
[time=32] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we
[time=48] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today
[time=54] Pastor War will be concluding his series of messages on church leadership from 1 Timothy chapter 3. We have all heard stories of men who have become great leaders in business or government, but who have failed at home to be good fathers and husbands. For those who aspire to lead in the church, God's word states that they must manage their family well and be respected by their children. If you are nominated for the church leadership, would your children vote for you? We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to first Timothy chapter 3 so that you will be prepared to study along with us. Our special
[time=89] music today will include a song from Beckywoman entitled "There is Peace" and just before the message, our handbell choir will present a number entitled "Two Meditations from the Cross." As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's
[time=105] begin our time of worship and meditation as our sanctuary choir presents "Thou art worthy." [MUSIC]
[time=138] "Thou art worthy." [MUSIC]
[time=355] [APPLAUSE]
[time=363] [MUSIC]
[time=385] "Thou art worthy." [MUSIC]
[time=681] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour today. Russell this is another Lord's Day and we look forward to great things that are happening as we worship together.
[time=693] Well it is it's just a absolute joy to anticipate Sunday and to know we'll be in the house of the Lord with God's people and worshipping Him and praising Him.
[time=701] If you are watching or looked for the Bible Hour last week on channel 21, our local station here in Fort Wayne, you no doubt realize that we were preempted by the Easter Seal TeleThon.
[time=711] There were a number of our choir members and young people that were involved behind the phones in that great campaign and we're glad that you've tuned in again today for our program.
[time=721] There are some special events coming up in the life of Backhock Baptist Church and Russell a lot of times people ask me do we have other formats besides what they see on television here at the church and much of our other types of activities are done in our evening service.
[time=737] One such event is the children's musical put on by the praise kids that's grades 4, 5 and 6. On Sunday evening March 22nd they'll be presenting celebration, salvation celebration.
[time=751] A great evening of music and drama by these kids and Russell they really get into it. They learn a lot of scripture, good music and it's a really exciting time.
[time=761] Well it's absolutely captivated my eldest daughter Randy who is a part of this musical and she just sings the music all the time and she's so excited she comes to play practice or musical practice every Sunday afternoon wouldn't miss it.
[time=773] You know they just get so involved and I'm thankful for these kinds of ministries at our church that reinforce the values in our kids lives.
[time=782] Let me just give you that day again that Sunday evening March 22nd at 6 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church come and join with us for this children's musical salvation celebration.
[time=793] And then as we've done for a number of years we're going to have a good Friday service at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=802] Also this will be your first time we have a half hour program there it's rather limited but we do involve it during the lunch hour so many of our people that work downtown can invite some of their friends.
[time=814] Yeah and that is the idea what a tremendous opportunity to bring the significance of Christ to people at that time of the year and I'm thankful we can do that all year long.
[time=823] It is learning from some of the people in our church even this week one of our visitation calls on Wednesday night somebody prayed to receive Christ as their savior and another man that works and one of the businesses here in town was sharing the gospel with one of the janitors where he works and that person came to know Christ it's exciting to see us embracing Christ and sharing Christ and this will be a great event as well in that process.
[time=849] You know our young people are getting ready to go down to Florida for the annual operation outreach and they are training and I know some of our young people my son went to the mall and witnessed last week and that's really exciting because just it is it's Easter for us all the time but this will be a special date and we want to put it once you to put it on your calendar.
[time=869] It's Friday as April 17th and it will be from 1215 to 1245 at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne. Please note that and come and join with us for this wonderful service.
[time=881] And then for the Easter program here at Black Hawk Baptist Church will be presenting it twice on Saturday evening April 18th and Sunday evening April 19th.
[time=891] On Saturday evening will be at 7 p.m. Sunday evening 6 p.m. and the drama is Spark in Judea and if you'd like to learn more about that let me give you the telephone number where you can call into the office and will give you some more information about tickets.
[time=906] You can call 493 7400 and the area code is 219. Those are very exciting events that will inspire you during this Easter season. I hope you'll come and join with us.
[time=919] And then last week we began offering to you the book that entitled God's Promises for Your Every Need. Here are some topics that will really help you with your spiritual life.
[time=929] Topics such as Courage, Issues About Worry and Stress in Your Life, Scripture Verses that will encourage you for all of those circumstances.
[time=938] I hope that you'll write for this wonderful book right now, right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Just ask for God's promises and once again the address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=962] We're going to go back now to some more music and then the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore, stay tuned with us for some inspiration from God's Word.
[time=993] [MUSIC - 109 seconds]
[time=1112] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1130] Boy, that's great. This little lot of mine, I'm going to let it shine. It's also good to know that our church is doing that on a regular basis. I'm always so excited to continue to hear the reports of how we let our light shine in the community.
[time=1143] Two of them this week came to me from one of our EE teams on Wednesday night was out sharing the gospel and a person prayed to receive Christ and now that light shines in their heart as well.
[time=1154] Her from another man and our family, our fellowship here, a part of our church who was sharing the gospel with one of the janitors where he works and that janitor prayed to receive Christ.
[time=1164] It's neat that we not only play the songs but we live the reality and we're seeing the light of Jesus Christ beaming forth from this church by God's grace.
[time=1174] Well, about 130 years ago back when the wild west was still wild and before the telegraph really connected the west coast with the east coast and vice versa.
[time=1188] Back when it took about three months for a letter to get from the east coast out to California partly because it had to go by sea and then by barge and then by mule, three men by the name of Russell majors and waddle came up with a great idea to get the mail from basically Nebraska to Sacramento guaranteed ten days.
[time=1208] They called it the pony express in order to do this great new venture they needed men and they ran an ad and it ran this way wanted young skinny wierry fellows not over eighteen must be expert writers willing to risk death daily orphans preferred wages twenty five dollars per week.
[time=1235] Well more than a hundred men immediately responded no doubt excited by the romance of running away from eight Indians while speeding across the frontier on horseback.
[time=1246] One of the young men that responded was Buffalo bill Cody he was fourteen years of age but the overland express as they were as the company was called would not allow them to carry even one piece of mail.
[time=1262] Until they first pledged themselves to be men above reproach each had to take the vow and this is the one that Buffalo bill Cody took at the age of fourteen years.
[time=1274] I William Cody do by hereby swear before the great and living God that during my engagement and while I am in employee of Russell majors and waddle.
[time=1285] Under no circumstances use profane language that I will drink no intoxicating lickers that I will not quarrel or fight with any other employee of the firm and that in every respect I will conduct myself honestly be faithful to my duties and so direct all my acts as to win the confidence of my employers so help me God.
[time=1308] And having taken that pledge to be above reproach he was given a job and did it faithfully so far as we know.
[time=1316] Well God has been trying to deliver the mail not for just a hundred and thirty years but for centuries you hold it in your hands today it's a composition of letters letters that are all inspired by the word of God written by over forty different authors and the one we look at today is the letter first Timothy.
[time=1332] So if you have your Bible let me ask you to turn there first Timothy chapter three and we have in view this morning men who would carry this letter not just the actual letter in parchment but the truth of the letter in their lives from one generation to the next and they too must take an oath they must take an oath of being above reproach.
[time=1356] One major difference here of course is that while these young men were applying to be a part of the pony express they merely had to promise that while in the employment of the pony express they would keep this code of behavior.
[time=1369] Yet what we have here in this list of qualifications that Paul gives to Timothy isn't a promise I will abstain or I will be like this list it is in fact I already am.
[time=1380] I already have been living this way I already am qualified but they're called not writers of horseback but overseers chapter three verse one.
[time=1390] Overseers otherwise known as elders or pastors sometimes paid by the church and sometimes paid by a firm or some other place and yet they offer their leadership voluntarily to the church free of charge.
[time=1404] The number one part of their oath the number one qualification the overarching phrase that really captures everything that follows is this idea of being above reproach and it means that someone can't take a hold of anything in your life.
[time=1419] There's nothing major or significant in your life that would be enough for them to get a good grip on it and say nope this person is not qualified to lead the church.
[time=1429] We've seen that that falls under three major categories and they're all relational the first is found in chapter three verse two the husband of one wife.
[time=1440] The first relational area that we are to examine these men in with respect to their above reproachness is how they treat their wife are they truly devoted to her are they committed simple in their devotion to that one woman.
[time=1453] The second major category we come to this morning and it's found in verse four he must be one who manages his own household well keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=1465] If a man does not know how to manage his own household how will he take care of the church of God and that's what we're going to look at this morning and I want to say it to you this way I want to give you three reasons three reasons why an elder must manage his own household well.
[time=1485] See if these don't make sense to you the word manage means to stand first or to rule to manage to be in charge of.
[time=1494] The first reason I believe that an elder must manage his household well is this you're not a leader you're not a leader unless people are following you.
[time=1506] You're not a leader unless people are following you leadership is not a title leadership is not a position leadership is not some position that some board of directors gives you leadership is a function and the function of leadership is influencing people to follow you.
[time=1523] If no one is following you despite your title or your position you're simply not leading and you may not even be a leader.
[time=1532] So the idea that Paul is testing here is these men must be leaders of the church and first we'll find out if their leaders in the home the question is are their children following them.
[time=1544] And it's tough that way I mean this is a very exacting examination of leadership or of qualification for church leadership because how do you know what makes a leader a leader.
[time=1554] I mean Hitler was a great leader a lot of people were following him a lot of people were laying down their life for his cause and for his vision now we don't agree with where he was leading people or how he treated those who were following him.
[time=1568] But in the truest sense eight off Hitler was a great leader because there was a great host of people not only willing to follow but willing to die for his cause but he was short and somewhat nondescript an appearance apart from the little mustache under his nose he kind of looked odd or weird in many different pictures that you see him his style of preaching was almost fanatical and bombastic he would rant and he would rave I mean what about that man made him a leader certainly not as appearance in his and his style so much.
[time=1597] But somehow it all came together and people followed him in contrast to that you could think of Abraham Lincoln I mean tall and kind of Lanky and ugly in his facial features are large and exaggerated ears and nose and mouth and he certainly wasn't given the bombastic and aggravating agitating speeches he was instead rather mild in his manner but he was a leader and a great leader people followed him.
[time=1624] Churchill looked different than both kind of short and stocky and his weapon was an assort it was of course his words and somehow in the mystery of his personality and charisma people followed people followed in desperate situations so in essence these leaders leaders of the church not necessarily tested in times of civil war or any other kind of world war tested in the day to day grind of leading their family.
[time=1653] Leaders of the church must be able to lead their children the second reason the second reason that elders must be able to manage their homes is this the skill required to lead the home the skill required to lead the home is so very much like the skill required to lead the church they are very parallel they are very similar
[time=1681] the skill to lead IBM is not the same necessarily the same kind of skill required to lead Black Hawk Baptist Church the skill to lead a major organization some organization that exists to make a profit to have a profitable bottom line it potentially has a very different managerial style and skills required there may be very different but that's not true when you compare the church and the home there they are very similar
[time=1708] may I show that to you come with me to first Thessalonians first Thessalonians chapter two here Paul is describing his church leadership and he uses terms that obviously are parallel to the home
[time=1728] and we can gain much from his explanation of his leadership first Thessalonians chapter two verse seven he said but we proved to be gentle among you as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children having thus a fond affection for you we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel but also our own lives because you had become very dear to us
[time=1755] for you recall brother in our labor and hardship how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you we proclaim the got to you the gospel of God
[time=1765] at this point he says my leadership of the church my involvement with the church of God was very much like the way a mother treats her children tender loving care fond affection something inside of him was really in love with them and really was compassionate towards them and really cared for them
[time=1782] in a way that a president of IBM or GE or some other major corporation would often not feel towards his employees and towards the organization there is a motherly instinct in his leadership for them
[time=1797] he goes on if that's the tender side look at verse 10 here comes a little more of the visionary directive side
[time=1805] verse 10 you are witnesses and so is God how devotely and uprightly and blamelessly we behaved toward you believers
[time=1814] verse 11 just as you know how we were exhorting and encouraging and imploring each one of you as a father would his own children so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you into his own kingdom and glory
[time=1830] and he pictures here his role with them as a father who exhorts and encourages and implores to do what verse 12 to walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you
[time=1843] he's lifting up the standard he's holding up the the principle of obedience and he's calling them on to excellence through his exhortation and his encouraging and his imploring to meet the standard
[time=1854] so both are found in his heart both are found in his life as he gives leadership both that tender genuine fond affection of people
[time=1863] and the vision of the kingdom of God and all that it should be and all that the people should be in light of the kingdom of God
[time=1871] and those are to be bound up inside the leader's heart in his home first and then in his church
[time=1881] many men don't have this kind of commitment in the home and therefore should not lead in the church
[time=1887] many men do not well manage their home and therefore are not qualified their children are out of control
[time=1894] their children are manipulative their children are domineering their children have found subtle ways to in fact control the home
[time=1903] they are out from under the control of their father and they assume to a place of control it's never been declared it's never been officially stated as such
[time=1912] but if you're with these people long you can soon realize that the children are directing and running the show
[time=1918] the children are the ones that set the schedule the children are the ones that determine what we're going to watch on television
[time=1924] the children are the ones that determine which restaurant we're going to go to the children are the one who say what mom's going to fix for dinner
[time=1930] the children are the children of the ones who determine the family schedule even direct the budget by their demands as they want this and they want that
[time=1937] vacations are chosen entirely sometimes upon the whim of the child all in an effort just to somehow keep peace in the household
[time=1945] and the father instead of leading and taking all of these things into consideration and purpose where the family will go
[time=1951] in light of the needs of the children and the wife just finds it a little bit easier a little bit easier a life works a little bit better if he'll just kind of acquiesce and follow
[time=1962] it's not healthy weak men produce weak homes weak homes produce weak churches and weak churches produce weak societies and it's everywhere in America today children by the way are not the center of the home the husband wife relationship is the center of the home that's why the home exists that's how it came into existence
[time=1987] a love between a man and a woman and at the center of the home and should always be at the center of the home beyond God and Christ of course and the human level is the relationship of that husband to that wife that is the center of the whole thing
[time=1999] you say well where the children fit in well they're welcomed guests they're welcomed guest and they should know that they should feel warmly welcome in the home but they are not the center of the home and that home does not exist to make them happy and to grant every women every wish and when they don't get their every women every wish and they start to make life difficult on everybody concerned and the father tends at that point to back up and acquiesce and give away his leadership he is also given away his leadership in the church two things I think and here I am a total of 33 years old with my eldest at ten who might have told a lot of you people anything about raising children all right I know that but still I got a preach on this passage two things two things in every situation that I try to give my children the very strong impression
[time=2050] two things in every situation where we're involved in some kind of conflict number one I love you I love you very much I am committed to you as an individual
[time=2063] I want them to be assured of that the second thing I want them to be very aware of is that there are consequences to their choices
[time=2071] there are consequences to their choices if I am a man who says we will do this and if we don't do this you'll be disciplined and then they don't do it
[time=2081] and I don't discipline them they learn and begin to believe there is such a thing as a consequence less life
[time=2087] and I couldn't love them less at that moment until I allow that to be reinforced day after day after day after day
[time=2094] I sometimes affectionately refer myself to myself in the home as the great king Kahuna
[time=2101] law I speak you obey why because they need to learn that
[time=2108] and they need to learn that when I have spoken and they have not obeyed there are consequences those are usually they know that long before that event ever occurs and I want them both to feel somehow for me that I am like this mother who tenderly cares for her own children
[time=2125] with fond affection who is well pleased to impart to them not only the gospel but my own life
[time=2132] I want them to feel that I'll give my life away for them that I'm tender that I am soft that I care
[time=2138] and at the same time I want them to know that as the father the kingdom of God is at stake and they must learn that the king is in charge
[time=2144] and while I am his earthly representative they best learn to obey for there are consequences if they don't
[time=2151] now what consequences you choose in your home may be different than the ones that I choose in mind but I do believe that in every situation
[time=2158] our children need to have both of those things coming at them petal to the metal full throttle
[time=2164] I love you I'm committed to you there are consequences to your choices
[time=2171] time will tell as the more family continues to grow up in front of all of you and we'll see how all that works
[time=2181] so I believe there is no better place to see a man's commitment to meeting the needs of others than in his own church
[time=2188] does he care about his family does he take time to know each individual child and it's bent and it's peculiar nature
[time=2195] and the way that God put it together and once he knows that is he willing to move into that person's life
[time=2201] with real effectiveness and support and love and yet a commitment to building them for the kingdom of God
[time=2207] if he'll do that with his kids he'll do that in the church if he won't do that with his kids he won't do that in his church
[time=2213] that's what Paul's saying so the test is are his children under control let's go back now to 1 Timothy 3
[time=2225] and look at a third reason it's this the priority of the family over the church
[time=2234] I believe that when Paul says he must be one in verse 4 who manages his own household well
[time=2240] keeping his children under control with all dignity then he says if a man doesn't know how to manage his own household
[time=2247] how will he take care of the church of God he implies a priority there he implies that the family is more important than the church
[time=2255] a man's ministry in his home is more important than his ministry in the church I believe that
[time=2261] I believe that I believe that because the Bible says that in other places as well as it implied here
[time=2267] and I believe that as I have experienced my short time in life so far
[time=2273] at the masters college as vice president of student affairs there for six years when the situation would become difficult
[time=2279] in a discipline scenario and had gone up through the resident directors and the deans the last stop was my office
[time=2286] and I want to share with you do you know who the most callous kids were that I saw in those six years
[time=2293] do you know who the most resistant to the word of God were and when I would try to use a scripture or a principle from the word of God
[time=2300] they get a glazed look of hate and disdain on their face for yet another Bible verse
[time=2308] you want to know who the most self destructive kids were and their behavior the ones that were dealing with anorexia
[time=2314] and bulimia and reckless sexual behavior and self destructive knife slicing of their wrist type behavior
[time=2321] and taking a pills for you want to know who by far and above led the list you know the children of pastors
[time=2332] the children of pastors were the most difficult callous hardened cases we ever saw
[time=2340] and more often than that it was the daughters of pastors
[time=2346] and I see these girls come in and shut the door and start to tell me their story
[time=2353] and explain to me what they're thinking and I just could see my one of four I have a lot of options here there's a lot of room for us to have these kinds of problems one of four in my I can see one of my daughters sitting there
[time=2367] talking to now a different dean of student and she's talking about me and she's saying you know what my dad loved his ministry more than he loved me how do I know that he was most excited about his ministry he spent most of his time in the ministry when there was a counseling crisis he went when there was a medical crisis he went when he had to finish his studies he went and he was gone so much and then when he came home if I was out of line he hit me over the head with a Bible verse and said get back in order because if you're not in order I can't stay in the ministry
[time=2400] it happened girl after girl after girl after girl different words different circumstances different parts of the country but the same story Paul is saying to men in the ministry whether paid like me or whether lay like many of our elders
[time=2415] hey let me help you out your family is your first priority don't even think about sacrificing your family for the church
[time=2427] had a conversation with the staff about three months ago and in our staff meetings on Wednesdays
[time=2433] they're just blessed times we spend three or four hours together and we always open with a devotion and then we spend time and prayer and we pray for the needs of the church sometimes we pray for each other on specific needs and I was feeling burdened to share a need with them
[time=2446] about one of my daughters who I just felt like we were missing it the relationship wasn't there
[time=2452] we weren't connecting you know the eye to eye stuff there was a glazed look and I'd give love
[time=2458] and it wasn't received it was pushed away and I'd give discipline and it would just feel like things were being driven inside
[time=2464] and it was very confusing and very alarming and I said you know please guys you need to pray for me
[time=2470] I'm going to make some adjustments here in my schedule and I'm going to try to focus in on this one particular girl
[time=2476] and I'm going to try to see if that won't make a little bit of a difference such that the intangible part of relationship will come back
[time=2484] and they were faithfully praying for me and I said to them you know and I'll tell you what if these if these first set of adjustments in my time and priorities don't make the difference I'm going to make some more adjustments and then I'm going to make some more adjustments and if need me I'm going to adjust myself completely out of the ministry because that one little girl in her life is more important to me than any ministry in the world
[time=2512] I think that's what he's saying love your family give yourself to your family that is your first priority and if you can love them in such a way
[time=2523] as you struggle through life with them and she's making their make mistakes and you're making mistakes but yet somehow in the midst of it all God can give the grace for the household to be well managed
[time=2534] and the children are under control then consider some leadership in the church
[time=2540] but if that's not the case step out step out what does it look like when those when the house is being
[time=2552] managed that way well look at your Bible there verse 4 he must be one who manages his own household well
[time=2558] keeping his children under control is the word control with all dignity it's just the word submission
[time=2564] and it means to place yourself underneath to line yourself up underneath the authority
[time=2570] and as we think about that in the New Testament we our mind goes to Ephesians chapter 6 where it says that children obey your parents
[time=2576] and then it says an honor your father and mother and of course in those two words is both the external behavior of obeying the command
[time=2584] obeying the rules and then that other word honor talks about that inner disposition of reverence
[time=2591] in other words respect I do it externally and I do it internally I obey you externally and I obey you internally
[time=2599] and that's what's being called for here now let's be honest with each other no man will have total control
[time=2605] or submission of his children at all times we live in a rebellious age since Satan did his thing with Adam
[time=2612] and even the garden this whole age is best marked by the word rebellion we are a people in rebellion against God
[time=2618] and our children are rebellious people and as we are rebellious people so it's not that every minute of every day is absolute bliss and perfect harmony and perfect relationship and absolute control
[time=2630] it is instead back to this overarching phrase above reproach when you look at the whole
[time=2636] when you look at the characteristic pattern of the life does the man manage his household well and are his children under control
[time=2644] a lot of times when you talk about this thing this type of thing people say well what happens if an elder's child
[time=2650] were to have a fling with drugs or to be involved in pregnancy outside of marriage or to have some type of illegal behavior going on
[time=2658] and I would say and this is more my opinion and the experiences that we've had at Grace Community Church and such places
[time=2666] but I don't think any one event in the life of a child is what's in view here
[time=2672] there may be a very difficult set of circumstances and a kid will maybe experiment with drugs or maybe end up pregnant or have impregnated someone else
[time=2681] or these kinds of things and when you get into some of that I think the man in question needs to bring his situation to the other elders on the board
[time=2691] and say guys this is my situation this is as I see it please help please look and help me evaluate should I step out
[time=2698] for a time should I step out for forever should I change some of the things that I'm doing in the way that I'm relating
[time=2706] in other words I don't think the best person to evaluate whether or not he's disqualified at that point is that guy
[time=2712] I think he takes that to the other elders I think the elders gain input from connected people in the family and the church
[time=2719] and there's a lot of options there but the clear message is that the household needs to be under control
[time=2728] needs to be managed well the children need to be under control and I need to add one thing to that with you if you'll go to Titus back two books Titus chapter one
[time=2744] Titus chapter one your member has another listing of qualifications for the same office elder
[time=2750] instead this time Paul is talking to Titus who is in Crete if you look in verse six
[time=2758] namely if any man be above reproach the husband of one wife having children who believe
[time=2764] having children who believe in other words a man who would be a leader in the church and elder in the church
[time=2772] his children need to believe the gospel they need to be saved they need to have faith in Jesus Christ
[time=2779] the man whose children do not believe discredit his ministry we will not only follow you into a way of life
[time=2790] but we're not going to follow you into the most important part of life namely a personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[time=2798] and this is tough because they have their own mind right I mean they have their own will they're own people
[time=2805] and yet somehow the leader could be disqualified by that other person not expressing faith in Jesus Christ
[time=2814] having children who believe the Christian faith of their fathers and who adorned that faith with godly kanda that's what's being described
[time=2826] men who are qualified to lead the church have children who believe the Christian faith of their fathers and who adorned that faith with a godly conduct
[time=2838] the man whose children are not saved or behave as though they are not saved must not be appointed as elder
[time=2847] and I believe that in a way this is almost a divine stamp of approval on those who would aspire to leadership because it is out of their control
[time=2858] I mean you can control your temper and be temperate and you can organize your life and be respectable and you don't need anybody for that
[time=2864] you can open your house to strangers and and be a lover of strangers and you don't need anybody for that either
[time=2870] that's just you and you but when you talk about the affect of your leadership in your kids life now you're back on your knees saying "God help"
[time=2881] I can't produce that I can't guarantee that and if I do try to guarantee it and if I do strangle their little necks trying to make them look just like what they're supposed to look like
[time=2890] I'm probably going to see more rebellion than I know what to do with and I think it's a good thing that it's there as a requirement because it forces the men who would aspire to leadership to again be forced to acknowledge their dependence on God
[time=2904] men there are a lot of things here that are out of your control and it causes them to grab lightly onto their ministry
[time=2911] to keep to keep an open hand in their ministry God may take it away
[time=2917] instead of grabbing a hold of them smothering it okay well come on back then to first Timothy for just a minute and we'll finish this up
[time=2929] he must be one who manages his own household well vers 4 keeping his children under control with all dignity
[time=2937] now I want to talk about that word dignity for a minute because I think it continues to open our eyes to the leadership that men give both in the home and in the church
[time=2946] the word dignity talks about respect and it means that if you're a person of dignity not in the world's way of thinking of it
[time=2954] but in this sense in the biblical sense if you're a person of dignity you're respected by other people other people respect you because of who you are
[time=2962] it's not that you demand it from them it's just they look at you they look at your life and they go I respect that person so it is an intrinsic thing it comes from within the child looking at their father and they say I respect that man
[time=2976] that's the kind of leadership that is given this is not a spirit crushing tyrant who gains submission by harsh punishment or unjust oppression
[time=2985] he leads or manages his household in an honorable respectable and dignified way
[time=2991] the Bible implores fathers not to provoke or to exasperate their children over and over you'll hear that as a theme in the Old Testament and the New Testament
[time=2998] don't exasperate your child and I think what that means is don't treat your child in such a way that you don't understand the bent of that child and the nature of that child
[time=3006] and the unique personality and you just come crushing through the door with your list of demands and the way it's going to be
[time=3012] and you exasperate the child you push it completely out of what it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to be trained and raised
[time=3019] and it takes skill not to exasperate and yet still call the holiness it takes intimate involvement and knowledge and you oftentimes don't know what to do
[time=3031] had a situation like that just recently even last couple of weeks in our household and one of our daughters
[time=3037] I just felt like we weren't you know we weren't connecting we weren't my leadership wasn't being received
[time=3046] as it had been in the past and it was a very emotional thing and there were lots of tears in her eyes and anger coming out
[time=3055] and unusual ways, extra ways and they'd been going on too long and we found ourselves up in her bedroom and she's on her bed there and I'm kind of sitting with her and I said
[time=3067] could I ask you some questions how are you experiencing me how are you feeling about me right now in other words
[time=3076] how am I doing now I'm not looking for her to affirm my leadership but I want some honest feedback
[time=3082] could you tell me what I feel like to you right now and she gave me some honest feedback and it wasn't all real good I mean she had some good points where I wasn't cutting it and I acknowledged those and asked her to forgive me for those
[time=3096] and I said now in light of this situation how do you want to how should we work together me as dad and my role you as daughter and your role how are we going to work our way through this situation
[time=3107] and a hundred others that are coming just like it and we chatted together and I tried to
[time=3113] try to be open in my heart and learn and listen by time we're done I had tears in my eyes and she had tears in her eyes
[time=3119] and we were hugging and at least we felt both together that our relationship was back together and I'm sure we're going to butt heads again you know we're both sinful human beings
[time=3130] but there's a respect I hope I hope that there is a relationship of respect that can come from that
[time=3137] and I share those things with you only to say that I resist the notion of people being up front
[time=3143] here and everything is glitter you know everything is great everything isn't always great and there are real struggles and trials and we walk through those together but it is not a spirit crushing tyrant
[time=3156] in a book that Stephen Covey wrote allow me to read except excerpt that I think is the opposite of dignity
[time=3170] he says this suppose for example that whenever my children begin to do something I feel is inappropriate
[time=3176] I sense an immediate tensing in the pit of my stomach I feel defensive walls go up I prepare for battle
[time=3184] my focus is not on the long term growth and understanding but on the short term behavior I'm trying to win the battle not the war I pull out my ammunition my superior size my position of authority
[time=3196] and I yell or intimidate or threaten or punish and I win I stand there victorious in the middle of the debris
[time=3203] of a shattered relationship while my children are outwardly submissive and inwardly rebellious suppressing feelings that will come out later in uglier ways
[time=3214] man that sounds familiar he's been watching me you know
[time=3220] there are times when you come home and you're tired and you're frustrated and the situation has gone on too long and you just want relief and so there's that harsh demanding, unthoughtful, unloving, misuse of authority size
[time=3232] and position and he calls his readers then to close their eyes and to envision themselves at a funeral
[time=3246] and to see the funeral home and to walk inside the door and to look there at the front at the casket
[time=3253] and it's open and there's somebody in there and then as it goes on people start coming in and he knows all these people
[time=3260] there's his wife there's his kids his mom and dad relatives friends from the church people from work
[time=3268] goes up there and looks in the casket and it's him it's his own face it's his funeral he's come to his own funeral
[time=3280] so he sits back down it's time now to pay respect and one of his children get up and talk about dad
[time=3293] he says this now if I were sitting at the funeral we visualized and one of my children was about to speak
[time=3300] I would want his life to represent the victory of teaching, of training and disciplining with love
[time=3307] over a period of years rather than the battle scars of quick fix skirmishes
[time=3314] I would want his heart and mind to be filled with the pleasant memories of deep meaningful times together
[time=3320] I would want him to remember the times he came to me with his problems and concerns I would want to have listened and loved and helped I would want him to know I wasn't perfect but that I had tried with everything I had
[time=3335] and that perhaps more than anybody in the world I loved him the reason I would want those things is because deep down I value my children I love them
[time=3348] I want to help them and I value my role as their father and that's good
[time=3355] that's good maybe as we prepare here to depart you fathers would find a quiet place in your house before the day is over and envision that same experience in your life and if it were your funeral today
[time=3372] what would they honestly say?
[time=3375] what would your...
