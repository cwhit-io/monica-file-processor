[time=0] So we come back this morning to our study of elders and we find that they are to be above reproach. Why? Because in order to have a good reputation with those
[time=11] outside the church so that they may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. The devil is noted twice in this passage and I believe he makes a concerted attack upon the leadership of the church. Eldership men who are in this leadership position must stand strong against the schemes of the devil.
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour an hour of Bible study music and fellowship which we
[time=46] hope you find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today Pastor
[time=52] Moore is returning to his series from First Timothy where we have been studying the characteristics of church leadership. Our text requires that those who are considered for the position of elder are to be above reproach and to have a good reputation outside the church. But it also speaks of the actions of the devil to thwart the testimony of those who would be leaders. Just how does the devil attempt his work and how are we as leaders to respond to his temptations and snares? We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to First Timothy
[time=84] chapter 3. Our special music today includes a challenging number from our sanctuary choir entitled "Lift high the Lord our banner" and just before the
[time=96] message, Johnny King will be singing "Peace be still." As we prepare for our
[time=102] time of Bible study, let's begin our time of worship and meditation as celebration answers the question of whether God saved us after we got our life straightened out or was it before?
[time=136] My Lord, for the grove and desire to be holy He has called me his friend He has made me his
[time=151] heir. In my heart I resolve to be worthy.
[time=159] But as I sell a great, this living fruit of faith May I never lose a simple truth of
[time=173] grace. It wasn't after I was worthy that he saved me. We never have to seek his
[time=188] grace as a reward. It wasn't after I obeyed him that he loved me.
[time=203] It wasn't after I had saved him. It wasn't before.
[time=217] We are hearts we renew in the gift of God's love. Giving things that we don't have to
[time=234] earn it. It comes free like the rain that refreshes me. Just as free of
[time=247] that is returning. The deeds we dream of, the ones we were in pain. He's our gift.
[time=263] Not way to solve his grace. It wasn't after I was worthy that he saved me.
[time=276] We never have to seek his grace as a reward. It wasn't after I obeyed him that he loved
[time=292] me. It wasn't after I had saved him. It wasn't after I was worthy.
[time=320] It wasn't after I obeyed him that he loved me. It wasn't after I had saved him.
[time=340] It wasn't after I had saved him. It wasn't after I was worthy that he loved me.
[time=362] It wasn't after I had saved him. It wasn't after I had saved him.
[time=376] [APPLAUSE]
[time=401] [MUSIC - 188 seconds]
[time=599] It's a pleasure to welcome you again to the Bible Hour. We've had a change of weather and rustle this is typical of March in Indiana, one day quite mild and the next day snow coming down.
[time=615] It put a little bit of a damper literally on our groundbreaking ceremonies for this day.
[time=621] That's right, I guess we've canceled it for today. I don't know that it would be wise. The snow seems so wet to stand out there. I think it'd be best to wait to have our groundbreaking ceremonies. We can see the ground we're breaking.
[time=633] For those of you that aren't unaware of our plans for a building, we plan to build 10 classrooms in a gymnasium just to the east of our present building.
[time=642] That will be an opportunity for us to expand in our Sunday school ministries as well as the Christian school. We're excited about that and we'll be telling you about the development of the construction as it goes along.
[time=654] I also want to tell you that if you're watching in the Fort Wayne area that tonight we're having David Musselman here, a pianist, an outstanding pianist, evangelist.
[time=663] It'll be giving a mini concert here before our pastor speaks at 6 p.m. in our evening service right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=672] And then looking ahead, Russell, we've had a good Friday service for a number of years now at the Grand Wayne Center downtown. It's been very effective because it seems to be a little closer to our people.
[time=684] Well, I'm looking forward to that. I guess it gives an opportunity right there on Good Friday to invite friends from the office as we hold the service in the downtown area to come by and share a little bit of music and a preaching of the word and it may give a tremendous opportunity for you to invite a friend that doesn't know Christ and share the message of the resurrection with them on that in this season.
[time=706] And that service is at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne on Friday, April 17th. And the time is 1215 to 1245, just a short half hour of inspiration at the Grand Wayne Center in downtown Fort Wayne.
[time=721] I hope that you'll come and join with us for that wonderful service. Also looking ahead on April 18th and 19th, we'll have a drama presentation here entitled Spark in Judea.
[time=733] The program will be on Saturday night at 7 p.m., April 18th. And then it repeated again on Sunday night, April 19th at 6 p.m.
[time=742] Tickets are available. They're free. You can call the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 493-7400 and receive free tickets. Just let us know and you can pick them up.
[time=754] We hope that you'll join with us for this magnificent presentation of the Easter program. Join with us for that special time.
[time=763] Now just before we go back to our service, I want to tell you again about this booklet entitled God's promises for your every need.
[time=770] These are scriptures categorized into various topics such as worry and stress and a very, very important booklet for you to help you to encourage you in your spiritual walk, perhaps to help a neighbor or a friend that you work with that will give encouragement through the Word of God.
[time=787] I'll touch you right for it today. You can receive it free by writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=808] We go back to the live portion of our service now looking forward to the ministry of music from Joni King and then the message from our pastor, Teacher Russell Moore. I hope that you'll stay tuned for the remainder of the Bible Hour.
[time=839] [MUSIC - 205 seconds]
[time=1066] Thank you, Joni. We so appreciate your life and ministry and your husband Ron and little Nathan. What a joy.
[time=1078] Well, if you'll take your Bibles this morning and open to 1 Timothy chapter 3, we have the privilege of returning to our study of God's Word. We're moving through this book, chapter by chapter, paragraph by paragraph, verse by verse in search of God's truth for our lives and for this church.
[time=1098] It's seven verses, chapter three, verses one through seven, all about the qualifications for leadership or for elders. And I can barely turn to this passage without the vivid memory of the look on Tim Jack's face one Sunday afternoon about four o'clock.
[time=1115] I was on staff at a large church. There were about 30 pastors on staff. And I was working with the junior high ministry at that time. We were returning that Sunday afternoon from a junior high camp.
[time=1126] Several busloads of kids and we had a great time together and we were ranting and raving and hollering as you do and junior high and having the time of our lives.
[time=1136] Stepped off the bus and there was Tim Jack, the man who ran the youth department, the pastor that I reported to and the look on his face was as if his child or his wife had just died.
[time=1146] Something desperate had happened in his life and so he took me by the arm and removed me to a quiet place and said Paul has disqualified himself.
[time=1156] Paul was the senior associate pastor on staff. He was the assistant to the senior pastor and gave the chief of staff responsibilities to the rest of us.
[time=1168] He was a man of tremendous gift and power and influence in the work of God at that place. He was also discipling me personally at the time and the news struck my heart as if it had been pierced with a spear.
[time=1182] That very afternoon at 5 o'clock a special elders meeting convened to discuss the situation and really to weep and to mourn the loss of this man from the leadership team.
[time=1194] Through his involvement with his secretary he had proved himself not to be a one woman man and had disqualified himself from ministry.
[time=1204] The next time I remember somebody being disqualified from eldership was at a staff meeting at the same church several years later it was Tuesday morning and as was our custom we met and sat in a rectangle around some tables that had been set up to study the word of God and to pray.
[time=1222] We were moving through this very passage and had been doing so for weeks as we were carefully examining the truth of God and trying to apply it to our own lives and we were at verse 4 that particular Tuesday.
[time=1234] He must be one who manages his own household well keeping his children under control with all dignity.
[time=1240] I remember the man raising his head from the Bible with tears in his eyes saying I have been under conviction by the spirit of God now for weeks.
[time=1250] I have been in close contact with several of the other pastors on staff and they confer and agree with my situation.
[time=1258] I am not managing my household well my children are not in particular his son was not under control with all dignity he had been angry and antagonistic against the Christian faith and there was serious question in our minds as to whether or not he was even truly saved.
[time=1274] It was on that day that we lost yet another man from the leadership team of the church. God is serious about men being spiritually qualified to lead the church because God is serious about the mission of the church.
[time=1290] God has been laboring for centuries in this phenomenon the organism the body of Christ the bride of Christ the church which is more than buildings more even than people it is energized by the spirit of God and its mission is to reach the lost for Christ and when they come to Christ then to train them up into maturity so that they can turn around and win another for Christ.
[time=1311] This is the passion of God's heart this is the theme of the centuries and he has set a certain order and a certain structure for the church in order for it to be successful in its mission.
[time=1323] We find in chapter 3 verse 15 that Paul is noting some of that structure in case I am delayed I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself and the household of God which is the church of the living God the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=1339] A large portion of the instruction as to the internal order and organization of the church of God is given in these verses. You remember it began in chapter 2 as we were instructed at each meeting to offer in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanks giving on behalf of all men calling us back to our mission statement as a church to win the nations of the world with the gospel of Christ.
[time=1365] He took up that in verses 9 through 15 in chapter 2 the role of women in the church that they are to be learners they are to be discipled and they have a vital role in the church but it is not the role of teaching or exercising authority over a man that has been given to the men of the church and so in chapter 3 he begins a lengthy discussion of what these men are to be how they are to be qualified and what their function is inside the church.
[time=1393] And so of these nearly 20 qualifications that are listed for us referencing the elder in verses 1 through 7 in chapter 3 we come this morning to the last 2 1 in verse 6 and 1 in verse 7 allow me to read that those 2 verses if you will.
[time=1409] Verse 6 not a new convert lest he become conceded and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil then verse 7 he must have a good reputation with those outside the church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=1425] What does it mean he must not be a new convert not a new convert lest he become conceded and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
[time=1436] Well if the word new convert were literally translated from the Greek it would be neo fight literally newly planted either a plant or a tree that has just been planted it is as in the case of a tree a sapling very young.
[time=1451] And it should not be planted among the great Sequoias if you will it should not be planted among the grove of great and mature trees figuratively it is a new convert or a novice.
[time=1463] And though this little sapling of a human being may have all of the makings of a great Sequoia of a great tree of significant stature and strength and nobility he may even at this time have the elements of being a one woman man he may at this time be respectable and hospitable and able to teach but if he is a new convert he's not qualified.
[time=1484] He's too fresh he's too new he is yet still a novice you say why why is that disqualifying him well look again at verse six lest he become conceded and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
[time=1498] The word for conceded there is an interesting word it means both to be puffed up by smoke and to be enveloped by the smoke to be be clouded.
[time=1507] It's like trying to navigate the street when you need to put the defogger on inside your car because the windshield is full of fog and the side windows are fogged and the back window is fogged and you're supposed to drive somewhere but you can't see anything.
[time=1521] When you take a young man a young man who may have great promise for the kingdom and who has a heart for God and even aspires to leadership as he should but you place him in the position of leadership too soon he can become conceded puffed up and clouded in his vision and will not be able to see and no longer will be able to negotiate his own life much less the life of the church.
[time=1544] The condemnation referred to here is not the condemnation that the devil will bring on the new convert this is the condemnation that God has already brought on the devil.
[time=1553] The Bible know where represents the devil as a judge who condemns people God is the judge and it is God's judgment of Satan that is in view here.
[time=1562] The judgment that was meted out to Satan may be meted out to the novice as well and what is that a demotion a demotion from a high position because of pride.
[time=1574] Come with me if you will to the book of Ezekiel in the Old Testament Ezekiel chapter 28 and you'll see this description of how this occurred.
[time=1585] Ezekiel it goes Isaiah Jeremiah lamentations Ezekiel Daniel Hosea one of the major prophets Ezekiel chapter 28 verses 11 and following.
[time=1598] The person really first in view in this passage is the king of tire a human person but you and I know that behind the human powers are the demonic powers, the principalities, the dominions of this world that are orchestrated by Satan.
[time=1614] Ephesians chapter 6 and so often what will happen is the biblical writer will begin to describe a human king but as the narrative develops it's obvious there are supernatural characteristics being attributed to this human king and so we go beyond the king to the demonic power in this case Satan behind the king.
[time=1631] Verse 11 and the word of the Lord came to me saying son of man take up a lamentation over the king of tire and say to him thus says the Lord God.
[time=1641] You had the seal of perfection full of wisdom and perfect in beauty you were in Eden the garden of God every precious stone was your covering the ruby the topaz the diamond the barrel the anx the jasper the lapis lazuli the turquoise the emerald the gold the workmanship of your settings and sockets was in you on the day you were created they were prepared.
[time=1667] You were the anointed cherub who covers and I placed you there you were on the holy mountain of God and you walked in the midst of the stones of fire you were blameless in your ways from the day you were created.
[time=1682] Now of course we know the angels were created sometime before creation itself as recorded in Genesis chapter 1 verse 15 until unrighteousness was found in you by the abundance of your trade you were internally filled with violence and you sinned therefore I have cast you as profane from the mountain of God and I have destroyed you o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire.
[time=1710] Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your splendor I cast you to the ground I put you before kings that they may see you.
[time=1724] Satan became proud Satan was the apparently the most beautiful of all the created angelic being he held the highest position in the highest honor as far as we can tell marvelously gifted by God for service in the kingdom of God but it went to his head he was be clouded he lost his ability to perceive his proper state underneath the sovereign God and another.
[time=1753] Illusion to his heart and mind I'll read it to you from Isaiah 14. This is Satan speaking we believe but you said in your heart I will ascend to heaven I will raise my throne above the stars of God and I will sit on the mount of assembly and the recesses of the north I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will make myself like the most high.
[time=1777] He totally lost perspective he forgot that he was a created being he forgot that he was on the mountain of God because God himself had placed in there he forgot that what he had to offer to the kingdom of God was first a gift from God that could be then given back to God.
[time=1793] And so God demoted him God demoted him to eternal judgment which is still awaiting him revelation tells us that he will be thrown into the lake of fire where he will burn forever and ever that burning also will be a conscious torment.
[time=1809] Now in elder though promoted too early and falling into pride he too can be demoted from his high position but never into judgment as will be incurred by Satan for he is a believer he is saved and he won't come into the eternal judgment but he can receive a kind of judgment one that is similar to that of the devil that of being demoted from a position of high leadership and visibility and influence in the kingdom of God and God can do that in a million different ways.
[time=1838] He can break an elder through physical sickness and take him down that way and put him on a bed of sickness he can ruin the man's life in a number of different ways just as his own pride works its way out inside the family of the redeemed and he loses respect of the people because he is arrogant and cocky and proud and is no longer viewed as really acting in the benefit of the people but in his own benefit.
[time=1864] He can break his bones he can dry up his ministry so that there is no fruit there is no power of God being evidence there and everything begins to fall apart and he finally finds himself in a pit of despair God humbles those who are proud.
[time=1884] What Paul is saying here is that the man godly as he may be at this point in his life aspiring to leadership as he might be and rightly so needs time.
[time=1894] He needs time he needs to learn a few things he needs to learn a few things about his doctrine that it's not as clear as he thinks it is that it's not as black and white in every category as he might have assumed just fresh out of seminary.
[time=1906] He also needs to learn a thing or two about his people. He needs to reach a point of at times total frustration as he finds that people more complex than he thought a little more stubborn than he anticipated and really very disappointing.
[time=1919] He needs to reach a place where he is desiring to turn to the Psalms and pray down some imprecatory Psalms upon the people but then at the same time find that it's his people that are the greatest joy and the greatest resource and the greatest sense of satisfaction he'll ever have in his entire life.
[time=1933] He needs to learn a thing or two about himself. He needs to walk through his failures and return back the Romans chapter 7 with the Apostle Paul and cry out, "Oh, wretched man that I am who will deliver me from the body of this death. Why do I sin again and again and again and struggle in the same areas? I hate it. I want no more of it."
[time=1952] At the same time rejoice in the reality of Philippians 1-6 whereby God says it's I who have started this work in you and I will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ and so that man seeing his failures and his inadequacies and his sinfulness can at the same time see the love of God and the power of the grace of God to move him towards Christ's likeness despite himself.
[time=1972] He needs time to learn a thing or two about his God that God is not his own personal private genie whose bottle he rubs three times once for prayer, once for obedience and once for Bible study.
[time=1983] God then materializes in front of him asks him what he wants. He presents his request and God immediately grants it.
[time=1990] Instead God is a mysterious God, God is a holy God, a righteous God, a God who sometimes doesn't seem to hear the prayer, a God who is patient in his dealings and sometimes takes a long time longer than he would want.
[time=2004] A God of discipline and still a God of grace.
[time=2010] Even Timothy himself, by this time at the writing of this book we believe to be 40 years of age, probably has been saved about 12 years, but look at chapter 4 verse 12.
[time=2022] First Timothy chapter 4 verse 12, he is called here, said, "Let no one look down on your youthfulness, let no one look down on your youthfulness but rather in speech conduct, love, faith and purity show you an example.
[time=2037] Show yourself an example of those who believe. At 40 years old saved over a decade, yet still his youthfulness is an issue in the church. He needs time, he needs to grow, he needs to mature.
[time=2049] He needs to find the balance in his Christian life.
[time=2054] Let me give you three reasons why you don't want proud people in leadership, whether they're young or old in the faith.
[time=2060] The first is because of God's attitude towards the proud. God's attitude towards the proud. God opposes the proud. James chapter 4, God is opposed to the proud.
[time=2070] It means he is in a face-to-face conflict with people who are proud. If you don't think so, just ask King Nebuchadnezzar, one of the most gifted leaders who's ever lived or walked on the face of the earth.
[time=2083] A man naturally gifted and then given the marvelous grace by God to raise up an incredible kingdom.
[time=2090] But there was a day in his heart when he became proud, the king reflected and said, "Is this not Babylon, the great which I myself have built as a royal residence by the might of my power and for the glory of my majesty?"
[time=2106] While the word was in the King's mouth, a voice came from heaven saying, "King Nebuchadnezzar to you it is declared, sovereignty has been removed from you, and you will be driven away from mankind and your dwelling place will be with the beasts of the field.
[time=2118] You will be given grass to eat like cattle and seven periods of time will pass over you until you recognize that the most high is ruler over the realm of mankind and bestows it on whomever he wishes."
[time=2131] Immediately the word concerning Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled and he was driven away from mankind and began eating grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair had grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws.
[time=2145] He spent seven years in the field eating grass like an animal, this is King Nebuchadnezzar, he ruled the known world.
[time=2154] Until he could finally once again confess that God is sovereign and God humbled him, sending him into the field.
[time=2164] Isaiah 13 says it this way, "I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud and a base, the hotness of the ruthless."
[time=2175] But Isaiah 66 says this, "To the one, to this one, I will look to him who is humble and contrite of spirit and who trembles at my word."
[time=2185] You see James 4 also says that while God is opposed to the proud he gives grace to the what? To the humble? That's who you want leading your church.
[time=2194] You want men who are besieging God for the grace to lead, men who are very aware of their inadequacies and their sin and the limitedness, nature of their giftedness and their own personal abilities, and still they fall before the throne of God because the work of God must go on and say in spite of me, in spite of who I am, in spite of my limitations, God please give grace.
[time=2214] Please allow the work to go forward. Please allow us to have success.
[time=2221] That's the heart of a leader who is humble before God.
[time=2226] The second reason you don't want proud people in leadership is because the proud don't receive the word of God.
[time=2231] The proud don't receive the word of God. They have their own view. They have their own perspective and they're going to go their own way.
[time=2238] Moses, despite the word of God, chose to strike the rock twice instead of once as he was told and he never saw the promise land.
[time=2247] These men we've studied in the book of 1 Timothy, these elders who are rising in the leadership are not responsive to the word of God because they're proud and they're arrogant.
[time=2256] And instead of teaching the word they pay attention to myths and endless genealogies which give rise to mere speculation rather than furthering the administration of God.
[time=2266] They stand in bold contrast to the young King Josiah who had not seen the word of God because it had been hidden by previous generations.
[time=2274] And ascending now to the throne, he found the word of God and it was read to him and when he realized how devastating his life was in light of the word of God,
[time=2283] how far removed he was from the standard of God and how far removed his own nation had moved from the word of God, he fell on the floor, he tore his clothes and he repented in the presence of God.
[time=2294] He was a humble man and when he heard the word of God, he looked at his own life and fell prostrate before God.
[time=2299] And frankly, that's what everybody's response should be to the word of God.
[time=2302] Everybody's response should be just that way.
[time=2305] When you or I are under the word of God and the teaching is being brought or the studying in your personal private devotion and you find that you are falling short of the divine standard on a daily basis,
[time=2316] there should be a deep conviction of sinfulness and your own pride and your own sense of independence and you should weep in your heart that God should grant forgiveness, that you could be humbled before him and walk another day on the planet.
[time=2331] Oh, that the word of God would come to the Senate of this nation or the House of Representatives or the Supreme Court, and there they would take as much time as they needed to read the entire council, both old and New Testament and when they are finished, be so overwhelmed by their own sinfulness and the sinfulness of this nation that they would fall flat on the floor and rip their suits and cry for the mercy of God first for their own souls and salvation and then for this nation.
[time=2360] You know why they don't do that because they're proud? That's why they don't do that and that's why you and I don't do that because we're proud.
[time=2369] The word of God should brand our souls, but we are arrogant.
[time=2375] And when that arrogance finds its way as a habitual characteristic pattern into the leadership of the church, it is the end of the church. God will be done with that church.
[time=2386] The third reason that you don't want leadership in proud leadership leading your church is because it reveals they've forgotten their past.
[time=2395] They've forgotten their past. First Corinthians 4.7 and what do you have that you did not receive? But if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?
[time=2408] Whether it's your salvation or your ability to generate an income or the size of your bank account or some unique talent that God has given you or even a spiritual giftedness or your appearance, whatever it is, whatever it is that you have, it has come from God.
[time=2424] You do not have it, save the fact that He gave it to you and you say, "No, wait a minute. I've taken some of these talents and some of these opportunities and I've really worked hard and I've built this empire because of the sweat of my own brow."
[time=2438] I would remind you of the words of King Nebuchadnezzar who was also very gifted at birth and did work very hard and very skillfully, but the minute he took credit for it, the minute that he said that what he had produced was for his own splendor and for his own glory and by his own might, God humbled him.
[time=2453] 1 Corinthians 3, 7, "So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything. You and I are the ones who are out there trying to water and out there planting, but we amount to nothing."
[time=2468] Why? Because it is God who causes the growth.
[time=2472] Ask a farmer who time and time again, season after season does his very best to cultivate the field, to plant, and to water, but he knows that the produce of that field, the fruitfulness, is not of his own making.
[time=2484] It would be of God who makes it a fruitful year or not a fruitful year.
[time=2491] 1 Corinthians 15, 10, "But by the grace of God, I am what I am. But by the grace of God, I am what I am. But by the grace of God, I just took that last breath. My heart just beat again."
[time=2510] 1 man compared it to the use of an axe. The axe cannot boast of the trees, it is cut down. It could do nothing but for the woodsman. The woodsman made it, the woodsman sharpened it, and the woodsman used it.
[time=2524] The moment he throws it aside, it becomes only old iron. Oh, that I may never lose sight of this.
[time=2534] You, or me, as we are thrown aside and dropped from the hand of God, we become like an old axe that is worth absolutely nothing. Our only utility, our only value comes in the fact that God takes a hold of our life and chooses to use it for the cause of Christ.
[time=2550] You know the older Paul got the more he realized that. There is a distinct progression of thought and understanding of his unworthiness before God as he moves through his ministry.
[time=2560] One of the earliest books he wrote was 1 Corinthians, and in chapter 15 verse 9 he says this, "For I am the least of all the apostles who have not fit to be called an apostle." Early in his ministry he is saying, "Wait a minute, I don't even belong in this thing called the Apostleship. I am the least of these guys."
[time=2577] Midway in his ministry he wrote the book of Ephesians, and in Ephesians 3.80 he says this, "To me the very least of all the saints." Now he understands because he is a little older in the Lord that he is the least of all the saints, not just the apostles but the company of the Redeem.
[time=2596] As he nears his death as he has in this book, 1 Timothy, this is one of the last books that he wrote. You remember what he said in chapter 1 verse 15, "That Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners among whom I am what?"
[time=2612] I began early in my ministry by realizing I don't fit with these guys, these apostles, but then as I grew I am realizing, "Man, I am the least of all these saints."
[time=2626] And now I am ready to die, and I have learned another thing about myself, I am the chief of sinners.
[time=2632] That would be a characteristic mark of mature leadership, the older they get, the more aware they are of their unworthiness, their sinfulness, and their utter dependence upon the grace of God to do anything of value.
[time=2645] You say, "I am proud," and I say, "Me too." I welcome to the crowd. We struggle with pride, don't we? We are human beings and we are stuck in the flesh, and we want often to give ourselves credit.
[time=2657] But let me offer two suggestions to deal with pride, and that's kind of a funny thing, isn't it?
[time=2664] The second you think you're not proud, then you're proud again.
[time=2668] But step one, my suggestion to you is to pray, to pray that God will show you your sin.
[time=2675] There is such a capacity inside of us to evaluate ourselves as less sinful than we really are.
[time=2681] To take a look at the events of our lives, the relationships, the way that happened, the way this happened, and give ourselves the benefit of the doubt.
[time=2688] And oftentimes it's very helpful, and that's why I think I like communion so much, because we'll spend 30 to 35 minutes just saying to God,
[time=2695] "I am a sinful person, show me my sin, allow me to confess my sin to you, but it needs to happen more often than just that communion."
[time=2702] If you're feeling proud and hotty and independent, then find a quiet place and pray that the God of heaven would be so gracious as to show you your sin.
[time=2710] And then when he does it, admit it to someone you know and love.
[time=2714] Find a person in your life, a dear friend that you can just honestly share with what God has shown you about yourself.
[time=2720] It's very healthy.
[time=2722] Several weeks ago, Tim, Teter and I were driving home from Indianapolis. We'd been visiting Greg and the Hindals, and we were making our way back to the church here.
[time=2732] And well, it was about three and a half hours before we figured out we weren't on 69 at all. We'd headed north on 65.
[time=2740] And we were, what, 20 minutes outside of Chicago, so we went on into the town, had a great dinner.
[time=2747] That's true, folks. That happened. And I like to think the reason that we weren't paying very much attention to the scenery was because we were involved in a really significant conversation.
[time=2763] And we just started asking each other questions about our coming to Christ and about our families and about our wives and about our struggles and about our hurts.
[time=2770] And we ended up talking about some things. I shared some things with him. I'd never shared with any living human being before about my sinfulness.
[time=2778] And I just felt compelled because I trusted him to admit to him a level of my depravity.
[time=2786] And at the same time, it was two things, humbling and very relieving.
[time=2792] I don't think you do that with everybody. I don't think you do that all the time.
[time=2796] But I think there are people in your life when God is gracious to show you your sin that you venture out in vulnerability and admit it.
[time=2806] Secondly, in pursuing some level of humility in your life, obey and honor the authority in your life.
[time=2815] Obey and honor the authority in your life. Whether it's at work, whether it's the government, whether it's the police, whether it's a parent, but ultimately the Word of God.
[time=2827] The Word of God humble yourself before it. Obey it. Honor it. Keep it.
[time=2834] And if that's not your practice, and when you hear the Word of God in private devotion or from the pulpit and you say, "Nah, not for me."
[time=2844] You're proud. And God will humble you.
[time=2851] So, elders, qualified one, not by being a new convert, lest he become conceded and fall into the condemnation incurred by the devil.
[time=2859] And then secondly, he must have a good reputation with those outside the church so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=2869] Outside the church is just another word for unbelievers. And you say, "You mean to tell me that the unbelievers, people who don't know Christ, people who aren't indwelt by the Spirit of God, people to whom the Word of God makes no sense are the ones who are going to be developing the criteria for the leadership of your church?" Yes. Why?
[time=2890] Because oftentimes it's the unbeliever who knows your character better than the rest of us. It's the unbeliever that you work with. It's the unbeliever that's outside the church that watches you into the pressure of life's demands and the decisions that have to be made and the way that your money gets spent and the way you got the promotion or you didn't get the promotion and the way you respond to that and the tough decisions that have to be made that test your character.
[time=2913] Oftentimes it's the unbeliever who can make a better statement about the real quality of your character than those of us who see you mainly on Sunday or on Wednesday around the church.
[time=2926] The second reason I think it's so critical that the reputation be strong with unbelievers is that's the whole mission of the church. That's why we exist. We exist to bring the unbeliever to Christ and if our own leaders don't have a godly reputation of great character in the eyes of the unbelieving, how are we going to lead them to Christ? Why do I want to be like you guys? I know elders so and so and he did such and such.
[time=2951] So the question is what is your mechanic think about you? If we were going to qualify you for leadership and we would find the one who works on your car, what is his testimony of your character and the one who checks you out at the grocery store?
[time=2966] What is her or his opinion of you? Let's talk to the banker and find out if your unsaved banker recommends you to be an elder of this church.
[time=2974] And what about the one who checks you out at the video store? If we were to go there and say based upon the videos being requested here, does this man qualify for church leadership?
[time=2988] And obviously what would the work associates say? The people at Magnavox and GTE and all the other places of employment in this city?
[time=3000] An elder must have a reputation for integrity and love and kindness and generosity and goodness among the unredeemed community.
[time=3008] Now there will be times of antagonism just because of his character. There will be times because he stands for Christ, because he is godly, because he won't compromise,
[time=3017] because he stands strong for the morality of the Bible that there will be an antagonistic report about him and against him.
[time=3024] But it's not for lack of character. It's because of his character.
[time=3028] One such man that is on the national scene even today is Bob Vernon, assistant police chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.
[time=3036] He is being attacked by some of the most ungodly, humanistic, liberal people on the planet because they can't stand his character.
[time=3045] He is like a bright and shining light that exposes the deeds of their darkness, and I believe if they had the chance they would take him to a hill and crucify him as they took our Lord because they are so angered by his righteousness.
[time=3060] So there are times when the believer is not given a good report by the unbeliever, but it is because of his godly character.
[time=3068] And there he is even greater qualified to be an elder. I'm excited about Bob Vernon. He's agreed to come and be a part of a men's retreat with us in April of 93, and that will be a great day for our church.
[time=3081] He'll come and speak to us on Sunday morning, and we will have opportunity to share in the character of that man and what god has been doing in his life.
[time=3092] Now as we conclude, please note, in verses 6 and 7, the devil has mentioned twice. The devil has mentioned in the end of verse 6, and then in the end of verse 7, so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
[time=3105] The snare of the devil. Satan is often pictured as a very cunning and skillful hunter, and this word is that of a trap that you would set to catch an animal, or in this case spiritually to catch a leader because Satan wants to bring them into reproach,
[time=3119] into disgracing the church, and the name of Christ. And there is no one better qualified to bring reproach upon the name of Christ than an elder, than someone who has stood in the assembly and proclaimed allegiance to the cause of Christ, and has a public knowledge or has an exposure to the public that is wide and far reaching.
[time=3141] I was in China just weeks after the Jim and Tammy Faye Baker thing broke here in America, and the communists who lead China and who hate Christ and who hate Christianity and who hate the word of God had gathered all of the information from the news media of the United States of America and had spread it all across China because they wanted to disgrace and discredit the name of Christ.
[time=3170] And Jim Baker gave them all the ammunition they needed. And we were talking with the leaders of the Church of China, and they were lamenting in their heart the setback that it gives Christianity in China because there was no kind of behavior like that among the Christians of China, not at that level, not in that way.
[time=3196] So it is the leader whose reputation with those outside the church must remain strong for he is the prey of Satan because the devastating impact can be so far reaching when a leader falls.
[time=3211] Well, God is serious about church leadership. God is serious that the men who fill these positions are spiritually qualified. They are ultimately qualified by being above reproach. There's nothing in their life of any significance that can be taken a hold of by those inside the family, the children, outside the church, whereby we can say no, not qualified.
[time=3236] Three broad categories in this passage. The first is the most intimate relationship of all, the husband of one wife, a one woman man, would the wife stand before the assembly if she were asked and say this man is devoted to me.
[time=3252] And if we could look into the inter recesses of his mind, then his heart would we find him consistently and faithfully committed to his wife and the purity of that relationship.
[time=3264] Second area or category would be the relationship in his household and namely those with his children. If we were going to qualify a man, would his children come and stand before the assembly and say, you can count on my dad.
[time=3277] He's a godly man. I see him on vacation. I see him at the end of the month when there isn't enough money to pay the bills. I see him when I've made mistakes. I see him when he's tired. I see him when he loses his temper. He's a godly man.
[time=3291] And he makes mistakes, but he seeks forgiveness and he moves ahead with purpose because he loves people and he loves me. And then lastly, if we were to call in the people from the community and line them up, would they say, I don't so much believe what he believes.
[time=3310] And that don't so much care for everything about him, but there's no questioning his character. He's a godly man. He keeps his word. He pays his bills. He's on time. He submits to authority. He's gracious to me.
[time=3327] These are the men to lead the church. Interesting. And just in a moment's time as we close, would you flip over to Philippians chapter 2? Because it broadens rapidly past the leadership and to all of us, all of we who are in the company of the redeemed.
[time=3344] Philippians chapter 2 verse 15 says this, "That you may prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you appear as lights in the world."
[time=3362] So he takes this above reproach standard and he moves it right past the leadership and then gives it to all of us.
[time=3368] A body of believers who are following men above reproach that we might become people above reproach that the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ may radiate in the community around us.
[time=3380] And that is our great and high calling.
[time=3409] We've been sharing with you today music from our sanctuary choir, celebration, and soloist, Joni King.
[time=3416] The message today was a fifth in the series of messages on leadership from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3423] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3431] Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you today knowing that I'm a sinner and that I've sinned against you.
[time=3438] I ask you to come into my heart today and forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3443] I thank you for doing this and for being my Savior. In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=3451] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3455] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
