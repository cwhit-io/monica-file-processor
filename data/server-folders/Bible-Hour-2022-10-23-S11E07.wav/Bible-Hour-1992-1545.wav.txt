[time=0] Today we come to the subject of being a servant and in our day and age the
[time=6] servant is really a degrading term. It's almost the picture of a human mule that goes about life performing an important task and is rarely noticed. But Jesus elevated the term of servant and equated it with greatness. In fact he said that he himself had come not to be served but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many. You'll never be more like Jesus Christ than when you're serving and when you're giving your life away.
[time=33] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which
[time=48] we hope you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today
[time=54] Pastor Moore will continue his series from First Timothy where we have been studying the characteristics of church leadership. In the last few weeks we have addressed the characteristics of evangelistic crane, the role of women and the characteristics of elders. Today Pastor Russ will be addressing the fourth and final piece of this puzzle, namely the role of the servant in the church.
[time=76] Though it is the last piece it is by no means the least significant. Consider what Christ has to say in Mark 10 verse 43, but whoever who desires to be great among you shall be your servant. We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to First Timothy chapter 3 where we will be studying verses 8 through 13. Our special music today includes an encouraging number from our sanctuary
[time=103] choir and soloist Chris Bohn entitled Friend of a Wounded Heart and just before today's message Denise Mitchell will be singing don't cry for me. As we
[time=113] prepare for our time of Bible study let's begin our time of worship and meditation as rejoice sings the song he loved me.
[time=137] God chose us to be his very own before the creation of the world. He decided
[time=147] then to make us holy in his eyes without a single flaw. We who stand before him
[time=153] covered with his love. His unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into
[time=159] his own family by sending Jesus Christ to die for us and he did this because he
[time=166] Lobs us.
[time=196] He loved me, when hope was taken when he loved me.
[time=208] When I lost everything he bought me.
[time=215] Redemptions were gone, where Jesus Christ was gone.
[time=225] Who shall separate me from the love of God?
[time=240] Shall dreams come tomorrow?
[time=256] In possession the bread of war and the bread of shine, in all these things.
[time=272] The trees are reborn, the trees are reborn, who Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=292] All this I am sure, and neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor these brothers, nor things to go.
[time=317] Your heart, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus.
[time=334] All this I am sure, and neither death nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things to go.
[time=359] Your heart, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus.
[time=377] To Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=407] The Bible says that He was pierced for our transgressions.
[time=427] He was crushed for our iniquities, the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him and by His wounds we are healed.
[time=441] Whatever you've gone through, I know of the mothers that have died of a broken heart.
[time=449] I know of fathers that have died of a broken heart. I know children that are not well because they have a broken heart.
[time=457] And they just can't take it and they give up.
[time=460] Well, I don't really understand this, but I know that every broken heart, Jesus Christ bore that on the cross.
[time=468] He carried every pain that I've ever suffered and that I will ever suffer. Every heartache that you have, He bore it, and will bear for you.
[time=481] No one is afraid of my Jesus.
[time=498] So make them think you're happy, lie, and say the things are fine.
[time=521] And hide that empty longing that you feel.
[time=527] Don't ever show it.
[time=530] Just keep your heart cold, see.
[time=539] Why are the days so lonely?
[time=547] I wonder where, where can the heart go free?
[time=556] And who will draw the tears that no one sees?
[time=562] There must be someone to share your silent dreams.
[time=574] God, like a leaf in the land, looking for a friend, where can turn?
[time=583] Whisper the words of a prayer, and you'll find him there, homes open wide, loving his eyes.
[time=596] Jesus, He needs to be gone.
[time=603] Oh, Jesus, He needs to live in the sun.
[time=611] Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[time=615] Oh, Jesus, the man of the whole day.
[time=625] Job comes like the morning, hope deep as you grow.
[time=641] And peace beyond the ridges of your soul, comes flowing through you for love has made you fall.
[time=659] One flock of leaf in the wind, looking for a friend, where could you turn?
[time=668] Whisper the words of a prayer, and you'll find him there, homes open wide, loving his eyes.
[time=681] Jesus, He needs to live in the sun.
[time=696] Oh, Jesus, He needs to be gone.
[time=711] Oh, Jesus, He needs to live in the sun.
[time=720] Oh, no, no, no, no.
[time=728] Oh, Jesus, the man of the whole day.
[time=743] He needs to live in the sun.
[time=758] Oh, Jesus, He needs to live in the sun.
[time=773] Oh, Jesus, the man of the whole day.
[time=839] We're very glad that you tuned into the Bible Hour today.
[time=843] As we were sitting here just before the taping, I was looking at a number of the volunteers that have come in very early in the morning to produce the Bible Hour.
[time=851] If you're a Founders Club member, you received a letter this week with some testimonies and why these men and women come in early and help us in producing the Bible Hour.
[time=860] We certainly are grateful for all the people that are behind the scenes so that you can see our program each Sunday.
[time=867] Russell, we're trying again to have groundbreaking ceremonies on April 5th.
[time=871] I hope that the weather cooperates with us.
[time=874] Well, I'm learning that March in Indiana is an amazing event.
[time=877] We go from frigid cold snow to some of the most beautiful days and the temperature warms up and the sun comes out.
[time=883] I guess you just don't know what you're going to get from day to day.
[time=886] Just get about enough warmth to get the clubs out and dust them off and then by the time you get them in the trunk of your car, it's snowing or raining.
[time=893] Great, that's right. But it won't be long and we'll get into warmer weather.
[time=897] But if you're watching today on April 5th and you can join us for the groundbreaking ceremonies, it'll be at 12-15 on the east side of our worship center.
[time=905] A great day to break ground for our new classrooms and gymnasium.
[time=911] What a time that will be and what a health that will be in our ministry here at Blackheart.
[time=916] We have some exciting events coming up in the life of our church. The first one is on April 17th on Good Friday.
[time=923] We'll be going down to the Grand Wayne Center as we have in the last number of years and we'll have a service from 12-15 to 12-45.
[time=931] And also we're going to have some music and then a message from God's Word from you and that's a good time.
[time=937] I think it's a centrally located area for our people to get to.
[time=940] I think the exciting thing about that is I want to invite all of you who are viewers of the Bible Hour and might be in the downtown area to stop by and spend that half an hour with us.
[time=950] And we'll be bringing the gospel in that time. So if you'd like to bring an unsafe friend or someone that you've been witnessing to, I think that'll be a tremendous opportunity for us to help you in your evangelistic efforts.
[time=962] Let me just give you that date again. It's on Good Friday, April 17th from 12-15 to 12-45 at the Grand Wayne on the second floor in the ballroom. Come and join with us.
[time=975] And then on April 18th and April 19th we'll have the drama Spark in Judea and by some of the people in our church directed by Leon Pippen.
[time=984] That's a ticketed program, but the tickets are free and you can receive them by calling the church here at 493-7400 or stopping by during the week and we'll be glad to give you tickets.
[time=997] On Saturday night the program will begin at 7 p.m. and on Sunday Easter Sunday evening it will be at 6 p.m. That's April 18th and April 19th.
[time=1008] We'd be glad to have you come and join with us as we re-enact the days before the death of Christ and then his death and his glorious resurrection.
[time=1017] And also speaking of death, we've had a couple deaths recently in our church that have really gotten to our hearts.
[time=1025] We've spent really the spectrum of age, of course Greg Hendel, at 17 years of age diagnosed with leukemia about three years ago.
[time=1035] And for those three years I guess both he and his parents were anticipating the inevitability of death or the very real possibility of that.
[time=1043] He'd even planned his funeral service in advance, which was a wonderful time, a celebration.
[time=1048] And then another lady, really a part of our church, Elizabeth Dick has passed away and that was as sudden and as unexpected as you could imagine.
[time=1059] It kind of reminds us of, I've talked with other people that are in the hospital or whatever, that God doesn't always give us a length of time to get our house in order, that it's very important for us to know our spiritual condition and be prepared before that day of reckoning.
[time=1075] And in the case of Mrs. Dick, that was sudden and she really never regained consciousness.
[time=1080] And I'm reminded that the death of Jesus Christ was also planned.
[time=1084] In fact, you were reading Scripture just before we went on the air.
[time=1088] Yeah, it says here in Acts 2 verse 23, this man, meaning Jesus, delivered up by the predetermined plan and four knowledge of God, you nailed to a cross by the hands of Godless men and put him to death.
[time=1100] But delivered up by the predetermined plan and four knowledge of God.
[time=1106] There certainly is a hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and I think what we want to stress today is really no man knows the hour or even the day when Christ may take him home.
[time=1118] What does she even be if you didn't know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior?
[time=1122] Scripture has a lot to say about that in our gift offer this month. It's called God's promises for every need. There are some categories that speak of the death and resurrection of Christ.
[time=1132] We'd like to have you have this booklet. You can receive it absolutely free if you write to the Bible hour today.
[time=1138] At 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible hour. 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1154] Also, we're going back to the live portion of our service now with some Scripture reading that talks about the hope that we have and Jesus Christ returning to the Father to prepare mansions for those that love him.
[time=1165] I hope that you'll stay tuned for the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=1185] John 14 says, "Let not your heart be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me." In my Father's house are many mansions. If it were not so, I would have told you, "I go to prepare a place for you."
[time=1200] If you loved me, you would rejoice because I said, "I go unto the Father, for my Father is greater than I."
[time=1207] Yet a little while, and the world seeeth me, no more. But you see me because I live. You shall live also.
[time=1225] Here we are again, that old familiar place. Where the wind will blow, no one ever knows the time or space.
[time=1254] Don't cry for me. Don't shed a tear. The time I've shared with you will always be.
[time=1272] And when I'm not still, carry on. Don't cry for me.
[time=1300] No one is the blame, no. My death was meant to be. Don't carry guilt or shame.
[time=1320] The reason why I gave you peace. Don't cry for me. Don't shed a tear. The time I've shared with you will always be.
[time=1345] And when I'm not least, carry on. Don't cry for me.
[time=1364] Don't cry when life is not the joy it should be. When life comes pain.
[time=1380] Soon time will end. It's course appointed. And you will be rewarded for all the world to see. Don't cry for me.
[time=1400] Don't shed a tear. The time I've shared with you will always be.
[time=1412] And when I'm not still, carry on. Don't cry for me.
[time=1428] We'll always be. No cry for me.
[time=1458] Thank you, Denise. Beautiful voice, beautiful song, beautiful truth.
[time=1476] Well, if you have your Bibles this morning, I'll invite you to take them and to turn to the book of First Timothy.
[time=1484] We're studying through the book of First Timothy together and we come this morning to the end of a very important section.
[time=1492] In First Timothy chapter three, we'll study the role of the Deacon in the church. And as you remember, Paul, chapter three verse 15, is writing so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God.
[time=1508] Through the ministry of Paul, at different points in his life, he has given different amounts of information about how to organize and structure the church.
[time=1516] In one of his first letters, the book of First Corinthians and all through that church, there were problems, all through that book, there were problems with the church itself.
[time=1526] But you remember in chapter 12 of First Corinthians, he talked about spiritual gifts and really unveiled for us a level of understanding about the church and being a part of the body of Christ.
[time=1536] He later in his ministry wrote the book of Ephesians, which is even more information for us about the organization and the elements and the purpose and the spiritual dynamics of the New Testament church.
[time=1551] But as he aged and was near his death, he wrote the pastoral epistles, First and Second Timothy and Titus. And in these books gave us an enormous amount further to build on what he had previously given of how to structure and order the church.
[time=1566] And we're in a section about structuring and ordering the church.
[time=1570] The section began in chapter 2, verse 1, and I'll just review this with you briefly so you can see the mind of the Apostle Paul at work.
[time=1579] He began in chapter 2, verse 1, by saying, "First of all, then I urge that in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanks giveings be made on behalf of all men."
[time=1589] He begins by calling the church back to its original purpose, which is the Great Commission. And what he is calling for here is more than just prayer. He's calling that in the hearts of the people there would be a deep burden for the salvation of the people of the world, so deep a burden that every time they meet they are praying for the salvation of lost souls.
[time=1610] He moves on, then, in verse 9, to a new section, a new part of organizing the church in verses 9 to 15. He signals it by the word likewise, "I want women to adorn themselves."
[time=1621] And then he goes on to give instruction as to their adornment and as to their ministry. And while women are to be wonderfully used of God and the church, and they are a vital role in all we do here as Black Hawk Baptist Church, and all that was going on in the church at Ephesus, or should have been going on with them.
[time=1639] They are not to teach. They are not to exercise authority over men. They are not to expound the word of God in the public assembly.
[time=1648] And so he limits them in that way, but he affirms in distinction or contra distinction to the cultural flavor of the day that they are to be disciples, they are to be learners, they are to be taught, they are to be instructed.
[time=1661] And as we move through this book, we'll find other places of ministry positively stated that women will have. But having given the teaching responsibility and the exercising authority through the teaching ministry to the men, he then moves in chapter 3 verse 1 through 7 to describe the qualifications of those men who will be doing that teaching, who will be overseeing the church.
[time=1684] They are called overseers, or elders, or pastors. And those are just three different terms for the same men. Some of them are professionally employed by the church. They receive their income and their way of living from the church itself.
[time=1697] Others of them are overseers, or pastors, or shepherds. And they do not receive their income from the church. They instead make it in the community tent making, if you will, even as you saw in the life of Paul.
[time=1709] But whether or not they're employed by the church, if they're an overseer, they are to be above reproach. There are to be no handles that you can take a hold of in their life where there is substantial violation of the word of God, thereby disqualifying them from leadership.
[time=1724] They saw that those handles are primarily found in the arena of relationships. The first, a husband of one wife, the second that he manages his own household, that his children love, honor, respect, and obey him, and would vote for him for this position of eldership, and then in the community.
[time=1740] That even the unsaved, even the people who don't know Christ, even the people who have maybe never read the Bible, they too play a part in qualifying the leadership of the church.
[time=1749] Because often they know more about this potential or prospective elder than even we who are in the church, for they live in the day to day, and the pressures and the stress of the real live world, and it's their reputation that these unbelievers can speak to.
[time=1763] And then last, but certainly not least comes this ministry of the deacon, and that's picked up in verses 8 through 13.
[time=1771] And when you talk about deacons, you talk about service, deaconos. There really is no English word for the word deacon. We've just coined it from the word deaconos in the Greek, and so we come up with the idea of deacon.
[time=1785] In the verb form it's deacono, and it means to serve. And so as we begin a discussion of deacons, we begin the discussion of being a servant.
[time=1794] And really, as you know, in our day there is little respect for the servant. That is not a title of honor, that is not a title of prestige, or prominence in the community.
[time=1804] In fact, the word servant sometimes pictures, at least in the secular world, a human mule type of a person, or an individual who sort of plows through life, unnoticed, and doing the unimportant tasks.
[time=1819] That, however, is not God's concept of the servant, and that certainly isn't the way Jesus used it. He used the term servant and elevated it by equating it with prue greatness.
[time=1830] Remember He said, "Whoever wishes to become great among you shall become your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all," Mark 10, 43, and 44.
[time=1843] As a result it was Moses, one of the greatest leaders that ever lived, who was called Moses my servant, and the man who followed him Joshua, who led the most successful military campaign in the history of Israel, was also called a servant.
[time=1855] Joshua the servant of Moses, and then of course Jesus himself delighted in referring to himself as a servant.
[time=1862] He said, "The son of man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many."
[time=1870] You can boil the whole life of Jesus Christ down to two things. He came to do just simply two things. He came to serve, and he came to give his life a way.
[time=1879] And you and I will know no greater level of Christ's likeness than when we are serving one another, and when we are sacrificially giving our life a way.
[time=1889] And it was needed in the first century church. It was needed in this church at Ephesus that a group of people would gather together and be noticed and recognized as deacons, as official servants of the church, who would carry on the ministry of the church as it relates to the ongoing day-to-day interaction in people's lives.
[time=1909] I would suggest to you that one of the greatest strengths of this church are the deacons of our church, as they administrate and lead and shepherd and care and serve in our ABS.
[time=1920] One of the greatest joys that I have is to stand up on Sunday mornings and to invite our first time visitors to our ABS, because I know what goes on there.
[time=1928] I know the level of heartfelt servant that our deacons provide, and I would group in that arena of servants, the teachers, and the ministry team leaders that are there as well, and any of the rest of you who may not have a particular title, but you know what you do.
[time=1943] You know you are there to serve, you know you are there to give, and when somebody is sick, the meals come, and when somebody is in financial trouble, the money is raised, and you serve the missionaries on the field by all the various projects that you do, you are the strength of our church.
[time=1957] You are the relational fabric of what we are. That is probably the best part of our church.
[time=1964] And I will say again, if you're a part of our church, but you only come to the worship service, you're missing the best part.
[time=1971] You're missing the very best part, where you could find your way into a group of other Christians, 40 or 50 in number, and you'll find there a love and a care and a concern and a support that you can't find anywhere else in the world.
[time=1985] That would be the serving and the giving of the people in our ABS, and that is spearheaded by our deacons.
[time=1993] Let me read these six verses, and we're going to move rather rapidly through them this morning.
[time=1999] We'll begin in verse 8, "Deacons, likewise, must be men of dignity, not double-tongued or addicted to much wine or fond of sorted gain, but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
[time=2013] And let these also first be tested, then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach."
[time=2019] Verse 11, "Women must likewise be dignified and not malicious gossips, but temperate, faithful in all things, let deacons be husbands of only one wife and good managers of their children and their own households.
[time=2033] For those who have served well as deacons obtained for themselves a high standing and a great confidence in the faith that is in Christ, Jesus."
[time=2043] Now we'll look at these verses this morning, and there will be some overlap with the qualifications for elder and where that's the case I'll just touch and then go on.
[time=2052] It begins in verse 8, "Deacons likewise must be men of dignity, and this is a strong word in the Greek.
[time=2059] The notion of dignity involves two things. One, a strong sense of purpose, and as a result, respectful conduct. They are therefore people of dignity."
[time=2069] Men who have a strong sense that their service, that their ministry behind the scenes, that their ministry, though it not, happen on the platform.
[time=2079] It happens on the telephone as they're caring for people. It happens as they're setting up and taking down certain chairs to provide for the Sunday school group.
[time=2087] It happens in a myriad of ways that few people see, but they understand that that contribution of service is contributing to the greater purpose of this church, and they're tied to that, and so therefore they do it.
[time=2098] And as a result, they're respected. They're held in high honor and rightfully so.
[time=2103] So they are men of dignity. Opposites of this idea of dignity would be frivolous or superficial or shallow or silly.
[time=2115] Instead, they are full of determination, commitment, and stability, and that's why we look to them. That's why we trust them. That's why we nominate and elect them to that position of service.
[time=2127] He goes on then to say that they are full of dignity, and they are not double-tongued. They are not double-tongued.
[time=2137] A deacon will say one thing in this particular setting to these people, and then he'll say the exact same thing to another group that may not feel as favorably about his report.
[time=2147] He isn't a hypocrite. He doesn't adjust his speech to accommodate the company he keeps.
[time=2153] If it's true, he says it. If it happens, that's how it was, and so he stands by his word.
[time=2159] But this word double-tongued, and you may have a different translation of this particular word in your version of the Bible,
[time=2167] but this Greek word is used in the Old Testament, in the Septuagint, the Greek version of the Old Testament. It gives an interesting flavor to it.
[time=2175] Let me read you this verse, Proverbs 11-13, says this, "He who goes about as a tail bearer reveals secrets."
[time=2184] There is a feeling in this word or a nuance to this word of one who can keep confidential matters confidential.
[time=2193] You know, there are very few people who can keep a secret. Have you noticed that? There are very, very few people who can keep a secret.
[time=2200] Why? Well, because when you know something about somebody else, that everybody else doesn't know, that information is power.
[time=2207] You can present yourself as being a very powerful and formed in the know type person as you reveal that.
[time=2214] You can be the one who sees the excitement and the adrenaline rush in the other person's mind and even in their eyes as they hear some little bit of something that they shouldn't have otherwise known.
[time=2224] A servant doesn't do that. A servant isn't taking your confidential information and using it for his own ends.
[time=2230] A servant treasures your material. The thing that you may have shared in confidence with them about a financial struggle or a spiritual struggle or a real problem in the home between the husband and the wife or something that's going on at the place of employment.
[time=2243] A deacon, you can share that with him and you can have absolute confidence that it stops right there. He's not double-tuned.
[time=2254] It goes on. It says there in verse 8 that he is not addicted to much wine and here's one that we've already talked about under elder.
[time=2262] But again, the thrust, he's not under the control of some alien influence. In order to make it through his day, to make it through his life, to make it to the next day, he doesn't have to come home and fire down a couple of drinks to deaden his experience of reality.
[time=2277] Instead, there is dependence upon the Spirit of God to strengthen and to carry through the very sometimes difficult situations in life.
[time=2287] And so whether it's addicted to wine or addicted to money or addicted to some other to being a fighter or a pugnacious as we saw with the elder, there is a freedom from those kinds of addictions and instead there is a dependency upon the Lord and so the servant is dependable and the servant is faithful.
[time=2306] Now the last qualification found in verse 8 is an interesting one. It says fond of sorted gain. A deacon is not fond of sorted gain.
[time=2318] Now again, the Bible never says that you can't be rich. The Bible never speaks disparagingly of having wealth.
[time=2327] It always speaks disparagingly of people who love their wealth, people who are lovers of money, people who have earned their money through illegitimate ways. And that's what's in view here.
[time=2340] He is not fond of sorted gain, money or wealth that has been earned through illegitimate ways, whether those be illegal investments, whether that be through fraudulently reporting incomes so that the taxes are not as high.
[time=2355] In whatever way this man comes into contact with his money, he earns it and he dispenses it in a way that he is free from gaining money illegitimately.
[time=2364] He rightly sees the money that God has given him as a steward chip and is to be employed in places that honor and exalt the living Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2375] Now this is an obvious qualification for a deacon because deacons are often in the process of handling the church's money.
[time=2382] Just the other night I was here on a Saturday night and I walked by the chapel over on the north side and there was a great ABF having a fantastic time. They were having so much fun, I heard them out in the hallway.
[time=2393] They were having an auction. They were raffling things off and you know they had a bitter system going on inside there and people were upping this and upping that and upping that and so I poked my head in there to see what all the fun was about and I found out that they were raising money for their missionary.
[time=2408] And so what they would do is people would donate a particular thing like a gift certificate, the scots and it was worth a certain amount of money and then people would just bid that thing up until it was well over its original value and all that stuff gets to go to the missionary.
[time=2421] Deacons are leading that. Deacons have handling on that money. If a person in our church is struggling and they're a part of an ABF and we know about it and we can help them financially after we've investigated the situation.
[time=2432] It's the Deacons recommendation that certain amounts of money come from the church to minister to that spiritual need or that financial need.
[time=2439] So this is an obvious qualification because Deacons are often with the people and they're with the people in financial ways.
[time=2446] Now verse 9 kind of wraps it all together but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience and the emphasis here is upon the man's conscience.
[time=2461] The man keeps a short account with God the way he lives his life not just according to the objective truth of the word of God but as that word of God is applied to his heart and mind the way it works out in his place of employment and with his wife and with his children he is constantly obeying the conscience that God has given him and the prompting of the spirit of God.
[time=2485] He's also one that is not found then in pretense a lot of times when you're brought into a position of leadership like a Deacon or an elder then there are all these expectations that people have of you that you do certain things at certain times and in certain ways and if you're just doing that because it's expected if you're just doing that because if you don't then people won't think as highly of you as you want them to think it becomes very hypocritical and you don't have a clear conscience.
[time=2513] So this really drives to the heart of the motive of the man he does these things he is a man of dignity he's not double tongue he's not addicted to much wine he's not fond of sorted gain he does his ministry of service in the church because it comes from his heart and his soul out of a deep love for God and a deep love for Christ and a deep love for the people that he serves.
[time=2533] So as a result he has a clear conscience. Now like the elder he must be tested like the elder he must be approved verse 10 and let these also first be tested then let them serve as Deacons if they are beyond reproach and the testing here is a positive testing.
[time=2553] It's not a negative suspicious kind of a wary eye as you see someone serving in the church and you look upon them with real suspicion kind of waiting for them to mess up.
[time=2565] That's not what's in view this is a real positive testing this is a testing with the anticipation of success with the hope that they will pass the test and find their way into service.
[time=2576] As I was studying it this week I was drawn back to an incident about two or three years ago my second eldest daughter Nikki came running in the house with all kinds of excitement and joy and just grabbed me and demanded that I come out into the driveway and onto the street and all excited.
[time=2591] You got to come see and what am I going to see and she's no no I can't tell you just come just come you got to watch.
[time=2596] So we got out on the street in the cul-de-sac there and my next eldest daughter my third daughter Kelly is standing there holding this little bike and Kelly had never ridden a bike before you know without training with.
[time=2608] And so Nikki says okay and so Kelly jumps up and Nikki's holding the handlebar in the seat and she says I don't forget you got a pedal you got a pedal and so push and then she pedaled you know Kelly got going there's little wobbly and then she forgot the pedal and so Nikki's right there running next you know go got a pedal you got a pedal you got a pedal you got a pedal okay now turn.
[time=2625] And there's Nikki coaching her through this entire thing why well because Nikki had just taught her for the first time how to ride her bike and she was testing her she was showing her off to mom and dad but it wasn't a test that was looking for failure it was a test or an approval process that was full of support and full of encouragement and full of commitment saying you can do it you can do it you can make it that's the notion that's the kind of testing in view here.
[time=2651] And so as you in leadership are working in your ABS and you're training up the next generation of leaders that's the attitude you get involved in their life and you see the raw potential and you're excited about what's there.
[time=2664] There resist the temptation to be negative and to be pointing out the flaws as opposed to bringing that positive approval process of testing into their life though at points correction would indeed be needed.
[time=2679] Okay now to verse 11 and it goes to an interesting transition this verse has been the subject of some controversy it talks about women or wives and here again we have the Greek word that could be translated either way it could be a woman in general or it could be translated a wife.
[time=2693] Women must likewise be dignified not malicious gossips but temperate faithful in all things.
[time=2703] Now there are three at least three possible interpretations of this verse who are these women well one interpretation is that they are the wives of the deacons.
[time=2714] In other words the deacons are being described in verse 8 verse 9 verse 10 and now we'll have a word about their wives the deacons wives they must likewise be dignified not malicious gossips etc etc.
[time=2727] Another view is that it's not the deacons wives it's just women in general just the women of the church the women of the church should be dignified not malicious gossips temperate and faithful in all things.
[time=2741] And then there's a third view and this is probably the view that that I favor and for reasons that I'll share with you here in a minute it's this that these women are not the wives of deacons these women are not just the general women of the church.
[time=2756] These are women who hold the office called deacons the office of deacons now I'm aware of the fact that our church works basically with the understanding that these are deacons wives and that's great and I'm overwhelmingly grateful for the ministry of our deacons and their wives but as we move through this I want to give you some food for thought about the interpretation of this passage.
[time=2777] Let me give you four reasons why I think this is an office called deaconess and then you can mull it over in your own mind first of all the word likewise.
[time=2786] Do you see it in verse 11 women must likewise be and then this list well come with me now to chapter 2 verse 9.
[time=2796] Remember now you're in a section of two chapters in length in which Paul is building and setting in place the structure of the church.
[time=2804] And when he begins with this notion of evangelistic prayer when he's finished with that he makes a transition to another subject and he begins that with this word likewise.
[time=2814] So it becomes a literary key to us we're moving from one topic to another verse 9 likewise I want women and then he goes on to describe that for them.
[time=2823] Then come back to chapter 3 and look at verse 8 he's going to transition again into another subject matter and he says deacons likewise must be men of dignity not double tongue etc etc.
[time=2837] And so the argument goes like this he's using likewise as a transitionary word to move from one subject matter to the next and when he uses it in verse 11 the translation would be women or deaconesses must likewise even as the male deacons must be this the women deacons must be this.
[time=2857] Secondly there is no possessive pronoun now some of your translations read and their wives and the possessive pronoun there is the word there.
[time=2870] It's not in the Greek text it's been put there by translators that happens in the King James as well.
[time=2877] So there is no personal pronoun and therefore one of the compelling reasons when you read it in the English to think that these are the wives of deacons isn't there at all in the Greek and Paul's been known to be pretty careful with his words and he didn't use it there.
[time=2891] So that's reason number two reason number three is the context is all about church leadership not mates in other words we're dealing with the leadership of the church in elders and deacons and then it seems somewhat a natural suddenly to talk about a mate in the middle of all that and here's my fourth reason if in fact it is the wives of deacons which it could be I mean there are good men on that point right there.
[time=2919] If it is then my question is this why doesn't it talk about elders wives in other words if deacons wives have qualifications why don't elders wives have qualifications and of course there are none there listed or anywhere in the Bible to qualify the wives of elders.
[time=2936] So for those four reasons the absence or the use of the word likewise as a literary key to transition from one subject to the next not exclusively he doesn't always use it but when he does he he uses it to move from one subject to the next.
[time=2949] Secondly the absence of the possessive pronoun the word there it's not in the Greek it's been added thirdly the context here is church leaders not the mates of church leaders and fourth the unbalanced approach then between qualifying deacons wives and failing the quality qualify elders wives.
[time=2968] So that's food for thought now notice the qualifications that are listed in verse 11 for these women or these wives there is a striking parallel between their qualifications and that of the deacon above the deacon must be men of dignity verse eight verse 11 the women must be dignified same thought same word.
[time=2989] Then it says the deacons must not be double tongue the women must not be malicious gassips same thought then it says that the deacons must not be addicted to much wine and it says of the of the women they must be temperate you remember when we looked at that with respect to elders the word temperate means balanced they're not out of control their their under control their life and it has an order and it has a balance.
[time=3014] So there'd be a parallel there between not being addicted to much wine and being balanced and temperate and then lastly in verse 11 faithful and all things these women or wives are faithful in in their responsibilities and their duties and that would correspond to verse nine and the deacon he is holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
[time=3034] So these women and may their tribe increase whether they be the wives of deacons or whether they be a separate office called deaconess are serving the church in all dignity they are not spreaders of rumors they are not full of malicious gossip you can trust them with your herds you can trust them with your struggles they are balanced in their approach and they are incredibly faithful.
[time=3059] Now then he resumes discussion of the deacons which might be a good argument against my view because why would you split this up but verse 12 let deacons be husbands of only one wife and good managers of their children and their own household and here again the apostle Paul is warning us not to qualify a man based upon his success in his place of employment.
[time=3086] The criteria must come back to his wife and to his children and if he is faithful with them if he is a godly man with them if he loves them in service and faithfulness then there is the qualification for his ministry inside the church.
[time=3104] Now verse 13 and this is the reward this is the reward for those who serve so faithfully for those who have served well as deacons obtain for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus they have a two full reward.
[time=3124] First is that they have obtained for themselves a high standing there is a growing respect for these men and women in their ministry the people of the church recognize them for who they are and they are held in high esteem.
[time=3143] Secondly they have a great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus you know there are a lot of people that struggle with the assurance of their salvation.
[time=3153] There are a lot of people who though they have prayed a prayer and been in the church for years have a real sense of questions still boy am I really saved and there are a lot of people who will go in and out of that in their life.
[time=3165] And what Paul is saying is that one of the rewards that comes to these deacons even as they are on the earth is that they will have an overwhelming confidence in the faith that they are truly saved the faith that they have in Jesus Christ there will be a sense of assurance.
[time=3181] They have found their niche in the body of Christ their servants they know it there is an ease to their service that feels right it feels natural it's fruitful people respond to it.
[time=3191] And as a result they have a real strong sense and inner assurance that they are born again and that they are saved.
[time=3200] So when all is said about you and about me better than them saying that there was some level of giftedness or some fruitfulness of ministry that they were especially blessed of God or that they were remarkably well known or popular.
[time=3218] Far better than anything of that nature it would be that we were found to be faithful servants that we gave ourself and that's the great thing about service.
[time=3228] I mean you don't have to be it doesn't depend upon your gift in some upfront shall we weigh.
[time=3236] Services a ministry that all of us can and should have we are led in this case by the deacons but anyone and everyone can serve.
[time=3248] So deacons deacons play a vital role in the life of the church they are to be men of dignity not double tongue not addicted to much wine or fond of sorted gain they hold the mystery of the faith with the clear conscience and they have been approved by the family.
[time=3265] In a very positive and affirming way their wives or a separate group of women called deaconesses are also dignified they are not malicious gossip they are temperate they are faithful in all things.
[time=3278] These deacons are one women men they love their wives they are devoted to their wife they are not playing the harlot in their heart they are faithful managers of their children their children love and honor and obey them.
[time=3293] And then these great temporal even at this point in time rewards they win the favor of the people as they are recognized as self sacrificing servants and they have inside their own hearts the great and marvelous confidence that they are indeed saved.
[time=3312] You know I believe there will be far greater reward at the beam of seat for the washing of feet than for the preaching to thousands.
[time=3323] And there are numbers of you and our mists whose names we don't know whose service has gone unnoticed because it doesn't happen in some of the obvious ways but God has watched and been delighted in every deed.
[time=3341] Church that is marked by servants is a godly church it is a loving church there may be some of you men in our assembly and women who would be challenged by this who would say my life is void of service.
[time=3358] I don't I can't think of really anybody that I'm serving except myself I perform some duties now and then because that's kind of a give and take if I don't do my part then they don't do their part but as far as just free will service or I'm not really serving anybody.
[time=3375] I'd encourage you to find it give yourself to it find a place to serve.
