[time=0] We've been studying New Testament leadership, elders and deacons, men who are qualified to lead the church from 1 Timothy chapter 3. And we're finding in that passage that God is first concerned with character and second with ability. His
[time=16] first commitment is to have men who love God and who have strong character and second who would have ministry skills. And if that simple truth is the nail, I like this morning to take an Old Testament character and use him as a hammer to drive that truth deep into our hearts. The man's name is Samson. And though he was marvelously gifted of God, he had a huge character deficit and his life ended
[time=40] up to be a failure.
[time=55] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find it in encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today Pastor Moore will continue his study of the characteristics of church leadership.
[time=67] However, today he will be using the Old Testament character of Samson to illustrate the importance of character quality. In our secular society, we often hear managers speak of an individual's capabilities and his ability to get the job done. In contrast, the Bible says God is much more interested in what a man is, rather than what he can do. He suggests that you locate your Bible and have it open to the Old Testament book of Judges.
[time=92] You will be looking at portions of chapters 13 to 16. Our special music today
[time=98] includes an old favorite from sisters Marilyn Wong and Marsha Richards and titled "Itsurper Miracle." As we prepare for a time of Bible study, let's join the
[time=108] sanctuary choir in orchestra as they remind us of that wonderful time in the future when we all get to heaven.
[time=141] When we all get to heaven, one day of rejoicing at the wind, when we all see Jesus,
[time=154] we'll swing and shun the victory.
[time=160] But when traveling days are over, not us and not us sun,
[time=181] when we all get to heaven, one day of rejoicing at the wind, when we all see Jesus,
[time=193] we'll swing and shun the victory.
[time=211] Let us envy true and faithful, trust in serving every day.
[time=227] Just one glimpse of living glory, with a lot of life prepared.
[time=243] When we all get to heaven, one day of rejoicing at the wind,
[time=255] when we all see Jesus, we'll swing and shun the victory.
[time=264] Onward to the prize be for us, to give beauty, we'll be born.
[time=273] To the early gains we'll open, we shall tell the streets of Rome.
[time=281] When we all get to heaven, one day of rejoicing at the wind, when we all get to heaven, one day of rejoicing at the wind, when we all see Jesus,
[time=294] we'll swing and shun the victory.
[time=303] When we all get to heaven, one day of rejoicing at the wind, when we all see Jesus, we'll swing and shun the victory.
[time=329] We're glad that you joined with us for the Bible hour again today.
[time=332] Also, we've talked about our groundbreaking and finally we've got a beautiful day in Indiana for groundbreaking today.
[time=338] We're grateful for that.
[time=339] It's an absolutely gorgeous day and I am thankful for it.
[time=342] In fact, I was praying about it.
[time=343] I was asking the Lord to, I don't want to take credit for it, but I was asking the Lord for a beautiful day and we have one and we're excited about it.
[time=349] It's a great day to be reminded again of the use of God's facilities for His glory and I'm sure that's going to happen as we build this building.
[time=357] This is always also a great week.
[time=359] It was spring break for our kids and many of them went down to Florida with our youth pastor.
[time=365] You know, I'm so thankful for our youth ministry here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=369] Tim Tedder is our youth pastor.
[time=371] He's about 35 years old and really Pete, I think one of the most gifted, capable youth pastors that I have ever met or certainly work with.
[time=379] A real maturity and a level of leadership that he gives to our youth ministry that's rare.
[time=385] But as you mentioned, they've been in Florida all week.
[time=389] They've been training for several months in how to share their faith with people and then this last week they've been doing.
[time=395] I spoke with him last night just when he got back and he said they had a tremendous time and had a number of very significant opportunities to share the gospel.
[time=403] And I guess your son was a part of the team.
[time=406] Right, it's always glad for the young people to go and in particular my own kids, Peter went a few years ago and Andy went this last year and this year and a tremendous time of training and fellowship among the kids in that opportunity to talk to people that they've never met before about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=424] That's really great.
[time=425] We want to remind you again of some special events that are coming up in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=430] We're going to have a Good Friday service downtown in Fort Wayne at the Grand Wayne Center on Good Friday April 17th.
[time=438] That service will be from 1215 to 1245 during most people's lunch hour.
[time=443] So if you work in that area, bring a friend and come join us on the second floor of the Grand Wayne Center for our Good Friday service.
[time=450] And then our drama this year for Easter is entitled Spark in Judea. It'll be presented on Saturday evening April 18th at 7pm and then again on the Easter Sunday evening April 19th at 6pm.
[time=464] You need a ticket to get in, the tickets are free and you can call the church office here at 7, that is 493 7400 or you can stop in at the church and get tickets during the week from 8am until 5pm in the afternoon.
[time=481] I hope that you'll join with us. If you don't have anything going on, it'll be an inspiration for you to join with us at that time.
[time=488] Russell, we have some other information. I'm sure that many of the people that are watching know that Pastor Jim Pearson has been with us for a number of years as Associate Pastor of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=498] And he's leaving us. This will be his last day as he fellowships with us and we'll be going to Fargo, North Dakota.
[time=505] Amazing. You know, Jim and Linda have been praying now for about a year that God would open up for them the opportunity to go and preach and teach the gospel.
[time=513] That's what Jim really feels called to do primarily. We're excited for that. We support them and I know their hearts are full of anticipation for what the Lord is going to do in the years to come.
[time=523] Well, I know that the Bethel Evangelical Free Church in Fargo, North Dakota is going to benefit from the ministry of Jim and Linda and even their boys. They're great, vivacious young guys that are going to grow up to love the Lord, I'm sure.
[time=535] So we wish them well. We're sorry to see them go from Black Hawk, but we know that his heart is in this ministry there and he'll begin his ministry next week there in Fargo, North Dakota.
[time=545] Just before we go back to the live portion of our service, many of you are avid readers. I know that not only reading the scripture, but perhaps reading various books throughout the week.
[time=554] So as a gift to you this month, we'd like to send you a ribbon that goes inside your Bible or a book that says this is Easter and has the Bible hour logo on it.
[time=564] And we'd like to send it to you absolutely free if you'll write to us today at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=576] Just ask for the Easter ribbon and we'd love to hear from you in particular during this month of April. Again, the address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=590] We go back to the live portion of our program now with more music and then the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=606] There is a new tent and that you can't deny a God of white and miracles.
[time=620] It took a miracle to put the stars in space, it took a miracle to hang the world in space.
[time=646] But when he saved my soul, cleansed and made me whole, it took a miracle of love and grace.
[time=672] The Bible tells us of his palm and wisdom all the way through and every little bird and flower our testimonies too.
[time=695] It took a miracle to put the stars in space, it took a miracle to hang the world in space.
[time=714] But when he saved my soul, cleansed and made me whole, it took a miracle of love and grace.
[time=743] Amen. That's so true, a miracle of love to save my soul and make me whole. Thank you, Maryland and Marsha.
[time=762] You can't tell it from the bulletin, but they're sisters. You can probably tell it from the way their voice is so beautifully blend.
[time=768] Thank you so much for your ministry. Let's take our Bibles this morning and go back to first Timothy.
[time=776] If you're here as a visitor or haven't been with us for a while, we've been studying through a significant portion of Scripture and it's all about church leadership, spiritual leaders in the church.
[time=788] The passage in view here is about a church that was formed about 63 AD. It's the Church of Ephesus. It was planted by none other than the Apostle Paul on one of his missionary journeys.
[time=801] And the city of Ephesus is being dominated by the temple Diana or the temple Artemis and this is one of the seventh wonders of the ancient world and it's a pagan worship.
[time=811] It's an ungodly commitment to idolatry and to all kinds of deviant sexual worship in hopes of fertility and all the rest.
[time=819] And it's very much the dominating force in the city of Ephesus, but Paul went there with the truth. Paul went there with the gospel of Jesus Christ and started telling people about Jesus and they repented of their sins. They turned from dead idols to the true and living God.
[time=833] And now some 12 years later as we find the writing of this book from the first convert, we have a church, the church at Ephesus. It probably wasn't a church like ours where everybody met in one big building. They would have met in several different people's homes and they would have gathered there to worship the Lord and study the Scriptures and sing and pray.
[time=854] But though the church is only 12 years old and though it was planted by the foremost of the Apostles, the Apostle Paul, he spent three and a half years there and says he taught them the whole council of God.
[time=865] Yet within a short 12 years the church at Ephesus is falling. The foundation on which it is built is crumbling. The truth of God as it has been taught them by Paul is under attack.
[time=876] Paul's prophets, false teachers have infiltrated the church from the outside. They have also come from within and they are distorting and perverting the true gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=887] And so Paul designs to confront that heresy with a man, first of all, a young man by the name of Timothy. A man he himself led to the Lord and has now instructed to remain on in Ephesus.
[time=898] And he arms Timothy for battle with this book, the book of first Timothy. And in it he gives very explicit instructions as to how he is to confront this false doctrine through these false teachers.
[time=911] And one of the avenues that he gives Timothy to confront them is to lift up the qualifications for true leadership. In other words, ungodly men, men who are teaching heresy have made it into leadership and the little house churches throughout the city of Ephesus.
[time=926] And the way that we will expose them and the way that we will deal with them is I will give you a template. I will give you the example. I will give you the standard of true godliness.
[time=935] And you lift that up against their lives. And if they don't meet it, then they're out of leadership. And that problem is solved.
[time=942] We've been studying that in some detail in chapter 3 verses 1 through 7, the qualifications of elders, and in chapter 3 verses 8 through 14, the qualifications of deacons and deacons wives or the office of deacons depending upon how you look at that.
[time=957] And we've gone into great detail in the last several weeks examining each phrase in each word as it's been our search to try to understand what it is that qualifies a man or a woman in these various roles.
[time=971] But this morning I want to step back from that and I want to put flesh and blood to it. I want to say this to you, the overwhelming message that we find from 1 Timothy 3 about church leadership is this.
[time=983] The most important thing about a church leader is his character. It's first of all who you are in Christ that qualifies you for leadership not what you can do, not your ministry skills, not your giftedness.
[time=997] God qualifies men and women for roles in the church based upon who they are, not based upon what they might be able to do, whether spiritually gifted or naturally gifted.
[time=1007] And if that truth is the nail, if you will, we'll call it a 16 penny nail. God is concerned about your character, not your ability.
[time=1015] We'll drive that nail home this morning with the hammer of a person out of the Old Testament, an Old Testament character, and hopefully drive it into your heart and mind so that it will be forever ingrained in your heart.
[time=1029] This Old Testament character, we find him about 3000 years ago and he stands out in the Old Testament as possibly one of the most gifted men recorded anywhere in the Old Testament, both naturally and spiritually.
[time=1042] But he had a huge character deficit and his life was an absolute disaster. He never married, he had no family and his reputation outside the church was horrible.
[time=1055] He is for us a great example of one who has been given maximum giftedness and yet has made a minuscule contribution to the kingdom of God. Who am I speaking about? 1075 BC, he was a warrior noted to fight most often by himself.
[time=1073] 11 others held the same title as did he? The Achilles heel in his life and ministry were women. He had long hair that eventually was braided into seven locks. That was eventually cut off and at that point in his life he lost all of his strength in his ministry.
[time=1091] We know him as Samson. Would you come with me to the book of Judges and we'll study this morning the negative example, the opposite of what an elder or a deacon is to be by virtue of Samson's character deficit.
[time=1105] Judges, chapters 13 and following, there are four chapters that are devoted to Samson.
[time=1114] As I said, he is one of twelve judges recorded for us in this period of Israel's history and the narrative begins in chapter 13.
[time=1124] Now I mention to you that he is possibly one of the most gifted personalities in all of the Old Testament. Let me give you five reasons I believe that.
[time=1132] Five unique credentials in his ministry. It begins in chapter 13 verse 3. Then the angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, "Behold, now you are barren and have born no children, but you shall conceive and give birth to a son."
[time=1150] The angel of the Lord appeared. That puts Samson in the category with some other famous people who had their birth pronounced by an angel.
[time=1161] Isaac had his birth pronounced by an angel. John the Baptist the same and of course Christ's birth was announced by an angel.
[time=1168] So he had a prophetic pronunciation of his birth and that would be his calling. Secondly, look at his consecration.
[time=1176] Chapter 13 verse 5, "For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son and no razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb."
[time=1189] That's the Nazarite vow recorded for us in Numbers chapter 6. It was a special unique vow that people would take, sometimes men, sometimes women, to publicly identify with the true and the living God.
[time=1203] And the vow really had three parts. It was a commitment to abstain from wine, from touching dead bodies and from having your haircut.
[time=1212] No cocktails, no corpses and no cuffures or coffers, no haircuts. These were certain things the man was saying that I will not do as an outward sign of commitment to serving the living God.
[time=1225] They were merely outward signs of an internal commitment. Now the length of the Nazarite vow could vary from person to person.
[time=1232] For some people it might have been a year or several months, but for Samson it was his entire life. For the boy shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb.
[time=1243] Beyond his call and his consecration there is his cause also recorded for us in verse 5 towards the end of the verse.
[time=1250] And he shall begin to deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines. He was a judge and his responsibility was to deliver the nation of Israel from the hands of the Philistines.
[time=1262] We look up at verse 1, chapter 13. Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord, so that the Lord gave them into the hands of the Philistines 40 years.
[time=1273] This period of Israel's history known as the Judges period is 200 years in length, 12 judges served in this period of time.
[time=1281] And what would happen is the people would forsake the true in the living God and they would fall into idolatrous worship and sin.
[time=1287] And God out of his love for them would chastise them with a foreign army of some kind, in this case the Philistines, that he would bring them into bondage and oppression.
[time=1296] Eventually it would become so tired of that that they would cry out to God in repentance for deliverance from the oppressor and God would raise up a judge.
[time=1304] The judge would defeat the oppressor and the people would return to God.
[time=1308] The problem is they did this in cyclical motion and they did it over and over and over and over again and each time they became more sinful and more sinful and more sinful.
[time=1318] Sansin comes to us at the end of this 200 year period, his is the last cycle and so the people are grossly sinful.
[time=1326] The whole era is characterized by a little phrase that appears twice in the book of Judges, chapter 17, verse 6, I'll read it to you.
[time=1333] It says this, "In those days there was no king in Israel. Every man did what was right in his own eyes andarchy. No absolutes, no law of God, no moral commitment or restraints.
[time=1345] They did whatever they wanted to do, whatever was right in their own eyes." It sounds a little bit like America.
[time=1352] He had a unique calling, he had a unique consecration and his cause was to be raised up by God as a judge to deliver the nation of Israel from the oppression of the Philistines.
[time=1363] Notice fourthly that he had a very unique childhood. Come to the end of that chapter, chapter 13 and look at verse 24.
[time=1370] Then the woman gave birth to a son and named him, Sansin, and the child grew up and the Lord blessed him.
[time=1379] And we don't know all the details, but we know that as he was growing up and maturing, the blessing of the Lord was upon him.
[time=1386] And then his last qualification for ministry in verse 25 and the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him.
[time=1394] The Spirit of the Lord began to stir him. If you were to take the time to read the entire book of judges, you would find that that phrase is only applied to two of the other judges recorded.
[time=1406] In chapter 3, a judge by the name of Othnell was also said to have the Spirit of God come upon him but only once.
[time=1416] And then in chapter 6, Gideon, it was said of him that the Spirit of God came upon him but again only once.
[time=1423] And if you were to read the four chapters of Sansin's life, you'd find the Spirit of God coming upon him five different distinct times.
[time=1430] He was uniquely blessed with the ministry of the Spirit of God. And each time it was an endowment of the Spirit of God with special strength to authenticate his ministry and to certify that he was indeed the man that God had raised up to deliver the nation of Israel from the Philistines.
[time=1447] Unbelievable beginning, unbelievable credentials, unbelievable giftedness, unbelievable potential to impact the world for the kingdom of God.
[time=1457] But instead we find a life that is marred and pockmarked by a lack of character and as a result failure, character deficit after character deficit.
[time=1468] And I'd like us to examine seven areas in his life, seven cracks in the dike if you will which brought about his moral collapse.
[time=1476] We'll begin in chapter 14 verses 1 and 2. Then Sansin went down to Timna and saw a woman in Timna, one of the daughters of the Philistines.
[time=1488] So he came back and told his father and mother, I saw a woman in Timna, one of the daughters of the Philistines. Now therefore get her for me as a wife.
[time=1496] He says, "I'm in love. I've found her. This is it. This is the one." And we believe Sansin to be about 20 years old at this time.
[time=1503] But notice what his mother and his father have to say to him in verse 3, "Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives or among all the people that you go to take away from the uncircumcised Philistines?"
[time=1515] But Sansin said to his father, "Get her for me. For she looks good to me." That was his criteria. She's beautiful. I want her.
[time=1524] Now what appears to be just kind of a general nudge from mom and dad that maybe this isn't the brightest idea, you know, that Mary outside the nation of Israel is really supported by divine decree and command in Exodus 34 and Deuteronomy 7.
[time=1540] God specifically stated that the people of Israel should not marry into the neighbouring communities or the neighbouring peoples, the Hittites, the Garazites, the Emirates, the Canaanites, the Parazites, the Hivites, the Jebusites.
[time=1553] Let's go fly a kite. All those people were completely off territory and out of bounds for the people of the nation of Israel.
[time=1560] They were to marry inside the faith. He wanted nothing to do with that.
[time=1565] The reason God gave them, and that is a safeguard, not to marry outside the faith is because once you marry her, then she's going to have you eventually worship her God.
[time=1574] She's going to steal your heart away from the true and living God. And before long you'll be worshipping a false God. So don't even marry them. Marry inside the faith.
[time=1582] So, chink number one in the armor of Samson was that he had never learned to obey the authority in his life. Great leaders are first great followers.
[time=1595] Let me say that again. Great leaders are first great followers. Before you'll ever be a great leader, you'll learn to be a great follower.
[time=1601] You'll learn especially in the household of God that you ought to submit yourself to authority, to submit yourself to authority, to do what you are told to do, whether it's from the Word of God, or even from your parents as a young man.
[time=1613] Proverbs 15-5 says it this way.
[time=1616] A fool rejects his father's discipline. A fool rejects his father's discipline. Proverbs 17-25, a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him.
[time=1633] If you're a young man and you're aspiring to godliness in your life, to be an elder or to be a deacon or to be a pastor, the first place you need to evaluate your life is, "Are you obeying your parents?"
[time=1644] And you say, "But I'm 15 now. I'm 16. I'm 17. I'm 18. I'm a grown-up now." Well, that may be true, but God is looking past your age right into your heart to find out if you are willing to submit to your parents and to their authority in your life.
[time=1661] Because if you're willing to submit to them, you're willing to submit to the law of God and all the other areas of your life where authority is brought to bear.
[time=1668] The other way I'll say it is this, if you're a little bit older and you're now 30 or 40 or 50 and you look back in your life and you remember that as a young man, you did not submit to your parents.
[time=1679] There is every reason to suspect whether or not that rebellion isn't still running around in your heart.
[time=1685] Have you tamed that? Have you gone back and apologized if they're still living and confessed to them? You know, I was a rebel. I was disobedient in your household. I gave you a hard time.
[time=1695] And I can see that now. Will you forgive me for that? That'd be a good place to start.
[time=1700] And then begin to search out other areas of your life where authority is over you and submit to it.
[time=1706] So, chink number one, Samson never learned to obey the authority in his life. Number two, look at chapter 14 verse 8.
[time=1716] It says when he returned later to take her, this is that Philistine woman that he wanted.
[time=1722] He turned aside to look at the carcass of the lion and behold a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion.
[time=1729] So he scraped the honey into his hand and went on eating as he went.
[time=1734] He said what lion? Well, look up at verse 5, the end of the verse. A young lion came roaring toward him. He was on his way down to Timna.
[time=1743] And this lion comes roaring towards him out of the rocks or the trees or the bushes. And the spirit of the Lord verse 6 came upon him mightily so he tore him as one tear as a kid.
[time=1753] This frost is lion comes at him. He just rips the thing up, kills it, leaves it there dead.
[time=1759] He goes on his way and then on his return trip he comes by that same lion. And apparently it's dried out now and bees have moved in and built a hive and there's honey there.
[time=1770] So he reaches in and grabs the honey and eats it. He says so what? Well, remember his nasorite vow? He wasn't supposed to touch any dead corpse.
[time=1780] And in order to satisfy his taste buds and his stomach, he broke his vow to God and reached in the carcass of that lion and grabbed something to satisfy himself with.
[time=1793] Chink number 2 is that Samson wasn't a man of his word. Samson didn't keep his word. He didn't keep his vows. And you know the principle you've heard it before that if you can do it once it becomes easier every time you do it.
[time=1805] This time he did it in private. Nobody was around. He later made a riddle out of it. And we find him later in this chapter touching all kinds of dead corpses and now not in private but even in public.
[time=1817] Look at what happened in verse 12 of chapter 14. Samson said to them, "Let me now propound a riddle to you. These are some thirty men that had gathered around him of the Philistines as a part of this wedding ceremony."
[time=1829] And it was apparently customary in this ancient world when you're having a seven day ceremony to propound some riddles at the beginning and see who could get them and how quickly.
[time=1838] Verse 12, "If you will indeed tell it to me within seven days of the feast and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothing."
[time=1846] Now we don't know what these linen wraps are. They're best guesses. They're just large linen wraps. They'd sleep in them or wear them as an undergarment.
[time=1853] Verse 13, "If you're unable to tell me, then you shall give me thirty linen wraps and thirty changes of clothes and they said to him, 'Okay, give us your riddle.' Verse 14.
[time=1862] So he said to them, "Out of the eater came something to eat and out of the strong came something sweet, but they could not tell the riddle in three days."
[time=1872] Verse 15, "They said to Samson's wife, now they call her his wife because of the betrothal deal."
[time=1879] They say, "This entice your husband that he may tell us the riddle." Well, she goes to him and she says, "Can you tell me the riddle?" And he says, "No." But then down in verse 17, it came about on the seventh day that he told her because she pressed him so hard, she was just relentless.
[time=1894] So he tells her, she tells them, and he loses the deal, look at verse 18, "What is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion?"
[time=1906] And he said to them, "If you had not plowed with my heifer," it's quite a name there for your engaged to be wife.
[time=1913] Like to meet my heifer, this is Susie. We're going to be married in a few days. What do you think of her?
[time=1919] "If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle." Well, now he owes everybody all these guys, he's got to come up with 30 changes of clothes.
[time=1929] So what does he do? The spirit of the Lord comes upon him in verse 19 and he goes down to Ashkelon and killed 30 of them and took their spoil and gave changes of clothes to those who he told the riddle.
[time=1940] Well, it's a nice way to solve his problem, it didn't cost him much except his vow.
[time=1946] Now he's killed 30 men, they're lying there dead. How do you think he got their clothes off their bodies so that he could deliver them to the men he owed them? He touched their body.
[time=1956] He begins breaking his vow in secret. He begins breaking his vow and no one looks on just the carcass of a lion.
[time=1963] But with time he's done it in private, he may as well do it in public and so in front of the very men he's supposed to be judging the Philistines themselves, he openly breaks his nasorite vow.
[time=1975] Samson wasn't a man of his word.
[time=1977] Number three, we pick it up in chapter 14 verse 20.
[time=1982] Samson's wife was given to his companion who had been his friend. In other words, his best man consummated the marriage that night, unbelievable situation.
[time=1993] And it just stops right there. Now chapter 15 verse 1, after a while, in the time of wheat harvest it came about that Samson visited his wife with a young goat and said, "I will go into my wife in her room."
[time=2007] But her father did not let him in her. Now that took a lot of bravery to stand in front of a guy like Samson.
[time=2012] And her father said, "I really thought you hated her intensely so I gave her to your companion."
[time=2018] "Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please let her be yours instead."
[time=2024] Samson then said to them, "This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them arms." So he took 300 foxes, somehow he caught those. He took torches and tied them in their tails as he tied them all together and set them running through the fields.
[time=2039] Verse 5, "Burning up both the shocks and the standing grain along with the vineyards and the groves. He destroyed all of their produce."
[time=2047] Now remember, they don't go get that stuff at the local Scots Market Store. I mean this is it. This is an agrarian community. This is their wealth. This is who they are. This is how they eat. This is what they're all about.
[time=2056] And he just wipes it all out. Verse 6, "So the Philistines at the end of that verse came up and burned her and her father with fire."
[time=2065] They say, "Well, Samson, if that's how you're going to treat us, we're going to take that woman that you want and we're going to take her father and we'll just burn them."
[time=2072] Verse 7, "Samson said to them, "Since you act like this, kind of a nanny, nanny, nanny, I will surely take revenge on you."
[time=2079] But after that I will quit. So, verse 8, "He struck them ruthlessly with a great slaughter." What's chink number three?
[time=2088] Samson was controlled by his uncontrolled emotion. He was in a fit of rage. He was out of control. He was just running around slaughtering and murdering and destroying.
[time=2101] Without any sense of the plan of God and view, this is just his own revenge that he's taking on people that aren't treating him the way he wants to be treated.
[time=2110] Uncontrolled emotion. And often I want you to notice in chapter 15, verse 3, "When you have a man with uncontrolled emotion, he then has also distorted judgment."
[time=2121] And he tries to whitewash his behavior. This time, verse 3, "I shall be blameless in regard of the Philistines when I do them harm."
[time=2129] Trying to justify his own sin. Trying to justify his own behavior. Trying to justify his own explosive anger.
[time=2136] Number 4. This is an interesting situation. In verse 8, after he's done this great slaughter, he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Adam.
[time=2149] Verse 9. The Philistines went up and camped in Judah. Now they come for war because they want this guy. Verse 10.
[time=2155] And when the men of Judah saw this, they said, "Why have you come up against us?" And they said, "We have come to bind Samson in order to do to him just as he did us."
[time=2166] Verse 11. This is amazing.
[time=2169] 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Adam and said to Samson, "These Philistines are here and we want to take you and bind you and give you to them."
[time=2180] This is the people of Israel. 3,000 of them go get their own judge. The one that God has given to them to deliver them from the very Philistines who are going to attack.
[time=2189] And they say, "No, we don't want to fight with him. We'll just bind him and deliver him to our enemies."
[time=2196] Verse 12. At the end of the verse, "Samson said to them, 'I'll let you bind me but swear to me that you'll not kill me.'"
[time=2204] So they say, "Okay, we won't do that. We'll just bind you." Verse 14.
[time=2210] "He comes out and the Philistines shout as they meet him and the spirit of the Lord came upon him mightily so that the ropes that were in his arms were as flax that is burned with fire and his bonds dropped from his hands."
[time=2222] And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey so he reached out and took it and killed a thousand men with it.
[time=2229] This is Rambo of Yesteryear. I mean, this guy is taking on an entire platoon without the plastic explosives.
[time=2235] He just grabs this jawbone and starts flailing and literally kills a thousand guys because the spirit of the Lord had come upon him.
[time=2245] But look at his evaluation of what has happened here. Verse 16. Then Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey heaps upon heaps with the jawbone of a donkey. The living Lord of Israel has slain a thousand men."
[time=2262] Is that what your Bible says? You're thinking, "What version are you reading?" No, that's not what my Bible says either. It says, "I, with the jawbone of a donkey, I have killed a thousand men."
[time=2274] Chained number four and this man's armor is he has a self-aggrandizing evaluation of his ministry accomplishments.
[time=2282] When he looks back over what God has done in his life, he takes the credit for it.
[time=2287] He thinks he's the critical link. He thinks he's the one that really made that whole thing happen.
[time=2292] The really he was the guy, the reason that ministry flourished. It's me. It was my presence. It was my contribution. It was my effort.
[time=2300] And that is so such a deadly trap for a leader to get into. When he's a part of a ministry and it's going well for him to assume that he is the reason for the success of that ministry.
[time=2312] And then, chained number five is found in verse 18. Right after all this had happened, he threw the jawbone from his hand. And he became very thirsty.
[time=2322] And he called to the Lord and said, "That has given this great deliverance. Now, finally, he does give knowledge to the Lord, but that privately in his own heart. By the hand of thy servant. And now shall I die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?"
[time=2337] This is a little bit of an insight into his devotional life. This is his prayer life. You know what he prays for? Himself.
[time=2344] There's no prayer here for the nation of Israel. Lord, now that these thousand people have been slaughtered, help us to rise up and rid them of the land so that we can go on to proclaim the living true and only God Yahweh.
[time=2354] There's no prayer here for the people of his nation or for the glory of God. It's just, hey, now that this is over, I'm thirsty. What are you going to let me die out here? Give me some water.
[time=2364] This too is a mark of a character deficit and a leader, a man who evaluates his own devotional life. And he only prays for his own ministry.
[time=2375] He only prays for his own situation. You never hear his heart bleeding and crying out for the salvation of souls and other parts of the world or other parts of the city through other ministries.
[time=2386] He simply prays for his own ministry and his own little sphere of influence.
[time=2396] Number five. That was number five. Number six. You pick this one up in verse one of chapter 16 and this would be his most notorious weakness.
[time=2408] It's been about 20 years since those events occurred. We believe him now to be about 40 years of age and he goes to Gaza and he saw a harlot there and he went into her.
[time=2419] He went into that harlot. Samson was not a one woman man. And she is really only a precursor to the rest of the chapter.
[time=2430] If you look at verse four, it says there after this, it came about that he loved the woman in the valley of Zorak whose name was Delilah.
[time=2439] Now we don't know a lot about Delilah. We don't know if Delilah was an Israelite or if she was a Gentile.
[time=2447] We don't know if Samson was married to Delilah or if he was just living with her.
[time=2452] But we do know that Samson was willing to sacrifice his entire ministry for her.
[time=2459] You remember the situation, the lords of the Philistines there in verse five come up to her and say, "Hey, entice him and see where his great strength lies, how he may overpower him, that we may bind him to afflict him, then we will each give you 1100 pieces of silver."
[time=2478] Well, she did that. She asked him and kept asking him three times he lied to her. The first time he said, "If they bind me with seven fresh cords, then I'll be weak and you can take me in a captivity." Of course, he broke out of those.
[time=2490] In verse 11, he says, "If they bind me tightly with new ropes, that'll do it. Then I'll be weak." And they did that. And of course, he broke out of that.
[time=2497] And then over in verse 13, towards the end, he said, "If you weave my..." He's getting close. "If you weave the seven locks of my hair with the web and fasten it with a pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man." Of course, that was a lie.
[time=2512] And he was just as strong as ever.
[time=2515] Now watch this. This is an interesting relationship. Look at verse 15. "Then she said to him, "How can you say I love you?
[time=2525] When your heart is not with me, you have deceived me these three times and have not told me where your great strength is."
[time=2532] Now that's an interesting thought. I mean, she's trying to figure out exactly where his strength is so that she can then afflict him and hand him over to his death.
[time=2541] And he's lying to her about it and she's kind of, "Well, Jesus, how can you say we have a relationship here? You're not even telling me the truth."
[time=2548] Unbelievable. And that's got to tell you something about her evaluation of him and the quality of that relationship. There is nothing there. There is just treachery and deceit.
[time=2560] It came about when she pressed in verse 16 daily with her words and urged him that his soul was annoyed to death.
[time=2569] So he told her all that was in her heart and said to her, "A razor has never come upon my head for I have been a nasorite to God from my mother's womb.
[time=2578] If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me and I shall become weak and be like any other man."
[time=2586] Cheink number seven. Samson couldn't hold privileged information. Samson had a loose tongue. Remember back in chapter 14, his almost wife of Timna, she pressed him over and over and over again about the riddle and he eventually gave her the information, which led to that whole debacle.
[time=2606] Here again, obviously he knew her intent. She even said it, verse 16, chapter 16, verse 6. So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me where your great strength is and how you may be bound to afflict you."
[time=2620] She said, "I want to know how I can afflict you. I want to know where your strength is so I can afflict you." He wasn't doped by her. He knew her intentions, but he couldn't even hold that information back from her and eventually slipped it right out of his own mouth.
[time=2635] Proverbs 10, 19 says it this way, "When there are many words, transgression is unavoidable, but he who restrains his lips is wise."
[time=2650] Well, you know how this whole story ends. She cut his hair after she got him to fall asleep on her knees. She called somebody in to cut off all of his hair. She gave off his seven locks.
[time=2664] And then he awakes, verse 20. She said, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson, and he awoke from his sleep and said, 'I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.'"
[time=2677] But he did not know that the Lord had departed from him. Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze chains and he was a grinder in the prison.
[time=2690] Spent the rest of his life as a grinder, as a prisoner in slave labor. It's a tragic thing. A man with incredible potential.
[time=2703] His ministry was gone. There was no more of him. There was no more of his life. He was not serving God anymore. He was blind and bound and confined to slave labor.
[time=2716] It's worse though. It gets worse. He becomes an occasion for the Philistines to mock the true and living God.
[time=2725] Verse 23, "Now the Lords of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to dag on their God and to rejoice," for they said, "Our God has given Samson our enemy into our hands."
[time=2737] And when the people saw him, they praised their God. They praised their false God for they said, "Our God has given our enemy into our hands, even the destroyer of our country who has slain many of us."
[time=2749] See, there he is. Look at that. That's the best the God of Israel could do. He's blind. He's chained. We own him. He does slave labor for us. Praise our God. Praise dag on.
[time=2763] So instead of his original calling of being raised up to wipe the Philistines out and to exalt the true and living God so that the world would know that it is Yahweh that rules the world.
[time=2777] This very man, Samson's life now is a debacle. It is scandalous. He has brought reproach upon the name of the true and living God.
[time=2788] Well, they were having such a good time doing that, verse 25. It happened that when they were in high spirits, there's a big huge party here and there's several thousand people in attendance.
[time=2797] The Lords of the Philistines are having a great time and now the spirits are up. They're probably drunk.
[time=2802] And they said, "Call for Samson that he may amuse us. They can taunt him and his God."
[time=2809] So they called for Samson from the prison and he entertained them. And we don't know what that means. We don't know what he did or what they did to him.
[time=2815] Or it may have just been this chanting and singing of this song about our God having given our enemy into our hands.
[time=2823] They made him stand at the universe 25 between the pillars. And Samson said to the boy who was holding his hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests that I may lean against them."
[time=2836] Now look up at 22. However, the hair of his head began to grow again after it was shaved off and apparently it had gone unnoticed by the Philistines. Verse 27.
[time=2848] Now the house was full of men and women and all the Lords of the Philistines were there and about 3,000 men and women were on the roof looking on while Samson was amusing them.
[time=2858] Then Samson called to the Lord and said, "O Lord God, please remember me and please strengthen me just this time, O God, that I may at once."
[time=2868] And this is where I must confess I am again profoundly disappointed with Samson, that I may at once be avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.
[time=2878] He was selfish to the end. Why couldn't he have prayed, "O Lord God, please remember me and strengthen me just this time, O God, because I brought reproach upon your name. And you had raised me up even from my mother's womb to exalt and honor your name and to liberate the Israelites and to do away with the Philistines.
[time=2898] And instead I'm a debacle and I'm an excuse and I'm the brunt of their jokes and I give occasion to the worship of a false God, O God, please just this once, let me get it right."
[time=2910] No such prayer, no such heart, no such commitment for the cause of Christ. Instead just this, "O God, that I may at once be avenged the Philistines of my eyes."
[time=2922] Let me pay him back. Let me go tit for tat one more time. Verse 29, "Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested and braced himself against them. The one with his right hand and the other with his left."
[time=2938] And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." And he bent with all his might so that the house fell in the lords and all the people who were in it.
[time=2948] Now this is tragic. Look at this last sentence in verse 30, "So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed in his life."
[time=2960] What a tragic commentary. In his last fleeting moment, bound, blinded and ridiculed, he had more fruit in his death than he did in his entire life.
[time=2976] Unlimited potential for the cause of Christ. Unlimited potential for the kingdom of God. And he's reduced to this one last selfish prayer and desperate attempt of going tit for tat with the people who took his eyes out.
[time=2992] And in spite of it all, God somehow uses it. And there's more fruit in his death than in all of his life.
[time=3002] Samson had unlimited potential for God. He had a privileged calling, a privileged consecration, a privileged cause to be the one to free the people of the nation of Israel, the apple of God's eye, so that they again can dispense the knowledge which leads to faith, that the other nations of the world should come to know the true and living God.
[time=3030] He had a blessed childhood, and he had an enormous capacity for ministry. Five times the Spirit of God comes upon him.
[time=3040] But he failed to protect that potential in the fortress of Godly character.
[time=3048] As a result, his life was an absolute disaster. Now somehow, some way, in the mercy and grace of God, his name shows up in Hebrews 11, with those who find their way into the hall of fame of faith.
[time=3061] After his death, there was a great routing of the Philistines, and they were freed eventually.
[time=3068] And it's really more by God's grace than anything else that brought Samson into that list.
[time=3074] But it reminds us, and it impresses deeply into our hearts and our minds, this one simple truth.
[time=3083] God cares more about who you are, your character, and he cares about what you can do in ministry.
[time=3092] God qualifies men and women in the New Testament not on the basis of what they can do, but on the basis of who they are.
[time=3098] Samson couldn't obey authority, didn't obey authority. Elders and Deacons view themselves as servants who do not lord their authority over their subjects as the Gentiles do.
[time=3109] Elders and Deacons have come to serve and to give their life away.
[time=3113] Samson was impulsive and couldn't even keep his word to hold his hand back from the bitter or the sweet taste of honey.
[time=3120] He was out of control, but Elders and Deacons are temperate and prudent.
[time=3125] Samson was out of control and a fit of rage, uncontrolled emotion.
[time=3132] Elders and Deacons are gentle and uncontentious.
[time=3138] Samson had an impoverished devotional life, praying only for himself to satisfy the most base of needs.
[time=3146] Elders are able to teach. Elders are profound in the word of God.
[time=3151] Elders labor to the point of exhaustion so that they can know the truth of the word of God and then give it away to those who need to know it as they disciple others to maturity.
[time=3162] Samson had a self-aggrandizing review of his own ministry giving himself the credit.
[time=3167] Deacons are those who hold to the mystery of the faith.
[time=3172] Deacons hold to the faith of Christ, embracing the person of Jesus Christ and are well aware that if anything of any value comes out of their life it is because the grace of God has been active there.
[time=3182] Whatever God would do in my life would be for his glory, they say, not my own.
[time=3190] Samson married out of the faith or intended to. Samson was an adulterer with a harlot. Samson was totally overcome by his lustful passion for delilah to the extent that he would sacrifice his own ministry.
[time=3204] But Elders and Deacons are one women men, simple devoted and pure.
[time=3214] Samson couldn't hold privileged information. Samson gave it out to his own demise.
[time=3221] Deacons are remembered by us as being not doubled-tongued. Not double-tongued. You can trust privileged information with a deacon.
[time=3230] Because he won't use that information for his own advance or for his own benefit. He'll treasure it for what it is, your property.
[time=3238] Samson started with such potential and ended with, so very, very little, a poet said it this way.
[time=3250] Across the fields of yesterday he sometimes comes to me, the little lad just back from play, the boy I used to be.
[time=3259] He smiles at me so wistfully, but once he has crept within, it is as though he hoped to see the man I might have been.
[time=3271] The man I might have been. You ever think about that? You ever go back and think of you as a little boy, as you were growing up, and the choices you made, and you see yourself out there on the playground, or you see yourself in relationship with your parents, and you look at yourself today, and you say, am I who I thought I would be?
[time=3288] You know, I just as I closed today, I want to just talk to you men who are 40 or 50 or 60 years of age.
[time=3300] Men who I would speak to with the respect that I should have for a father and elder.
[time=3307] But I want to ask you a question. As we work through those lists of character qualities, is that you?
[time=3313] Is there a character deficit in your life? Do you struggle submitting to authority? Do you struggle keeping your word?
[time=3325] Do you find yourself impulsively controlled by your emotions? And then when your anger has exploded, you try to justify your behavior because your judgment is marred by your emotions.
[time=3338] You struggle with lust, behind the scenes, when nobody can see, is it out of control or raging fire?
[time=3348] And if I'm talking to you today, I want to invite you to repent. I want to invite you to change. I want to invite you to admit that.
[time=3361] You know, I think the tendency is for men like that to say, you know, if I was ever to admit that I had character deficit like that, it would be as if my wife and my kids would point at me and they'd say, see, see.
[time=3375] You aren't who you said you were. Finally, you've admitted it.
[time=3382] But my limited experience is that the exact opposite will happen. Now look at you and they'll say, I've never loved you more.
[time=3408] I hope you've been inspired by the music today from our sanctuary choir and orchestra and the duet from Maryland, Wong and Marsha, Richard.
[time=3416] Message today was a continuation of the series by our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
