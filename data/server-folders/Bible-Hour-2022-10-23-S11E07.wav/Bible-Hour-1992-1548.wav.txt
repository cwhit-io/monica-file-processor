[time=0] Well good morning and happy Resurrection Day. If we were in Russia this morning and in
[time=7] a church that worshiped the true and living God, the pastor would come to the pulpit and he would say Christos Voscrest which in Russian means Christ is risen and the people would all stand in rise and say "Vaistanovoscrest" which means indeed he is risen. Stay with us this morning as we celebrate the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=32] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which
[time=45] we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today we celebrate Easter. Today our Lord arose from the grave. How does that fact affect you? Is this simply another Sunday? Or is this a special time of celebration for you? Do you share the same enthusiasm that our Russian brother and will express as they worship today? As a part of today's program we will be sharing some of the great music of Easter and Pastor Moore will be sharing a special Easter message. We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of John. We will be looking in particular at chapter 11 verse 26. Our special music today includes the popular "Who Will Call Him King of
[time=87] Kings" by Susan Toyrax Stump and two numbers from the Sanctuary choir "Glorious
[time=93] Victory" and "Jesus Rings". Just before Pastor Moore's message, Scott Schindler
[time=99] will be playing "Easter Song" on the piano. As we prepare for our time of Bible
[time=105] study, let's join the Sanctuary choir and brass as they begin our Easter celebration with "Resurrection Praise".

[time=1159] Hello and welcome again to the Bible Hour.
[time=1166] We're so glad that you tuned in today.
[time=1169] Russell, this is a day when you just want to shout "Hellelujah" for this.
[time=1172] This is a great resurrection Sunday as we take this program.
[time=1175] Absolutely. It's Easter and Jesus said he would go to Jerusalem.
[time=1178] He'd be delivered to the chief priest, the scribes, and the elders.
[time=1181] He'd suffer many things, be crucified, but that he would rise again on the third day and he has.
[time=1187] Peter, we celebrate the risen and living Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1191] Also, we're not going to take much time on the insert today because we have a lot of music and the preaching is foremost here and we want everyone that's watching to be involved in our service.
[time=1203] I'd just like to tell you about two gift offers though that we have a book marker for your book that you're reading every day from the Bible Hour.
[time=1211] I want you to receive that. Just write us today. We appreciate the letters that we receive.
[time=1217] Not only asking for the gift offers, but prayer responses and requests that you give to us.
[time=1222] But write for this book marker from the Bible Hour today by just writing to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1235] Once again, that's the Bible Hour. 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1244] I've used it this week in my Bible. It's on my desk and it helps me keep track and also when I open the Bible up, I see the word Bible Hour on the ribbon and I'm reminded to pray.
[time=1256] And I hope you are praying for the ministry of the Bible Hour on a regular basis.
[time=1261] My mother's day is just around the corner and I mentioned to you last week that I found a book entitled God's Gift for Mothers.
[time=1267] A great book, it's all scripture that just tells us about the promises, the blessings, and the responsibilities of being a mother.
[time=1275] I'd like to tell you a little bit more about this booklet. Let's watch right now the video that explains this booklet and its entirety.
[time=1282] Mommy! Remember how safe you family is a child embraced by your mother's love. Now you can give your mom the security and peace of mind that comes only by knowing the Word of God.
[time=1298] God's Gift for Mothers is 100% scripture versus organized by topics so your mom can easily find the answer she's looking for.
[time=1306] Like how to build a life of prayer, how to have the joy of the Lord and how to overcome stress. Plus there's a special crisis guide filled with God's promises of encouragement and hope for those really tough times.
[time=1320] God's Gift for Mothers is attractively packaged in its own gift box, making it the perfect gift for your mom.
[time=1328] To order your mom her very own copy of God's Gift for Mothers, call 1-800-927-3436 right now.
[time=1346] I want to remind you once again that you can receive the booklet by writing or that is calling on the 800 number. It's 1-800-927-3436.
[time=1357] So I hope that you'll write away ahead of time of Mother's Day and get one of these books for your mother. She'll enjoy it so much I'm sure.
[time=1365] Again, we're going to go back to our live portion of our service pretty soon and listen to some great music about the resurrection of our Savior.
[time=1373] We're grateful for this opportunity to not only worship here at Black Hawk Baptist Church but to televised this service telling us of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1383] There'll be more music coming up and then the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore. Stay tuned.
[time=1403] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=1563] [APPLAUSE - 10 seconds]
[time=1591] Good to be alive this morning, isn't it? You know, all across America people are celebrating the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1606] And it's a great day to do it but I've always felt and all my years through all the days of going to church on Easter Sunday there was something missing and I'd like to see if we could change it this morning.
[time=1616] Since Russia has opened up to us and told us a little bit more about their people and how they do things, we have learned that on Easter Sunday the pastor of the church will walk up to the podium and he will say, "It's in Russian, let me look."
[time=1630] He will say, "Kristos vahskres." And that in Russian means Christ is risen. And the people stand to their feet and with one loud response say this, "Vaistano vahskres, indeed he is risen."
[time=1645] And then he says it again and they answer and he says it again and they answer and it's almost like being at an IU basketball game and we're winning.
[time=1652] You get my drift. That is the feeling of resurrection Sunday. So we need to try this, all right? It may flop, we may never do it again. It may really be nice. We'll try it again next Easter. But you give me your best effort, will you?
[time=1664] Here's what we'll do. I'm going to walk up to the podium in a minute and you pretend I never had this conversation with you. We'll kind of think we've been doing this for years.
[time=1671] And I'll go up to the pulpit and I'll say he is risen to live and you take the last word live and say this and he lives in my heart. And then I'll say he is risen to rain and you take the last word rain and say and he rains in my heart.
[time=1689] And then I'll say he is risen to be worshiped and you say and he is worshiped in my heart. And then I'll say worthy is the lamb and you'll say worthy is the lamb and then I'll try to preach. How's that sound?
[time=1702] Are you ready? We've never had this conversation. Scott just finished and in your mind you're still clapping. Here we go. Let's try it.
[time=1709] He is risen to live. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Only a couple of you did this right. There's only a few people standing. We're going to try this again. Thank you, Arlen Friesen. You're all supposed to stand up and then say and he lives in my heart. It's a good first effort. I'll be right back.
[time=1736] All right. He is risen to live. He is risen to rain. He is risen to be worshiped and he worshiped in my heart.
[time=1756] Worthy is the lamb. Worthy is the lamb. Amen. Give yourself a hand. Thank you. I've been waiting 33 years to do that. That feels like Easter to me. I don't know about you. We're so excited. You're here this morning.
[time=1775] A lot of you come only a couple of times a year. You come on Christmas morning and you come on Easter morning and I want to compliment you on your choice of Sundays. Those are the two best Sundays in the world to attend church.
[time=1789] In fact, of the two, the best is Easter. The best Sunday in the world to come to church is Easter. In fact, I think it is the most important day in the entire year. I'll go so far to say this. I believe that the first Easter, that first Easter morning when Jesus rose from the dead is the most important day since the world began. Amen.
[time=1818] You guys better slow down on that collaborative stuff. I'm going to think we're not in a Baptist church anymore. This is fun. The reason I say that to you is because today, at least the first Easter Sunday and today is the day that we celebrate the resurrection of a man by the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=1838] And really, from speaking this morning to you who come typically on Christmas and on Easter and I wish that we could get away from the crowd this morning and go down to Ernie's and sit over a cup of coffee and ask and answer questions about Easter. What in the world? Why is why is all of America in the church is today crammed as we are even here in this auditorium celebrating and setting aside the remembrance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=1867] And if we were at that table over at Ernie's, I would just give you the freedom to ask any question you'd want and I'd do my best to answer them for you. But because we can't do that, I've posed three questions that maybe you would ask if we were sitting there. Let me give them to you.
[time=1881] What is the importance of the resurrection? Question number one. Question number two, how can I be sure that the resurrection really happened and it's not just a myth?
[time=1894] And the last question you might ask is will there ever be another resurrection? Will there ever be another resurrection? I'd like to just spend a few minutes with you this morning doing my best to answer those three questions for you. What is the importance of the resurrection? How can I be sure the resurrection happened and will there ever be another resurrection?
[time=1914] Question number one, what is the importance of the resurrection? Here it is. In the resurrection, Jesus Christ proved to the world that He was, who He said He was, that He is, who He said He was.
[time=1930] Some people want to say that Jesus was a nice religious man and He was a nice man and He was religious, but that's all they want to say about Him. They want to say He added up to being a nice religious man.
[time=1941] Other people want to say He was a great philosopher or a great thinker or a great teacher and leave it at that.
[time=1949] Other people want to say that He was a philanthropist, a do-gooder, He was nice to children, He cared for the poor, He helped the sick, but leave it at that.
[time=1958] The problem with those understandings of the person of Jesus Christ is that that is not what He said He was. He never once thought of Himself as a nice religious man, a great philosopher, thinker or teacher or a do-gooder or a philanthropist.
[time=1971] Do you know what He said about Himself? Do you know what He said He was? He said He was God. Jesus Christ, a real living human being, at about the age of 30 years, came into public ministry and began telling people that He was God.
[time=1987] The Son of God. And He went beyond that. He made a statement that He's even maybe more difficult to believe. He said not only am I God, but I am the only way to salvation.
[time=2000] I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man comes unto the Father but by me. This is a very staggering statement that He makes.
[time=2010] We are not left with the option of classifying Him as a religious man, a great philosopher or a philanthropist. He gives us an incredible statement about Himself, the Son of God and the only way to salvation. You say why should I believe Him?
[time=2025] Why should I believe Him? How do I know He's not lying as so many other religious people do just so they can get people to come into their auditoriums and give money and so they can get rich as we see a lot in our day and age and remember. How do I know He's not lying? That's an option.
[time=2039] How do I know He's not a lunatic? Maybe He really believed that He was God and that He was the only way to salvation. The only problem was He wasn't playing with a full deck. The elevator didn't go all the way to the top. He was insane. He didn't have control of His faculties. He honestly believed that He was God and the only way to life.
[time=2054] The only way to life, eternal. He was just nuts. You know how you can know? Well, He said something else. He didn't just say He was God and that He was the only way to salvation. He said this in Matthew 16.
[time=2068] I am going to Jerusalem and when I get to Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders and the scribes are going to take a hold of me and try me and then they're going to crucify me and on the third day I will rise again.
[time=2083] That's exactly what happened. Jesus Christ went to Jerusalem. He was delivered over to the chief priests, the scribes and the elders. They tried Him. They found Him blameless. They could find no fault except that He said He was God and that He was the only way to salvation. And for that they said He blasphemed. They crucified Him. They put Him in a grave and on the third day, guess what? He did exactly what He said He would do. He rose from the dead.
[time=2110] The resurrection is God's communique. The resurrection is God's memo. The resurrection is God's attempt to communicate with you to prove to you beyond a shadow of a doubt that this man in fact was not a liar. He wasn't a lunatic. He really was who He said He was. He was God and He is the only way to salvation and He proved it.
[time=2128] By saying He would die on crucifixion He did. He said He'd rise again. He did. Communication is tough sometimes. I remember the most exciting process of communication I've ever been involved in. I used to live in California. We were in the Los Angeles Coliseum. It was a pack day just like it is today here in this auditorium.
[time=2145] There were 93,000 people watching my favorite football team, the University of Southern California Trojans. Play football. And it was a custom in our family to go to these games. We kind of come from that school as a family. And on this particular Saturday afternoon, we did not have seats together.
[time=2161] My parents were sitting directly across the stadium from me. And I didn't know exactly. I couldn't find them but I knew I had their seat number in row. And so at halftime, I got off from my seat and I went around the other side.
[time=2172] And I started hunting them down. I came down the row and there was a seat. I was mom and dad. Hi, mom and dad. How are you enjoying the game all that stuff?
[time=2178] And at the end, I said, hey, what do you say? I'm sitting about right over there. What do you say, as soon as the kickoff in the second half is over, we try to find each other because we both had binoculars. And they said, great idea.
[time=2192] So I go back over to the thing and I sit in my chair and Heidi's sitting next to me and the game and the kickoff goes and that was our cue to start looking for each other.
[time=2201] So here I am with my binoculars looking at some 20,000 people trying to find my mother and my father on the other side of the huge coliseum.
[time=2210] And I'm scanning row by row. I figured I'll just do this by a process of elimination. And finally, I come down to this aisle and there is my dad standing up in the middle of the aisle doing this.
[time=2223] And I go, oh, it's my dad. And I stand up out of my chair and I go, oh, of course he can't hear me. And everybody around me thinks I've had too many beers.
[time=2240] And in there, you see now my mom, she's sitting down watching and suddenly she sees me doing this and she reads, blah, blah, I think she said this, blah, blah, sit down. So Bob sits down and I sit down and now it's me and mom.
[time=2254] And we know if we move our binoculars yet an inch, we've got a different 20,000 people in view. So we're frozen. We're locked. We've got each other. We are communicating.
[time=2266] And now we see how refined we can do this. So I go like this. And she goes, oh, oh, baby, we're doing it. And then I, that was my arm move. Then I tried my hand move. Boom. And she goes, boom.
[time=2285] And then the all time, all time, just the pinkies. Ha! And sure enough, pinkies back. And there was a thousand people watching a football game, but it was me and mom communicating across the Great Traverse.
[time=2301] God is trying to communicate with the people of the world. And as the people of the world, as you put on the binoculars of life and you scam the horizon and you're looking for meaning and you're looking for purpose and you're looking for a reason to get out of bed in the morning.
[time=2321] Here's Jesus standing next to an empty tomb going, oh, I'm here. I came back from the dead. Look, I rose. Jesus Christ is saying as loudly and as clearly as he can. I came with some ridiculous statements about myself.
[time=2341] I ate like a human being. I slept like a human being. I got tired like a human being. I talked like a human being. But I was really God in the form of human flesh. I am. I am the life. I am the resurrection. I am the living water drink from me and you shall never thirst again. I am the bread of life. Eat of me and you shall never hunger again.
[time=2360] And people are wondering why in the world should I believe the little boy from Nazareth? One reason. He said, I am going to Jerusalem. And when I get there, the chief priest, the scribes and the elders are going to give me a trial and then they're going to crucify me but on the third day I'll rise from the dead. And he did.
[time=2381] That is God's communication. That's the best way he knew to give you a sense of assurance that you could trust Jesus Christ.
[time=2392] If you take those same binoculars and you look over the landscape of religions and if your binoculars happen to come to the tomb of Buddha, guess what? He's still there. It's occupied.
[time=2406] If your binoculars move over a little bit and catch Confucius, you'll find him still in his tomb. If you move over a little more and you catch a glimpse of Muhammad, you'll find his tomb is also occupied.
[time=2422] If you glance a little different direction and find the tomb of Charles Darwin, the one who espouses the religion of our day in evolution, you'll find him still in the grave.
[time=2434] But Jesus stands next to his grave, waving his arms in a desperate attempt to catch your attention and say, wait a minute, I'm different than all the other religious leaders in the history of the world.
[time=2447] I was a good man, I was nice to the poor, I did help the sick, I was a teacher, I was a philanthropic person and a philosopher, I was all those things, but you know something, I'm God.
[time=2460] And I proved it to you by my resurrecting from the dead. You say, wait a minute, how can I be so sure that the resurrection happened? Question number two.
[time=2472] How can I be sure that he actually rose from the dead? I want to give you three reasons, I believe you can believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.
[time=2482] Number one, the Bible says he did. The Bible is the best-selling book in the history of the world, it's been translated into more authors and given to more languages, excuse me, into more languages than any other book, it sold more copies than any other book.
[time=2494] The Bible says, as you read in the responsive reading that Mary Magdalene and the other Mary on the first Easter morning went to look at the tomb and when they got there, instead of finding the stone across the opening, they found that the stone had been rolled away, an angel was sitting on top of it, the Roman guard who had guarded it had fell on the ground and looked as if he was dead and the angel said, I know who you come looking for, he is not here.
[time=2517] Those were two real people talking to an angel sitting on a stone looking at an empty tomb, the Bible tells you that he rose from the dead. But you're saying, hold it now, the Bible was written by the people who loved Jesus and who followed Jesus and if he said he was going to rise from the dead, then it only makes sense that they would write it up as if he did.
[time=2536] Let me give you another reason I think you can believe in the resurrection. Historians tell us that the most powerful historical evidence is what they call positive evidence from a hostile source.
[time=2548] I'm talking about historians that function in universities and have doctrines and look back through time and try to figure out what really happened and did it really happen and which account is the most accurate.
[time=2558] And when they fight through all the historical data that is presented to them, all the writings of the peoples and the letters and all the rest, when they fight through it all, the stuff they put the most weight on as far as determining whether it really happened is the stuff that people who were opposed to the movement said about it, a hostile source.
[time=2577] If one is openly antagonistic towards something, something in history and yet they say something affirming about it, then whatever they say about it would be the most genuine fact of history.
[time=2588] Do you know who was most opposed to the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Jewish authorities?
[time=2593] The Jewish authorities were threatened by Christ, they had tried on repeated cases to crucify him or to kill him in various ways and the thought of his resurrecting would have wiped out their entire system of faith or belief.
[time=2606] They were threatened to the core, but you can study history and you'll not find one of them in early ancient history who denies the tomb being empty the first Easter morning.
[time=2618] In fact, instead of denying it, they don't write, it wasn't empty, he was really there because they couldn't deny it because he wasn't there and thousands of people saw it.
[time=2627] The only thing they could do was try to give a different explanation for the empty tomb.
[time=2632] And so they said, "Oh, his disciples stole it. Somebody stole the body, but that doesn't make any sense."
[time=2640] The disciples, 10 now 11 men, put their entire life in the hands of Jesus Christ and they did it for the same reason I want you to do it is because he rose from the dead.
[time=2651] He's the only reason to follow Jesus. If Jesus didn't rise from the dead, forget it.
[time=2656] There's nobody to follow. And so here are 11 men who have put their whole life in the hands of Jesus Christ because he said he would raise from the dead.
[time=2665] Are those guys going to go steal his body and perpetrate a lie?
[time=2673] It wasn't just some business to them. They had based their eternity on the fact that he would rise from the dead.
[time=2680] One of these Jewish writers, Flavius Josephus, first century Jewish general in historian, known for his open antagonism against the Christian faith, records in his book Antiquity of the Jews, the empty tomb.
[time=2694] The fact that Jesus rose from the dead. Here's a hostile source saying it fact it happened.
[time=2703] The Roman officials were also threatened by Christ, especially if he rose from the dead. There was only one God in the Roman Empire, and that was the Emperor himself, and Jesus saying, "I'm God of everybody, and the whole universe, and I'll prove it to you when I rise again the third day, and the Roman authorities were adamantly antagonistic to the resurrection of Christ."
[time=2723] It so happens that the provincial governors of the Roman Empire, these men that would govern big territories of the Roman Empire, were required to submit a report at the end of every year to their Emperor called an acta, A-C-T-A, an acta, and in the acta they had to record the events of significance that occurred in their province in the last 365 days.
[time=2744] In one of the actas presented to the Emperor, Tiberius, the trial of Jesus is recorded, his crucifixion is recorded, and his empty tomb is recorded.
[time=2756] Hostile sources affirmed the tomb was empty. Jesus rose from the dead. Professor Thomas Arnold, that contemporary historian, the author of the three great volume work on the history of Rome later appointed to the chair of modern history at Oxford University wrote this.
[time=2775] "I have been used for many years to study the histories of other times and to examine and weigh the evidences of those who have been written about them, and I know of no one fact in the history of all mankind which has been proved by better and fuller evidence of sort to the understanding of a fair inquiry than the great sign which God has given us that Christ died and rose again from the dead."
[time=2800] Canon Westcott, a professor in scholar at Cambridge University, also given his life to studying the history of events, says this, "Indeed, taking all the evidence together, it is not too much to say that there is no historical incident better or more variously supported than the resurrection of Jesus Christ."
[time=2819] You want to talk about the resurrection purely on a human level, purely on an academic level of studying the history of events if you can believe that Alexander the Great conquered the world at the age of 21, you can believe that Jesus rose from the dead.
[time=2835] If you can believe that King John signed the Magna Carta, you can believe that Jesus Christ rose from the dead. If you can believe that Columbus discovered America, none of these great historical events can be proved any more strongly or conclusively than the fact that Jesus Christ rose from the dead.
[time=2856] It is an historical event, you can count on it, you can believe it.
[time=2862] The first reason I suggest you can believe in the resurrection is because the Bible says so. The second reason is because great historians, men who aren't even Christians, are forced to conclude that it did happen.
[time=2876] But there's another area of reasoning that I want to bring to your attention and that is your own internal witness, the thing that's going on inside of you. The Bible says that everybody in the world is created with the awareness that God exists and that they have sinned and violated that great God. There's a guilt inside of you. There's a guilt inside of me.
[time=2896] That's your own internal witness that you need to save you. You need Jesus Christ to have rose from the dead because if you don't, you die in your sins.
[time=2906] What are you going to do with the guilt? What are you going to do with the failure in your life that you haven't loved as you ought to have loved him? Maybe you've never committed adultery or murdered somebody or stolen from a bank, but you know your life, you know your sin, you know your failures.
[time=2920] There is an internal witness according to the Bible inside your heart that tells you you have violated the true and holy God and that you will be held accountable. Believe in the resurrection. The Bible says it happened. Historians say it happened and there is an internal witness in your heart that says, "Boy, I sure hope it happened. I need it to have happened."
[time=2944] Or, "I'll die in my sin." Well question number three, just as we come to a close this morning. Will there ever be another resurrection? Answer? Yes. There's going to be another resurrection.
[time=2958] You say, "Who's going to be in it?" Everybody. Everybody in the world is going to be resurrected. John 529 says this, "All who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, the voice of Jesus Christ and they shall come forth."
[time=2973] A day is coming when though you may have died physically and you'll have your body stuck in a coffin underneath some ground and your body will begin to decompose or maybe you had your body burnt up or maybe you were dropped into the ocean or maybe the body was blown up in a bomb in some war but the day is coming when all the bodies in the tombs and all the bodies that were blown up and scattered to the four winds of the earth are going to hear the voice of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is going to say, "Come forth."
[time=3001] And the power of Christ is going to bring those dead bodies back together and they will stand before Him.
[time=3009] And some of those people are going to be given life eternal. There's a resurrection unto life and they will share forever in the bliss and the wonder of heaven.
[time=3020] Others of those people are going to be given judgment. They're going to be held accountable for the sin in their life and for the fact that they rejected the communicate of God and the person of Jesus Christ and His sacrificial death to forgive those sins.
[time=3036] All of us will be resurrected. Buddha is going to be resurrected and he's not going to come out talking about his great religious work, the three baskets.
[time=3046] Confucius is going to be resurrected and he won't come out talking about the anilex and Muhammad will not come forth talking about the cumeron.
[time=3055] In fact, I believe with all my heart if those men could stand here today before you, they would say this, "believe in Jesus Christ."
[time=3063] He is who He said He was. It's the Son of God. He's the only way to salvation and He proved it on the first Easter morning.
[time=3077] Nothing causes us to think about death than the loss of a loved one. Nothing causes us to think about death more than the loss of a loved one.
[time=3087] And I believe that if your relatives who may have died without Christ could come back. If your grandma and grandpa who maybe didn't know Christ as their personal Lord and Savior,
[time=3096] if they could come back with the love they have for you, they would plead with you to accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3103] There was an event recorded in the Bible, John chapter 11, Jesus was called to a grave, the grave of Lazarus. He had known Lazarus.
[time=3110] He had known Lazarus. He had been a good friend and standing next to him was Lazarus's sister. Lazarus had been in the grave for four days.
[time=3118] The decomposition of his body would have already begun. He was sealed up in a grave and a big stone had been rolled over at much like the one that Jesus had been in.
[time=3127] And Martha was upset with Jesus because he should have gotten there sooner so his brother wouldn't have died and Jesus could have healed the sickness before his brother had died and been put into grave.
[time=3139] And she was upset and she was letting Jesus know that and Jesus looked over at her and said, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[time=3148] He who believes in me shall live even if he dies.
[time=3154] And then he said to her, "Do you believe this?" And she said, "Yes, Lord. I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[time=3165] And Jesus told the men standing by to roll the stone away from the grave.
[time=3170] And they all reacted and said, "Hey, wait a minute, don't do that. He's been in there four days. It's going to smell bad. We don't need that."
[time=3177] And he said, "Roll the stone away." And they rolled the stone away. And Jesus said, "Lazarus, come forth."
[time=3184] Lazarus heard the voice of Christ even though he had been dead for four days and he responded to the power that resides in the person of Jesus Christ because he is God.
[time=3194] And Lazarus came out of the grave. They unwrapped the wrappings off his body and embraced each other.
[time=3204] One last question.
[time=3207] I want to know if you can hear the voice of Jesus Christ calling you this morning.
[time=3212] Is there anything going on inside of you?
[time=3216] Is there anything going on inside of you to give witness and testimony that Christ is who he said he was?
[time=3225] He rose from the dead.
[time=3228] "Can you be sure that the resurrection happened? If you can believe in Columbus, you can believe in the fact that Jesus rose from the dead."
[time=3237] And I want to say that the contemporary movement that says there's life after death is right. The movies are coming out. Ghosts and flatliners and all the rest.
[time=3246] They're saying there's life after death. They're right. The Bible has been saying that for centuries.
[time=3251] They're wrong when they say that it's some type of undefined existence.
[time=3257] Everybody comes back from the dead. Everybody will hear the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ. Everybody will break forth out of the tomb and stand before him and he will ask one question.
[time=3267] Do you believe this?
[time=3270] I am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me shall live even if he dies. Do you believe that?
[time=3284] A great Russian lecturer, a member of the Communist Party, was addressing a packed audience in the Soviet Union on the subject of the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[time=3294] He spoke a considerable length of time trying to discredit the resurrection, trying to say it didn't happen.
[time=3302] At the end, the simple pastor in the audience rose to his feet and asked if he might give a reply. And the man in charge says, "Well, yes, but only mind you. You can only have five minutes."
[time=3316] The pastor said, "I only need five seconds." The pastor stood up, faced the crowd and said, "Christas Voschress." The crowd responded in one roaring thunder, "Vaistano Voschress."
[time=3334] Christ is risen from the dead. Indeed, He is risen. Will you pray with me?
[time=3345] Father, we're thankful for the opportunity to live in this country where we can worship, where the doors of our church can be open, where we fear no persecution from police or governmental authority, where we can bring the talent and resources of our church together to do the very best we can do to somehow say we're thankful for the resurrection and for what it means to us as people as individuals.
[time=3369] Father, we want to take one more step this morning and I'll ask all of you to bow your heads and close your eyes even as you are and keep them there. I want to ask you a very serious question.
[time=3380] One more question this morning. I'm not going to give the answer. I need you to give the answer. I need you to answer this question.
[time=3388] The people of this church who regularly come here have been praying for you, you who we knew would celebrate Easter with us. We didn't know your name.
[time=3397] We've been searing with you some wonderful resurrection music from our sanctuary choir, solo a Susan Stump and an instrumental number by Scott Schindler on the piano.
[time=3411] The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, what a wonderful day it would be to just bow right now and ask God to come into your heart.
[time=3425] Let's pray that prayer together. Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3434] Because of his resurrection, I know that I can ask forgiveness of my sins and ask you to become my Savior today. Come into my heart, Lord, in Jesus name my pray. Amen.
[time=3448] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
