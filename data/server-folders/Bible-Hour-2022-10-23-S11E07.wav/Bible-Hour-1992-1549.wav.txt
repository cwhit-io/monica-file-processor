[time=1] Satan is a liar.
[time=3] There is no truth in him.
[time=6] When he speaks, he speaks lies because it is his nature to lie.
[time=10] Satan hates the truth.
[time=12] Satan wants to do everything he can to perpetrate lies and falsehood against the truth.
[time=18] But standing in opposition to the lies of Satan and his world system is the church.
[time=23] And we note from our text this morning that the church of the living God is the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study,
[time=45] music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=49] Thank you for joining us.
[time=51] Day by day, week by week, we have a choice.
[time=55] Shall we stand for the truth?
[time=57] Or will we allow Satan to spread his deceptions?
[time=60] Though the answer should be obvious, today we will carefully examine just what God's word has to share with us on this very important topic.
[time=70] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy.
[time=75] We will be looking in particular at chapter three verses 14 through 16.
[time=81] Our special music today includes the sanctuary choir singing my glory all the cross and just before Pastor Russ's message, Karin Sikafus will be singing and he's ever interceding.
[time=93] As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's join the congregation as they sing that great old hymn and can it be.
[time=117] [MUSIC - 132 seconds]
[time=255] On the fourth verse together, [MUSIC - 63 seconds]
[time=327] Continue with our hymns in hand, please, as we turn to 182 into the response of reading there, and glory in the cross, which is in preparation for the choirs' medley of songs on the cross.
[time=340] Number 182.
[time=342] And Jesus answered them saying, "The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified." Father, glorify thy name.
[time=350] There came therefore a voice out of heaven.
[time=353] I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
[time=356] The multitude, therefore, who stood by and heard it, were saying that it had thundered.
[time=362] Others were saying, "An angel has spoken to him." Jesus answered and said, "This voice has not come for my sake, but for your sakes." Now, judgment is upon this world.
[time=374] Now, the ruler of this world shall be cast out.
[time=377] And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.
[time=382] But he was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which he was to die.
[time=388] And he found that in the earth is his man.
[time=392] He found that himself might have become disobedient to the point of death.
[time=397] To begin the death on the cross.
[time=400] Therefore, also, that I have not exulted him.
[time=403] And he stole on him the name, which is of every name.
[time=408] Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfector of faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=421] But may it never be that I should boast, except at the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
[time=439] (Pomp and Circumstance) [MUSIC - 209 seconds]
[time=660] - Welcome to the Bible Hour today.
[time=667] We're coming off the heels of a great week celebrated Easter week here at Black Hawk and around the world.
[time=673] An event that is obviously the high point in the life of a Christian as we realize that Jesus Christ died for us, rose again to give us eternal life.
[time=683] I hope that theme is a part of your life throughout this entire year.
[time=687] While we're coming up on May and May is Missions Month here on the first part of the month at Black Hawk Baptist Church, we'd like to tell you about some events that are taking place.
[time=696] On May 3rd, we'll have a children's musical entitled "Go ye into all the world." The King's Kids Choir grades one, two, and three.
[time=704] We'll present this musical.
[time=706] We've had musicals in the past and they've had a profound effect on people, children have that way of doing that.
[time=711] - That's really true.
[time=712] Just even last month, we had a children's musical called Salvation Celebration.
[time=717] And at the end of the evening service, unprovoked really a man came up to me and said, "I'd never understood salvation in that light before "as the kids had presented it, both through song and dialogue." And he said, "I need to accept Christ as my Savior." And later that week, we got together and he did that.
[time=733] - That's marvelous.
[time=734] We want to give you that date again.
[time=736] It's May 3rd, at 6 p.m. here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=740] "Go ye into all the world presented by the King's Kids." And then we'll continue with the Missions Emphasis and have a Missions Night on Sunday evening May 10th.
[time=750] We'll have the King's Men's Quartet from Cedarville College and Cedarville, Ohio.
[time=755] And also some of our missionaries are going to be home for that evening.
[time=757] - Well, we're going to be highlighting the family.
[time=759] We have two families, the freezing family and the Elliott family that have been missionaries for Black Hawk for years and years.
[time=764] And in the process, even on the Missions Field, have raised godly kids who are now many of them a part of our church, a part of our church family.
[time=771] So we're going to have them all there and ask questions about raising families and under some of the difficult circumstances even on the Missions Field.
[time=779] Once again, that Missions Emphasis will be on Sunday evening May 10th.
[time=783] And then we continue with a lot of exciting events as we go to May 17th on Sunday evening.
[time=789] Russell, tell us about that.
[time=790] - Well, there's this guy named Dr. John MacArthur who, as you know, Pete has had a huge influence in my life and he's going to be in the area.
[time=797] And with us for the evening service on May 17th at 6 o'clock.
[time=801] And we'd love for you to come by and be ministered to by John MacArthur as he preaches the word.
[time=807] - Right.
[time=808] Dr. MacArthur is on the radio around the United States.
[time=811] He's the pastor of the Grace Community Church in Panorama City, California.
[time=815] And we look forward to his ministry with us on Sunday evening May 17th.
[time=822] And then this will be the last day that we offer to you this book marker.
[time=826] You can put in your Bible.
[time=827] It also has the name of the Bible hour and the address.
[time=830] And as you open your Bible to read every day, I hope that you'll take the time as you see the Bible hour logo to pray for the Bible hour in its ministry.
[time=839] You can receive this book marker absolutely free by writing to the Bible hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=851] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=860] And I'm equally excited about this booklet that we're offering on the Bible hour for Mother's Day in particular. It's called "God's Gift for Mother's."

[time=968] We're going back to the live portion of our service now as we listen to more music.
[time=972] And then the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=1002] [MUSIC - 258 seconds]
[time=1280] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1287] Amen, thank you, Chorene, beautiful song about the intercessory ministry of the great high priest, Jesus Christ.
[time=1296] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and open them to the book of 1 Timothy chapter 3.
[time=1303] We resume our study of this one of the pastoral epistles as Paul is writing to his disciple in the faith Timothy.
[time=1311] And today we come to the mission of the church itself to be the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=1318] Let me read verses 14, 15, and 16, you follow along.
[time=1322] I am writing these things to you, hoping to come to you before long.
[time=1326] But in case I am delayed, I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God,
[time=1332] which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=1337] And by common confession, great is the mystery of Godliness.
[time=1341] He who was revealed in the flesh was vindicated in the spirit beheld by angels proclaimed among the nations,
[time=1348] believed on in the world and taken up in glory.
[time=1352] This is a passage all about the truth and the church's role to be the pillar and support of the truth, even as it says at the end of verse 15.
[time=1363] I grew up in a place called the San Niz Valley, which was a coastal inland valley just over the mountain range that separated us from Santa Barbara.
[time=1372] We were probably 30 minutes from the ocean and our valley was about 15 miles long and about 7 miles wide.
[time=1377] And it was a beautiful place to grow up and rolling hills and oak trees and all the rest.
[time=1382] And it was when I moved there, when I was about 10, relatively undiscovered by the masses of Los Angeles.
[time=1388] But it has since become somewhat of a place where famous people go and buy property and build houses.
[time=1395] Michael Jackson now has a ranch there and Bo Derek has a ranch there and Jimmy Conner's lives there and a whole bunch of other people that are relatively well known around the world.
[time=1405] Also a man by the name of Ronald Reagan had a ranch there.
[time=1409] In fact, when you heard of him going to Santa Barbara to vacation at his ranch, it was really the San Niz Valley.
[time=1416] It was the back side of those mountains that separate us from Santa Barbara.
[time=1421] The San Niz Valley also cradles a little city called Solvang, which is an entirely Danish community.
[time=1428] Its architecture is restricted by city ordinance to be exactly that of Danish architecture as it would be in Denmark.
[time=1434] Many of the people who founded the city and who still live there are 100% Danish.
[time=1438] My brother-in-law is 100% Dane.
[time=1440] He was at one time the mayor of that city. It's a quaint place. It draws about a million people a year in tourist attraction.
[time=1447] And so those of us who lived there as locals were constantly interfacing with these tourists who would come through and want to see the site.
[time=1454] Remember one day there was a tourist that pulled into a gas station there in the San Niz Valley just outside this little city of Solvang and filling up his car.
[time=1463] He said to the attendant, one of the locals that lived in the valley, he said, "Now, I hear President Reagan's ranch is somewhere around here. Could you direct me to that?"
[time=1472] I mean, where is that ranch?
[time=1474] And of course, the way they were standing, all the gas station that they had to do was point right there.
[time=1479] There was the mountain range and his ranch was up in the foothills of those mountains.
[time=1482] And instead, the gas station that said, "Oh yeah, I know where President Reagan's ranch is. It's right over there.
[time=1489] Just take this street right here, head on down there for about 10 miles, you'll come to a science," says President Reagan's ranch.
[time=1495] "Absolutely lying to the man." And I don't know if that doesn't characterize our day and our total utter disregard for the truth.
[time=1505] That man, and I'm not calling him in any Christ or some type of demonic person, but he really reminds me of Satan.
[time=1512] Satan is in the business of telling lies. Satan loves lies. Satan hates the truth.
[time=1519] And when people who are lost and confused in this world raised their head above the rubble of their life long enough to ask where the celebrity is,
[time=1527] and sometimes they're wondering where Jesus is, Satan loves to be right there and point them in the absolute opposite direction.
[time=1535] John 844 says that Satan does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature.
[time=1543] He is a liar and the father of lies.
[time=1546] He has engaged a full-fledged battle and war against the truth. He hates it when it is preached. He hates it when you live it.
[time=1554] He hates it when we stand for it. He hates it when we present it to the unbelieving.
[time=1559] And so he has a system, a world system that's described over in Ephesians chapter 6. I'll just remind you by quickly reading it to you.
[time=1567] It is our struggle, not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness,
[time=1574] against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[time=1578] Satan is the monarch of this world. He is the ruler of this age and he uses everything he possibly can to disseminate and propagate and prolificate his lies.
[time=1589] Through the television, I believe he is in charge of that. He is the CEO of all of the stations that exist in one form or another.
[time=1597] He is in charge of the press and what comes out in our newspapers. He is in charge of the press and what comes to us by way of written form in books.
[time=1607] Not to say immediately and directly, but his world order and his false system of thought and his lies have found their way so deeply into our culture that it all just promotes his falsehood.
[time=1620] And in addition to that, it is greeted these lies by people who in fact themselves hate the truth.
[time=1627] Romans chapter 1 tells us that the unregenerate is actively suppressing and that word means to hold down the truth that is yelled to them from creation that there is in fact the God and that they are living in violation of his truth, his absolutes.
[time=1642] So the unregenerate of this world are in the process of suppressing the truth and therefore the wrath of God is upon them and God turns them over three times in that chapter, wants to basic immorality, heterosexual immorality.
[time=1656] He just turns them over to the lusts and the passions that fill their heart. They continue to suppress the truth. They continue to believe lies.
[time=1663] They continue to lift themselves up as wise all the while becoming foolish and so he turns them over again to homosexuality and the perverse perversion of God's order for sexual relationships, men with men and women with women.
[time=1679] And they continue to suppress the truth and they continue to suppress the truth in their lives and so he turns them over again until they reach the absolute bottom which is a depraved mind, a mind without a mind.
[time=1690] That genuinely approves falsehood as truth. So Satan and the unredeemed are in a partnership for falsehood and deceit and lies and half truths.
[time=1703] And they delight in it but penetrating the darkness like a great shaft of light is the truth that comes into the world through the church.
[time=1714] We are all that stands between what we know today as some level of society and absolute chaos. What would happen if this church were removed from this city and all the other churches in this city that preach the gospel and stand for the truth?
[time=1730] And what would happen to this nation of all the churches like that were lifted and even from all the nations of the world that the church were instantly taken out?
[time=1738] You know what you have on your hands? The great tribulation. That's what's coming. That's what's next in God's program for the world.
[time=1746] We are what stands between some semblance of law and order and respect and dignity for human life and absolute chaos that is coming at the end of this age.
[time=1758] It is our responsibility to be the pillar and the support of the truth. And this passage outlines for us three distinctives of the truth.
[time=1768] Verse 14, Paul's passion for the truth. Verse 15, God's plan for the truth and verse 16, Christ's personification of the truth.
[time=1779] Look at verse 14, he says, "I am writing these things to you hoping to come to you before long." Paul was always hoping to be with his saints. Paul was always praying. He was never ceasing in his prayers. He was always remembering these fledgling little New Testament churches, which were the only light in a decadent and depraved society.
[time=1800] He was, at this time, we believe not in Ephesus where Timothy was and the church to whom he is writing here. He was in Macedonia across the Aegean Sea some five or six hundred miles. We don't know what he was doing. He was probably with the Bereans or the Thessalonians having some kind of ministry with them. But his heart was back at the city of Ephesus because he knew that that church was in trouble.
[time=1822] Paul had spent some three and a half years there giving his greatest deposit of truth to those particular believers in that city and Satan had found himself a mighty sledgehammer and he was using it to beat against the very foundations of the church.
[time=1836] You say what was the sledgehammer? Men, men who had come to leadership in that church who were not qualified and who were not godly. Ungodly men rising up in these little house churches all over the city of Ephesus and they were in effect in the hands of Satan the great and mighty sledgehammer that was pummeling the truth of God as Paul had brought it to them.
[time=1857] The blow that he first brought against the church at Ephesus was the very gospel message itself and he was using these men to pervert it by speaking myths and endless genealogies.
[time=1868] They were spinning lies and fabricating falsehoods that were mitigating against the very gospel the simplicity of the truth of Jesus Christ.
[time=1877] And all their teaching came to was mirror speculation rather than the administration of God which is by faith. And so as Satan wields these ungodly men in his hands and just picks blow after blow after blow against the very gospel itself, the life giving message of salvation by grace through faith, Paul feels compelled to write.
[time=1898] And in so doing, he exposes them. He says, "Him and ass" and Alexander in chapter 1 verse 20 are among the men that Satan is using. He exposes their false ungodly untrue teaching and calls them men straying from things. They turn to fruitless discussion.
[time=1917] They make confident assertions about which they know nothing and then he affirms by the testimony of his own life, the grace of God that came into his life even though he too had persecuted the church and attacked the gospel.
[time=1932] So the first blow that Satan bears against the church are through these ungodly men in their polluting of the gospel.
[time=1941] But these men don't stop there. He uses them to attack even Timothy himself and so we know that several places in this book, Timothy is needing encouragement, Timothy is needing to be lifted up and strengthened and reminded of his calling.
[time=1954] In chapter 1 verse 19 he says, "At the end of verse 18, fight the good fight, keep the faith and a good conscience which some have rejected and suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith."
[time=1966] Satan loves to tear down the men of the truth and he often times uses ungodly men who pose as men of the truth to do that and that's what these men were doing.
[time=1975] Many of them were likely older than Timothy, they may have been more gifted than he, they may have held higher positions in the community, they may have had a stronger personality but they were taking blows, heavy blows at his character and his ministry and his sense of well-being and he was faltering in the ministry.
[time=1994] So the gospel is under attack, the men of truth is under attack and the people themselves are confused and that's what we found in chapters 2 and 3.
[time=2002] They lost their sense of organization and understanding of even the purpose of the church itself and so Paul in chapter 2 verse 1 calls them back to making in treaties and prayers and petitions and thanks giving that they should be made on behalf of all men.
[time=2016] He says, "Let me remind you you exist as a church to evangelize the world. It is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior that men should come to the knowledge of the truth."
[time=2028] So they have lost their sense of purpose and their sense of organization and under the trauma of the attack of these men and their false doctrine and their charges against Timothy, even the women in the church are assuming they should take a role that is not theirs, they weren't built for it, it wasn't given to them by God.
[time=2045] Probably also influenced by the pagan rituals in their very city, the women were taking positions of authority and they were teaching and that is against God's pattern that is not the way it's supposed to be inside the church.
[time=2058] In fact that is the role and the responsibility of the men and so he reminds them of that and calls them back to being learners and faithful servants inside the church of God.
[time=2070] He then lifts up a template of character to be comparing against these false teachers, these false prophets in what we know as the qualifications for an elder and does the same with deacons and deaconesses or deacons wise.
[time=2085] So he is passionately engaged in the preservation of this church at Ephesus as Satan is delighting and destroying and tearing it apart and tearing it down and ruining the entire church.
[time=2099] Paul never ceases to amaze me, his passion for the people. You can hardly open any book that he has written in the entire New Testament and not find him consumed with their spiritual well-being, he is constantly praying for them, they are the reason he exists.
[time=2114] In a chapter over in 2 Corinthians Paul kind of gives a description of his labors, his imprisonments, his being beaten, his danger of death, his lashes, the rods that have come against him, the ship rexies survive, the dangers he's been from journeys and countrymen and robbers and the Gentiles and he just goes on and lists off this horrendous calamitous event of trying to share the gospel of Jesus Christ and to communicate the truth and he finally comes to the end of that.
[time=2143] And then he says, "But apart from all that external stuff, apart from such external things, there is daily pressure upon me that concern for all the churches."
[time=2153] He carried it with him night and day, he slept with it, he awoke with it, he ate with it, he traveled with it, it was constantly the burden of his heart and his life that the truth should be preserved through the New Testament church.
[time=2166] Satan hates it, Satan hates the truth and when leadership is absent he moves in with a greater vengeance than before to try to tear it down.
[time=2178] I remember my sister having scored relatively highly on some of those academic tests towards the end of high school and she had an interest in medicine and so she decided to be a doctor and enter into a pre-med, you know, major in school.
[time=2192] So BYU was selected as the place of higher learning and off she went with great expectations and hopes.
[time=2200] And the phone calls started coming back and every week they were slightly different but they began to evidence a pattern.
[time=2208] One week she would be happy as she could be, she would have had friends that she never thought possible and a level of acceptance that just amazed her and she felt so loved and so included.
[time=2217] And then the next week she called back and she was crying and she felt isolated and distanced and nobody cared about her and didn't know who she was or how she fit into that particular community.
[time=2226] And then the next week it was the opposite, loved and cared for her again.
[time=2229] And the next week and sometimes it would be a couple of weeks in between the calls but it became obvious that what was going on in this hot bed of disbelief and of polluted doctrine and of polluted gospel and of a polluted promise of salvation.
[time=2243] She was working her with a science and a discipline and she was beginning to break down into the pressure of an environment that did not preach or hold or stand through the truth.
[time=2255] She began to question her own faith.
[time=2258] She began to wonder if salvation was really through grace, through faith.
[time=2262] She was wondering if maybe some of the teaching of the Mormon church wasn't the question.
[time=2266] Thinking about marrying a Mormon boy, she began thinking about being married in the Mormon church and all that that would mean by way of recanting her true faith in Christ and then entering into that church and ascribing to the doctrine therein.
[time=2278] And that was just about all my folks could handle after careful deliberation they brought her home midterm.
[time=2286] They cared about her truth even though she'd been raised in a Christian home, she'd gone to Christian grammar school, Christian high school, too much exposure to the lives of Satan in a society and a culture designed to propagate the falsehoods about Christ and about eternal life.
[time=2303] And even this bright young girl trained in the things of Christ began to waver and as my folks should have they protected her from that and brought her home.
[time=2314] Paul had a tremendous passion for the truth and I just would wonder the level of passion in your life even this morning for the truth in your kids life and in your own life.
[time=2324] Your love for the truth, your commitment to the truth and therefore your commitment to even this church which stands unequivocally for the truth and has since its inception.
[time=2334] Well verse 15 he goes on to explain God's plan to disseminate the truth, to protect the truth, to guard the truth, verse 15 but in case I am delayed I write so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God.
[time=2347] In other words he's saying I'm not just giving you all this as some long list of ecclesiastical do's and don'ts that stand out there as theological doctrines dangling in the air about men and about women and about elders and about deacons and about praying for the lost.
[time=2361] This is all to work together so that each one of you individually would know how to conduct yourself inside the household of God which is the church of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.
[time=2371] What he's saying is if we are going to properly support the truth and stand for the truth this organization is necessary.
[time=2378] This blueprint for organizing the internal structure of the church is somehow in the wisdom of God a mandate and requirement for us to effectively stand for the truth.
[time=2389] He uses two very interesting words here the pillar and support of the truth the pillar the dominating architectural structure in the city of Ephesus that would have filled these people's minds as they read this letter would have been the temple dianna which as we've noted is one of the was one of the seventh wonders of the ancient world and it was it was surrounded by 127 pillars it was the dominant theme of the temple as far as its visual perception.
[time=2418] These pillars these 127 pillars were built constructed of marble there were gorgeous expensive heavy lavish gorgeous pillars and many of them were studded with jewels many of them in addition to just the raw beauty of the marble itself were then studded with all kinds of expensive jewels and some of those have been given by kings from afar who wanted to have their name associated with this seventh wonder of the world.
[time=2447] And so Paul calls us as a church to make beautiful or to make ornate to make attractive the truth that we stand for to show the beauty and the wisdom and the grace of truth in our lives and I I believe we do that as we build godly families as we show the order and the truth of God for the husband and the wife relationship and how children are to line up under that authority and obey and submit and honor and reverence their parents and the.
[time=2475] The believing world looks at that and says man I wish my family were that way I wish I wish I don't know what you guys have but I wish we had that in our household.
[time=2485] There's a great joy for us to move on to a new street back in California and we had our three kids and it was a matter of time before three or four of the ladies on that block had approached Heidi and said I don't know what it is about your kids I don't know what it is about your family but you guys are different and she had opportunity to share and give glory to the gospel.
[time=2504] Of Christ because of the difference because we tried to make the truth attractive that's what we do as a church.
[time=2514] But in addition to that we are the bowl work or the buttress of the truth you see it there the support of the truth right there at the end of verse 15 that word is completely different than pillar this is the one that makes a strong this is the one that makes a stand firm.
[time=2528] This is the word that describes our absolute conviction and the truth of God despite what an ungodly culture tells us.
[time=2536] As a church we are ones who may identify with the unwed pregnant teen who isn't ready to have a baby who doesn't want a baby who knows her life will never be the same if she does have a baby.
[time=2551] And we can identify with her natural response to never have dreamed the kinds of consequences after a fling on a Friday or a Saturday night to be this severe and this traumatic and how she may naturally think about an abortion as a quick solution.
[time=2566] We can identify with that we can understand that our heart can go out to her in that predicament but we do not waver on the fact that abortion is murder.
[time=2574] We stand against that we stand against an entire secular society that is promoting otherwise in every possible avenue it tells us that abortion is not sin abortion is a right and it's not a right it's a matter of life and death.
[time=2590] But we are responsible as a church not just to stand for the truth as a bull work or as a buttress against the blows of Satan as he would try to tear down the dignity of human life through these thousands of abortions every month or every week or every day in our country.
[time=2605] We not only stand against that but we we are called to beautify that true we are called when found in the presence of one of these young ladies to do more than just tell her that sin don't do that and slam the door on her.
[time=2619] We would beautify the truth as we invite her into our home and say there's a place for you here we're committed to you.
[time=2626] We want to help you move through this process in your life and have this baby and see this through and if adoption is the best option they will help you put the baby in that kind of circumstance and see it into a good home and if keeping the baby is the best option and even marrying the person who is the father in this situation we're with you and we'll stay with you and we'll help you and we'll put flesh and bones and beauty to the truth of God as he stands against murder and abortion.
[time=2652] We're required to do both it's not enough for us just to say it's wrong we've got to put shoe leather to it and be involved.
[time=2662] We can identify with the homosexual who is longing for intimacy who is longing for a level of acceptance and companionship and who finds it most freely given in relationships with the same sex.
[time=2676] We can understand the longing for intimacy we can understand the longing to be accepted we can understand the longing for companionship but we are not as a church going to bow the knee to a secular society that says that homosexuality is an alternative lifestyle that it's acceptable that it's just a choice that it's not a moral issue that it's that it's a possibility in the realm of what would be normal natural human relationships it's unnatural it's not normal it is a perversion.
[time=2705] And we'll continue to stand there but at the same time we must beautify the truth to those who have been caught up in it and are losing their lives to the disease that goes with it.
[time=2714] Where would be our attempt to garnish the truth with the beauty of the grace of God to offer and extend forgiveness and to eat with that homosexual homosexual in the workplace and to be noted as a friend of that homosexual and to be noted as one who cares for that person and is willing to spend time and invest a life.
[time=2737] We must both pillar and support the truth. We live in a day that says divorce is just another option that there's nothing wrong with divorce and while we can identify with the couple who are fighting like cats and dogs and really have no fellowship and no sense of community and no sense of mutual support of one another and that that stuff died years ago in their marriage and they come to you 10 or 15 years later exhausted by the trauma of having to live with each other.
[time=2766] And they say our love is gone and all hope for our marriage is lost and to stay in this marriage would be asinine it would be ridiculous it would be horrible it would be counterproductive nothing ever could come out good from staying in this particular marriage.
[time=2784] We need to seek a divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences we've got to move on we've got to face we just can't make it and there's a reasoning to that that sounds compelling but it's not God intended for a man and a woman to marry each other and stay married and pure until they die.
[time=2802] And though there are some notable exceptions in the word of God where a biblical divorce may be granted where there has been adultery or where an unbelieving partner may leave that certainly is a far cry from what our culture is telling us about divorce.
[time=2820] So we've got to beautify that truth we've got to beautify that truth we've got to be involved in the couples lives in our church who are near divorce.
[time=2830] We've got to note them and plug in and uphold and strengthen their life take them into our homes if need be invest ourselves there so that it's not just some rigid thing no divorce.
[time=2845] It's God's design is no divorce how can I help make sure that never happens in your home what do I have to do I heard of a man the other day almost brought fact it did bring tears to my eyes who was involved with another couple who had been struggling and were very close to divorce and that man and his wife said we will do anything we have to do and they meant it we will do anything we have to do to help you put your marriage back together for the glory of God.
[time=2874] You know what that kind of stuff only happens in the church when the church functions like that to a society that is suppressing the truth holding it down actively suppressing it and is being fed a monstrous flow of lies through every conceivable avenue from the prince of lies.
[time=2903] We make a difference we do our job we stand for the truth.
[time=2913] Well where do we stand we stand on the truth of verse 16 by common confession great is the mystery of godliness he who was revealed in the flesh was vindicated in the spirit be held by angels proclaimed among the nations.
[time=2931] Believed on in the world and taken up in glory this is Jesus this is Jesus and he is the personification of the truth he said I am the truth I am the truth capital T.
[time=2944] This is a hymn by the way verse 16 scholars believe is a hymn from the early church to one of the first they may have written it isn't an adaptation of something out of the book of Psalms or some Old Testament song.
[time=2956] I mean this would have been a chorus or a verse and one of their favorite hymns and it is selected I believe by inspiration and by the design of Paul to say that in a passage all about truth while Paul has a passion for the truth and the church is to be the pillar and support of the truth that is Jesus Christ and no one else who is the foundation of the church on which these pillars and this support rests.
[time=2978] He is the ultimate truth that the church has to offer he is in fact all the church has to offer it is Jesus Christ the truth of one look at these six stanzas just briefly this Jesus who was revealed in the flesh none other than the son of god the second member of the Trinity taking the form of human flesh and as we saying this morning emptying himself of all but love taking on the limitations of the human body.
[time=3004] Of space and time so that he could evidence the character of God in a way that humans could understand.
[time=3012] Secondly he was vindicated in the spirit and we just celebrated that to the best of our ability last Sunday vindicated or endorsed by the spirit of God went on the third day he was raised from the dead and proven beyond any question or shadow of a doubt to be the son of God to be who he said he was.
[time=3029] He was beheld by angels they were always in his life at key moments it's interesting how the Lord punctuates how God punctuates the Lord's life with the presence of angels they were there at his birth they were there at his baptism they were there at his temptation they were there at his crucifixion and they were there at his resurrection.
[time=3048] Just wonderful angelic messengers affirming and praising and worshipping and serving the true and living God.
[time=3057] And then it says that he is proclaimed among the nations and believed on in the world and I love this they're already singing this when they get together they sing this truth about Jesus revealed in the flesh and vindicated in the spirit and be held by angels and they just keep on singing as if it has already happened he's been proclaimed among the nations he's been believed on in the world.
[time=3077] And that hadn't even happened yet this is maybe 30 years after the ascension of Christ and it's not a global message yet Jesus hasn't gone out into all the nations of the world.
[time=3089] He hasn't been believed on yet by the people and all these nations around the world but they know it will be it'll happen the same Jesus who said in the great commission to go into all the nations and make disciples and then died and proved his authority to give them to do that by his being raised from the dead.
[time=3106] And that's that power that will take us eventually to the ends of the earth with the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=3112] So they were already singing anticipating that that would happen that though to date it hadn't it certainly would and then they rejoicing the fact of his ascension taken up in glory.
[time=3126] He is the bedrock on which the pillar and support of the church stands to buttress the truth.
[time=3137] You know I was thinking about the leaning tower of pizza as I was reflecting on this passage and so I checked in a little bit it's eight stories high.
[time=3145] They started building it in 1174 and it took them 200 years to complete because shortly after commencing work they found that the ground was unstable.
[time=3154] And it began even from its inception to lean.
[time=3157] They did little to support it it has a foundation and only ten feet deep which isn't much for us building that goes eight stories in the air and the foundation itself is only the circumference of the building.
[time=3170] It doesn't go beyond it's just straight down into the ground.
[time=3174] By the 1950s it was leaning 17 feet off of perpendicular and it continues to lean a quarter of an inch more every year.
[time=3183] It's in trouble and they're developing plans to take the thing down and build a better foundation and reconstruct it.
[time=3192] And I'm thinking you know that's some of you today.
[time=3195] Some of you are leaning you're you're telling and you've been doing that really since your inception it's just becoming more obvious every day.
[time=3204] You really don't have much of a foundation.
[time=3207] It may be the pearls of wisdom that your parents gave you in fact you may be trying to live your life in the opposite way that your parents did.
[time=3214] You may find your foundation from some school teacher that really stands out in your mind as a great man and you're trying to follow in his ways or you may be seeking your foundation of truth and your understanding of the world through some book or some author or some approach or some philosophy.
[time=3231] And all I can tell you is I don't know where you got it but I know wherever you got it it was only an intermediary source.
[time=3239] Satan is behind it all. If you have any other foundation any other foundation other than the bedrock of the person of Jesus Christ this one described in verse 16 you have a foundation that has been subtly given to you by the master of falsehood.
[time=3257] And you may beginning to see the evidences of the faulty foundation as your life begins to tilt as your relationships begin to crumble as your sense of meaning and purpose in life begin to evaporate and what seem to use to mean so much means now so little.
[time=3273] And the way your family is being raised and the things that are happening there in are very concerning to you.
[time=3280] Life isn't working and I'll suggest that you check your foundation.
[time=3289] Couldn't check into the leaning tower of pizza without checking on the Sears tower. It goes 110 stories high not eight but 110 1400 feet straight up.
[time=3301] You know what's underneath it huge columns of steel that are driven down through the earth until they rest on rock.
[time=3312] And if they don't didn't find rock and are certain parts of the building then they built huge gigantic basements of steel and cement.
[time=3319] There is enough cement underneath the Sears tower to build an eight lane highway that would go for five miles.
[time=3328] You'll notice it's not leaning. It's standing strong. Where are you today? Do you have your feet on the rock?
[time=3340] Peter said thou art the Christ the son of the living God. And Jesus said upon that confession of faith upon that rock I will build my church.
[time=3350] And all I can say to you today is I'm thankful that we stand together as Black Hawk Baptist Church. And I'm concerned that we both buttress the truth and adorn the truth.
[time=3363] And I guess my challenge to you this morning who are standing on the Word of God you're standing on Jesus Christ.
[time=3369] You know him you love him is this I want you to think about the people in your life and maybe identify one person, one person who has been duped by Satan who is themselves suppressing the knowledge of the truth that you can beautify their your understanding of the truth of Christ in their life.
