[time=0] motherhood in America has fallen on hard times the mothers of America are
[time=6] involved in aborting their children abusing physically emotionally and mentally their children they're sitting their children off today care centers as they pursue a career and fulfillment in some other way of living the word of
[time=21] God calls women back to the role of motherhood and that's what we'll do by looking at first Samuel chapter one in the life of Hannah.
[time=33] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we
[time=48] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. In today's secular society, mothers are mostly considered second-class citizens, careers, individual choices, personal satisfaction, all are considered to be more important than just being a mom. It is no surprise that God presents a different view than society. Stay with us today as Pastor Russ studies the life of Hannah in a message he has entitled "Profile of a Godly Mother." We suggest that
[time=78] you locate your Bible and have it open to the Old Testament book of first Samuel. We will be looking in particular at chapters one and two. Our special
[time=87] music today includes the handbell choir playing the Church's One Foundation and just before Pastor Russ's special Mother's Day message the Blackhawk Christian School's speaking choir will present Beatitudes for mothers. As we prepare for
[time=102] our time of Bible study, let's join the sanctuary choir in orchestra as they present the song entitled "Marveless in Our Eyes."
[time=135] [MUSIC - 252 seconds]
[time=405] [APPLAUSE]
[time=411] Very powerful words in that song as you listen to the second verse and you talked
[time=417] about we talked about the fact that he left us the instructions through the word of God and the Holy Spirit and then maybe we be worthy craftsmen as we wear our
[time=427] children an awesome responsibility that we have together. Continue to tell our children and those around us of the stories of Jesus so they'll have them on their heart. 172 please. We'll sing the first and third stances of 172.
[time=444] [MUSIC - 314 seconds]

[time=1364] If you go back in our history to the early part of the century, you can read some very interesting tributes to mothers. And they give us some insight into the country's perception of the role and the importance of mothers in that day. William L. Caldwell in 1928 wrote this,
[time=1382] well may we praise, excuse me, well may we pause to pay honor to her who after Jesus Christ is God's best gift to men, mother.
[time=1392] It was she who shared her life with us, when as yet our members were yet unformed. In the valley of the shadow of death she walked that we may have the light of life.
[time=1403] In her arms was the garner of our food and the soft couch for our repose, there we nestled in the hour of pain, there was the playground of our infant glee, those same arms later became our refuge and stronghold.
[time=1419] It was she who taught our baby feet to go and lifted us up over the rough places, her blessed hands plied the needle by day and by night to make our clothes.
[time=1429] She put the book under our arm and started us off for school, but best of all she taught our baby lips to list the name of Jesus and told us first the wondrous story of a Savior's love.
[time=1441] He went on to say, the pride of America is its mothers.
[time=1446] There are wicked mothers like Jezebel of old, there are unnatural mothers who sell their children into sin, there are sin cursed, rums soaked and abandoned mothers to whom their motherhood is the exposure of their shame.
[time=1460] I am glad to believe however there are comparatively few in that class.
[time=1467] Few, few unfaithful mothers, few sin stained mothers, few shameful mothers, maybe in 1928 but not so few today, what is the state of motherhood in America today?
[time=1488] Our mother is still the pride of this land, millions of abortions, millions of divorces, a quarter of all the babies being born into illegitimate situations where they will have no home and no family as God would have intended.
[time=1507] Millions of battered and abused children by the anger of their mothers, the only thing really left in mother's day, at least culturally, across the land, would be the commercialism tied to it, and lately it is perpetuated not by mother lovers but by money lovers.
[time=1527] Marriage is desecrated by our culture, parental responsibility is shirked, children are massacred in abortions, mothers exercise selfishness and in paralleled way both at work and in their play with little regard for their children whom they ignore.
[time=1544] This morning as we gather at this church in this place, we will reaffirm motherhood and the place of motherhood not because it was dear and near to us years ago as a nation but because it is part and parcel to the plan of God to advance the kingdom of God to exalt the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1563] Paul said to Titus, older women are to encourage the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be sensible, pure workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands that the word of God may not be dishonored.
[time=1583] If you'll come with me this morning to first Samuel, we'll revisit a mother who I'm sure you've thought about on previous mother's day but we'll highlight her life again by way of rekindling and reinforcing and reinvigorating the place of the mothers of this church and their commitment to the great and glorious task to which God has called them.
[time=1609] We'll look at Hannah and the profile of a godly mother, the profile of a godly mother and to do that we'll look at her circumstances, then her character and then her child, her circumstances, her character and her child.
[time=1624] Hannah had the unfortunate lot of being born into the nation of Israel at probably its darkest hour.
[time=1632] She lived at the age or the end of the age of the judges, that was a 200 year period of Israel's history that continually got darker and darker and blacker and blacker as the people gave themselves to idolatrous worship with each new generation.
[time=1647] They were a disobedient people, they were in rebellion against God, they had apostasized, they had left the true in living God and they were worshipping the false gods of the Canaanites.
[time=1657] Their nation as a culture was full of compromise, moral compromise, disobedience and it was rampant with sinfulness.
[time=1665] It is captured by the phrase in judges 21, 25 that everybody did what was right in the sight of their own eyes, it was absolute utter lawlessness and to nominism there was no regard for the truth of God's word or God himself.
[time=1679] As a result the nation was full of corruption, unparalleled corruption and there was oppression from neighboring and even foreign armies who would come as the chastening hand of God would allow to call the people in some way back to repentance, it was a decadent day, it was dark.
[time=1698] The leadership of the nation was equally decadent, Eli was the high priest, he was a fat obese man who at points in his life expressed a heart for God but really had no heart for his children.
[time=1710] Hoffney and Finnehas were ungodly men, unruly men, you can read about them by turning the page to chapter 2, verse 12, "Now the sons of Eli were worthless men, they did not know the Lord.
[time=1724] Eli had turned the operation of the temple over to his two sons, Hoffney and Finnehas and they did not even know God, they weren't even believers, they were apostates in the true sense."
[time=1736] You say what was so horrible about what they did, verse 17, "Thus the sin of the young men was very great before the Lord, for the men despised the offering of the Lord.
[time=1747] When the people would come to the temple to express their faith and the true living God by this external outward religious system of offerings and sacrifices, there was a certain prescribed way for that to occur and without going into the detail of it, these two young men were snatching from the offering the meat that was to be offered to God and later given to the family but they stole it for themselves because they were indulging themselves."
[time=1771] As a result, the people of the land were reluctant to come to worship, knowing that it would be desecrated by the very men who were to lead in worship and so the leadership of the nation was also in desperate straits.
[time=1783] Back to chapter 1, you'll find another element, another part of swimming upstream for Hannah, she was married to a polygamist. She was married to a man by the name of Elcana, it says in verse 2, he had two wives, the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other Panina and Panina had children but Hannah had no children.
[time=1805] We're so often exposed to polygamy when we read the Old Testament we can come under the vague notion that maybe it wasn't wrong, maybe polygamy was alright, maybe that's what God had intended for that particular period of history, that's not the case, the Garden of Eden is very clear as God establishes its one man and one woman they leave and they cleave and they stay together for all their life.
[time=1826] All the polygamy you read about in the Old Testament is sin, all of it is against God's law, all of it is in direct violation to his will for the marriage and for the household.
[time=1836] God and His graciousness would continue to use men who had sinned in that way and continue to sin in that way but don't be misunderstanding God's intent against polygamy.
[time=1846] And it brought great hardship into her life, Hannah's life, there was rivalry in the household and that was really brought to the head by the fact that the Lord had closed Hannah's womb, verse 5.
[time=1857] The Hannah he would give a double portion for a loved Hannah, speaking of the offering, but the Lord had closed her womb, verse 6, her rival however, would provoke her bitterly to irritate her because the Lord had closed her womb.
[time=1872] For reasons that we don't fully understand, the Lord had not allowed her to have children.
[time=1878] And that as you might suspect even in our day is a very difficult reality for a woman to bear up under, but in that day it would have been even more so.
[time=1887] A woman's complete and total identity was built upon her child bearing capacity and when that was not able to be done she was even viewed as being cursed by God.
[time=1897] God was raising up the nation of Israel as a great and awesome number of people to live in a peculiar way before him so that all the other nations of the world would look and say see they had the right God.
[time=1908] And part of that was the fruit of their womb, part of that was the fertility of the wives and their ability to give offspring and so large families were typical and expected.
[time=1918] And when a woman would not have children she was viewed as somehow having a curse from God.
[time=1924] In addition to that, just think as most women would when they cannot have children, your whole sense of use, fullness and your validity as a human being can be snatched from you and you say what am I all about then?
[time=1937] Even as a man might when he cannot have a job, when he loses his job and finds himself out of employment if he's fired or just can't cope.
[time=1945] There's a real sense of desperateness there wondering about myself image who I am, why did God bring me onto the planet? These are the questions that flooded hand his mind and they were constantly being provoked by this bitter irritation which came to her from her husband's other wife, Panana.
[time=1963] She was in difficult straits. She was in a hard place. Those were her circumstances.
[time=1971] Secondly, they were corrupt. The leadership was corrupt. She was married to a polygamist and the Lord had closed her womb.
[time=1979] It's really hard to anticipate or even conjure a more difficult circumstance for a woman to live in.
[time=1986] But that brings us to our second point and that would be her character.
[time=1989] And I want to highlight a few elements of her character as they're revealed to us from verses 9 and following in chapter 1.
[time=1995] First, her prayer. Then, Hannah rose after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now, Eli, the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the temple of the Lord and she greatly distressed, prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly.
[time=2010] And as you would read the entire account of her life, you'll find that she prayed to God instead of what so many other times we are tempted to do in this particular type of situation.
[time=2022] You find no handmade being brought to him so that he could have children through her substitute or through her surrogate wife or partner as we have seen in the patriarchs which was sin and was wrong and has brought turmoil now through the centuries into the Middle East as it happened.
[time=2039] She didn't bring a handmade. She didn't bring retaliation against Panana. She didn't allow the anger in her heart to grow to a place that she would have potentially murdered or slandered Panana.
[time=2049] She also did not retreat into pretense saying it doesn't matter if I don't have kids. I'm okay without kids. Everything's fine in my life without kids and embark on some long trail of denial, pretending that what she really wanted. She didn't want.
[time=2061] She has a most godly response. It impacts her deeply. It says in verse 10, she was greatly distressed. She was aware of it and she took it to the Lord.
[time=2070] She went bitterly before the Lord. She understood that he was a sovereign God. That children are a gift from the Lord. That it's not merely a human problem with some part of her anatomy. It is ultimately the will of God in her life.
[time=2083] And so she went to that God time and time again. Verse 12, now it came about as she continued praying. It appears it was her pattern to do that over and over and over again because she understood that God was the source of children.
[time=2098] So deeply impacted by her unmet longings, by her situation, by her culture, by her day, instead of being manipulative, instead of being vengeful, instead of retreating from the whole situation into denial, she bears the reality of her life and she brings it to her God in prayer.
[time=2116] So she is a woman of prayer. Secondly, she is a woman of promise. Look at verse 11, she made a vow and said, "O Lord of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy maid servant, and remember me, and not forget thy maid servant, but will give thy hand made servant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life and a razor shall never come upon his head."
[time=2140] That is, of course, the vow of the Nazarite, only two other men in all of scripture have been devoted to the Nazarite vow from their inception, Samson, John the Baptist, and Samuel.
[time=2152] And what she is doing here, I believe, in making this vow, and as you know the rest of the story, as soon as she had weaned him, she took him off to the temple.
[time=2160] In other words, she gave up the right and the privilege and the joy of bringing that young boy back into her home and living there in the presence of Panina and Alcana, and saying, "See, I have my own part of this family, I have my own way to function."
[time=2174] And it really reveals that the motive in her heart was being stripped as she is in the refiner's fire of these difficult circumstances, and she's beginning to tie her motive and her goal for this child into the real reason why the nation of Israel was raising up a godly seed, and that was to be wholly devoted to the Lord and to proclaim the knowledge of the true and living God.
[time=2193] She's saying, "I'll forego the privilege of motherhood as far as the enjoyment of it on a day-to-day basis. I'm asking now for a son who could be entirely devoted to you and to your work, the motive in her heart is being refined and purified."
[time=2209] It's evident she wants nothing from the boy by way of showing him off or parading him, she is simply seeking now to contribute to the kingdom of God.
[time=2219] In verses 13 and following, you'll find another of her character qualities kind of hidden there.
[time=2225] Verse 13, "As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart." She's praying there. Only her lips were moving, but her voice was not heard.
[time=2233] So Eli, the eye priest, thought she was drunk. Apparently a man of great discretion who cannot determine the difference between a woman who is distressed and her soul and a woman who is drunk.
[time=2242] Verse 14, "Then Eli said to her, 'How long will you make yourself drunk, put away your wine from you?' But Hannah answered and said, 'No, my Lord. I am a woman oppressed in spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the Lord.'
[time=2259] Do not consider your maid servant a worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation. The word worthless in verse 16 is a really interesting word that gives us insight into her character.
[time=2274] In Deuteronomy 13, the same word is used to describe idolatrous people.
[time=2279] In 1 Samuel 2, the chapter following, it describes rebellious people. In judges 1920, it describes people involved in luge sexual behavior.
[time=2290] In 1 Samuel 25, it describes arrogant and stupid people. In 1 Kings 21, it describes the murderer.
[time=2299] And she's saying, 'Don't group me with those kinds of people. Don't think that I am in that category. I am not a worthless woman. I am a woman of purity. I am a woman who has reserved herself to her husband and to her God. And now in the midst of my distress, I am still committed to him even though it hurts to be that way.'
[time=2319] In other words, Hannah did not play spiritual adultery with the idol. She was not an idolatrous woman. She did not say, 'Well, if God can't give me the son I want, then I'll worship another God and maybe he can.'
[time=2333] She was not a woman of rebellion. She did not come out in vengeful, spiteful anger against panana or against al-Kana or shake her fist in the face of God and say, 'You are a lousy God. And I want nothing to do with you because you can't even give me the simple request of a son.'
[time=2351] She was not a woman who amidst her pain would have involved herself in lured sensual activity as some women in our day do when their life is bored and their life is unfulfilling and they don't get what they want. They find the pleasant sin for a season in illicit sex.
[time=2368] She was not an arrogant woman and she was not a murderous woman. You remember the words of Jesus in Matthew 5 saying that if you're angry with a person, it's as if you've murdered them. She apparently guarded her heart from anger against panana and against God.
[time=2382] So she is a virtuous woman, a pure woman. She is not worthless.
[time=2388] I want you to notice also, she's a woman of patient faith, look at verses 17 and 18, then Eli answered and said, 'Go in peace and may the God of Israel grant you your petition that you have asked of him.'
[time=2400] Verse 18, 'And she said, 'Let your maidservant find favor in your sight.' So the woman went her way and ate and her face was no longer sad.
[time=2411] Her spirits were lifted, having received the promise of Eli that God would answer her prayer, she counted on that, she believed in that, she trusted in that. Her countenance was again lifted and she continued to eat as she had been having some trouble doing as the previous part of the passage reveals.
[time=2428] She trusted, she was willing to wait, she was willing to count on God to deliver her from this calamity and in the interim would find joy in her patient faith.
[time=2438] Lastly, and we'll skip ahead a little bit in the story, come to chapter 2, you'll find that she is a woman of praise, a woman of praise and you'll find in the first 10 verses of that chapter a song that she wrote, praising her God.
[time=2451] This is after God has given her her son Samuel and she gives him the glory, my heart exalts in the Lord, my horn is exalted in the Lord, my mouth speaks boldly against my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation.
[time=2465] There is no one holy like the Lord, indeed there is no one besides thee nor is there any rock like our God.
[time=2472] She writes a song of praise and honor and glory to the God, she is worshiped.
[time=2477] Look at the last verse, verse 10, "Those who contend with the Lord shall be shattered against them, he will thunder in the heavens, the Lord will judge the ends of the earth, he will give strength to his king and will exalt the horn of his anointed."
[time=2492] Really, here she parrots back Genesis chapter 12, verses 1 and 3 in the Abrahamic covenant and God's commitment to reach all the nations of the earth, to bless those who bless the nation of Israel and to curse those who curse the nation of Israel.
[time=2504] This is clearly in her thinking, adding up to the development of the kingdom of God.
[time=2509] More is in view here than her own personal need for a child, she is sold out, she is committed to the kingdom of God and what he is doing in the scope of redemptive history.
[time=2518] This is a godly woman. This is a woman of marvelous and powerful character, a woman of prayer, a woman of promise, a woman of purity, a woman of patient faith, and a woman of praise.
[time=2536] Well, what about her child? What did God give her? Chapter 1, verses 19 and 20.
[time=2545] Then they arose early in the morning and worshiped before the Lord and returned again to their house in Rama.
[time=2551] And Elkana had relations with Hannah, his wife, and the Lord remembered her.
[time=2556] It came about in due time after Hannah had conceived that she gave birth to a son and she named him Samuel, saying, "Because I have asked him of the Lord, Samuel means the name of God."
[time=2568] And I can't, in any way, shape or form begin in the time remaining this morning to describe in detail how God used this one life.
[time=2577] But let me give you a few highlights.
[time=2579] The nation had been so sinful, had been so rebellious, had been so idolatrous that in chapter 3, verse 1, it says the word from the Lord was rare in those days and visions were infrequent.
[time=2592] And God had closed up the prophetic line. He had stopped communicating with the people of Israel because they were so hard-hearted and so rebellious.
[time=2600] The word from the Lord was rare in those days and visions were infrequent.
[time=2604] They hadn't heard from God for who knows how long. They were just left to languish in their rebelliousness and their sin.
[time=2610] Until Samuel came along.
[time=2612] Samuel in this chapter 3 is a young boy. He has been left up at the temple to serve the Lord as his mother had promised she would do.
[time=2620] Here's the voice of the Lord in verse 4. The Lord called Samuel and he said, "Here I am."
[time=2626] God began speaking again to the nation of Israel through this young boy.
[time=2632] Finally in verse 10, then the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel, Samuel.
[time=2637] And Samuel said, "Speak for thy servant is listening." And the Lord said to Samuel, "Behold, I'm about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will tingle."
[time=2646] And he goes on to describe the marvelous thing that God is going to do.
[time=2649] It was this little boy Samuel, the one through whom God chose again finally to open again the word of the Lord of the people and to give visions and to communicate.
[time=2661] There was another day in his life when the Philistines had encamped against the Israelites and a great slaughter was eminent against the nation of Israel.
[time=2668] Samuel prayed to the God of heaven and said, "Give us help and God brought a thunderstorm that put the Philistines in total confusion." And they were routed that day by the prayer of this one boy Samuel.
[time=2680] As he grew up, he later carried the weight of the entire nation. He was their judge. He ruled in their land. He gave them justice. He gave them honor and integrity according to the word of God.
[time=2692] He was the one who brought Saul, King Saul, the first king of the nation of Israel in the power and took him out of power because Saul was an ungodly man.
[time=2701] He also was involved in the selection process of King David and presided at the coronation of the great King David.
[time=2708] Samuel was dedicated to service by his mother and he never deviated from that path. He was a faithful man of God to his calling all the days of his life.
[time=2719] He did not seek power for the sake of power but to benefit the people. He was a man of great counsel over and over again. He called the nation of Israel not to turn away from following the Lord but to serve him with all their hearts.
[time=2731] He was a man of submission. When these kings came to power, he submitted himself to them as God would have had it.
[time=2740] This is the picture and the product of a godly woman. Remember our study over in 1 Timothy, chapter 2 and following where it says that God does not have the women to preach or teach or exercise authority because it was Adam first who was created and then Eve and it was Adam who was deceived in the garden.
[time=2760] And the question remains if women are not allowed to lead the church, if women are not allowed to lead this incredible thing called the church of Jesus Christ and what will their contribution be.
[time=2771] Remember in verse 15 of chapter 3, chapter 2, it says that the woman is saved in childberry.
[time=2779] Her contribution to the kingdom of God is to raise up a godly seed and when she does that, men like Samuel come on the scene and save a desperate situation from utter destruction.
[time=2793] In many ways, America is very much like Israel. Israel was an idolatrous nation and so is America. We are a disobedient people. We are in rebellion against God. Everyone is doing what is right in the face of their own eyes and the mother is the one that must nurture and care for that young little Christian life so that he will, he or she will not be swept in the same cultural disaster of the United States of America.
[time=2822] Hannah suffered under ungodly leadership in Hoffney and Phenahaz which was 10 amount to their national leadership and the same would be true of the mothers of our day.
[time=2833] On a state and on a national level, our leaders are corrupt. They are ungodly. They have no concern for the word of God. They desecrate the sacred things of God in their judgments, in their law making, in their own personal lives and the mothers of this nation who would raise a godly seed.
[time=2851] We must do it in spite of them and in spite of the culture they promote and though ours is not a day of polygamy, our mothers are left to struggle with divorces and infidelity on the part of their husbands and though the husband may not divorce or be unfaithful, many of them are married to their job or to their hobby and to themselves and there is bitter rivalry in the home between the wife and that husband's hobby or job or pursuit of some career.
[time=2880] Their life is at a balance and to these women of America, to these mothers of our own church, we say from the word of God be women of prayer, be women of prayer, take your burden and your responsibility to the great god of heaven who will help.
[time=2900] And as your husbands even are disobeyed into the word of God even as 1 Peter 3 says when the husband is disobeyed into the word the women should win her husband with a chaste and respectable behavior, don't sink into the lower level of manipulation, to manipulate your husbands and to be conniving and scheming, don't disappear into the void of denial as if it doesn't matter, feel your hurt, feel your burden and take it to God and trust that he will help.
[time=2927] Be women of promise and though you would not be tied to the external Nazarite vow, know that in your heart you're raising a child, a son, a daughter, so that they can be used of God in whatever way he would choose, whether it's the mission field, the ministry or in some incredibly important business position or as a doctor or as a lawyer, but they'll have Christian character and Christian values and a godly outlook.
[time=2952] Be women of purity, don't be succumbed to fall into the idolatry of our age which isn't grave in images but is the materialism and the leisure and the pleasure and the self-consuming, self-absorbing, introspective attitudes that many of the women of this nation are consumed with themselves, resist the rebellion, the sensual conduct, the arrogant attitude and the murder as anger that fills their hearts.
[time=2977] Be women of patient faith, wait on your God, he will not answer as soon as you would like and evidence your confidence in him as you wait with character and be sure to praise him for he has given you much in your husband and your church in this great land.
[time=2997] Proverbs 14 talks about the woman who tears down her own house with her own hands.
[time=3004] That's a great commentary of what's going on in the homes of America today. Women are tearing down their own homes with their own hands.
[time=3015] The young mother set her foot on the path of life. Is the way long she asked and her guide said yes and the way is hard and you will be old before you reach the end of it but the end will be better than the beginning.
[time=3030] But the young mother was happy and she would not believe that anything could be better than these years so she played with her children and gathered flowers for them along the way and bathed with them in the clear streams and the sun shown on them.
[time=3043] And life was good and the young mother cried nothing will be lovelier than this.
[time=3050] And then night came and storm and the path was dark and the children shook with fear and cold and the mother drew them close and covered them with her mantle and the children said oh mother, we are not afraid for you are near and no harm can come.
[time=3064] And the mother said this is better than the brightness of day for I have taught my children courage.
[time=3072] And the morning came and there was a hill ahead and the children climbed and drew weary and the mother was weary but at all times she said to the children a little patience and we will be there.
[time=3083] So the children climbed and when they had reached the top they said we could not have done it without you mother and the mother when she laid down that night looked up at the stars and said this is a better day than the last for my children have learned strength and the face of hardness.
[time=3100] Yesterday I gave them courage today I have given them strength.
[time=3105] And the next came strange clouds which darkened the earth clouds of war and hate and evil and the children grove and stumbled and the mother said look up.
[time=3115] Lift your eyes to the light and the children looked and saw above the clouds an everlasting glory and in it guided them and brought them beyond the darkness.
[time=3125] And that night mother talked of Jesus and said this is the best day of all for I have shown my children God.
[time=3133] And the days went on in the weeks and the months and the years and the mother grew old and she was little and bent but the children were tall and strong and walked with courage.
[time=3144] And when the way was rough they lifted her for she was as light as a feather and at last they came to a hill and beyond the hill they could see a shining road and golden gates flung wide and the mother said I have reached the end of my journey and now I know that my end is better than the beginning for my children can walk alone for they walk with God.
[time=3166] And the children said you will always walk with us mother even when you have gone through the gates to the savior and they stood and watched her as she went on alone and the gates closed behind her.
[time=3179] And they said we cannot see her but she is still with us a mother like ours is more than a memory she's a living presence.
[time=3189] I don't know how you feel about your mom but I want to talk to the kids in the audience for just a minute.
[time=3199] Proverbs 3011 says there is a kind of man who curses his father and does not bless his mother there is a kind of person.
[time=3209] I believe that one of the greatest indicators of your walk with God as a child will be your attitude your respect your genuine honor for your mother.
[time=3219] She is one of the authorities that God has placed in your life and she is authority that is soft and gentle and compassionate and kind.
[time=3227] I have heard words spoken from my own lips and from the lips of others about their mother that are shameful words and they reveal a rebellious heart and they are unpleasant in the sight of God.
[time=3240] Include in your evaluation of your love for God the way you treat, think and act towards your mother.
[time=3248] And to you husbands do you love your wives in a way that really promotes their being the kind of mother that God would have them be.
[time=3260] A woman finds most of her security in your love as her husband not your bank account not the fancy house not some accomplishment.
[time=3270] She will find her security her sense of well-being to the measure that she feels loved unconditionally loved and committed to by you.
[time=3281] That love ought to be demonstrated so often there is little question of it and it will free her up.
[time=3287] It will free her up from the pressures of our culture to be a beauty queen or to have some kind of physical physique or shape or to be involved in some type of dashing marvelous wonderful adventure.
[time=3298] Because she will be secure in your love and she will allow her life to be freely given to her children knowing that you love her unconditionally.
[time=3310] I guess we could all talk a little bit about our moms this morning I think of my mom and how thankful I am for her and in particular one dimension her commitment to my education.
[time=3321] I remember I was taken off to school at third grade we changed schools thirty five forty minutes away from our house and it was her practice to drive us there every single day because it was a Christian education that's what they wanted for us.
[time=3333] The first day I showed up I was supposed to have a notebook and I we didn't know that we didn't read it in the paperwork they'd sent us and so I was without my notebook and as little embarrassed about that my mom didn't say anything she just left.
[time=3342] Little while later at recess I looked in the parking lot there and there was my mom's car and she was in there doing something and when recess was over she walked up to me she got to the store and she got my notebook and she filled a full of paper and all the dividers were properly named according to my class and there was my little pencil pouch with my pens and my pencil sharpened and ready to go.
[time=3362] In sixth grade the teachers told my mom I wasn't learning very well.
[time=3366] So that summer my mom bought the McGuffee readers and we sat on the couch and she overcame my reluctant obstinate bad attitude every day as she read me through the McGuffee readers.
[time=3380] When I wanted to quit college my freshman year it was my mother's voice that came through with my father saying forget that word that's not acceptable in this house we don't quit go back to school but she didn't just say go back to school she began to help.
[time=3394] My mother typed every one of my college papers and every one of my seminary papers I never learned how to type in high school.
[time=3410] Mothers I hope you enjoyed the music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and our handbell choir and the special tribute to mothers from our readers choir.
[time=3420] The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.

[time=3431] Dear Heavenly Father I thank you that I can come to you and tell you of my needs and today I sense the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3439] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
