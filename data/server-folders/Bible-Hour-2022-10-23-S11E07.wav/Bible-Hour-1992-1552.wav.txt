[time=0] Is your pastor doing a good job, is he meeting your expectations?
[time=6] I would ask you this question, what standard are you using to evaluate his performance?
[time=12] The text we have this morning is 1 Timothy 4 and it's going to give us God's standard
[time=18] for the pastor.
[time=19] It'll explain God expectations for the man and the ministry, and in that highlight the good and excellent servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=40] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=46] Thank you for joining us.
[time=50] In the last several weeks Pastor Moore has been leading us in a study of church leadership, today he'll be looking at the particular office of Pastor Teacher.
[time=57] In today's business world, every job has a job description and a list of qualifications.
[time=62] Well, God did not leave us with a blank sheet of paper.
[time=65] He's left us with a very definitive set of expectations for the man and his ministry.
[time=70] We suggest that you locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy.
[time=75] We'll be looking in at chapter 4.
[time=79] Our special music today includes the sanctuary choir and orchestra singing and playing the majesty and glory of your name.
[time=86] And just before Pastor Ress' special message, whatever missionaries Jim Elliott will be singing "There is a Savior." As we prepare for our time of Bible study, let's join Brian Losen as he sings for the glory of the Lord.
[time=113] For the glory of the Lord, we have been created, living text of written word, and word,
[time=143] mercy demonstrated, we are made a channel where his grace is born, witness of salvation for the
[time=165] glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord.
[time=181] The glory of the Lord, willingly we suffer, laid upon this holy cross, dying with our
[time=199] brother, his divine fulfillment, our complete reward, crucified rejoicing for the glory of the
[time=220] Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord.
[time=291] Lord.
[time=319] The glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory
[time=509] of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord.
[time=535] For the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory of the Lord, for the glory
[time=888] for yesterday, for this must save you all, who lights our way.
[time=912] Are there burdens in your heart? Is your past a memory that binds you? Is there some
[time=925] pain that you've carried far too long? If that strength in your heart, with his good
[time=945] love, there is a safe you all, and he's forgiven you. There is a safe you all. What joy
[time=971] expressed his eyes are mercy, his word is rest, for each tomorrow, for yesterday,
[time=1001] there is a safe you all, who lights our way. There is a safe you all. What joy
[time=1024] expressed his eyes are mercy, his word is rest, for each tomorrow, for each tomorrow,
[time=1049] for today, there is a safe you all, who lights our way. There is a safe you all.
[time=1077] Who lights our way?
[time=1096] Amen. Thank you, Jim. Many of you know that
[time=1107] Jim is one of the missionaries that we support. He and his wife are looking to go back now to Guam and we've been praying for them and meeting with them and we're excited about how God is going to continue to use them for his glory even as he has this morning.
[time=1122] Well let me invite you to take your bibles and let's go back to the book of 1 Timothy. This
[time=1128] morning we come to a very, very interesting passage that is more about me than it is about
[time=1134] you. So often I stand up here and talk about you. Today I have to stand up here and talk about me and it comes with some level of tension in my own heart. This is a passage about
[time=1145] the minister of Jesus Christ. This is a passage about the good servant of Christ Jesus and it's really a checklist whereby you can evaluate my ministry, whereby the Lord will evaluate
[time=1157] my ministry and really whereby you can evaluate your own ministry as you are a fellow servant
[time=1163] of Christ. 1 Timothy chapter 4 verses 6 through 16. Let me read the passage so we can get
[time=1169] it in our minds. In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant
[time=1176] of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished on the words of faith and on of the sound doctrine which you have been following. But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness. For bodily discipline
[time=1193] is only of little profit but godliness is profitable for all things since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. It is a trustworthy statement deserving full acceptance.
[time=1205] For it is for this we labor and strive because we have fixed our hope on the living God who is the savior of all men, especially of believers. Prescribe and teach these things. Let no one
[time=1217] look down on your youthfulness but rather in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity. Show yourself
[time=1223] an example of those who believe. Until I come, give attention to the public reading of scripture
[time=1229] to exhortation and teaching. Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you which was bestowed upon you through the prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the Presbytery. Take pains with these things. Be absorbed in them so that your progress may be evident to all. Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things. For as you do this you
[time=1250] will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you. The key to understanding this
[time=1258] passage is in the phrase at the beginning of verse 6, "You will be a good servant of Christ Jesus." A
[time=1265] good servant. Two basic Greek words to describe or use the word "servant." One is do-loss and that's the
[time=1272] word that talks about a slave and submission to an owner or a master. That's not the word here.
[time=1277] This is the word de Achanas. It's also translated deacon as we saw earlier in our study of this book.
[time=1282] Here not the official place of deacon but the ministry of serving other people. He's saying here, "You will be a good servant. You will be a good minister. You will be a good slave of Jesus Christ as a pastor in that church if you do these things." The word "good" there could have been translated
[time=1298] noble or excellent or worthy. This is, you will be a worthy, excellent, useful man in the cause of
[time=1306] Christ. If you ascribe to, if you hold these as your goals, as your perspective, as the things to
[time=1313] which you are working in your ministry. It is a job description of sorts. It is a list of do's and
[time=1321] don'ts that the pastor should be faithfully involved in. Timothy, as you remember, was in a difficult
[time=1328] spot. Paul had left him in the city of Ephesus to preserve sound doctrine, to fight for the life
[time=1335] of the church at Ephesus. It was not going very well. There were very powerful men who were opposing
[time=1341] him. Men who, under the auspices of a testimony that made it past some people apparently, worked their way up into leadership in these little house churches that were scattered all around the city of Ephesus and Timothy was there to confront them, to confront their doctrine and to point out
[time=1357] the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Timothy was somewhat timid and apparently, under the
[time=1364] opposition was not doing very well. Look at verse 14. It says, "Do not neglect the spiritual gift within
[time=1370] you. God had given him the capacity to preach and teach and apparently the opposition had been so strong that he was backing away from the very thing to which God had called him, somewhat timid
[time=1380] by nature. They may have even influenced him doctrinally. Look at verse 7. But having nothing to do with
[time=1387] worldly fables fit only for old women, we'll talk about that as the message develops. But for now, by way of introductory review, it may be that he was even giving up on his own doctrine and becoming
[time=1398] absorbed and contemplating and involved in the false doctrine that these false religious leaders
[time=1404] were propagating." It appears they were also attacking him personally. It had shifted from an attack on
[time=1411] his doctrine to an attack on his person and not a hominem, if you will. Look at verse 12, "Let no one
[time=1417] look down on your youthfulness." They may have been accusing him of being too young for the job, too inexperienced, unable to really handle the responsibilities, as if Paul had made a mistake in assigning him to this ministry at Ephesus. So they were attacking him personally. They were influencing his doctrine and they were having an impact on his understanding even of his own ministry.
[time=1437] Look again at verse 7, "At the end of that verse on the other hand, discipline yourself for the
[time=1443] purpose of Godliness." There is the possibility that under the weight of the opposition, he was losing his own pursuit of his personal Godliness. He was letting the loosens go in his spiritual life,
[time=1454] and he was slipping in his maturity and his commitment and his zeal and his love for the person of Jesus Christ. And the consequences are devastating. Look at the end of the passage, verse 16,
[time=1465] "The end of that verse for as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you." Remember this is a church wrapped up in a pagan idolatous culture dominated by the
[time=1477] temple Diana. This would not be a civil place such as even Fort Wayne is. This would have been a San Francisco mentality or a New York City mentality where the world had it by the throat and had
[time=1488] full sway in a really demon-dominated culture. This was a seriously sick society wanting to
[time=1497] give an over to sin. And the backdrop of all this is the apostasy that we studied in the previous
[time=1505] section, verses 1 through 5, people were falling away from the faith, and Paul is very much aware that
[time=1511] unless Timothy holds himself to these priorities, to this job description, to this commitment as a
[time=1517] pastor, the eventuality of their falling away from the faith, even as a church, would be very likely.
[time=1523] And by the way, Satan would love nothing more for this church. Satan would love nothing more for this church than for us to become so involved in extraenius activities and to lose our priorities
[time=1535] and to lose our commitment to the Word of God, which we've had since the inception of this church, and let us drift off into a weak, pathetic commitment to the Word of God and to eventually apostasize. He loved for the place to be full, he loved for the budget to be fine, he loved for the
[time=1551] people to come and go, one of the auspices of religion just so long as we had sold out on the truth.
[time=1557] Nothing could make his heart happier. And so what these words are to Timothy, they are to me,
[time=1563] and really to every other pastor who would serve the Lord in the ministry. It gives us a basis of
[time=1570] evaluating our ministry. Oftentimes in this day of the media and the pulpit and the evangelist
[time=1578] through the television system, men are evaluated by whether or not they have a large church, whether or not
[time=1584] they've authored a number of books, whether or not they have a great following, whether or not they're sought after as some type of a conference speaker. And God may give that to certain individuals where he has gifted them for that purpose, but that's not the evaluation of a pastor. That's not what makes a pastor what a pastor is, and those are certainly not the goals of a pastor. The things to which a pastor
[time=1606] should be committed are right here in this text, and that is in part why knowing my own youth and my own desire to start in this ministry with you, I even selected this book because it is all about
[time=1617] the church, it is all about leadership in the church, and it is all about the pastor in the church, and so you have opportunity to listen in as I speak even to myself this morning, and it gives us both
[time=1629] common ground in evaluating the ministry. We'll look this morning at only a few of the
[time=1635] probably ten or eleven goals of a faithful servant of Christ, the first is found at the beginning of verse six. In pointing out these things to the brethren, you will be a good servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=1647] He says at the very beginning, point out these things. A good pastor sounds the alarm. He reaches over
[time=1653] and pulls the lever on the wall and lets the fire alarm ring when he sees smoke, when he sees fire,
[time=1659] when he sees encroaching danger. Pointing out these things, of course, is a reference to what Paul had
[time=1666] just done in the first five verses of this chapter. He said, "There are demon doctrines about. They are sourced in the demons themselves. They are communicated to human beings through human agents who are in verse two, hypocrites and liars, and they're seared in their own conscience." He exposes their false doctrine as abstaining from marriage and foods, which is really a mask or a
[time=1688] cloaked work ethic, a work salvation, which is the absolute opposite of the gospel of Jesus Christ, saved by faith, through grace or by grace through faith, the whole ministry of divine accomplishment
[time=1700] in our true and only salvation. And then he contrasts that in verses four and five by saying, "Everything is good. You need not abstain from marriage. You need not abstain from food. It's been given to you to enjoy." And so Paul lays even a framework or a foundation for Timothy to be
[time=1715] pointing out these things. And I want you to notice that it is very specific, it is very dogmatic,
[time=1721] it is very confrontational, it is face-to-face confrontation with error. That is what a good pastor
[time=1727] does. A good pastor, like the watchman of Ezekiel chapter three, who is set upon the city wall,
[time=1734] and you remember the imagery there, in the days of old they would find security behind the walls of
[time=1740] their cities, but they would then put the watchman up on top of the city walls on all four corners so
[time=1746] that he could then look for the encroaching or approaching army. And what kind of a watchman is it who would see the army coming to do the city in all that he loves harm and not sound the alarm,
[time=1757] not let them know that what is coming is dangerous and it's lethal and it's deadly. That's what he's
[time=1763] calling Timothy to do and to be a watchman. The ministry in itself should not be characteristically
[time=1770] negative. In other words, there are some men who are so negative and so much in defining fault with
[time=1776] everybody else that that really characterizes their entire ministry. The broad picture of ministry, as we will see, as we develop the passage is really generally very, very positive. But one aspect of it is the faithfulness to warn, the faithfulness to call a spade a spade, the faithfulness to confront
[time=1792] false doctrine, even though it may be culturally acceptable. And that is the mark of a good pastor.
[time=1797] So many times we think of a pastor as someone who is kind, someone who is mild-mannered, someone who is gracious, someone who would never hurt anyone, someone who always has a very nice thing to say to everyone so thoughtful, so considerate. And that may be the demeanor of a pastor, but that is not really what makes a pastor a pastor. That's more like saying that the pastor's function is to pet the sheep, and though there is some care in that regard, his primary function as we note from the beginning of this passage is not just to pet the sheep, but how capable is he
[time=1828] at protecting the sheep from wolves. The pastor's responsibility is to protect his flock from the wolves,
[time=1834] the savage wolves, that even Paul warned of or was warned of in Acts chapter 20 by the spirit of God, saying, "After I leave, savage wolves will come into the flock." I haven't seen it yet, but I was
[time=1847] called last night by a friend to share with me that the latest Christianity today, magazine, has an
[time=1854] entire little piece on John MacArthur, and they caricature him in a very negative light, responding to
[time=1861] his last three publications, his book on the gospel according to Jesus, which stands for the true gospel instead of an easy believism and a decisional regeneration type of gospel where you say,
[time=1872] "Gee, I believe in Jesus I'm saved, and now I can continue to live the rest of my life as an absolute sinner, as if nothing really happened to me." And his book confronts that. It also, his second book out, he's written recently, is the sufficiency of Christ, which establishes the sufficiency of the word of God and the sufficiency of your relationship with Jesus Christ to be what you need to grow and mature as a strong believer, and he takes a stand against some of the pragmatism that marks the church in America today, and then the other book that's recently come out would be a real concern and critique of the charismatic movement, and he is absolutely lamblasted, apparently, in this article because of his
[time=1907] commitment and this direction. And that's an interesting thought, especially in light of verse six, in pointing out these things to the brother, and you will be a good servant. It's the responsibility of a pastor to warn the flock of error. And we have in our country today such an accommodating pulpit,
[time=1925] such a conciliatory pulpit, such an almost evangelical ecumenicalism, which is a contradiction in terms
[time=1932] in and of itself, but in a sense we don't want to offend anybody, we want everybody to feel welcome, we want everybody to be able to come and enjoy themselves and just have absolutely no problem with what happens in church on Sunday morning. And frankly, if you're going to teach the word of God, that's impossible because the word of God is very confrontational, especially to a sinful and
[time=1951] then godly culture and a church which has the tendency to grab the flavor and the ambiance and the
[time=1957] milieu of what is popular in the culture and drag it into the church so that the church can be acceptable and popular and relevant, as some would say. So there's watered down little
[time=1969] sermonets for Christian ets, limp theology and convictionless preaching has really replaced
[time=1976] strong doctrine, clear exposition of the word of God and a deep understanding of the word of God.
[time=1981] People come sometimes to church looking for a spiritual goose bump and I evaluate my experience
[time=1987] in church this morning if I got some sense, some emotional thrill out of the message. And of course
[time=1994] there are times when that happens. Of course there are times when the spirit of God drives something deeply into your heart or an illustration touches your life in a peculiar way and you leave with
[time=2004] the real sense of the presence of God but my friends that is not the basis upon which to evaluate a church service. Have we worshiped God? Have we sung praises full of profound theology and doctrine
[time=2016] which give glory to the true and living God? Have we given effectively out of the resources in the offering? The offering is as much a part of the worship service as the song or the message. It's all just a part of our giving ourselves to God. And from the message you should examine has he been
[time=2032] fair to the text? Has he taught? Has he been faithful? Has he communicated the truth of God's word so that I can take that truth and apply it to my life, be girded by it, be strengthened by it, and be reminded in my mind and the renewing of my mind, Romans 121, that I am not to fall into the
[time=2049] deceptive demon doctrines of the world whether they are purely secular or come under religious guard.
[time=2054] That's what a pastor does. And that's what a flock should do. That's what a flock should be
[time=2060] looking for. That's what a flock should be evaluating. So number one, he sounds the alarm. He pulls the
[time=2068] lever. Number two, number two, he saturates himself in the word of God. An effective minister, an
[time=2077] excellent minister, a minister who will be useful to Jesus Christ saturates himself. Why do you say
[time=2083] that? Well, look at the end of verse six. He is constantly, constantly nourished on the words of
[time=2090] the faith and of the sound doctrine which you have been following. And that's an interesting note.
[time=2097] It's not new doctrine. It's not spectacular doctrine. It's not, you know, thrilling doctrine that
[time=2103] I've never heard before. It is this faithful commitment to repeat the fundamentals of the faith over and over and over again because we are constantly in need of reminding, to be refreshed, to be
[time=2114] encouraged by the sound doctrine which you've already been following. It's interesting to note
[time=2121] that the FBI, when they are training people to detect, they're training their own staff to detect
[time=2127] counterfeit money. They do not take that staff and show them all the counterfeit money that's ever
[time=2133] been passed off in the history of the United States of America. In fact, they rarely show them any counterfeit money at all. You know what they do? They spend all their time training their staff to
[time=2144] understand and recognize the real McCoy. They study the real thing. They know what a real dollar looks like. They know what a real $5 bill looks like. They know what a real $20 looks like. They know what a real $100 looks like. And then when you bring a fake $100 bill next to it, it's just obvious.
[time=2158] That's not that. This is wrong. This is a deviant. And it's not that I have to go out and study all
[time=2164] these deviant things. I just know what's real. And when you show me what's fake, well, it's fake. I can see
[time=2170] that. Excuse me. And that's the commitment that Paul is calling Timothy to do. In other words, your
[time=2177] job as a watchman is to stand on the walls of the city of the church and proclaim and herald when
[time=2183] danger is approaching. And you say, well, how do I know when it's dangerous? I mean, how do I know when it's really lethal? How do I know when it's wrong and when it's off and when it's subtly wrong, when it's even made to look by the angel of light to look like truth, it's got a feeling like truth. How do I know what it is? You know what it is by being constantly nourished on the words of
[time=2202] faith and on the sound doctrine. Giving yourself completely and totally that to the place that you are an expert in Scripture. And that's really the level. That's really the standard to be an expert student of the word of God. Know your book. Know your book. This is your life, pastor. This is what you
[time=2219] are. If you don't know this, you don't know anything. You don't know what you're supposed to know.
[time=2224] One of the most delightful times in my childhood was when my dad would allow me to skip school
[time=2230] and travel with him. He was a distributor for Zimmer, the orthopedic company that's just located over here in Warsaw. And he had a territory in Central California and there would be days when he would say, you know, you really don't want to go to school today and I'd say, you know what, that? I really don't want to go to school today. And so we would take off together and I put my suit and my tie on and I'd be right there with Bob Moore, Bob Moore and Russ Moore. We'd go call on the doctors and make our sales. He carried around a huge catalog, 10,000 products in the Zimmer
[time=2256] catalog. Everything from total hips to total knees to traction and hemovacs and neck braces. I mean,
[time=2262] just anything you can think of that you'd use in the orthopedic office. And 10,000 of these items.
[time=2267] And I was amazed. The doctor would bring up a particular item and say, do you have this? He'd say, oh yeah, that's right over here on page, you know, 792, that's number 2702. And we've got those in four
[time=2279] different sizes. I mean, the guy just knew his catalog. He knew everything about his catalog. He had mastered his book. And then we'd get out of the office and we'd sit in the car and I'd say, Dad,
[time=2289] did you make a sale? And he says, oh yeah, I say, what's your sale? And he'd tell me everything he sold and I'd say, well, Dad, how much did you make? You know, what was your commission? And he'd sit there in his mind and he knew every product number and he knew the commission on every single product number and they were different. And by the time we were out of the doctor's parking lot, he could tell me what he made. Absolute expert in what he was doing. That's the commitment. Spent some time on
[time=2314] Friday with a good friend of mine who's a neurosurgeon. He's in his last year of training and he has sat already for his written exam. There are only a hundred of these people graduated out of all the
[time=2325] universities and medical schools in America. There's only a hundred brain surgeon types that are getting graduated every year. And he told me that it's the society's commitment to flunk 20% of them.
[time=2334] So you go into that room realizing that out of the 120 of us are not going to come out of this
[time=2340] room being able to continue to practice. There were 500 questions on his exam. He missed 100 out of
[time=2346] 500 and he ranked 13th in the nation. That is the level at which they are pushing these men to
[time=2353] know the body, to know the brains and all the related functions. They absolutely demand absolute
[time=2359] excellence from these men. It's the exact same thing in the ministry. I wish I wish we could have
[time=2365] conducted Scott Call's pre-ordination councils right up here in front of all of you on Sunday mornings.
[time=2370] We sat down with Scott over three different periods. We had three men, the chairman of our board, Bill Archer. We had a member of our church around Scarf. He's a Bible faculty member at Summit and we had Peter Coby. And Peter Coby was practical theology and Ron Scarf was doctrine and Bill
[time=2386] Archer was Bible knowledge. How well do you know the Bible? And you would have absolutely been thrilled.
[time=2391] Bill Archer gets his chance for 30 minutes, three different meetings. And for about 15 or 20 minutes in each meeting, he just looks at Scott and says, "I'm going to give you a chapter. You tell me what's in it." And so Genesis 12, Scott answers. Genesis 37, Scott answers. Genesis 50, Exodus 12, Exodus 20,
[time=2406] John 16, Romans 4, Revelation 5. And Scott just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, like bore me with
[time=2412] this stuff. Where are we going? He knows the book. And that's exactly what we were testing him to find
[time=2418] out if he could do. Ron Scarf says, "Tell me the difference between the indwelling, the baptism, the filling, and the sealing of the Holy Spirit." And so boom, Scott comes up with a proper definition for every one of them, how they differ when they occur, what the ministry is, and what it does for the cause of Christ. All kinds of various questions about practical theology, about doctrine, and about
[time=2438] Bible knowledge. Expert, student of the Word of God. And he knows, like I know, we're just beginning.
[time=2443] It's called a lifetime pursuit trying to understand and comprehend and devote and dedicate yourself
[time=2449] to the Word of God. But that is the standard. And that is the standard of evaluation.
[time=2455] Are you nourished on the words of faith? And are you nourished on sound doctrines so that you can
[time=2461] spot the air, call a spade a spade, alert the people, and save them from disaster? Number three,
[time=2468] what's the third check mark? On an effective minister you'll find that at the beginning of verse 7,
[time=2474] but have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. Have nothing to do with old
[time=2483] with fables fit only for old women. The effective pastor separates himself from false doctrine.
[time=2490] He separates himself from the study of false doctrine. And you say, well, that sounds obvious,
[time=2496] until you realize what most of the seminaries in America are doing today. This phrase, "fables fit only for old women" is a very sarcastic phrase that Paul is employing,
[time=2507] and it comes out of the philosophical culture of his day. And when a man would espouse a view that they
[time=2513] just wanted a lambast. I mean, they just wanted to call it the worst thing they could call it. They'd say, you know what that is? That's a fable fit only for old women. And what they're saying is it's like a cynical senile old lady would tell some tale to a little child who would naively accept it.
[time=2528] And what Paul is saying is that an effective pastor does not open his mind. He does not spend the
[time=2534] preponderance of his time studying all of this plethora of false doctrine that has filled literally
[time=2541] the seminaries of America. We don't call it fables fit for old women in America today. We call it
[time=2547] higher criticism, or scholarship, or the intellectual elite. And what they do when you go to one of
[time=2554] these seminaries is they spend very little time studying the word of God itself. And they are
[time=2560] involved in all kinds of studies that are designed to under-road the word of God. Under-minded as
[time=2568] what it is. And they questioned the authorship that Paul really write first Timothy and they go into this whole long dissertation about how it couldn't have been Paul by virtue of the language and the choice of words and this and that. He didn't finish out the book like he should have, like he did over in that other book. And they questioned the date of writing. It couldn't have been Paul because it wasn't written in the right time period. And they go into this long scholastic endeavor to talk about the dating of the book. And they say it couldn't have been Paul because the reliability of the manuscripts that we have on that aren't sufficient to give us that kind of conclusion. So they go into a long detailed really brilliant study but in absolute futility to try to determine whether or not this
[time=2606] was a fair manuscript from which to call the word of God. When you're done you've got a bunch of convictionless men. You've got a bunch of men who have more doubt in their head than they have affirmation. You've got a bunch of men who aren't sure what they believe and if they can believe anything.
[time=2621] And so they come out and they fill their pulpit with this convictionless preaching, this accommodating
[time=2627] preaching, this secularized preaching. Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7, the Sermon on the Mount,
[time=2634] he said, "Beware of false prophets and the word beware could have literally been translated, hold your mind back. Hold your mind back. You have absolutely no business delving in to all of this
[time=2647] false doctrine and all of this questioning material that brings doubt and uncertainty about
[time=2654] the word of God." You say, "Well, isn't that indoctrination?" I mean, aren't we being intellectually unfair if we don't consider all the options? I mean, shouldn't we really study all of the criticism about the Bible? And I would say there is probably a place for apologetics, the careful study,
[time=2669] and the proof and support of the truth of the word of God, but that's a far cry from going to seminary to try to learn how to be a pastor and all they do is fill your mind with all the doubts that the the liberal theologians have been able to dream up through the centuries. When I was at the Master's
[time=2685] College, it was during that time that we were also starting the Master's seminary and I was allowed to be in in those formative meetings and we sat down over several different meetings over a couple different days and wrote down the distinctives of the Master's seminary. This was going to be a place to train men for ministry. This is going to be a place to do this, to do this. One of the distinctives is relevant to our topic today. It says this, "At the Master's seminary, instruction
[time=2708] is based on biblical certainties from the word of God rather than on doubts, critical themes,
[time=2715] or reactions." In other words, we're not going to spend our time studying the work of a bunch of
[time=2721] liberal dead theologians who raised a whole bunch of questions about the veracity of the word of God. We instead will choose to indoctrinate the men in what we already know to be the truth of the word of God so that they can stand up in front of people with conviction and speak the truth.
[time=2736] So marks of an effective minister are one, he sounds the alarm, two, he saturates himself
[time=2746] in the word of God and three, he separates himself from false doctrine. Fourth and lastly, he
[time=2753] strives for personal holiness. He strives for this. Look at the end of verse seven. Instead of
[time=2763] these worldly fables, on the other hand, discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.
[time=2770] Now it's contrasted here for bodily discipline is only a little profit,
[time=2776] but godliness is profitable for all things since it holds a promise for the present life
[time=2784] and also for the life to come. This is a word, this notion of disciplining yourself,
[time=2792] bodily discipline. It's talking about Greek root word which was translated gymnasium and it's
[time=2798] that whole early culture, this Greek culture, where the emphasis was on the physique because much of
[time=2804] their day-to-day was tied up in very physical activities, lifting, moving, walking, and your body
[time=2810] was critical. And so young men would go to the gymnasium very early in life and it would really in some ways replace their education because they were going to become strong, healthy, vibrant physical men so that they could adapt and be successful in their culture. And by the way, even as today, these gymnasiums became the hotbed of homosexual activity and was a very negative thing, but
[time=2831] the point he's making here is that if you're going to strive after something, strive after spiritual
[time=2838] things, strive after godliness and he makes the comparison. He says if you're going to strip yourself
[time=2846] down and be ready to compete as if in an Olympic or the Ispian Games, which would have been the
[time=2852] Games of that day, if you're going to work and toil and sweat and have commitment to put something in shape, put your soul in shape first, and then worry about your body. Now of course there is a
[time=2864] place to be concerned about your body especially if you're the leader of a church. And I think it's most unbecoming of the church and of Christ for a pastor to let himself go to the extent that he is physically unkempt and unfit. And so as he says there is a prophet there but it is little prophet.
[time=2880] Why? Because it only affects your body and it is only for the limited time of your life span.
[time=2886] Whereas if you work on your soul, if you cultivate your love for Christ, it affects not just your body but your body and your soul and it is eternal. It lasts forever. But just for a minute and to compare
[time=2899] ourselves when I think about working out physically and by the way I've just finished like a three and a half month endeavor on trying to be a little more physically fit. I was noticing I'd fallen into some really bad habits. I was eating too much, I was gaining weight and I was watching too much TV in the later
[time=2915] hours of the evening like from 10 to 12 and I'd say to myself boy at the end of the day I think I'll just catch the news here for a minute and think I'd watch for 10 or 15 minutes but it kind of gets you know mesmerizing for me and so I end up sitting there till about 12 o'clock at night. I get up, I shut the thing off and I look at my clock and it's too late, I have a 630 appointment, I'm going to be dead, I'm not going to be effective and I just was in this bad habit. So I said to my buddy Steve Longbreak, I said Steve could you help me? I need some help. Would you mind starting an entirely new different
[time=2944] workout schedule? There were two of us and you can hold me accountable in this and he said sure.
[time=2949] So to take care of going to bed to late we thought well let's get up at 5.20 every morning and that pretty much does away with late nights if you know what I mean and we would meet here at the church at 5.45 we'd drive down to the gym, we'd be there at 6. We'd run a couple of miles, we'd lift some weights, we'd take a shower, we'd come back, we're back at church by 7.30, you're alive, you're alert, you're awake and you know you're not getting overweight still and you're also not staying up to late and losing that energy for the day. So there is a correlation in there and sometimes your
[time=2978] body and your physical fitness is a response of what God is doing in your heart. So don't give you wrong, I'm not saying it's wrong to be physically fit. But when you think about getting physically fit it must be consistent, it has to happen on a regular basis, it is a decision of the will,
[time=2994] you don't just, you don't just happen to get into good shape, you have to make a conscious deliberate decision, I am going to get in good physical condition, you have to strive inside of
[time=3004] that, you've got to push yourself, no pain, no gain, if you're not pushing yourself, there's no progress and it has to be a long-term commitment, it doesn't happen overnight. Now just think about that, that is a perfect analogy of spiritual growth and I'll ask you those questions, are you consistently,
[time=3019] regularly, faithfully pursuing Godliness in your life? Is that what you're doing? I mean could
[time=3026] somebody look at you and say you know what, that person is consistently and regularly pursuing
[time=3032] Godliness. Is it an exercise of your will? In other words do you only get spiritual and get your
[time=3039] Bible out and have a quiet time or pray or get involved in some ministry or do something for somebody else to strengthen your spiritual muscles? Do you only do that when you have the whim, when you feel like it? I mean I'll tell you there were most mornings that I was not about to get out of bed at 520 except I made a decision to do it and I knew that Steve would be there and I would be embarrassed
[time=3059] if he weren't there so there's the whole level of accountability and sometimes you have to add that to your will. You're not strong enough on your own just to say okay man, I've got to do it, I've got to be in the word on a regular basis, I've got to stop this particular habit, I've got to start doing this and with all the best of intentions within a week it's just gone and now a yard's feeling guilty. So with the decision of the will you couple strong accountability with someone you respect and you say I've got to change, this is got to change. There is striving, are you pushing
[time=3088] yourself? In the same way that you would physically, are you pushing yourself to be more godly this year than you were last and maybe that's more godly in saying I'm too materialistic, I'm going to buy
[time=3099] less and give more, maybe it's too selfish with your time, I'm going to do less for myself and I'm going to get an ministry, maybe it's the way you're impacting your neighborhood or somebody on your block, are you pushing yourself to a new level of servitude and then are you willing to make it a
[time=3115] long-term commitment and stay with it. So those are the kinds of things that Paul is trying to say.
[time=3120] If you are going to be committed to a kind of discipline, my friend, the most important part is your spiritual discipline. It is the profitable one, the most profitable for it is eternal.
[time=3131] So as we just kind of come to a conclusion this morning, I want to remind you we are looking at the
[time=3143] elements of the noble, the excellent servant of Christ. He is one who sounds the alarm,
[time=3149] he is one who saturates himself in the word of God, he is one who separates himself from false
[time=3156] doctrine and he is one who is striving for personal godliness. Another note of personal application,
[time=3165] you're not called into the ministry like I am, it's not your job, it's not something God has set you
[time=3172] apart to do but God has indeed called you to your workplace, he has called you to your neighborhood,
[time=3178] he has called you to your friends and he has called you to be a servant. True?
[time=3183] Then I want to know something, in your servanthood for Christ, do you sound the alarm?
[time=3189] When you see a friend who is beginning to move down a dangerous path,
[time=3197] are you of the accepting, conciliating, approving nature of our day where only weirdos like
[time=3207] Rush Limbaugh are confrontational? Or are you willing to say you know something I had a real concern?
[time=3216] I'm willing to sound the alarm and by the way a lot of the alarms that Rush is sounding are probably
[time=3223] needed but he's one of the few people that I think is around that's willing to just this is what I think but more important than the political arena, are you doing that spiritually
[time=3234] in the life of your friends? Secondly, do you saturate yourself in the word of God?
[time=3240] Servanthood requires that, servanthood requires the type of faithful indoctrination in the values
[time=3250] of the word of God or we are so quickly torn from this truth and encroached in our understanding
[time=3256] of the purpose of our life by demonic values. Do you separate yourself from worldly doctrines
[time=3265] or do you have an open mind and are you striving for personal godliness? I hope so.
[time=3276] I hope so. Came across something this week I thought you might find interesting.
[time=3281] There's about calling a pastor to a church. One of the toughest tasks a church faces is
[time=3288] choosing a good minister this little thing went. One of the members of a search committee reached the place of absolute frustration with the rest of the committee because they continued to reject perfectly capable applicants. So he presented to them a letter purporting to be from another
[time=3303] applicant which he really had himself written and said this way, "Gentlemen, understanding that
[time=3309] your pulpit is vacant. I should like to apply for the position. I have many qualifications. I have
[time=3316] been a preacher with much success and I have also had some successes a writer. Some say that I'm a
[time=3323] good organizer. I've been a leader in most of the places I've been and I'm about 50 years old.
[time=3329] However, I have never preached in one place for more than three years. In some places I have left town
[time=3335] after my work has caused riots and disturbances. I must admit I have been in jail three or four times.
[time=3343] My health is not good though I still do get a bunch of stuff done. The churches I have preached in
[time=3350] have been small though often located in several large different cities. I've not gotten along well with the religious leaders in towns where I have preached. In fact, some have attacked me and threatened me physically. There have been fights. I'm not too good at keeping records. I've been known to forget whom I baptized. However, if you can use me, I shall do my best for you. And the committee
[time=3373] members reacted by saying, "Are you nuts? Are you crazy? We're going to hire an unhealthy, trouble-making absent-minded ex-Jailbird?" That's when the man who wrote the letter said, "Well, it's
[time=3385] signed in the Apostle Paul. We've been sharing with you music from our sanctuary
[time=3415] choir and the soloist Brian Lowson. I also had a special guest, one of our missionaries Jim Elliott sing for us this morning. The message was from our pastor, Russell Moore. If as a result of
[time=3426] today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's bow and pray this prayer together. Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I am
[time=3437] a sinner and that I need Jesus as my Savior. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed
[time=3443] and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen." If you prayed that prayer today, would you
[time=3450] write us and tell us the nature of your decision? When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3460] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the package of 72 Bible character cards,
