[time=0] When was the last time you saw one of your friends, one of your good Christian
[time=6] friends, either directly involved in sin or definitely on a path that would soon lead them into sin? And more importantly, what was your response? How did you
[time=17] react? What did you say? What did you do? Anything?
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we
[time=38] hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Our society
[time=45] stresses individual freedoms. What an individual does is nobody's business but his own. God, on the other hand, has given us some different guidelines. He instructs us to be ready to confront a fellow Christian when he is involved in sin, and he expects us to be ready to receive that counsel when appropriate. Today, Pastor Russ will be looking at this delicate balance of Christian confrontation in a message which he has entitled "Respecting and Rebuking the Saints." We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy. We will be looking in at chapter 5 verses 1 and 2. But before Pastor
[time=83] Russ's message, "Charla Schultz" will be singing the song "No One Understands Like Jesus."
[time=89] As we begin our service today, let's join our sanctuary choir in orchestra as they present "The Lord Is My Light."
[time=113] "The Lord Is My Light" will be singing the song "No One Understands Like Jesus" will be singing the song
[time=137] "No One Understands Like Jesus" will be singing the song "No One Understands Like Jesus" will be singing the song
[time=282] "No One Understands Like Jesus" will be singing the song "No One Understands Like Jesus" will be singing the song "No One Understands Like Jesus" will be singing the song "No One Understands Like Jesus" will be singing the song
[time=312] I know that you've been involved in weddings and I was involved in one yesterday. We've got them next week and the following week. But those are great times. And Russ, you've been involved in a series of messages. They've been going well. You're going to change gears just a little bit this morning. Tell us what you're going to speak on.
[time=327] Well, that's right. I've enjoyed the personal study and self-examination involved in looking at the passage there in 1st Timothy 4 as the far as the effective pastor. But today it switches as we continue on in the book of 1st Timothy to a call to real personal understanding.
[time=342] We've got a lot of people involved amongst the saints to have discussions and offer feedback and receive feedback as to how we're actually doing in our walk with the Lord and the value really of a third perspective or an outside perspective, giving on us feedback and commentary on how they think we're doing it.
[time=359] So the Lord and a lot of times that is viewed as such a threatening experience. And I'm sure we all have some war stories of how we've been abused by people who make comment about our life and it really hurts and it cuts and they're distant and they really had no place saying that.
[time=373] But I think what Paul's calling for in the church at Ephesus and therefore here is in the context of relationships, real significant meaningful relationships.
[time=382] We have a good honest feedback, one to another about how we're doing with our wives or our kids or walk with the Lord or our money or our service in the church. So let me be exciting.
[time=393] Certainly our wives can be a great help in that area of loving, gentle opinions of how we're doing and we certainly are blessed with a great elderboard that is gracious to us and encourages us and helps us along the way.
[time=408] We've told you several times about the summer celebration that we have on Wednesday evenings. I want you to look ahead to June 17th and June 24th.
[time=418] Professor Ron Scarf, professor from Summit Christian College and a member of our church will be speaking. His title is "A Rejoice in Hope" and then on the 24th it's praise that precedes victory.
[time=431] Sounds like some very positive topics. We've heard Ron Scarf speak many times and he certainly is an encouraging individual.
[time=440] And I want you to come on June 24th and June 17th. Those are both Wednesday evenings, 7pm right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=449] Then we're getting very close to the patriotic panorama. We're calling it this year, "Celebrate America".
[time=455] The date for that is June 28th at 4pm right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=461] Russell, we have a number of churches in our town and one of them that we've had contact with is the Calvary Chapel downtown.
[time=469] Brenda Whitfield has been here a number of times, the Music Directors Joe Cook. They're going to join us in a section that's a gospel section of music and with our choir and their choir, I think we're going to have some real music in the middle of the patriotic panorama.
[time=483] It's awfully exciting. So that will be one of the highlights. Brenda Whitfield is sung in Fort Wayne for a number of years. An outstanding soloist and the choir from Calvary Chapel will be joining Black Hawk for the celebration on June 28th, patriotic panorama, "Celebrate America".
[time=501] So I hope you set that aside. And then we've talked a number of times about these character cards. We're going to do that through the month of June because we've had such a great response.
[time=511] Here's a picture of Abel, Abraham, Adam, Amos, 72 different characters that are in the Bible, a picture of them, a little description of their life when they lived and their relationship to the Lord Jesus Christ, and a verse on the back, a great way to learn about the characters in the Bible.
[time=531] Again, if you have children coming this summer, why don't you write and ask for these 72 character cards. You can receive them by writing to the Bible Hour today at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=556] Right for your packet today, we'd love to hear from you. We're going back to the regular portion of our service now for some more music from Charlotte Schultz and the message from our pastor teacher.
[time=566] If you have your Bible handy, why don't you just get ready, turn to 1 Timothy, and be ready to study God's Word together.
[time=577] No one is so near, so dear, let Jesus rest your every care on me.
[time=592] No one understands like Jesus, He's a friend beyond compare.
[time=606] Meet Him at the throne of her singing. He is waiting for you there.
[time=620] No one understands like Jesus, when the days are dark and grim.
[time=635] No one is so near, so dear, as Jesus casts your every care on me.
[time=650] No one understands like Jesus, when we falter on the way.
[time=664] Though we fail Him, also sadly fail Him. He will pardon us today.
[time=680] No one understands like Jesus, when the days are so dark and grim.
[time=694] No one is so near, so dear, as Jesus casts your every care on me.
[time=709] Cast your every care on me.
[time=739] Amen, thank you, Charlotte.
[time=758] I want to set the scene for our message this morning by talking a little bit about blind spots and asking you a few questions along those lines.
[time=767] Have you ever had that experience when you are driving in your car, and you need to change lanes, you know, move from the left lane to the right hand lane, and you look in the rear view mirror, you look in the side view mirror, you give a quick glance over your right shoulder, you figure it's all clear, you start to move, and suddenly you find out that there was a car sitting right in your blind spot, and it begins to honk at you, furiously sometimes, as you continue to move over and you look then in your side view mirror again, and you see this car, kind of on the embankment, waiting for you to wake up and get out of its lane.
[time=796] Have you ever been the third car in a setting like that, where you were involved, you were back a little bit, and you saw the guy, and he didn't know, and so he moves over, and it's just obvious to you, you saw the whole thing coming, because you had a little different perspective on the issue.
[time=816] Last Sunday, some of the ladies were coming in early for choir in a room where I kind of prayed before the service was back there, and I ducked my head out there to get a drink, and I noticed that one of the ladies had a tag on the back of a dress right up here by the collar that was just obviously hanging out, and so I went up to her, and I said, you know, I think you missed this, let me get this for you, so I tucked that in there, and she said, well thank you, I live at home, and so sometimes that happens to me, without another perspective.
[time=845] If you ever noticed that some of the greatest athletes in the world, some of the most talented gifted people physically, higher coaches, and trainers, to watch their golf swing, because what they think they're doing may not actually be what they're doing, and they need a third party to observe and give feedback and comment, whether that be a golf swing, or a golf shot, or the way a football is released, or all kinds of different places where people are asked for a third opinion in management sometimes.
[time=874] Companies will call in a consultant, because they need a third party's opinion, they need a different perspective, they know what they think they're doing, they know what they're trying to accomplish, but they also know they may not be in the best position to evaluate themselves, and so they hire a consultant of some sort.
[time=893] Never had somebody pull up next to you when you're driving down the highway and honk at you and get your attention and point at your tire, because it's obviously low, and you didn't know that, and they're trying to get you to an off ramp where you can get that fixed before the thing goes completely flat and you're stranded with no help.
[time=910] Perspective, other people's perspective about your life, how you're doing, it leads me to ask another question. When was the last time you saw, or noticed, or became aware of the fact that one of your Christian friends was either directly involved in sin, or was definitely on a path that would lead to sin?
[time=935] What was the last time I'd like you to put a name to that question? Is there somebody even in your life this morning, or this week, or this month, where you can look at their life and see in their life, observe in their life, either their involvement in sin, or the path, attitudinally, or a habit, or a characteristic, or a pattern that will inevitably lead them to very destructive sin?
[time=960] You got a name there? I bet you do. Now one more question before we turn in our text this morning, what is your response to people like that? What do you do?
[time=974] When you see somebody that you know that's a Christian friend that's either in sin or on a path to sin, what is your typical response to that situation?
[time=983] Maybe it's a little bit like mine. I was driving down the road about four or five years ago in a city called Ventura out in California, and I can see it as if it were yesterday. In front of me there was a truck, a pickup truck, driving down the road, and there was a big German shepherd in the back, and he was having a great time, you know, how they get their head around the side of the truck and catch that wind in their face and let their, you know, tongue hang out the side of their mouth, they're just having a great old time, but suddenly this German shepherd decides to jump out of the truck.
[time=1011] And so he jumps, and I notice he's tethered to the truck, and everything now goes slow-mo, you know, when you know you're going to see something like this, your adrenaline fires, and it all starts to happen in slow-mo, so he's out there in thin air, and the tether goes tunt, and he gets yanked in the direction of the truck, and now he's being bounced down the road by the side of this truck.
[time=1032] And I was paralyzed by the sight. I didn't honk my horn. I tried to scream, but nothing came out. I was so panicked by the, you know, shocking reality of what I was seeing.
[time=1045] I just felt sick to my stomach. Finally this guy noticed that his dog was banging along the road. He got out, beat his dog, put his dog back in the truck, and apparently his dog got a habit, you know, of jumping out.
[time=1056] So this was this guy's solution. I'll just tether my dog, and hang it as I drive down the animal rights people would have fun with that one.
[time=1068] You know, sometimes you see situations, and you just don't know what to do, and it happens just in the course of everyday life, and it happens often in the church when we care and love about each other, and we see each other heading off in a dangerous direction.
[time=1085] Paul is, again, writing to Timothy, and if you would, turn to 1 Timothy chapter 5, and we'll find some, I believe, critical, essential, helpful advice.
[time=1096] Actually, these are commands. The verb is a command here to be involved in each other's lives in a meaningful way as we see each other heading off in a bad direction.
[time=1109] Let's read the passage, verses 1 and 2, 1 Timothy 5. Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather appeal to him as a father to the younger men as brothers, then verse 2, the older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters in all purity.
[time=1128] The word rebuke, do not rebuke, is kind of a word picture word, it would mean to strike someone with your words, to verbally hit them, to give them blows, it is to hammer somebody with your words, to strip them of dignity, to leave them with no gracious way out.
[time=1146] To just list off a string of descriptive, degradating comments that would just absolutely smash and pummel their self-image and their self-confidence, and their feelings about your feelings about them.
[time=1159] All you have to do is see this, once or twice, and you know you never want to be involved in it.
[time=1164] I was in a market not too long ago, and I didn't see the whole thing develop, but it was a mother and her three-year-old son, and she had stepped away from the cart, he was in the cart, the shopping cart, and she was checking out the frozen goods here, and I don't know what he did, but whatever he did, he lit her fire.
[time=1179] And she came back over to him, and grabbed him by the arm, and got within two inches of his face, and literally cussed him out, I'm talking about football language here folks, I'm talking about the grossest, most vile couple of sentences fired right at him, right in his face.
[time=1197] And he had no response, but to say at the end, when she was finished, no, you are. And just out of like a quarter-threatened little animal takes a swat with his paw, trying to regain some sense of dignity, tries to throw it all back in her face.
[time=1212] You just see anything like that, and you go, I don't want to be within a hundred miles of that. That's what he is saying, we shouldn't do. Don't strip people of their dignity.
[time=1223] If you find somebody in trouble, if you find somebody who's struggling with sin, you find somebody who's making some unwise choices that you can see will inevitably lead to real harm and relationships in life, don't come to them and beat them up with your words.
[time=1237] Strip them of their dignity. Come instead, the word is appeal, but rather appeal to them. It's paracolato, the word to encourage.
[time=1247] And God has given several sources of this kind of encouragement, encouragement to obey. One is the Holy Spirit, the paracolato, or, excuse me, paracletas.
[time=1258] The Holy Spirit is called the paracletas, the comfort of the one who comes alongside, the one who speaks in the inner man and convicts your conscience and probes you to do certain things.
[time=1268] He comes to encourage you to appeal with you, to support you, to get you to live godly and obediently.
[time=1273] The other thing is, given you as the word of God itself, it's a paracletas, it's the word of God, it is the encourager.
[time=1281] And so the word of God at times is that thing which spurs you onto obedience and causes you to forsake your sin, but we are the paracolato people.
[time=1290] We are the ones who give encouragement. So it's the Holy Spirit, it's the word of God, and it's the saints. It's the people.
[time=1296] And this is all a part of God's design for the church. You can't have it with, you need all three of those things that work in each other's lives before you have a healthy and a strong and a vibrant church.
[time=1306] Why do I say that? Well you've been studying this book with us now for several months. The church is in trouble, just briefly at Ephesus.
[time=1314] And so Paul comes to do a couple of things through this letter. He says we got to get the doctrine straight, and you know chapter one, he hammers the false doctrine, he lifts up the true grace of Christ and salvation by faith.
[time=1325] Then he says in chapters two and three, we got to put the church in order. So he talks about how to pray, he talks about the women's role, he talks about the leadership elders and deacons.
[time=1335] And so he gets the order, the form, the function of the church. And then he talks to the preacher, and he says preacher you got to be biblical, you got to be authoritative, you got to cut it straight, you got to give the people biblical principles that will confront and convict them in their lives.
[time=1349] And you think well man what else do you need for a healthy church? I mean isn't that it? We've got a great doctrinal statement, we've got the right church polity, we've got the right church organization, and we're trying to have the word of God communicated on a weekly basis that really comes out of scripture and calls it like it is.
[time=1364] What else would you need? The obvious answer is the development of thought moves through this book as you need at least one more thing.
[time=1374] You need people inside the church who stand for that doctrinal statement, who support that church's organization, who support that preaching of the word of God, and who are willing to take that preaching of the word of God, and bring it to bear on each other's lives in the specific day in and day out, ebb and flow of light.
[time=1393] If you don't have that in your church, if you don't have those kinds of meaningful honest relationships in your church, you'll be weak, you'll be unhealthy, you'll be sick, you'll be plagued.
[time=1406] Would you go back a few books to Hebrews? Second Timothy Titus, Philemon Hebrews, just back a few books to Hebrews chapter three. Hebrews chapter three, and you'll kind of see the same thing being taught.
[time=1417] Again you remember the church that's represented here in this book, the book of Hebrews, a bunch of Jews who had come out of the Old Testament way of worship, had embraced Jesus Christ and fall under horrendous persecution and trial and suffering, and many of them were considering abandoning their faith.
[time=1433] And so it's a very trying time in the life of this particular church as well, Hebrews chapter three, verse 12. Take care, brethren.
[time=1442] Lest there should be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart in falling away from the living God.
[time=1450] Don't let that happen to you, how, verse 13. But encourage one another, day after day as long as it is still called today, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[time=1462] Paraka, oh, one another, get involved in each other's lives. You have a heart that is inclined to sin, that is deceitful, that is self-justifying.
[time=1471] We have an amazing capacity to rationalize our behavior, redefine it, and say that what is probably unhealthy and even sometimes sinful is okay.
[time=1482] Our heart is deceitful and wicked. We have blind spots spiritually. We need a consultant. We need somebody in the third car back to honk and to warn us as we begin to move over when somebody is in our blind spot.
[time=1499] We need a coach to stand there and watch the swing and say, you think you're doing this, but you're not. It's not what's actually happening.
[time=1509] We need people to give feedback and commentary on our relationships, our habits, our attitudes. You say, well, what do you mean?
[time=1519] Let me be really specific. You can be with a family for a period of time, not to mention the length of time that we enjoy here at this church where we build relationships for years, and you can see the kinds of things that are going on between the parent and the children.
[time=1537] Sometimes you'll notice a permissive parent with really no strength and no will and no backbone who finds clever ways to acquiesce to the demanding controlling children in their home. It's all backwards. You can see it. It's obvious to you.
[time=1553] You can see the home where there are smothering parents who dominate the children and control the children and manipulate the children and sometimes the teenager and such that they have no room for individual preference, no room to explore their responsibility, authority, dynamic in their life and spread their wings and learn to fly. They're just smothered by the parents. You can see that.
[time=1576] You can recognize that in your friends. You have seen the stern, harsh, impatient parent that can't be bothered with yet another interruption so he slashes and bites and crushes with his words, the spirit of his child.
[time=1590] You're aware of that. You don't need a master's degree in counseling to see that stuff. Just there. It's obvious.
[time=1597] Or the father who is so preoccupied in his mind, so full with things that are important to him, his life, his day, his work, his recreation, that the question of his young six-year-old son falls on deaf ears once, then twice, then three times until the kid just stops asking.
[time=1616] Those are the kinds of things I'm talking about. Those are the kinds of things the word of God is calling us to be involved in with each other.
[time=1625] You're thinking to yourself, are you trying to say that as friends, Christian friends, we're supposed to talk about how the other family is raising their kids?
[time=1635] Do you have any idea of how explosive that is? You're trying to promote friendships. You're going to destroy friendships this way.
[time=1642] Well, I'm sure all of us could tell some pretty gruesome stories about how an aunt or an uncle or a well-intending friend came crashing into a situation with the sensitivity of a bull and a china shop, made great commentary on what we were doing wrong and then left us in the rubble of our own despair and hurt and pain.
[time=1660] That happens. It happens a lot. You probably all have your own stories. That's not what this text is talking about and because that kind of thing happens from time to time does not mean then we should adopt some doctrine of privacy.
[time=1674] You know what I mean by that? The word clearly says that we are involved in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and you can give doctrine after doctrine after doctrine to support that.
[time=1685] Second Corinthians 4 and 5, the doctrine of reconciliation says that there was a good relationship between God and man. It was torn apart by sin and reconciliation brings that relationship back into perfect harmony and unity through Christ. That's a personal relationship with Christ.
[time=1700] The doctrine of the substitutionary atonement of Christ, his death for your death, his blood for your blood, your sin on his shoulders. He took your sin and died your death in a personal loving, intimate way because he cares for you.
[time=1712] It's a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It's a personal relationship with God. The Father Ephesians 1 says that he knew you in him before the foundation of the world.
[time=1722] Before even the world was created. God knew you. He knew your name. He knew he loved you. He knew he'd save you. It's personal. Don't ever confuse your personal relationship with Christ and with God with the notion of a private relationship with God and with Christ.
[time=1738] There is no doctrine in the New Testament to support that you and I have a private relationship with Christ.
[time=1746] Instead, the over again and again and again repeated call in the New Testament is that we should confess our sin one to another, we should bear one another burdens, we should care for one another, love for one another, appeal to one another, encourage one another so that there would not be a deceitful hardened heart that would fall away from the living God.
[time=1766] The call over and over and over again in the word of God is for you and I to be involved in meaningful Christian relationships where these kinds of things can be talked about because we have blind spots and we don't often see.
[time=1784] A buddy of mine visited several months ago, we had gone to school together, we had ministered together, we stayed in contact on a regular basis, came to visit for three days, I was thrilled, we played racquetball together, we did this together, we did that together, we talked about old times, we went out to eat with a family, the whole bit, we're in the car on the way back to the airport there.
[time=1804] I'm talking about the international airport now folks, not bare field, okay, let's get this straight and we're about halfway there and he said Russ, when did you stop listening?
[time=1819] I said sorry, he said when did you stop listening to your kids?
[time=1825] I said I don't know, what do you mean? What I wanted to do is you know push my ejector seat, he's gone, thank you.
[time=1837] What do you mean? He said well Russell I've been watching for three days now and he gave me like three different specific situations.
[time=1847] He said you know Nikki asked it this way and then a couple seconds later she asked it this way and then she asked it this way, you didn't hear any of them and eventually she just stopped and he says I looked at the little look on her face and it was just well I guess he doesn't care.
[time=1870] Pull that thing out wipe it off, hand it back. He's right and I don't want to be that kind of dad but I didn't necessarily see that I didn't feel the spirit of God overwhelmingly convicting me that I was not listening to my kids.
[time=1890] It took somebody who loves me and cares about me and knows me and is with me and is close enough to my life to say hey.
[time=1899] Is that the kind of dad you want to be? A couple weeks ago we spent some time with another family in our church here only known these people about a year but been watching, been having fun together going through the course of life and joining each other, letting a relationship build and develop.
[time=1916] I noticed on this particular day that we were together the one daughter whenever the father would correct that behavior or say something to that child to stop a particular behavior that daughter would just turn and come with a very defensive kind of volatile response like not me or I didn't do that or what's the matter or what.
[time=1941] You watch that thing all day and you know that's not new, that's not just a bad day, some of us just have bad days as family, you know you've got to cut each other some slack but we've been watching that thing for about eight or nine months.
[time=1953] The next week we were driving in the car together, I said do you mind if I share a few observations about our time together last week, I said they're kind of personal and they're a little bit about you.
[time=1966] They said no, I'd like to hear it, I'm thinking sure you do, yeah right, you're just trying to look spiritual.
[time=1977] I said you know is this situation said that and this situation and she said that and this situation and she said that.
[time=1988] She said yeah you're right, I know that, that's not good, that's been happening a while, I said I think that's true too, that has been happening for a while.
[time=2000] We talked about what that would promote in her, what kind of character that would build or not build, what kind of habits that would promote in her life.
[time=2009] And when I called him this week to get permission to share this even though I don't think there's any way you can figure out who it is or the situation involved but just so I don't violate a sense of privacy there.
[time=2019] I said to my permission to kind of share this in a generic way and the person said sure and in fact there's good news, I've been working with her on this and in fact she just got a spanking for that yesterday and she's doing it a whole lot less now.
[time=2032] And I was throwing my heart, I didn't tear us apart, I didn't ruin our relationship, there was an appeal from one brother to another brother to be the kind of brother that God wants him to be to his kids.
[time=2045] That is absolutely essential for a church to be strong, for a church to be mature, it's just simply not enough to have sound doctrine, it's not simply enough to have the right church order, the church polity, the church leadership, it's not enough to have biblical preaching.
[time=2061] It takes this, think of both situations I share, the one in which I was confronted, the one in which I talked to another person, think about it.
[time=2069] It's all Ephesians chapter 6 verse 4, "Fathers do not provoke your children to anger but bring them up in the nurture and the discipline of the Lord."
[time=2078] You know what, we both could quote that, we could both probably give you the Greek diagram on the sentence.
[time=2086] But it's when somebody stops you in your tracks and says, "Do you mind if I share with you, do you mind if I appeal to you for a minute, out of the specifics of your own strengths and weaknesses, the things that I have seen."
[time=2099] Man, it's like taking a nail, the truth of God and hammering it right into your heart.
[time=2106] It's just got to happen, it's got to happen.
[time=2113] You know, of all the people in the world who should be willing to deal with reality, it should be us, shouldn't it?
[time=2121] I mean aren't we the ones who have taken an honest look at our lives and said before a holy and a righteous God, I am a sinner?
[time=2131] There is no good thing in me, I am warped, I am perverted, I run from the truth, I run from the law of God, there is nothing in me of any value.
[time=2142] God forgive me of my sins, allow me to be born again through the provision and cry.
[time=2148] I mean aren't we the ones who have said that to the King of Kings, Lord of Lords, the Holy One, the righteous One?
[time=2153] So why are we so incredibly defensive when a fellow sinner, somebody else who has made the same confession to the same God comes and offers some feedback about how we're doing in our Christian walk?
[time=2166] It's pride, that's what it is, it's just pride and it's pretense.
[time=2171] And we suffer under the illusion that now that we've come to Christ and we're so many years old in the Lord where we have such in such a position that we don't struggle with those things anymore.
[time=2180] And somehow me and my Bible and my Holy Spirit were enough to get me where I ought to be, to make me look like Christ.
[time=2187] That's just all, not true. It's the Spirit of God, the Word of God and the people of God in meaningful relationship in your life that help bring you to conformity to Christ.
[time=2201] Chuck's window on his book, "Droping Your Guard" says it this way.
[time=2204] Okay, everybody masks off. There are times I want to stand up and make the announcement.
[time=2209] I've never done it, you understand, but I sure have been tempted. Can you imagine the reaction?
[time=2214] It would be a scary thing for most folks, especially those who have learned that survival comes a lot easier behind a mask.
[time=2222] There's a mask for whatever the occasion, have you noticed? No matter how you really feel, regardless of the truth, if you become skilled at hiding behind your guard, you don't have to hassle all the things that come with full disclosure.
[time=2234] You feel safe. What you lack in honesty, you make up for in pseudo security. If you wear an "I'm tough" mask, you don't have to worry about admitting how weak and frightened you actually are.
[time=2245] If you keep your "I'm holy" mask in place, you never need to bother with people wondering if you struggle with spirituality.
[time=2252] Furthermore, the "I'm cool" because I've got it all together, masks comes in handy if you resist stuff like hard questions, vulnerable admissions and straight talk.
[time=2260] Another familiar front is that I'm able to handle all this pain and pressure mask, not tears, not even a frown or a hint of bewilderment is revealed.
[time=2268] That one helps when you're surrounded by suspicious folks who are impressed with answers like, "Oh, I'm fine, I'm just claiming the victory."
[time=2275] A company by eyelids at half-mast and a nice, appropriate smile.
[time=2279] There are even the intellectual and scholarly masks that protect you from having to face the practical nitty-gritty.
[time=2285] It goes on, there's just one major difficulty in this mask-wearing game. It isn't real. It isn't real.
[time=2295] It therefore forces us to skate rather than to relate.
[time=2299] It promotes a phony baloney, make a good impression attitude instead of an honest realism that relieves and frees.
[time=2307] What's worse, as we hide the truth behind of a near polish to a high gloss, we become lonely instead of understood and loved for who we are.
[time=2317] True? True.
[time=2321] Perfectly true. The result, he says, distance, distance that makes you out of focus with me, removed from me by closed-off compartments that stay locked, keeping us from being able to know each other,
[time=2334] and went in where necessary to help each other. But the fact remains that distance must be removed if we hope to cope in this generation of excessive individualism.
[time=2344] We need each other. All the uncertainty notwithstanding the rewards of dropping your guard will far outweigh the risks involved. He's right.
[time=2354] Is there anybody in your life where together you pursue the dropping of your guard and begin to enter into the kind of encouragement and real relationship that is replete in the New Testament?
[time=2374] Not just parent-child relationships, how about the husband-wife relationship? You say you think we should be talking to each other to other couples about how they're doing in their marriage? Yes.
[time=2385] How about talking to the husband who is distant, aloof, sarcastic, and uncary?
[time=2391] You can see it. His wife can see it. Maybe he can see it and just doesn't have the encouragement to change. Maybe he doesn't see it.
[time=2399] How about the wife who is cool, shut down, defensive, withdrawn, or the husband who is weak and passive and disenfranchised from the needs and concerns of his family, or the wife who is dominating and controlling and manipulative?
[time=2415] Man, they have blind spots. You're there to help them see it. Deal with it. Coat with it. Change it.
[time=2425] Another best-selling author in America that day Larry Krab and his book Inside Out says it this way.
[time=2431] Apparently, we are to interact with one another on a daily basis in ways that help us see how our sinful hearts tend to operate.
[time=2438] I take it that it is my responsibility to know a few people well enough to form some ideas about the specific ways both obvious and subtle in which they violate the command to love.
[time=2450] And I am to allow myself in daily relationships to be known in the same way. Let my mass down to be known.
[time=2458] He goes on to describe the impersonal nature of so many Christian groups, groups of cordial folks who get along well and enjoy one other's company.
[time=2469] They may study the scriptures and pray together, but most of the members know they haven't been touched. Encourage perhaps instructed but not changed into people who powerfully penetrate others with the dynamic of Christian reality.
[time=2483] Christian truth. Now I'm not talking about legalism where people elevate their personal opinion to the level of scripture and go around imposing their personal views on everybody and evaluating their spirituality as to whether or not they keep the same little legalistic list that they happen to have in their own life.
[time=2503] I'm not talking about busy bodies, people who want to know the latest dirt on everybody else in the church and who stick his or her nose into the situation because they have some inter-compulsion to have the latest information on everybody.
[time=2515] I'm not talking about a cult that demands mindless conformity to a set of group standards or there is no acceptance.
[time=2523] Not talking about judging one another in which you come with your mind already made up, there's no listening, there's no information exchange, the verdict is in before the conversation begins and the goal is condemnation, not restoration.
[time=2535] Not talking about conditional love in which I love you if you act a certain way and our relationship is contingent upon you meeting my needs and doing what I want you to do such that I feel comfortable, meet my wishes, my desires.
[time=2548] Those are all the ugly ways in which we try to be close as Christians.
[time=2553] Instead we're talking about the appeal process of a genuine loving heart of encouragement that pursues and seeks meaningful levels of relationships that are full of fun, full of joy, full of the normal experiences of life, but have gone a step beyond that to give honest, critical, needed feedback about the condition of the other person's soul as it is evidenced in the relationships of their life.
[time=2577] We desperately need it.
[time=2582] Would you turn with me for a second so I can try to support this further and you're thinking over to Ephesians chapter 4?
[time=2590] Now remember, Timothy is at the church of Ephesus, same group of people here, same author Paul wrote both Ephesians chapter 4, verse 11.
[time=2605] This is very interesting, very consistent, Ephesians 4, 11 and he gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastor teachers.
[time=2619] Why? For the equipping of the saints. So I'll add, so the saints can do the work of service. What is that?
[time=2628] The building up of the body of Christ, the paracle-- oh, of the body of Christ, verse 13. How built up? Well, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=2646] Same exact sequence being called for. Timothy, in the book of 1 Timothy, the end of chapter 4, Timothy, preach the word, do your pastor teach your thing, declare the principles and the truths that are coming out of the Word of God, do it unequivocally, do it consistently, do it relentlessly, put people under obligation, do it with authority, do your pastor teach your thing, create the environment of truth, shield the people on their minds from an ungodly, humanistic culture that would tear them away from the true and living God?
[time=2675] Preach and teach, but realize something. Your preaching and your teaching is not enough. It's only when the saints take a hole of the work of the service. Is that my E.E. commitment? Well, it might be. Is that a wana? Is that children's division? Yeah, those are all parts of the work of the body of Christ.
[time=2693] But look at what's going on. It's a work of service to the building up of the body of Christ, until we have the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son of God, a mature man, to the measure of the stature which belongs to the, until we all look like Christ.
[time=2710] We need to be taking the principles of the Word of God that this church has stood for for 22 years, 23 years, and continues to reiterate and preach week after week, but it's got to be taken by you, and it's got to be given to the specific examples of your friends in the course of your lives.
[time=2726] And we're not going to be healthy as healthy as we ought to be. We won't see the continued unity of the faith and people progressing in the knowledge of the Son of God, to the mature man.
[time=2743] So it's simply not enough to have sound doctrine, good church order, biblical preaching.
[time=2753] The message of the New Testament is that we've got to have people in the church, all of us feeling the responsibility to be engaged, one with another in meaningful relationships.
[time=2764] Would you come back now to first Timothy as we kind of wrap this up? I want you to notice that nobody is outside the scope of this kind of involvement.
[time=2776] Do you not sharply rebuke an older man? How do you do that? Well, you appealed to him as though he was your father.
[time=2784] You speak to the older man as though he was your father, the one who has been providing for you all of your life, and probably introduced you to Christ by his Gandhi example, and then went on to lead a brave and courageous life, who demands respect.
[time=2797] Your father may not have been that way, but that's certainly the picture of a biblical father. He deserves that kind of respect.
[time=2803] So the older men are not beyond the scope of this command. As to younger men, as brothers at the end of verse 1, the younger men, all the guys that are coming up and kind of spreading their wings and taking hold of life and beginning to have a family and provide for their family, these all these young men, they need to be appealed to.
[time=2827] Like a brother, a position of equality, a position of eye to eye conversation, not that I loaded over you or you over me, not that I'm bigger or better, it's just you're my brother in Christ, I care about you.
[time=2840] Even as Jonathan cared for David and worked for his best interest and cautioned him and guarded him and informed him for his welfare.
[time=2850] So we should be relating one to another, younger men with younger men, and then the older women in verse 2 as mothers, the one who cared for you and provided for you and washed your clothes and made your meals and did all the endless things of care and concern to be sure that you got a good start in life.
[time=2869] How much more respect could anyone deserve than your mother, a tenderness, but she still needs to be appealed to, she still needs to be talked to, she can't be allowed to just run off into the folly of her blind spots and her willful sin.
[time=2885] And then it says, and the younger women as sisters, and here's the only kind of explanatory thing in all purity, in all purity, when a man or a pastor or a person in the church begins to talk to a younger woman about her spiritual condition, you're dealing with very intimate stuff, you're at a very intimate level.
[time=2909] You better think of her as you do your sister, the absence of any sexual interest, all purity. How many times have conversations begun, at least with what appeared to be genuine interest for another person's growth like Christ and the intent of the man's heart soon warped all that and the intimacy of those kinds of conversations degenerated down into nothing but a sexual interest?
[time=2936] Caution, protection, barriers, but everybody's within the scope because everybody needs it, everybody needs it, everybody is in desperate need of somebody who loves them enough to know their life and then give honest feedback and appeal for growth and relationship with Christ.
[time=2960] Let me give you three things. You want to do this? I want to be involved in this in your life. Three, just maybe as we close, real practical things.
[time=2969] Number one, it's kind of obvious. Number one is develop some close relationships, spend enough time with the same people over a period of time that you consider yourself close friends. A lot of you aren't doing that.
[time=2982] A lot of you are really isolated and you come and you go, you come and you go or you come often and you just make sure you get so many friends in your life, you really couldn't be considered close with any one or two.
[time=2995] And when you do start getting close at that level and they do start to see the chinks in your arm or they do start to see the problems and the way you relate with your wife or the way you relate with your kids, suddenly you don't see them for a month anymore, put the damper on that, leave that alone.
[time=3007] Then we'll get back in about two or three months, now that all that's kind of behind us and we'll kind of keep the facade going again.
[time=3014] That's just playing games, you're playing footsies with people.
[time=3018] Pursue some families, some relationships, some couples, if you're single, some other individuals, to the level that they have enough exposure to your life to see who you are.
[time=3028] Reality, secondly, make those confidential relationships, absolutely confidential relationships.
[time=3039] In other words, as you're getting to know each other and as you're beginning to see each other's weaknesses and faults along with all the fun and the stuff that goes on in normal relationships.
[time=3050] If the other couple doesn't have the assurance that you're not going to take and broadcast that to all everybody else that I'm not really interested in them knowing and they have no right to know.
[time=3060] If I fear that we've got a gossip here or somebody who would take that information and because of the thrill of telling it with a related or mutual friend would take and use that information about me, you can forget getting close to me.
[time=3074] I'm not here to be used, I need help, genuine real help, but I don't need to be exploited.
[time=3081] Relationships need to be confidential, you need to be quiet about what you saw, you need to stop sharing it with other people about what you saw.
[time=3090] If you're going to share it with anybody, share it with the person who did it in a loving, helpful way, there's too much stuff going on like that.
[time=3102] Number three, first, a close relationship, second, a confidential relationship, and third, invite feedback, invite feedback.
[time=3117] When you're together as adults and you're over a nice meal and a restaurant somewhere, why don't you say you know something we've really been desiring some honest feedback about our life, even about the way we relate.
[time=3129] And, you know, could we get together this time next week, and would you take the time between now and next week?
[time=3136] I mean, you've known us for five, six years, we've been on some vacations together, you see us, you know who we are.
[time=3143] Would your mind giving some honest feedback next week, maybe two or three things you think we could improve on?
[time=3153] Why not? Wouldn't you like to know? Wouldn't you be encouraged to know? I believe you want to change. I believe you want to grow. What is so threatening?
[time=3165] And then give feedback when it's requested. You've been in that situation where somebody occasionally might ask you, tell me, how do you think I handled that?
[time=3174] Oh, marvelously. Just marvel. You're just the paragon of handling tough situations. I couldn't have been in any better myself.
[time=3182] In a reality, you get in the car and, you know, tell your wife the 12 things the guy did wrong in that situation because you're really reluctant.
[time=3189] You're afraid, you're tinted.
[time=3192] Give honest feedback in the mode, not of a buke, but of appeal. Let me give two more thoughts on this feedback.
[time=3201] Two more thoughts on this feedback. First of all, it is not a commitment to total exposure.
[time=3205] Total exposure is not the goal. Loving encouragement is. In other words, I don't feel obligated to tell somebody all that I think about them.
[time=3215] That's not what I'm calling for. That's not what this text is calling for.
[time=3219] You only give them as much as you think. Well, help them at that moment. It's a subjective call. You'll make mistakes, I promise.
[time=3227] But there is no virtue in telling somebody everything you think about them. There is virtue in being selective and honest and caring and sensitive that you give them enough that you think they can actually handle.
[time=3241] And it may hurt them. It may cause a violent reaction from them. This stuff sometimes gets messy.
[time=3250] But again, it's not a commitment to total exposure. It's a commitment to loving feedback at a certain level that you subjectively hope and determine is the right level.
[time=3260] And then secondly, this feedback, there must be a sense of I'm pulling for you. I'm with you. I'm committed to you. We're in this together.
[time=3272] I share this with you because I love you. I share this with you because I'm committed to you. I don't know all the answers. I don't know that my observations are correct. I don't know that I'm not seeing this in some biased or bigoted way.
[time=3284] I really don't know, but I love you enough. And I'll risk it in my own life because I'm so committed to you to share with you how I perceive your relationship with your wife.
[time=3295] And how I think she's reacting and what I think it's doing to her and how it makes us feel we're around you.
[time=3307] But again, it's not rebuking. It's not boxing in. It's not stripping. It's not needlessly humiliating. It's not being overbearing.
[time=3318] It's loving feedback. You say, "Would Jesus ever do this?" I mean, would Jesus ever get involved in a conversation like this?
[time=3325] Well, come on, just as we close. Let's go to John, the end of the book of John.
[time=3330] The last chapter, John 21, his good friend Peter, they'd spent so much time together, they'd done so many great things, they'd conquered kingdoms, they'd done all the things that you do when you're with Jesus.
[time=3344] And Peter had made the Braggadocious comment that he would never deny the Lord.
[time=3351] And he said it in front of everybody else. And before the cock could crow three times, he'd done it. Or cock once, he'd done it.
[time=3362] And now, then Jesus has crucified, everybody scatters, everybody's terrified, everybody's full of fear and doubt, and there's a lack of faith. But Easter Sunday comes, and Jesus comes alive from the dead, and he gathers them all together, and he ministers to them, and he shows them his hands, and he holds them back until the Spirit of God will come, and then he sends them out to win the world for Christ.
[time=3384] But here on the side of the lake, we've got, in chapter 21 verse 15, we've got Jesus fixing breakfast. And when they'd finished...
[time=3393] I hope that you enjoyed the ministry of the sanctuary choir and orchestra today, as they sang a song with its theme coming from Psalm 27.
[time=3407] The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore, and continuing his series in 1 Timothy, and our soloist was Charlotte Schultz.
[time=3416] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3424] Our Father, I thank you that I can come to you today and bow my head and talk to you in the quietness of this hour.
[time=3432] I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins, and today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3440] I ask you to come in today and be my Savior. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=3447] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3459] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the package of 72 Bible character cards, please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3474] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request, tape number 1555, or mention the message by Pastor Russell Moore entitled "Respecting and Rebuking the Saints".
[time=3485] And please enclose a gift of $3 to help to free the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3497] The Bible Hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club, a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry.
