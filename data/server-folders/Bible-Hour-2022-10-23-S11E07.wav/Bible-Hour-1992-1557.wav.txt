[time=0] You know, I think I'm like most people when I want my life to have meaning, and as a
[time=6] Christian I want my faith to have a genuineness that carries on even after I'm gone, that impacts people's life.
[time=12] I think these same kind of thoughts are going through the mind of Moses as he stood before the people of Israel and gave them direction and instruction and how they could have a faith that would not
[time=22] be forgotten.
[time=23] Join us as we look at Deuteronomy chapter 6 and considering the kind of faith that will carry on a faith, it will not be forgotten.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will
[time=47] find to be an encouragement.
[time=48] Thank you for joining us.
[time=50] As we grow older, it seems that we become more interested in how people will remember us.
[time=55] That characteristic was also true for individuals in the Old Testament.
[time=59] In today's message, associate pastor Tim Tedder will examine a brief section of Moses life in a message she has entitled, "A Faith that Won't Be Forgotten." We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy.
[time=73] We will be looking in at chapter 6 verses 4 through 9.
[time=78] Our special music today includes our sanctuary choir singing a patriotic anthem and titled, "Pold the Flame of Freedom High." And just before Pastor Tim speaks, Brian Losen will be singing a song made popular by Wayne Watson entitled, "Water Color Ponies." As we begin our service today, Becky Woman reminds us that in this day of media and sports heroes,
[time=99] Jesus is the hero we need.
[time=113] [MUSIC - 215 seconds]
[time=346] Amen. Thank you, Becky. One of the advantages we have of having two services is hearing the songs a couple times and in the rehearsal because there is so much, so many of the songs,
[time=357] but the most important part of that line is that Jesus Christ lives forever.
[time=363] He's the hero that we need. He's the guide. He's our sustainer. He's our shepherd. He's our friend.
[time=370] And he is the flame of freedom that we hold high and just a few days we'll be talking about the celebration of our country's freedom.
[time=378] And as we think of that and as we get ready for the patriotic panorama, we also think about the freedom that we have in Christ.
[time=385] How important it is to hold that flame of freedom high, Jesus indeed makes us free.
[time=400] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=597] Hello and welcome to the Bible Hour Today.
[time=604] I think I need to begin this insert by apologizing for saying we had such great weather.
[time=609] It seems that in Indiana when you say something a little bit delayed, you're going to get caught because the weather has changed in the last three or four days from some 90 degrees down to 60 degrees, even 40 degrees, I think last night.
[time=622] So we certainly have a change of weather here, but we have a warm welcome for all of you that watch the Bible Hour every week, and we're glad that you stay tuned and watch it on a regular basis.
[time=633] Our pastor, Russell Moore, is on vacation right now. He's in California. He'll be speaking to a couple of assemblies and having some well-deserved rest time, and so he'll be gone from us today.
[time=645] I want to continue to tell you about our summer celebration that happens on Wednesday evenings here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. On July 1, we'll have Dr. Paul Dixon.
[time=655] Dr. Dixon is the president of Cedarville College in Cedarville, Ohio. He's been at our church a number of times. He's an outstanding speaker. I hope that you can join us for that event on Wednesday evening, July 1.
[time=667] And then if you're watching in Fort Wayne, you still have time to make plans to come to the Patriotic Panorama, Celebrate America.
[time=675] It's on Sunday, June 28th at 4 p.m. We hope that you can come and join with us as we celebrate the good news that God has honored this country. We're thankful for that, and we're thankful for our heritage in Christ too, as we sing songs not only about America, but about the wonderful salvation that we have in Jesus Christ.
[time=696] Especially event during that time will be a special gospel section, where not only the Black Hawk choir will be singing, but we will be joining with the Calvary Chapel choir from Fort Wayne, Indiana, a fine choir from downtown, and we just are excited about that opportunity to sing with them. That's an exciting day on Sunday, June 28th at 4 p.m.
[time=718] You just heard Brian Losson sing one of the songs that's entitled "Hold the flame of freedom high." While we are thankful for America, that song certainly has the theme of holding the flame of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, high so that the whole world can see it.
[time=734] I want to tell you just a little bit about our speaker for today. It's Tim Tetter. Tim is our associate pastor. We really appreciate his ministry to young people. He has a very, very active summer as he's taking junior hires to camp, and I think right now after this telecast, he'll be going with the senior high on a rafting trip to Virginia as a great program for young people.
[time=759] If you have young people in your home and they're kind of bored with the summer, you might have them check out the youth ministries, the turn point ministries. It's called at Black Hawk, and you can call the church for further information about all the youth activities that are taking place under the direction of Tim Tetter. He'll be speaking to us in just a few minutes.
[time=778] I've been amazed at the number of people that have written in for Bible character cards. We just have two more times that we're going to announce them. These cards, there are 72 cards in the pack. We'd like to have you receive them, their biblical characters, pictures of the characters, and then a brief description about their history and their place in the Bible.
[time=800] So you can receive these Bible character cards by writing to the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=821] We told you last week that we were temporarily out of stock, but that stock has come in now, so as soon as you write, our Secretary Marge Meade will get these cards in the mail to you so that you can use them with your children and grandchildren throughout the summer.
[time=837] We're going to go back to the live portion of our program now as we enjoy the ministry of music of Brian Losen, and then the message from our associate pastor, youth pastor, Tim Tetter. I hope that you'll stay tuned with us for the remainder of the Bible hour.
[time=867] There are watercolour ponies on my refrigerator door.
[time=895] And the shape of something I don't really recognize, brushed with careful little fingers, and put proudly on display, a reminder to us all of how time flies.
[time=925] Seems an endless mound of laundry and a stairway laced with toys, gives a blow by blow reminder of the war.
[time=945] That we fight for their well-being, for their greater understanding, to impart a holy reverence for the Lord.
[time=963] But baby, what will we do when it comes back to me and you? They look a little less like little girls every day.
[time=981] Oh, the pleasure of watching the children growing is mixed with a bitter cup of knowing the watercolour ponies will one day ride away.
[time=1003] And the vision can get so narrow as you view through your tiny world, and little victories can go by with no applause.
[time=1021] But in the greater evaluation, as they fly from your nest of love, may they mount up with wings as eagles for his cause.
[time=1043] Still, I wonder, baby, what will we do when it comes back to me and you? They look a little less like little girls every day.
[time=1061] Oh, the pleasure of watching the children growing is mixed with a bitter cup of knowing the watercolour ponies will one day.
[time=1081] One day ride away.
[time=1111] Thank you, Brian. I've had my share of watercolour ponies on my refrigerator door, along with crayon monsters and macaroni flowers and all those kinds of things that collect there.
[time=1129] I go to close refrigerator door and half of them fall off and usually what I do is gather them up and making sure none of the children are looking disposed of them in a proper place, you know, me otherwise you end up with so many of them.
[time=1142] You can't handle them, but I know that there's coming a time when I'll recall those pictures probably with the degree of sadness. It may be at a wedding, maybe alongside the bed of a child who's very sick.
[time=1162] I don't know what the occasion will be, but I know I'll look back and remember the watercolour ponies and the pictures and all those memories of the childhood and probably with some longing to go back and share all that again.
[time=1176] Because I think that's our nature as parents, children that we love and that we raise. You know, as I get older, I find myself more introspective, more reflective in regards to my life and to my family.
[time=1190] And I wonder what it is I'm passing on to my children. I wonder what it is I'm passing on to the people that I develop friendships with. I wonder what it is I'm passing on to the students, the juniors and senior hires that I've worked with for over 13 years.
[time=1207] I begin to think does my life really have meaning? I mean, I'm going to be 35 this summer if you go with the three score and 10. I'm halfway there folks. And I just wonder when I leave, do I leave anything worthwhile behind?
[time=1224] And most importantly is a Christian. Do I have the kind of faith that is going to be remembered, followed? Do I have the kind of faith that's going to be forgotten?
[time=1238] I wonder what kind of thoughts are going through the mind of Moses as he stood overlooking the people of Israel.
[time=1246] God had chosen him to lead the Israelites from their bondage to the Egyptians and led them to write up to the border the edge of the promised land. The spies were sent in to look over the area. They came back with their report and the people doubted the promises of God.
[time=1265] And you know the story that God judged them by saying this generation will not see the land I promised you will wander the wilderness for 40 years and it will be your children who will enjoy the inheritance.
[time=1277] We come to the book of Deuteronomy and that time has passed. They've wandered and they're about ready to go into the land that God has promised them and Moses stands over the people and he gives them a series of addresses.
[time=1290] And I just wonder what was going through his mind as he looked at this people. This people that at times he wished that he had nothing to do with. He asked God, you know, God, why have you given me leadership to such a rebellious complaining group of people?
[time=1308] And here they are ready to enter the land of promise and I wonder what was going through Moses's mind as he spoke to them. I think part of what he thought of and part of what his objective may have been and is speaking to them.
[time=1322] He was saying to the people he says, you're going on and I'm leaving you and I want to make sure that you have a faith that will not be forgotten, a faith that will be passed on from one generation to the next.
[time=1336] If you turn with me to Deuteronomy chapter 6, Moses has already spent time reviewing their wanderings in the wilderness and some of the events that has taken place.
[time=1347] And chapter 4, he gives them a call to faithfulness to God and then later on in that chapter and through chapter 5 he reviews the deck of log. He reviews the 10 commands that God has given the nation that summarizes their duty to follow and obey him to obey God.
[time=1369] And then he comes to chapter 6 and listen to the instruction he gives. Verse 1, these are the commands Moses says, the decrees and laws the Lord your God directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.
[time=1384] So that you, your children and their children after them may fear the Lord your God as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that I give you.
[time=1396] What was the hope of Moses' heart? What was his desire? Not just to give commands that would be followed by those people that he was addressing but to give the commands that would be followed not by just this generation but the generation that followed and the generation that followed after that.
[time=1411] He hoped to see in the life of the Israelites a quality of faith that would not be forgotten.
[time=1419] Wonder if Moses wondered, you know, as my life mattered, if I made any lasting difference, have I been able to pass on that quality of faith, a faith that's going to be followed into the next generation?
[time=1434] And I believe he begins to teach the Israelites to remind them of the qualities of faith that will be passed on.
[time=1442] And he says a number of things in the next chapters, but I just want to focus on a brief statement, a brief teaching, just a part of this that Moses gives in Deuteronomy chapter 6 verses 4 through 9.
[time=1454] And in this I think we see at least a summary of the kind of qualities of an unforgettable faith.
[time=1460] Would you read it with me beginning at verse 4 of Deuteronomy chapter 6?
[time=1465] Moses declares here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.
[time=1476] These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts, impress them on your children, talk about them when you sit at home, when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up.
[time=1487] Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads, write them on the door frames of your houses and on your gates.
[time=1498] This passage among the Jewish people is known as the Shema, comes from the Hebrew word here, which is the first word that we read.
[time=1507] Here, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. It is a passage that is often repeated by the Jewish people.
[time=1518] In fact Orthodox Jews repeat this passage almost daily as a prayer, as a recitation to God because of its truthfulness.
[time=1529] And I believe what Moses is teaching here, he's telling us that we can help draw the next generation to faithfulness by building these qualities of unforgettable faith into our lives.
[time=1541] We don't drive them to faithfulness, we don't command them to faithfulness, but we can draw them to faithfulness when these qualities of unforgettable faith are evident in our life.
[time=1552] What are the qualities of the unforgettable faith? And these verses, I just identify three things. The qualities of a faith that will not be forgotten is first of all faith that is based on truth.
[time=1563] Secondly, it is a faith that is driven by passion and thirdly, it is a faith that is lived with genuineness.
[time=1573] It is a faith that is based on truth, verse 4. The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[time=1584] Moses tells the people two things in regards to God here. The Lord is our God and the Lord is one God.
[time=1592] The Lord is a personal God, the Lord God that we serve as a God who has made a covenant with you.
[time=1599] Out of all the nations of the world, what did God choose to do? God chose to take a man, Abraham, and make a covenant and a promise with him that from him a nation would come that would be the people of God.
[time=1613] Moses reminds the people, "This God you serve is your God. You have a covenant. He is a personal God who cares and loves for you."
[time=1621] And not only that, he is the Lord is one God. He is the only God. He is unique. And this was a sharp contrast in comparison to the polytheism of the nations that surrounded the Israelites who believed in many different gods.
[time=1638] Moses said, "The God you worship is one God. He is the one true God. You're going to have a faith that's not forgotten. Make sure that your faith is based on truth."
[time=1648] I'm sure that the nations that surrounded Israel looked on their religion, looked on their God, and they must have thought that it was rather narrow-minded to not only believe in just one God, but to say that our one God is the only God.
[time=1660] Your God's don't matter. ours is the only one that really counts. But that's what Moses called the people to remember. The Lord is our God, the Lord is one God.
[time=1669] And over and over again as we read the story of the people going in and conquering the land, and as they established a kingdom, we see over and over how God shows Himself to be the one true God.
[time=1684] As it's tested over and over again, perhaps one of the most dramatic tests we find is when God, through His prophet Elijah, confronts the prophets of Bale. Remember that in 1 Kings chapter 18.
[time=1698] The people at this time, for the most part of the nation, and turned against God, they started focusing on other gods.
[time=1705] And so Elijah called these other false prophets to the test. And I think there were some 450 prophets of Bale that were called to Mount Carmel, and Elijah said, "I'll tell you what."
[time=1717] You want to find out who really is the true God. Well then you offer a sacrifice. We've got two bulls here. You take one bull, you offer it as a sacrifice to your God, and you pray to your God to accept this sacrifice.
[time=1728] And so we have the story and it's... I mean if we were there, it would almost be humorous to see these prophets of Bale taking on the challenge, putting this bull on the altar, and all morning they begin to chant, hear us, O Bale, hear us, answer our plea, answer our prayer, hoping that somehow Bale will do something to sacrifice to show that He's the real God. All morning, nothing happens.
[time=1752] Says by midday Elijah began to kind of taunt these false prophets, saying things like, "Well, maybe your God's a little busy." Or maybe he's sleeping, "Perhaps you should shout a little louder, try to wake him up." And so they did. They went to a greater frenzy, and it says they begin cutting themselves and dancing around, trying to awaken this God of Bale, nothing happened all day long. Elijah said, "It's enough."
[time=1775] It's my turn now. And the whole story of how He constructed this altar before God in order that four great pictures of water be brought and dumped over the altar and the wood and the bull on top so that everything was soaked. And He said, "Do it again. Four more pictures of water poured over the sacrifice. Do it one more time.
[time=1796] 12 large pictures of water so that everything was soaked and the water even filled the trench around the altar. And then Elijah simply said a prayer to God that said, "Prove yourself to be God to these people." And the fire came down. It says it consumed not only the sacrifice, but the wood and the stone and the water and the dirt and everything.
[time=1817] I mean, that was some show God proved himself to be the one and only God. And I don't know about you, but sometimes I wish God did the same thing in the same way today.
[time=1824] I mean, sometimes I just, I would like to prove something to some people. Maybe it's a little bit of pride. But when that person that stands there and kind of challenges what you believe, they're critical of you, don't you just kind of want to say, "Would you just step back about eight feet or so? I've got a little prayer. I'd like to...
[time=1839] Oh God, you know. Well, the fact is, some of the day is coming when every knee will bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, that there is one God, whether they recognize it now or not, they recognize the truth.
[time=1853] But if we want a faith that is passed on to the next generation, it needs to be based on truth. Otherwise, it's meaningless. It's empty.
[time=1861] Believe in the God who is our God, believe in the God who is one God. Moses goes on to say, "You want a faith that will not be forgotten, needs to be a faith that is driven by passion."
[time=1873] Faith that is driven by passion. See in verse 5, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength."
[time=1882] Jonathan, in other words, a great theologian said that seeking after God is the main business of the Christian life. I think that's what I mean by passion.
[time=1891] The seeking after God. I'm not talking about feeling. I'm not talking so much about emotion as I'm talking about a single-mindedness that drives me to pursue one goal. That's the passion.
[time=1902] That's what our faith ought to be. It ought to spring from inside of us, that single-mindedness as we pursue God.
[time=1911] We see it in other areas. When someone has that kind of single-mindedness to a particular sport, he really has a passion for basketball or baseball or whatever.
[time=1922] Someone who gives himself to their work because they have this goal of whatever is prestige or financial gain or security or to be the best at their job.
[time=1932] We see themselves giving themselves to it. We say, "Man, that person has a passion for their work." We describe relationships sometimes in terms of the passion of relationship as one person pursues another.
[time=1945] I can remember early in my college days as a sophomore standing up in front of a group of freshmen as I was leading them and singing.
[time=1952] And noticing in the second row this blonde-haired beauty, who I was sure someday was going to be my wife. And she ended up being my wife.
[time=1963] I thought that for about a dozen other women previously, but this time it was the real thing. But you know my passion was to pursue Connie.
[time=1975] I wanted to get to know her. That single-minded direction that drives us to a goal. And that's the kind of faith we ought to have. It ought to come from our heart.
[time=1985] That single-minded direction, it's passion-driven. It comes from inside. You know, contemporary faith and our church's day, it tends to be performance-driven, not passion-driven.
[time=1995] We focus on the externals. We focus on the performance, the duty, the work. We know that we're saved by grace, by faith. But somehow we think that now it's kind of left up to us to really do the work of the Christian life. And so we have to do the right things.
[time=2013] Folks, I really believe that from Old Testament on, what God was pleased with was a Christian life that grew out of a passionate heart, a heart of passion for God. Not just trying to do the right things, but having a right heart that resulted in a right life.
[time=2031] But we tend to focus on the external, instead of the internal. We tend to be performance-oriented. We work from the outside in. We think that I'll do the right things so I can become the right person.
[time=2043] When it ought to be no, I've become the right person. God has made me the right person so that I do the right things.
[time=2052] Real Christianity works from the inside out. But you know what? Performance is easier to measure, isn't it? Than passion? It's easier to put a handle on performance, whether we're doing that or not, then to go in and to measure, whether we have a passion for God in our hearts? How do you measure that?
[time=2070] And that was the trap the Pharisees fell into. God had given a number of commands. And some of them were a little bit ambiguous. God gave the command to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. You know, you work for six days on the seventh day you rest.
[time=2088] Okay, I mean, that's the heart of God. That's what he required. That's what he wanted and his people. But how do you measure that? How do you know whether someone is really observing and keeping holy and honoring the Sabbath day?
[time=2101] And so they began to add all these little descriptions and measurements of how you could know whether you were obeying the law of God.
[time=2108] You know what may be initially some of those were helpful to people. But what happened is they began to add on all these measurements, the measurements became the law. The measurements became the standard. People lost focus of what God desired instead focused in all these little measurements and the externals, the performance.
[time=2126] So now how do we know that we've kept the Sabbath day? Well, you count your steps. You can only walk so far on the Sabbath day or else you violated the command. That was all things that man added because we tend it's so much easier to measure those things and to measure the passion, the heart, the obedience of the heart.
[time=2143] And Jesus nailed the Pharisees for that kind of legalism. We tend to maybe fall in the same kind of trap.
[time=2151] I mean, we believe that Sundays ought to be special. It was a day that the early Christians came together to observe and to worship, to remember the resurrection of the Lord. It was a unique day for them. Some held it in a certain kind of a steam. Others practiced it in a different way.
[time=2166] But we come away thinking, well, it ought to be unique day. It ought to be a special day. It ought to be maybe have the same holiness as the Sabbath day had in the Old Testament.
[time=2176] Well, how can it be that for us? And some may decide, well, that means that I have six days to take care of business and duty. Maybe on the seventh, I should not mow my lawn. Maybe on Sunday, I shouldn't mow my grass. That's how I am going to try to keep this day unique and focused on God.
[time=2194] And because I make that decision for myself and my family, and it's right and proper for me to do, but what happens in a church or in a community where or standards like that become the norm, then we begin measuring other people by whether or not they mow the lawn on Sunday.
[time=2211] That becomes a standard. And we forget the whole point of the deal when we start looking at all the externals. Do you do that or not? That's how we measure people's spirituality. Instead of, but it's easier to do that, isn't it? Rather than where is my heart?
[time=2226] And you know what? It's easier to change the outside than it is to change the inside.
[time=2234] The Pharisees were diligent in being obedient on the outside, but Jesus said, hey, you know what? You're trying to clean the outside of the cup, but the inside is filthy.
[time=2243] You know where you start? You start on the inside of the cup. You clean that first and then the outside is clean as well.
[time=2248] He wasn't saying that the externals are necessarily wrong, but when you give attention to that, as your primary focus, God's not pleased with it.
[time=2255] Change should come from the inside out, Moses said, love the Lord, you God, with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength.
[time=2263] Our problem is we want techniques that will help us be successful in this spiritual life.
[time=2268] We're not so concerned about changed heart or changed character. We just want to know what things do I have to do to be successful in my Christian life?
[time=2275] And so we look for techniques. We look for performance that we can do that will make us spiritually successful.
[time=2281] And when that becomes our mindset, we fall into the trap of approaching even Scripture the wrong way. For example, let's say we become frustrated with our prayer life, and we want to develop a deep for prayer life.
[time=2292] We're not satisfied with where our prayer life is, and so we go to the gospels to examine the life of Christ, to see how He prayed.
[time=2301] Now we can do one of two things. We can look at the life of Christ to try to understand His passion and His heart, and to desire that same for ourselves, which would be proper to do, or we can go to life of Christ and try to look at His performance and His techniques to try to learn what are the things that we should do in order to be successful in our Christian life.
[time=2318] And if we did that in regards to prayer, we might come away thinking that, well, Luke chapter 5, it says that Jesus with Drew often withdrew to lonely places to pray.
[time=2328] So we would think, well, to have a successful prayer life, I've got to get into a lonely place. So we look for a lonely place.
[time=2335] And we try this spot in the next until we find a place where we feel a little lonely, and no one's around, and then we spend some time in prayer.
[time=2341] But you know after a while, if it's just been outward focus, it doesn't satisfy, and we wonder there must be something more, we go back, and we find in Mark chapter 6, it says he went up to a mountain to pray.
[time=2350] So we look around Indiana, and we're a little frustrated, maybe we have to take a little trip, a little vacation somewhere, we find a mountain, we go up in the mountain, and we spend some time in prayer.
[time=2359] And you know what, something's just as still isn't right. We go back to the gospel, and it says Jesus spent the night in prayer.
[time=2365] Oh, so we go to the mountain, we spend all night praying when it comes to the next morning, we're tired.
[time=2371] Because when it's only performance, when it's just the works, and it hasn't come from the heart, it's not going to get us anywhere.
[time=2378] And out of great frustration, we think there must be something Jesus did that we're missing, and we finally find it in Luke 22, when it says Jesus when he prayed, sweat drops of blood.
[time=2387] And we try to, well how can we do that? And I mean, see how ridiculous it gets to try to follow performance as a technique to living a spiritual life.
[time=2396] Performance flows out of our passion, out of our heart.
[time=2401] Moses says, you want a faith that will not be forgotten, that needs to be a faith that's based on truth, that needs to be a faith that's driven by passion.
[time=2407] And I question, I ask myself, and I've been asking other people this recently.
[time=2412] I've been frustrated, you know, I find those times of frustration in my life when I just feel like I'm doing all the things, but it's just dry.
[time=2421] Maybe it's Bible study, maybe it's prayer, maybe it's sharing Christ with someone, maybe it's teaching all those things are good, but I just feel like, you know, where's the joy of the Christian life?
[time=2431] And where's that life abundantly that Jesus promised me, it just seems like I'm like everybody else, I'm just doing all the right things, but when I just stop and I'm quiet, it's not satisfying me.
[time=2444] And I realize, in those times, when I'm honest with myself, I find that I tend to be living my Christian life on a performance driven basis, and my heart is somewhere else.
[time=2459] I've lost the passion, and I want to do the things for the right reasons.
[time=2464] I want my Christian life to be flowing from the inside out, not just to be something that's on the surface.
[time=2469] And so I began asking people, I said, what is it in your life that drives you back to that passion to God?
[time=2474] I've asked students that, that I've asked the staff that I work with that.
[time=2478] I've tried to just be quiet in my own life and try to evaluate my own life, what has it been the things that have driven me back to passion towards God?
[time=2485] Trying to understand through scripture, what are the things that bring passion to God?
[time=2489] And I don't think I have all the answers, but I think I'm learning. Let me just pass on a few thoughts.
[time=2496] How do I get a heart of passion? First of all, I believe this, a heart of passion comes from God.
[time=2503] I cannot create a heart of passion for godliness in my life, for righteousness, for doing the right things. That just doesn't come.
[time=2509] In fact, the Bible tells me that I run away from God, that in myself, before God took hold of me, I might have desired good things.
[time=2519] I might have desired morality, I might have desired, a lot of things that would be favorable, but I didn't desire God.
[time=2524] I want to do things my own way. Heart of passion from God comes because God gives it to me.
[time=2531] That is a work of grace of God. I don't earn it, I don't deserve it. God gives it to me.
[time=2535] It says in Ezekiel chapter 36, the promise God made to his people, he says, "I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you. I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
[time=2544] And I will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my loss."
[time=2551] God changed their heart.
[time=2553] Saint Corinthians 5 is described as being a new creation. God recreates us inside and in Philippians chapter 2 it says that it is God who works in us to will the passion of the heart and to act according to his good pleasure.
[time=2567] God gives us the passion of the heart, and if you're like most of us, if you can remember back when you first became a Christian, the passion of God was probably most evident, or at least one of the times was most evident in your life, was at that time.
[time=2580] When the passion of God was real, I mean it's just evident. I believe this. I believe that in life of every Christian that passion doesn't change. I believe that the very heart of who we are is Christian because God has recreated us, that passion remains, that objective, that direction towards God in this remains at the core of who I am as a child of God.
[time=2601] But you know, in my life, things get in the way of that. I turn my attention to other things. My focus changes.
[time=2613] And when that happens, things begin to cover over that passion. It's still there, but I don't sense it. I don't recognize it.
[time=2623] In fact, it may come to the point where I actually forget that it exists. But I believe in the heart of every true believer it remains. It doesn't go away.
[time=2635] And so I ask people, you know, what is it that brings that passion back and people have suggested these things. And I think they're good. I think they're true.
[time=2642] People said, you know what brings that passion back is remembering what God has done. Taking time to remember what God has done.
[time=2652] Because my passion comes because God first had a passion for me.
[time=2658] So I take time to meditate and reflect on the work of God. And as I reflect on that, I remember what God has done in my heart.
[time=2667] Others have said, and this is true in my life, how do I renew that passion for God by spending time with God?
[time=2675] I need to have time when I can just get alone to focus on who I am and what God is doing in me.
[time=2685] I need that time to be away. I need that time, whether it's spending time in the Word or prayer or worship or just contemplating and thinking, I need that.
[time=2695] And when I neglect that in my life, that passion tends to remain covered up. I mean, folks, listen, how many times did Jesus go away to be by Himself and spend time with God the Father to be alone?
[time=2706] He constantly did that, and if Jesus did that, I certainly need that in my life. I need the time alone. And that means I have to change my schedule of life, because I'm just too busy.
[time=2720] But if I don't do that, that sense of passion tends to leave me. Others have suggested too that spending time with people of passion encourages the passion in my own life, and that is certainly true.
[time=2729] Don't you know people that when you're around them, it's not what they do so much is the quality of their life, the character of their life that draws you to want to be like that.
[time=2738] If you met people like that, Christians like that, and you're around them, and just the quality of their life, you go away, not with a sense of guilt of, boy, you know, I don't have my devotions like she has her devotions or I don't do all these disciplines like so.
[time=2752] And so, no, we go away with a sense of refreshment and challenge of the quality, the character of their life that draws us to want to be like that.
[time=2761] We need to be around people like that, so that passion is stirred up in us.
[time=2767] One of the faith that's not forgotten, we have to have a faith that is driven by passion.
[time=2776] And I think Moses also tells the people, if you have a faith that's not forgotten, you need to have a faith that is lived with genuineness versus six through nine.
[time=2785] He tells them three things, a genuine faith I think is described in these verses by a faith that welcomes the word of God genuinely, not superficially.
[time=2795] It's a faith that teaches the truth of God genuinely, not superficially.
[time=2808] It says in verse six, these commands that I give you today are to be upon your heart, welcome the word of God genuinely, not just superficially, not just on the surface, but you are to embrace the word of God deeply.
[time=2821] It is to be in you, it is to be on your heart.
[time=2826] Too often we approach the word of God with the attitude, well, I know this is good for me, so I guess I better do it.
[time=2835] If the only reason we come to the word of God because somehow it must be good for me, so I'm going to do it.
[time=2841] Does that last very long for you?
[time=2845] When I was on swim team, I had a hard time finding a diet that would give me the right kind of energy and feed me when what I thought would be the right way and yet wouldn't make me sick when I go out and actually swim the laps.
[time=2860] I came up with a concoction, finally, and basically was taking a glass of milk and cracking three raw eggs into the glass of milk.
[time=2871] And once in a while I'd stern a little ice cream to cover up flavor, but I'd just stir this thing up and I don't know if it was that good.
[time=2877] I just thought it must be good for me, but I would drink that every morning and it didn't taste good.
[time=2884] It didn't feel good, and it was that kind of slimy, blandness that goes down your throat.
[time=2891] And in my approach to that, drink every morning was, you know, I'm going to do this because it must be good for me.
[time=2897] But I'll tell you, the first opportunity I had to not do that anymore, I quit doing it.
[time=2902] It certainly was not a joy of my life to look forward to that.
[time=2906] Sometimes the Word of God always thinks it's like swallowing raw eggs. That must be good for me, so I'll endure it. I'll do it.
[time=2912] I'll try to build this discipline into my life, but it's not really what I have a passion for doing.
[time=2921] See Moses told the people, he says, "First love the Lord, your God, and then take His Word into your heart deeply."
[time=2929] I would imagine that among most Christians, probably one of the most frustrating aspects of their life is their inability to develop a meaningful, regular interaction with the Word of God.
[time=2945] We try a method, and it works for a while, and then we quit.
[time=2949] Before we become part of a group that challenges us towards Bible study, we've maybe become accountable to a group of people, and as long as that accountability is there, we kind of stay with it, but when the accountability leaves and our discipline leaves.
[time=2963] Or maybe we sit under a message or a lesson or read a book that stirs up the guilt, because we know we're not spending the time in the Word of God that we should, and so we're driven by guilt for a while, but after we don't feel guilty anymore, when that doesn't drive us, we don't study the Word of God anymore.
[time=2978] When my Bible study becomes the goal that I am performance driven, when I think in my Christian life, for success in my Christian life is what I need.
[time=2991] I need to study the Word of God every day. When that becomes the goal of my life, I will fail. I fail every time. It doesn't last.
[time=3001] When Bible study becomes performance driven, I expect the Bible to do something for me. That's how I approach the Word of God.
[time=3010] I'm afraid I'll forfeit God's blessing, perhaps, if I don't do my Bible study. You know, I didn't have time to get in the Word today. My day's ruined.
[time=3018] That's performance driven. I'm expecting to get something out of what I do.
[time=3024] When my Bible study is the goal, when it's performance driven, I measure my spiritual condition on the basis of the time I've spent in God's Word.
[time=3032] Bible study becomes a joyless habit, and I quit. It doesn't last that long.
[time=3038] Now, I'm not trying to say that Bible study you shouldn't do it. I'm not trying to say that a daily, consistent habit of Bible study is wrong.
[time=3045] All I'm saying is that when it is the goal, just like any other spiritual discipline, when this becomes the goal, we've gotten things out of whack.
[time=3053] Moses said, "First of all, love the Lord your God with everything you've got, and then do these things. Performance comes out of passion."
[time=3061] And what God has been teaching me, you know, out of this frustration of trying to do the spiritual disciplines and never feeling like it's getting me anywhere.
[time=3068] And I end up just quitting. God has been teaching me. He says, "You know, you've got your focus wrong. That's not your objective. That is not your goal. Your goal is me. Your goal is a passion for God.
[time=3080] Your goal is to know God. Your goal is to draw close to God. Your goal is to have a heart of love for God.
[time=3087] And if that is my goal, if that is sincere to my goal, if I desire more than anything else to have a passion for God, to draw close for God, and by any means to make that happen, to have that happen in my life, you know what? This is going to happen.
[time=3102] Not because I have to do it because of what I think will come out of it, but because this is a means by which I know God.
[time=3109] When my goal is passion for God, then I find I share Christ not with people, not because it's my duty, and I have to do it, and I'll feel guilty if I don't.
[time=3118] But I share God with others because as I draw close to Him, and I understand and recognize the love He has for me, how can I help? Let's share that with other people.
[time=3129] I spend time in prayer, not because it's my duty to do it, because my day will be ruined if I don't. I spend time in prayer because I need that if I'm going to develop a passionate relationship with God.
[time=3141] All those things become natural results and natural means for realizing my objective, drawing close to God.
[time=3150] The performance grows out of the passion. Moses said, "Welcome the Word of God genuinely, not superficially." He also says in verse 7, he tells the people of Israel that they are to teach the truth of God.
[time=3167] New American standard says to teach these things diligently to your children, and the NIV, it says it's you need to impress them on your children, genuinely teach the truth of God.
[time=3181] Now we can do that superficially as well. In our homes, to our children, a superficial teaching the Word of God would be, when we'd simply rely on a once a week, or even once a day, gathering around the table and opening our daily bread,
[time=3195] and whatever we just choose to read, and you read that, and that becomes your family devotions. Now I'm not saying that's bad. That may be very good, may be very desirable, but when that is the objective, we've lost sight of the real purpose.
[time=3211] When that is the objective, your family devotions become dry, they become boring, and you'll probably quit.
[time=3220] When we teach the Word of God, when that springs from our passion, from God as a parent, when we have a passion for God, out of that will spring a natural teaching for God.
[time=3232] And here in this past, it says, talk about them when you sit at home, when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up. I see, you know, here, he's telling parents, you know, there's a purpose in what you're doing.
[time=3242] You want the truth to be understood by the next generation. You impress them, you teach these things to your children. Understand you have a purpose in doing this. It's not just a dude you have to perform, there's a purpose behind it.
[time=3255] The story of a man walking down the street, came to the corner, and the construction was taking place on the corner. And they're working side by side with three men, apparently doing the same job.
[time=3269] And the man asked the three construction workers, what are you guys doing? The first one, you know, replied rather matter of fact, well, I'm just laying bricks.
[time=3279] The other one said, I'm building a wall. The third set up responded proudly, I'm laying a great cathedral. It's a different perspective, a different understanding of their purpose.
[time=3294] And if we could go into a Christian home today, we might ask, a parent says, why are you doing what you're doing in this home?
[time=3300] One parent may say, well, you know, I'm just trying to survive. Another may say, well, I'm trying to provide what's best for my family.
[time=3307] I think it's the parent who best understands who is able to reply, I am raising children. There's a purpose behind what we do. We don't just do family devotions to do them.
[time=3319] In fact, you may not even do family devotions. I'll make a confession here. The Tedder family, at this time, with our four children, we do not have that time when we sit down with our four kids at a meal time and have family devotions.
[time=3331] I have parents that say, how can I develop family devotions in our home? I said, well, you know, that may be good for you, but what's more important, where you ought to start, is make sure that in your own life as a parent, you're developing a passion for God, and that you're able to communicate to that to your children.
[time=3348] Naturally, you're able to do it in every circumstance of life. Let God be teaching you through His Word and find opportunities just to, in conversation, share with your kids, you know what, I just read this in God's Word, and this is how He's been changing my life.
[time=3365] That's going to do more to teach your children than trying to sit them down and force them to listen to a five minute speech every week or every day.
[time=3373] Now, the other may grow out of the first. You may have meaningful, significant family devotion time, but that will be meaningful and significant if it grows out of the right kind of heart.
[time=3382] So I encourage parents, you know, develop your passion for God and find ways of communicating that to your children. I was riding my bikes with my kids the other just yesterday, and we were riding down the road, and for some reason the subject of weddings came up.
[time=3396] And my kids asked me, you know, Dad, when people get married, do they have to bike their parents?
[time=3407] I really enjoyed the ministry of music today, and I hope that you did too. We appreciate our musicians, Becky Wolman and Brian Larson, and our sanctuary choir for their ministry to us today.
[time=3420] The message was from our associate pastor Tim Tetter. If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment right now before we close and pray this prayer together.
[time=3433] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I need you as my Savior. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3444] In Jesus name I pray. Amen. If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3452] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
