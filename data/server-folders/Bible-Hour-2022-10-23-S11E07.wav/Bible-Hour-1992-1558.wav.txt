[time=0] Well this morning we come to a passage of Scripture which is particularly relevant to the pastor himself. The word of God this morning speaks to us about
[time=11] paying the pastor how to remunerate him for his services within the church and
[time=17] then it moves from that to the issue of how to deal with the pastor's sin. So it's remunerating and rebuking the pastor and the word of God finds itself to be remarkably relevant in a day such as ours we think of Jim Baker and others like him and their great downfall in Christianity by virtue of being improperly paid and not being rebuked for their sin by their own churches as they ought to have been.
[time=53] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. More so perhaps in past years but still true in some churches today being in the ministry meant not being paid very well. In contrast we've seen in the last few years what excesses can occur on the leader of the movement is paid too much and is not subjected to a proper level of scrutiny by his church. In continuation of his exposition of 1st Timothy, Pastor Moore will be examining these topics and a message he's entitled, "Pain and Protecting the Pastor." We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1st Timothy. We'll be looking in at chapter 5 verses 17 through 25. Our special music today features
[time=99] our sanctuary requires singing a patriotic number that presents a choral panorama of our great country entitled, "America, I still can hear your song." And just before Pastor Russ comes to speak, Keith Brotagom will be singing a medley of songs based on the passage from 2nd Chronicles 7-14 entitled, "If My People," which are called by My Name. As we begin our service today let's celebrate the birth of these United States. We hope you'll feel a tingle in your spine as Keith and star Brotagom sing, "God of our Fathers."
[time=138] "God of our Fathers, who's almighty hand, leads for the beauty of the sorry bell, of
[time=161] shining herbs, in splendor through the skies." Our grateful songs, before thy throne arise.
[time=179] I love divine, atleast let us in the past.
[time=191] Holy peace be mine, by the all of this glass, with our ruler.
[time=207] Gordian, guide and stay, thy world alone. Thy paths are chosen way.
[time=229] Refresh thy people, hung with toil some way. Leave us from night to never ending day.
[time=248] Fill all our lives with love and grace divine. And glory, Lord, and praise the ever thine.
[time=275] God of our Fathers, who's almighty hand, leads for the beauty of the sorry bell,
[time=295] shining herbs, in splendor through the skies. Our grateful songs, before thy throne arise.
[time=315] Our grateful songs, before thy throne arise.
[time=345] [APPLAUSE]
[time=375] "God of our Fathers, who's almighty hand, leads for the beauty of the sorry bell, of
[time=606] our Fathers.
[time=607] Thank you again for watching the Bible Hour today.
[time=608] We're indeed grateful that you send your cards and letters in letting us know that you're faithfully watching our program.
[time=615] Our pastor Russell Moore was gone last week if you watched our associate pastor Tim Tetter spoke and pastor you're back today, welcome back to Black Hawk.
[time=623] Thank you Peter.
[time=624] It's nice to be back and I wanted to say a special word of thanks to Tim for the fine job that he did in standing in for us.
[time=629] I was out in California speaking at a leadership retreat.
[time=633] It's for high school students that are going to be seniors that have been elected to their associated student body leadership, you know, president of the school or social coordinator, and it's a group of unbelieving kids.
[time=645] It's not a Christian camp, it's a secular camp and so we get to go there and minister and give basic principles of leadership and stand for the cause of Christ as our testimony kind of eeks out of our speeches as we speak there.
[time=656] So it was real good.
[time=657] I'm sure it was a great experience for you to be back in California but I'm sure it was good for those young men too.
[time=664] My son Andy was at boy state last week and he was thankful when the speaker got up.
[time=669] It happened to be a Baptist pastor that he said really gave the word.
[time=672] So that's neat and we appreciate those different opportunities other than church where we can really tell people about Christ.
[time=680] Speaking of refreshment, let's talk about our summer celebration.
[time=684] It's been on Wednesday nights here.
[time=686] We've had a number of wonderful speakers, Ron Scarf just finished a series and we had Dr. Paul Dixon from Cedarville College and this week we have a musical team.
[time=695] The white family on July 8th will be here at 7 o'clock at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=700] The white family happens to be black.
[time=703] They're wonderful family of young kids that sing as well as mom and dad.
[time=708] They'll be with us Wednesday evening July 8th.
[time=711] I hope that you can join with us for that great night in the middle of the week for some refreshment and some inspiring music.
[time=719] And then this is the last Sunday I'm going to talk about the Bible character cards.
[time=723] We've just had a record number of people write in for these cards, moms and dads writing for activities for the summer and grandparents are using these cards when their grandkids come over.
[time=734] So this is the last week that you can receive the 72 Bible character cards.
[time=739] You can receive them by writing to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=746] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=749] Once again, that's the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code
[time=755] is 46815.
[time=757] I'll also as we're taping this, we've finished the patriotic panorama and I know that there
[time=764] were a number of people that watched the Bible hour that come to those special events and we're grateful for that.
[time=769] Well, I think that's one of the blessings of the special events that we do at our church, like the living Christmas tree or the patriotic panorama.
[time=775] It gives folks from the Bible hour to come to our church on a periodic basis and we get
[time=781] to say hello and I want to say thanks to all of those of you who came and gave me the opportunity to greet you personally and we're always thankful even when I'm out at the gas station or at the market or wherever I am and you stop me and say hi and it's always a pleasure to meet you.
[time=795] So keep doing that.
[time=796] Well, we want to go back to the live portion of our program now with some more music from Keith and Starve Rodigham and then the message from our pastor, Teacher Russell Moore.
[time=805] I hope that you'll stay tuned for the remainder of our program.
[time=829] We walk before the Lord in faithfulness each day when we bow before his word, his statutes
[time=841] to obey.
[time=844] He promises to hear, he promises to heal and he promises to bless and to forgive.
[time=858] With my people who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face
[time=877] and turn from their wicked way, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin
[time=896] and will heal their land.
[time=911] We know of care that calls me from the Lord of care and it's the end, my Father's
[time=933] love, my Father's love, my Father's love, my Father's love, my Father's love, my Father's
[time=1078] Thank you, Keith, beautiful, beautiful voice, thank you, Scott, for the accompaniment.
[time=1084] Keith, as you know, is a professor in the music department at Huntington College and we're so thankful that both he and Star are a part of our church and faithfully ministering their gifts as they have opportunity.
[time=1095] Also I want to say thank you to Tim Tetter who filled the pulpit in my absence last week and I know and I've heard from many of you that you were ministered to in a significant way by Tim's message. He has such a heart for God and presents his relationship with Christ
[time=1109] in such an attractive way. I always enjoy hearing him teach. As often I have occasion to do that, he brings devotions and staff on a rotating basis and I'm always extra interested to hear what Tim has to say and his walk with the Lord. I want to say thank you to you as well for the week off. I had a great time in California for about seven days, the 17th of the 24th. I went there under the auspices of speaking to some high school students who
[time=1134] are going to be seniors next year. It's a leadership camp. They've been elected to student body offices in their high schools. It's a secular camp run by rotary and I have a chance to go there and talk about leadership and always leak my testimony into my messages
[time=1147] and really stand for the cause of Christ. But we have plenty of other time to see family and friends and we even got to play a little golf and then we played a little golf and
[time=1158] then we played a little more golf and then we 50 holes in one day just for those of you who are golfers. It was a great time with my dad. We got carts and ran around the course.
[time=1166] So I feel refreshed and I'm thankful to be back. And anticipating being back, I was thinking about my wife and my kids and everything but right there in the middle of it all was the privilege of opening the word of God again and sitting down in front of it for a great number of hours to try to seek and understand what God says to me and what He says to you.
[time=1185] And I must confess that when you're committed to preaching through a book, there are times when you land on a passage or two that you really wouldn't have picked for yourself. And that would be the case this morning. We're going to talk really everything you wanted to know about your pastor's salary but we're afraid to ask. That's the passage on us. Turn
[time=1206] with me. First Timothy chapter 5, everything you wanted to know about the pastor's salary
[time=1212] but we're afraid to ask. Chapter 5 starts this passage in verse 17 and it runs all the
[time=1218] way to chapter or verse 25. It begins with the pastor's salary and it makes a transition
[time=1225] in verse 19 and that begins the topic of everything you wanted to know about your pastor's sin but we're afraid to ask. So these are very vulnerable penetrating passages for the
[time=1235] guy who has to stand up and talk about them but because we're committed to do that systematically through the word of God, we'll just do our best. Look at verses 17 and 18, first Timothy chapter 5, it says this. Let the elders and as you know, the Bible interchangeably uses the word
[time=1252] elder, pastor and overseer. These are the same men with different titles. Let the elders or the pastors or the overseers who rule well be considered worthy of double honor. Especially
[time=1263] those who work hard at preaching and teaching. Verse 18, "For the Scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing, and the laborer is worthy of his wages.'" Then
[time=1275] the transition in verse 19 to talk about the pastor's sin, "Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses, those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning." When John Calvin
[time=1292] in 1556 had finished his commentary on the books of 1st and 2nd Timothy, he wrote in
[time=1298] the dedication this, "For everything in these letters is highly relevant to our own times,
[time=1306] and there is hardly anything needful for the building up of the church of Christ that cannot be drawn from them," namely 1st and 2nd Timothy. It's amazing that John Calvin
[time=1316] looking over the religious landscape of his day, his time, found the principles in this book
[time=1322] exceedingly relevant to his day. And we could agree some 450 years later. We could
[time=1328] look at the religious landscape of our day and names like Jim Baker would come to mind and the notion of the pastor's salary and the pastor's sin seems particularly relevant
[time=1339] in what is going on. And we could think about the building up of the church of Christ and
[time=1345] how we could draw principles from these passages and how we wish this kind of truth would have been prevalent and prevailing in his life before his enormous salary and unchecked sin became
[time=1357] not only national but international news and blotted the name of Christ wherever it was named. So it's relevant, it's important that we study it. And this morning we'll look
[time=1369] just at verses 17 and 18, the pastor's salary. Look again. Let the elders who rule well be
[time=1376] considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching, for the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing, and the labor is worthy of his wages." Now it's obvious from a first reading that the word salary or
[time=1392] income is nowhere mentioned with respect to the elder. And so you say, "Why is this about
[time=1398] his income?" I mean, how is it about his salary? Well, it's characteristic of the apostle Paul when he is talking about money to use words other than money. He doesn't say, "Pay
[time=1409] the money." He doesn't say, "Give them a salary." He doesn't say, "Put them on a payroll." He doesn't say, "establish them mid-range in the income bracket of the church or anything like that." He uses a very dignified uplifting, exonerating term, the word honor. That's
[time=1423] kind of almost euphemistic for both the money that the people would receive but more than that, the attitude and the people giving and receiving that money. It goes past the actual
[time=1434] material need itself and it talks about the attitude and the heart that is to characterize the giver and the receiver in this exchange. He used the same word in chapter 5 verse 3.
[time=1444] Remember when we studied that a few weeks ago? Honor widows who are widows indeed and this is talking about the financial support that widows who have no other means of support are to be cared for by the church. And instead of saying, "Give them money," instead of saying, "Pay them, X amount of dollars," he says, " Honor them." And wrapped up in that is the elevating notion of what it means for one Christian to support another Christian.
[time=1468] It's very dignified. Full of integrity. He did the same thing when he was talking to the Corinthian church about the money or the dollar bills or the coins that they would have sent down to the saints in Jerusalem who were struggling in that particular time of history.
[time=1484] He called their gift a grace gift. He called it a wealth of their liberality, a generous
[time=1490] gift, a bountiful gift. He referred to it as seed for sowing. In other words, it's not
[time=1496] just money, it's potential. It represents the opportunity to, like seed does when you throw it in the ground that it will bring forth a wonderful harvest. He also referred to their money as a harvest of righteousness. In other words, your righteousness, your maturity, your growth as a believer has come to the place that we harvest it now. There is a freedom in your life to give your money to meet the need of another. In this particular case, the need of a pastor as he does his work inside the church. It's a little bit along the lines of why we take the price tag off our gifts when we give them to each other at birthdays and at Christmas time. It's not that we, it's not that the value of that gift should never be known. It's just that that's not the principal part of the gift. What I'm saying to you in a gift is this is other things I think about you. I remembered you. I want you to have this. I hope this is appropriate for some need you may have had that I may have noticed. And if it happens to be an expensive gift, that doesn't go unnoticed, but that's not the flagship of the gift. That's the notion here. He's trying to elevate this whole thing,
[time=1558] get it above just the harsh reality of material support and talk about the love and the commitment
[time=1564] and the insight and the desire of a group of people to support their elders. When the
[time=1570] church at Philippi was supporting the Apostle Paul and he received the gift from them, he called it a fragrant aroma. He used spiritual worship terms. He called it an acceptable sacrifice.
[time=1582] He wanted the people understand that in giving him money, they were worshiping God. It was an expression of their love for God that met his physical need. And so that's the way it is. That's the way it should be viewed. Money is important, but it isn't everything. And Paul, by choosing this word, honor elevates the remuneration to more than money, to an attitude and a respect and
[time=1601] an appreciation and a high regard that is felt in the hearts of the people for those who lead them in ministry. I mean, after all, Paul has said he's making every intention to be a godly
[time=1612] man and he's calling Timothy to be the same. Look back at chapter 4 and remind yourselves of the
[time=1618] imperatives that are there for the effective pastor. In verse 6, he's pointing out the false doctrine.
[time=1625] He's sounding the alarm. He's nourished on the words of faith and sound doctrine. He's exercising
[time=1631] discipline in his life, but not so much physical, but really spiritual discipline. In verse 10, he labors
[time=1637] and he strives. He works hard at his ministry. In verse 12, he lives the truth that he teaches. He
[time=1643] practices that in speech, conduct, love, faith, and purity such that he is an example or a tupas that
[time=1650] everybody else could be patterned after. Remember in verse 14, he's not neglecting his spiritual gift,
[time=1656] but in 15, he takes pains with it. He's absorbed in it. He's trying to make progress. Verse 16, he's
[time=1662] paying close attention to himself and to his teaching. Kind of sums the whole thing up. This is a respectable guy. This is the kind of man that you could feel good about saying, yeah, I want to
[time=1672] support that ministry. I want to stand behind that ministry. And I want to do it not out of a sense of obligation, but out of a sense of honoring that commitment and that heart and that life and that perspective and that commitment of the kingdom of God. So very graciously and with great
[time=1688] wisdom, Paul elevates the whole thing up to another level, the right level, the proper level.
[time=1694] Now apparently some people have been raising a question, is it even legitimate or right to pay
[time=1701] a pastor in the church? I mean, shouldn't he serve for nothing? Maybe it was an influence of the
[time=1708] asceticism that was seeping into the church. Remember back in chapter 4 verse 3, these false teachers were propagating the forbidding of marriage, advocating of staining from foods. They were
[time=1719] saying you could work your way to heaven by abstaining from marriage, abstaining from foods. And maybe they were carrying that further and saying that leaders should take the vow of poverty and really have nothing by way of material needs and just live a very base subsistence way of life. And
[time=1735] so that may have been an influence. People may have been questioning the validity of even paying these men. Maybe they should have jobs outside the church and just volunteer their ministry and their spiritual gifts. Then that's an important question. It's a particularly important question. And today in light of how that's been abused. And the background for this passage, verses 17 and 18,
[time=1756] is found. And if you come with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 9, you'll find Paul's most
[time=1762] lengthy discussion of paying the pastor. This is all about remunerating the elder. And we need to
[time=1772] kind of put it in perspective with this passage. 1 Corinthians chapter 9, he begins with a somewhat
[time=1778] of a sarcastic question in verse 6, "Or do only Barnabas and I not have a right to refrain from
[time=1785] working?" We'll talk about this in a minute, but Barnabas and Paul were earning their own living.
[time=1790] But he goes on to say the other way that it can happen. Verse 7, "Who at any time serves as a soldier
[time=1796] at his own expense?" In other words, a guy runs off the battle to defend his country. Do you also
[time=1802] expect him to supply himself with his weapons of war and the food that he would eat while on his
[time=1808] campaign? No. That would be our responsibility to care for those needs. Verse 7, "Who plants a vineyard
[time=1815] and does not eat the fruit of it? Is it reasonable to expect a farmer to be toiling and working and laboring in the vineyard there and yet never participate in the fruit of it?" Verse 7, the end of it,
[time=1826] "Or who tends a flock and does not use the milk of the flock?" In other words, a shepherd who's
[time=1832] taking care of the herd and never gets to experience the benefit of his labors.
[time=1837] You wouldn't expect these men to be shepherds all day long for free and then have an additional
[time=1844] job on the outside to care for their family's needs. You wouldn't expect the farmer to work all day as a farmer and then have a second job on the outside to care for his family's needs because he didn't receive anything from his day-to-day labor. Verse 8, "I am not speaking these things according to human judgment. Am I or does not the law also say these things? Capital Alley is going to now bring a quote from the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 25 verse 4, it's there in verse 9, "For it is written in the
[time=1869] law of Moses, you shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing." That doesn't make any sense. You've
[time=1875] got this ox moving around on the threshing floor and he's beating out the viable, retainable grain.
[time=1881] You don't then muzzle him so he can enjoy the fruit of his labor. You feed him so he can continue to labor for you. Make sense. Verse 9, at the end of it, "God is not concerned about oxen, is he?" In other words, he's illustrating a truth, a principle. Take care of those who labor for you.
[time=1898] Then, verse 11, "If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if we should reap material
[time=1905] things from you?" He's saying, isn't it only natural that beings how we are the ones that in Paul's
[time=1911] case and the church at Corinth, Paul was sent out on this missionary journey to go to the city of Corinth where they likely had not heard the gospel before, the people he's writing to came to faith and Christ through his very ministry. They have Paul to thank for their salvation in a human perspective. Paul's the guy that led him to the Lord and he's saying, isn't it reasonable that if we
[time=1931] sowed spiritual things in you, would it be too much to ask that you should allow us to reap material things to care for our physical needs, as if to say the spiritual is far more valuable.
[time=1940] So it makes sense. It's just a very legitimate thing to do. Now verse 12 brings an interesting
[time=1948] perspective into this that we should look at. Verse 12, he says this, "If others share the
[time=1954] right over you, do we not more? Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things that
[time=1962] we may cause no hindrance to the gospel of Christ." What's he saying? You remember Paul was a tentmaker and when he came to the city of Corinth that's recorded in Acts chapter 18, he met up with Priscilla
[time=1973] and Aquila who were also tentmakers and they were in the same trade and Paul supported his ministry there by making tents. He never received any money from the people of Corinth for his ministry.
[time=1984] He worked on the side. In other words, he's saying it's right, it's normal, it's natural to pay your pastor, but you don't have to. The pastor may elect to have his job outside the church, earn his
[time=1995] living outside the church so as not to be a burden on the people. You can stay there in 1 Corinthians for a minute, but let me show you, even to the church at Ephesus, Acts chapter 20, when Paul was passing
[time=2006] through again and called them to the island of my litus, he said this, "I have coveted no one's
[time=2012] silver or gold or clothes. You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my own needs and to
[time=2018] the men who were with me." So he not only made enough for his own needs, he cared for those guys in
[time=2024] his pastoral party, those part on that missionary journey. Verse 35, "And everything I showed you that
[time=2030] by working hard in this manner, you must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive." So there are some elders
[time=2041] who will elect not to receive their compensation from the church, they will instead elect to be
[time=2047] remuterated in their secular employment, and that's a legitimate option. He's saying both are okay,
[time=2054] both are within the realm of possibility, and we have that here at our church. We have an elder board that we call our elders, and they are leading our church, and all those men on that board
[time=2066] are tent makers. All of them find their source of employment, their way to support their family
[time=2073] outside in the community. Another group of guys that we call staff who are qualified as elders and
[time=2079] lead as elders lead as our staff does that, we receive our pay, our remuneration, our way of living
[time=2087] from the church, from within the church. And either choice can be made. It is made as these men
[time=2093] look at the church and say, "I don't want to be a burden on the church budget." We couldn't afford that, and so I'll continue to work outside the church, and others of those guys are going to say, "I don't want to be on staff at the church. I would feel really restricted. My ministry is different than that. I want to be out in the work world. I want to be out here where I can interact with people who aren't Christians all day. That's my sphere of influence. That's my ministry." It's the same thing, though. They're all elders, they're all pastors, they're all teachers.
[time=2118] It's just that some receive their money inside the church, and some receive their money outside the church as tipmakers. 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 9, Paul says this,
[time=2128] "For you recall, brethren, our own labor and hardship, how working night and day, so as not
[time=2134] to be a burden to any of you, we proclaim to you the gospel of God. He never received any money from the church at Thessalonica, either." 2 Thessalonians 3-8, he later said more about it, "Norded we eat
[time=2146] anyone's bread without paying for it, even the most base level of his existence, his food, his bread. He bought because he had labored and a hardship. He was working night and day so that he
[time=2157] might not be a burden to any of you." So elders may choose to support themselves by working outside
[time=2164] the church as Paul did one because they don't want to burden the church and two because they feel that's their ministry, that's their sphere of influence. And as I've noted, we have both of those here in our church, both categories. In fact, this morning we watched one elder move from one category to the next. In Chuck, Chuck has been an elder, then has been a pastor, Chuck has been an
[time=2184] overseer of this church, but he's been a tentmaker elder. He's been earning his living at hires.
[time=2189] God works in his heart, God moves in the staff and the elder and the church and it says, "Now,
[time=2195] we want you to stop working there, we want you to start working over here and we'll take care of your support. We want your ministry full time and in exchange for that, we'll meet your physical needs." That's all that's happening. Look again now, 1 Corinthians 9, then verse 13, after he says in
[time=2213] verse 12 that we chose not to do it that way, we chose not to have you support us, we were tentmakers.
[time=2219] In verse 13 he comes back and says again, "Reaffirms the notion of being paid by the church." Do you not know that those who perform sacred services eat the food of the temple and those who attend regularly to the altar have their share with the altar, then verse 14, so also the Lord
[time=2234] directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel. That's kind of the end of the discussion on that one. The Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel. So it's affirming, it's reassuring that the way our church is organized is biblical.
[time=2252] When we have a pastoral staff and we have a budget and we approve that and parts of that money go to pay for those men and their family's needs, that's biblical. That's
[time=2263] within the realm of the way the church is to operate. Come back now to 1 Timothy.
[time=2267] 5, 1 Timothy 5, and you'll see that in verse 18 you've got both the old and the New Testament
[time=2279] supporting this truth. Verse 18 for the scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is
[time=2286] threshing." That's the exact same passage being referred to as in 1 Corinthians 9. That's the old Testament passage, Deuteronomy 25. Then it goes on in verse 18, "And the labor is worthy of his wages."
[time=2297] That's a quote of our Lord from Luke 10 and 7 when he sent out the disciples into the highways and
[time=2303] the byways. He said, "Don't be afraid to receive wages for your labor." It's okay. It's legitimate.
[time=2309] It's also encouraging to see both the old and the New Testament being referred to as scripture.
[time=2314] It's an apologetic for the inerrancy of the word of God that it's all inspired, that the word of God
[time=2320] is on par with itself, old and New Testament, and that they agree. So that's the general principle.
[time=2326] Now he goes a step further here. Look again at verse 17. He talks about some of the elders. Let
[time=2333] let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor. Rule well, it just means with
[time=2341] excellence or above and beyond the call of duty. He's saying that in any church there are going to be some among the elders. There'll be a few inside that group who will go above and beyond the call of duty. They'll serve with a greater interest than the others. They'll devote more time and energy. They'll be willing to make greater levels of personal sacrifice for the ministry. They'll
[time=2362] bear a deeper level of responsibility for what's going on. This isn't a discredit the other elders.
[time=2367] The other elders are qualified as we saw 1 Timothy 3. They're ministering, they're serving, but there will be some who, whether it's because they're more gifted spiritually or just as men have a greater capacity to handle broader spheres of influence inside the church, will distinguish
[time=2383] themselves as ruling well or ruling with excellence or ruling above and beyond the call of duty.
[time=2388] And instead of being jealous about those men referring to the other elders or the family,
[time=2395] instead of allowing that to cause bitter and envy and jealousy, instead of that, just grant them
[time=2402] double honor. You see it there in verse 17? Those who rule well, grant them double honor. Give them
[time=2408] an extra portion of respect and an extra portion of esteem and even an extra portion of financial
[time=2414] wherewithal because that is how you feel in your heart about them and the ministry they've had in your midst and the way that God is using them in that particular church. So it's not to be a point
[time=2424] of envy or jealousy. It's instead for all of us together to honor those particular men, especially
[time=2430] gifted in those ways. And then he cags on kind of a more particular element even further at the
[time=2436] end of verse 17, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. And this again, I just
[time=2442] think reflects the heart of Paul for the pastorate and for the ministry to be devoted as the central
[time=2448] part to the preaching and the teaching. Of course, we know this church in Ephesus to have been under attack with false doctrine. There were false teachers. And so it's even appropriate in light of their circumstances that the men that they would honor would be the ones who would work doubly hard or to the point of exhaustion at preaching and teaching and defending the faith. So it's a rather
[time=2467] straightforward little passage about paying your pastor. We've learned one that it's okay, it's fitting to pay the pastor. It's appropriate. As you would a soldier, as you would a farmer,
[time=2478] as you would a shepherd so you can your pastoral staff. It also implies that as the pastoral staff,
[time=2485] it's legitimate for us to accept that money. We shouldn't view that as some demeaning thing. We shouldn't view that as a handout. We shouldn't view that as a welfare. We should instead view that as
[time=2496] the soldier receives his pay, as the farmer receives his pay, as the shepherd receives his pay, so we receive our pay. And it helps us in our sense of dignity and feeling about the way we have
[time=2507] been treated and are remunerated. Oftentimes when I'll go places to speak, their question is do you
[time=2514] require an honorarium? And the answer is no. I don't require an honorarium. I don't ever set an
[time=2520] amount of an honorarium. If somebody gives an honorarium, I receive that with gratitude. I thank them for that as an expression of their thanks for the ministry, but there is never any type of condition on the ministry. That should be something they have in their heart to do if they choose to do that. Secondly, we've found that while all elders have the right to be paid by their church,
[time=2541] many will choose not to be paid by their church and instead will be tent makers. Instead, we'll find their their industry outside the church. Thirdly, we've found that above and beyond the normal call
[time=2553] of duty, some men will pursue the ministry and be gifted for the ministry such that they'll be distinguished as definitely leading the pack. And those men are just obviously worthy of double honor as opposed to jealousy and bitter and strife. Now, I had some questions that came to my mind,
[time=2569] that I wanted to answer. Questions that I thought you might have as you're thinking about this passage. The first one is this. You have said then that to honor your pastor includes paying him,
[time=2581] but it's far more than that. It's an attitude of the heart of respect, of appreciation.
[time=2587] Does the Bible give us any help more specifically as to how we honor the elders of our church
[time=2594] beyond their remuneration? What does that look like? How do you honor an elder? I mean, we're not
[time=2602] supposed to give them fancy titles and special seats and places of priority. We're not supposed to have preferential treatment as we have found other churches fall into, but what does it look like?
[time=2613] For us. Well, the answer is found in Hebrews. Come with me to Hebrews chapter 13. Very, very insightful
[time=2620] information as to how we are to honor the elder or two verses here that hit the nail right on the head.
[time=2630] You want to make a move in your heart to evaluate whether or not you're honoring those who you've
[time=2639] appointed to lead you and serve you as elders. Verse 7. Hebrews chapter 13 verse 7.
[time=2645] Remember those who led you who spoke the word of God to you and considering the result of their
[time=2654] conduct, what? Imitate their faith. You want to honor your elder? Imitate his faith. Obey like he
[time=2662] obeys. Serve like he serves. Give like he gives. Love God like he loves God. Study the word like he
[time=2669] studies the word. Raise your family like he raises his family. Be committed to the church the way that he is committed to the church. Evangelize like he evangelizes. In other words, the best way of honoring a man for his ministry is to imitate his faith. To take a hold of the things from the word of
[time=2685] God that he has given himself to and give yourself to it in a similar fashion. As I was thinking about
[time=2691] this, I was running my mind, the elders that I've gotten to know here at Blackhawk in the last 12 months and one of them came to mind with respect to a commitment to serve. In fact, two of them, I can think of that give over 20 hours a week to this church. Volunteer. Regularly. You know,
[time=2709] and it's not because they don't have other interests. It's not because they wouldn't like to do other things. It's that just they distinguish themselves in that way as as servants of this church and
[time=2719] they go above and beyond the call of duty, imitate that. Find room in your life to increase the
[time=2725] parameters of your service in this church. I was thinking of another category of giving and in
[time=2733] conversations with one of the elders and though no specific amounts are ever said because giving is
[time=2739] a personal issue, he mentioned to me and I was very challenged by it that at a certain point in his life, he and his wife said, okay, we're going to start at 10% of our gross. But we knew that the old
[time=2750] testament tithe was 23 and a third and so in an effort to go in that direction, we're just going to
[time=2758] add a percentage point to the amount we give every single year. Some of you are going, what? I mean,
[time=2766] he had kids, family, responsibilities, all the stuff, retirement, all the things that need to be
[time=2772] cared for. That's his situation too. He made it, he set up to 20% and they're still waiting for the
[time=2779] door to open so they can go all the way to 23%. Is that something mystical or magical or right about that? Not necessarily, but it sure does describe his heart and his desire to challenge himself and that family to continue to give and to excel in their love for God and for the church.
[time=2795] Imitate that. Imitate that. Follow that example of serving and giving and loving and caring and
[time=2802] shepherding. That's how you honor your elder, that's how you honor your elderboard. Now look at verse 17.
[time=2808] There's another way to do it. Verse 17 says, obey your leaders and submit to them for they keep watch
[time=2817] over your souls as those who will give an account, let them do this with joy and not with grief for this
[time=2823] would be unprofitable for you. Honor them by being submissive to their leadership by following their
[time=2829] lead. These are the men that you have held up to the criteria in 1 Timothy chapter 3. These are
[time=2835] the guys you have said are godly. These meet the requirements. These are our leaders. You have established them there. Now follow them. Don't make a mockery of their ministry. Instead give them
[time=2846] full joy as you responsively allow them to guide and lead the church and move with their wisdom
[time=2852] in their direction. And this is the mark of maturity. You know that. This is the mark of spiritual maturity.
[time=2861] Christ submitted the God. Christ obeyed God the Father, though he did not lack equality with him,
[time=2868] chose instead to be submissive to his leadership. The church is called to submit all of us together
[time=2874] to the leadership of Christ. The wife is called to submit to the husband. It's not a demeaning thing.
[time=2879] It's just the place that God has given in that divine chain of authority. Find your place under Romans 13. Submit to the government. That's a mark of spiritual maturity. And you honor your elder
[time=2890] by submitting an obeying and when one comes to you with some issue that he sees in your life or
[time=2896] you've been errant in your understanding of a doctrine or your practice of life. And he calls you
[time=2902] on that and leads you back into the knowledge of the truth obey and submit and follow so that his
[time=2909] ministry is full of joy not grief. So you say how can I honor the pastor in ways other than the
[time=2915] dollar bill? Well this is very clear. And by the way the situation behind this book, the book of
[time=2922] Hebrews, it's just a bunch of Hebrews. This is a bunch of Jews that have forsaken their way of
[time=2928] being brought up. They're no longer practicing Jews. They're now born again believers. And when they made that switch and embracing Christ, they were thrown out of their families. They wonder when all
[time=2939] kinds of social ostracism, many of them lost their jobs. So it's a whole lot more that Paul is asking
[time=2946] of these people to live in that culture and that day under that kind of persecution and honor the
[time=2952] men who taught them the word of God and who led them as elders by imitating their faith and obeying and submitting to them. But that's our challenge. And I would say what a joy it is. I mean that happens
[time=2963] here. That happens here big time. I remember the church that I was at before I came here was a small church of about 300 people and it was a long need of making some changes in the way they approached
[time=2976] the leadership of their church. And the deacons in this particular church brought the annual budget
[time=2983] to them. And it wasn't a big budget. I mean like ours is you know 1.6 million dollars. You could find a lot of room to maybe disagree with some points inside of a budget that size. This was a church of maybe a $60,000 budget. And these people all I don't know how many people were in the meeting. Maybe
[time=2998] a hundred of them sat there and bickered. I mean just bickered over the smallest little things as they
[time=3006] went down this budget line calling to question the leadership of these men who had faithfully been
[time=3012] involved and faithfully understood the issues and it made very wise choices as to the distribution of funds. But there was a very carnal attitude. Maybe you've been in one of these meetings and if you've been in one you never want to be in one again. There's no response, no respect, no follow-ship.
[time=3030] Well if you were here at our last business meeting a couple of weeks ago this family approved this budget of whatever it was 1.6 million dollars. There were two questions on the floor. Both of them were very insightful and very helpful and very positive and in 15 minutes the things approved and
[time=3045] were on with the work of the ministry. Why? Because you're a church that respects and follows and honors the men you put into leadership. So I just you know I mean that's great. It's the way to ought to be. It's a breath of fresh air. It's really a hallmark of our church. Second question I thought might be in
[time=3061] your mind. If honoring includes paying the pastor and the pastoral staff how are we doing?
[time=3069] Are we paying the men well? And I would say yes affirmative unquestionably on two different counts
[time=3077] came into my mind as I was thinking how I'd answer that question. Short term needs are met and met Amplie. All of us have plenty of food to eat and we have closed aware and you know what says in
[time=3088] first Timothy when you have food and clothing you should be what? Content. So our basic needs are
[time=3094] more than met above and beyond that all of us have the privilege of owning homes and cars and there's
[time=3100] extra money so we can pursue hobbies and various interests to stay refreshed and renewed and just be normal folk living our lives underneath and supporting that whole thing is a really strong health
[time=3112] insurance program that takes care of our needs. It's marvelous people are very very generous you are honoring us you are meeting our needs but beyond that you meet our needs on the long term basis a number
[time=3124] of you some years ago got together and said what are we doing for their retirement? How are we
[time=3131] providing for them after they're done when they've retired and so an annuity program was established and everybody who comes on staff is a part of that program and it's about I guess 5% of their
[time=3143] annual income not taken out of it but in addition to it is put into a special retirement account where it collects interest and grows and that's marvelous. I'm familiar with a pastor in another church
[time=3155] in this other church I was telling you about he's 70 years old gave his whole life to the ministry pastoring churches in Michigan and Ohio had moved out to be with his family out in California and was attending the church I was pastoring and one day we were just fellowshiping together and I asked him how he was doing financially and he said he barely makes it the churches that he worked that
[time=3174] barely paid him enough money to pay for rent nobody ever helped him get into a house so he could be able to pay off you know the equity or build equity and have some type of a nest egg there and
[time=3185] this is this is years ago this is 50 years ago when all that was happening they never paid him any
[time=3191] type of retirement fund that was never established for him it was just barely hand them out stuff and
[time=3197] now he's 70 years old he had a gardener three or four days a week live with his daughter and
[time=3204] preach whenever he could for an honorary and your heart breaks for the guy why didn't some church take
[time=3210] a hold of that situation see his needs and honor him in a way that would be fitting so that he could live a more dignified life and I'm thankful for my ministry here with you and I know the rest of the staff is you take care of us you honor us you allow us to have our needs met I can remember early in
[time=3228] the ministry Heidi and I when I was in seminary and we had two kids and man it was just as tight as
[time=3235] it could be you know we had some money that we saved up when we were both single and that was about $4,000 and that just disappeared out of our bank account over time and we sold a car just to kind of stay in there and be able to maintain our expenses and there were times where we'd be invited over to my sister's house 20 minutes away they had a pool and stuff and they were very hospitable to us and they would invite us over and we didn't have a gas money to get there I mean you know that's
[time=3259] how tight it can be when you're in seminary and you're kind of starting out and we're just miles from that now just miles from that where you folks have been generous and other churches and family and friends have surrounded us and I know that's true of the rest of our staff so be commended by me
[time=3275] today as a church that honors its staff another question that might have come to mind is it said in
[time=3283] that text especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching did you notice that it was kind of a kind of a especially not just those who rule well but then especially those who that work hard at preaching and teaching does that put the pastor teacher kind of in a special category or some unique status inside the church the answer is no it doesn't it really doesn't at all the
[time=3304] pastor teacher is one member on a team of men composed of staff and elders that give leadership
[time=3311] and direction of the church you just have to see more of this one particular guy because his ministry is preaching and teaching and the reflection here of special honor is by virtue of the hardship of that day and the need for that type of preaching but this is not some type of unique special status he's just an elder like everybody else is he's just a pastor like everybody else
[time=3334] though his ministry can be used in unique ways so it's it's not some weird thing you know we began by talking about the relevancy of this passage in the ministry and I was mentioning
[time=3348] people like Jim Baker and all these televangel schemes and I want you to know it's not everybody's not like that when I was cutting my teeth in the ministry as most of you know I had a chance to be on
[time=3359] staff where John MacArthur was the pastor and I noticed every now and then he'd have a like a new
[time=3365] briefcase or you have this you have a little something special over there and sometimes I'd look at that with envy you know I think man look at my briefcase you know my briefcase is from another era it worked but it wasn't cool you know and I'm just confessing a little bit of envy
[time=3382] there you know all that well I was so refreshed as I got to know the man especially in a day like
[time=3388] ours and I'll share this because of a day like ours do you realize at that time John MacArthur had we are indeed thankful that God has blessed this nation the United States of America our music
[time=3404] complemented that thought today as we heard music from our sanctuary choir and special guests
