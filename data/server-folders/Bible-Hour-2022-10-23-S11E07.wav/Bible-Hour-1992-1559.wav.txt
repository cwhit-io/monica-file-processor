[time=0] Well, the Word of God continues to prove itself to be remarkably applicable to the day in which we live.
[time=7] The passage we study this morning is about what the church is to do when its leadership falls into sin.
[time=14] And in a day like ours, when church leadership, church pastors, presidents of Christian colleges and seminaries are falling into sin at an alarming rate, this passage has much to say to us.
[time=28] Stay with us and we'll review what God's Word has to say about confronting church leadership that has fallen into sin.
[time=48] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=56] Dynamic growing churches usually have dynamic leaders, but what happens when the leader of the church is involved in sin? How is the church to respond?
[time=66] Join with us as we continue our study of 1 Timothy. Pastor Moore is continuing with part 2 of a message she entitled "Pain and Protecting the Pastor." We will find that God's Word is very relevant to the contemporary problems that confront churches and pastors today.
[time=82] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy. We will be looking in at chapter 5 verses 17-25.
[time=92] Our special music today features our sanctuary choir singing a patriotic number entitled "To Be an American."
[time=98] And just before Pastor Russ comes to speak, Denise Mitchell will be singing the song "Unshakable Kingdom."
[time=104] As we begin our service today, let's join Kevin Rowe as he sings "He Will Be There For You."
[time=122] In the beginning, before the world began, the great creator carved on mighty plan. He spoke the mountains, surrounded them with seas, then in his image created you and me.
[time=140] He already knew there would be no end to his love cause every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, 24 hours a day. He will be there for you.
[time=168] 365 days a year, every day in the life that you're here, wherever you go. He will be there for you.
[time=188] He's always listening before you even speak. He's got the answer before there's a need. He feels the heartache that no one ever sees. He's there beside you when you're on your knees.
[time=206] To me and to you, there will be no end to his love cause every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, 24 hours a day. He will be there for you.
[time=234] 365 days a year, every day in the life that you're here, wherever you go. He will be there for you.
[time=256] He will be there. He will be there. He will be there. He will be there. Cause every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, 24 hours a day.
[time=283] He will be there for you. 365 days a year, every day in the life that you're here, wherever you go. He will be there for you.
[time=304] Cause every second of every minute, every minute of every hour, 24 hours a day. He will be there for you.
[time=319] 365 days a year.
[time=400] He will be there for you. He will be there for you. He will be there for you.
[time=472] One nation under God is more than just a saying. In God we trust not merely token words. The freedoms we have known all come from Him alone.
[time=492] In humble gratitude our hearts are stirred. As Christians in this land now we must take a stand and lift God's word as true to every man.
[time=515] To the end of America is to rise and prosper.
[time=528] When they call you all the liberty with His word on the mission was made.
[time=541] To the end of America is to rise and prosper.
[time=570] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[time=596] His truth is marching on.
[time=603] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[time=641] We pledge our royal team to the truth that says, "Pray."
[time=655] Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah. Glory, glory, hallelujah.
[time=685] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour. We're so thankful that you're viewing the show today.
[time=691] I'm always thrilled in my heart when you see me out at the market or at the gas station and you take a minute, introduce yourself and say, "I'm so-and-so and we've been faithfully watching the Bible Hour."
[time=702] It's always an encouragement to know that there are folks like you who are committed to understanding and thinking through the issues in the Word of God as well as enjoying the music that we have here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=713] We hope you're enjoying your summer. We trust that you're spending summer the extra time that you have with your family and that things are going well for you.
[time=720] Well, this morning we have one of my best friends in the whole state of Indiana, Steve Longbreak, with us this morning and Steve is the principal of Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=729] Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Pastor Russell.
[time=731] If I was in your office and I was thinking about enrolling my child in your school, which of course I've enrolled all that I can, three of the four and will eventually enrolled the four.
[time=743] But if I were unfamiliar with Christian education and I was curious, tell me why I should spend the money to send my child to Christian education or to your school.
[time=755] You know, I have parents ask me that often and I love to give the answer because I think it can change everybody's life in the family.
[time=764] The Word of God is so powerful and able to change people's lives that at every level and every point in a child's life that we can inject the Bible into what they're learning and what they're doing, their decision making.
[time=780] We're helping them to grow up to be better adults, better equipped to serve God.
[time=784] So the Lord being paramount in our school is the reason that we have a school.
[time=789] We have strong academics because that's a byproduct of making sure that we follow the principles that the Bible has laid down for us.
[time=797] And our teachers who love God feel accountable to Him and they want to do the best that they can for those children to serve the Lord.
[time=806] And so they every single day work at injecting the truth of what the Bible has to say about mathematics, English history, every one of the subject areas.
[time=816] And then the decision making that children have in their own lives.
[time=819] And secondly, I'd say that I love for our children to have the opportunity to meet each other, to be involved in other families that have a kindred spirit that have like philosophies and they want what's offered to them in the school.
[time=831] And so every day we try to build up those relationships and encourage those children to have those friends and those families.
[time=838] And those two things working together, helping parents, is the reason that we exist with a philosophy that's different.
[time=844] We say that God is essential in a child's life and that offsets a lot of bad input that they have in other areas of their life.
[time=852] Well, I've already seen that happening in my daughter's lives and I appreciate the commitment to academics that the school has.
[time=861] My eldest daughter, Randy, has never read more.
[time=863] She's never been more involved and committed to her studies and getting things done on time and the reports that are required in the tests and the positive feedback that she gets from happy who has been her teacher last year have made all the difference in the world with her.
[time=877] How are we doing as far as openings? I know the school is pretty well full in most grades but there are some openings, aren't there?
[time=885] Yes, we still have openings in first grade through fourth grade because we've begun to double track our elementary school and preparation for having a school twice the size that we had five years ago.
[time=897] Our kindergarten is full but only one person on the waiting list so people should still enroll for kindergarten.
[time=903] But grades one through four, they do have openings.
[time=907] And to enroll a child we would just call the church 493-7400.
[time=913] That's right. Yeah, that's 493-7400. Just call the church. It's the same number for the school and then ask for the school office and we can give you the information from there.
[time=922] We're building a new building. Tell us about how that's coming and what you're excited about is with regard to that.
[time=928] Our church families and our school families together are working to construct a new building. They provided funds to allow a contractor and his subcontractors to put together a great building with a gem in 10 classrooms.
[time=943] And that's about the midway point now. We'll be ready after the school year has started to move into that facility. It's going to be a great seven through 12 building while we begin to grow.
[time=953] And I'm really thankful for that building. It is a great place to teach kids a great science lab, really nice gymnasium facilities and computer, everything that we really want. I'm grateful. The Lord's provided.
[time=966] Yeah, we're both excited. I mean, 33,000 square feet of brand new facility to just make the whole environment happen as far as what we're trying to accomplish in their lives.
[time=977] Well, thanks, Steve. Thanks for your work. Thanks for your ministry. And I can't encourage you enough. I mean, genuinely from my heart, if you're at a decision point as to what to do with your child and you see the influences of an unguidly culture taking inroads into your family and into your relationship with your young person.
[time=995] I really consider the school as a viable option to give the added strength and support to see a razor child in the way that God would have you do that.
[time=1005] Talking about raising children, we have a book kind of as an offer for you today. It's entitled How to Grow a Happy Family by Audi Gattis.
[time=1012] And it's a tremendous little book that'll really give you help you establish a plan and set some priorities and some goals as to how to make your family what God wants it to be.
[time=1023] Sometimes we don't do that just because we're not prompted to set goals and maybe establish a plan and look for a way to accomplish some of the Christian distinctives that should be ours as believers.
[time=1035] I think this book would be another little helpful tool. And if you'll write to us, we'd be happy to send it to you free of charge.
[time=1041] But you'd write to us or call us the Bible Hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. The Bible Hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=1056] And again, you can call us at the same number 493 7400. We'd be happy to take the information and send you the book.
[time=1063] Well, again, thank you for being with us today and we'll return now to the regular portion of our worship service.
[time=1071] [MUSIC - 6 seconds]
[time=1085] They came to follow here drawn by a widely promised thing if they would sell all that they had.
[time=1105] He said that God would send a kingdom that would never end where all the hope would be so rich.
[time=1129] And in their discontent they heard what they thought he meant.
[time=1141] And heard that the weak would be strong.
[time=1153] Bread would be multiplied and hunger satisfied and every servant a king.
[time=1173] In this kingdom of God a kingdom that would never end only living on shakeable kingdom of God.
[time=1201] [MUSIC]
[time=1207] But he went his quiet way giving himself away building what eyes could never see.
[time=1229] While men looked for crowded roads he walked with crowd alone planting a sea in and in.
[time=1251] Crying with those who cried dying for those who died bursting forth glorified alive.
[time=1271] Still some of them looked for him said that it had to end but they dare to look within and see.
[time=1291] The kingdom of God, the kingdom that would never end are living on shakeable kingdom of God.
[time=1319] Still some of us look for him said that it had to end.
[time=1329] Will you dare to look within and see?
[time=1339] The kingdom of God, the kingdom that will never end are living on shakeable living on shakeable.
[time=1367] [MUSIC]
[time=1387] Thank you, Denise, beautiful song, beautiful voice.
[time=1397] We're thankful for your ministry.
[time=1399] Well, would you take your bibles with me this morning and open to 1 Timothy chapter 5.
[time=1405] And if you're new with us this morning visiting you need to know we're in the process of studying the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=1411] We're going through it verse by verse chapter by chapter and we come this morning to a series of verses that really are relevant and vital for the church in America today.
[time=1425] 1 Timothy chapter 5 verses 19 and 20.
[time=1431] Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of 2 or 3 witnesses.
[time=1439] Those who continue in sin rebuke in the presence of all so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning.
[time=1447] What is a church to do when there is sin in the leadership?
[time=1452] When the most dedicated, the most committed, the most mature, the most qualified, the ones who have been taught, the ones who have been discipled, the ones who have been trained, the ones who have been set apart into the ministry,
[time=1468] and are now in the process themselves of teaching others and discipling others and training others and setting others apart into the ministry.
[time=1476] What are we to do when those who are setting the standard, when those who are out in front and really setting the spiritual pace for the body and believers, what are we to do when an elder sins?
[time=1487] How is the church to respond and react to that?
[time=1490] When the leadership has lost its passion for victory and the cause of Christ and been distracted by the things of the world, the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh and the boastful pride of life.
[time=1502] Those worldly things have found preeminent in his heart and mind that he has fallen into sin.
[time=1509] Men who have made sinful choices in their personal lives to the extent that now their leadership in the church is compromised, and if it's relevant for us today, you can be sure it was relevant for Paul and for Timothy.
[time=1523] For the setting behind these verses is a church, many churches, house churches in the city of Ephesus that as Paul had promised them in the book of Acts, what after his departure be infiltrated by savage wolves, men in leadership who would come with unsound doctrine and unsound character and ungodly lives, and he would infiltrate the church and rob the church even of the gospel itself and turn it into nothing but an orthodox church, an empty church.
[time=1549] A church without the vibrant relationship in Christ because it is aired in the true gospel in its leadership does not live a holy, godly, pure life.
[time=1559] And you know the development of the book, we've been studying it Paul began in chapter 1 by confronting the false doctrine and clarifying once and for all in that church and in those churches what the true gospel is, embracing Christ through faith, being saved by grace.
[time=1574] And in that way, very pointedly culminating chapter 1 by even identifying two men, Hymenaeus and Alexandra as those who were leading the pack in this propagation of false doctrine, but where there is false teaching inside of man's heart there is ungodly living in his life.
[time=1590] And so Paul goes on to debunk them by lifting up first Timothy chapter 3 and the whole standard of character for true leadership inside the church and lifts them up as men who must be above approach.
[time=1602] And so in the development of thought and the argument of the book, he first clarifies false doctrine versus true doctrine, then he holds up the template of godliness that elders are to be measured against, but here in this passage is if he's saying now that I've given you the true doctrine and the true character, examine those who are in leadership and this is what you do when you find out they don't make it.
[time=1623] This is how you treat them, this is how you handle the situation when you have men in leadership who don't belong in leadership.
[time=1631] And so he becomes immensely practical at this point.
[time=1636] When you evaluate your elders in your church by the standard that I have given you both in doctrine and in character and you find they do not measure up, the question is what do we do?
[time=1646] How do we handle it? And this passage answers the question.
[time=1651] So Paul gives us here in these few verses and really the passage goes all to verse 25 and will eventually study all of it, but in these first beginning verses he gives us the elements of church discipline for an elder.
[time=1666] Now whenever you bring up the notion of church discipline, it is for some a very distasteful topic. They become uneasy, they aren't really sure this is what the church should be involved in.
[time=1678] And it conjures mental images in many people's minds of a legalistic, meddling, judge mental, controlling bunch of people who have their nose and other people's business, private business.
[time=1689] And I would say if you're in that camp this morning, then this message really these series of messages are for you, because it will give you an opportunity to review not only this text here in 1 Timothy 5, but the other two major texts in the word of God and the New Testament that deal with sin in the church.
[time=1707] There are really only three major passages that deal with this concept of church discipline. One of them is in front of you, 1 Timothy 5.
[time=1715] The other is Galatians 6 and the other one is Matthew 18. And before we're done, we will have reviewed all of them.
[time=1722] And in fact, we must start not here in 1 Timothy, but we'll start in Galatians chapter 6. And so if you will, take a moment to turn with me to Galatians 6 because that's where we're going to spend the rest of the morning.
[time=1736] And it's necessary for us to understand the broader context of church discipline before we try to understand specifically what to do with elders who have sin.
[time=1746] There's a whole backdrop. There's a whole really doctrine or theology of how to deal with people who have fallen and sin which must first be laid before we can understand how we're supposed to treat those who are at the top of the spiritual ladder.
[time=1760] Really the bottom of a pyramid because they're servants. So if from Galatians 6.6 as we'll find we will learn brother to brother church discipline.
[time=1770] In Matthew 18 we'll find out brother to church, church discipline. And finally we'll come back to 1 Timothy 5 and find out how the church is to discipline the elder.
[time=1779] But these are building blocks that must be laid. And so really happily we'll take the time even this morning to lay the first building block.
[time=1788] And if you've not been exposed to this kind of thinking, if you've not been exposed to this passage, I think you'll find that unbelievably clear.
[time=1795] And it's a healthy passage, it's a restorative passage, it is a passage that brings life and health and energy and strength and godliness and purity and involvement people to people inside the church.
[time=1810] And I can't think as I have said of any more relevant passage for our day and age, church has crept in, excuse me sin has crept into the church in an unbelievable way, especially in the last couple of decades.
[time=1823] The churches of America are compromising, they are tolerant, they are accepting of people and their sin when they shouldn't be.
[time=1831] There couldn't be a more needed passage for us to study and at the same time a tougher one to apply.
[time=1838] And you'll find as we get involved in these passages that those who are brave enough and courageous enough and willing to be involved in the process of church discipline are in for the ride of their lives.
[time=1853] Galatians 6 verses 1 through 6. Now this is the most basic instruction in all the New Testament about church discipline or about restoring a fallen brother.
[time=1863] And it may be helpful for you to think through this passage in light of someone you know, whether it's a family member, whether it's a spouse, whether it's a child, whether it is someone in this church, whether it's someone in another church, anybody who bears the name Brethren, chapter 6 verse 1.
[time=1880] Anybody who's a believer is in view in this passage. This isn't specifically about elders or deacons or staff members or even members of the same church. This passage is about any Christian interacting with any other Christian anywhere in the world.
[time=1896] So while it may include a pastor or an elder or a deacon or a staff member, and certainly it's the groundwork or the framework for such a discussion, it's not limited to them and it would encompass friends, spouse, parents, grandparents, children, siblings.
[time=1917] And again, as I say, everybody and anybody who names the name of Christ, it is without bounds, it is without limits.
[time=1926] And I would invite you to think of someone in your life, again to make this as relevant as possible in your own time here with us this morning, someone who needs restoration, someone who is in sin, and maybe identify that name and that person and that scenario.
[time=1941] He begins in verse 1, brethren, "Even if a man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, each one looking to yourself, lest you to be tempted."
[time=1954] Now the first question that comes to people's minds when they want to talk about church discipline is what would be the sins, what would be the list of sins or the categories of sins that would merit church discipline, that would merit this kind of restorative action, that would merit me talking to someone else or someone else talking to me about my sin.
[time=1974] Well the word is trespass, you see it there in verse 1, and it means to step off the path, it means to have been walking on a path and then to step off that path.
[time=1987] And we may envision even just as a visual aid, this middle aisle here in the church.
[time=1993] It says if somebody or a group of people have been walking along this path and for some reason have chosen to step off the path and have gone down one of these aisles.
[time=2001] They are no longer on the main path. That's all the word trespass means. Step off the path.
[time=2006] But you have to ask yourself, well what path? And you could import a meaning from some other place in Scripture but you don't need to because it's right here in the immediate context.
[time=2015] The metaphor is that of walking along a path, come with me to chapter 5, verse 25, just glance your eyes up a few lines on the page.
[time=2024] If we live by the Spirit, let us also what? Walk by the Spirit. This is a description of people who have been walking by the Spirit of God.
[time=2036] That's the path on which they are. They're walking in the Spirit of God. They're led by the Spirit of God. They're believers whose lives are being directed and led by the Spirit of God.
[time=2044] And they have chosen to step off that path into a different way of walk and you say, well what is that? Well that is also very clearly explained to us, chapter 5, verse 16.
[time=2054] We'll just go back a little bit and grab some more of the context. But I say walk by the Spirit and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh.
[time=2062] Verse 17 for the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh for these are in opposition to one another so that you may not do the things that you please.
[time=2071] But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. So it's obvious the path is either the path that is being led and directed by the Spirit of God or there is another path that is in opposition to it called the path of the flesh because the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit.
[time=2090] So in other words, the scope of church discipline, the scope of restorative action includes anyone who is involved in behavior that is not defined as walking by the Spirit of God on this path but has stepped off into another path called the path of the flesh.
[time=2104] And you say, well could you define that fleshly path for us? The answer is yes. Look at verse 19, chapter 5.
[time=2112] Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, entities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissentions, factions, inving, drunkenness, corousing, the things like these of which I forewarned you, just as I have forewarned you that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
[time=2139] So there is a representative list, it's not a comprehensive list because you'll notice he says there, things like these at the end of verse 21, those who practice such things at the beginning of verse 21, inving, drunkenness, corousing, and things like these.
[time=2157] This is merely a representation of the kinds of deeds that people do when they are off the path of the Spirit of God and on to the path of the flesh.
[time=2167] And the question comes, well then what does it look like when you're on the path of the Spirit of God? What does that look like? Well that's verses 22 and following.
[time=2176] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, against such things, there is no law.
[time=2188] So it couldn't be any clearer. Paul in the immediate context of chapter 5 verses 16 to 26 is describing two different walks that are in absolute opposition to each other.
[time=2201] One is the walk of the Spirit of God, one is the walk of the flesh, and a representative behavior of both is even outlined for us as that chapter 5 draws to a close.
[time=2212] You open up chapter 6 and it says brethren, if any man is caught in any trespass, you say what's that word mean? That means to step off the path, you immediately know that this is defined as behavior that is not characteristic of the Spirit of God but characteristic of the flesh.
[time=2230] That is the scope of church discipline. That is the basis or the realm in which we are to interact with one another for the purpose of restoration.
[time=2242] And really it's a fantastic picture because it assumes that we are all walking together on this path of righteousness, this path of the Spirit of God.
[time=2252] And that at some point or another, a person chooses to step off that path. And before we all just run along our merry way, we stop and we care for the one who has stepped off, and we allow ourselves to be involved with them to the degree that they are eventually back on the path and then we move on.
[time=2272] The path of walking with Christ leaves room for individuality and diversity within the body of Christ. We are not a bunch of robots or automatons who mindlessly move in very prescribed ways of obedience down some narrow little path.
[time=2287] It is this road of the Spirit of God which leaves room for the diverse expression of individuality and yet it is still consistent with obedience to the Word of God.
[time=2297] We are free in Christ, we are led by Christ, we are walking by the Spirit of God, but there is another path, the path of sin, the path of the flesh.
[time=2308] And from time to time some will wander off this path. And we are to help them.
[time=2315] Now notice again in verse 1, "Brother and even if a man is caught in any trespass," the word caught simply means to overtake by surprise, to be taken off guard.
[time=2326] In other words, he hadn't corrected himself yet or she hadn't corrected herself yet and she or he hadn't planned on you understanding or even being aware of their sin, but you have become aware of it.
[time=2337] And you may have become aware of it by direct and immediate involvement, you may have become aware of it by virtue of hearing about it from someone else and as we progress in our study we will learn how to handle even that scenario.
[time=2350] But to one degree or another the person has stepped off the path and they are now caught out there.
[time=2356] They are overtaken in their sin, they are found out.
[time=2364] But the energy and the theme and the thrust of this passage and really of all of church discipline is in what we are called to do.
[time=2373] "Brother and if any man is caught in any trespass then you who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of gentleness."
[time=2380] This word "restore" may be one of the most beautiful words in all of the Scriptures.
[time=2385] It is a word that in the original Greek, classical Greek, Greek outside the Bible was used in the medical community in the orthopedic vein of restoring a broken bone.
[time=2398] It was used to describe what the doctor would do when a patient would come and the bone has been broken and it is no longer useful, it is under intense pain and the doctor would take and set the bone and heal the bone and restore the bone to a place of usefulness.
[time=2414] That is the theme of restoration, that is the theme of church discipline, that is the overarching emphasis.
[time=2419] When any Christian works with another Christian the purpose is to restore that person back to a place of obedience to abide by the word and the will of God so that they can again be useful.
[time=2432] Mark chapter 1 verse 19 uses this word "catartizo" which is the word "restore" and it has "John" and "James" in a boat.
[time=2441] It is the end of the day and they are there mending their nets. That is the word "mending" and here it is translated "mending" and here it is translated "restore".
[time=2449] What they are doing is after a long day of fishing the net has undergone some trauma and it would be often that the net would have been ripped and torn.
[time=2457] Well a net that is ripped or torn is of no value to a fisherman because the fish go out through the hole and so the fishermen sit at the end of every day and they carefully examine their nets and when there is a tear or a rip they mend that net and then they clean the net of any debris that would have been inadvertently gathered up in the net and then they fold the net nicely and neatly at the end of the day because they are making it ready for the next day's work.
[time=2484] There is nothing in the New Testament to describe or to support the notion that when someone has fallen into sin you involve yourself in their life to expose them, to embarrass them, to judge them, to meddle in their life, to control their life, to manipulate their life.
[time=2504] The Bible unquestionably calls you to be involved. That's not under debate. The word "restore" is an imperative verb, it's a command, it is not an option. When you become aware of someone else's sin you are accountable to God to be involved in their life. That's not a question.
[time=2522] What sometimes is misunderstood is that you are to be involved in their life for the purpose of mending their life as a net or setting the bone of their life so that they can again be useful to the king of kings and the lord of lords who has redeemed them in the first place and has a purpose for their life.
[time=2541] That is the theme, that is the thought, that is the emphasis, that is the main point. Whether you are talking about restoration in this passage or whether you are talking about restoration in Matthew 18 or whether we go back to 1 Timothy, that is the underlying reality of how God wants us to function in each other's lives when one of us has fallen into sin and that is to restore.
[time=2562] To bring that person back to a place of usefulness to Christ. So probably the number one question about church discipline is very clearly definitively answered by this passage. What are the sins that merit it?
[time=2577] Answer anything that is characteristic of the flesh, anything that is not of the spirit of God. Question number two about church discipline is what is the goal of church discipline?
[time=2588] The answer again definitively given restoration, usefulness, men the life, set the bone.
[time=2596] Question number three which is often times also misunderstood is who is to do this restoring? Who does the work of restoration and the answer again is in verse one? Brethren, if any man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness.
[time=2613] They are called spiritual, that is all that is said about them. You will notice that it does not say the pastor, it does not say elder, it does not say deacon, it does not say staff member, there are words for all of those in the Greek excepting staff members, it does not say deachanas or prezbuteras, none of those words are there just the spiritual words.
[time=2636] You say what does that mean? Well again we will allow the context to define that, a spiritual person is anybody who is walking by the spirit.
[time=2645] It is any one of you or any of us who are walking day after day as you are led by the spirit of God, that is your qualification, that is the only prerequisite to being involved in the process of restoration.
[time=2657] You don't need a title, you don't need a position in the church, you don't need a seminary degree, you don't need to have been ordained, you are just an average normal everyday believer who is walking in the spirit of God as a characteristic pattern.
[time=2671] And you are therefore defined by the Bible as a spiritual person and we could take the time, I don't think we need to support that in other places in Scripture.
[time=2680] The designation of being spiritual is not that you have been born again, it is that you are walking by the spirit of God, you who are spiritual restore.
[time=2690] So it doesn't say perfect people, it doesn't say if you have never sinned since you have come to Christ, okay you are the spiritual people you go restore.
[time=2698] It doesn't say if you have never sinned in that particular area, if you are flawless or blameless in that area then you go and restore.
[time=2707] It implies that we are all a bunch of struggling people and we all have faults and we all have sinned and we all struggle.
[time=2715] But we are for the most part walking on the path of obedience by the spirit of God.
[time=2721] And when one of our members or one of those who call themselves believers gets off of that path, we who are still on that path at that moment in time, though we may have been last month off the path and just gotten back on it.
[time=2734] But we are on this path, we have responsibility and accountability and privilege and opportunity to take a hold of them and be involved in the restorative process.
[time=2742] It is not for the spiritually elite, it is not for those who walk around with badges that say I am the restoring people of this church.
[time=2750] I am in the office of restoration, it doesn't exist, it is for the family of God, is what the family of God does when one of its members falls into sin.
[time=2761] So it is basic ordinary Christians.
[time=2766] Now notice the attitude of restoration, again in verse 1, restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness.
[time=2774] Each one looking to yourself, less you to be tempted.
[time=2779] This is a word that describes meekness, softness.
[time=2783] There is a very present awareness in the heart of the one doing the restoring or trying to be involved in the restoration that it could be me needing this restoration.
[time=2793] I could be the one who was tempted, I could be the one next month or next year that is in need of this kind of restoration.
[time=2800] There is no sense of superiority, there is no sense of judgmental attitude.
[time=2804] This is just one beggar if you will, telling another beggar where the bread is. I mean we are both in trouble often and I happen to be okay now and I am helping you back onto the path.
[time=2816] So it is an attitude of humility.
[time=2822] So the first thing the word of God tells us to do with a person who has fallen down is pick them up, restore them, bring them back on the path.
[time=2831] But I want you to notice in verse 2 that it is a whole lot more involved than simply going to a person having them confess their sin and they are saying they will repent and then you don't see them anymore.
[time=2847] Look at verse 2, bear one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ. The walking metaphor carries on here. The notion of bearing another's burdens is that you see a person on the path.
[time=2859] But the consequences of their sin are still so heavy, the relationships are so damaged that just the general weakness of their spiritual condition makes their life so heavy and so they are on this path but they are overburdened by their load and they can't make any progress.
[time=2876] So you come along and you take part of their burden, you shoulder some of their load and you walk with them.
[time=2885] Probably the greatest example I have ever seen of this happened some years ago. At the Master's College there were a team of five or six of us who were giving spiritual leadership of the college, we were a part of the president's council and one of the members of that council committed adultery.
[time=2901] He had an adulterous affair. He stepped off the path. He took a big huge step off the path of walking in the spirit of God.
[time=2911] And of course as is always the case it was a series of little steps until he eventually ended up way over there.
[time=2918] And when that became, came to our awareness some of the men on that team went to the individual who had committed adultery and confronted him with his sin.
[time=2929] He admitted his sin. He confessed it. He vowed himself to return to his wife. He was appropriately removed from spiritual leadership having then been disqualified by the adultery.
[time=2944] A new man was hired into the position he had once held and we had somewhat the notion that the restoration process was complete.
[time=2955] Things were back to normal. So in one sense that maybe it may have been true. He had been confronted. He had confessed. He had repented. He had broken the affair. He had vowed himself back to his wife. He had been removed from leadership. Replacement had been hired.
[time=2970] But let me suggest to you that the restoration process was far from being complete. Far from being complete.
[time=2980] A man who had committed the adultery couldn't even be in the same room with his wife. She was so livid and so angry and so hurt by what had gone on.
[time=2992] They couldn't sleep in the same house. They couldn't talk face to face.
[time=2998] People of hurt and the level of pain, the damage was so heavy. The burden, if you will, for this man who had done wrong but had repented and vowed to do the right things.
[time=3008] But the burden was so heavy that he, in a sense, was just overwhelmed by it on the path of the Spirit of God.
[time=3017] And then entered George and Jerry. George and Jerry. George had no title in our church. He had never held any big office.
[time=3027] He had had no special commissioning to minister to this couple who were in such trouble. They just had known them in the past, had become aware of the situation, and knew that their marriage was in a shambles.
[time=3042] And in the ensuing six to eight months, they gave themselves wholeheartedly to this couple. They were absolutely exhausted.
[time=3051] The ministry that they gave to this family required that they significantly alter and even cancel their normal weekly routines of life.
[time=3060] They canceled their vacations at points because going out of town would have left them in two vulnerable situations. Nights after night, after night, they lost countless hours of sleep because they had invited her, the wife, the man who had committed the adultery, they invited her to come into their home and to live with them because they couldn't live together.
[time=3081] And they would, on endless accounts, listen to her venting of unbelievable anger as she had felt so completely violated by her husband.
[time=3093] She had an interesting habit about her. She really loved her animals and felt it would have been impossible for her to live at this time in her life without her animals.
[time=3103] And so they allowed her to bring her dogs and her cats, both plural, into their new home, which had just been redecorated.
[time=3115] And her dogs and her cats were not outside dogs and cats. They were inside dogs and cats. They would sleep in the room with her and they would run all over the carpet and run all over the furniture.
[time=3128] They also had their own children and then she had a daughter and you can imagine the kind of turmoil that that threw their home into.
[time=3136] I'm talking about an absolute total commitment of one family to another family to see that family restored, to bear one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ.
[time=3147] Whatever it took, George and Jerry were willing to do to see that family put back together for usefulness for the cause of Christ.
[time=3156] It's life for life. Often that's what it takes. It's life for life. It's not just going and confronting and seeking repentance and gaining repentance and new vows to obedience and getting the whole thing on the surface back together and then you walk away.
[time=3173] It is a deep life commitment and involvement to those that have come across your path as they have fallen from obedience and you go the distance to bear one another's burdens.
[time=3185] I can't think of any greater apologetic for the reality of Christ than that kind of love, that kind of commitment, that kind of involvement.
[time=3202] I'm saying that when you're involved in the restoration process, when we as a church grab a hold of concepts such as these, you will find that you are drawn into other people's lives and a level that cost you your own.
[time=3220] And long after the hub of excitement had blown over at the college about an affair and the buzz of energy had died down and when everybody else at school and the church had gone back to the normal routine of their life,
[time=3231] the church and Jerry were still hard at work because they understood the teaching of the word of God about restoration and they were willing to give to the point that it happened.
[time=3243] I can think of no greater ministry. I can think of no stronger evidence of the love of Christ, no more powerful investment or significant investment in the kingdom of God than when one Christian is willing to give whatever it takes to see another Christian put back on the path of obedience.
[time=3260] In chapter 6, verses 3 and 4, as the passage continues to develop, it says this, "For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself, but let each one examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another, for each one shall bear his own load."
[time=3283] You're thinking, wait a minute now, in verse 2 it tells me to bear my brothers' load and in verse 5 it tells me I've got to bear my own load. Well those are two different words.
[time=3292] The word in verse 2 for bear is the idea of a heavy, excessive, too big of a burden for me to bear.
[time=3298] The bear in verse 5 is a very reasonable load that was used in classical Greek to describe a soldier's backpack in time of war very well within his ability to bear his own load, but the point here is back to the attitude in verses 3 and 4.
[time=3313] There was an attitude of superiority at this church. There was an attitude of legalism and they were beginning to move away from the grace of God.
[time=3320] They were moving away from salvation by grace through faith and they were beginning to add back some of the legalistic external tendencies of their former Judaism past.
[time=3332] And he is saying to these people, look it, I don't want to hear about your legalistic external observances of man-made codes.
[time=3340] If you like to evaluate your spirituality, verse 3, if you think anyone thinks he is something, if you think you're anything in the cause of Christ,
[time=3348] but you're not involved in bearing one another's burdens, you're not involved in restoring people who have fallen into sin.
[time=3354] You're nothing, you deceive yourself, examine your work, and after you've examined your work, obviously in the context, your work of restoring people, not standing aloof from them in their problems as you maintain some separated legalistic code, you'll have reason for boasting.
[time=3374] [MUSIC]
[time=3379] So it's...
[time=3404] If as a result of today's program, you have decided to accept Jesus Christ into your heart as your personal Lord and Savior, I'd like to invite you to bow your head even right now and pray with me.
[time=3417] Father, I recognize that I am a sinful human being who has violated the law of God, but I'm thankful for the person of Jesus Christ who has died in the cross for my sins and lives that I might have life, that I might have forgiveness.
[time=3431] I accept Him as my Savior, I give Him control of my life, and I ask God that you would help me from this day forward to walk in a minute as pleasing to you.
[time=3442] And your name Jesus, amen.
