[time=313] [MUSIC - 49 seconds]
[time=373] - Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=381] - Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today, and we especially thank those of you that have written in in the last couple weeks, letting us know that you watched the Bible Hour.
[time=390] We're really grateful for that.
[time=391] We said in the studio here, and I'm really not sure who's watching and what the response is.
[time=397] So when you write to us, that gives us a good indication of the gift offers and the message that we have on the Bible Hour is meeting your needs.
[time=405] I want to tell you about some exciting events that continue to take place here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church this summer.
[time=412] And we're going to have Lanna Young ran a hand coming.
[time=415] Lanna is a young lady who sings for the glory of God.
[time=419] If you like Sandy Paddy style, Lanna is very close to Sandy Paddy.
[time=424] Sings beautifully, has a radiant testimony for the Lord, and she's going to be here on Wednesday evening, July 22nd at 7pm.
[time=433] That program is at the Black Hawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne at 7400 East State.
[time=439] Lanna Young ran a hand will be here at 7pm on July 22nd.
[time=444] I believe Lanna began singing at Black Hawk when she was about 13 years old.
[time=448] She lives in Michigan and we've had her a number of times, and our people always enjoy the ministry of Lanna.
[time=454] So come and join with us on July 22nd.
[time=458] And then another delightful musical team will be with us on August 16th.
[time=462] We want you to plan ahead.
[time=463] That's a Sunday evening.
[time=465] They'll be here at 6pm.
[time=467] They're entitled The Kings Brass.
[time=469] Tim Zimmerman is a professor at Grace College, and he organizes a number of young men and women who teach and colleges throughout the year and then travel into summer as the Kings Brass.
[time=481] Some of the best brass you'll ever hear will be with us on Sunday evening, August 16th at 6pm.
[time=489] I love brass music and I love this group and I hope you'll make a special attempt to be with us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 6pm, August 16th.
[time=500] Now just outside the studio, they're building some new buildings.
[time=505] We have 10 classrooms and a gymnasium going up, and we've had great progress in the last couple weeks.
[time=511] And I've asked Steve Longbreak and our pastor teacher, Russell Moore, to join us next week with some footage of the construction progress, and they'll just explain to you what's taking place.
[time=522] So I hope you'll stay tuned next week for that, exciting information concerning the progress of our building program.
[time=531] The last couple of months we've been offering the Bible character cards, and so many of you responded.
[time=536] And I hope you'll even take some time to let us know how effective they were as you met with your children and grandchildren and teaching them characters from the Bible through those Bible character cards.
[time=548] Let us know about them and we certainly had a number of people that wrote in form.
[time=554] Our gift offer this month is called "How to Grow a Happy Family." It's a booklet, it's not filled with gadgets at all.
[time=560] It's just systematic effort and trying to get your family to just be a little more coordinated, a little bit more of a flavor of a real family attitude together, cooperating with one another, and this summer would be a great time to do that.
[time=575] So I'd like to have you write for this book "How to Grow a Happy Family." You can write to it by writing to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=590] Once again, the title is "How to Grow a Happy Family." And you can receive it by writing to the Bible hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=606] I was just looking at one of the chapters, it's called "Hickory Dickory Doc, How to Beat the Clock." I was astounded at how much time we take to get prepared for work,
[time=617] how much time it takes us to go to work, to and from, and the hours that we spend at work.
[time=622] Also was amazed at one of the statistics that said that we spend an average of one minute a day with our children.
[time=630] That's not very much.
[time=631] And I hope that as you receive this booklet, that your time frame will change just a little bit.
[time=637] The next chapter is "How to Have a Happy Wallet." That ought to be an interesting chapter for you, and I hope that you'll write for this book this week.
[time=646] We encourage you, as you write for this gift offer, that if you'll send us a donation, we'd appreciate that very much, as that will help in the expense of providing this program on a week-to-week basis.
[time=658] We're gonna go back to the live portion of our service now.
[time=661] We have a special guest speaker, Reverend Ron Scarf.
[time=664] Ron is a member of our church, and speaks often at Black Hawk, and we thank you for his ministry.
[time=669] And I'm sure that if you stay tuned today, you will receive a blessing from his message.
[time=673] We go back now to the live portion of our program.
[time=676] God bless you, as you stay tuned with us.
[time=682] (upbeat music)
[time=711] [MUSIC - 78 seconds]
[time=796] (audience applause) - The scripture that our message will come from today
[time=813] is Joshua 23 verses one through nine and 14.
[time=817] In verse 14, I'll read those at this time.
[time=820] After a long time had passed, and the Lord had given Israel rest from all their enemies around them, Joshua by then, old and well advanced in years, summoned all Israel, their elders, leaders, judges, and officials, and said to them, I am old and well advanced in years.
[time=838] You yourself have seen everything the Lord your God has done to all these nations for your sake.
[time=843] It was the Lord your God who fought for you.
[time=846] Remember how I have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes, all the land of the nations that remain, the nations I conquered, between the Jordan and the Great Sea and the West.
[time=857] The Lord your God himself will drive them out of your way.
[time=860] He will push them out before you, and you will take possession of their land as the Lord your God promised you.
[time=866] Be very strong, be careful to obey all that is written in the book of the law of Moses without turning aside to the right or to the left.
[time=874] Do not associate with these nations that remain among you.
[time=877] Do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them.
[time=881] You must not serve them or bow down to them, but you are to hold fast to the Lord your God as you have until now.
[time=888] The Lord has driven out before you great and powerful nations.
[time=892] To this day, no one has been able to withstand you.
[time=896] And then verse 14, "Now I am about to go the way of all the earth.
[time=900] You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed.
[time=907] Every promise has been fulfilled.
[time=909] Not one has failed." My favorite preacher is the person that God has placed me under
[time=927] as my pastor teacher.
[time=929] I decided that a lot of years ago.
[time=931] The one time David Jeremiah was my favorite preacher.
[time=933] Then Rick was my favorite preacher.
[time=936] Now Russell is my favorite preacher.
[time=938] I believe they have for me what God wants me to hear as a man in my family.
[time=944] They are able to deliver the message that God wants me to hear.
[time=948] And so they are my favorite.
[time=950] But I get to choose number two.
[time=953] And of all the people in the world that I get a chance to hear, Ron Scarf is one of those people that I just love to hear preach.
[time=962] And one of the reasons that I enjoy him so much is that I have had opportunity to observe what he's done in his family.
[time=971] Roslyn and Jocelyn are wonderful young women.
[time=975] And Ron and the Vangeline have given themselves to serving the Lord and making their priorities right so that they have these two fine young ladies as evidence of the fact that they've been walking with God.
[time=987] And I can't wait to hear him preach again this morning to have him come right from our own church and fill our pulpit.
[time=992] Let's welcome Ron Scarf.
[time=995] (audience applauding) - Thank you Steve for those kind but I'm sure undeserved words.
[time=1009] And I would like to say that it indeed is a joy for me to be able to occupy this pulpit again.
[time=1015] And I've had the privilege to do this on several occasions.
[time=1018] And it's always a privilege.
[time=1020] I kind of privilege to be able to participate in the services and to be able to share from the scriptures.
[time=1027] And if you have your bibles with you this morning and if you have them open to the passage that was just read for us from Joshua chapter 23, I want to direct your attention to this chapter.
[time=1037] I want to direct your attention to begin with to a particular verse, it's verse 14, where Joshua says to the elders of the nation of Israel on this particular occasion, he says, "Not one word of all that the Lord has spoken unto you has failed or come to pass." And this morning I want to speak to you on the subject of the faithfulness of God.
[time=1061] And I want to use this text, verse 14, but I want to study it in the context of this chapter.
[time=1066] And I also want to study it in the context of the overall book of Joshua.
[time=1072] Some time ago on national TV, there was a program dealing with a crisis and ethical crisis here in America, dealing with the loss of integrity and the stiving effects that this is having on the moral foundation of our nation.
[time=1089] And this particular program began by zering in on the political world and showed not in the case of every politician, but in the case of some politicians at least that there is a dichotomy between on the one hand their rhetoric and their speeches and on the other hand their lifestyle.
[time=1106] And then the program drew the attention of the viewer to the business world and showed that many businessmen today have a great amount of pressure placed upon them incentives to achieve immediate success.
[time=1119] And as a result, there were many times take shortcuts to close a deal.
[time=1124] And then the program moved on to marriage and the family and pointed out how many of our young people today are taking vows pertaining to marriage.
[time=1133] And they're saying, I do, I do verbally, but as they verbalize those words that in the back of their mind, they're saying maybe if perhaps, and they're qualifying their commitment to their partner.
[time=1146] And as a result, there's a tremendous increase in the divorce rate.
[time=1151] And then the program went on to look at our schools and our colleges and showed how in the case of so many students today that the accepted practice is cheating in homework and in term papers, term projects, and examinations.
[time=1166] And showed how our educational system is being so drastically affected by this kind of ethical practice.
[time=1173] And finally, the concluding part of the program drew the attention of the viewer to the pain of income tax come April each year and showed how much fraud there is in America today because of inaccurate reporting and falsifying one's reports pertaining to his or her income tax.
[time=1193] And the result is that the moral foundation of our nation is being slowly destroyed.
[time=1200] And there's widespread skepticism in America today.
[time=1203] There's a loss of confidence, a loss of trust in one another in many of our esteemed organizations and institutions.
[time=1212] And that's a tragic situation, is it not?
[time=1214] I'm sure you would agree with me, but how refreshing it is to turn from that drastic situation to the scriptures and find, for instance, a number is chapter 23 verse 19 that it says that God is not a man that he should lie.
[time=1230] And in Hebrews chapter 6 verse 18, it says, it is impossible for God to lie.
[time=1236] And Moses reminds the children of Israel and Deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 9.
[time=1241] He says, I want you to know this as a certain fact as a certain truth that the Lord, your God, is the faithful God.
[time=1250] Now God's faithfulness is based on his integrity because he is a God of integrity.
[time=1254] He is trustworthy and he is reliable.
[time=1258] And that is seen in his faithfulness, his faithfulness to his word and his faithfulness to his people.
[time=1266] Here we have before us this morning in Joshua chapter 23, the farewell address of Joshua.
[time=1273] And I don't know how it is with you, but I know that I find the last words of esteemed renowned leaders to be very challenging and provocative.
[time=1283] I think, for instance, of Douglas MacArthur at the end of his brilliant military career as he delivered his farewell address to our Congress.
[time=1292] He referred to himself as you may recall as that old soldier who tried to do his duty as God gave him
[time=1300] light and then he concluded with those touching words and he said to the Congress, goodbye.
[time=1306] And it seems as though he faded off then into the limelight.
[time=1311] You know, when you look at the life of Moses and the life of Joshua, there are certain parallels.
[time=1317] You'll find, for instance, that both of these men, Moses and Joshua, that they had the privilege of leading the nation of Israel through a body of water.
[time=1326] Moses led the Israelites across the red sea, as you will recall, Joshua led the Israelites across the Jordan River.
[time=1334] Both of these men had an exposure to a theophany from God, a dramatic experience when God in a dynamic way revealed himself to them and said to both of them on different occasions, of course, said to them, remove your shoes from off your feet for the ground in which you stand as holy ground.
[time=1353] Both of them had the privilege of building altars by which to worship God.
[time=1358] Both of them also wrote words which later were written in a book.
[time=1363] And both of them concluded their careers by delivering farewell addresses.
[time=1368] Moses delivered his farewell address in Deuteronomy chapter 32 and Joshua here in Joshua chapter 23.
[time=1375] Josephus, the great Jewish historian, tells us that Joshua spent 40 years in Egypt and 40 years then in the wilderness and it took him seven years during the time of the conquest so that at the end of Joshua chapter 22, Joshua was approximately 87 years of age.
[time=1394] We know from the last chapter in Joshua chapter 24 verse 29 that Joshua now is 110 years of age.
[time=1401] That means there's approximately 23 years that has a lapse between Joshua chapter 22 and Joshua chapter 23.
[time=1409] And Joshua and all probability delivered this farewell address to the leaders of Israel at Shiloh.
[time=1418] The text doesn't tell us this but Shiloh is where the tabernacle was located in an all probability that would be the most suitable location for the delivering of this personal and this powerful address on the part of Joshua at the end of his brilliant military career.
[time=1435] Now there are four words or four concepts that I believe summarize the basic themes that weave their way through this address.
[time=1444] We have first of all the review and then secondly the responsibility.
[time=1448] Thirdly, we have the recognition and finally we have the reminder and I want you to notice to begin with if you turn in this 23rd chapter and looking at verse three that Joshua says to these elders, these officers of this nation.
[time=1464] He says, "You have seen all that the Lord your God has done for you." And I want you to notice, he says, "You have seen." He doesn't say, "You have heard." And he doesn't say, "You have read." But he says, "You have seen." You've been participants.
[time=1478] You've been eyewitnesses.
[time=1480] You've been involved in all of the events in recent history.
[time=1485] Recently, I heard a soldier interviewed on TV who was involved in the Normandy invasion in June of 1944 in D-Day, in liberating Europe.
[time=1497] And he says, "We were so intensely involved in the Normandy invasion that it wasn't until later afterwards as we looked back that we realized that at the time we were making history." But he says, "At the time, we didn't realize we were making history." And you see, that's basically what Joshua's seeking to inculcate in the minds of these elders of Israel at this point.
[time=1520] He wants them to realize that they have been involved in making history.
[time=1525] And obviously, when he says, "You have seen," this takes the leaders as well as taking us back to the very first chapter in the book of Joshua.
[time=1533] And you may recall in this book, opens that there are two announcements that are made.
[time=1536] The first announcement that's made is that Moses, the servant of the Lord, is dead.
[time=1541] Moses, the leader, the then leader of Israel.
[time=1544] The second announcement that is made is, now that Moses is dead, the Lord says, "Joshua, you are now my newly appointed leader and replacement for Moses." And as soon as that announcement is made, then the Lord gives a three-fold challenge to Joshua.
[time=1562] And he says, "Joshua, I want you to be strong.
[time=1565] I want you to be steadfast, and I want you to be studious.
[time=1568] I want you to be strong to accept the position of leadership.
[time=1572] I want you to be steadfast in attacking the problems pertaining to leadership, the internal problems, dealing with the nation of Israel, the problems of apathy and complacency, and the problems that you're going to be faced within dealing with the Canaanites." And then 30 said, "I want you to be studious." And you all won't remember those words in Joshua chapter 1, verse 8.
[time=1593] "When the Lord said to Joshua, "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it, for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success." Obviously, the success and the prosperity that is promised to Joshua is not materialistic in nature, but it is success in terms of carrying out his threefold charge and his threefold commission.
[time=1621] And that threefold charge was that Joshua was first of all to lead Israel across the Jordan.
[time=1627] And then secondly, Joshua in the Israelites were to conquer the enemy.
[time=1632] And there were three campangers, you may recall.
[time=1634] There was a central campaign, then there was a southern campaign, and then there was a northern campaign.
[time=1638] And then thirdly, they were to divide the land, and then they were to settle in the land.
[time=1643] And those were the three basic charges given to Joshua.
[time=1648] And no doubt Joshua, at this particular point, with the children of Israel, as they are located at a little town, seven miles east of the Jordan, it's a town called Sitem.
[time=1659] No doubt Joshua realizes that he is faced with a formidable task.
[time=1666] Can you just think of the logistics that would be involved on his part in mobilizing a nation, organizing a nation to take them across the Jordan, and then to conquer all of the Canaanites, and then to settle the land.
[time=1680] And you see, as they are located at Sitem, it's one thing for them, seven miles distance from the Jordan, and looking beyond the Jordan to the Promised Land, it's one thing to contemplate the land.
[time=1692] It's another thing to conquer the land.
[time=1695] It's one thing for them to observe the land, but it's another thing for them to occupy the land.
[time=1700] And it's one thing for them from a distance to see the land, but it's another thing for them to secure the land.
[time=1707] You see, this is what's entailed in what we call the problem of translation.
[time=1712] It's a problem I face.
[time=1713] It's a problem you face when we read scripture, when we study scripture, we're absorbing scripture, but do we apply scripture, do we appropriate scripture, so that what we are studying, the truth of God becomes incarnate in my life, and incarnate in your life, that God's truth becomes manifest in our lifestyle.
[time=1732] It's one thing to have the task assigned, it's another thing to have the task achieved, and that's the whole book of Joshua.
[time=1741] It's the book that deals from the assignment of the task to the achievement of the task.
[time=1746] And now here in verse three, Joshua is saying to these elders, after the conquest is over, and after they're looking back, he is saying, this is the time for review, this is the time for reflection.
[time=1757] He says, do you realize what you've been participating in?
[time=1761] How do you count for all of the successes?
[time=1763] How do you count for all of the victories that we have experienced as a nation?
[time=1770] That's the question.
[time=1771] And the answer that he gives here in verse three, he says, I want you to realize it's because the Lord has been with you.
[time=1778] The Lord has been with us.
[time=1780] He is the one who has intervened in our lives.
[time=1783] It is his presence, his providence.
[time=1785] It is his power, it is his protection.
[time=1787] He is the one who has been fighting against our enemies.
[time=1793] And this is the reason why now we are in this promised land.
[time=1798] What Joshua is basically saying to these elders is the history that we have been participating in is no common ordinary history.
[time=1808] It's not history that you can explain on the basis of the principle of naturalism.
[time=1814] You can't explain this history on the basis of the scientific principle of cause and effect.
[time=1820] It's because of the involvement of God in our nation and God leading and guiding and fighting on our behalf.
[time=1828] In other words, Joshua is seeking to open their eyes to realize the significance and the meaningfulness of these historic events that have been occurring within the recent past.
[time=1842] You may have heard the story told about the man from Colorado who was used to the mountains and he moved to Texas and he built a house in Texas.
[time=1854] And I had a large picture window and he looked out his picture window and he says there's nothing here in Texas to see.
[time=1862] All I see are acres and acres and acres of range land.
[time=1867] Nothing to see here in Texas.
[time=1869] The same time a man from Texas moved to Colorado and he built his house overlooking the mountains and had a large picture window.
[time=1876] He says here in Colorado there's nothing to see.
[time=1879] He says the mountains are always getting in my view.
[time=1882] It's just a reminder to us this morning that as humans our minds are conditioned and trained and predisposed to see what we want to see and to filter out what we don't want to see.
[time=1897] Anything that does not fit in with our own preconceived ideas in our presuppositions.
[time=1902] And here we have an eye opener, verse three.
[time=1905] Here we have the review to these elders.
[time=1908] Josh was saying the Lord has been with you.
[time=1912] The Lord has been with us.
[time=1914] It is the Lord who has been fighting for us and this is why today we stand in this land of our inheritance.
[time=1922] And that's secondly, I want you to notice that we have in this farewell address what I'd like to call responsibility in verse 11.
[time=1931] I want you to notice that Joshua says to these same leaders.
[time=1934] He says I want you to take diligent heed to love the Lord your God.
[time=1942] Now God has already given them rest.
[time=1945] You see that in verse two.
[time=1947] The conquest basically is over and the military presence of Israel has been established in the land.
[time=1955] And yet there is work yet to be done.
[time=1958] There are pockets of resistance and there are mopping up exercises that still have to be taken care of.
[time=1964] But we all know from experience and this is the problem that Josh was faced within dealing with these elders that after the initial glow of victory, many times, it's easy for us to settle down and to slack off to lose our enthusiasm, to lose our intensity.
[time=1983] It's very difficult for us to maintain and to retain our original vigor and vision.
[time=1992] And you see this whole farewell address is dealing with the theme of passing on the torch to the next generation.
[time=1999] And Josh was saying to these elders that if they're gonna be effective in passing on the torch, passing on the faith that they themselves have to set the example by loving the Lord their God and being diligent in this matter of their allegiance and their commitment.
[time=2017] We're told by many sports analysts that the greatest race that was run in the 20th century here in America took place in 1973 at the Kentucky Derby.
[time=2029] When Secretariat ran and won the Kentucky Derby that year and broke the two-minute barrier setting a record in one minute, 59 and two-fifths of a second, a record I think that still stands but that's not the only outstanding characteristic of that race.
[time=2045] Every quarter that Secretariat ran in that race.
[time=2048] He ran faster than the previous quarter so that at the end of the race he was running faster than at the beginning of the race.
[time=2056] Well, there's a lesson there that applies to me and a lesson that applies to you that so often in terms of our commitment to the Lord and his kingdom that we begin with a great deal of enthusiasm and zest.
[time=2070] But after a few victories and a few successes that's very easy for us to become apathetic and complacent and subtle down and slacking off, and this is the concern here that Joshua has in sharing with these elders.
[time=2084] You may remember that the Lord Jesus said to the church at Ephesus in Revelation chapter 2 verse 4.
[time=2092] He said, "I have this against you that you have left, that you have lost your first love." And I wonder how many of us today have lost the freshness and the vitality of that first love that we experienced in our encounter with the Lord.
[time=2112] You see, without love, we may have the shell, but we won't have the spirit.
[time=2119] We may have the programs, but we're not going to have the power.
[time=2123] We may have all of the mechanics, but we're not going to have the might.
[time=2127] That's why love is the ground rule, the ground principle.
[time=2133] Now, in order for this to make sense to these elders,
[time=2139] Joshua tells them in verse 6, that if they truly love the Lord with diligence, the evidence will be their personal obedience to the word of God, to the law of God.
[time=2152] You know, man has been so created that he will always bow to some form of authority.
[time=2160] That's characteristic of man.
[time=2161] That's the nature and the essence of man.
[time=2164] And of man does not bow to the authority of God's revelation in his word.
[time=2170] Then man is going to seek some other substitute.
[time=2172] He will either bow to some kind of individualistic subjectivism or mysticism or humanistic traditionalism or autonomous rationalism.
[time=2182] But there's only one kind of authority when we submit to it that brings internal, perpetual satisfaction and fulfillment.
[time=2191] And that's when we submit to the authority of the word of God and the will of God.
[time=2196] And it's through obedience at this point that we prove our love for the Lord.
[time=2204] When there's love apart from obedience, that kind of love is mere chatter, it's empty talk.
[time=2212] That's why Jesus said in John chapter 14 and verse 15, he said, "If you love me, keep my commandments." The evidence of your love is obedience.
[time=2222] You're all familiar with that well known model of Delta Airlines.
[time=2227] You see it almost every week on your TV screen.
[time=2230] They say, "We love flying and it shows." We love flying and it shows the quality of the service that we provide.
[time=2239] If we love the Lord, it's going to reveal itself, manifest itself in the quality and the durability of our obedience to the Lord.
[time=2249] Our obedience to His Word.
[time=2250] Now, Joshua still is not finished in terms of this responsibility.
[time=2254] I want you to notice the structure of his discussion at this point.
[time=2258] He begins by telling these elders that they are to be diligent and loving the Lord their God.
[time=2262] And if they love the Lord their God, they're going to be obedient.
[time=2266] But now, he shows them three areas, three practical areas where they are to test themselves in terms of their obedience.
[time=2275] I want you to notice the beginning with in verse 7.
[time=2278] The Joshua says that if they are obedient to the Lord their God, that on the part of these elders, on the part of the nation, that there's going to be no identification with pagan culture.
[time=2291] Because Joshua knows that as soon as you've got identification, identification leads to accommodation.
[time=2297] And when you've got accommodation, a accommodation leads to assimilation.
[time=2302] Not too long ago Charles Colson was asked the question concerning the evangelical church in the day and age in which we live, as to whether or not culture has more to fear from the church or does the church have more to fear from culture?
[time=2318] Now, if you know anything about church history, you know that when the church has been the church and when it has been committed to its mission and its message, the message of redemption, the powerful message of redemption through Christ, that culture has feared the impact of the church.
[time=2334] We think, for instance, in the acts of the apostles, the early history of the church.
[time=2338] Remember when the apostles went forth proclaiming the message of redemption that they'd turn the world upside down.
[time=2347] But Charles Colson said that tragic situation in America today in the church is that it's not culture that has to fear the church, unfortunately.
[time=2358] It's the church that has to fear culture, the relativism, the secularism, the materialism of the world, a worldly culture has infiltrated the church and is robbing the church of its life, of its vitality, of its strength and of its vision.
[time=2378] Not too long ago a book came off, the press authored by Russell Chandler entitled "Racing Toward the Year 2001." And that's what we're doing.
[time=2389] We're racing towards that year, are we not?
[time=2393] It's only about seven, eight years away.
[time=2396] And in this book, Chandler points out that in this last decade of the 20th century, that evangelical conservative Christians are going to increase in number.
[time=2406] They're going to increase in quantity.
[time=2409] But he says, unfortunately, they're not going to increase in commitment.
[time=2414] That the tragic situation is that the faith of so many evangelicals in the 1990s is that they're going to use their privatized faith to sanction their own personal pursuit, a prosperity, a position, and a prestige in this world.
[time=2433] And today in the church, we need to hear this message of Joshua when he says, "If we love the Lord our God, and we are obedient to the Lord our God, there's going to be no identification with pagan culture." Secondly, in verse 7, I want you to notice, he also says, that there's to be no idolatry with the pagan gods.
[time=2454] Notice he says here in verse 7, "To these elders, I don't want you even to name them.
[time=2460] I don't want you to swear by them.
[time=2463] I don't want you to bow down to them." Now, we all know something about these ancient gods and deities and idols of the Canaanites, about bail and the bales, and of asteroth and the asteroth.
[time=2477] And there's one thing for us to know something about ancient religion and all of these idols and deities.
[time=2483] But it's another thing for us today in America to be prepared to identify the gods and the idols and the deities in contemporary American culture.
[time=2495] And you know this as well as I, that America is progressively becoming a decrystionized nation.
[time=2503] Progressively becoming a pagan nation.
[time=2507] I think of what some of those idols are.
[time=2509] Some of those gods.
[time=2509] We have the cult of self-love today.
[time=2513] That is enamored so many.
[time=2516] We have the revival of the ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite, the goddess of erotic love, who has cast her spell upon the minds
[time=2527] and hearts of so many, the philosophy of sexism that has permeated American society.
[time=2533] Today we have the god of the success syndrome.
[time=2537] Today we have the god of sensationalistic entertainment, millions and millions and millions of dollars.
[time=2544] Every year being poured into entertainment that leaves men and women and young people hollow and empty.
[time=2551] And yet so many people bow down to that idol.
[time=2555] We have the goddess scientism, not science.
[time=2559] There's nothing wrong with science, but scientism, the philosophy that says that the only valid epistemological method of acquiring authentic knowledge is through the empirical application of the scientific method.
[time=2572] And that being so, that rules out receiving knowledge from God by way of revelation.
[time=2577] And there are so many today who are bowing down to the god of the philosophy of scientism.
[time=2584] Joshua says here to these elders, there's to be no identification with pagan culture.
[time=2591] There is to be no idolatry with the pagan gods.
[time=2596] And then thirdly, I want you to notice in verse 12, he says, and there's to be no intermarriage with pagan believers.
[time=2606] Now this is not a matter of racism.
[time=2608] This is a matter of faith.
[time=2610] If the faith is to be transmitted from one generation to another generation, Joshua is saying that those who are of the faith are to marry those who are of the faith, but those who are committed to Yahweh, the Lord your God, are not to be involved in marrying those who are committed to bail.
[time=2628] And there's nothing that destroys the transmission of the faith from one generation to another generation when God's people violate this basic principle.
[time=2639] And they find themselves involved in intermarrying with those who are not of the faith.
[time=2645] There's to be no identification.
[time=2647] There's to be no idolatry.
[time=2649] And there is to be no intermarriage.
[time=2653] Those are the three test cases where we prove our love
[time=2659] and where we prove our obedience to the Lord our God.
[time=2664] And then thirdly in this speech, in verse 14, after sharing the review and after sharing the responsibility, I want you to notice that Joshua comes to what I call the recognition.
[time=2675] And here he wants these elders to recognize that not one word of all of the good words that the Lord has shared with them has failed to come to pass.
[time=2688] This is perhaps the classic text dealing with the faithfulness of God in the Old Testament.
[time=2695] Not one word of all of the good words that God has given to you as a nation has failed to come to pass.
[time=2704] Notice here in verses 14 to 16 that the word good occurs four times.
[time=2710] In verses 14 and 15 we have the good word, the good word twice.
[time=2714] Then in verses 15 and 16 we have the good land, the good land twice.
[time=2718] God promised in his good word the good land to his people.
[time=2724] The promised land, the land of their inheritance.
[time=2726] And obviously when Joshua is sharing this truth, this principle with these elders, he's taking them back to their historic roots in the book of Genesis.
[time=2736] When God promised to Abraham that he would give to Abraham in his descendants their own land, the promised land, the land of their inheritance, which is the land of Kenan.
[time=2746] And God gave that promise to Abraham.
[time=2749] Then he repeated it and gave it to Isaac.
[time=2751] He gave it then to Jacob.
[time=2753] And then later he gave it to Moses.
[time=2756] Year after year, generation after generation, God kept promising his people that there's a land out there it's your land, it's my gift to you, it's your inheritance.
[time=2765] One day you will be in it, one day you will occupy it, one day you will enjoy it.
[time=2773] Now one of the great texts in the book of Joshua is found in chapter 5 verse 9.
[time=2780] After Joshua has led the children of Israel across the Jordan in chapter 3 and in chapter 4.
[time=2785] In chapter 5 verse 9 the Lord says to Joshua, "Jasua today, I have removed the reproach of the Egyptians from you." Now what did the Lord mean by that?
[time=2797] Well when Israel was in captivity in Egypt and when the Israelites were sharing their faith and talking about the promised land that one day they would inhabit and that would be given to them.
[time=2815] The Egyptians were mocking them, ridiculing them, scoffing at them, taunting them
[time=2822] and they were saying that's nothing but pie in the sky theology.
[time=2827] You're dreaming man, you're dreaming man.
[time=2831] There's nothing out there for you.
[time=2833] But now in Joshua chapter 5 verse 9 the Lord says to Joshua, "Today I have removed the reproach of the Egyptian from you." And it was on that day as you know that the manor for the first time in 40 years ceased
[time=2848] and Israel began to enjoy the produce of the land.
[time=2853] God is faithful.
[time=2855] God was faithful to Joshua.
[time=2859] He was faithful to these elders.
[time=2860] He was faithful to the nation of Israel.
[time=2863] He's faithful to you.
[time=2865] He's faithful to his word.
[time=2867] He's faithful to his promises.
[time=2869] What this as I say is the classic text dealing with the faithfulness of God in the Old Testament.
[time=2876] Let me if I may take you to the New Testament and briefly share with you the eight major
[time=2882] texts dealing with the faithfulness of God.
[time=2886] In 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 9, Paul says to the Corinthians, "God is faithful by
[time=2894] whom you were called into fellowship with His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2900] God is faithful to maintain you in that fellowship with Christ, blameless unto the end."
[time=2908] And then in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13, Paul says to the same grip of people of the Corinthians.
[time=2914] He says, "There has no temptation taken you, but such as his common to man.
[time=2920] God is faithful and he will not allow any temptation to overtake you that you cannot bear, but will with the temptation provide a way of escape that you may be able to bear at God is faithful
[time=2933] in our times of testings and in our times of trials to provide a way of escape."
[time=2940] The third text is found in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 verse 24, where Paul says, "Faithful
[time=2946] is He who has called you who also will do it." Now, if you look at that text in its context, you will find that Paul there is dealing with the sanctification of God's people.
[time=2956] God has a personal investment in the sanctification and the holiness of His people, those whom He has
[time=2963] called God is faithful and sanctifying them that they will come to that place of total commitment
[time=2971] and total consecration to the Lord in their lives.
[time=2974] The fourth text is 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 verse 3, where Paul says that the Lord is faithful
[time=2982] and He will protect you and strengthen you against the evil one, He's faithful in giving
[time=2988] you that protection and giving you that strength when you trust Him day after day.
[time=2993] The Lord doesn't want you to succumb to satanic temptations and satanic indulgences.
[time=3002] And then the next text, the fifth text is 2 Timothy, chapter 2 verse 13, where Paul says,
[time=3010] "If we are faithless," and indeed, that's true of all of us, is it not, that there are many times when, unfortunately, you're faithless and I'm faithless.
[time=3019] But Paul says, "If we are faithless yet, He abides faithful." That is, God is faithful.
[time=3026] He cannot deny Himself.
[time=3028] That's bringing us back to the fact that God's nature is a nature of integrity.
[time=3033] He cannot deny Himself and He cannot deny His Word or His promises.
[time=3038] The next text is Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23, where the author of Hebrews says, "Let us hold
[time=3047] fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He is faithful who is promised."
[time=3055] The Hebrews that the author is writing to are going through a difficult time, a perplexing time, and they need encouragement, and the encouragement that is given to them is that God is faithful in His time before Phil, His promises to you.
[time=3070] So therefore, hold on to your faith and to your hope without wavering.
[time=3076] The seventh text is 1 Peter, chapter 4 verse 19, where Peter challenges his readers who
[time=3083] are going through a fiery ordeal, and he says, "Let those who are suffering according to
[time=3089] the will of God entrust the keeping of their souls into the hands of a faithful creator."
[time=3095] God is a faithful creator.
[time=3096] He's all powerful, and if God, by His power, was able to bring this universe into existence
[time=3102] and creating the heavens and the earth, surely God has the power to sustain you and to sustain me when we're going through the fiery ordeal of life.
[time=3112] And finally, the eighth text is 1 John 1 verse 9, where John says, "If we confess our sins,
[time=3118] He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=3124] God is faithful in maintaining our fellowship with Christ.
[time=3127] He's faithful to us in our times of temptation and in our times of trial.
[time=3131] God is faithful to us in sanctifying us.
[time=3135] In making His holy and distinctive people, God is faithful in protecting us when we trust
[time=3141] in Him.
[time=3144] Some time ago, I read of a speedboat driver who had a near-fatal accident going at a
[time=3154] tremendously high speed, and his boat flipped over, and he was thrown out of his boat.
[time=3161] And he hit the water with such an impact that he was submerged beneath the surface into the deep, dark waters.
[time=3169] And he was disoriented and dizzy and topsy-turvy, not knowing what was up and what was down.
[time=3173] He hit that water with such an impact that he had his life jacket torn from him.
[time=3182] But even in his state of semi-consciousness, he had enough rationality to know, to hang on to that life jacket, which he did, and he found that he did so.
[time=3191] That life jacket gradually brought him to the surface where he was able to get that breath
[time=3197] of fresh air and to be revitalized again.
[time=3201] You know, there are times in your life and times in my life when we are submerged beneath
[time=3207] the surface, submerged into the deep, dark waters, disoriented, dizzy.
[time=3211] We don't know what's up.
[time=3213] I need a life jacket, and you need a life jacket, something to hold on to, something in our desperation that's going to bring us to the surface of my friend, the life jacket you need.
[time=3223] The life jacket that I need is the faithfulness of God.
[time=3226] God is faithful to His Word, faithful to His promises, and He's faithful to His people.
[time=3234] And then finally, I want you to notice in this farewell address of Joshua that after the
[time=3241] review and the responsibility and the recognition, we come now to the reminder in verse 15.
[time=3250] And here Joshua is reminding these elders of Israel, these officers of Israel who are
[time=3256] gathered before Him.
[time=3258] He reminds them that God is not only faithful in His grace, faithful in fulfilling His promises
[time=3264] when His promises are satisfied by means of their conditions, but God is also faithful
[time=3270] in carrying out His threats.
[time=3271] The God's threats are not spoken in vain, just as His promises are not spoken in vain.
[time=3277] And that God's threats are as real as God's promises are reliable and that God's threats
[time=3285] are as fearful as His commandments are rewarding.
[time=3292] And here Joshua is seeking to teach these elders that disobedience to the revealed Word
[time=3298] of God carries with it a high price.
[time=3301] And I want you to notice in verse 13, the graphic language that He uses.
[time=3304] He says to these elders, "If they're going to initiate a policy of disobedience rather
[time=3312] than passing on the torts, transmitting the faith, if they're going to initiate disobedience
[time=3318] and accommodate themselves to pagan culture, that they as a nation are going to experience.
[time=3323] See it for yourself now, the snares and the traps and the whips and the thorns."
[time=3331] You know, there are some decisions that we make that we're not careful in terms of our
[time=3337] choices.
[time=3339] The results, many times, can be drastic, they can be dire consequences.
[time=3344] In 1938, the then Prime Minister of Great Britain was Neville and Chamberlain.
[time=3351] As you may recall, he went to Munich that year and he sought to appease Adolf Hitler.
[time=3358] And he came back to London, England and he said, "Peace in our times, peace in our times."
[time=3364] You may recall that there was another leader in Great Britain by the name of Winston Churchill
[time=3370] and he knew that that peace was nothing but a shallow, faked peace.
[time=3375] And he got up in the English parliament and addressing his fellow parliamentarians.
[time=3380] He said, "You had the choice between war and dishonor.
[time=3385] You chose dishonor and now you're going to have war." And his words were prophetically true within a few months.
[time=3392] England was involved in war with Hitlerism.
[time=3406] But once again, it was our privilege to bring you music from our sanctuary choir with Scott Schindler directing and a special solo on the trumpet by Gary Kance.
[time=3416] The message today was from our guest speaker, Reverend Ron Scarf.
[time=3421] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3430] Our Father, I bow before you today and I'm thankful that I can do that.
[time=3435] And I want to tell you that I've sinned against you and I ask forgiveness for that sin.
[time=3440] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and become my Savior today.
[time=3445] In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=3449] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3453] And when you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
