[time=0] We're talking about the unrepentant heart, the heart that has known God and walked with
[time=8] God but has fallen into sin and now refuses to repent, confess, agree with God that what
[time=14] they have done is wrong and come back into a place of obedience.
[time=18] How is the church to help the believer with an unrepentant heart?
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=40] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=42] Thank you for joining us.
[time=44] The Bible says the heart is more deceitful than all else.
[time=47] As believers, we have an incredible capacity to rationalize our sin, to justify our disobedience
[time=54] and refuse to repent and broken confession before a holy God and those we have violated.
[time=59] Today Pastor Moore looks at one of the most powerful texts in all the New Testament, calling the church to assist a fallen brother back to repentance and obedience in his message entitled
[time=69] Restoring the Repentant Heart.
[time=71] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of Matthew.
[time=76] We will be looking in at chapter 18 verses 15 through 20.
[time=81] Our special music today features Joni King singing in heaven's eyes and celebrations singing
[time=88] a simple prayer as we begin our service today.
[time=91] Let's join our sanctuary choir in soloist Kevin Rowe as they sing right now is the right time.
[time=118] So let us thank him while we can, but tomorrow we might not have this chance.
[time=131] This is the hour and the time is right for everybody to praise the Lord, to praise the Lord.
[time=139] We rise now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=154] Now we look forward to the future, but tomorrow may never be, and the past is all behind
[time=183] us, it's just a part of history, so let us thank him while we can, but tomorrow we might
[time=193] not have this chance.
[time=195] You see this is the hour and the time is right for everybody to praise the Lord, to
[time=202] come on and praise the Lord, right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=218] There's no better time than the prayer time for raising a song towards heaven, right now,
[time=227] right now is the right time to praise the Lord, to praise the Lord.
[time=236] Now he has given us this moment, we'll never pass this way again.
[time=246] This is the day that the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad.
[time=253] Right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=257] Yeah, yeah, right now is the right time to be chosen what the Lord has done.
[time=267] There's no better time than the prayer time for raising a song towards heaven, right now,
[time=275] right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=283] Right now is the right time to be chosen what the Lord has done, so let us thank the Lord.
[time=293] There's no better time than the prayer time for raising a song towards heaven, right now, right now is the right time, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=310] Right now is right now, right now, right now, right now is the right time to praise the Lord.
[time=319] To praise the Lord, to praise the Lord, to praise the Lord, to praise the Lord.
[time=331] We appreciate David and his ministry and the ministry also have been quiet.
[time=348] Let's sing together, number 106, hymn number 106, praise him, praise him.
[time=357] We appreciate David and his ministry and his ministry also have been quiet.
[time=940] And it's just absolutely fantastic to anticipate the kind of ministry that we're going to be able to conduct in these buildings, the lives that we can shape and raise up for the cause of Christ.
[time=952] It's wonderful not just to live in the state of Indiana, but the United States of America where we can build buildings and have the confidence that once they're up, we can use them in a way that allows us to train up a godly generation.
[time=964] That's the steel for the gym right there and they have that on and they're ready to roll with the gymnasium roof.
[time=971] Man that's exciting. Well thank you and we'll look forward to opportunities to continue to update you as we move along and we're of course looking for maybe December, January as a move in date.
[time=983] So we have ways to go and we would appreciate your prayers as we continue to move in this direction.
[time=989] Our men are constantly looking for opportunities to be a witness for the cause of Christ as we interact with contractors and the like.
[time=995] So pray not just for the construction of the building but for our testimony and our witness to some fine men of Fort Wayne who we would love to see embrace the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1005] You know our country also at one point has wonderful freedom but that freedom can be misused and can be turned back against strong and healthy families.
[time=1015] And certainly we are finding that happening on a unbelievable rate and the music that our kids are exposed to, the media, the television, the movies, the whole thing.
[time=1024] We really have abandoned the moral absolutes on which our country was built. We want to suggest some helpful hints as to how to best grow your family in the grace of God.
[time=1035] We have an offer this month it's entitled How to Grow a Happy Family. It's by Audi Gatis and we really are excited about this book.
[time=1043] It's not too complicated. It has some helpful hints and it's just another tool in your toolbox as you try to build a godly family.
[time=1050] Also we have a film coming up the 29th here at church that's a Wednesday night at 7 o'clock and titled Children at Risk.
[time=1057] And again these would just be two helpful little tools we would offer to you as fellow members of the city of Fort Wayne as we're all trying to love and serve God and raise godly families.
[time=1068] And we're thankful for your participation in the gospel with us.
[time=1072] Well now we'll return back to the regularly scheduled portion of our service and we want to just encourage you. Thank you for being a part of our time together and let you know we're praying for you.
[time=1102] We're beginning that we receive. It is a part that we are part of and it is a time that we are more to eternal life.
[time=1123] Make me an instrument of your peace. I want to know what it's like to follow you.
[time=1136] When they look at me I want them to see the light of the world inside.
[time=1152] It is a gift that we receive. It is a part that we are part of and it is a time that we are born to eternal life.
[time=1175] Make me an instrument of your peace. I want to know what it's like to follow you.
[time=1188] When they look at me I want them to see the light of the world inside.
[time=1204] It is a gift that we receive. It is a part that we are part of and it is a time that we are born to eternal life.
[time=1227] Make me an instrument of your peace. I want to know what it's like to follow you.
[time=1240] When they look at me I want them to see the light of the world inside.
[time=1281] It was spring time. The time when kings go to battle. The David sent Joab and his servants and all of Israel.
[time=1301] They defeated the Ammonites and besieged Rava but David stayed in Jerusalem.
[time=1315] When evening had come he arose from his bed and walked around the roof of the king's palace and he saw a woman bathing and she was very beautiful in appearance.
[time=1332] I want to talk with you this morning about restoring an unrepentant heart, a heart that is walked with God, a heart that has known the joy of obedience before God but has chosen to step into sin and now is unwilling to be restored.
[time=1349] Hardhearted, no confession, no agreeing with God that what has been done is wrong, no being restored back into relationship with God.
[time=1359] David inquired as the beautiful woman and found her name to be Bathsheba, the wife of Yeraya the Hittite.
[time=1366] He then sent for her with his messenger. She came to the palace and he lay with her.
[time=1372] When they were finished she returned back to her home. What is missing is his repentance.
[time=1377] What is missing in the narrative is that he then fell on the floor and prostrated before God and cried out for forgiveness and called for the elders and called for the high priest and tried to find a way to be forgiven of his sin.
[time=1392] Instead just silence, it was broken some months later when Bathsheba sent him a message and said, "I am with child."
[time=1400] I am pregnant. I am going to have a baby and it is yours. And that too should have been enough to drive the man to his knees in repentance, realizing that his sin is now infected or imposed itself upon another life in a different way, a stronger way, a more permanent way, the life of a child.
[time=1420] But instead again calling on the name of the Lord for forgiveness, he called for his messengers, sent them out to the battle lines and said to Joab, "Send me Yeraya."
[time=1431] And Yeraya came back and after making some preliminary small talk about how the battle was going, King David dismissed him and encouraged him to return to his home and spend some time there.
[time=1443] With all due respect, Yeraya departed from the presence of the King, found and made his bed on the doorstep of the palace with all the King's men, refused to go to his house that night.
[time=1456] David heard about it.
[time=1459] Of course, David's desire is to cover up his own sin.
[time=1463] He only desires not to repent, but to cover his sin and that didn't work, so he calls Yeraya back and said, "Yeraya, why didn't you go down there and be with your family?"
[time=1475] Then Yeraya said, "The Ark of the Covenant and all of Israel and all of Judah are intense and Joab my leader and all his men are sleeping in temporary conditions.
[time=1492] How can I go into my house and eat and drink and lie with my wife?" And then he looked at David and said, "David, by your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing."
[time=1506] So David invited him to the King's party that night, got him drunk, inebriated, in hopes that his moral fiber and character would break down and he would go enjoy the pleasures of his home.
[time=1518] But when the party was done and Yeraya was drunk, he didn't go home, he again made his bed on the doorstep of the King's palace.
[time=1526] How much more conviction do you need to repent of your sin?
[time=1529] Here is a valiant servant of yours, a warrior risking his life for the nation in the country.
[time=1533] You call him back and try to lead him into a wonderful pleasure of his own wife, but there's too much integrity.
[time=1540] There's too much commitment to the things of God and too much solidarity with the men he was fighting with.
[time=1545] Here's a man of integrity. Again it should have drove and David right to his knees. The comparison was stark.
[time=1554] But instead the next day he called for Yeraya again and this time handed him a note written to Joab and it was Yeraya's own death note as you remember.
[time=1563] It instructed Joab to put Yeraya in the heat of the battle with the valiant men and then when things really got hot to withdraw support from Yeraya and let him die.
[time=1576] Yeraya carried the message, I suspect Yeraya knew what was going on the whole time.
[time=1583] He handed the message to Joab, Joab completed the task. And when Joab sent message back to David, he told the messenger, "Now you make sure you tell King David that when it is learned that I sent the troops too close to the wall and the archer shot a remedial blunder for a man of Joab's experience."
[time=1604] The anger of David Kindles and says what in the world was Joab thinking when he did that then say to him and also your servant Yeraya the Hittite is dead.
[time=1617] Again powerful words that should have brought conviction to the heart of King David who now not only murdered the one but the others in the process.
[time=1629] No repentance. Hard, hard, unrepentant, hard.
[time=1637] It says that after the death of Yeraya that David took Bathsheba into the castle, he married her and she bore him a son.
[time=1643] So we have some reference to time. It's been nearly a year.
[time=1649] The man carries not only the adultery but now the sin around like a heavy millstone around his neck and his heart is breaking and crushed inside but he refuses.
[time=1658] To repent and be restored to his God.
[time=1663] There are people like that in our church.
[time=1668] There may be a day when I'll be that way and you'll need to come because I'll have an unrepentant heart.
[time=1674] There are some of you today that have unrepentant hearts.
[time=1677] You've been carrying your sin and it's heavy regardless. You won't repent.
[time=1684] And the question this morning is how does the church respond to an unrepentant heart?
[time=1689] What is this church? What is the church of Jesus Christ? This one and all the other ones like it around the world.
[time=1695] How are the believers to respond to another brother when he falls into sin and refuses to repent?
[time=1704] The answer to that question is found in Matthew chapter 18.
[time=1707] If you take your Bible and turn there, let's look at that passage for a few minutes this morning. We'll look at five points out of Matthew chapter 18.
[time=1716] If you're taking notes, we'll look at the purpose, the person, the provocation, the process and the power and we'll call it church discipline.
[time=1734] Matthew chapter 18 starts in verse 15. Let me read you follow along. We'll get down to verse 20.
[time=1744] And if your brother sins, go and approve him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
[time=1751] But if he does not listen to you, take one or two more with you so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every fact may be confirmed.
[time=1759] And if he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax gather.
[time=1770] Truly, I say to you, whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatever you lose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again, I say to you that if two of you agree on earth about anything, that they may ask it shall be done for them by my father who is in heaven for where two or three witnesses have gathered together in my name.
[time=1789] There I am in their midst.
[time=1793] Five elements or parts of church discipline, the purpose, the person, the provocation, the process, and the power. First, the purpose.
[time=1806] You'll notice in verse 15 it says, and if your brother sins, go and approve him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother.
[time=1815] Remember two weeks ago, we were studying this topic over in Galatians chapter 6 and it says that if your brother has fallen in sin, go and restore your brother, Katartizo, it was a word that was used to describe the setting of a bone or the mending of the net to bring it back to a place of usefulness.
[time=1833] That's a wonderful picture of what we're to do when a brother falls into sin. This word is different though.
[time=1838] This word is a commercial word. It's a businessman's word. It means to acquire wealth. It means to secure the contract. I have won the contract. I have landed the deal. I have got the financial gain. It's a commercial financial term.
[time=1853] And in the context, what it's saying is that when one of our brothers or sisters inside this church falls into sin, steps off the path into disobedience, we are to view that person as treasure that has been lost that needs to be regained.
[time=1872] That's a beautiful concept. There is no judgment there. There is no discrimination. There is no belittling of an individual when the person steps out of obedience. We view them as a treasure and we seek to regain the treasure.
[time=1887] And that makes real good sense to some of you men who are in the process in your business of daily gaining contracts or losing contracts. And you get close and you work hard and you sell your company and you sell your product for all your worth and some men are going to make a decision about you.
[time=1904] You are completely single-minded and dedicated within the bounds of integrity to doing anything and everything together that treasure. And that is exactly why the Lord uses that term. Use that kind of energy, have that kind of spirit and dedication.
[time=1921] By plain tickets and fly where you need to fly, fax things, buy books, give additional information, meet at any time of the day, buy the meal, don't buy the meal. Whatever it takes to gain that contract, that treasure back into your life, Jesus says do it.
[time=1937] Because your brother or sister is like a treasure in the kingdom of God. He must be restored.
[time=1945] I remember as a young boy with my grandfather, Russell B. Seymour, the one after whom I was named. That's where I got my name Russell. He was a federal judge. I always respected him. He had a huge intellect. I only wish some of it, more of it maybe would have come my way.
[time=1959] I remember when his wife gave him a beautiful golden watch. I was there that Christmas Eve. And I always looked at it and when we would walk together and talk with it, it would always catch my eye. And I always thought to myself, man, I'd love to have a watch like that.
[time=1977] And when my grandfather was nearing his death, the offer came from him, through my mother. And as it was to all the other grandchildren, would there be one thing that had special meaning to you that you'd like to have?
[time=1991] And I submitted my request. I'd like to have his watch. And shortly after his death, I received it in the mail. And I wear it.
[time=2000] And when I look at the time, I don't just look at the time, I look at memories, and I look at family, and I look at his integrity, and all he was in his workplace.
[time=2011] The day I was playing golf, and when you play golf, you're wise not to wear a watch, especially if you really like it. It's real hard when you swing.
[time=2018] And normally I'll take my watch, and I'll put it in my golf bag. And so it's there when I need it. And after we played around a golf, we were driving away. We were 10 or 15 minutes away from the course. There was a friend with me in the car, and suddenly I looked to check the time, and I didn't have my watch on.
[time=2034] And there was no discussion. I just immediately pulled the car over. The guy wonders what I'm doing. I yank the keys out. I run to the back. I open the glove. I mean the trunk of the car. I'm thinking now that I put the watch where I normally put it in my golf bag, or that I put it in the little compartment in the golf cart, and it's still there, and somebody's stolen it, and I'll never see it again.
[time=2054] I was panicked, adrenaline rushing through my body for this keepsake, this treasure of mine. So I rummaged through my golf bag and sure enough, there it is. Here it is. My treasure, it's not much, means the world to me.
[time=2074] Jesus says when a brother or a sister falls into the sin of the world, retrieve that person as you would your most prized possession.
[time=2088] So the purpose of church discipline is not to be harsh and judgmental that is instead with the heart of when seeking lost treasure to bring valuable possessions back into the fold.
[time=2102] Who does it? The person, first the purpose, then the person. Look again in verse 15, and as I read it, you pay close attention to the word you and your.
[time=2113] Verse 15, "And if your brother sins, go and approve him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother."
[time=2121] Guess who the star is in that verse? You, not me, not the pastor, not the elders, not the staff.
[time=2129] You are the star, the shining glorious star of that verse and of the restorative process and of church discipline.
[time=2140] Many of you have seen the movie Stand and Deliver. It's about a teacher who comes from the Barrio of East Los Angeles, Garfield High School 98% Hispanic.
[time=2151] He has been immortalized in this film because of his ability to train high school students to take the advanced placement exam and calculus and break all the odds and go on to secondary education and destroy a life script that would keep them in poverty.
[time=2170] And they have studied his teaching techniques as they have made the movie about him and yes he's a phenomenal communicator and yes he uses overhead grass and yes he has all kinds of creative ways and uses sarcasm and has a real sense of connection with that generation he's trying to communicate with but that's not why he gets his job done as effectively as he does.
[time=2194] Jaime Escalante holds kids accountable to meet his standard and he does it face to face.
[time=2203] And if you're in Jaime's class and you're falling behind academically you come in an hour early every day until you're caught up and if you can't come in an hour early then you come for two hours after classes over and Jaime is there to be with you and Jaime is there to walk through with you until you understand the material and can perform.
[time=2220] And if you don't come to your early session or your late session then he calls your mom and dad and if he can't get your mom and dad in normal hours he calls your dad at 5 a.m. and wakes him up and says I haven't seen your son lately.
[time=2237] You see we applaud that in our hearts we say here is a guy that cares enough about the disadvantage of Los Angeles the kids where all the odds are against them they're malnutrition they don't have family units they have drugs and alcohol running rampant through their streets and gangs and everything else he's fighting the whole host of demons in this effort to train kids for college.
[time=2261] But he is dedicated to his cause he does it face to face he sets a standard he says I will walk with you and tell you attain it and he trains more kids than anybody else in the United States of America for the advanced placement tests.
[time=2276] And we applaud that because it's right why do we have so much trouble taking that very concept out of education and placing it within the spiritual confines of the church.
[time=2289] What Jesus is calling for here are for individuals high me escalantes of the Christian world who care enough about their brothers and sisters in Christ who when they begin to fail the tests say I am with you and if it's at 5 a.m. or if it's for two hours after work you can count on me being in your life until you are again passing the test of obedience in your life.
[time=2312] It's you and nobody else you're responsible and I'm responsible you say what do I do when I go look at verse 15 again and if your brother sins go and approve there are two verbs right there go and approve the main verb is go the first thing we got to do is we got to get off dead center and go find our brother or our sister who has fallen into sin.
[time=2338] And then it says to approve them and that is a tremendous word it means not anywhere near close to beat them up or judge them or condemn them it means to turn the flashlight on their behavior it means to bring light to the situation open it up so that it's clear and visible.
[time=2355] Because as you know Jeremiah 179 the heart is deceitful above all else and is desperately sick who can understand it as human beings and our wicked hearts we have an incredible capacity to justify and rationalize our sinful behavior and put walls up around us and feel smug and complacent in our sin.
[time=2376] And it takes somebody to come along and turn the light on and say look see.
[time=2384] Remember after David had murdered Yeraya he then took Bathsheba as his wife and it says in the end of verse chapter 11 there in second Samuel it says that she bore the son.
[time=2397] So the reference to time 12 some 12 months probably as this whole thing works out that he holds and harbors his murder and his adultery.
[time=2408] Until finally chapter 12 opens up and says God sent Nathan the prophet and Nathan shows up in the court of the king and Nathan is now going to approve Nathan is now going to reach over and turn the light switch on in David's life.
[time=2423] And Nathan tells a story David in your kingdom there is a man who has this fabulously large flock or herd of sheep.
[time=2434] He's got more of him than he knows what to do with. And there's another man in your kingdom who has but one little you lamb and then Nathan goes on to describe the tender care with which this you lamb was bought.
[time=2444] He says he bought it with his own money he took it into his own house the you lamb ate from his bread drink from his wine he carried him in his bosom and he treats him as one of his children.
[time=2454] He loves a little you lamb it's the only one he's got. And then Nathan says and that rich man with all those you lambs took from the one man with his one you lamb.
[time=2468] And David says that man deserves to die and then Nathan looks at the king who can snuff his life in a heartbeat and says thou art the man.
[time=2482] You're the one David it's you repent and then Nathan went on as prophesied by the Lord to describe that the sword should never leave his house.
[time=2497] That he would David would be embarrassed though he had done his sin and secret David would have his own wives taken by another in public which eventually happened.
[time=2505] And he said the son will die and the sword will never depart from your house. And David being aware of then his own sin and the consequences of his sin finally said I have sinned before the Lord.
[time=2524] Finally he confesses finally he repents.
[time=2534] So the purpose the person and then thirdly the provocation.
[time=2540] In other words whenever you talk about church discipline people want to know well which sins are big enough to be involved in church discipline.
[time=2546] Well look again in verse 15 and if your brother sins that's how the Lord described it as sin the word is on Martino since a Greek word that says you've missed the mark and the picture behind the word is that of an archer who's drawn his bow and tries to shoot the target but misses the target.
[time=2562] You've missed the mark of obedience in your life and it's a broad word it's the broadest word for sin anywhere in the New Testament.
[time=2569] Jesus grabs the junk word for sin of the New Testament and says here if your brother sins he makes it as broad as he possibly can.
[time=2577] And you remember if you were here two weeks ago we were looking at Galatians 6 and it says if your brother steps off the path of obedience and the context took us back to chapter 5 and it was the deeds of the flesh versus the deeds of the spirit.
[time=2588] And there again it's a very broad definition of sin. If a person is not walking according to the spirit they're walking according to the deeds of the flesh and if they're in the deeds of the flesh they're sinning and they deserve your loving character retrieve them as treasure back in the fold of God.
[time=2602] It's not just adultery or divorce or murder or child molestation some of the real biggies.
[time=2610] It is as simple as a person stepping out of obedience to the word and the will of God in their life and walking away from the ministry of the spirit of God to lead them on a day to day basis and falling into the deeds of the flesh.
[time=2622] Some of your Bibles will read in verse 15 and if your brother sins against you and people have taken that phrase and interpreted it that this only applies if the brother has sinned immediately and directly against you.
[time=2635] I mean if he walked up and punched you in the nose or he committed adultery with your wife and that really is an unnecessary limitation of the truth in this passage.
[time=2645] The solidarity of the body of Christ couldn't be any more clearly taught we are one when one member stumbles or hurts all members are affected we all need to minister our spiritual gifts together or the body is damaged and hurt.
[time=2657] We are sinned against whether directly or indirectly when somebody in our church steps off the path of obedience and we corporately have responsibility for our brother.
[time=2670] So there is no limitation there is no special list of sins and there is no restricting agent that you had to have immediate first hand knowledge of it because it was happening against you.
[time=2683] Now the process, what is the process how do we restore the unrepentant heart what is the procedure that God gives us and there are four steps in the process the first we've looked at verse 15.
[time=2696] If your brother sins you go and approve him in private open up his sin help him see what he has done and it says there in verse 15 if he listens to you you've won your brother it's over it's done he's restored he's back in the fold the whole process stops nothing else to be done.
[time=2712] But then verse 16 but if he does not listen to you take one or two more with you so that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every fact may be confirmed that's a quote from Deuteronomy 1915 and it's a basic ingredient of trying a person or being sure that you're not being biased or being set up or framed by other people.
[time=2736] It's just a general basic precaution against people framing other people and what it means is is that these two witnesses are now to accompany the one who went first and it does not mean witness in the sense that they witnessed the sin itself they have come not to witness the sin itself and they don't have to have seen the sin itself they come to witness that the heart is still unrepentant.
[time=2761] Verse 15 says go by yourself and gain your brother when your brother bring a repentant heart and if you're unsuccessful in that then bring one or two witnesses more in other words to confirm the fact that the individual you're seeking to restore is still unrepentant.
[time=2778] Why? Because the next step is to tell it to the church and you shouldn't ever tell anything to the church based on one person needs several from just pure wisdom.
[time=2791] Verse 17, step 3 and if he refuses to listen to them in other words they've gone not just to hear but they've gone to talk and plead and beg.
[time=2799] Now there's three people sitting in your living room and they're begging you to return from the error of your way but you continue to have a rebellious unrepentant heart and they say what are you doing and they leave your presence they come back to the church and they tell the church.
[time=2816] Why? So then all of us can go and try to seek the restoration of this fallen brother.
[time=2824] Now all of us who here to four may not have even known of the problem are alerted to it and we find our avenues of connection whether phone calls or cards or visits and we do everything in our power to draw this wayward soul back into obedience to the word and the will of God.
[time=2848] Now step 4, also in verse 17 the middle of the verse and if he refuses to listen even to the church let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax gather. What does that mean?
[time=2862] This book was written by a Jew, two Jews about a Jew, Jesus Christ. It's written to the Jewish audience to present Jesus Christ as King and they would have immediately being Jews have understood the meaning of you treat him as a Gentile.
[time=2874] A Gentile was an outsider. It was an outsider by his own choice. They would have preferred that the outsider come inside but the Gentile continued on in his way so he is an outsider and then he adds a tax gatherer and a tax gatherer was a person who was a Jew had lived with the nation of Israel but now under the Roman government had sold his soul to the Roman government had been a traitor to his people and was now used as an informant and as a tax gatherer against his own people.
[time=2902] So a tax gatherer is one who was in the family but by choice and as a rebels heart has chosen to step outside the family.
[time=2911] With an unrepentant heart you go seeking by yourself to restore the treasure to the family of God. There is still in repentance you take two or three witnesses with you.
[time=2921] They confirm also in pleading as they are. They confirm the unrepentant heart. We tell it to the entire church. Everybody who knows that person, people who don't even know that person go out of concern for their soul and it's no, no, no, no. I will not repent. You put them out of the church.
[time=2940] You treat them as a Gentile as an outsider. Come with me, will you over to 2 Thessalonians 3 for just a second? I want to show you the same thing in another passage.
[time=2953] 2 Thessalonians chapter 3 here the church at Thessalonica is applying and being called to apply the very words of our Lord and Matthew 18.
[time=2965] 2 Thessalonians 3, 6, verse 6. 2 Thessalonians 3, verse 6. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you keep aloof from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according to the tradition which you received from us.
[time=2985] You need to identify, find and mark the people who are not obeying the commandment of the Lord Jesus Christ. They are leading an unruly life.
[time=2996] Keep aloof from them. Treat them as an outsider in other words. Look over it verse 14. And if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take special note of that man and do not associate with him.
[time=3013] So that, look at that next phrase. So that he may be put to shame. A lot of times when I talk with people about church discipline, they're very well intending people, but they misunderstand the whole process.
[time=3029] They say to you, now wait a minute, we have a very delicate situation here. This person, indeed the person has sinned, but the person is hurting and they're downcast and they're feeling the need and the love of the support of the church.
[time=3045] I mean, how can you possibly contemplate taking this person now at their greatest point of need when they fall into sin and putting them out of the church? You'll be driving people away. You'll be driving people out of the church.
[time=3057] Exactly. If you've gone about it as the steps reveal with a loving heart, seeking a person as a treasure, going with another, then going as a church, that's exactly what God wants to happen.
[time=3070] He wants that person to be put to shame and put outside of the church itself so that they can feel the full consequences of their sin in hopes of their repentance.
[time=3083] Can I show you to another passage? Come with me over to 1 Corinthians chapter 5. It's even planar.
[time=3093] The heart is always restoration. The method at points is severe because this man's soul is at stake.
[time=3103] 1 Corinthians chapter 5 will begin in verse 1. It is actually reported that there is immorality among you and immorality of such a kind does not exist even among the Gentiles that someone has his father's wife.
[time=3119] This is commonly referred to as the incessed man. He is having sex with his stepmother. We believe it's a stepmother because she is referred to as his father's wife instead of his own mother.
[time=3129] His father probably has a second wife and the son is now having sexual relationship with the wife of his father.
[time=3136] Incessed. Verse 2. And you have become arrogant and have not mourned instead in order that one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst.
[time=3146] Exactly. That is exactly what Paul wants to happen. That is exactly what Christ wants to happen. Remove that person from your midst.
[time=3155] Again, you have to keep it in the light of all the rest of the New Testament about discipline. It's not just an immediate thing where you find out about it and you throw them out.
[time=3163] The heart is restoration. The heart is seeking a treasure. It's a long, laborious time-consuming effort through step 1, step 2, step 3. But when all is said and done and there is still a repentant heart, put them out of your midst.
[time=3176] Why? Verse 3. For I on my part, though absent embody but present in spirit, have already judged him who has so committed this, as though I were present.
[time=3187] In the name of our Lord Jesus, whom you are assembled, and I with you in spirit, with the power of the Lord Jesus, remember that phrase, the power of the Lord Jesus.
[time=3196] Now watch verse 5. "I have decided to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=3207] This is not Paul sending this man to hell. This is not Paul saying, "Boy, we're going to fix him. We'll throw him out of the church. We'll deliver him over to Satan."
[time=3215] He can just squander there in that painful state of absolute misery. Paul says, "The man has an incredibly unrepentant heart. We have got to gain his repentance and his confession."
[time=3229] So having walked through the first three steps, we put him out so he can feel the full consequences of his sin, the destruction of his flesh by Satan, which is simply being put outside the company of the redeemed.
[time=3243] He can feel the consequences of his sin in hopes that he will repent and be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ, meaning if a man were to continue on an unrepentant sin, the rest of his life, he would reveal that he was never really saved in the first place.
[time=3258] Look at verse 6, "Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven's the whole lump of dough." He goes on to say, "Don't you understand? If as a church you allow that kind of sin to be accepted to be tolerated within your church, it will work like leaven in a loaf of dough, and pretty soon the sin will consume your church. It'll spread through the whole thing."
[time=3282] There's a misunderstanding about the church. Some people feel the church should be an accommodating, accepting body of believers who have nothing but love.
[time=3293] No matter what you do, we love you. No matter what you do, we accept you. We will not pass judgment on you. We will not, we will in no way ever point you out or identify you as one who has sinned for that would be judgmental.
[time=3307] No, my friends, you know what that's called? That's called your local bar. Have you ever watched cheers? That's cheers. You can come into cheers, the bar there on TV, and you can have done anything under the sun. You can espouse any view of reality you want, any kind of conduct, and all you find there is unconditional acceptance and love, and everybody thinks, "See, I'd rather have friends in a bar than friends with the people in that church. They're judgmental."
[time=3336] Let me tell you about the church. The church is a place of unconditional love. You can do nothing to estranged my heart from you. You are my treasure. You are the treasure of Christ bought with the blood of Christ.
[time=3353] And when I see you in sin, I want to commit your life and mend your net and heal the broken bone. There's nothing you could do.
[time=3361] The most vile sin, there's nothing you could do to shake my unconditional love of you. But let me help you out. There is conditional acceptance. There is conditional acceptance.
[time=3375] Because I love you enough to confront you in your sin, to call you to the standard of the Word of God, and to treat you and your unrepentant heart in the exact way in which our Lord himself defined for us in Matthew 18.
[time=3389] And that is after I've gone in private, and I've gone with my friends, and we've gone as a church, and you're still unrepentant, you're out.
[time=3398] Are you still in your own first Corinthians? Let me go back for a minute.
[time=3410] If as a result of today's message you feel the Lord prompting your heart to accept Him as Lord and Savior, would you pray with me?
[time=3419] But I know that I'm a sinner, I know that I have fallen short of the Holy Righteous Standard, which you call every human being to. I confess my sin, I admit that I have violated your law, and I accept the forgiveness, and the freedom from the power of sin and death that comes through faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3438] Thank you for that, a gift of salvation, in Jesus name, amen. If you've made this decision to accept Christ, it's the greatest decision you've ever made in your life, we would love to share in the joy.
