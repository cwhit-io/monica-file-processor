[time=0] the state of spiritual leadership and the church of America is in a desperate
[time=6] condition. Hardly a week goes by that we don't hear of yet another pastor falling into sin. And the passage that is in front of us this morning is Paul's remedy for ungodly church leadership. In fact he's talking about restoring godly leadership of the church.
[time=34] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be in encouragement. Thank you for joining us. The integrity of leaders in the church today may be at an all-time low. The American people have seen leaders in the business world, the political arena, even in the church, to violate the most basic standards of honesty, financial responsibility and moral purity. Today Pastor Moore explains the steps which must
[time=60] be taken to restore godly leadership in the church. His message today is entitled Restoring godly leadership in the church. We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy. We'll be looking in at chapter 5 verses 19 through 25. Our special music today features our
[time=78] sanctuary required singing all hail the power of Jesus name and a solo from Kerry Johnson entitled for all the world. As we begin our service today let's listen to our trumpet trio accompanied by Scott Schindler on the piano as they perform stand-up stand-up for Jesus.

[time=374] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour. Also I got up early this morning and watch last week's program. I was on vacation but I really enjoyed every aspect of the program this morning. Well Peter it's uncomfortable being involved in this ministry without your help. Welcome back. Where have you been? What have you been doing and did you have a good time? Well we visited our children you know they're leaving the nest one by one. Peter is in Chicago and we had a great time with him and we met some of our friends who are pastors in that area went to church in Fox Valley St. Charles Illinois area and last Sunday we had a great pleasure of going down to Salem, Indiana where our son-in-law Scott calls as the new pastor.
[time=413] That was his second week in the pulpit and we had a great time with their congregation looks like they're excited about the ministry down there in Salem. I know Lisa and Scott are and need to continue praying for them because the first ministry is always exciting but not without its difficulties. We do pray for
[time=432] them and we're also very very thankful that you're back and that we'll again get to experience your ministry with us. It was a good rest and we are really glad to be back. I want all of you to be watching in the mail in just a couple weeks we're going to give you a schedule of some of the events that take place at Black Hawk Baptist Church this fall. There are many activities and we want you to be aware of them. Some of them don't take place on Sundays so you might be free to join with us or continue with the summer celebration as we continue to watch a film entitled Children at Risk. It's a Dopson film certainly one that every parent
[time=465] should see as we defend the rights of our children and defend those things
[time=471] that they should see and should not see even in the classroom and around the world. So I hope that you'll join with us in our continuation of our summer celebration on August 5th at 7 p.m. 7 p.m. right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=486] And looking forward again to August 16th on Sunday evening at 6 p.m. we're going to have the King's Brass. Tim Zimmerman is probably one of the most outstanding trumpet players and he's put together other college professors who travel throughout the summer and they'll be with us on Sunday evening August 16th. Some of the finest, finest instrumental music that you will ever hear anywhere. So I want you to come and join with us. Then we have the
[time=513] privilege of having with us on August 30th on Sunday morning Dan and Donna Oxley. Again Dan is a trumpeter. He traveled with the young Messiah tour last
[time=523] year and just an outstanding instrumentalist and Donna sings and they'll be with us on Sunday morning August 30th at our 915 and 1050 services. I hope you'll
[time=535] join with us. Well also I watched the insert and you talked about how to grow a half of family the book that that we're offering this week. Actually all of the month of July and I look through this book in the early part of the summer and there are some charts and some just good guidelines. This is not for a family that's just really torn apart but for good Christian families who just need a little bit of help and a little bit of encouragement and some ideas to help their family grow spiritually. So the title of the book is how to grow a happy family and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne
[time=572] Indiana and the zip code is 46815. Once again that's the Bible Hour, 7400 East
[time=579] State, Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815. You know Russell this book is
[time=586] timely as we watch the the films that we're showing on our Wednesday even programs and also just the need for us to be very cognizant of the family. It's
[time=598] amazing how quickly quality time with your family can be stolen from you by our culture and how quickly we can give it away. Just yesterday I asked my wife if I could just take the kids all day long from the time we get up until the time we put them to bed and she agreed to that. Obviously she found some friends and went and had a little bit of a holiday for herself which I think was also needed but we just had the greatest time. We went to breakfast and we just found things to do and play games and finally talked to them into bed at the end of the night I felt like I was a lot closer to my kids than I had been before. I can't tell you last time I spent an entire day by myself with just my kids. I do think it's wonderful and as an older parent I encourage you to continue doing that and all of you that are out there. We picked up Andy yesterday was in Colorado for two weeks studying the various religions of the world and a support for Christianity
[time=648] had a wonderful time but I just realized how quickly as he enters his senior year he'll be gone from us but we praise the Lord for our children and praise the Lord for the privilege of Christian parents to rear them in an environment that's that's strong in the Christian faith and we continue to encourage all of you to
[time=667] be in church to have prayer time with your families and read God's word have study helps that will help you encourage your children to live for the Lord.
[time=675] We'll go back to the main portion of our service now with the Trumpetrial playing for us and then we'll have the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore. I hope that you're excited to stay tuned with us to listen to God's word and apply it to your heart today.
[time=705] Never was the world in such a need of peace and never has contentment been so hard to find.
[time=724] So many men reaching out their hands our brothers and sisters in
[time=735] so many lands he fed a kindness as we die and then it's crying out to us the time is now.
[time=757] I want the peace I want the love for all the world.
[time=764] People enjoy the children of hope for all the world and of life I will be your light that you shine through.
[time=779] Cause you are the peace and you are the hope for all the world.
[time=794] What's it gonna take until we show sincerity compassion and mercy the way it was meant to be.
[time=815] We'll take the time for the ones who truly need and pray for the nation and it's out in the street.
[time=830] What man is greater than his brother when in Jesus eyes are of the same.
[time=843] I want the peace I want the love for all the world.
[time=850] People enjoy the children of hope for all the world and of life I will be your light that you shine through.
[time=865] Cause you are the peace and you are the hope for all the world.
[time=874] Then it's on your freedom and teach it to watch the day of the Christ who freeing us and let the break of God clear the way.
[time=894] I want the peace I want the love for all the world.
[time=903] People enjoy the children of hope for all the world and of life I will be your light that you shine through.
[time=920] Cause you are the hope for all the world and of life I will be your light that you shine through.
[time=956] [AMEN]
[time=965] Thank you, Kerry.
[time=967] Well, if you have your Bibles with you this morning, I'll encourage you to take them and open to 1 Timothy chapter 5,
[time=974] where finally we will resume our study of chapter 5 verses 17 to 25.
[time=982] Have you ever noticed how tragic moments are indelibly carved into your mind and memory and heart?
[time=991] For example, where were you when desert shield went to desert storm?
[time=999] Can you remember who you were with, who told you?
[time=1005] Can you remember where you were and who you were with when the challenger exploded?
[time=1013] Some of you are answering that question to each other.
[time=1016] Can you, some of you remember, November 22nd, 1963, a Friday, and you got the word that President Kennedy had been assassinated?
[time=1027] Some of you are smiling and saying, "No, I can't remember." Wasn't born yet, praise God, yeah.
[time=1034] Others of you can remember the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7th, 1941.
[time=1042] What day of the week? It's a Sunday, that's right.
[time=1048] Tragedy moments have a way of setting themselves in our minds and the medical community tells us it's because when that kind of news of that kind of impact and import comes to us,
[time=1059] the adrenaline rushes through our body and whatever we're seeing or thinking or feeling at that moment finds a deeper seat in our ability to recall it from our memory.
[time=1068] I can remember sitting in my office and being called by a friend Joel Miller who worked at the college and he said, "Russell, you know, they've attacked."
[time=1077] And we were all anticipating Desert Storm.
[time=1080] Remember exactly what I had on, where I was, I can remember exactly what I had on and where I was and who I was with as I saw for the first time the challenger explode on the screen and the horror that went through my mind and my heart for those and the families involved.
[time=1093] Those are tragic moments in the life of our country.
[time=1097] The same is true with tragic moments in the life of the church, the life of the kingdom of God.
[time=1105] When tragic, horrible, devastating events happen in the life of the church, they too are etched into our minds and our memories.
[time=1115] There was a Sunday afternoon, I had come back from junior high outing when I was the junior high pastor at this particular church, a busload of kids, got them off the bus, took care of the bus, came back to the main campus, was walking across the campus when I was met by a fellow pastor Tim Jack.
[time=1133] He had on a short sleeve shirt with a blue white check and white pants and some sneakers on and he said, "Russell, I have to talk to you. There's been something tragic happen."
[time=1144] He said, "You need to sit down." So I sat down, going to step as did he.
[time=1149] He said, "One of our pastors here at church has fallen into sin." The tragic moment in the life of the church and the kingdom of God.
[time=1161] Some years later, I'll remember a Monday morning when I was again sitting in my office and a knock on the door and there stood Matt MacArthur.
[time=1169] Matt MacArthur's son and Matt was taking John's place in conveying this tragic news because John was busy trying to restore at the moment.
[time=1178] Matt invited me down to the boardroom there at the college where some of the other men who were leading the college met and Matt broke the news that one of the guys, the one guy that wasn't there, besides John, had fallen into sin.
[time=1192] And maybe you can remember, I hope you can't, but maybe you have a memory in your mind that in your heart of the news, of someone you had followed, someone who had led you in ministry, someone you had trusted, someone you as a body had put into leadership who had since fallen into sin.
[time=1212] If you can remember that emotion and see that moment, that is the very emotion and the very moment that is behind the passage we study this morning.
[time=1222] These people, these believers who are at Ephesus are finding out that men, they have put into leadership, some of them have come from within their church, some of them have come from outside their church, but men who are in pastor, teacher, positions, and elder positions have fallen into sin.
[time=1239] And these people are feeling the confusion that comes with that moment, they are asking the question, how in the world can this actually be happening to us and to that person, is it really him, did that really occur?
[time=1252] And once all those questions are resolved, then the next wave of question comes, who in the world can we trust?
[time=1259] Who is left for us to trust? That's what these people are feeling. And Paul writes this letter to Timothy and particularly this passage in this book of Timothy to tell people how to respond to that kind of situation.
[time=1279] And it is almost as if he anticipates our day. It's almost as if he knows exactly what would be going on in the evangelical climate of our day.
[time=1287] And we're not just talking about the Jim Bakers and the Jimmy Schwagherts.
[time=1291] We're talking about ordinary people who don't have their sin broadcasted on international television, but men in the ministry both professionally as pastors and elders who find their employment in other places are on a regular basis falling into sin and disqualifying themselves
[time=1308] from the ministry. And the question is, how in the world can we restore and maintain godly leadership in the church?
[time=1316] And that is the issue that he has addressing here. How can we restore and maintain godly leadership in the church, first at Ephesus and then secondly in our own day and age?
[time=1329] And he, if you're taking notes this morning, he gives four steps, four steps of restoring and maintaining godly leadership in the church.
[time=1338] And the first is found in verses 17 and 18, and we've looked at this some weeks ago when we studied it.
[time=1344] The first is that you are to honor godly leadership.
[time=1348] Verse 17, chapter 5, "Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. For the scripture says, you shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing, and the labor is worthy of his wages."
[time=1363] When a church has godly leadership, they are to honor that leadership, those men who stand in the gap and lead with conviction as they labor to the point of exhaustion and ruling well the flock that has been given to them by god.
[time=1378] Those men are worthy of respect and remuneration.
[time=1382] Those men should have held in the hearts of the people a deep sense of appreciation and respect for their ministry, and out of that would come a willingness to support them so that they can continue in that ministry.
[time=1393] And by, as I've said, we've looked at that before that by way, just a brief review.
[time=1398] The second thing that Paul calls us to, and that would be new material this morning is found in verse 19.
[time=1404] And it's that the church is to protect its godly leaders. Verse 19, "Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses."
[time=1416] There are commonly two responses by people to elders that teach the truth, two basic responses by people to elders who preach the truth.
[time=1428] The first reaction is one of conviction. When the truth is taught, they look at their lives, they see where they're in sin, they feel convicted over that, they feel humbled before god and broken, and they repent of that, and they are then thankful for that man in his ministry.
[time=1444] They are appreciative of his commitment to speak the truth in love.
[time=1452] And that was certainly true in the life of our Lord. As he ministered day in and day out with his apostles, and though they could never prior to the advent of the Spirit of God, Pentecost, prior to that day,
[time=1463] prior to that day, though they could never fully appreciate the truth he was giving them, or even who he was. After the day of Pentecost, it dawned on them the life-giving truth of being born again that was theirs because of the ministry of Christ, and all the principles that he had taught them, and all of them went to their death in appreciation and obedience to the truth that Christ had given them.
[time=1485] Murdered him. So deep was their thankful heart for the man who had come from heaven to teach the truth.
[time=1493] The same was true of the Apostle Paul, even the city of Ephesus, even the elders that were there, Acts chapter 20, you remember, he calls them to the island of my litus, and it says he had taught them the whole council of God.
[time=1505] Which means in the process of his three and a half years stay there, he had stepped on some toes, he had realigned some thinking, he had embarrassed some people, he had convicted people through the Spirit of God because there was air in their way.
[time=1519] But those men as they gathered on that day on the island of my litus, and realizing that as Paul said, "You will not see my face again," they fell upon his neck and wept and kissed him because they were so thankful for the truth they had received through that man and through his ministry.
[time=1534] And I would confess the same emotion in my heart for those who have given me the truth.
[time=1539] Blaine Gibbs, the man that discipled me the first year of my life as I sat at his feet and learned and listened and as he took the word of God as a sharp two-edged sword and pierced through the sin in my life and exposed it and cut deeply the things out of my life,
[time=1555] at least at the level he could reach at that point of my maturity. And to this day I am thankful for that, to this day I am thankful for his ministry in my life and I appreciate him.
[time=1566] There is, though, a second response to elders who teach the truth.
[time=1570] There is a response that does not bring conviction, there is no brokenness and therefore there is no appreciation.
[time=1578] Instead there is a hard-hearted heart that is sick and tired of having this truth teacher expose them, Sunday after Sunday after Sunday and anger begins to kindle in their heart and they eventually do what is being mentioned in verse 19, they make accusation against that man.
[time=1596] The word accusation is a compound word in the Greek, it's composed of two different words, agura, which means a public meeting place and kata, which means against.
[time=1605] Some people will take a person who teaches the truth and bring accusation against them in some public forum because they are sick and tired of being revealed and exposed as not meeting the standard that Christ has for them.
[time=1617] And when that happens one would remind himself that he is in good company because the exact same thing happened to Christ.
[time=1624] Christ came and spoke nothing but truth and spoke nothing but truth in love and never sinned and never hurt or did anything wrong to anybody.
[time=1633] But the religious leaders of his day were so upset and convicted by his message and angry at him for exposing their false religious system.
[time=1644] Early in his ministry they discredit him by saying this is just Jesus of Nazareth, just is just Joseph's son, he's a nobody, don't pay attention to him.
[time=1653] But he was relentless in his pursuit and preaching of the truth and eventually they said he's crazy and then finally they said these miracles, these prove that he's really of Satan, he's really of the demons, he's really of the underworld and they attacked his person because they knew they couldn't attack the words that he said that was just raw truth.
[time=1676] Say you happen to the Apostle Paul and if you want to read through the books of 1st and 2nd Corinthians you'll find over and over again his need to defend himself against other men making false accusations against him to the church he was ministering to.
[time=1689] They attacked his apostleship, they said you aren't really an apostle, you're not an authentic man of the cloth or the apostleship of Jesus Christ, they attacked his motives and said he did it for money instead of for love and to please God and they attacked his method.
[time=1703] They took every avenue they could to attack and discredit and demean his ministry and the same thing happened to Timothy and you can see that just turn back a page to chapter 4, look at verse 12.
[time=1717] Look at what these men were doing, remember now this part of the book is Paul instructing Timothy as to how he should conduct himself in his ministry and verse 12 it says let no one look down on your youthfulness.
[time=1729] Apparently these ungodly elders that had crept in like savage wolves into the church at Ephesus were being uncomfortable with Timothy's teaching the truth and Timothy's exposing them as ungodly elders and so they began to attack him and the only thing they could find was his youthfulness.
[time=1744] Again that is an ad hominem when you no longer attack the subject matter but you attack the person behind the subject matter and they were apparently discrediting him for some of the weaknesses and shortcomings of being young.
[time=1757] And Paul said don't let him look down on you for that rather in your speech and your conduct and your love and your faith and your purity show yourself an example of those who believe.
[time=1766] So it is not an unfamiliar experience to be attacked in some public forum by people who do not want to receive the truth that the word of God demands.
[time=1777] And what Paul says is to be done is verse 19 do not receive an accusation against him. Don't even hear it unless it's based upon two or three witnesses.
[time=1787] The word receive means to entertain, to look into, to investigate. Don't even give it a thought. Don't even take a step further in the process.
[time=1797] The closest I have been in this process and it's happened on several different occasions is people will write letters against me. And they'll in these letters oftentimes fill them with ad hominem, things they don't like about me or my personality or how I do things.
[time=1812] Oftentimes those letters have been unsigned and I am thankful that those for whom I am to whom I am accountable both as this happened in California and other places these individuals don't even read it they just throw it in the trash which is exactly where it belongs.
[time=1828] Do not even receive an accusation against an elder. The mature church understands that a person who is committed to teaching the truth and even a church itself that will stand for the truth in the community will become the subject of all kinds of accusations about that church and about its leadership because they stand for the truth and sinful people don't want to hear the truth and so they lash out in self defense by accusing those who stand for the truth.
[time=1856] It's been happening since the prophets of the Old Testament. It happened to Jesus. It happened to Paul. It happened to Timothy and it happens to us. It goes with the territory.
[time=1867] Now I want you to notice in verse 19 that it says accept on the basis of two or three witnesses. This is not some carte blanche immunity to accountability to the flock of God for leaders.
[time=1878] Some would say that man you know if you're a man of the cloth and you've been called to the ministry nobody dares say anything against you. Nobody dare even question you or approach you on some practice in your life. That's not what this is saying at all.
[time=1891] This is not some ivory tower that can never be reached by the common Christian and finding refuge and safety there is the elder who just parades his life without any accountability before anybody. That's not what this is saying.
[time=1904] This is saying and this is why we went back to Galatians chapter 6 and weeks past and then we looked at Matthew 18 to understand the process of church discipline.
[time=1912] This is saying until that elder has been treated with the same dignity and the same respect and the same effort for restoration that you would give everybody else.
[time=1921] In other words until you've gone to him by yourself and talked to him about his sin and until then if he doesn't repent of his sin if indeed he was in sin you bring back two or three witnesses so that his unrepentant heart can be confirmed until that has happened don't even hear it.
[time=1937] Don't even listen to it. So in a sense he's saying there should be no witch hunts in the church against the elders there should be no lynch parties or lynch mobs or tar and feathering experiences there should never be wild rumors running through a church about a particular individual and finding a following of that in the church without ever having known the facts.
[time=1958] But at the same time this is a verse of incredible accountability for the leader because he is subject to the same process of Matthew 18 as everybody else.
[time=1968] If a secretary happened to have been working in a particular area of the church and she were to have questions based on what she sees there that one of the guys on staff has been pilfering funds from the church.
[time=1983] Let's see her obligation and duty to go to that pastor in private and say I'm confused from what I see here I see your this seems to say you're involved in stealing from the church.
[time=1999] I see your repents at that point obviously true repentance he would immediately go to those he is accountable to whether on the staff or the elder board and say I've sinned I repent of that and then that elder board would sit and decide whether or not that man is disqualified from ministry or should stay on in the ministry.
[time=2017] The first line of attack is the individual going to the individual irregardless of title or position and that really is the best way to respect any particular leader that might be in view because then he has the privilege of repenting before the thing gets completely out of control before it looks as if he only repented because he was forced to repent.
[time=2039] You've ever been involved with leaders who have fallen what you look for and generally with anybody who's fallen and sent as you look for a soft heartedness to repent without somebody having to wrench their arm into repentance.
[time=2051] And so these men elders are both the beneficiary and accountable to the normal Matthew 18 process.
[time=2064] No witch hunts no lynch mobs but no pedestals until you get to verse 20.
[time=2072] It's the same process as for everybody else until you get to verse 20 look at it.
[time=2078] Those who continue in sin namely those elders who continue in sin those elders who have been approached by one and then by two or three witnesses as Matthew 18 would dictate.
[time=2089] Those guys that have been treated that way with a heart of restoration calling them to repentance but they don't repent and they continue in sin you treat them this way verse 20 rebuke them in the presence of all.
[time=2101] Rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning.
[time=2110] The word of God calls the people of God to publicly and openly rebuke an elder who has fallen into sin and who refuses to repent of his sinfulness.
[time=2127] That is what is called for the word their rebuke is the same word that we saw over in Matthew chapter 18 which meant to turn the light on their sin expose their sin explain their sin and tell it is obvious.
[time=2141] And there are several reasons for that one is stated one is not stated.
[time=2146] Leadership implies influence leadership implies a following leadership if you're not a leader unless people are following you.
[time=2152] And what happens is men get into leadership and people follow them and then they fall into sin and the following deserves the right to know what in the world happened.
[time=2164] And if the man has been teaching false doctrine he either corrects them out of his own repentant heart and says that the people I was wrong and if he refuses to repent that his doctrine was erroneous he is rebuke in the presence of all.
[time=2177] The other men who know the truth stand in his stead and say he was teaching you this and this is why it's wrong. This is how it leads you astray. This is the error of his way.
[time=2187] The following of these people is in view and if it's not been a teaching error if it's been a lifestyle error and he refuses to repent and belligerently goes on and tries to say my way of life is legitimate my sin is really okay.
[time=2200] The people who follow him deserve to hear the other men say it's not okay and this is not what this is what's not okay about it and this is where the word of God says it's not okay.
[time=2210] So in other words there is a huge responsibility that comes with being a leader and it implies people following and those who are following when a man is fallen in his sin and refuses to repent deserve to hear the truth about either his doctrine or his lifestyle and so he is rebuke publicly.
[time=2226] He is rebuke in the presence of all verse 20 says and the second reason is stated there look at the end of the verse so that the rest also may be fearful of sinning you say who are the rest.
[time=2237] Well when that construction is used in the Greek it means the rest of everybody who is in that basic category the rest of that category the category is elders.
[time=2246] So what he is saying is the rest of the elders may also be fearful of sinning.
[time=2251] When a man moves into leadership falls into sin refuses to repent he is rebuke in the presence of all so that the rest of the elders may also be fearful of the same treatment should they choose that course.
[time=2264] I will never forget the day at church when one of the young men who was in the ministry so to speak he wasn't ordained yet he wasn't in full time ministry but he had been given significant ministry responsibilities he was overseeing a large portion of the junior high ministry.
[time=2283] This is not when I was pastor this is before I was pastor of that ministry and that that man we we call them a minister a deacon of sorts that was our terminology had fallen into immorality and I'll never forget the day that evening service some 3000 people there when he made his way up to the pulpit and publicly confessed his sin and sought the forgiveness of the people who had entrusted to him that ministry.
[time=2312] And particularly said to the parents of all those kids who they had earlier said to him we trust you you teach the kids the word of God you teach our kids how to live you take them on all the trips you build a staff that influences their life for the cause of Christ we trust you.
[time=2330] And he had to come back to them and say I have failed I had to trade your trust and this is what I did and I repent. Let me tell you what that puts the fear of God in everybody else on staff you say I thought we were supposed to obey God out of love that's right that's the ultimate motive of obedience but God over and over in the New Testament induces the notion of obeying him for fear's sake because there are consequences to sin both come together as motives in the New Testament.
[time=2359] New Testament obviously love being the preeminent motive so it is to work to shore up any inclination of the other men the rest of them the other elders who may be interested in in falling into sin be aware of this that should you do that you will be rebuked in the presence of all.
[time=2380] It's interesting to look at this illustrated in the life of Christ Christ is sitting there one day and they bring to him a woman who had just been taken in the act of adultery.
[time=2393] There are no words of judgment there are no words of condemnation there is no rebuke there is instead an illustration he says they don't pick up the first stone to kill you neither do I go your way and sin no more.
[time=2407] It's interesting to look at Jesus with Zacchaeus a tax collector one who had been a traitor to the nation of God and fell into the hands of the Roman government and extorted the people of their money he was a thief he was a robber.
[time=2421] Jesus had no words of condemnation for him only words of grace and love.
[time=2425] Even the rich young ruler in Luke chapter 18 you may want to read that incident he was a man of fabulous wealth and he came to Christ saying what the I need to do to inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2436] And Jesus said keep the ten commandments and he said I've done that he was very proud man didn't think he'd ever violated a law of God in his life.
[time=2444] So Jesus knowing his heart said well then sell your possessions give them the poor and follow me the Bible said his heart was very sad for he had much wealth and he left.
[time=2453] In other words the man didn't want to follow Jesus if it meant giving up all of his money.
[time=2457] Even to that man Jesus had no harsh words.
[time=2462] Jesus didn't condemn him as he walked away and said well then you'll be in hell or you're a sinner or you love your money too much to get none of that just compassion.
[time=2474] You want to know who Jesus saved his words of rebuke for leaders and only leaders Jesus rebuked the leaders and he did it publicly and he did it without apology.
[time=2488] Matthew 23 I'll just grab a few portions of it here.
[time=2491] Jesus is cursing the scribes and the Pharisees he says whoa to you which is another way to say damn you or curse you.
[time=2499] Whoa do you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men.
[time=2504] See that's the main problem leaders get up and hold themselves in positions of leadership and then everybody who follows them goes down the same path and their path is going to hell.
[time=2514] Whoa do you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men.
[time=2519] Whoa do you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you devour widows houses.
[time=2523] Whoa do you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyt and when he becomes one you make him twice as much as son of hell as yourselves.
[time=2534] Talk about rebuke.
[time=2536] Whoa do you blind guides who say whoever swears by the temple.
[time=2542] Whoa do you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites for you tithe mint and dill and cumin and have neglected the way to your provisions of the law.
[time=2548] Whoa do you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites for you clean the outside of the cup of the dish but inside you are full of robbery and self indulgence.
[time=2557] He is just going through a list of seven or eight curses that nails them to the wall what they do what their motives are what their strategies are and he does it publicly in front of everybody and he says to all who follow if you follow them you follow them to hell because he loves the sheep.
[time=2575] He loves the leader too but the leader doesn't want to turn the leader is hard hard the leader is continuing in sin and so the so the Lord Jesus rebukes them publicly.
[time=2586] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2590] Paul did the same thing.
[time=2593] Look at 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 20.
[time=2598] Paul did the exact same thing.
[time=2603] He names these people among these chapter 1 verse 20 among these are Hymanes and Alexander who might have delivered over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme who are Hymanes and Alexander look at the end of verse 19 they are men who have suffered shipwreck in regard to their faith.
[time=2625] These are some of the men that Paul is fighting against some of these savage wolves some of these ungodly men who Paul had undoubtedly had personal interaction with and they refused to repent they went on in their course of behavior and finally he just names them publicly and rebukes them as those who have suffered shipwreck their faith.
[time=2646] So there's no confusion about what this verse is saying it's just hard to apply it's terrifying it's frightening if you get a situation like this and you think about rebuking an elder in front of everybody you say to yourself my lands are you sure I mean what about his wife she didn't do it any wrong she's the innocent party in this and think of the embarrassment that you bring upon her and what about his kids what kind of lasting damage will that leave in their hearts and minds against the cause of Christ.
[time=2675] Will they harbor bitterness and what about just publicly opening up I mean rebuked that means put the light on what are we going to put the flood lights on a scandal in our church and everybody will see it I mean shouldn't we be just a little more quiet about this issue and worst yet what happens if he files a lawsuit against us.
[time=2695] Read verse 21 first Timothy chapter 5 verse 21.
[time=2707] In case you're thinking those thoughts I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus of his end of his chosen angels to maintain these principles without bias doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.
[time=2724] In other words, I don't care how close you happen to have been to that guy or how much you may have disliked Jesus Christ and his chosen angels to do this to maintain these principles without bias doing nothing in a spirit of partiality.
[time=2748] In other words, I don't care how close you happen to have been to that guy or how much you may have disliked him whether he was one of your own or whether he was one of the pastors you disliked without bias without partiality apply the principles of this text to his life and in so doing preserve the holiness of the church of God and speak out against the sinfulness of sin.
[time=2777] So how do you restore and maintain Godly leadership in a church? One you do it by honoring the Godly elders give them respect and pay them if need be so that they can continue their ministry.
[time=2790] Two protect your Godly elders turn a deaf ear to unsubstantiated criticism and support them and also protect them with the knowledge that if they are in sin you're going to pursue them according to Matthew 18.
[time=2805] Number three, rebuke the ungodly elder the one who continues in sin the one who is hardhearted and refuses to turn from either his parent doctrine or his parent lifestyle for those turn the light on turn the spotlight on his either his doctrine or his behavior in the presence of all so that the rest the remaining elders may be fearful of sinning.
[time=2831] You think, man, it's tough. I don't want to do that. Well, I pragmatic, pragmatic questions, good questions, genuinely good question. I don't know if we should do that.
[time=2840] Verse 21, you don't have a choice. I charge you in the presence of God Christ and his holy angels, maintain these principles.
[time=2849] So now there's just this last point. The last thing he says is take great care in selecting elders, selecting future elders.
[time=2857] Honor the godly elders, protect the godly elders, rebuke the ungodly elders and select carefully the future elders.
[time=2864] Verse 22, "Do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily and thus share responsibility for the sins of others, keep yourself free from sin."
[time=2874] He's saying this to Timothy and he's saying this to the elders at Ephesus. If you look through the New Testament you'll find that the ordaining people of the New Testament, those who would lay hands and that's a picture coming out of the Old Testament.
[time=2886] When a person would sacrifice an animal, they would lay their hands on the animal to say this animal is going to die my death.
[time=2892] There is identification here. I should be dying. This is a sacrifice for me.
[time=2897] And when a church ordains someone into ministry, they do that by laying hands on them.
[time=2903] You can look back just a few verses in chapter 4 verse 14, "Do not neglect the spiritual gift within you which was bestowed upon you through prophetic utterance with the laying on of hands by the Presbyteria."
[time=2915] That laying on of hands of the Presbyteria is a formal commissioning into ministry.
[time=2920] And what he is saying is, "Don't do that quickly. Don't do that hastily. Don't do that based upon a man's heart for the Lord."
[time=2929] You know, some guys can just absolutely just evidence such a soft, gentle, sweet, sensitive heart for God and for the Lord and for evangelism and for worship.
[time=2941] You'll just feel the soft and tender heart. Don't do it based on that.
[time=2946] Don't do it based on his words. Some people are really good at talking Christian talk and talking faithfulness and talking vision and talking leadership. Don't do it on that.
[time=2956] Don't do it based on his devotional life.
[time=2959] I remember a man often would repeat to me, "Well, my wife and I this morning we were praying for so and so."
[time=2967] And the first time I thought, "Man, that's kind of neat. He and his wife get up. They have their Bible sitting there praying together." But when I heard it about the hundredth time in a year's span, I started to wonder what was so important to him about telling me that he and his wife were having their devotional life.
[time=2981] Later found out he was unqualified for ministry and no longer holds that position. Don't listen to his words about his devotional life or his heart or his empathy for the lost or his desire to do a particular work.
[time=2996] Look instead. Don't be hasty. Look instead. Look at verse 24 and 25. Look at his deeds. Look at his deeds.
[time=3003] The sins of some men are quite evident going before them to judgment.
[time=3007] For others, their sins follow after. In other words, if you look at their deeds just closely and off, you'll notice immediately that some don't qualify at all.
[time=3017] Some, however, will have sins that follow after them. You'll have to look a little longer and you'll have to investigate a little more closely.
[time=3024] But you'll see it. Most times you'll see it. Verse 25, likewise, also deeds that are good are quite evident.
[time=3033] And those which are otherwise cannot be concealed. What he's saying is, "Base your selection of elders into the pastrid or into the ministry."
[time=3041] Not only according to chapter 3 and the qualifications given there, but based upon his ministry. All the time at the college, young men would come in as freshmen.
[time=3050] And they'd want to be involved as leaders in the dorm or leaders on the mission strips or leaders on this team or that team.
[time=3055] And they'd come to me and they'd just be able to wax eloquent with this incredible desire to be involved and to have a position of leadership and be involved in all these things.
[time=3064] We would always just say one thing. Who are you ministering to right now? Who do I talk to about you?
[time=3072] Where are the people that you have minister? Whether they be here at college or whether they be here at your home church or in your youth group.
[time=3078] And when there were no such people to talk to, there was no position of leadership. Instead, we said, "Serve, find a ministry, make your own, do whatever you have to do, set up chairs, take the chairs down, clean up the papers off the floor after chapel.
[time=3090] Do whatever you've got to do to evidence over some period of time, good deeds, appropriate deeds."
[time=3098] And so really, when a person is put into leadership, when a person is laying hands, when a group of men lay hands on another man, they're not making him an elder. They're just confirming that he already is one.
[time=3107] They're just saying he already evidences the character. He already has the ministry in place. We just recognize that ministry in his life.
[time=3115] That's the basic principle. Don't put men in leadership who have not first proven themselves, even behind the scenes, in some type of tangible ministry that can then be examined for its holiness or the lack thereof.
[time=3128] Don't be hasty.
[time=3131] Now, we'll just add a minute here. They throw a footnote in in verse 23.
[time=3136] As he jumps down from do not lay hands in verse 22 to hastily on anyone, and thus share responsibility for the sins of others, keep yourself free from sin.
[time=3145] Now, verse 23 is almost like when you write a letter, you know how you'll put a parenthesis, and you just throw a little thought in there. That's what this is.
[time=3151] No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.
[time=3158] Now, either Timothy was being kind of corralled into not using a little bit of wine for his stomach's sake, because that was being considered sin by that culture, or he was just forgetting to do that.
[time=3171] Timothy, as we study the books of first and second Timothy, had a rather weak composition. He was often given to falling into sickness and being physically weak.
[time=3180] The water of his day was very polluted and stagnant, and as a result, people of weak composition would easily fall sick to the germs in that water.
[time=3190] Now, what Paul is saying here is feel free to take a little wine from medicinal purposes.
[time=3195] In the same way that you and I will go to the doctor and we'll have some ailment. He will prescribe a drug for us, I mean a drug of some sort.
[time=3203] And if you're in pain, it will be, we'll call it a nice drug. A drug that makes you feel like the bad drugs do.
[time=3210] You take that stuff, and you have no qualms about that, because it has medicinal value and medicinal purpose. There's nothing sinful about that.
[time=3218] So this is not an endorsement to drink. This is instead, in the same way that some would take a little bit of nightquil on a night when they can't fall asleep, because their head is congested and the throat is killing him, and there is a little bit of alcohol in that nightquil.
[time=3231] They take that from medicinal purposes. That's all this is saying. That's what he's encouraging Timothy to do.
[time=3241] Godly leadership. Godly leadership in the church is a priority, and that is where Paul is giving his emphasis to try to save these churches in and around the city of Ephesus.
[time=3254] And as we complete this little study that kind of turned into a series on church discipline, it just reveals so remarkably the heart of God.
[time=3263] As you think back to Galatians 6-6 and restoring a brother, viewing him as one who had a broken leg and you're mending his leg for fitness and usefulness, the net had been torn and you minned the net.
[time=3275] That sin is not something we jump on each other because we want to make fun of each other or beat each other down or say I'm better than you or help somebody wallow in the misery of their failure.
[time=3284] It is instead a great call to those who care to mend the person back to a place of usefulness for the cause of Christ, to do it in the spirit of humility and gentleness as it says in Galatians 6.
[time=3295] He didn't want to go to Matthew 18 and said, "Well, what happens when I go to my brother and he doesn't want to be fixed? He doesn't want to be restored. He's got a hard heart, an unrepentant heart."
[time=3305] And Jesus himself lays out the formula to put that pressure, to twist his spiritual arm into his best interest, which is his repentance and restoration to God.
[time=3316] And then we come to a passage such as this in 1 Timothy 5, which says, "Even the elders of the church ought to be held accountable."
[time=3325] And some, even a very public way because God is a holy God and He wants a holy church.
[time=3331] Because sin is destructive and it tears people's lives apart and as a result, the church cannot tolerate sin.
[time=3342] And what God wants is restoration, but God wants our people's lives put back together.
[time=3347] And I praise God that He's that kind of a God.
[time=3352] When I was over in Asia, I stopped it.
[time=3372] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
