[time=0] Do you realize that most Americans don't like their jobs?
[time=4] In fact, a recent survey indicated that over 50% said they would rather have chosen a
[time=10] completely different line of work than the one they're in, and they would change if they could, but they feel trapped because of the salary they're making and their reputation.
[time=21] Oftentimes, people think the solution to that is to change jobs or even change careers, but the word of God may indicate differently.
[time=28] We'll find today about the Christian work ethic and how Christians can be used by God to bring glory to him in the place that they work.
[time=43] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study and music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=53] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=55] Thank you for joining us.
[time=58] A recent Gallup poll indicates that most Americans are dissatisfied with their jobs.
[time=62] A well-known career management consultant firm confirms that more than one half of all Americans would choose a different line of work if they could start again.
[time=71] However, most can't afford to change and hence, they feel trapped in their jobs.
[time=76] Christians are not immune to those feelings.
[time=79] Stay tuned as Pastor Moore explores the biblical work ethic and how it can bring meaning and purpose to your job in a message he has entitled "Christians in the Workplace."
[time=90] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of First Timothy, when we'll be looking at chapter 6, verses 1 and 2.
[time=100] Our special music today will be provided by Keith and Starr Broticum.
[time=105] As we begin our service today, let's join with the congregation as they participate in a responsive reading entitled "Justification Through Faith."
[time=116] Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=134] And not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations knowing that tribulation brings
[time=140] about perseverance.
[time=148] And hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.
[time=164] For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man someone would even dare to die.
[time=180] Much more than, having now been justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him.
[time=201] And not only this, but we also exalt in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
[time=225] We thank God for the reading of the Word.
[time=227] You may be seated and we'll continue as we sing the song.
[time=230] Heaven came down and glory filled my soul, 495.
[time=235] This is the testimony of the believer that has accepted Christ as their Savior.
[time=239] 495 will sing verses 1 and 3.
[time=382] Thank you again for your good singing.
[time=384] We continue with music now as we listen to Keith and star Bronnigam.
[time=388] Let's open our hearts to the message they have for us.
[time=393] [MUSIC]
[time=403] There is a fountain filled with blood.
[time=412] Drawed from in endless rains.
[time=419] And seeners plunged beneath that flood.
[time=426] Drawed from in endless rains.
[time=448] And seeners plunged beneath that flood.
[time=464] The dying fifth rejoice to sing that fountain in his day.
[time=482] And there may hide the violence he washed all my sins away.
[time=529] There seems my faith by soul and blood by precious wounds of life.
[time=542] Breathing of has been my theme and shall be till I die.
[time=584] Breathing of.
[time=599] Well thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=602] Also we were just talking before we went on the insert about the number of people in our church that really have needed the prayers of our body of believers for various reasons.
[time=611] In most cases is some serious illnesses.
[time=613] Well we've had some operations.
[time=615] We've had some people diagnosed with cancer and beyond that even in our own church family.
[time=620] A lot of people from the Bible Hour have been writing and sharing their concerns.
[time=624] And we thought we'd just take a minute with you this morning and pray that God would give you grace as you're struggling.
[time=629] So would you pray with me for just a minute?
[time=631] Father we want to lift up the people both in our church and in the Christian community as we are together in this ministry.
[time=639] People who have gone through serious operations are sick in some significant way, even those who have been diagnosed with cancer or struggling.
[time=649] And Father we ask you to give these people and their families real grace and strength as they fight their way through a very difficult trial.
[time=657] Give them a special sense of your presence and encouragement and help those around them to encourage them through loving and tangible ways.
[time=664] We pray these things in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=667] Thank you Russ and we want to encourage those of you that are watching us by way of television that every Wednesday morning.
[time=674] We look over those letters that come in especially those that have prayer requests and march and ed and I sit and pray for those requests asking God to intervene in your life.
[time=684] So we encourage you to write to us and tell us of your needs so that we can pray intelligently for you.
[time=690] Let me tell you again about some events that are taking place.
[time=692] We continue to go with our celebration on Wednesday evenings, our summer celebration.
[time=698] We will be having John Davis with us. I hope that you'll join with us on August 12th. He'll be here at 7 p.m. on Wednesday evening at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=708] Join us for an evening of inspiration in the middle of the week.
[time=712] And then if you like brass, I know of no finer group than the King's brass. It'll be with us here at Black Hawk Baptist Church on August 16th.
[time=721] That's a Sunday evening. They'll be here at 6 p.m. I hope that you'll join with us and be here that night to hear their inspiring music.
[time=731] And then we look ahead to August 30th on a Sunday morning. We'll have Dan and Donna Oxley.
[time=738] Dan is an outstanding trumpet player and Donna his wife is a fine soloist. They'll be here with inspiring music.
[time=746] Dan and Donna traveled with the young Messiah tour last year and just again another outstanding team of musicians.
[time=754] We want to encourage you to join with us and there are other events coming up.
[time=758] Then of course September 13th we've got Bring a Friend Sunday which will be a very special Sunday for us.
[time=763] It's kind of a back in the saddle Sunday bringing everybody back from all the summer activities and bringing friends with them.
[time=769] And of course we give a special invitation to any of those of you who would like to come and visit us on that day.
[time=775] And we'll be having Stephen Maria Gardner with us. They are former members of our church live in Colorado now but always great to have them back along with Mandy.
[time=784] And we'll be telling you more about that. It's exciting Sunday on September 13th. Hope you can come and join with us.
[time=791] Now just before we go back to some good music at the message from our pastor I want to remind you about the book that we're offering it's entitled How to Grow a Happy Family.
[time=800] A great booklet that is a guide to just giving you some suggestions on how you can lead your children and the things of the Lord.
[time=807] And I hope that you'll take time to write for this book How to Grow a Happy Family. You can receive it by writing to the Bible a horror.
[time=814] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=820] You could write for it and just ask for it if you could send a donation. We'd appreciate that very much. Again the book is How to Grow a Happy Family.
[time=829] An exciting book for young married couples who are beginning to rear their children.
[time=834] We're going to go back to the live portion of our service as I mentioned. We're delighted to have Keith and Star Brattingham with us this week.
[time=842] And they're going to minister to us in song now and then we'll have our message from Russell Moore. I hope you'll stay tuned for the entire broadcast.
[time=873] Why should I feel desperate? Why should the shadows come? Why should my heart be lonely and long for heaven and home?
[time=899] When Jesus is my portion, my constant friend is here for his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me.
[time=928] With eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me.
[time=943] I sing because I'm happy.
[time=957] For his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me.
[time=975] Let not more heart be troubled. His tender word I hear and resting in his goodness.
[time=994] I lose all doubt and fear. For by the happy leader, but just one step, I may see.
[time=1014] For his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me.
[time=1044] I sing because I'm happy and I sing because I'm free for his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me.
[time=1073] When ever I am tempted, when ever put the rise when song gives way to sigh.
[time=1097] When hope within me dies, I draw the closer to him from a care he sets me free.
[time=1117] For his eyes on the sparrow and I know he cares for me.
[time=1148] I sing because I'm happy.
[time=1162] For his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me.
[time=1192] Amen, the wonderful truth of Matthew 7, where the Lord and the Sermon of the Mount said, consider the birds of the air.
[time=1212] I want to begin by asking you a few diagnostic questions that come from a job satisfaction survey.
[time=1232] Question number 1, do you look forward to going to work?
[time=1242] Question number 2, do you find your work assignments appealing to you?
[time=1252] Question number 3, do you find your relationship with your boss satisfying?
[time=1262] Question number 4, are you satisfied with the financial reward you receive?
[time=1292] Question number 3, do you find your relationship with your boss satisfying?
[time=1352] If you ask a career management consultant, one I read, Richard Gurman, he says, number 1, it's absolutely essential that you like your job because if you don't like your job you will inevitably fail.
[time=1366] And then offers all kinds of techniques to help the employee manage his environment or her environment so they can get from it what they need.
[time=1378] And the question that we ask this morning is, how should Christians approach the workplace?
[time=1384] How is the believer to approach the workplace?
[time=1388] What does the Christian work ethic define for the believer?
[time=1392] And what is the motive inside the heart of the believer as he gets up on Monday morning or she gets up on Monday morning and goes to work?
[time=1400] Well, a beginning of an answer to these kinds of questions is found in our text this morning, if you have your Bible, why don't you take it and open to 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[time=1410] 1 Timothy chapter 6, and we'll look at just the first two verses of this new chapter.
[time=1418] And in it we begin to uncover and discover and really I think remind ourselves of the Christian work ethic as it is taught to us in the word of God.
[time=1431] Verses 1 and 2, let me read them and you follow along. 1 Timothy chapter 6, verses 1 and 2, let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honors so that the name of God and our doctrine may not be spoken against.
[time=1448] Verse 2, and let those who have believers as their masters not be disrespectful to them because they are brethren but let them serve them all the more because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved teach and preach these principles.
[time=1463] It's a very simple passage. It talks to believers about the workplace and in verse 1 it talks to the believer who has an unbelieving or an unsaved boss.
[time=1473] And verse 2, it talks to the Christian who has a believing boss or a saved boss. So whichever category you fall into this morning as you think about your employment, you will either find you have an unsaved employer or a saved employer and the word of God would speak to both groups.
[time=1491] Under each group Paul describes the method of working and then the motive, the method and the motive. Now immediately when you come to a text like this you are struck by the very strong terms used in master and slave and you kind of wonder what does this have to do with me.
[time=1510] I am neither a master nor a slave. The word for slave here in the Greek is do lost. It's the strongest possible term describing a servant or a slave that highlights the notion of submission and subjection on a long term basis. This is really the word for slave as it is properly translated in your text.
[time=1528] The word for master is despotess from which we get our word despot and it talks about the authoritarian master sometimes unrestrained and unrestricted. And the backdrop of this passage is a Roman Empire and they estimate about half of the population of the Roman Empire composed of slaves.
[time=1548] So there is a ready readership. There are people in this church who are slaves and there are people in this church who are masters. And it really is the slave master relationship. That is the economic structure or the fabric of the Middle East and the Roman world and the New Testament culture.
[time=1566] It was the basis on which they functioned economically. Now people would be caught or brought into slavery through several different avenues just briefly. One they would be caught as captives of some great conquest and then brought into slavery to the conquering nation.
[time=1583] Others would be forced into slavery because they had committed some crime and that would be a part of their condemnation that would be a part of their punishment to become slaves. Others, and related to the other, would be they were found in debt and could not pay off their debt and rather than going chapter 11 or chapter 7, they were themselves brought into slavery to pay that debt and oftentimes their children with them.
[time=1605] Sometimes you would find yourself in slavery because you had been kidnapped. You were a free person, you had been kidnapped and then sold to a foreign person or in a foreign land. It is interesting to note that Exodus 21 and Deuteronomy 24 both say that there is a death penalty in the nation of Israel to anyone who kidnaps a free person and sells them into slavery.
[time=1625] And then sometimes this sounds very striking to us as we have vivid images in our minds of the slavery pre-civil war and during the Civil War. Sometimes people would sell themselves into slavery. Sometimes people would sell themselves into slavery. Sometimes for a period of time, sometimes for their entire life.
[time=1644] So those are the basic ways in which people would find their way into a slave master relationship. Now there were abuses, gross abuses, abuses that would parallel and be comparable to the South in our nation's history.
[time=1660] Roman law provided for such abuses. It was permissible for a master who owned a slave to subject that slave to enormously cruel hard labor to chain his slave or her slave to severely beat or lash or whip the slave to brand the slave and under certain circumstances even to crucify the slave.
[time=1682] They were viewed like animals, human tools, tools in the hands of humans. As noted in verse 1, you'll see the phrase under the yoke. Animals went under the yoke. And so here in this text Paul leaves room for even the harshest kind of slavery where people are treated as human tools.
[time=1703] And in that way, much basically from the 3rd to the 1st century BC, people were treated in that horrifying, degrading and often racially discriminating picture of slavery which we have in our mind of the South before the Civil War and for which we are thankful no longer is happening in our country today.
[time=1724] And I believe that slavery was ultimately abolished in America as a result of the transformation of the gospel as it had its impact on the hearts of men and women and saw this kind of slavery for what it was and rose up and stood against it.
[time=1737] In the time that this text is written, there is a good chance that while there were abuses, the basic tenor of slavery in this day and age was not that kind of abusive reality. In fact, we're best to strip that picture from our minds as we approach a text such as this.
[time=1754] Historians tell us, in fact Frank Tinney in his book, "Economic Survey of Ancient Room." Tell us there was a great freedom movement just prior and during the time of Christ.
[time=1764] For example, between 81 and 49 BC, it's reported that there were released in the city of Rome in that 30-year period, a number as large as 500,000 slaves, they were just turned free.
[time=1778] And that's staggering thought when you realize that the population of Rome then was only about 870,000 people.
[time=1785] So this huge amount of slaves were being released, it was all a part of a humanitarian movement that gave freedom to slaves.
[time=1793] Further, in 46 to 44 BC, Caesar was said to have sent out some 80,000 poor people and slaves to help colonize the rest of the Roman Empire, that all a part of that freedom movement.
[time=1806] In the land of Palestine, and this is helpful background for us as Paul, of course, would have been familiar with these rules, laws, and regulations. In the land of Palestine, at this particular era, the community of people was basically divided into people who owned business and land and those who were slaves to those people.
[time=1823] There are some instances, for example, Matthew 20 of the day laborer who is hired for a certain amount of money, but by and large labor was conducted on a slave master relationship. That was the economic fabric of that day.
[time=1838] Jack and Ias Jeremiah wrote a book called Jerusalem at the time of Christ, and he describes the conditions of Jewish slaves held by their Jewish masters.
[time=1847] Jewish slave was never asked to do the most dishonoring task out of washing the feet, and you remember that was a common practice in that day and age.
[time=1856] People wore sandals, they walked on dirty, dusty roads, and when they would come to a person's house, it was polite and typical and average and normal to have those feet washed.
[time=1865] But law required that that could not be done by the domestic, the slave that was in the home. It was too demeaning. It was beneath him. It should have been done as an act of service in love by the host, which was often the case.
[time=1877] By law, the domestic or the slave was equal to the oldest son in the family, and he had a right to the same treatment as the master's family or his eldest son.
[time=1886] He had a right to good food, good clothes, a good place at the table, a bed, a place to sleep, oftentimes they would sleep on the top floor of the house.
[time=1898] The slave was able to acquire possessions, to buy things, to find things, to keep things. He could even shorten his stay by earning money and paying his master and thereby shortening the contract stay.
[time=1912] If he chose to marry, his master had to take care of his wife and any children they would have, and that would include the clothing and the food and the shelter implied there.
[time=1922] The six-year rule prevailed, and the Old Testament, the basic standard by which a Hebrew would be enslaved to another Hebrew, was for a period of six years. That was still in effect.
[time=1933] And the slave was allowed to leave for a better opportunity at the end of that six years.
[time=1940] In fact, Jewish slaves were so well treated and protected by Jewish law, there was an old saying that went this way, quote, "Whoever buys a Jewish slave buys himself a master."
[time=1950] They were remarkably protected by laws. They were treated well, the average slave costs some 2,000 times, the daily wage, and when you would contract a slave to come and be your domestic, you had to pay him all 2,000 dinarii up front at the beginning of his time of service.
[time=1969] Now, in the Roman world, the Greco-Roman world, the world of the city of Ephesus, it was also very much the same way. In fact, many people preferred slavery over freedom, preferred slavery over being a day wager under these kinds of conditions.
[time=1986] In fact, Tenney Frank observes through his historical study that oftentimes the domestic slave would make better money than would a free person, a day wage earner.
[time=2000] He calculated the amount of money that a day wage earner would make, and how many days he could work in a year and total all that up, and then subtracted out all of his regular expenses, and determined that he would have, basically, approximately 35 dinarii,
[time=2013] have expendable income at the end of every year after he was done clothing himself, and eating, and shelter, and all the rest.
[time=2020] A slave, on the other hand, would have all of his food taken care of, all of his housing, all of his clothing, and would also be given 60 dinarii a year.
[time=2028] So he basically had twice as much money to spend at the end of every year. In addition to that, as we've noted, if the slave had a family, then the master had to care for all the clothes, the food, and the lodging of the family.
[time=2039] So you can see much different than our image of the south and the atrocities that happened there. This was a relatively workable economic financial structure in which masters and slaves would mutually contract into these kinds of relationships, and it was considered mutually beneficial.
[time=2057] Both kinds of relationships, the abusive and the cooperating relationships of slave and master are in view in the background of this text, Paul speaks to both groups.
[time=2070] It's interesting to note that nowhere in the Old Testament or the New Testament is there a command ever to a slave, excuse me, to a master to release his slave. There is no such command anywhere in Scripture.
[time=2081] There's also no such command anywhere in Scripture that a slave should be set free. Now again, when it is racially biased and degrading the human rights as we've had in our own country, where thankfully rid of that kind of system, but the focus of this text and the focus of Scripture is regardless of which structure you're in.
[time=2102] If you have a free economy and you are employer, employee relationship, much like they had under different terms at periods of Old Testament history, or whether you're being abused in a very abusive situation as a true slave under a master, the emphasis in the word of God is not on changing the structure, it's on changing the heart involved in the structure, and that's what you'll find here in this text.
[time=2126] So let's begin in verse 1. And this is the direction that is given to a saved person who works for an unsaved boss, whether abusive or whether more like the kind we would have even today. Let's read it again.
[time=2140] Let all who are under the yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine may not be spoken against.
[time=2151] The method of working, the method of responding is the word honor, and that should characterize the attitude and the demeanor of a believer towards his unsaved boss.
[time=2162] It's the same word in chapter 5 verse 3 where it says to honor widows, it's the same word in chapter 5 verse 17 where it says give double honor to elders, it's the same word in Ephesians where it says in chapter 6 to honor your mother and your father, it is a word of deep respect for the person and the position.
[time=2180] That's how we're supposed to view our unsaved boss. There is a very popular thing that goes on inside of workplaces, secular workplaces particularly where they involve themselves in the past time of boss bashing.
[time=2196] A Confederacy of employees who take great delight in belittling and berating their employer, they find flaws in personality, they find flaws in attitude, they find flaws in their way of doing things and their greatest delight and the energy of their day is to highlight these failures and these shortcomings of those who they work for.
[time=2215] It's very common, you may be involved in it or you may be involved in an office where that happens.
[time=2220] That can compound itself when they are believers who have a tendency even to look down on this unregenerate pagan that I work for who has not come to the knowledge of the truth, who doesn't know Christ, who is bound for hell and who for all I know is worthy of it.
[time=2235] That kind of attitude is sometimes very prevalent in a believer's mind towards an unbeliever who they don't like, who they have to work for.
[time=2243] It's a superior already attitude, an intolerant beligerent attitude towards those who employ them.
[time=2250] Nowhere in the Scripture is that merited or called for. Instead it is nothing but honor. Hold them in the highest regard.
[time=2257] The word regard there is an objective assessment. It doesn't talk about how you personally feel about this person. He is held in a position of honor because he is your employer, treat him that way.
[time=2267] Respect authority. I remember learning this lesson in a very painful way in my own home. I remember my math teacher in the sixth grade and he was in my opinion and in many of my classmate's opinion, odious in the sight of God and man.
[time=2285] He was despicable. He was horrible. His appearance was leaving much to be desired. His attitude was worse. He shouldn't have been teaching, I believe, with all my heart.
[time=2294] But he was and just because of those facts I felt that my personal commissioning to be as difficult and traumatic on his life as possible, which I did rather successfully.
[time=2306] Until my parents found that about it at which time I was severely beaten for my insubordination and when I complained about this individual and his attitude and his demeanor and the way everybody else felt about them, they said what you would say to your kids, it doesn't matter how you feel about this individual.
[time=2322] He is your teacher. He is in a position of respect and you will respect him. Earlier in my life, I had gone to a private Christian school and my parents were so committed to my understanding the place of authority in my life that they said if you ever get spanked at school, you'll get spanked when you get home because we want to punctuate what they just did.
[time=2339] We want to make no mistake that they are right and you are wrong and you will follow. So that's the spirit. That's the attitude. There is no berating or belittling or degrading or defaming or in any way tearing down those we work for. They may be jerks. They may deserve such, but that is not the point.
[time=2359] As regenerates, we will treat them with honor and respect. Now this whole matter is striking right at the heart of America. People in America have a very low level of job satisfaction.
[time=2376] I believe it's because people are working for money. People are working for money and we in the church are guilty of the same thing.
[time=2384] We find our motive to go to work so that we can work for money, to earn money so that we can buy things. And while these things that we buy have some temporary sense of gratification, we all know that they wear out and they break and the glitter goes away, things are not a substantial enough reason to be involved in work and then find real gratification in work.
[time=2404] Even if you are making an enormous amount of money, you better than maybe the rest of us can tell us that even with all the money in the world you can't buy enough satisfaction. There is another reason to work.
[time=2415] America has fallen into the trap and they have lost the intrinsic value of work itself and they have lost a higher motive for their work.
[time=2422] They have been reduced and voluntarily reduced themselves to working for things and money and vacations and they work so they can stop working, they live for the weekend or they live for the holiday or they live for retirement and the work itself is an obstacle that must be overcome in order to get to those ends.
[time=2438] That is not a Christian work ethic. That is a worldly work ethic and it produces a low level of job satisfaction.
[time=2446] There is, instead, an intrinsic value to be found in work and it is revealed in this passage, the highest motive possible for any work, whether you are involved as an accountant or an engineer or whether you are a carpenter, whatever you are, the highest motive of work is found right here in this verse.
[time=2464] Look at it at the end of verse 1. We are to regard our own masters as worthy of all honors so that in order that the name of God and our doctrine may not be spoken against.
[time=2478] There it is. That is why we should be getting up to go to work in the morning. That is what should drive us. That should be the compelling motive of our heart.
[time=2485] We want to honor the name of God and the doctrine of God. We want to adorn the truth by our behavior in the workplace such that people speak well and understand well the truth of God and the message of God.
[time=2497] You say, "How do I do that?" Well, I will tell you how you do not do it. You do not then make a vow to go into work and be sure you tell everybody there that you are a Christian and that they need to become a Christian on company time, which is a very common problem.
[time=2511] Christians feel it is their right and their responsibility by a higher calling in command to spend their time instead of arduously working for their employer to tell people about Christ on their employer's time.
[time=2521] That is not a biblical mandate. You say, "How do I adorn the name of God and the doctrine of God on the workplace?" I will tell you.
[time=2528] Number one, be on time. Get to work on time. And when you get to work on time, do what you are told to do as you are told to do it. Be a motivated, hard working, industrious, innovative, thinking, contributing employee who is faithful and supportive, and positive, and honest, and here is one.
[time=2548] Grateful for your job. Grateful for your paycheck. Grateful for the opportunity to contribute to that company and its welfare and that employer and all that he is doing.
[time=2559] If you do that consistently and you do that quietly and you do that faithfully, several things will happen where you work.
[time=2565] Number one, you will raise the curve. You will raise the curve. You will set a new standard for the employees in that place and you may incur their wrath.
[time=2573] Because oftentimes they don't like that kind of stuff. Secondly, you will become the prized commodity of your employer. You will be the one he likes. You will be the one he is thankful for. You will be the one who works as you ought to work. And most importantly, you will uphold the name and the doctrine of God.
[time=2591] When I was in China about six years ago, I ran into finally a cluster of these kinds of people with this kind of reputation. We were down in Shaman University setting up some trips for Master's College students and we were meeting with the University officials.
[time=2605] And these University officials had been inundated with students from the West, Australia, America, Europe, all the rest. And they came basically to define these groups of students into two basic categories, believers and unbelievers.
[time=2619] And what they wanted was believers. And what they didn't want anymore of were the unbelievers. Because the unbelievers came and they brought their rock music and they brought their drugs and they brought their promiscuous morals and their dances and their laxatives of a latitude in many cases towards their studies and lack of submission to authority. And they had had enough of that.
[time=2639] Remember now, this is China. This is a culture that if you've never been there, it's hard to describe. But this is a culture that's three or four hundred years old that has not been moved along the so-called cultural evolution that we experience here in this country. And they didn't want any part of it.
[time=2655] They wanted Christians. They wanted believers. They wanted young men and women who came with a higher and intrinsic motive of serving God, though they may not have been able to articulate it that way, but who were serious about their studies, took care of the facilities, were godly in relationships and friendly and supportive of the entire community.
[time=2673] They said that. We want Christians. Do you bring Christians? Are you a Christian college? We want your students. We don't want any more unsaved students. That's the way out of you. That's wonderful. We ought to be able to go out to all the places of employment in Fort Wayne and say to the employers, who's working for you? And they ought to be able to say there's two groups of people working for me.
[time=2693] They're the unsaved and saved. The saved people are the ones they want. Do you have any more of those? I like more of those. Why? Because these are the supportive people. These are the innovative people. These are the industrious people. These are the people who understand where I'm trying to go as an employer and will give themselves wholeheartedly in full respect and honor to what I am trying to accomplish. And they're even grateful for their paycheck.
[time=2717] You got any more of those people? I want them. I wonder if that would be the case. I wonder if that would be the case. I wonder if, and maybe you should evaluate yourself on this. I wonder if, when your boss goes home at night and he or she talks to the wife or the husband in the honest moment, what does he or she say about you and your employment?
[time=2741] You say, hey, this is great. This is wonderful stuff. This sounds like we all ought to work just like this, but you don't understand. My boss is a jerk. My boss is a dodo head. My boss is a spastic. My boss is difficult to work for. My boss is cruel. My boss brings sorrow into my life. You don't expect us to do this to you.
[time=2765] Well, come over to first Peter for just a minute. I want to introduce you to your boss. First Peter chapter 2. This is the passage for people who are in the unfortunate position to work for unregenerate people who don't have a heart for people.
[time=2787] Their mission in life is to make life difficult, especially maybe because you are a Christian. This is first Peter chapter 2. Look at verse 18.
[time=2797] Servants. Servants. Be submissive to your masters with all respect. That's just another way of saying what we saw in 1 Timothy 6th, honor your master. Now watch, verse 18.
[time=2810] Not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscious towards God, a man bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly, verse 20.
[time=2824] For what credit is there, if when you sin and are harshly treated you endure it with patience. In other words, if you've sinned in the workplace, if you've been ungodly towards your master and he traces you harshly, you should expect that.
[time=2837] You shouldn't get a medal for enduring underneath that, then again in the middle of verse 20. But if when you do what is right and suffer for it, you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God.
[time=2849] Now you're talking, verse 21, for you have been called for this purpose. Since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps.
[time=2861] Who committed no sin or was any deceit found in his mouth, he was blameless. He did nothing to deserve the suffering that came his way. Verse 23. While being reviled, he did not revile in return. While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges rightly.
[time=2876] Or righteously, and he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross. That we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[time=2883] In other words, if you want to know how to be Christ-like, and you've heard a lot about that, that's the mission of the believer, that's where we're headed, we want to be in conformity to the person of Christ. That's our great goal, that's our great end.
[time=2893] Verse 3 says that when we see him, we'll be like him, for we'll see him just like he is, we'll be totally, completely, conformed to Christ.
[time=2899] We'll be ultimately Christ-like. You want to know how to do that now? Doesn't necessarily involve more devotions and more prayer time and more attendance at church.
[time=2907] It involves when you are suffering in the workplace under the hands of an ungodly, unjust employer, treat him with honor and respect and obey him.
[time=2916] You'll never look more like Christ, and you'll never have a greater opportunity to present the person in the message of Christ than that very behavior.
[time=2925] It's amazing how the word of God works. Show Christ in the workplace by honoring your harsh, unfeeling employer.
[time=2935] And in so doing, honor the name of God and honor the doctrine of God.
[time=2941] Too many Christians see their jobs as a necessary evil. Too many believers see their job as just a necessary evil.
[time=2948] It's a means to gain an end or to gain things. Maybe material things, maybe a sense of self-worth, maybe a sense of position in the community.
[time=2957] Now, that stuff matters. It doesn't matter who you are by virtue of your position. We get into that trap all the time. We introduce ourselves and we say, "I'm so-and-so, and I do this."
[time=2965] And everybody gets defined based on what they do. It doesn't matter. It's inconsequential. Only in human eyes is that of any significance.
[time=2973] Instead, it's who we are in our character and our ability to work faithfully in the workplace. That's what makes us what we are.
[time=2979] And the world twists it around and says, "Because you hold some position, you're somebody." Not the way it is. I believe as believers, the word of God calls us to see the workplace as possibly our most significant arena to display the character of God.
[time=2996] Second, only to the home. As people look at your life, the first arena they're going to look at is your wife and your kids. For all of us, I'm saying this.
[time=3004] But beyond the way you treat your family, the beyond the way you run your home, beyond the way you love your family, the next greatest area of influence for the cause of Christ is what you do Monday through Friday in the workplace.
[time=3016] It is the arena that God has given you to display the character of God and to honor His name and to adorn the truth of God.
[time=3024] Come with me to one more passage. Over to Ephesians 6, you'll see the same kind of thought. Only the Lord adds to it. It's even more significant than the here and now. It's even more important than just honoring God day to day.
[time=3039] Ephesians 6, verses 5 and following, talking to the slaves. Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters. It's the exact same message.
[time=3047] Honor them, obey them, respect them, submit to them deeply from your heart. Now watch. Verse 5, "According to the flesh with fear and trembling in the sincerity of your heart as to Christ."
[time=3060] It comes from within you. This is not a facade. Verse 6 says, "Not by way of eyes service as men pleasers, but as slaves of Christ doing the will of God from the heart."
[time=3070] What Christ wants your employer to feel through you is a genuinely deep conviction that is bound up in your heart out of love for God that causes you to obey, respect, and honor that man or that woman.
[time=3084] Verse 7 says, "With good will," the word "good will" just means to wish blessings on other people. "Wishing blessings on your employer, rendering service as to the Lord and not to men." Now, verse 8, "Knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free."
[time=3102] This is an exchatological view. This is the end of the age. This is the beam of seat. This is you standing before Christ to be evaluated. Your spirituality, your godliness is evaluated and rewards are given or not given.
[time=3115] And part of it, a large part of it, is based upon your performance in the workplace. Not just the home and not just the church.
[time=3122] So the Lord takes our faith and he invades Monday through Friday. He wants to permeate it and he wants us to be fully permeated with the love of Christ as we honor and submit.
[time=3133] Failure to do it any other way is to mock the name of God in public and it is to dishonor the doctrine of the word of God.
[time=3142] Where are we if unbelieving employers prefer unbelieving employees because they find the unbelieving employee to be better motivated, more faithful, more consistent and more supported than his believing employees.
[time=3161] All of us have run into unbelievers who want nothing to do with Christianity or the Christian faith because they used to have a Christian employee.
[time=3168] That's all they need to know about Christianity. What it tells the unbelieving boss is that money is a better motivator than God.
[time=3178] Money is a better motivator than truth. These people who hold and cling for their very life and their eternity to the person of Christ can't find sufficient motivation to be faithful, integrable, hard working employees.
[time=3192] In fact the people I really want to hire are the people who simply just want money from me.
[time=3200] Sad state of affairs but it happens. Okay now back to first Timothy.
[time=3206] Chapter six and let's look at the believing boss. That's how believers treat the unbelieving boss. How do believers treat the believing boss, the Christian employer?
[time=3217] And that would mean whether you're at GTE and you happen to have a supervisor that's a believer or whether you work at this church or whether you work for youth for Christ or wherever you work you have a believing boss.
[time=3230] Verse two and let those who have believers as their masters not be disrespectful to them because they are the brethren because they are believers but let them serve them all the more.
[time=3241] When you enter into an arena in which both the employer and the employee are working in the same setting you have a whole new dynamic, a whole new set of game rules and it's not always healthy.
[time=3255] The word the word disrespect in verse two don't be disrespectful. It's a Greek word that draws the image of pulling a person down, pulling a person down from their place of authority.
[time=3268] And what Paul is guarding against is that because you happen to have a believing boss don't pull him down off of his position of authority just because you share a light precious faith.
[time=3278] Just because you're both heirs of salvation just because in the eyes of Jesus he died for both of you the same way and there is equality in the spiritual dimension of our Christian faith.
[time=3287] Don't pull them down don't don't degrade them don't rob them of their distinction as your superior as your authority and as your boss. This happens all the time in subtle ways. Christians will come in late from a lunch break and expect to be excused for that by their Christian boss because they were having their devotions.
[time=3308] Or they will expect to come in late because they were having a Bible study with some other people and somebody there had just a real vital question about the truth and they just couldn't tear themselves away and that's all supposed to be excused now that I'm 35 minutes late for work.
[time=3323] Now of course sometimes the Christian employer is delighted under those circumstances and he's giving you that permission but the point is don't grasp that don't assume that don't demand that instead work him all the more serve your believing master all the more work harder for him than you would for anybody else.
[time=3341] Sometimes a believer will say to their employer their believing employer man I'm sorry I didn't get that extra commission or didn't do that extra work I just didn't feel led of the Lord as if this is God's fault now that we're not making the kind of money we should or we didn't land the kind of deal.
[time=3356] That is just foreign thought that's just not here double your efforts serve him all the more work all the harder don't devalue his position of authority why what's the motive look at the end of verse two because because those who partake of the benefit are believers and beloved when you multiply your efforts and you work even harder for a believing employer you have the joy of knowing that your extra work.
[time=3385] Work benefits his status and his position you'll make your believing employer look better in that company because he'll be better because his department will do better because you're doubly.
