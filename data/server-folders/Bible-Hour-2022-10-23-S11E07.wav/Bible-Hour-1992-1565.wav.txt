[time=0] And John D. Rockefeller said this, "The poorest man I know is the man that has nothing but money."
[time=10] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=27] Thank you for joining us.
[time=29] The love of money is a dangerous passion.
[time=32] We were created to love God, Christ, the Word, our family, fellow Christians, but not money.
[time=39] When a person sets his heart after money, he will find it fills his life with more pain and sorrow than he ever thought possible.
[time=47] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the New Testament book of 1 Timothy.
[time=52] We'll be looking at chapter 6, verses 6 through 10.
[time=56] Our special music today will be provided by Bill Laman and by Lynn Raul.
[time=65] Let's join the service and progress as the congregation is singing the chorus, "Behold what manner of love."
[time=73] The love of God, the reason we hold the songs of love.
[time=103] From the moment man first disobeyed the Father.
[time=121] We were then held captive by our sin.
[time=128] The love of God demanded a sacrifice, restoring to himself his own again.
[time=146] So the lamb of God, God's only son was freely offered, but home and for our sins forever made.
[time=161] The innocent and holy still called and God only could rent some and redeem us back again.
[time=178] Hallelujah, your praise the Lamb.
[time=193] My heart sings his praise again.
[time=208] So to the cross they carried him with all our guilt and all our sin, the lamb on God was slain for our transgressions.
[time=225] And on the cross those nail pierced hands, reached out to God and down to man, and just as if I never sinned, he took me in his arms.
[time=240] Embracing me, he willingly fired K. On May, see grace and love that knows no boundaries.
[time=258] No guilty and condemned I know and free, forever I'm forgiven for Christ, the Lord is risen and risen with him.
[time=275] We shall one life here, for hallelujah, your praise the Lamb.
[time=290] Hallelujah, your praise the Lamb.
[time=363] Praise the Lamb.
[time=372] Well again we're so thankful that you've joined us for the Bible hour today and Russell we're fast drawing to a close this summer session and no doubt your children are excited about school.
[time=387] My girls are very excited about school starting they're setting up their desks for study and looking through their wardrobes and going shopping and they can hunt away.
[time=394] Well I just want to remind those of you that are watching if you're still interested in the Black Hawk Christian school there are a few openings not very many but if you're interested in rolling your children you need to call that office today at 4937400 and ask for information concerning openings in the various classes grades K through 12.
[time=414] I'm excited about the school year also we've had we've worked with the soccer team they look good they'll have their first game in a couple days and that's going to be a lot of fun.
[time=423] We want to look for it also to September 13th we will be having friend day at the church and Russell that'll be one service at 10 o'clock I'm looking forward to the guests it'll be with us.
[time=433] I think we'll have a lot of people visiting and we want to invite you to come as well if you've been watching us by the television here and you'd like to come and experience our worship center and maybe even come down and shake my hand and say hello to them.
[time=443] That's always encouraging so plan on that friend day September 13th at 10 o'clock.
[time=449] And then the Bible hour is sponsored a concert with Ray Bolts on Friday evening September 18th.
[time=455] It's a ticketed concert tickets are on sale at all of the Christian bookstores and here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and the cost is $5.
[time=463] The tickets are going very fast so I hope that you'll check with one of our local bookstores or call the church at 4937400.
[time=472] And then just before we close our booklet for this month is why is Christianity true.
[time=477] I'm going to talk to you more about it next week but it's just a very good study in the apologetics of Christianity and why it is indeed true.
[time=486] So I hope you'll write for this book right today for it at the Bible hour.
[time=490] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=497] Once again the title of the book is why is Christianity true and you can receive it by writing to the Bible hour.
[time=504] 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=511] Thank you for joining us today and we go back to the live portion of our service with more music and the message from our pastor Russell Moore.
[time=521] [MUSIC]
[time=530] There's much confusion in the world today.
[time=544] Peace has turned to fighting and love has turned to hate.
[time=551] This is not what God intended.
[time=554] This is not what He had planned.
[time=560] Things are very different now than when we first began.
[time=568] We say God is our Father. We say we trust in Him.
[time=575] We have left His ways for our ways and fallen into sin.
[time=582] Yet we claim to seek forgiveness and we say we'll follow Him.
[time=589] But God would not have let us do this place where we know Him.
[time=597] The only hope for the world is Jesus and the only hope for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=611] For how we lead Him we must seek Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=622] There is no other half we know than Jesus Christ, the only hope for the world.
[time=636] It's time for all of the people to call upon the Lord and pray to God Almighty to touch and heal our world.
[time=651] So if every heart would be unknown and every soul would turn to God,
[time=658] then love would rain in every heart and love would be inside.
[time=666] The only hope for the world is Jesus and the only hope for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=680] For how we lead Him we must seek Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=691] There is no other half we know than Jesus Christ, the only hope for the world.
[time=702] The only peace is the prince of He moving in our hearts today and the only good news is the good news.
[time=713] And Jesus is the world, the only hope for the world is Jesus.
[time=728] The only hope for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=735] For how we lead Him we must seek Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=746] There is no other half we know than Jesus Christ, the only hope for the world.
[time=757] We must seek Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=771] The only hope for the world.
[time=796] Amen. Thank you, Lynn. The only hope for the world is Jesus Christ.
[time=802] What's so amazing about the truth of that little phrase in that song is how few people in the world would know that.
[time=810] I mean, if you were to go downtown and Fort Wayne and get a little survey out and say what, you know, if something significant could change in your life, that would bring hope, what would you want?
[time=821] And what do you think most of the people would say? I think they'd say money.
[time=828] I think they'd say money. If I could give you anything in the world right now that would give you hope, what would you want?
[time=833] Most of the people in the world are going to say money. 90 million people played the lotto in this country.
[time=841] The lottery played the lottery in this country last year in 1991 and they spent 20 billion dollars doing it.
[time=849] That in light of the fact that you are more likely to get struck with lightning than you are to ever win the lottery.
[time=856] That's true. Statisticians have figured that out and all the people to play and all the people to win.
[time=861] Your odds are better. There's more likely that you'll get struck with lightning than you will win the lottery.
[time=866] But there are some who have won and they hold a dream. They hold a hope. Sheila Ryan of Florida won the Florida State Lottery of $55 million.
[time=876] Every year she gets a check for $2.8 million.
[time=882] It's enticing, isn't it? You think of yourself, man, what would I do with all that money?
[time=888] I mean, how would I spend that? Well, I don't know how Sheila spent hers but I did find out how a lady by the name of Gwen Sitgraves spent hers.
[time=895] She won a $10 million Ohio State Lottery. She gets a check for $400,000 every year for 20 years.
[time=902] She says she bought a Cadillac for $27,000. A mink coat for $10,000. A wild mink jacket for $7,000.
[time=909] A diamond ring for $6,000. Diamond stud ear rings for $4,000. Then she bought herself a diamond tennis bracelet.
[time=918] Then she bought a new $250,000 home. Then she furnished it with brand new furnishings that total over $100,000.
[time=926] Then she took two Caribbean cruises at $20,000. She took five trips to New York City at $2,000 per trip.
[time=933] She is planning a 10-day Black Sea cruise in July. This was written before July.
[time=938] And a new condo, she says, somewhere warm. Now she did say she's giving a church donation of $10,000 a year.
[time=946] I think that's big of her. Magnanimous.
[time=950] You know, the illusion is that somehow if I could just get more money, my life would be better than it is today.
[time=963] Isn't that true? Don't you think that? I think that. I don't play the lottery, but sometimes I dream that somebody else would buy a ticket and give it to me and I'd win.
[time=972] Wouldn't that be the best? Then nobody can be mad at me for playing the lottery, which I don't do, but I could have, you know, $10,000,000.
[time=980] And just think of how my life would improve if I could just have $10,000,000.
[time=987] The illusion about money is that it would improve my sense of well-being. It would give me peace. It would improve my relationships. It would help me out.
[time=996] I mean, I just can envision myself with $10 million and I just think, boy, I would just be so much better off.
[time=1003] The problem is there is nothing, even empirically, in the lives of people who have millions and millions of dollars to support that notion.
[time=1012] John B. Rockefeller said, "I have made many millions and they have all brought me no happiness."
[time=1021] Cornelius Vanderbilt said it this way, "The care of millions of dollars is too great a load. There is no pleasure in it."
[time=1030] Henry Ford, after making his millions of dollars, said, "I was happier when doing mechanics work."
[time=1037] John D. Rockefeller said, "The poorest man I know is the man that has nothing but money."
[time=1044] So even those who have gone before us and who have walked into or earned literally millions, fortunes, more than they can ever spend,
[time=1054] would tell you from the experience of their own life that money does not make the difference, but more than their experience, the Word of God.
[time=1061] And this morning, let's open our Bibles to 1 Timothy chapter 6.
[time=1065] As we continue our study in this epistle, and for those of you who are joining us this morning as a first-time visitor, it's our practice to preach through a particular book of the Bible and just expose it the Word of God as it unfolds itself before us.
[time=1080] And we end up talking about all kinds of different topics when we allow the Word of God just to direct our steps in that.
[time=1086] And we come this morning to the topic of loving money, loving money, being a money lover, or literally in the Greek, loving silver, being a silver lover.
[time=1096] And the passage is in chapter 6 verses 6 through 10.
[time=1101] The heart of the passage is at the beginning of verse 10, "For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil."
[time=1110] The love of money is a root, a root, not the root, not the only root, not the only source, but a source, a root, a wellspring for all kinds of evil.
[time=1122] Now first of all, it's important that we clarify the fact that having money is not a sin. Having lots of money is not a sin.
[time=1129] Money is not sinful. There is nothing sinful about money and there is nothing sinful about having lots of money. Abraham, the patriarch of God that he specifically chose out, was blessed by God and was worth fortunes.
[time=1142] I mean the man was enormously wealthy. Job, as you remember reading the first several verses of the book of Job, was also the possessor of many, many, many things.
[time=1153] And the word of God never condemns wealth in and of itself. It never speaks against being wealthy. What it speaks against is loving money, being attached in your heart to money.
[time=1165] And whether you have a lot of money, or whether you have very little money in either category, or whether you're in the spectrum somewhere in between, it is the love of money that is the root and the source of so much evil.
[time=1177] Now I thought as we begin this morning, maybe I could ask you a few questions by way of diagnosing or letting you self-diagnose your propensity or love of money. Here are five questions. Maybe these will help.
[time=1189] Question number one, do you spend your time thinking about how to get more money, or do you spend your time thinking about how to do a better job?
[time=1198] With respect to your place of employment, are you more concerned with how much you make than the quality of what you make? Of what you produce.
[time=1207] A person who loves money is consumed with the thought of getting more money. And their work and the quality of their work is important to them only in so far as it promotes their greater goal of making money.
[time=1219] And the opposite should be true. A person should be far more concerned about the quality of what they do and what they're contributing than what they're getting paid for it.
[time=1229] I know it sounds odd, but it's true. Second, maybe benchmark of a money lover, you know you love money when you never have enough.
[time=1240] You know you have money when you never have enough. You always need more money. No matter how much you have, there's always a need for more money. There's always something additional that money if you had it would buy and make you better.
[time=1254] Sometimes that's revealed by people who spend more money than they make. And that, by the way, is not as uncommon as it should be.
[time=1263] The third benchmark of a money lover, you know you love money when you want to flaunt it and all that it possesses.
[time=1272] You love your money because you love having your money because your money allows you to wear it and drive it and live in it. And the real thrill of all that is flaunting it in front of other people who are potentially envious of what you have.
[time=1283] Number four, you love money when you hate to give it. You love money when you hate to give it. The last thing on your list is giving money.
[time=1294] I mean that's the antithesis of everything you stand for. As a money lover, you stand again it and hoard it and use it on yourself at every opportunity and to break away several thousand dollars in any given year to contribute to the work of the Lord is just mind boggling.
[time=1309] I mean it's detestable. It's the last thing in the world I want to do with my money. Because if I just would take that five or ten or fifteen thousand dollars then I'm going to give the Lord this year and hoard it and keep it and invest it and it will multiply itself and then I have more money.
[time=1325] And if I can have more money then I can have more things. You love money when you hate to give it.
[time=1332] And number five, you love money when you'll sin to get it. You love money when you'll sin to get it. If you'll cheat on your income tax. If you'll cheat on your vow to God to give money to him that you pledged and then back up from that.
[time=1348] Not because you have to because you need food and clothing but because you want to buy something else.
[time=1355] Whether you cheat on your expense account at work. Whether you will compromise your convictions about morality and integrity and the person you believe you're to be in order to gain money.
[time=1369] You love money when you'll sin to get it. So five just beginning questions to help sensitize our own hearts to our vulnerability to the love of money.
[time=1379] Now this passage could be broken into two sections versus six through ten. The first section in verses six, seven and eight will describe for us what money cannot do.
[time=1389] What money simply cannot do and then verses nine and ten what the love of money certainly will do in your life.
[time=1396] And so we'll look at it under those headings. First of all the things that money cannot do. Verse six.
[time=1403] But godliness actually is a means of great gain when accompanied by contentment. Money cannot buy contentment. Now the word contentment means to be self-sufficient.
[time=1416] It means to be independent of circumstances and it's a powerful concept in the word of God but it is often mistaught.
[time=1423] It is often misrepresented to be some kind of uncircumstantial joy. Sometimes we talk about contentment in Christian circles and say that if you're really walking with God, if you're really studying the word of God, if you're really in touch with the spirit of God in your life, then horrible things can occur in your life and you'll still be a bounding enjoy.
[time=1446] That's not true. That's not true. In fact, that would not be to find a spiritual maturity. That would be to find a spiritual immaturity.
[time=1459] If your wife dies, if something that catastrophic in your life dies, she dies and you don't feel it. Don't call yourself spiritual, call yourself sick.
[time=1470] That's an unhealthy response. That's some type of wild denial that this person who meant everything to me in my life and my world is now taken from me. But because I'm walking with Jesus and because I love God and because I study the Bible, no problem. I'm fine.
[time=1486] I'm really thrilled actually. I enjoy the Lord. That's not health. That's sickness. The same would be true with the loss of a job and your person's fired because they're not performing well. The notion that I'm so in touch with God, I'm so in touch with the Word, I'm so in touch with the spirit of God. That really has no consequence on me. I don't feel that emotionally, I don't feel that mentally, I don't feel that in my body and stress. No, I just didn't immune to all that because you see I love God and God knows everything.
[time=1512] Think with me for a moment of the great men in the Word of God and how they felt circumstances in their life. Think about Habakkuk, the Old Testament prophet who was given the revelation from God that the caldians would come and wipe out his world as he knew it.
[time=1525] They were going to so thoroughly destroy Judah that his world as he knew it would cease to exist. His culture, his pattern of behavior, many potentially of his family members and his friends would be killed and taken away from him.
[time=1539] His whole world was going to change in the wrong direction and Habakkuk felt it. He felt it emotionally, he felt it spiritually, he felt it in every other way.
[time=1550] And he grappled with God and as he grappled with God and was forced by the circumstances to reaffirm his values and his eternal perspective and his love for God that he finally come at the end of the book to the resounding, I will rejoice in God.
[time=1566] Really, in light of my circumstances, not without any sense or awareness of my circumstances. The mature Christian embraces reality and allows that reality to so impact them that a proper response drives them to God and in being driven to God there is a peace and there is a joy.
[time=1583] But it is not uncircumstantial, it is in fact forced on him by his circumstances as he rightly responds to them. The same could be said of Christ. Christ was not immune to his circumstances. Christ did not find in his relationship with God some type of protective bubble that made him emotionally and mentally and spiritually and even physically detached and unaware and unimpacted by adverse circumstances.
[time=1609] Jesus stood in front of the grave of Lazarus, his good friend, one he loved and saw not only in the death of Lazarus due to sin but the death of a whole world due to sin and he wept.
[time=1619] He was very aware of his circumstances and he allowed those to impact him profoundly in the triumphal entry. The last time that Jesus ever came to the city of Jerusalem, he was with Lazarus having just raised him from the dead and Mary and Martha and others who were his best friends and a whole company of people behind him.
[time=1637] He was a horde, a throng of people coming from the city of Jerusalem because they knew Jesus was coming. It was a very public moment but he knew in his heart he was going to enter Jerusalem for the last time and the reason he was coming to Jerusalem was to die and to carry the weight of the sin of the world and to be separated from his father and so he openly and publicly wept.
[time=1656] He wasn't immune to his circumstances, it wasn't as if all but I'm the son of God and I'm in fellowship with God and I have no sin in my life and I'm meditating on the word of God and so all these circumstances whether they be bad or good really have no impact on me.
[time=1669] In fact you can go all the way to the garden of Gethsemiti with our Lord as he so anticipating the adverse circumstance of the cross asked and begged that the cup should be taken from him. He knew what was coming and he didn't want it.
[time=1681] And when God said no you're going to stay right in this path of obedience and you will die for the sins of the world that not only affected him mentally and emotionally and spiritually, it affected him physiologically and he sweat drops of blood.
[time=1693] That was a natural biological response to the pressure and the trauma of anticipating the horrible circumstance of bearing the sin of the world.
[time=1702] So be gone with this notion that Christians don't feel their circumstances that somehow that's unhealthy or that's unspiritual, that is a horrible concept.
[time=1713] In fact the beginning of salvation, the very entrance into the kingdom of God is an embracing of reality.
[time=1719] It is coming to grips with the fact that I am in reality not just kind of a nice person and my good deeds somehow outweigh my bad deeds and so I am tolerable in the sight of God and after all God is more of a kind of a wise old sage up there in heaven somewhere with gray hair and a long beard who when he sees me and my disobedience finds it tolerable and somewhat chuckles at it and helps me along my merry way.
[time=1742] And who then after my death will grant me some type of pardon for my misbehavior and grant me heaven and reality none of that is true and coming to Christ is realizing that.
[time=1752] That's what coming to Christ means. That's what Jesus said to the woman at the wall when he said there are worshipers and they will worship me in spirit and in truth and the word truth means reality.
[time=1760] If you want to worship God, worship him in the reality of your circumstances, the reality that you are not a nice person, you are a sinful person and you deserve hell, he is not some wise old sage, he is a wrathful God who will spew out condemnation and damnation on sin and those who have done that sin and that hell is a real place where people burn forever.
[time=1781] That is called getting saved coming to touch with reality, being unmasked from this pseudo reality that people want to build in their own minds and so they are the beginning of salvation is coming into grips with reality, so is the rest of salvation, so is the rest of sanctification, so is the rest of a person's life, embracing what is really going on in their life and finding in Christ the strength to live with purpose, to live in obedience, to live with love.
[time=1809] That's Christianity. In the same way that we are not to be unaffected or untouched by bad circumstances, we are also not to be unaffected by good circumstances, what kind of Christianity would that be?
[time=1823] I mean if I am supposed to be immune to circumstances, I will then be immune to bad circumstances and then I will be immune to good circumstances, so when God blesses me in some remarkable way, you will fail to hear from my lips words of gratitude and praise, and what would that lead us to?
[time=1838] I mean that was the very sin that he condemned back in chapter 4 in this asceticism, people abstaining from food and marriage and what God says is those were created by God to be gratefully shared and by those who believe in Him, to believe in know the truth.
[time=1853] God gives us marvelous circumstances so that we will be overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude so that from our lips we will speak in his praise and glory.
[time=1861] So a believer is right to embrace his life, both good circumstances and bad circumstances, and in good circumstances even with the children of Israel as they were ripped out of the womb of Egypt as God destroyed the most powerful nation on the planet at that time through the 10 plagues, they come through the Red Sea, what are they going to do?
[time=1882] Just sit there and say, well, I'm unaffected by that? No, instead they write Exodus chapter 15, it's the song of Moses, it's an entire chapter devoted to praising the true and living God who did such a deliverance.
[time=1894] They were affected emotionally, mentally and spiritually and physiologically by their circumstances and it evoked from them the praise of God.
[time=1903] So I don't understand and I don't agree with and I don't support and I caution you against any type of notion that says that the believer is somehow immune to being impacted by circumstances, whether good or bad, where bad circumstances come, embrace them, feel them, let them hit you as they were designed to and let it drive you to the person of God with a real sense of dependence that oftentimes we don't often have.
[time=1930] And if good circumstances come your way, allow yourself to praise God and feel the joy of them and to experience the goodness of God for then will come genuine praise.
[time=1943] Money can't do that, money can't buy that kind of life, money doesn't produce that stuff.
[time=1950] Contentment is not being oblivious to circumstances, it is the ability not to try to control circumstances but to react to them.
[time=1960] Contentment is the ability, the learned ability even as we saw in Philippians chapter 4 in the life of the Apostle Paul who says I have learned in prosperity and in poverty to be content.
[time=1971] That is a learned behavior that is the product of spiritual growth whereby he is able to walk with God and pursue God whether he has much or he has little, but certainly aware of either state he may have been in.
[time=1987] And you say where do we find the strength for that kind of life, it certainly isn't within ourselves, it is from God himself.
[time=1995] First Corinthians 3.5 says not that we are adequate or sufficient, same Greek word, same Greek idea, not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything is coming from ourselves but our adequacy is from God who also made us adequate as servants of the new covenant.
[time=2011] And Paul goes on in the next chapter, chapter 4, to describe the ministry of that new covenant as it works out in his life and he says I am an earthen vessel, I have inside me the treasure, the gospel in an earthen vessel, my body and the circumstances of ministering this treasure are very difficult.
[time=2028] He says I am afflicted in every way, he is aware of that, he is cognizant of the difficulty in his life, he says but I am not crushed.
[time=2038] I am perplexed, I am confused, I have questions about God and how it all works and how my ministry fits in and why these churches continually are led astray by false doctrine but I am not despairing.
[time=2051] Persecuted but not forsaken, struck down but not destroyed, always caring about in the body, the dying of Jesus, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in my body.
[time=2060] What you find in the life and the example of Paul is someone who is acutely aware of his circumstances, whether good or bad, but finds in his relationship with Christ not a sense of numbness to his circumstances but the courage to embrace his circumstances and live with purpose in the middle of them.
[time=2080] In fact in the beginning of that book, second Corinthians, he says I don't want you to be unaware of brother and of our affliction which came to us in Asia that we were burdened excessively beyond our strength so that we despaired even of life.
[time=2092] He was in fact at the edge of death and he knew it.
[time=2098] Money doesn't produce that kind of stamina, money doesn't produce that kind of contentment.
[time=2104] Money instead is an attempt to control an environment, it is an attempt to buy contentment and it simply is not for sale.
[time=2114] The second thing that money can't do, look again at verse 7 now, verse 6, verse 7, money cannot prepare us for eternity.
[time=2125] Money cannot prepare us for eternity and this is a very simple thought, very profound.
[time=2130] For we have brought nothing into the world so we can not take anything out of it either.
[time=2135] In the words of Ecclesiastes and in the words of Job, I came into this world naked and I am going to leave naked.
[time=2141] I can't take it with me when I die, you've never seen a purse pulling a U-Haul trailer, they don't tag that stuff along.
[time=2148] There is no point in it.
[time=2150] In other words, if you spend your life in the dedication of a massing wealth and in the love of money, you fail to prepare yourself for eternity.
[time=2157] You do nothing to prepare yourself for the destination of a soul.
[time=2162] In Mark chapter 8 verse 36, our Lord said, what does it profit a man?
[time=2166] You remember the verse? If he gains the whole world?
[time=2169] I mean if everything out there that could be possessed was possessed by that individual but he forfeits his soul, what does it profit a man?
[time=2178] What does he gain? The implication is nothing except for a very short amount of time called time and space, life here on earth.
[time=2185] Money cannot prepare a soul for eternity.
[time=2190] The third thing that money can't do is found in verse 8. Look at it.
[time=2195] And if we have food and covering with these, we shall be content.
[time=2200] With food and covering, the word covering is broad enough to include not just clothing but some type of shelter.
[time=2207] He's saying here that because of Christ and because of the ministry of Christ and the adequacy that comes from God, if I have food and I have clothing and something over my head, I can be content, which means I don't need a garageful of junk to feel content.
[time=2224] In other words, it draws the believer back to a simplicity of life, back to the real meaning of life, which is what? Relationships.
[time=2232] We live in a day that defines life as possessing things and possessing entertainment, buying entertainment.
[time=2239] And the world is fast moving in the direction to define its life and the success of its life and the joy of its life and the contentment of its life as by how many things it owns, how many trinkets and possessions and gadgets it owns, and how much entertainment it can afford to buy for itself.
[time=2256] It doesn't buy contentment. Food and covering frees the individual to enjoy what does bring contentment and that would be a focus on people and a focus on relationships.
[time=2268] It draws the believer back to the simplicity of life and Christ.
[time=2273] So money won't buy contentment, no matter how much of it you have, money will not prepare you for eternity and money will not draw you back to the simplicity of life in relationships, being content with just the bare basics.
[time=2288] Well, if that's what money can't do, what will the love of money certainly do?
[time=2293] Well, that's verses 9 and 10 and this is amazing.
[time=2296] The Word of God is so blunt and so straightforward. It says in verse 9, "But those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into ruin and destruction."
[time=2313] Now there's a process. There's a path there that he's revealing.
[time=2316] It begins with the wanting. Verse 9, "But those who want to get rich," it's the Greek word Bula Mai and it doesn't talk about the want of emotion. It talks about the want of the cognitive decision making process and the will.
[time=2328] It's describing a person who has decided in their mind to get rich.
[time=2334] I am dedicating my life to get rich. That is the thought process that goes on.
[time=2340] And once that decision has been made, he now walks down a path that ultimately leads to destruction and it begins there in verse 9 by falling into temptation.
[time=2350] Once a person has made a mental decision that he is going to live for wealth and the amassing of wealth, he is constantly falling into temptation.
[time=2358] And the word "fall" there doesn't mean that he comes in contact with temptation. It means he is coming in contact and succumbing to it. He is in the regular pattern of sinning, falling into and falling under the weight of temptation.
[time=2370] Why? Because the inner convictions, the internal sense of commitment to right and wrong has been ripped out and what has been placed there is instead a commitment to get money.
[time=2382] To get riches, that becomes the guiding principle of life. That becomes the grid through which decisions are made or not made.
[time=2388] And so there is no moral internal fiber to stand up against temptation so when it comes he falls. Over and over and over again.
[time=2396] So falling into temptation and then it says, and a snare, and that's a word that describes a trap that the hunter would capture his animal in.
[time=2405] And so the person who has decided to pursue money is like a senseless animal that has stepped in a trap and is now captured by that desire, is captured by that decision by the alluring power of money.
[time=2416] And wrench his body as he might, he can't free himself from it, he's caught, he's trapped, he's snared, the entrapment of money.
[time=2425] And then it says he has fallen into many foolish and harmful desires. The word desire is epithumea for lust. It's the strongest word in the New Testament for unbridled passion.
[time=2437] And this unbridled passion for money is mere foolishness and it's harmful. It's damaging.
[time=2445] And the word of God is replete with illustrations of that. Psalm 396 says, "Surely every man who walks about as a phantom, they make an uproar for nothing.
[time=2456] He amasses riches and does not know who will gather them. He's a fool. There is no wisdom in his choices of life.
[time=2464] There is no real fruit in his labor, temporal, but nothing of any eternal consequence or value. Lord, talking in Luke chapter 12, talks about the harmful foolishness of lusting after money.
[time=2482] There's somebody in the crowd before him and the guy yells out, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me." In other words, I want more than my share. I want to win the family lottery. I want to get the inheritance.
[time=2495] And he said to them, "Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed. For not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions."
[time=2506] That's what we've been talking about. Even if you have a whole bunch of stuff, even if you have a whole lot of possessions. Doesn't define your life.
[time=2514] Life is not defined by possessions. So he tells them a parable to make it a little more clear.
[time=2520] The land of a certain rich man was very productive and he began reasoning to himself saying, "What shall I do since I have no place to store my crops?"
[time=2529] And he said, "This is what I will do. I will tear down my barns and build large ruins and there I will store all my grain and my goods."
[time=2536] And I will say to my soul, "Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years to come. Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry."
[time=2546] But God said to him, "You fool. This very night your soul is required of you and now who will own what you have prepared?"
[time=2553] So is the man who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich towards God.
[time=2558] The Bible defines a fool as a person who lives their life for the here and now. A person who amasses riches so that they can be enjoyed.
[time=2567] And so that they can have a false sense of security so that they can build bigger barns and have so much money in the bank that they have no sense of dependence upon God.
[time=2576] All of that is harmful. All of that is foolish. That is not the way to live life.
[time=2585] It has no ultimate purpose. You say, "What's the right way to live life?" The right way to live life is to live to be rich towards God.
[time=2592] To use your time and the energy of your life, not in the pursuit of money, but in the pursuit of God Himself, administering in His name.
[time=2599] And if He happens to give you a lot of money along the way, that's fine. You'll have to shoulder that additional responsibility.
[time=2606] But that can't be the motive of life. That can't be the reason for living. The passion must be to be rich towards God, to invest in people's lives with money and time and your giftedness, to live for eternity.
[time=2623] That's what wise people do. That's what healthy desires are. And there should be a real passion for that in the heart of each individual.
[time=2631] As prone as we are to love money, we should instead choose to love God and His work and His ministry and His people and evangelizing lost souls. There is wisdom.
[time=2644] So the process then culminates at the end of verse 9. Look at what happens. They fall into temptation. That catches them in a snare.
[time=2652] Their life is then consumed with foolish and harmful desires, which then, concluding in verse 9, plunge them into ruin and destruction.
[time=2661] And that is a phenomenal word to plunge someone. It means taking somebody and dragging them down to the bottom of a lake or the bottom of an ocean.
[time=2670] It takes them completely out of sight. They literally are immersed in ruin and destruction. It overcomes them. They're out of sight. They're consumed by it. It swallows them up.
[time=2680] Irretrievable loss. That's where the love of money takes a person. That's where the decision to get rich takes a person.
[time=2688] It takes them into temptation. It takes them into entrapment. It takes them to foolish and harmful desires, which eventually plunge them into ruin and destruction.
[time=2698] And ruin typically associated with the soul and destruction typically associated with the body. It dams and judges the body and the soul to utter ruin.
[time=2711] That's what the love of money does. Be great to see a bunch of TV shows portraying that truth, wouldn't it?
[time=2718] This fall, a brand new series called The Love of Money, damning your life. They could just have episode after episode after episode after episode.
[time=2728] And they're replete. They wouldn't have to write new scripts. They could just look around.
[time=2733] But instead, we get fed the opposite. That the money is what makes life. And money is what makes you significant. And money gives ease. And money gives pleasure. And money gives contentment. And money can change things. And it can't.
[time=2747] It can be a useful tool in the hand of a wise steward to build a strong family and to build a strong church and to send missionaries out to win the cause of Christ.
[time=2760] But it can't change a person's inner disposition. It can't grant true contentment.
[time=2768] Then it moves from verse 9 and then into verse 10. It moves from a decision of the mind to the passion of the heart. And that's where we see this love of money.
[time=2776] It's now the passion, the consuming desire of this person's heart. And it is the root or the source of all these sorts of evil.
[time=2784] And some, by longing for it, have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many a pain.
[time=2791] I don't know if this particular individual was in the mind of Paul as he pinned this, but Judas comes to my mind. Judas who walked with the Lord, Judas who for three and a half years saw evidence after evidence, both in miracles and character and preaching all the arsenal of defense for the reality of the deity of Christ.
[time=2811] He saw first hand. He experienced the benevolence of Christ in his own life. Personally, he walked and talked with Christ. And at the end said, "I'll trade the Son of God for 30 pieces of silver."
[time=2821] He was a money lover. He loved money more than God. He loved money more than the Son of God. And as it says there, he pierced himself through with many a pain.
[time=2831] The word pierced is a picture of a rotisserie. And there's an animal on the rotisserie and it's the spike or the stake that has been driven the length of the animal.
[time=2840] The skewer which has been driven the length of the soul when a man and a woman decides to get rich.
[time=2852] There is no profit there. There is nothing to be gained.
[time=2860] So is the Passion of Money. Come with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 5 for just a minute. And listen to the wisest man who ever lived, Solomon.
[time=2873] He may have been, he was certainly the richest man of his era, may have been one of the richest men to ever live as well.
[time=2880] He had first-hand experience with money. And he was not some fool in many regards. He was brilliant gifted wisdom from God.
[time=2895] Ecclesiastes chapter 5. And look at verse 13.
[time=2903] He says, "This is a grievous evil which I have seen under the sun. Riches being hordered by their owner to his hurt.
[time=2911] When those riches were lost through a bad investment and he had fathered his son, then there was nothing to support him."
[time=2917] In other words, his wealth though massive could just be snatched away because its temporal. The thief can take it. A bad investment can take it. Then verse 15.
[time=2927] As he had come naked from his mother's womb so will he return as he came. He will take nothing from the fruit of his labor that he can carry in his hand.
[time=2938] And this also is a grievous evil exactly as a man is born, thus he will die. So what is the advantage to him who toils for the wind?
[time=2951] Listen and learn. I say to my own heart and I say to your heart because if I were to be honest with you and you were to be honest with me, I would suspect we both struggle with much of what we've talked about.
[time=2964] It's very easy to sit or to stand and speak and to affirm the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil. Yeah, that's true.
[time=2973] It's very easy to look at the devastating consequences of money in people's lives and say, "Boy, that's what money does." It's very difficult to divorce yourself from the love of money and begin to give it and use it in ways that are other than your own personal pleasure.
[time=2996] And I'll confess, I struggle with that. And so I speak to my own heart as I try to speak to yours this morning. And I try to say this, even as Paul has said it,
[time=3009] "Money cannot buy a quality of life. Money cannot change the way you live. If someone came up to you after this service and gave you ten million dollars, it would not substantially change the quality of your life.
[time=3024] It may lead you to utter destruction. It may lead you away from Christ. It may lead you on a thousand different trips all around the world such that your contact with people and a local church and evangelism might be utterly wiped out.
[time=3038] But it will not change the inherent quality of your life. Only Christ can do that. Only pursuing biblical principles in your life and obedience to them can change the quality of your life.
[time=3050] And if it wasn't ten million dollars, even if you were to take out a piece of paper and write down the three things you would like to buy, and we probably all have a few things that were waiting to buy.
[time=3061] Even if somebody gave you those three, you went home, there they were. When you're finished opening the package and putting it in place, what is it?
[time=3070] It's another thing. And you're going to find you're still you. You're going to find you're still the same person you were before. And if you struggle in certain areas, you're still going to struggle. And if you feel a lack of contentment, you're still going to feel that lack of contentment.
[time=3084] Money can't buy true satisfaction in the person of God.
[time=3092] Money can't prepare you for eternity. And money can't return you to relationships and a commitment to people.
[time=3099] What is the only thing that a love of money can do in your life? Destroy it. The only thing that a love of money can do in your life is tear it apart.
[time=3113] The decision to pursue it will lead you from one failure intimidation after another. It will eventually entrap you like a wild animal. You will then in foolishness make choices out of an unbridled lust that will only propagate your problems, and it will eventually plunge you deep into ruin and destruction.
[time=3136] And when the passion so consumes you, it can lead you away. It can cause you to wander from the faith and drive a skewer of disappointment and disillusionment and pain deep through your entire soul.
[time=3156] I found an interesting note about an individual who exemplifies this. It came from the Psy economy journal, which I think is a journal about psychology and the economy.
[time=3167] It had an article in there entitled this, "Winning the lottery is the worst thing that could happen to you." They may be right.
[time=3175] It went on to conclude that money can't buy you happiness. And it also made the point that if large amounts of money are infused into a person's life too quickly,
[time=3185] it can even bring mental illness and death. And to support the claim, they talked about a guy by the name of Bud Fischmann.
[time=3193] Bud Fischmann, 41 years old, a computer programmer making $45,000 a year in the state of Georgia.
[time=3200] He stopped by and bought a few lottery tickets, and he won $2 million. And he was overjoyed. So he quit his job.
[time=3211] And then he went home and found that within a week he had received 23 pre-approved credit applications for that many credit cards.
[time=3222] In other words, everybody who had a credit card company in the world knew he won the lottery. And they all sent him a pre-approved application. All he had to do was sign it and return it and he had the credit.
[time=3230] He signed all 23 of them and ended up with $210,000 of credit on these 23 cards total.
[time=3238] So having nothing to do because he wasn't working, he went out and bought. And the culminating buy was a whale-shaped pool in the back of his house.
[time=3251] That took the full credit extension of nine of his credit cards. This all happened at a very brief amount of time.
[time=3258] He finally got his first lottery check. Now he thought he was going to get all $2 million at once. What he got was a check for $70,000.
[time=3269] And he'd spent... Now his lottery check wasn't enough to pay the interest on all of his purchases.
[time=3278] After three years of therapeutic counseling and anti-depressant drugs, he went to the top of his house and jumped off his house into his whale-shaped pool which had no water in it to kill himself.
[time=3291] That was it. Now he probably had some problems before he got that money.
[time=3299] But I'll tell you what I'm thankful that I don't have all that money. I really am. I mean there are times when I could see it differently as you could too.
[time=3313] But you know why? I don't know what I would be like. I mean if you gave me like $2.5 million a year, I don't know what it would turn me into.
[time=3324] I really don't. And I don't want to find out. I guess I'm a little bit like that verse in Scripture that says, "Lord, give me just enough." So I've got something to eat.
[time=3336] But don't give me so little that I'll steal. God knows our balance. God knows where we're at. And those of you in the room today who have huge amounts of money and some of you probably do.
[time=3347] Now we need to pray for you guys. You have more responsibility than the average person. You have this huge temptation to be independent of God and to pretend you control your world.
[time=3360] And we want to pray for you. And for those of us who, some of you who have very, very little, that's a very difficult place to be.
[time=3367] And those circumstances wear on you. And you are tired of carrying around the enormous burden of how in the world, spending as frugally as we can, are we going to make it to the next paycheck.
[time=3378] That's difficult. That hurts. And we would pray that God would encourage you to move towards Him and find meaning and purpose and contentment, even under those kinds of circumstances.
[time=3391] And for everybody in between to understand that God knows what your wealth is, He has given you what He has given you. Praise Him for it. But be thankful. Be satisfied and pursue Christ. Let's pray together.
[time=3409] Father, I'm thankful for the Word of God.
[time=3417] We hope that you enjoyed the music from Lynn Roll and Bill Laman today. Our message was from our pastor, Teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3425] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3433] If you're Heavenly Father, I thank you that you're a loving and compassionate God. And today I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3443] And thank you, Lord, that as I accept you, I know that I have eternal life. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=3452] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision? When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3464] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the book entitled "Why Is Christianity True?" Please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
