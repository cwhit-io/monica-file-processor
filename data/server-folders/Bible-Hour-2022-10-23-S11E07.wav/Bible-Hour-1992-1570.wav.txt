[time=0] Then Revelation 12 4 says that the tale of the dragon took a third of the angels with
[time=8] him when he went, a third of the angels. And so these angels no longer being referred
[time=14] to as God's holy angels, but in Matthew 25 they are called the devil and his angels.
[time=21] These are the demons. These are now instead of being pristine, pure, clean, righteous, holy, subservient, submissive angels, are now unclean spirits, Luke 11, evil spirits,
[time=32] Luke 8, spiritual forces of wickedness, Ephesians 6, the spirit of divination, Acts 16.
[time=53] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=62] Demons, the devil's angels, unclean spirits, spiritual forces in heavenly places. Stay
[time=68] with us today as Pastor Moore takes us to the Word of God in an exciting study of demon possession and exorcism. We encourage you to locate your Bible today's message will use selected passages from several portions of the Bible. Our special music today will feature our own sanctuary choir, the men singers, and Laurie Shimon. Let's now join our
[time=96] service. [MUSIC]
[time=126] [MUSIC - 358 seconds]
[time=514] [APPLAUSE]
[time=520] All again, thank you for joining us for the Bible. Our Russell, we've already had some good music from the choir and the quartet. That quartet just kind of inspires us. It's a lot of fun to sing. Yeah, I think it's impossible to listen to that kind of music and not smile.
[time=534] It just draws that out of you, the excitement. There's a positive spirit in a lot of quartet music. And occasionally we need that, just to let the people know that there is a great day coming when we'll be in heaven together. Well, as I said, we're glad that you joined in with us today. And this will be the second in a series of messages from our pastor,
[time=553] teacher Russell Moore. And Russ, I think it's a very timely subject on Satan and demonism.
[time=558] Maybe you can just tell us a little bit more about what's ahead.
[time=561] Well, it's an invigorating study. And the point of it is to go back to the Word of God and
[time=567] to allow the Word of God to shape our thinking. There has been so much written from a fictional
[time=573] point of view that we read it as fiction. And then later it slips into theology for us.
[time=578] And so today we'll look at what demons can do to unbelievers. And then in weeks to come we're
[time=584] going to focus on what believers can do, excuse me, what demons can do to believers.
[time=588] As far as binding Satan and being delivered from Satan and demons and that whole thing within the Christian realm. So I'm excited and I hope you'll follow along with the study.
[time=597] Well, I bring this up because it is very important that if you watch the Bible, you'll make it a point to stay tuned on a regular basis so that you can hear all of these messages.
[time=608] And even at the close of our broadcast today you can know and hear how you can receive
[time=614] cassette copies of our message. And I want to tell you about the miracles that are coming October 4th to our church. It's a group of people from Mississippi. And they really have a great
[time=625] message in song. Many of them are mentally disabled. But when they sing and they play instruments,
[time=631] the Lord really takes over in their lives and they'll be an inspiration to use.
[time=635] So I hope you can come and join us at the Black Hawk Baptist Church at 6 p.m. on October 4th.
[time=641] And then I just want to say in closing that we want you to be reminded that we're preparing a cassette right now. And you can write for it. It's a cassette recognizing 10 of our soloists here at the Bible hour and at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=658] And we're recording them right now. And if you'll send in a donation of $10 or more, we'll send you this tape. We need some lead time. It'll be a while before it'll be ready. But
[time=669] you can request it by simply writing to the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=675] and the zip code is 46815. Once again, that's the Bible hour. 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=684] and the zip code is 46815. Or really, really delighted that you tune into the Bible hour. We saw
[time=692] some people again this week that told us that they watched the Bible hour regularly and we're grateful for that. You stay tuned now for some more music and then our message from our pastor
[time=703] teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=714] All the world is longing to know security.
[time=730] All the world is listening. Trying to hear words they can
[time=742] believe. But there is only one voice calling us by name. One truth we can hold on to forever.
[time=767] He remains the same. Oh, I want you to see that God's love never changes.
[time=783] His love never fails. When the world is shaken, we can put our faith in knowing that his love will never change.
[time=813] Never separated. Never far away. God alone is faithful proving his love with the price.
[time=843] [MUSIC - 139 seconds]
[time=994] Amen, Lord.
[time=997] If you'll take your Bibles this morning, let's open it to Mark chapter 5.
[time=1004] I want to set our thinking this morning for our study by reading two passages from the book of Mark 1st Mark chapter 5 verses 1 to 13.
[time=1016] Mark 5, 1 to 13.
[time=1021] And they came to the other side of the sea into the country of the garracines.
[time=1026] And when he had come out of the boat immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met him.
[time=1033] And he had his dwelling among the tombs and no one was able to bind him anymore even with a chain because he had often been bound with shackles and chains.
[time=1042] And the chains had been torn apart by him.
[time=1044] And the shackles broken in pieces.
[time=1047] But no one was strong enough to subdue him.
[time=1051] But constantly night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and gashing himself with stones.
[time=1058] And seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran up and bowed down before him and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What do I have to do with you, Jesus, son of the most high God?
[time=1067] I implore you by God, do not torment me." For he had been saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit." And he was asking him, "What is your name?" And he said to him, "My name is Legion.
[time=1080] For we are many." And he began to entreat him earnestly, not to send them out of the country.
[time=1086] Now there was a big herd of swine feeding there on the mountain.
[time=1090] And the demons entreated him saying, "Send us into the swine so that we may enter them." And he gave them permission and coming out, the unclean spirits entered the swine and the herd rushed down the steep bank and into the sea, about 2,000 of them and they were drowned in the sea.
[time=1106] Now come over to Mark chapter 9, just a few pages over.
[time=1112] Let's look at verses 17 and following.
[time=1115] Mark 9, 17.
[time=1118] And one of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought you my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute." And whenever it seizes him, it dashes him to the ground, and he foams at the mouth and girds his, grinds his teeth and stiffens out.
[time=1133] And I told your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do it.
[time=1138] And he answered them and said, "Oh, unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you?
[time=1142] How long shall I put up with you?
[time=1144] Bring him to me." And they brought the boy to him.
[time=1147] And when he saw him immediately, the spirit threw him into a convulsion and falling to the ground began rolling about and foaming at the mouth.
[time=1155] And he asked the father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And he said, "From childhood." And it has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him.
[time=1166] But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help us.
[time=1170] And Jesus said to him, "If you can, all things are possible to him who believes." Immediately the boy's father cried out and began saying, "I do believe, help my unbelief." And when Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, he rebuked the unclean spirit saying to it, "You deaf and dumb spirit, I command you come out of him." And do not enter him again.
[time=1193] And after crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out.
[time=1197] And the boy became so much like a corpse that most of them said he is dead.
[time=1201] But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him.
[time=1204] And he got up.
[time=1207] We're involved in a series on Satan, demons, and spiritual warfare.
[time=1214] And I thought it fitting to set our minds this morning by those very graphic illustrations of what demons do when they possess unbelievers.
[time=1226] And as you remember, we began two weeks ago by looking at Satan.
[time=1229] And we found from Ezekiel, chapter 28, that Satan was not originally called Satan.
[time=1233] He was originally called Lucifer, a beautiful name describing a beautiful angel as God had created him, a cherub.
[time=1240] Not just a common angel, but one of those called the cherub that were given protection to guard the very presence and the glory and the holiness of God.
[time=1249] We understood from Ezekiel 28 that Satan may have even had a position of high rank among the cherub for he was called an anointed cherub.
[time=1257] It says also in Ezekiel 28 that he had the seal of perfection.
[time=1261] He was created absolutely perfect and righteous until in righteousness was found in him.
[time=1267] When he allowed the glory and the splendor and the beauty of God's creation in him to cause him to be proud and lifted up.
[time=1275] And Isaiah 14 says that he entered the very throne room of God and with a clinch fist said, I will.
[time=1281] I will raise my throne above your throne.
[time=1283] I will have my place above the clouds of heaven, above the glory of God.
[time=1287] The angels from this day forward will take their orders from me and no one else.
[time=1292] I will usurp the true and living God.
[time=1296] And so God threw him down out of heaven, threw him out of the place of privilege and in Revelation 12 verse 4 it describes the dragon and his tail taking a third of the angelic host with him.
[time=1311] It was that very day, that very time, that the demons, as we know them today, came into existence.
[time=1319] And so they are no longer God's holy angels.
[time=1322] Matthew 25, 41 calls them the devil and his angels.
[time=1327] They are referred to as unclean spirits in Luke 11, evil spirits in Luke 8, spiritual forces of wickedness, in Ephesians 6, and a spirit of divination in Acts 16.
[time=1340] They are now unclean.
[time=1342] They are immoral.
[time=1343] They are unholy. They are given to ungodliness.
[time=1347] They are, however, like Satan, possessors of intellect, choice, will, and they are held morally responsible by God.
[time=1355] They are not just undefined phenomenon in the universe somewhere.
[time=1360] They are real persons, spirit beings.
[time=1365] But they are not all the same.
[time=1367] They are in fact our three different categories of the demons.
[time=1370] And by way of introducing the subject to us this morning, let me describe these three categories to you.
[time=1376] The first category of demons are those which are permanently bound.
[time=1380] In Genesis 6, we find the account that Satan somehow had persuaded some of his demons
[time=1386] to take the form of human bodies.
[time=1388] We know that demons can do that.
[time=1392] Genesis 19, the two angels visit lot in Sodom and they come in the form of males in the human race and Sodom so full of homosexuals see the splendor and the glory of these human beings, the appearance of human beings, these angels masquerading as humans that they about tear lots house down trying to get after them.
[time=1414] Demons, spirits have the ability to take the form of the human body and some did in Genesis 6.
[time=1420] They are called the sons of God.
[time=1422] And it says they saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they took unto themselves wives.
[time=1428] We believe that it was Satan's attempt to create a third race of some kind and disrupt the plan of redemption.
[time=1436] God sending the God-man Jesus to redeem the human race but as Satan in Genesis 6 could propagate a third race, a third something, half angel, half human, then the plan of redemption would not be complete.
[time=1448] And you'll notice in the flow of Genesis then comes the great flood in which God wipes out all of humanity except for Noah.
[time=1456] These demons have been tartarized.
[time=1459] It says so in 2 Peter 2.4, the place that they are now permanently bound is a place called tartarus.
[time=1467] It says in 2 Peter 2.4, for if God did not spare angels when they sinned but cast them into hell and committed them to pits of darkness, reserved for judgment.
[time=1478] You say, "How do you know those are the same demons of Genesis 6?" Well, verse 5 here says, "And did not spare the ancient world but preserved Noah a preacher of righteousness with seven others when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly." This place is called tartarus.
[time=1495] It is a place of eternal bondage.
[time=1498] It is a place from which they will never be released except at the end of the age to be thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=1505] These same demons are referred to again in Jude 6, it says there, "And angels who do not keep their own domain but abandon their proper abode,
[time=1515] he has kept an eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day."
[time=1522] So we find here a description first of all of certain demons, a part of those third that Satan took with him when he fell from heaven, who have because of their cohabitation with men or actually women have been thrown into eternal bondage.
[time=1538] In fact, it is these very spirits that Jesus went in preach to when he was in the grave
[time=1544] before his resurrection.
[time=1546] It says in 1 Peter 3, 18, "For Christ also died for sins, once and for all the just for the unjust in order that He might bring us to God, having been put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit small s, verse 19, in which He also went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison."
[time=1566] These are the spirits of Jude 6, the spirits of Genesis 6.
[time=1571] These are those which have been chained in eternal bondage.
[time=1575] Jesus went in preach to them, not the young Galio, the word to evangelize, not that word for preach in the Greek, but the other word, Caruso, which doesn't talk about giving the gospel, Caruso is just to make proclamation.
[time=1587] Jesus went in there and preached. He Caruso, he proclaimed his ultimate victory over Satan and these demons through his death on the cross.
[time=1596] So these demons, though they are tartarized, though they are held eternally in bonds only to be released, to be thrown into the lake of fire, already have heard from Jesus the battle is over and he has proclaimed to them the victory.
[time=1610] The second group of demons can be found in Luke 8. Luke 8.31 and I'll apologize,
[time=1618] I guess the nature of this message is topical, not expository, so we're going to move from passage to passage to passage.
[time=1625] If you'd like, just take notes and you can reference these passages later.
[time=1629] If you're up for it and your fingers are nimble, we welcome you to come along.
[time=1633] Luke 8.31. It says they were in treating him not to command them to depart into the abyss.
[time=1643] The word abyss in its adjective form means bottomless or unfathomable.
[time=1648] As a noun, it talks about a deep pit.
[time=1651] The abyss in scripture is never tied to the eternal place of punishment, never tied to tartarist. It is a different place of temporary holding where God or Jesus Christ will send demons to the pit and holds them there for a particular amount of time.
[time=1668] In Revelation 9 you'll see the abyss mentioned and here demons are flooding out of the abyss in the tribulation to torment the unredeemed.
[time=1676] It is the abyss in Revelation 20 verse 1 that Satan is thrown into for a thousand years.
[time=1682] So it is not a place of eternal holding or complete holding, it is a temporary place of holding that many demons and Satan himself will eventually be held in for a temporary period of time.
[time=1694] We don't know how many. We obviously don't have all the account of demons that have been sent there, but that is a holding tank of a temporary nature for the demons.
[time=1702] The third category of demons are those which are still loose.
[time=1706] They are still loose. They are still free. They are still free to do the bidding of their commander in chief, the devil.
[time=1713] They are referred to in Ephesians 6 verse 12 where it says our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, powers, world forces of this darkness and spiritual forces of wickedness.
[time=1724] These are the demons against which you and I must contend. These are the demons which plague the earth.
[time=1730] These are the demons which will have sway with the unredeemed.
[time=1734] And I thought this morning we would focus our attention on these demons and their activity in the unbelievers' life and the world of the unbelieving.
[time=1743] When we preach next time on this topic, we'll talk about demons and the Christian.
[time=1749] And can demon possess a Christian? What is their form of oppression and their ministry and their activity in opposing the cause of Christ in the believers' life?
[time=1759] But this morning demons and the unbeliever. First of all, we would begin to note that Satan and his demons are capable of supernatural miracles.
[time=1772] They are capable of supernatural miracles. There are basically three words in the New Testament that describe the miracles of Christ.
[time=1780] They are powers, signs, and wonders. Those three words. Acts 222, it says, Jesus the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs, or powers, wonders, and signs.
[time=1795] The apostles did the exact same kinds of miracles. Hebrews 2.4, God also, bearing witness with them by signs, wonders, and miracles.
[time=1804] So those are the three terms. When you think about the miracles of Christ, the miracles of the apostles, those are the terms that describe their miraculous efforts.
[time=1813] Those exact same three terms are used of Satan's capacity in his dominating this earth. Second Thessalonians 2.9, talking about the antichrist, the one who's coming is in accord with the activity of Satan with all power and signs and false wonders.
[time=1833] Revelation 133 talks about the antichrist and one of his miracles being able to call fire down out of heaven onto the earth in the presence of many witnesses.
[time=1842] Your mind probably goes back to the book of Exodus and the magicians in the court of Pharaoh who were able to duplicate in many instances the very miracles of God through Moses.
[time=1854] Now they weren't able to reproduce all of them. They could reproduce many of them. And of course when they reproduced the miracles, they only brought further plight and plague upon the people.
[time=1865] These demonic magicians were not able to reverse the miracles of God and bring healing, but they in many instances could reproduce them.
[time=1873] The demon possessed girl in Acts chapter 16 that was plaguing Paul and Silas was bringing much profit to her master because she had a spirit of divination.
[time=1882] And whether or not the divination spirit could tell her the future which she would then prophesy and receive money for, or whether she would say something and then that demon would go around and make it happen.
[time=1892] We're not sure, but it's clear that miraculous things were happening through this woman in her ministry which accounts for the anger in the hearts of those who owned her for once the spirit was gone so was their hope of profit.
[time=1905] They took Paul and Silas beat them and threw them in prison.
[time=1909] So we begin with an understanding that Satan and demons are capable of performing full fledged, bona fide, unadulterated miracles.
[time=1917] Now, as a footnote, when you and I understand that those signs, wonders and powers were given in a displayed in Christ and given to the apostles in the early New Testament churches history to confirm that they indeed were speaking on the behalf of God.
[time=1933] And now that the canon is full and complete, that those sign gifts and those sign miracles have ceased.
[time=1941] When I hear of people telling these miraculous stories of signs and wonders and miracles and attributing them to God, my mind doesn't go first to God.
[time=1951] It goes first to Satan and demons and posing as angels of light seeking to deceive people and to put their trust in signs and wonders and miracles instead of the complete and finished objective revelation in the Word of God.
[time=1966] I'm not saying that God doesn't still in some ways in these times perform signs and wonders and miracles but when a whole movement is devoted to that and that becomes the focus of their efforts, my mind doesn't go to God as the source of that but instead as Satan being the source of that.
[time=1982] So first of all, they are capable of performing full-fledged miracles. Secondly, they give supernatural strength to those they inhabit.
[time=1991] If you were to read Acts chapter 19, you would find the sons of Skiva. There were seven of them and they were trying to cast the demon out of this demon possessed person but instead the person leaped on them and subdued both of them and overpowered them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded.
[time=2011] There is supernatural strength in those that our demon possessed. Mark 5, we already read that passage, no one was able to bind him anymore even with a chain because he would break them apart. Supernatural strength.
[time=2026] Thirdly, they have a supernatural presence because they are spirit beings while they are finite, they are not possessing the qualities of the infinite God and being omnipresent.
[time=2037] They aren't everywhere at once. They are one place at one time. There can be, as we noted in Luke 8, a legion of demons dwelling in one man.
[time=2047] A legion of soldiers was anywhere from three to 6,000 men and their attendant support soldiers. So we believe that or understand that inside the locale of one human body can be as many as 6,000 demon spirits at one time.
[time=2064] Once there, they are capable of disabling the human body. Mark 9, they bring dumbness. Matthew 12, they bring blindness.
[time=2071] Luke 13, they bring deformity. There was a woman there who had bent over and bent over and could not straighten her body for 18 years because of a demon that was in her.
[time=2080] Matthew talks about epilepsy and these convulsions and this falling on the ground in convulsion.
[time=2087] Now, please let me note that the Bible does not say that every time someone is sick, it's because of a demon. When sickness is there because of a demon, the Bible points that out.
[time=2098] In other words, the Bible recognizes natural sickness. So as a result, when you and I are sick with something, we should not immediately say, "Oh, I've got a demon."
[time=2106] The recipe of remedy here is not my doctor. It's somebody to come cast this demon out or get this demon off of me. The Bible recognizes natural illness. It also recognizes that demons can cause illness.
[time=2120] Number 5, you'll find that once inside the demon will do everything to degrade the one at possesses and to bring self-destruction upon the one at possesses.
[time=2130] In Luke 8, a degrading thing, the man was nude and had been nude and did not wear clothes. He was filthy and he lived in the tombs.
[time=2139] That's an odd place to make your place of a boat, but that was the demon's delight. That was the demon's preference to live in and among death.
[time=2148] Mark 9, to throw himself both in the fire and into the water to destroy him. Oftentimes, the demon would take this young boy and throw him into the fire, someone was cooking, or throw him into the water near a lake or a pond in hopes that he would burn to death, or he would drown.
[time=2165] Mark 5, the demon there, caused the man to keep gushing himself with stones. In Luke 9, the spirit would seize him and he would suddenly scream, and it would throw him into a convulsion with foaming at the mouth, and it mauled him and would scarcely leave him.
[time=2183] So you gain insight, don't you? Into the heart of Satan and into the heart of demons and what evil when left unchecked by the spirit of God will present itself and produce in people's lives.
[time=2196] So this is about as dark and about as sinister and about as ugly as side of reality that we can find. Nothing could be more gross than the descriptions we've read even this morning of people demon possess with the self-destructive desires that reside in those demons.
[time=2213] But I should say to you that this is not the worst side of what they do. This is not the most grotesque of their efforts.
[time=2221] Only a few people who have ever lived or who will live will find themselves possessed actually by demons. The vast majority who will be taken in by demons will not have that because of possession. It will be because of four other things that demons do, and I want to cite those for you this morning.
[time=2238] The first is a reference from Deuteronomy 32 verse 17 and God is bringing judgment upon the nation of Israel for worshipping idols of actual physical, literal idols, and he says to them that they sacrificed to demons.
[time=2253] The word of God is clear that behind the actual idol, behind the actual Buddha, behind the actual figurine that would sit in someone's house or would fill the false religious houses of the world, those are energized.
[time=2265] And right behind them are the demons.
[time=2269] Idols are visible symbols of invisible demons. They are brought to us by demons. They are inspired by demons. And they are the front of demons and for all their activity.
[time=2281] And all you have to do, many of us in America are really sheltered from this. America is not full of a lot of overt, occultic idol worship.
[time=2290] But when in the orient standing there in the midst of one of these temples to a false religious system, full of all the idols you can imagine, many of them just plighted over and very cheap in nature, but they were revered in the hearts of these people and they would come into this house of false worship.
[time=2309] I saw one lady come in when I was in Korea and bend down and take these divining stones and the people who knew the situation said she had a child who was sick and she would huddle over these divining stones and pray and cast them and throw them and look for some type of evidence.
[time=2324] And I am not uncertain that she didn't get some kind of communication through them.
[time=2328] It was real to her because the demon is capable of communicating through that.
[time=2333] The problem is she thinks she's in contact with a benevolent loving God. When in reality she has linked herself to Satan and his schemes and plans.
[time=2342] We walked into a beautiful edifice, very expensive false religious house of worship in Japan and was amazed to look up on the ceiling and find this gorgeous painting of none other than a red dragon.
[time=2357] In all his fierceness with fangs and claws and tail and you think to yourself my lands, he's painted himself on the wall.
[time=2366] I mean he has brought himself right into focus as the very object of worship. He is behind that stuff and his demons energize those idols.
[time=2375] Think with me if you will of the billions of people who this very day, this very weak, will be with full hearts of sincerity worshipping idols.
[time=2388] And the fact is they are worshipping the demon behind the idol.
[time=2393] The second way in which demons work in the broad scope of things as we've noted in our study of 1st Timothy, 1st Timothy 4/1, the seatful spirits and doctrines of demons.
[time=2404] These are demon doctrines and I want to address it here not to the kind of bizarre stuff of false religions that we've just been talking about.
[time=2412] But let's think about the incredible success that demons have had in the United States of America in the last 30 or 40 or 50 years.
[time=2421] They will bring their demon doctrines right into the seminaries of those days and produce men who are not committed to the inherent word of God, who are not committed to the notion of regeneration and a personal salvation with Jesus Christ.
[time=2436] And instead they will promote entire denominations which have been weakened by these demon doctrines who almost seem to say that if you're one of us by just being a part of us, it's salvation by denominational affiliation.
[time=2449] And everybody's a part of the kingdom of God and everybody's a part of the family of God.
[time=2453] And in those churches you will not hear the confronting biblical preaching on sin and repentance and salvation and a personal walk with Jesus Christ.
[time=2462] Instead you'll hear a lot of religious platitudes that make everybody feel welcome and make everybody feel as though they're saved.
[time=2470] Never would bring up the notion of damnation and hell and being lost personally before a righteous and holy God who demands perfection or death.
[time=2479] I mean just look at the churches in America today, the demons have been remarkably successful.
[time=2485] That is all energized by Satan and his demons.
[time=2490] And on the other side of the spectrum there is another great group of churches in America today who preach an easy believeism, who preach an emotional gospel, a decisional regeneration, a way of coming to Christ that merely says if you pray a prayer, Jesus, I love you or Jesus I believe in you or Jesus I want you or whatever these words may be.
[time=2509] And even though then that person goes on to live a completely ungodly and sinful and selfish unregenerate lifestyle, they are assured over and over and over again by these churches that they're saved.
[time=2521] When there's no evidence of that in the word of God.
[time=2524] So the demon doctrines water down the gospel, they rip it out of what used to be fundamental churches or they change the gospel sufficiently to be just some type of notion of Jesus.
[time=2534] And I've asked him in my heart so automatically I'm saved, even though there's no regeneration, there's no fruit, there's no repentance, there's no evidence of true salvation.
[time=2545] That is how they'll send most people to hell, not through this overt demonism stuff but through their false doctrine and through their idols.
[time=2553] Thirdly, 2 Corinthians 4, 4 talks about the fact that Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelieving and I believe this verse primarily talks about secularism, the unreligious, the unchurched, the removed from any type of religion.
[time=2568] They're just totally wrapped up in the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life and they're all caught up in the movement and the cultural tins of their day and the gospel is foolishness to them.
[time=2580] That's all dominated and controlled by Satan then 4thly and lastly, Matthew 13, Jesus talks about the parable of the wheat and the tears and you remember the field and view are truly born again believers, the church of God.
[time=2593] And in that field there are wheat and there are tears and the interesting dynamic between wheat and tears is you can't recognize the difference.
[time=2601] It's impossible to know the difference and so there are inside the church, the strong evangelical church, people who basically are born again through faith and Christ.
[time=2611] There are in their very midst tears and they talk the right language and they say the right things and they make the right professions and they function like everybody else and the point of the parable is you'll look at them and you don't know who's who.
[time=2624] You don't know who's really saved and who's not really saved that's impossible to make the distinction. You know where those tears come from? Matthew 13, 38, the tears are the sons of the evil one and the enemy who sowed them is the devil.
[time=2640] This is the ministry of Satan and his demons to bring into the church tears, people who profess Christ, who look like they know Christ, who have all the evidences on the external appearance of things to be believers and in fact they're not.
[time=2654] And what do you say, well what does that do? That does a lot. They fracture the church, they're not really born again, they don't have the cause of Christ bound up in their heart and so they find things to disagree about and argue about and they fracture and tear down the very work of Christ from within the church.
[time=2668] Some of them will take positions of leadership and then propagate false doctrine and hope to lead the whole church astray.
[time=2675] Others of them will become identified with a particular church which really preaches Christ in the community, everybody will know that person goes to that church and then eventually that person will become apostate, they'll deny Christ, they'll go back into a sinful lifestyle and destroy and hamper and ruin the testimony of that church.
[time=2692] So that really is the agency of Satan and his demons. It's not the overt demon possession that is as prevalent in the broad sense of the word around the globe today.
[time=2702] There are pockets of that where demonization really thrives and dominates a particular area but the vast portions of the world today are not inflicted with that. It is instead these idols in Deuteronomy 32-17, these demon doctrines of 1 Timothy 4, the blinding of the mind of the unbelieving, 2 Corinthians 4, and then even within the church itself, tears that will come and fracture the unity and the cause and the mission of the church.
[time=2730] Now there is the question of exorcism. What are we to do with demon possessed people? What are we to do when we encounter people that are demon possessed? I don't know if that's ever happened to you, it's never happened to me knowingly.
[time=2743] I know people who have come into contact with demon possessed people, people who when they speak to them will eventually have a radical transformation of their personality, they'll have a different tone in their voice.
[time=2753] There's a total shift, a radical shift in what's going on there and it's obviously demon possession. I have a friend who has dealt with demons and cast them out. What is our view on that? Where are we to land on that?
[time=2767] What does the Bible say about exorcism? Well first of all, the Bible makes no explicit command for the believer to go to the unbeliever and cast out their demons.
[time=2777] You would find no biblical authority that we should be involved in that ministry. Some churches have a ministry of exorcism. Some churches have an elder of demon possession. Some churches have a whole ministry set up to find, identify and help people who are demon possessed.
[time=2792] Well come with me to just three perspectives here as we wrap this thing up. Acts chapter 19. In this passage you've got some Jewish exorcists, some guys that aren't believers but they're involved in the exercising of demons.
[time=2808] And they are noticing the remarkable miracles of Paul. Remember Acts 19, verse 11, "God was performing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul so that handkerchiefs or aprons were even carried from his body to the sick and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out."
[time=2825] And these Jewish exorcists are seeing this and they're going, "Man, we've got to get in on this action." Verse 13. But also some of the Jewish exorcists who went from place to place attempted the name over those who had the evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus saying, "I assure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."
[time=2844] In other words, they thought it was some formula. They thought that the real cure to this problem was getting the name of Jesus in their little casting out exercise.
[time=2854] Well look what happens. Verse 14, "and seven sons of one Skiva, a Jewish chief priest, were doing this." Verse 15.
[time=2863] And the evil spirit answered and said to them, "I recognize Jesus and I know about Paul, but who are you?" Verse 16, "And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them and subdued all of them and overpowered them so that they fled out of the house naked and wounded."
[time=2880] Verse 15, "Point one, exorcism does not decipher down to a formula of words that you can say and then be effective in exorcism." You're saying, "Well those guys weren't saved." Right. Come to Matthew 17.
[time=2895] Here's a bunch of saved guys. Here are the disciples themselves with the power and the authority of Christ immediately given to them over spirits.
[time=2903] These very same men that we're going to look at in Matthew 17 have effectively and successfully cast out demons in other situations. But they come to this one and nothing happens.
[time=2914] Matthew 17, 14. And when they came to the multitude, a man came up to him, falling on his knees before I'm saying, "Lord have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic and he is very ill, for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. And I brought him to your disciples and what?"
[time=2932] They couldn't cure him. They couldn't do it. I brought him to your disciples implicitly because I'd seen them doing that with other people.
[time=2941] They were capable of that. Verse 17, and Jesus answered and said, "Oh unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him here to me."
[time=2952] And Jesus rebuked the demon and the demon came out of him and the boy was cured at once. Now verse 19. Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Hey, why could we not cast it out? What happened?"
[time=2965] And Jesus said to them, "Because of the littleness of your faith, for truly I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, move from here to there and it shall move."
[time=2976] Nothing shall be impossible to you, now verse 21. But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting. Prayer and fasting, the Bible teaches that there are different levels of wickedness inside demons.
[time=2992] Some demons are more wicked than others. And so one we learned that this is not reduced to some formula where you include the name of Jesus and find success.
[time=3001] Secondly, we find even among those that had been casting out demons, there are some demons that don't come out, except as he says by prayer and fasting.
[time=3010] I would remind you of Jude chapter 9, or excuse me, Jude verse 9, where Michael is disputing with the devil over the body of Moses. You remember what he says?
[time=3020] Now this is Michael. This is the super angel. This is the spiritual stud of the universe. This is the guy that God sends when he really has the power on the line.
[time=3028] Now Michael says, I don't rebuke you, the Lord rebuke you. Michael himself shows an incredible sense of respect for the power of Satan.
[time=3040] So it's not a formula. Even the disciples couldn't cast out some of the demons all the time. And I'll give you another thought on this.
[time=3050] Do you realize that sometimes God sends demons to do his bidding?
[time=3055] Sometimes God says to demons, demons, you go over there and you torment that person for me.
[time=3060] Psalm 78.49, God is punishing the nation of Israel, and it says there he sent a band of demons among them.
[time=3071] They are on his bidding there. In 1 Kings 22, God led wicked Ahab to death through the mouth of a lying spirit.
[time=3078] It was God's initiation. God performed that. In Revelation 16, it'll be the demons that lead all the rebellious armies of the world to the place of their own slaughter.
[time=3089] Armageddon. They are led there because God wants them there, and the demons lead them to that place so that the end of the age can culminate according and exactly to his plan.
[time=3099] So what I would suggest in this notion of demon exorcism is that there is a lot of cautioning reality in the word of God about just rushing into a situation or being taught some theory or some program or some ministry of exorcism.
[time=3117] And for the reasons I've cited not the least of which is God may have that demon there for a particular purpose, and to try to cast him out would be to act and direct opposition to the will of God in that case, and we would not know.
[time=3132] It's fascinating, isn't it? This is a whole side of spiritual warfare and a side of reality that is just overwhelming in its scope and power.
[time=3143] As I was studying this this week and I regret, you know, I can only expose you to a certain percentage of what I read and think about all week, but there were two things as we conclude that I wanted to share with you as I thought about these demons.
[time=3155] First of all, notice this. These demons used to be angels. They used to be God's holy angels. They used to be pure and righteous and just. They used to love what is good.
[time=3170] There was a time in history when these very demons being angels, if they would have been exposed to the kinds of things, the dumbness and the mutation that goes on and the lepercy and all the things that could come out of them, the nudity and the living in tombs and driving people into the desert and all the cursings of the name of God, they would have been horrified at it.
[time=3192] Now it's their greatest delight. What took them from righteousness to unrighteousness? What took them from being the holy angels of God to being the angels of the devil? One thing.
[time=3205] A choice not to have God's will supreme in their life. That's it. That one simple choice moved them from being pure and righteous and beautiful to being ugly and sinful and defiled and grotesque.
[time=3224] Do you realize, though, we could never be transferred out of the kingdom of his beloved son back into the kingdom of darkness? That you and I every day face the same choice to accept the will of God for our life.
[time=3238] And when we pursue the will of God for our life, there is a practical sense in which we are beautiful before God and we are useful and we are helpful and we stand for what is right and we pursue godliness.
[time=3253] And on a practical level when we choose not to have God's will prevail in our life, we become ugly and grotesque and sinful and we work against the cause of Christ.
[time=3265] Now again, nothing could change the status or our position in Christ where we are forgiven of all sins past, present and future. So there's a real sense in which we're always beautiful to God. But practically the same choice that was theirs is ours.
[time=3279] And I'll guarantee you that when we choose against the will of God for our life, then the strife and the anger and the enmity and the destruction of people we love will come.
[time=3291] Motivates me to say yes to God's will for my life. Secondly, this really is overwhelming. Do you realize that God has made no provision for their salvation?
[time=3305] God has made absolutely no provision to forgive Satan and his demons.
[time=3315] The only thing God has prepared for them is hell. Matthew 25 says the lake of fire was prepared for Satan and his demons.
[time=3324] There is no grace. There is no salvation. There is no second chance. There is no way out. God has made absolutely no provision for them other than eternal damn nation.
[time=3339] And when that strikes my heart, I realize that for some reason he made some kind of provision for me and it overwhelms me.
[time=3348] I am no more worthy of the plan of salvation and the person of Jesus Christ than are those demons. They were angels. They were precious in the sight of God.
[time=3358] He made them with his own words of his mouth. He knew and still does know them by name. I am overwhelmed with the thought that for some reason God chose to make a way of salvation for the human race and he didn't for the demonics, the demonic race, the demons and Satan.
[time=3382] And also the end of it all, the thought that Satan and the demons and then all the unbelievers who have ever lived and died outside of Christ.
[time=3393] They are all going to end up in the same place, not the abyss, but the lake of fire.
[time=3407] Thank you for tuning into the Bible Hour today. This was the second in the series of messages on Satan and demonism by our pastor teacher Russell Moore.

[time=3422] Just before we close today, if you've never accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior, you can do that by bowing your heads and asking him to come into your heart. Let's pray that prayer together.
[time=3433] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3440] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart and be my savior. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3449] In Jesus name I pray, amen.
