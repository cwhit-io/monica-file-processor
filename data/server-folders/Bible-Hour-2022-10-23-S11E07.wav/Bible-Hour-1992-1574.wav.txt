[time=0] This is a book that reveals to us the person of Jesus Christ in His glory, in His Second
[time=9] Coming.
[time=10] And John can't believe that he is receiving this information.

[time=566] Today I have as my guest in the studio, Steve Longbrake.
[time=569] Steve is the administrator of Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=572] Steve, welcome.
[time=573] We are glad you are here.
[time=574] I am glad to be here too, Pete.
[time=575] Well, our major purpose in having you on today is just to kind of share with the people, the activity of our new school building, education building for the church and the school.
[time=585] We are going to look at some footage right now, and I want you to kind of just bring us up to date on things that are happening as it relates to Black Hawk Christian School.
[time=592] We are beginning right now with just the floor of the orchestra area where we will share that with our Christian school.
[time=599] Yes, that is the south entrance to the new building.
[time=601] There will be a foyer there, and then that leads right up to the orchestra room where students during the week will be able to be in there for school, and then also our church will be able to use it on Sundays and also weeknights.
[time=611] This is an interior shot of the new building.
[time=612] You cannot see much yet because the lighting is not so good, but a lot is going on.
[time=616] Wall panels are being put up on the exterior above the block, and just a lot of real exciting
[time=622] action taking place out there at the building site.
[time=624] This is real recent footage.
[time=626] We have people that are going to be making our exterior look as good as it can in the future.
[time=632] That is going to all be grass and pretty, I hope.
[time=634] Right now it looks like a tornado hit up, but I know they know what they are doing out there with the block and the drywall that is available.
[time=640] Steve, that is an area where we enter that has direct relationship to the school and to your area.
[time=645] Yes, that will be the school office entrance.
[time=647] The area that we are looking out right now will be an air lock, and in a large room there will be a place for a cafeteria.
[time=653] Here is an exterior shot of the classroom area.
[time=655] There is windows all along that.
[time=656] It is going to be beautiful for the students inside, and then here is a place where we will be providing warm food for students during the day and some storage, and that attaches to the gymnasium area.
[time=666] This gym does not look like much right now, but it is going to be a beautiful place with a beautiful wood floor, and bleachers on both sides will seat 1,200 people.
[time=674] Up above the locker rooms you can see some space up there.
[time=677] The wall panels are not up yet, but that is a place where air hand worship will be taking care of our warming needs there in the room, and then we will have some weight lifting going on up there.
[time=686] I love to look at this gym and think about how many kids are going to be in there buzzing around and enjoying that space.
[time=691] We need this building because we are trying to double track our school by the year 1999, and we have already started that kindergarten through fourth grade.
[time=698] We have two of every grade level, two classes, and we hope to have that for our entire school and get it up to 750 students.
[time=704] Here is a nice shot of the exterior of the building again.
[time=707] I am really excited about what this building can do for us as a school and a church.
[time=711] The ten classrooms there will be used by our church to begin to increase the number of adult ABFs that we can have and get a bunch of those started on this side of the street now instead of walking across the street every Sunday.
[time=723] Really exciting for us to look at that building.
[time=725] Well, Steve, you mentioned something significant because I think this is really important in this day and ages.
[time=729] We talk about being frugal with the Lord's money that we have doubled the facility use.
[time=736] For instance, on Sunday mornings we will be very full with all of our adult Bible studies in these classrooms, and yet during the week it will not just be empty, but there will be plenty of kids in these classrooms, and I just think that's a great use of God's facilities and of the monies that He's given to us to use as good stewards.
[time=756] I agree.
[time=757] That's one of the things I've loved about Blackhawk from the first day that I came here is we really make use of the facilities that He's provided for us.
[time=763] They're utilized every day.
[time=764] Well, I hope that brings you up to date on some of the things that are happening as we build this new building, continue to pray for us and continue to pray for the Bible hour.
[time=773] And God will use this work to encourage people and strengthen their Christian lives.
[time=797] How can they believe something they have never heard?
[time=811] How will they feel His love that's waiting?
[time=818] Lord, I want to go so that they can know those who call upon the Lord will be saved.
[time=848] Today, I pass them on the streets, empty hearts and empty eyes I see.
[time=860] Each time I don't go away, I don't know what to say, I tell myself tomorrow is another
[time=876] day, it's funny, tomorrow's never seemed to come, and good intentions fade away like
[time=890] they've been sung.
[time=892] I close my eyes and pray, I see them everywhere, and wonder if they'll ever know how much you
[time=905] can see.
[time=909] How will they know unless we tell them?
[time=917] How can they believe something they have never heard?
[time=925] How will they feel His love that's waiting?
[time=932] I want to go so that they can know those who call upon the Lord will be saved.
[time=949] Today's the day they need to hear His voice, we need to go so that they can have a choice.
[time=965] We cannot contemplate, no time to hesitate, tomorrow may be to wait, to wait, oh, oh,
[time=985] how will they know unless we tell them?
[time=995] How can they believe something they have never heard?
[time=1003] How will they feel His love that's waiting?
[time=1009] Lord, I want to go so that they can know those who call upon the Lord will be saved.
[time=1047] [AMEN] Beautifully done and beautiful words.
[time=1052] If you have your Bibles this morning, let me invite you to take them and turn to the book of Revelation.
[time=1062] And after much prayer and thought as to where we might head, having finished 1 Timothy and
[time=1070] then the series on Satan, Demons, and Spiritual Warfare, I was continually drawn back in my
[time=1077] heart to the book of Revelation.
[time=1082] Chapter 1 verse 1 says, "The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave Him to show His
[time=1093] bondservants, the things which must shortly take place, and He sent and communicated it
[time=1099] by His angel to His bondservant John." I don't know about you, but I have spent some time in my life anxiously awaiting the arrival of important people.
[time=1111] My earliest memories of that are when I was about in the second or first grade, we lived in Glendale, California, my dad.
[time=1119] I would often wait his arrival home.
[time=1122] He was a salesman, and so I didn't know exactly what time he'd be coming home because oftentimes it was very different from day to day.
[time=1129] But I can see in my memory myself jumping up on the couch that was against the wall that approached the window that looked out on the mountain street, getting up there on my knees kind of resting my arms up there and just waiting for Dad.
[time=1141] In fact, I can remember my mom joining me on that couch on several occasions because she too was anxiously awaiting his return, and we would begin to guess how many more cars would go by before it was Dad's car.
[time=1156] And I was anxious for his arrival because I knew that once he came, things would be drastically different.
[time=1161] It was my dad's practice on it as a general rule to come in the house, change his clothes, put on the old jeans and the old sweatshirt, and then we'd hit the floor and wrestle a good part of the night away or we'd play games or we'd do something fun, at least that's how my memory has it.
[time=1177] I remember another time waiting anxiously for the arrival of Heidi.
[time=1181] Now I met Heidi when she was in the fourth grade, so I can't say that I waited a long time, but as some people do, waiting for God to reveal who their mate will be.
[time=1191] But I very distinctly remember the wedding day, our wedding day, and we had structured our day in such a way that we didn't see each other before that great spectacular moment when she turned the corner in all of her glory and that beautiful white gown and sparkling
[time=1205] eyes and tear-filled eyes, as I remember, but just waiting for her to turn the corner and realizing that what was going to transpire in the next few minutes was radically going to change my life for the better for the rest of my life, and it indeed has done that.
[time=1219] And the more I get to know her and love her and experience her, the more grateful I am for God's blessing, me with the arrival of Heidi.
[time=1229] And then I think of a delivery room when we were expecting our first child, and it's
[time=1235] not that I didn't anticipate all of them, but there was something, I guess, maybe you share that, that it was unique and maybe frightening and scary about what was actually going to happen on the first child, and in my day and age, they really encouraged Dad
[time=1248] to go right on in there to the delivery room and be a part of that whole experience.
[time=1252] And so I followed my orders and in fact got so excited throughout the course of developments they nurse actually had to tell me to be quiet or I had to leave, which probably doesn't surprise a lot of you, but, you know, and then suddenly there's Randy, and they bring
[time=1268] her over to me immediately and I get the holder and be a part of that wash process before it goes back to, she goes back to be laid with Heidi there and her breast, but just looking at Randy and realizing now that you're here, things are dramatically different.
[time=1284] My life will never be the same and it hasn't been, and it's been improved with each new child as they've come along, and you know how that is, expecting the arrival of someone
[time=1295] special.
[time=1297] The book of Revelation is written by a man named John, as you've noticed in the first verse.
[time=1303] And John is expecting the arrival of someone special, in his case, and I hope in our case
[time=1309] the arrival of Jesus Christ.
[time=1312] John is an old man by the time he writes this book, and John has seen a lot of things happen
[time=1318] under the title of Christianity, the way as it was called.
[time=1324] He has to this date walked and talked and lived with Jesus for some three and a half years in his public ministry, this is the apostle whom Jesus loved, this is the one who laid
[time=1335] his head upon the breast of Jesus, this is the one who wrote the gospel of John all about
[time=1341] Jesus, the most, the preeminent gospel that would present Christ that people might believe in Jesus Christ and have eternal life.
[time=1349] This is the same John that wrote the books of first, second, and third John.
[time=1355] These happened earlier in his ministry.
[time=1357] Now he is old, 80 or 90 years of age, he hasn't seen Jesus for 60 plus years and things have
[time=1364] really changed even since Jesus left.
[time=1369] John somehow survived the great persecution of Nero and he left Jerusalem and spent the
[time=1377] remaining 30 years of his life in Ephesus or Asia Minor and probably the Church of Ephesus
[time=1384] because that was the leading predominant church in that part of the world.
[time=1390] But it became hostile to him as it did all for all Christians who were under the domination
[time=1397] of the Roman Empire because Rome finally gave way to emperor worship.
[time=1402] Not of those who had lived and died but of the emperor who was alive and reigning at that particular time in history.
[time=1409] And in order to talk about the emperor, to write the emperor, to write about the emperor, to address the emperor in person, it had to begin with my Lord and my God.
[time=1422] And those words John could not say because John already had a Lord and a God and it was
[time=1433] not the emperor of Rome.
[time=1436] It was Jesus and because he refused to say those words to a mere man and count him anything
[time=1445] other than what he was, a mere man, John was exiled.
[time=1452] John was put in prison.
[time=1453] John was put to the island of Patmos.
[time=1457] You can see it in verse 9, "I, John, your brother and fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus was on the island called Patmos because
[time=1467] of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus." And he means volumes there when he says because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
[time=1479] What he means there is everything I saw in that marvelous person by the name of Jesus who walked and talked and lived with me for so many years and spoke messages and truth I had never before heard in my life and who performed miracles all over the land of Palestine
[time=1498] and could heal any disease at a whim and cast out demons and change a loaf of bread into
[time=1504] enough to feed literally thousands of people and a man who more than those miracles performed the miracle of changing my life.
[time=1512] John knew he was different because of Jesus.
[time=1518] John knew that he would never be the same because of Jesus.
[time=1524] He says the word of God and the testimony of Jesus and the testimony of Jesus the remembrance that the tomb was empty and that Jesus as he had predicted would die but three days later would rise again and so he did and John saw the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ with nail
[time=1540] pierced hands and feet and a wounded side.
[time=1546] There was nothing that anyone could ever do to John to bring about his uttering the words
[time=1554] my Lord and my God to anyone other than Jesus and so he is exiled to Patmos.
[time=1563] He is at the end of his life and he doesn't know anything that is contained in the book
[time=1571] of Revelation, he knows little or nothing about all that is going to be told to us in
[time=1578] the weeks to come.
[time=1581] At best he has heard from the prophet Daniel book he must have read several times and studied through Daniel 2 28 however there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and he made
[time=1591] known what will take place in the latter days.
[time=1594] John would have studied about the golden image of Nebuchadnezzar and the stone that was cut out without hands that destroys all the earthly kingdoms and sets up its own kingdom the kingdom of the Messiah.
[time=1605] But that would have been very masked, it would have been very confusing, there would have
[time=1611] been far more unanswered questions than answered questions in his mind having made that study.
[time=1619] John would have been there on the Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24 and following when Jesus used the same little phrase the things which must take place and went on to describe some of the signs of the end of the age.
[time=1632] But there again he would have known little about the graphic detail of how this whole
[time=1638] world system comes to an end and how Christ will ultimately reign supreme over all of it.
[time=1644] As you and I would know little were it not for the book of Revelation.
[time=1649] And John is so overwhelmed by the fact that he is receiving this information, look again
[time=1655] at verse 9 he says I John, he says that four times in this book over and over again he
[time=1662] makes declaration or explanation of the fact that I can't believe this is me, I'm the one
[time=1671] receiving this incredible information about how this whole world system runs to an end and finally holds.
[time=1678] You remember that John in the Gospel of John never set his own name once, refused to identify
[time=1686] himself.
[time=1688] But here in this book he can't help but identify himself because it comes without thought it just must come, I John your brother, fellow partaker in the tribulation and kingdom.
[time=1703] This is ultimately a book about Jesus Christ.
[time=1710] And if in your English Bible you see the title The Revelation 2 John, note this, that was not inspired, there's nothing wrong with it, it just happened to have been added later.
[time=1720] The best title for this book is found in the first three Greek words of the Greek text in our Bible the first five words the revelation of Jesus Christ, that's what this book is.
[time=1731] This book is a revelation of Jesus Christ, Apokolips, Yezu Christu in the Greek, Apokolips,
[time=1739] Apo, a prefix meaning to take away, to remove, Apokolips to cover.
[time=1747] So it is to remove the covering, it is to take away the covering, it is a disclosing of what has been concealed here to for unknown.
[time=1757] In this case because it's the inspired Word of God it is a disclosing of divine truth about Jesus and the end of the age.
[time=1767] Five times this book calls itself prophecy, it is a fourth telling of what will come.
[time=1776] And it centers in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1782] In Genesis we read of the commencement of heaven and earth.
[time=1788] In Revelation the consummation of heaven and earth.
[time=1792] In Genesis the entrance of sin and the curse.
[time=1795] In Revelation the end of sin and the curse.
[time=1800] In Genesis the dawn of Satan and his activities.
[time=1803] In Revelation the doom of Satan and his demons and their schemes.
[time=1808] In Genesis the tree of life is relinquished.
[time=1811] In Revelation it is regained.
[time=1814] In Genesis death enters, in Revelation death exits.
[time=1817] In Genesis sorrow begins, in Revelation sorrow is banished.
[time=1824] In Genesis paradise is lost.
[time=1826] In Revelation paradise is regained.
[time=1830] In Genesis a Savior is promised, in Revelation the Savior is preeminent.
[time=1839] This is all about the blessed Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1842] In fact you can outline the book around the person of Jesus Christ, would you turn the page to chapter 1 verse 19?
[time=1851] And whenever you study the Bible you will read a book several times over and over and over and over and over again to get the feeling and the flavor of it and you look for verses such as verses 1-19 because it is a hint from the author of his organization of the
[time=1867] material and that becomes very valuable when you attempt to study it.
[time=1871] Chapter 1 verse 19 right there for the things which one you have seen and two the things
[time=1878] which are and three the things which shall take place after these things.
[time=1885] In other words write what you have seen past tense, write what is and write what is to come and if you'll go back and that's what we'll do this morning by way of introducing the book to ourselves you'll find that Christ is the preeminent one in all three categories
[time=1901] of the book.
[time=1902] It begins with the things which you have seen.
[time=1907] You can find a great description of it in verses 12 and following, follow along as I read.
[time=1914] And I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me and having turned I saw seven golden lampstands and in the middle of the lampstands one like a son of man clothed in a robe reaching
[time=1925] to the feet and girded across his breast with a golden girdle.
[time=1929] And his head and his hair were white like white wool like snow and his eyes were like
[time=1936] a flame of fire and his feet were like British bronze when it has been crushed to glow in
[time=1942] a fire.
[time=1943] And his voice was like the sound of many waters and in his right hand he held seven stars and out of his mouth came a sharp two edged sword and his face was like the sun shining
[time=1954] in its strength.
[time=1957] That's what Jesus looks like today.
[time=1959] If you could see Jesus today like John saw Jesus as he was exiled on island patmos and
[time=1966] was given vision by God to see Jesus that is the descriptive.
[time=1972] That is who he is.
[time=1973] So the first part of this book describes the things which you have seen and we could call that the glory of Christ.
[time=1979] This vision depicts the glory of Christ.
[time=1983] The second category of this book is described as the things which are.
[time=1988] And that picks up in chapters two and three and this is a tremendous expose on the body
[time=1994] of Christ, the church, the church of Christ.
[time=1998] And you'll find in these two chapters seven churches listed.
[time=2003] Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
[time=2011] These are seven actual historical churches that were in Asia Minor and they are in clockwise
[time=2018] order beginning at Ephesus and moving around the horn until they return back to Ephesus.
[time=2025] Ephesus is obviously the lead church because it was the most prominent but these are the churches in Asia Minor and in this section of the Word of God which relates to the here and now which by the way we are still involved in, the present.
[time=2037] The Lord who is depicted in this marvelous vision in chapter one moves through the seven lampstands or the seven churches that are described here and he analyzes the church.
[time=2048] And to each church he gives commendation.
[time=2051] This is what is right about you.
[time=2052] This is what you have done that is noble.
[time=2054] This is what we would emphasize.
[time=2058] And then where needed he gives condemnation to churches that have fallen in certain areas and have given up vital and crucial things to the cause of Christ.
[time=2069] And that will be to our benefit in weeks ahead as we study each of these seven churches and we will find that our church will take shape in one or parts of these churches.
[time=2080] And we will be listening to his commendation and we will also be listening to his condemnation as we would find it fitting.
[time=2088] It's also true that these seven churches are types of seven people.
[time=2094] Different ones of us inside this one church will be more inclined to be described by one
[time=2101] of these churches than the other.
[time=2104] And we will listen to that in a very personal way as well.
[time=2108] But just for this morning I want you to follow with me as we go through chapters two and three and listen to the names of Christ at the beginning of each letter to the church.
[time=2115] There is a description of this marvelous one who is the preeminent one.
[time=2120] Chapter two verse one, he is called the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven golden lampstands.
[time=2129] In verse eight he is called the first and the last who was dead and has come to life.
[time=2138] In verse 12 he is the one who has the sharp two edged sword and he says this.
[time=2146] In verse 18 he is the son of God who has eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are
[time=2152] like burnished bronze and he says this.
[time=2156] In chapter three verse one, he who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars
[time=2162] says this.
[time=2165] In verse seven, he who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens and no
[time=2171] one will shut and who shuts and no one opens, says this.
[time=2177] And then in verse 14 he is called the all men, the faithful and true witness, the beginning
[time=2183] of the creation of God says this.
[time=2188] And so before the church is analyzed first the description of the one who analyzes it our Jesus, our preeminent Lord, the one who has the right to analyze and either condone
[time=2198] or condemn behavior and patterns and characteristics.
[time=2205] So the book of Revelation begins with a great vision of Jesus Christ and then shows him moving
[time=2211] in and through the seven churches and then comes the last portion of this book and we
[time=2219] could call that the plan of Christ and it runs from chapter four all the way to the end in chapter 22.
[time=2225] The glory of Christ, chapter one, the body of Christ, chapters two and three and the plan of Christ verses four and following.
[time=2234] And I want to suggest to you that who you will meet here by the name of Jesus, he will look distinctly different to you than you remember him in the manger.
[time=2244] He will look vastly different to you than you remember him moving in and through the streets of Jerusalem and the land of Palestine with his mercy and his grace and his forgiveness
[time=2256] and his empathy and his understanding and his patience and his long suffering.
[time=2262] You will meet a completely entirely different Jesus in these remaining chapters.
[time=2268] Let me introduce him to you.
[time=2272] It begins a great dramatic scene in chapter five and there is a man weeping for there
[time=2279] is a great problem.
[time=2281] Chapter five verses one and following and I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a book written inside and on the back sealed up with seven seals and I saw a strong
[time=2291] angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals
[time=2299] and no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to
[time=2306] look into it.
[time=2308] And I began to weep says John greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or
[time=2314] to look into it and one of the elders said to me stop weeping behold the lion that is
[time=2322] from the tribe of Judah the root of David has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals that's Christ.
[time=2331] Christ is the lion that is from the tribe of Judah the root of David and so he performs
[time=2338] like a lion he is fierce he is destructive he is powerful he is swift he is overcoming
[time=2349] this book that is to be opened with its seven seals and it's seven trumpets and it's seven
[time=2356] bowls these are the three waves of great judgment that Christ will bring upon the earth.
[time=2365] And what I want you to understand this morning is that this is not the wrath of God this
[time=2371] is the wrath of the Lamb what we are going to cover here in the next few minutes is descriptive
[time=2378] not of the wrath of God the Father but the very wrath of Jesus Christ that he is going
[time=2385] to meet out on this planet for failing to accept to acknowledge a hymn as sovereign
[time=2391] God and King.
[time=2394] In chapter six the seals begin to be opened and it begins with cold war in the first few verses then open destructive violent war then famine then death then martyrdom of the saints
[time=2405] and then now six verse twelve follow as I read and I looked when he broke the sixth
[time=2413] seal and there was a great earthquake and the sun became black black as sackcloth made
[time=2421] of hair and the whole moon became like blood and the stars of the sky fell to the earth
[time=2427] as a fig tree cast its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind and the sky was split apart
[time=2434] like a scroll when it rolled up and every mountain and island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and free man that's everybody they hid themselves in the
[time=2449] caves and among the rocks of the mountains and they said to the mountains and to the rocks fall on us and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath
[time=2460] of the Lamb for the great day of their wrath has come and who is able to stand Jesus Christ
[time=2473] begins to meet his wrath out upon the earth and in chapters eight nine ten eleven the
[time=2481] wrath comes in the form of trumpets as they are sounded and we find there that a third
[time=2487] of the earth's vegetation is destroyed and a third of the ocean life is destroyed and
[time=2495] a third of the fresh water of this planet will be destroyed and a third of the sun and
[time=2501] the moon and the stars will be darkened personally I don't understand how life goes on after
[time=2508] that but it does the Bible says it does and then he moves from there does our Lord to
[time=2514] chapter 16 and more wrath is coming and terrible sores fall upon all those who followed the
[time=2525] antichrist and there is then a total poisoning of all the salt water on the earth and then
[time=2533] a total poisoning of all the fresh water and then a fearful and blistering heat from the
[time=2539] sun with nothing to quench the thirst for it is all gone to salt and then read yet yet
[time=2548] another picture with me in chapter 16 verses 17 and following and the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne saying it is done and there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peels of thunder and there
[time=2563] was a great earthquake such as there had not been since man came to be upon the earth so great an earthquake was it and so mighty and the great city was split into three parts
[time=2574] and the cities of the nations fell and Babylon the great was remembered before God to give
[time=2581] her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath and every island fled away and the mountains
[time=2588] were not found and huge hailstones about one hundred pounds each came down from heaven upon men and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail because its plague was extremely severe this is it this is absolute devastation the wrath of the lamb is felt
[time=2611] in chapter 17 you find the Lord's destruction of the false religious systems of the world
[time=2618] and for those of us who preach on a weekly basis and stand against air it is a breath of fresh air to know that that will finally just collapse on itself and come to an end and deceive people no more and in chapter 18 we find the end of the world's political
[time=2637] and economic structure and its systems and then in chapter 19 we find all the military
[time=2646] might of the world assembled in the valley of Armageddon against this great awesome Jesus
[time=2653] look at it in 19 verse 17 and I saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud
[time=2666] voice saying to all the birds which fly in mid heaven come a symbol for the great supper of God in order that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men both freemen and slaves and small and great he's assembling the birds of heaven
[time=2686] to eat up the carnage that he will just soon bring verse 19 and I saw the beast and the
[time=2694] kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against him who sat upon the horse and against his army and the beast was seized and with him the false prophet who performed
[time=2705] the signs in his presence by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image these two were thrown alive into the lake of fire which
[time=2715] burns with brimstone and the rest were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of him who sat upon the horse and all the birds were filled with their flesh.
[time=2731] Turned out of chapter 20 there ended all the people of the earth there ended all the
[time=2738] rebellious people of the earth but here would be the end of the rebellious one verse 10
[time=2747] and the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are also and they will be tormented day and night forever
[time=2758] and ever and then he brings everybody back from the dead.
[time=2768] Verse 11 it wasn't enough that he should kill them now he will judge them eternally.
[time=2776] Verse 11 and I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it from whose presence earth and heaven fled away and no place was found for them and I saw the dead the great and the small standing before the throne and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books according to their deeds and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death
[time=2801] and Hades gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged every one of them according to their deeds and death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire this is the second death
[time=2813] the lake of fire verse 15 and if anyone's name was not found written in the book of
[time=2819] life the lamb's book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2828] It is what men have done with the person of Jesus Christ that will determine their eternal
[time=2834] destiny and their deeds will reveal that in fact they did not accept him as Savior they
[time=2842] did not submit to his lordship they did not honor the word of God they did not walk in humble dependence in the presence of the great lamb of God and though they are destroyed physically
[time=2854] by him they are not done with him until it is concluded what they have done with him in their hearts spiritually morally before God and everyone who has ever lived who has not
[time=2867] put their faith in the God of the Old Testament and the promise of the Messiah or the Jesus
[time=2873] Christ of the New Testament one in the same will suffer eternally away from the presence
[time=2885] of the glory of God tormented day and night forever and ever in the lake of fire this
[time=2893] is a book all about Jesus all of these judgments are about Jesus and his holiness being violated
[time=2906] and with the closing of that chapter 20 then the whole scenario changes drastically and
[time=2912] in chapters 20 and 21 we are introduced into the eternal state.
[time=2917] We are brought into the very presence of Christ and of God to spend forever and ever in glorious
[time=2923] union and harmony and fellowship those whose names were found in the book of life are taken
[time=2929] into this eternal bliss and it is a conscious state it is a relational state it is a state
[time=2938] in which we will reflect and enjoy the very person himself Jesus Christ verse 1 of chapter
[time=2946] 21 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and there is no longer any sea and I saw the holy city the new Jerusalem coming out of heaven from God made ready for a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying behold the tabernacle of God is among men and he shall dwell among them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be among them and because
[time=2970] of that verse 4 he shall wipe away every tear from their eyes and there shall no longer be any death there shall no longer be any mourning or crying or pain the first things
[time=2981] have passed away behold verse 5 I am making all things new verse 6 I will give to the
[time=2996] one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost verse 8 but for the cowardly
[time=3003] the unbelieving and abominable in murders and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters
[time=3010] and all liars their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death I will tell you something this is a different Jesus same Jesus but a
[time=3027] different Jesus Jesus Christ once left heaven for earth in humiliation the next time he
[time=3034] leaves heaven he will come in exaltation the last time he left heaven he came to be killed
[time=3044] the next time he leaves heaven he will come to kill the last time he left heaven he came
[time=3050] to serve the next time he leaves heaven he will come to be served the last time he left
[time=3059] heaven he came to offer mercy and grace and forgiveness the next time he leaves heaven
[time=3065] he will come to demand justice the last time he left heaven he came to seek and to save
[time=3072] those who were lost the next time he leaves heaven he will come to search and destroy
[time=3079] those who are lost it will be different come back with me now as we close just to the
[time=3091] first chapter again
[time=3103] this is the only book in the bible that opens and closes with a promise of blessing first
[time=3111] three blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it for the time is near blessed it's a beatitude there are seven of them in this book blessed are you who read that's the public reading of the
[time=3127] scripture as we have been doing with its attendant application and explanation blessed are those
[time=3133] who hear meaning that you receive it you accept it as true the word of god and blessed are
[time=3139] those who heed it who obey it and all three of those verbs read and hear and heed are
[time=3149] all present participles meaning continuous action of your life this is a book that is
[time=3155] to continually being read and heard and obeyed you say why because the time is near see the
[time=3163] in the verse three because the time is near time is the word kyros it means epochs eras
[time=3169] great periods of history what he is saying is this is the next event in god's prophetic
[time=3177] calendar so many years ago the first event was creation and then the Lord brought about
[time=3185] about his next event the flood and then it was the calling of Abraham and the establishing
[time=3192] of the nation of Israel and the great exodus out of Egypt and bringing them to the promised land and finally it was the great event of the birth of Jesus Christ and that worked its way inextricably to the death of Jesus Christ and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the ascension of Jesus Christ but all those are now in the past as is the coming of the spirit
[time=3213] of God and the advent of the New Testament church at Pentecost everything is in the past or the very present but the very next thing to happen is in verse seven behold he is coming
[time=3231] do you hear the present tense of that verb he is on his way it is the next event nothing
[time=3238] else needs to happen except for Jesus to come back and he will come back and he will come
[time=3246] back in the glory and the power and the awesomeness that he is described in this book and we
[time=3253] are blessed to read it to hear it and to obey it let me close with this one thought written
[time=3265] by John Phillips one of the most stirring passages in English history tells of the conquest
[time=3273] and crusade of Richard I Richard the lion hearted while Richard was away trouncing
[time=3280] Sullivan his kingdom fell on bad times his sly and graceless brother John usurped all
[time=3287] the prerogatives of the kingdom and misruled the realm the people of England suffered
[time=3295] longing for the return of their king and praying that it might be very soon then one day Richard came he landed in England and marched straight for his throne around that
[time=3306] glittering coming many tales are told woven into the legends of England one of them is
[time=3312] the story of Robin Hood John's castles tumbled like nine pens great Richard laid claim to
[time=3319] his throne and none dare stand in his path the people shouted their delight they rang
[time=3325] peel after peel on the bells the lion is back long live the king the day is coming when
[time=3336] a king far greater than Richard will come to lay claim to a realm far greater than England
[time=3345] those who have abused the earth in his absence those who have ceased to live under his authority
[time=3355] and have mismanaged his world will be swept aside they will be destroyed by the wrath
[time=3362] of the lamb and only those who love him and bow down the knee to his sovereignty will
[time=3371] have any share in his kingdom John began the book with great exclamation behold I John
[time=3384] and having heard it all and having seen it all in these great visions which were given to him he heard these final words he who testifies to these things says yes I am coming quickly
[time=3397] to which John added a men come Lord Jesus I hope that the bible hour has been a special
