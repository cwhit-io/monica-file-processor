[time=0] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=86] We know about the joy that comes to us through the privileges we have here soon we'll have the freedom of voting as we would want to what a privilege
[time=96] that is the freedom to decide our career to decide where we live the freedom to worship openly as we are right here in this very moment we have a lot of joy that comes through the provisions we have food to eat a choice of clothes to put on today perhaps a choice of which modes of transportation to use to get here so much provision we have to say nothing of all the spiritual privileges
[time=121] and provisions that are ours as well as a second Peter chapter 1 verse 3 says everything necessary for life and godliness have been freely given to us and what a joy that is but there's another source the privileges and the
[time=137] provisions all come in the same package with problems or let's intensify a
[time=143] little bit further and say persecution because that is a tremendous source of joy
[time=149] welcome to the Bible hour an hour of Bible study music and fellowship which we
[time=165] hope you will find to be an encouragement thank you for joining us in Pastor Moore's absence we are privileged to have as our special guest speaker pastor Jay Letti Jay is the pastor of Northwest Community Church of Phoenix Arizona previously Jay and Russell served together on the staff of Grace Community Church our special music today will feature the sanctuary choir and
[time=189] Silawis Brian Losen let's now join our service
[time=219] [MUSIC]
[time=249] I mentioned in the first service that often I don't say much about the choir
[time=268] number we just allow the words to penetrate your heart and I hope that you listen to that message but the title of the song today is called I am determined and just a challenge to all of you that as we know Jesus Christ as our personal Savior we we need to be reminded again as we will be certainly in our message today that God saves us and he protects us but he doesn't always take away all the hurts and all the problems that we have but we do need to ask Christians serving in this world for him need to say that I am invincible and
[time=300] I am going to remain determined until he's finished the work that he has for me to do I don't think that'll be our challenge today and to all of you as you listen to this song entitled I am determined
[time=334] [MUSIC]
[time=364] for the King I am determined to be invincible till he has finished this
[time=380] purpose in me when nothing shall shake me or never forsake me I am determined
[time=396] to live for the King
[time=404] [MUSIC]
[time=408] yes it's our trembling from saints prayers ascending darkness is crumbling from
[time=421] praises we see
[time=445] [MUSIC - 364 seconds]
[time=827] [APPLAUSE]
[time=833] Well what a privilege it is to come into your home again and to share with you the Bible hour the ministry of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=843] Our pastor Russell Moore is gone to Jamaica he's visiting some of our missionaries there and I'm sure in subsequent programs we will be updating you on some of the ministries that we support in that area of the world.
[time=857] Our pastor J. Letty is the pastor of the Northwest Community Church in Phoenix, Arizona.
[time=865] I'm really excited about his topic today as it relates so closely to the music that we're singing today.
[time=873] You heard the choir sing and the main theme in that song was "I am determined to be invincible" until he has finished his purpose in me.
[time=881] I like to challenge all of you that we need to be determined to live a Christian life that's honoring to the Lord.
[time=887] Even today as I think of Isaiah 40-31 in the scripture says "they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.
[time=895] They shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary. God can give us the strength to live the Christian life."
[time=903] And then Chuck Swindall says "Aim so high you'll never be bored. Let me read this to you." He says the greatest waste of our natural resources is the number of people who never achieve their potential.
[time=915] Get out of that slow lane, shift into that fast lane. If you think you can't, you won't. If you think you can, there's a good chance you will.
[time=925] Leaving making the effort will make you feel like a new person. Reputations are made by searching for things that can't be done and doing them.
[time=934] Aim low, boring, aim high, soaring. I hope this is your intent in life as you know Jesus Christ is your personal Savior that you'll be determined to live that Christian life for him.
[time=947] As we look ahead to next Sunday I want to remind you that Dr. Robert Provost will be with us and giving us a report on his ministry in Russia.
[time=956] He's been there for a number of months now and will be coming back to tell us what's going on as it relates to the Christian ministry in that country.
[time=965] So join with us. Our pastor will be speaking to us and then Robert Provost will be giving us that special report next Sunday.
[time=974] And if you're watching the Bible hour today on November 1st in the Sunday evening program we're going to have a special musical guest Brenda Whitfield.
[time=982] Brenda is from right here in Fort Wayne, Indiana has joined us before with our music and as a marvelous testimony and song exciting person and you'll enjoy her music.
[time=993] So if you're watching come November 1st at 6pm right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1000] Then some of you have been hearing about the living Christmas tree and I know that every year people call in about tickets.
[time=1008] I want to take just a moment and tell you a little bit about the program and how it works.
[time=1013] The concerts start on December 11th. That's a Friday evening at 7pm and then they go Saturday December 12th at 3pm and 7pm and December 13th at 3pm and 7pm.
[time=1029] And then we jump to Friday December 18th at 7pm, December 19th at 3pm and December 20th at 3pm and 7pm.
[time=1041] Public distribution for the living Christmas tree tickets is on Saturday November 14th.
[time=1046] Here's how this program works. You come on a first serve basis and receive a number and each person that comes can receive up to 8 tickets for the program of their choice.
[time=1056] Now obviously we only have a certain amount of tickets and so they will be distributed until they're gone and if they happen to be gone at 3 o'clock then we'll just close up shop.
[time=1066] But that's on November 14th from 9pm until 5pm.
[time=1071] And then I want to tell you about a book that is called Christ in Christmas, a family Advent celebration.
[time=1077] This is a book that I want you to write for early on so that you can use the four Sundays before Christmas to have special moments about the coming of Jesus Christ.
[time=1088] You can receive this booklet by writing to the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=1099] I know it's a little early to be talking about Christmas but write for this booklet today so that you can have it for the four Sundays prior to Christmas.
[time=1108] We go back now to our regular service.
[time=1127] So we give you first place until we let you begin to fill us with your spirit.
[time=1146] We knew what's wrong with it.
[time=1156] So we're going to have a look at the book.
[time=1185] Live our lives to show you all the love we owe you.
[time=1198] We're seekers of your heart.
[time=1217] Because your heart was broken, because you saw the need.
[time=1237] Because of gallery, we can now be called your own.
[time=1256] We, creations, filled with you alone.
[time=1270] Lord, we want to know you, live our lives to show you all the love we owe you.
[time=1289] We're seekers of your heart.
[time=1297] Lord, we want to know you, live our lives to show you all the love we owe you.
[time=1317] We're seekers of your heart.
[time=1341] Lord, we want to know you, live our lives to show you all the love we owe you.
[time=1516] Later that day, the store manager called Russ aside and said, Russ, that was a really quick thinking on your feet there earlier today.
[time=1524] And I want you to know, we're looking for men with good leadership abilities like that.
[time=1528] And to bring it to management, would you be interested in pursuing that?
[time=1532] And Russ said, well, yes, I think I would.
[time=1534] And the manager says, well, you need to know now that the management training center is in Minnesota.
[time=1539] And Russ said, Minnesota, all that's in Minnesota are ugly women and hockey players.
[time=1545] And the manager says, well, I would have you to know my mother lives in Minnesota to which Russ responded.
[time=1551] Or really, which team does she play on?
[time=1559] Now, if you believe that story, I also have some land in Arizona.
[time=1563] I'd like to sell to you.
[time=1566] Today, I would like to talk with you about one of the most overlooked sources of joy.
[time=1572] An area of joy we don't even think about.
[time=1575] We know about the joy that comes to us through the privileges we have.
[time=1578] Here soon, we'll have the freedom of voting as we would want to, what a privilege that is.
[time=1584] The freedom to decide our career, to decide where we live, the freedom to worship openly as we are right here in this very moment.
[time=1592] We have a lot of joy that comes through the provisions we have.
[time=1595] Food to eat, a choice of clothes to put on today.
[time=1598] Perhaps a choice of which mode of transportation to use to get here.
[time=1603] So much provision we have to say nothing of all the spiritual privileges and provisions that are ours as well.
[time=1611] As a second Peter, chapter 1, verse 3 says, everything necessary for life and godliness have been freely given to us.
[time=1619] And what a joy that is.
[time=1621] But there's another source.
[time=1623] The privileges and the provisions all come in the same package with problems.
[time=1630] Or let's intensify it a little bit further and say persecution.
[time=1634] Because that is a tremendous source of joy.
[time=1637] And today's passage, if you want to join me, it's in 1 Peter chapter 4.
[time=1641] And in 1 Peter 4, the passage is going to show us that to our surprise, hardships, suffering, persecution is a tremendous source of joy that can be known as no other source.
[time=1656] If we really understand what Christ is doing in those moments, suffering and hardships can be understood as either a threat or a promise.
[time=1664] 1 Peter 4, verse 12 through 19, will help us realize the promises that come with the problems that bring a tremendous source of joy for you and me.
[time=1678] In his insightful book, The Problem of Pain, C.S. Lewis said this about the role of trials in our lives.
[time=1686] "I am progressing along the path of life in my ordinary, contentedly fallen and godless condition, absorbed in a merry meeting with my friends for the moral, or a bit of work that tickles my vanity today, a holiday, or a new book, when suddenly a stab of abdominal pain that threatens serious disease, or a headline in the newspaper that threatens us all with destruction, sends this whole pack of cards tumbling down.
[time=1712] At first I am overwhelmed, and all my little happinesses look like broken toys, then slowly and reluctantly bit by bit, I try to bring myself into the frame of mind that I should be in at all times.
[time=1727] I remind myself that all these toys were never intended to possess my heart, that my true good is in another world, and my only real treasure is Christ.
[time=1738] And perhaps, by God's grace, I succeed, and for a day or two become a creature consciously dependent on God and drawing its strength from the right resources.
[time=1749] But the moment the threat is withdrawn, my whole nature leaps back to the toys, just showing how trials, afflictions, the very things that keep us focused on what's most important for our life.
[time=1765] Let's begin our investigation into 1 Peter 4, verse 12 and 13, we see the perspective we need to understand.
[time=1772] Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing, as those some strange things were happening to you.
[time=1782] But to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing, so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may rejoice with exaltation.
[time=1794] Starts off. Beloved, don't be surprised. And the grammar implies that they were already surprised. They didn't see as part of the deal that they had to go through hardship.
[time=1805] The should have known it. Jesus made it very clear in John chapter 15. He says, "If the world hates you, you know that it hated me first."
[time=1814] And if you were the world, the world would love it so, but because you are not of the world, because I chose you out of the world, the world hates you.
[time=1823] And in that great prayer to his Heavenly Father, before he goes to the cross, in John chapter 17, he says to the Father, "I've given him your word, and the world hates them."
[time=1835] John 313 makes it explicitly clear, "Do not marvel, brethren, if the world hates you. It's a part of the deal."
[time=1844] In fact, Jesus said, "To not only plan on it, but to also be assured that when it happens, it'll result in blessings."
[time=1852] Matthew 5, verse 11, "Blessed are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil against you falsely on account of me. You will be blessed."
[time=1866] Now the apostles all became convinced of the guarantee of hardship and the blessings that could be theirs as a result.
[time=1873] That's why every one of them, Peter, James, Andrew, John, all of them offered the empathy to us and shared that good news with those around them.
[time=1882] But keep in mind, as we come to first Peter 4, we are now dealing with a second and perhaps even a third spiritual generation.
[time=1889] And though they've heard those teachings, they need to develop that personal experiential reality for their own heart and soul.
[time=1897] Now in our generation, we have a different circumstance. It seems that the most prominent presentation of the gospel of Christ says that if you believe in Jesus, all of your problems will go away and you'll have happiness from then on, you'll be healthy, you'll be wise.
[time=1915] And the problems just don't fit in our contemporary view of Jesus, so it seems.
[time=1920] We have a generation with an extremely low tolerance of sacrifice and suffering. We tend to see it as contrary to the successful Christian experience.
[time=1929] It doesn't fit in if I'm having problems, if there's a friction, something's wrong with my Christian experience.
[time=1935] However, if I understand the New Testament clearly, it seems to be saying to me that without Christ, we are spiritually bankrupt and are facing an eternity of suffering.
[time=1947] But, if we'll give our life to Christ, we will suffer here for a little while and then know that eternal place where no longer would there be any suffering.
[time=1956] Well, here Peter describes a hardship in verse 12 as a fiery ordeal among you.
[time=1961] He introduced that thought in chapter 1, which we'll look at later, but perhaps the reason he described their suffering as a fiery ordeal is because of the historical conditions at that time.
[time=1971] Nero is the emperor of Rome, and you'll recall the event of Rome having been set on fire. Soon it became highly suspicious that Nero was the one that set it on fire.
[time=1982] He wanted somebody else to blame, he turned to the Christians, and he said, "It's the Christians who did it."
[time=1988] And so, through that fiery ordeal they were persecuted, or he may have in mind the fact that when Nero put on his very plush garden parties to provide lighting through the night, he would take a Christian and impale them on a pole, dip them in pitch, and then place them around his garden and light the flame to them, and their very bodies were the torch of flame to light him for the garden parties.
[time=2010] That would certainly be the ultimate of a fiery ordeal that Christians could face. But either way, verse 12 makes it very clear as to the purpose of their fiery ordeal.
[time=2020] It says, "It comes upon you for your testing." Now, what is the test? What does it prove? Well, in school, how do we know whether we've learned the lesson or not?
[time=2031] We've got to take the test, don't we? And the test qualifies us. If we pass the test, we've qualified, we've learned the lesson.
[time=2039] You see, we can say we're committed to the principles of God's Word, but devotion to the principle can only be measured by our willingness to suffer for it.
[time=2049] An example, I could ask you what you believe about abortion, and providing you adhere to the teachings of Scripture, you would tell me that you realize abortion is wrong.
[time=2059] But do you know how we'll know what you really believe about abortion? It'll be when someone near and dear to you is pregnant with an unwanted child, and then we will find out what you believe about abortion.
[time=2070] We say we don't like divorce, and that divorce is not good, but we'll find out what you believe about divorce, when your marriage is at a stage of great struggle and difficulty, then we will know.
[time=2082] You say you believe in Christian fellowship and how important it is, and yes, we must assemble ourselves together, and we must stimulate one another to love and good deeds, but let me look at your schedule and see the consistency of that participation.
[time=2094] And I'll tell you what you really believe about Christian fellowship. We say we believe in the gospel, the good news of Jesus Christ, the answer to all of our problems, the thing that will save America.
[time=2105] But when you have a very open opportunity to declare Jesus Christ as someone who is very receptive, and you don't do it, you're saying what you really believe about the good news of Jesus Christ, you see hardship reveals genuine Christianity, and compromises will not stand the test.
[time=2124] That's why in James, it states that we will encounter various trials which will result in testing our faith, which will result in producing endurance, which will result in deep moral character. You see it's part of the process.
[time=2136] So here in 1 Peter 4, verse 12, it says, "Do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for testing, as though some strange thing were happening to you."
[time=2147] God wants to separate genuine faith from superficial faith, and suffering is a key means to do so. Verse 13 says, "Instead of being surprised, if we truly understand what is going on in the process, there's something else we should do.
[time=2163] To the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing." Now, it's not saying, "Rejoice because you're suffering." There's no fatalistic attitude here at all.
[time=2174] No, if you look closely, it's saying, "Rejoice because you are suffering for him." That's the issue.
[time=2181] Now, I could walk you through the books of the New Testament, and I think without exception, show you passages where they make it very clear to identify with Christ is to also identify with suffering, and to identify with that suffering is to bring you a source of joy, passage after passage.
[time=2198] But just back up with me to 2 Corinthians, chapter 4, if you would please, and let's look at that one, at least, and you'll see the tenure that runs throughout the entire New Testament.
[time=2208] 2 Corinthians 4, let's begin with verse 8. It gives a very vivid description and a variety of ways that that suffering could come to us.
[time=2219] 2 Corinthians 4, verse 8, "We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed, but not despairing, persecuted, but not forsaken, struck down, but not destroyed, always caring about in the body, the dying of Jesus."
[time=2237] That the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body, for we who live are constantly being delivered over to death, for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh, so death works in us, but life in you.
[time=2252] Do you see it there? Identifying with Christ, and every time the hardship and the suffering and the persecution come, a greater opportunity to identify with Christ and show the reality of Him living in and through us, whereby others too may know that.
[time=2266] May know that same source of life. On the way back in 1 Peter, stop off at chapter 1, because Peter in this epistle introduced this subject very early, because it kind of permeates the entire epistle.
[time=2278] 1 Peter, chapter 1, and let's start at verse 6. And here's where he ties in the rejoicing that comes with the suffering.
[time=2287] In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire may be found a result in praise and glory and honor of the revelation of Jesus Christ, and though you have not seen Him, you love Him, and though you do not see Him now, but believe in Him,
[time=2314] you greatly rejoice with joy in expressible and full of glory. He says, if you really understand what is going on, if you really understand who Christ is to you in that moment, if you really live true to Him in that very time you have, you will begin to see a sense of joy you have never known before.
[time=2334] Now on to chapter 4, back to verse 13. Very important reminder here in verse 13, first the right response to suffering on behalf of Christ is to keep on rejoicing.
[time=2345] It's a privilege. You see, He wants suffered for us. He did it openly and freely. He suffered for us, and now that He's at the Father interceding for us, we are here to represent Him and we suffer for Him. What a privilege that is.
[time=2360] But do you see in verse 13 the other reason we should be rejoicing is sort of like double dividends. Not only for the joy of living for Christ now, but it says when Christ appears, there will be total ecstasy for those who are faithful to Him.
[time=2378] In verse 13 to the degree that you share the sufferings of Christ, keep on rejoicing so that also at the revelation of His glory you may rejoice with exaltation. You've started a pilgrimage into the book of Revelation with Pastor Russ.
[time=2393] You're going to get to chapter 6 where over that period of time so many, many people gave up their life for the name of Jesus Christ. They were martyred and taken into God's very presence.
[time=2404] Standing around the throne of God in Revelation chapter 6, and they stated this holy God, God how long can this go on on earth, how long can men despise you, and thumb their nose at you and go on their own way, and nothing be done about it, and those will stand true to you or put to death, how long will that go on?
[time=2424] And the response is more yet to die. Finally, chapter 18, judgment is pronounced and all of the wrath of God is declared over the unrighteousness upon earth, and then in chapter 19, it's the hallelujah course of Revelation went all of heaven, births forth with great rejoicing, and they're excited to see that God's character is held in high esteem, and His righteousness will prevail on earth, and His holiness will be honored.
[time=2453] And to the degree we are willing to suffer for Christ now is the degree which we will be elated in eternal glory when Jesus Christ is honored in righteousness.
[time=2466] So the perspective we see in verse 12 and 13 is that a proper response to suffering produces great rejoicing. Now in verse 14 to 18, there's some principles that help carry that out.
[time=2478] Verse 14, if you are reviled or if we read it as it would be in the Greek, we would say, since you are reviled, the word reviled means to be publicly shamed, to be rejected by society, but the key is the next phrase, since you are reviled for the name of Christ.
[time=2495] Now I've noticed some seem to think there's some magical power in the name of Christ, and they go around saying Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, as though that's some source of blessing.
[time=2504] That's not the idea in Scripture. When it speaks of the name of Christ, it's talking about His character and His cause, and when you're reviled or you're publicly belittled for standing for the character of Christ and for the cause of Christ, that's being reviled for the name of Christ, and that's the issue all the way through Scripture.
[time=2523] You'll see in Revelation 2 and 3 when you're soon there in the churches, those faithful churches that God commends, He says to each of them, you have endured for my name's sake, you have not denied my name, that's the issue.
[time=2539] Now look at the very life of the Apostle Paul, at that moment he was converted on the road to Damascus, and the message came to him saying, I will show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake.
[time=2550] Now look at Barnabas and Saul in Acts 15, and when they were described, they were described as men willing to risk their lives for the sake of the name of Jesus Christ, and to every one of us who does the same verse 14 declares, if you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed.
[time=2567] Notice it doesn't say you will be someday blessed. No, right then, that very persecution is a sign of being blessed, you are standing true to Christ, and His honor is upon you in that moment.
[time=2580] And that's the first principle, blessings come with allegiance to Christ. The music of the morning is shared that with us so beautifully, hasn't it?
[time=2588] Determined to be all that Christ has enabled me to be. Now our natural thinking is the opposite. You see we say, God, if you will bless me, then I'll commit my life to you and live for you.
[time=2603] Now the Lord says, no, no, it doesn't work that way. You commit your life to me, and I'll begin blessing you.
[time=2608] And one of the richest and immediate blessings is described in verse 14, the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. The spirit of glory emphasizes the manifestation of God, when it mentions of God that emphasizes the very essence of God, and the fact that it rests upon it shows us His very presence in our life.
[time=2627] And all of this adds to say to us, when we stand true to Christ's name, to the point of suffering for it, God's presence and God's provisions will be more real to us in that moment than any other time there is.
[time=2640] And if you'd like a greater sense of the intimacy of Christ and your heart and life, if you'd have a greater sense of His provisions flowing your way, my friends stand true to the name of Jesus Christ, don't be ashamed of Him, stand for Him, and you will begin to understand what His presence really means, and you'll begin to see His provisions coming your way to meet your every need.
[time=2663] The second Corinthians 417 says, our momentary light of friction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison.
[time=2675] You share His sufferings now, you will know His presence and provisions now, you will also know greater glory in the future.
[time=2683] And the more difficult it is, the richer God is towards us. I think of Stephen, Acts chapter 15, stood true to Christ all the way, and they're listening to him preach, and once again He declares the name of Jesus Christ, and they stand there with stones in hand, if He daresay as the word Jesus Christ, they will put Him to death.
[time=2704] He doesn't have to take one moment, and it says there in Acts 15, as they looked in His face, they stood in amazement, because it says they saw His countenance like the face of an angel.
[time=2716] You see because He was standing in the pressure and the suffering of the moment true to the name of Christ, He knew God's presence, and He knew God's provisions in a way that even illuminated His very countenance.
[time=2728] And that's not unique to Stephen, anyone in history, anyone today who will stand true to Christ will know the reality of His peace and His presence with them.
[time=2739] First, 15 gives us an important reminder, unless we come to some wrong conclusions, not all suffering is met with the blessings and presence of God. It says by no means that any of you suffer as a murderer thief, and I think you're using extreme examples here to make a very vivid point.
[time=2755] He mentions also being an evil deuer to include all sorts of evil, and then he throws in one to show it includes even the things we may not consider readily, when he says, "Trouble some meddler." That's just one that gets involved in other people's affairs, they're not part of the problem, they're not part of the solution, they're just a self-appointed committee to go straight not everything.
[time=2773] He says, "Now you'll suffer for that, but don't think you're going to be blessed because of it. You may suffer for evil. Don't think you're going to be blessed because of it."
[time=2781] He uses these examples to point out that we may be bringing suffering on ourself by our own misconduct, and there's no joy in that suffering for us.
[time=2790] Verse 15 reminds us that suffering must be evaluated. Is it a result of standing true to Jesus Christ, or is it simply my pride, and I think I'm suffering because my name has been injured, or my comforts have been infringed upon a little bit, or my self-centeredness has suddenly been challenged.
[time=2810] So that's why I sense this suffering. That doesn't bring any blessings and provisions of God, but to stand true to Christ, we have the assurance of He's with us in it.
[time=2820] Verse 16 gives further insight, "If our suffering is as a result of knowing Christ, if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed."
[time=2829] Did you know the name Christian was given to believers in derision? They were trying to find ways to belittle the Christians, and so they started calling them Christians.
[time=2838] Before that, they were known as disciples, or believers, or people of the way, that one way in Christ.
[time=2845] And I mentioned earlier, Nero's treatment of the believers, a historian of that day named Tacitus said this, "Nero substituted as culprits, and punished with utmost cruelty, a class of men whom the crowd styled Christians."
[time=2861] A term of belittlement, but do you know what the believers did in that day? They said, "Anyway, we can identify further with Christ where ready to do so."
[time=2870] You want us to call us Christians? "Hey, we'll take that name. It could withstand for Christ any moment like that." As a result, to declare oneself a Christian led to suffering, and in fact in AD 110, it was illegal to even call oneself a Christian.
[time=2886] So when it says if anyone suffers as a Christian, it means you will gladly identify with Jesus Christ no matter what social reflection that will put upon you.
[time=2894] If anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed in the grammar shows that this is referring to one who has begun to feel ashamed, and says, "Don't do that."
[time=2903] One day Jesus Christ went naked to the cross publicly on your behalf. He was not ashamed of you. He stood for you on that cross unashamedly.
[time=2914] And they belittled him, and they mocked him, and they laughed at him, and they spit in his face, and they punched him until you couldn't see the figures of a man.
[time=2921] He was never ashamed of you or me, and now we're here to suffer for him. Why should we be ashamed of him?
[time=2929] Instead it says, "But in that name let him glorify God." Now remember, this is being written to us by the Apostle who personally denied the Lord three times while he was going through that suffering.
[time=2947] And so it tells you and me that even if we have been ashamed to identify with Christ, there's hope for us. We can start from this moment and from now on purpose in our heart. We will not be ashamed of Jesus Christ. We'll stand true to him.
[time=2960] And we'll take care of the reputation of the name of Christ and let him take care of our reputation. We can learn to constantly stand for the Lord.
[time=2969] To do so we must understand the principle in verse 16, and that is the objective is not our popularity and peace, but glorifying God.
[time=2977] What does my commitment say of how glorious our Savior is? Is he worthy of public identification? Is he worthy of me to stand up and be counted for the name of Jesus Christ, where I work and where I live, and the people I associate with, and my social circles?
[time=2990] Is Jesus worthy? Is his glory worthy enough for me to say so? That's the challenge. And guess what? Do you know how the Lord's strengthens our commitment to stand true to him, suffering?
[time=3004] Another dose. C.S. Lewis went on to say in that quote I mentioned earlier, "Thus the terrible necessity of tribulation is only too clear. God has had me for about 48 hours and then only by dent of taking everything else away from me."
[time=3019] Let him, but she that sword, the sword of afflictions, for a moment, and I behave like a puppy when he hated the bathwater, the hated bathwater is over.
[time=3029] I shake myself as dry as I can and I race off to re-acquire my comfortable dirtiness, if not in the nearest manure heap, at least in the nearest flower bed.
[time=3038] And that is why tribulations cannot cease until God either sees us remade or sees that our remaking is now hopeless.
[time=3047] You see it's a part of the package. Blessings through provisions, blessings through privileges, all packaged in affliction, in suffering, in standing true to the name of Christ, but from it, tremendous source of joy.
[time=3060] It leads us to the point of verse 17 and 18, "God has plans for the disobedient, first for believers who might attempt to claim him, but not openly identify with him at any cost."
[time=3069] It says in verse 17, "It is time for judgment to begin with the household of God." You see, God deals with those who bear His name.
[time=3077] He doesn't elaborate on this because He did that in chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3. Of course, He says, "Don't be conformed to your former last." He says, "Live in an excellent way."
[time=3086] And says, "Sanctify Christ as Lord in your heart. Keep a good conscience." And then this is in verse 17, "And if it begins with us first, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?"
[time=3098] Verse 18 states it another way, "If it is with difficulty that the righteous are saved." In other words, we're saved from our unfaithfulness, we're saved from compromising, the suffering forces us away from that.
[time=3109] There's no such thing as a secret saint. You see, genuine faith always rises to the surface in hardship.
[time=3115] And so, although difficulty is the reality of commitment for the believers, what will become of the godless man in the sinner?
[time=3123] And again, he doesn't answer this because if you look back in chapter 3, verse 12, he told us, "It says the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
[time=3131] That's what will happen to them. But there's all leads us to verse 19. You see, we can have the right perspective.
[time=3138] We can see the principles of how it works, but there's got to be a plan of action. And verse 19 tells us what it ought to be.
[time=3144] Therefore, let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful creator in doing what is right.
[time=3153] Remember where we started, verse 13, "God wants us to have a sense of continuous rejoicing."
[time=3159] He then clarifies that a rejoicing comes as a result of an open commitment to Christ ready to suffer any consequences for his namesake.
[time=3167] Now we see how to get it started. It says, "Intrust your soul." Same term Jesus used on the cross.
[time=3174] When he looked towards heaven and he said to his Heavenly Father into your hands, "I commit my spirit, same term, to commit to trust."
[time=3185] It means to hand over something valuable to the care of another, and you have nothing more valuable than your own soul.
[time=3192] And if you entrust your soul to God, you are also entrusting your reputation, your future, your abilities, your relationships, all those things you want so much to protect.
[time=3204] And want to make sure that you don't be seen as weird and strange being a Christian, and you're always protecting that.
[time=3210] But Lord says, "Hey, unequivably, you entrust yourself to Him. You take care of God's reputation, and you let Him take care of yours. He can do a far better job of it."
[time=3222] But notice to whom you're entrusting yourself, a faithful creator. Do you know this is the only place in the New Testament where God is called by the name Creator?
[time=3231] He takes us all the way back to our very existence. Each one of us uniquely made by God, each of our personalities molded by Him, and the God who created us knows us better than anyone else who better to entrust our soul than the very Creator.
[time=3247] And notice it says, "He's the faithful creator. He will never ever let you down. He will always be there. He will provide. He will give you the blessings you need in every single moment along the way."
[time=3258] Notice also, entrusting our souls is not just some passive prayer of commitment. It says, "We entrust our souls in doing what is right. Your commitment will be manifested by your action." That's what he's saying.
[time=3273] "I entrust your soul and do right. Follow God's leading. He will show you the opportunity. You do right in that moment. And as you do so, you will then begin to have that wonderful sense of His presence, the wonderful sense of His power upon you, and as a result, an extreme source of joy that you've perhaps never known before."
[time=3293] I'd like to close with a quote of Philipiancy from his book entitled, "Where is God when it hurts?" And here he's making an analogy of death to birth. And since the point he makes here, let me read it to you.
[time=3307] Each of our individual deaths can be seen as a birth. Imagine what it would be like if you had full consciousness as a fetus and could now remember those sensations.
[time=3319] Your world is dark, safe, secure. You are bayed and warm liquid, cushioned from shock. You do nothing for yourself. You're fed automatically. A murmuring heartbeat assures you that someone larger than you feels all your needs.
[time=3332] Your life consists of simple waiting. You're not sure what to wait for, but any chain seems far away and scary. You meet no sharp objects, no pain, no threatening adventures, a fine existence.
[time=3345] One day you feel a tug. The walls are falling in on you. Those soft cushions are now pulsing and beating against you, crushing you downwards.
[time=3356] Your body is bent double. Your limbs twisted and ranced. You're falling upside down. And for the first time in your life, you feel pain.
[time=3364] You're in the sea of roiling matter. There's more pressure. Almost too intense to bear. Your head is squeezed flat. Your pushed harder. Harder. Into a dark tunnel. Oh, the pain. No, it's more pressure.
[time=3376] You heard all over. You hear a groaning sound and an awful sudden fear rushes in on you. It's happening. Your world is collapsing. You're sure it's the end. You see a piercing, blinding light.
[time=3388] Cold, rough hands. Pull at you. A painful slap. And where? Congratulations. You have just been born. Death is like that.
[time=3399] On this end of the birth canal, it seems fearsome, portentious, full of pain. Death is a scary tunnel and we are being sucked towarded by a powerful force.
[time=3410] But put the analogy spiritually. We know from the Bible where to be dead to that old way of life and new way in Christ.
[time=3420] And it's scary to turn loose to the old ways, scary to launch out and entrust our soul to the Savior and let him work through us as we do what's right.
[time=3430] Won't you join me in prayer? And as we come to prayer, I trust you. Make this a solid solitude moment between you and the Savior.
[time=3442] And perhaps a simple prayer like this. If you've never entrusted your soul to Christ, won't you do so right now? Just simply say, Lord, I come to you just as I am.
[time=3454] I give you my soul. I give you my life. You died for my sins. I ask you to come and cleanse me of sin and bring me a life that I might live a whole new life for you.
[time=3467] If that's your prayer, that's the beginning. Christian, you're here. You say, I prayed that prayer a long ago. I gave my heart to Christ a long ago.
[time=3475] Are you ashamed of him? Are you willing to live for him now, today, in doing what's right? I pray that you are. Thank you, Lord, for challenging our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[time=3495] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour. I hope you enjoyed the music from our sanctuary, choir, and orchestra, and soloist Brian Losen.
[time=3503] The message today was from our special guest, Pastor J. Letty, from the Northwest Community Church in Phoenix, Arizona.
[time=3511] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3519] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that you allow me to come to you and tell you that I'm a sinner, that I've sinned against you, and I need you as my Savior.
[time=3529] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today. In Jesus name I pray, Amen.
