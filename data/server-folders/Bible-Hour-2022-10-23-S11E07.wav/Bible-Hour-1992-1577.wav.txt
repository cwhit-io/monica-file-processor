[time=0] men are weak and men make mistakes and if you're looking for the weakness and men you'll
[time=7] find it. All people at their best are weak in the sight of God.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. During Pastor Moore's absence, our Christian school administrator, Steve Longbreak, will be sharing with us from God's Word. His message entitled, "Our Role as a Christian, Discusses the Christian's Role in Today's World." We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it ready for today's message.
[time=58] Our special music today will feature a selection from the brass ensemble entitled, "Great Is Thy Faithfulness." And a solo from Margie Isaacson entitled, "I cannot tell." Let's now join
[time=75] our service.
[time=95] There's a choice that must be made and a time to take a stand.
[time=103] A time to lift his light as a beacon in this land. The fields are white for harvest.
[time=117] There's kingdom work to do. I answer Lord, your calling, and I give myself to you. As for
[time=132] me and my house, we will serve the King. No other gods before him, no other song to sing.
[time=147] Your name will be our shield Lord, our lives and offering. As for me and my house, we will
[time=161] serve the King on kings. Your song will be my anthem and your harmony my joy. Your music
[time=185] and my oasis, that no discord can destroy. My heart will sing your praises. Our toys
[time=198] will lift your name. I stand before you, Father, in your presence I proclaim.
[time=212] As for me and my house, we will serve the King. No other gods before him, no other song
[time=226] to sing. There will be our shield Lord, our lives and offering.
[time=237] As for me and my house, we will serve the King on kings.
[time=247] There's kingdom work to do. I stand before you, Father, in your presence I proclaim.
[time=267] I answer Lord, your name, and my house, we will serve the King. No other gods before him,
[time=281] no other song to sing. Your name will be our shield Lord, our lives and offering.
[time=293] As for me and my house, we will serve the King on kings. Your name will be our shield
[time=313] Lord, your name, and my house, we will serve the King. No other gods before him, no other
[time=333] gods before him, no other song to sing.
[time=363] Lord, your name, and my house, we will serve the King. No other gods before him, no other song to sing.
[time=674] [APPLAUSE]
[time=688] Hello, and thank you again for watching the Bible. I hope the music has already been an inspiration to you.
[time=694] We're getting into the holiday season with Thanksgiving, and then Christmas just around the corner.
[time=699] I hope that many of you are anticipating coming to the living Christmas tree. If you desire to come to some of the performances, you should call the church office immediately, because there are a limited number of tickets available.
[time=711] I want to give you that number. It's area Code 219-493-7400, and you should do that tomorrow morning, so that you may be assured of coming to the living Christmas tree.
[time=723] We're calling it White Christmas this year. I think you'll enjoy its presentation. And then I want to tell you about a gift offer that we have for this month entitled Christ in Christmas, an Advent Celebration.
[time=735] Now, an Advent Celebration is simply celebrating the coming of Jesus Christ, and there are four segments in this book where you can have special moments with your family, talking about Jesus Christ, coming into this world, the purpose for his coming.
[time=750] It's an excellent time for you and your family to get together once a week in the four weeks prior to Christmas.
[time=758] So I hope that you'll write for it. Just simply write to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=769] Just ask for the book Christ in Christmas. Again, the address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=783] In just a couple of weeks, those of you that are faithful members of the Founders Club and others of you that have given faithfully over the years to support our program financially will receive a letter in the mail telling you about the needs that we have at the Bible Hour.
[time=799] Our Bible Hour staff has spent a good deal of time trying to figure out all of the necessary needs that we have an equipment for our new year and we'll need some support financially to be able to purchase some of this equipment.
[time=815] So I hope that you'll be watching for that letter and you'll be prayerfully considering what you can do at this end of the year to support the Bible Hour in an additional way.
[time=824] Our pastor is not here today. He's in a seminar in Pittsburgh and you will be hearing shortly from our associate pastor, Steve Longbreak.
[time=834] Steve is the administrator of a Black Hawk Christian school. Also teaches one of our main Sunday school classes here at the church and really has a heart for God and you will want to stay tuned for his message today.
[time=848] So I hope the Bible Hour today gives you great confidence in knowing that God is here and that you will be encouraged by the music and the message from God's Word.
[time=858] We're going to go back to some music now and the message from our associate pastor, Steve Longbreak.
[time=866] I cannot tell why he who angels worship should set his love upon the sons of men.
[time=888] Or why a shepherd he should seek the wanderers to bring them back. They know not how or when.
[time=908] I cannot tell how silently he saw a fruit as with his piece he graced this place of tears.
[time=930] Or how his heart upon the cross was broken.
[time=942] A throne of thorns to three and thirteenths.
[time=952] This I know he heals the broken order and stays our scene and comes our lurking fear and lives the burden from the heavy laden.
[time=980] For yet the Savior save your love the world is here.
[time=1004] I cannot tell how he will win the nations how he will claim his earthly heritage.
[time=1022] Or satisfy the needs and aspirations of east and west of sinner and of sage.
[time=1042] This I know of flesh, shall see his glory and he shall reap the harvest he has found.
[time=1060] Hands and land he is and will shine his blamber when he will save your Savior of the world is known.
[time=1084] I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship when he's beating every stone his dearest.
[time=1102] Or who can save a greater jubilation when all the hearts of men with love are filled.
[time=1120] Like this I know the sky will thrill with rapture and cold as voices then will join to sing.
[time=1140] And earth to heaven heaven to earth will answer.
[time=1152] And last, the Savior save your love the world is here.
[time=1182] Thank you Margie and Scott.
[time=1192] I love to hear our music.
[time=1194] I like to hear music in my home on records and tapes and CDs and television and all that.
[time=1200] But I love it a lot more here because I know the people that are singing it.
[time=1204] The first service I was sitting down there and enjoying this song and the previous song by Pete.
[time=1212] And when Pete was saying about his house serving the Lord I was welling up inside.
[time=1220] I talked to him often about the fact that he and Carol are almost finished with a big part of their job.
[time=1227] Their youngest son is graduating this year from high school and they can look back and say we've been faithful to serve the Lord and nurture them in the truth and admonition of his word.
[time=1240] And we've accomplished something here.
[time=1242] So when he's seeing that I'm kind of getting teary eyed sitting there thinking I can't wait till I can say that.
[time=1247] I'm really worried about this thing.
[time=1249] Looking forward to those days when I can look back and say that part's over.
[time=1254] And as I'm thinking about him having the right to say that because I know him, Chuck Frederick leaned over and said Pete can say those words and mean every one of them.
[time=1264] What an encouragement both of us are sitting there thinking the very same thing.
[time=1268] That's fun for me to listen to people sing like that.
[time=1272] I'm really glad to be up here today for some reasons.
[time=1276] I'm glad Russell's in Pittsburgh. I've thought about that this week and Russell went to Pittsburgh for the weekend and you know he talks so much about California and the wonderful weather and all that stuff there.
[time=1288] When he comes back from Pittsburgh he's going to think Fort Wayne's a real heaven on earth I think.
[time=1296] I hope nobody's from Pittsburgh here.
[time=1300] Sorry I've hated the Steelers all my life so it's okay to say.
[time=1306] I have one more correction. I guess two more corrections to make.
[time=1309] One is two services in a row. Pete introduced this group that played up here as a brass ensemble.
[time=1315] If you didn't see that big baritone saxophone there I wanted to take note of that.
[time=1318] Doug was playing that woodwind. I love sax. I played that and I enjoyed that part of it.
[time=1323] So Pete you got to make sure you say baritone sax as well.
[time=1326] And then the other correction is a lot more fun.
[time=1330] The first service when Chuck did the announcements he said that there was Christianity 101 available and there's a gracious and godly man teaching Christianity 101.
[time=1341] And I know the teacher of Christianity 101. Bob Freiborn is godly but he's not gracious at all.
[time=1349] I want to correct that. I asked Chuck to be sure and say that again. He did. I'm really thankful.
[time=1360] Last week I had a chance to teach a wana and the lesson that I brought to a wana was a difficult one.
[time=1369] I'd heard Bill Archer teach it on our Wednesday night Bible study a couple of weeks before and it's about the fact that god heated, kept Adam and Eve from entering the Garden of Eden to eat of the tree of life because then they would have been separated from him on this earth forever.
[time=1397] And we would have inherited life and the actual physical death that we receive is a gift of God's grace because then we get to be with him.
[time=1411] I never thought of death that way.
[time=1414] We talk about being absent from the body and present with the Lord but hadn't thought about the fact that he graciously prohibited them from eating of the tree of life.
[time=1423] So I wanted to pass that on to our wana children. And you'd be surprised they usually can learn philosophical concepts more quickly than adults can.
[time=1432] They don't have the clutter. They just believe it's true when you tell it to them.
[time=1437] And so I said to introduce this whole subject I said to the wana girls in the third through sixth grade.
[time=1443] Think about what would be the worst thing that can happen to people. They're going to think about death killing that kind of thing.
[time=1451] I said if you went through Fort Wayne today or the United States and you said to people on the street what's the worst thing that happens to people?
[time=1457] What are they going to say? One little third-grade girl raised her hand she said Bill Clinton will be president.
[time=1465] A half of you are laughing. For the other half I want you to know that if she said George Bush will be president it would be just as appropriate.
[time=1474] Men are weak men are weak men are not fit to be president and if the truth were known if they'd had total freedom to say exactly what the truth is and still be elected based on their credentials.
[time=1489] I'm sure they would have been first to say we know it's a time of peace.
[time=1495] Presidents have very little authority when it's a time of peace and all of these measures that we'd like to implement in the United States can only happen if you and the Congress of the United States agree.
[time=1507] And you keep that Congress in and they pass this legislation and it becomes a law with our signature even without our signature if enough of them want it to be law.
[time=1516] But they can't say that because then we'd perceive them as weak but that's true.
[time=1524] Men even in Congress men and women who are legislating for us only have authority by the grace of God.
[time=1538] All of the presidents have had something bad said about them. When I was a child my first remembrances of president's names are just how bad FDR was for the United States.
[time=1551] And then I heard how bad Richard Nixon was for the United States. Different parties, totally different philosophy, both bad reputation among some people.
[time=1562] People presidents that seem to escape a lot of that ridicule or the ones that die in office. They're sort of immortalized for us there.
[time=1569] William Henry Harris in the most, he only served one month. What could he do wrong in that like the time?
[time=1575] He was blessed. At best, at our best, men are weak. And we make mistakes.
[time=1587] So in thinking that through as a Christian person first, as a citizen of the United States second, I've been trying to think through what's my role in response to the fact that men and women are weak and they'll make mistakes in government.
[time=1603] How do I respond to them? What am I supposed to do? How should I behave as a citizen of the kingdom and this nation's state, the United States?
[time=1612] I say a nation's state because the truth is nations are groups of people, large groups, that come together as a unit and perceive themselves to be a unit throughout history.
[time=1626] They're not necessarily governments. Nations are groups of people.
[time=1631] You ever thought about the fact that we're a part of the nation of Israel. We've been adopted into the chosen family of God, not the nation's state of Israel, the nation of Israel.
[time=1644] God made a nation out of those people. As a matter of fact, at the Tower of Babel, he first introduced different languages which really separated people often and forced them to become nations to a certain degree.
[time=1657] And then he chose his nation. He said, "This group of people I'm going to make for myself." And he covenated with Abraham to do exactly that.
[time=1669] I'm a Christian citizen in Fort Wayne, Indiana, United States, planet Earth. I can't go beyond that yet.
[time=1678] I'm an alien. I'm a stranger to the philosophies of this world. But I'm a citizen of this nation's state. How's that fit together? I want to know what my role is.
[time=1693] A nation's state is a group of people, large group, exactly what we described before, living as a unit, perceived to be a unit throughout history that also has their own land and their own government.
[time=1707] That's a nation's state. That's the United States of America. That's the nation's state of Israel today.
[time=1715] Israel wasn't always there as a nation's state. At one time it was just a nation, wandering. God was their only government and they had no land that they possessed at the time.
[time=1730] Eventually they possessed the land and then they were taken out of their land. And God, through his grace, gave them a place to live.
[time=1740] They defied God and therefore lost their land.
[time=1747] How to start our history as a Christian nation. I'm talking about the Black Hawk Baptist Church, the Christian Church of America, the Christian Church of the world, the Body of Christ.
[time=1758] How did that nation get its start? Well, it was God governing people directly. Like I said, first through Abraham and even Adam and Eve before that, then through Moses and the law, then through Jesus Christ Himself.
[time=1779] He told Adam and Eve, I'm your God. You're accountable to me. Don't eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Accountability came with the order and structure that God provided through government.
[time=1795] To Abraham, he said, I'm going to make a great nation out of you. You'll be my people, but you're accountable to me. This is how you'll be accountable. Every male will be circumcised. And you'll be recognized as a child of mine. You're my nation. They're accountable to Him.
[time=1813] He even made Noah accountable before that. He said, Noah, you're a man living for me, doing my well. Now you do this. You build an ark and get in it. That's an accountability.
[time=1827] Then he said, in Exodus chapter 20 to Moses, take this law down to the people. In Exodus 20, 21, 22, 23, it goes on. The law is listed there that would separate those people, that would set that nation apart, that they'd be a nation under God, chosen by Him to be His family, His people.
[time=1850] And to the extent that they were obedient to the law that God had granted them, they were blessed, they prospered, they defeated nations, they had no business defeating from a human perspective because God blessed them.
[time=1861] And when they defied God and said, we'll not keep your law, God then separated them and they were scattered around the earth, taken into captivity.
[time=1871] Our spiritual ancestors, those patriarchs lived in a theocracy, God directly ruling over them. And until 1 Samuel chapter 8, that was true.
[time=1888] So we ground them from the Persian Gulf all around the fertile crescent to Egypt, where city states that were set up and monarchs that have evolved in those city states to lead people and to prosper the people by attacking other city states that had been happening for years, hundreds of years.
[time=1910] Looked at those city states and saw how men were accountable to men and the great possessions they could take in that accountability to men, and the sin they were free to commit with that accountability to men, and they said to Samuel, you're dying, you're the last judge, your sons are no good and they weren't any good.
[time=1939] And in 1 Samuel chapter 8, they said, now appoint a king for us to judge us like all the nations.
[time=1948] They didn't want God to be their king anymore and remember what God says later in that chapter, do not grieve over this Samuel, they're not rejecting you, they're rejecting me.
[time=1958] The people of Israel rejected God as their king and wanted a human being to be a king.
[time=1964] And God said, warn them, tell them how bad that's going to be, that they still want a king, I'll give it to them, and they did, and he gave them Saul.
[time=1975] And since that day, they've been a nation state rather than a nation under God.
[time=1985] Why do people want to be accountable to men rather than God? I know why I do, he's there all the time, he's there all the time.
[time=1997] When my eyes are focused on people and what they know and what they want for me often, it's easier for me than what I know about God and what he wants for me.
[time=2008] Seeing people's eyes, people can say to me, sue a brother or sister in Christ, it's legal to sue believers in courts of law.
[time=2024] But in 1 Corinthians chapter 5, God's Word says, it might be legal, but it's not godly, it's wrong to sue a brother or sister in Christ, take it to the church.
[time=2035] People say, I need to be open-minded to weaknesses in people or preferences in people that I should accept homosexuality as an acceptable practice of preferences someone might choose.
[time=2054] The Bible says, in Romans chapter 1, it's sin, it's wrong, we need to declare it as so, just like we do lying, stealing, killing, everything else. It's a sin, we can't tolerate it, we can't accept it as a preference.
[time=2066] It may be your preference, but you aren't allowed to do it because God's Word says you are not allowed to do it.
[time=2074] People say, you can get a divorce if you have irreconcilable differences. God says, you can't get a divorce unless there's infidelity in the marriage.
[time=2086] Period. Humans believe they have rights and they want to protect them, and you can't find that in the Word of God.
[time=2101] We have a tendency sometimes, I think, to believe as Christian people that because the Declaration of Independence says that we are endowed by our Creator with certain and alienable rights, that among those are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that somehow that's in the Scripture, and that God provides us with life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and we're supposed to seek those rights that we have.
[time=2122] It's not in there. Nothing in the Scripture would support that.
[time=2127] Will we have life forever as a believer? Yes, not physically. Will we have liberty as a believer? No, thank goodness, we're going to be slaves to the Lord God Almighty.
[time=2143] Will we have the pursuit of happiness? Not on this earth. There are people that are God's chosen children who've done nothing but suffer from the day they were born until the day that they die, and He loves them.
[time=2156] Are they going to experience great happiness and joy, yes, they are, on this earth, not necessarily. It's not true, and yet sometimes we biblishize some things that we hear.
[time=2167] Now, I don't want to say that I'm opposed to allowing us to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I'm grateful that I am in a place where I'm allowed to do that, but it's not a right of mine as a human under God's authority.
[time=2185] Is it legal and godly, or is it just legal? Have you ever asked yourself that question?
[time=2193] Nations make laws, and we might make our decisions based on whether or not what we're choosing to do is legal.
[time=2202] I'd ask you to ask yourself, is it also godly? Is it also my responsibility to serve God and please Him by doing this deed, being free to do it?
[time=2214] The kings existed until captivity, until the nation of Israel was split up, scattered all over the world, and since then, the nation state has been reinstated in Israel.
[time=2236] And I believe with all my heart that we have an obligation as God's chosen children to be allies to the nation of Israel, not everyone in the nation state of Israel necessarily, that might be confusing, but I honestly believe we're part of the nation, and that we need to be allies to the nation of Israel, God's chosen people.
[time=2259] What about today? That's the history. Right now we live in a country where we have a government that does good things, bad things, we have all kinds of different opinions about that. What about today? What's my role as a citizen today? That's where I want to be headed.
[time=2275] I ask first, what did Jesus say? What Jesus say about my role as a citizen in a country, in a nation state? He said, render under Caesar, the things that are Caesar's, and under God, the things that are God's.
[time=2291] Now he lived in a time where there was a dictatorship oppressing he and his people, and God through Jesus could have absolutely overthrown the Roman Empire without any problem whatsoever.
[time=2305] We'll see that happen in the future. It won't be the Roman Empire, it'll be the whole world's philosophical empire. God could have done that then, but Jesus didn't speak to that.
[time=2315] He said, render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's. Some things are Caesar's. That coin that he had them hold up had Caesar on him, so you give it to him when he asks for it.
[time=2325] Well, what do the epistles say then? If Jesus didn't talk a whole lot about government, he did talk about submission to authority, but what do the epistles say about government?
[time=2333] In Colossians 1, Paul writes that Jesus was the creator of all authority. He is the image of the invisible God, Jesus. The first born over all creation, for by him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things were created by him and for him.
[time=2361] Jesus created every one of these authorities that exist. The position, even the throne, created it all.
[time=2373] He is the image of God, and he created all these things. Then in Romans chapter 13, it gives us some clear direction about why God established authority and how we're to respond to it.
[time=2392] I'd like for you to turn there with me if you would please. Romans chapter 13.
[time=2402] We're going to be reading the first seven verses of Romans chapter 13. Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God.
[time=2419] Therefore, he who resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God, and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.
[time=2428] For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same.
[time=2440] For it is a minister of God to you for good.
[time=2445] But if you do what is evil, be afraid. For it does not bear the sword for nothing. For it is a minister of God and a vinger who brings wrath upon the one who practices evil.
[time=2455] Therefore, it is necessary to be in subjection not only because of wrath, but also for conscience sake. For because of this, you also pay taxes. For rulers are servants of God, devoting themselves to this very thing.
[time=2471] Render to all what is do them, tax to whom taxes do, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.
[time=2485] God's word says that governments are put in place to be ministers of good for us. Do you trust that he has created these authorities, and ultimately in his sovereign control can use them for good in our lives?
[time=2504] I think every Christian has to say yes. I believe God's sovereign. I believe he can use them for good in my life. That's why he invented government in the first place. He created it to allow them to provide order for us.
[time=2518] Think about what the United States would be like today. Well, let's forget the United States. Think about Fort Wayne.
[time=2523] Remove the governmental authority from Fort Wayne this morning. I would like to walk downtown. The heartland of America. Conservative, wonderful, Fort Wayne.
[time=2538] I wouldn't feel safe. Take our police force and all the governing authorities away. People would live to possess everything you have, and they'd take it any way they could.
[time=2551] And God provides us with protection from that, to minister to us for good. And it says in verse 4 that he's an avenger for God against evil doers. He will actually punish those people who do break law, who try to promote disorder among our nation.
[time=2572] These are avengers through the governing authorities. Also in verse 4 it says that they are servants of God to prick our conscience. Verse 6.
[time=2589] Ministers for good, avengers for God, servants of God. If that's true, I can place my trust in there being directed by him at least controlled the outcome being controlled by God through them.
[time=2607] They may not do something that's good for me, but I can rest knowing that God is in control even of that. If he wanted to remove it from me, he could.
[time=2617] So I have peace. What about today? Christ created these authorities. They are here to minister to the good for God, to avenge for evil for God, and to bring about service to God, even in pricking our conscience about good things versus evil things.
[time=2645] God has expectations for us then. What are the expectations that he has for us in this passage? Look at that. He says that we are to subject ourselves to them.
[time=2656] The first two verses are clear. Let every person be in subjection to the governing authority. He wants us to subject ourselves to their leadership. No matter what country you're in, he wants us to pay them.
[time=2669] Well, that's bad news. Look at that. 13, 7. Render all to all what is do them. Tax to whom tax? Custom for custom. Fear for fear and honor to whom honor is due.
[time=2681] He wants us to pay them. Tax is in custom. He wants us to pay them with our respect as well. Pay that position. Respect.
[time=2690] And then he also, in 1 Timothy chapter 2, we probably should turn there. 1 Timothy chapter 2, he says that we are to pray for them. Russell covered this not long ago, was a tremendous message on 1 Timothy chapter 2 verses 1 and 2.
[time=2707] First of all, then I urge that in treaties and prayers, petition and things giving be made on behalf of all men for kings and all who are in authority in order that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.
[time=2725] We pray for them. And when we pray for them, we pray interceding. If I want them to get saved, wouldn't you love it if every governing official in the state of Indiana and the nation of the United States got saved.
[time=2736] And suddenly, now they were making their decisions based on the grid that they look through. They'd look through this filter and say, yeah, let's make a law that agrees with that and let's make a law that agrees with that and let's make a law that agrees when you love that.
[time=2747] I want them to be there. I'm thankful that the believers are there who are there. I pray for them. But that's not why it tells me necessarily pray for them. It tells me to pray that I'll be able to lead a peaceful and tranquil life basically that they'll provide order for me and stay out of my life.
[time=2768] It's a philosophical position of a lot of political analysts. I want them to provide protection for me, provide order, provide structure, but allow me to have the freedom to do what the word of God says I should do in my own family, in my own city, in my own state.
[time=2787] Pay them, subject myself to them, and pray for them. Are you on your knees praying that God would bless those people and he'd use those people and that they would experience wisdom from above that they'll make decisions based on what would be good for all of us that we might lead a peaceful and tranquil life in godliness?
[time=2814] I probably more aware of that the most. I teach US government and economics and I study these passages often and I think about the fact that I need to pray for them often and I don't pray enough.
[time=2827] I need to be praying all the time for this. You know, fortunately, we're in the state of Indiana. Nancy Naul called it the Isle of Indiana as you looked at that political map the other day. The state of Indiana.
[time=2840] We're free from a lot of restrictions that are placed upon people all around the country. We are freeer to operate in our families than almost any state in the United States. Make choices for our children.
[time=2854] I'm grateful for that. And when I think through how God wants me to respond to that government praying for them I need to pray that that'll continue. Please God, don't take away more power from us and give it to governors.
[time=2867] Now here's the twist. Here's the real twist. When you're praying for them and you're paying them and you're submitting to them you need to realize that in our country since 1776 this world never experienced before that.
[time=2883] We are them. You need to be praying for yourself that you'll have wisdom in your voting. You need to make sure that you pay for the government yourself for the things that you want in government that you're asking for.
[time=2897] Pay for them as well. And you need to submit to the government that you choose. It's unique here. Around the world there have been kings forever and there still are despots and power that abuse people oppress people.
[time=2916] This has pray for them. If you live there pray for them that you can live a peaceful and tranquil life. It is I in the United States where the government, we the people of the United States in order for a more perfect union.
[time=2932] Make sure domestic tranquility establish justice, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.
[time=2946] We, the people are the government. Different here. So when I point my finger at them I'm going to pray for them. Pray for us as we make decisions.
[time=2961] That we'll act as ministers, avengers and servants to God in our governmental responsibilities.
[time=2971] Well that's today respecting the government, submitting to the government, praying for the government, paying for the government. That's today. That's what I'm supposed to be doing.
[time=2981] And you know what sometimes it might not be all that good. It might not be that much fun. That's my responsibility. No matter what the circumstances, unless I'm out from under that authority, I'm in some other country where I'm allowed to live, my responsibility is to submit to that authority unless they contradict the mandates of God.
[time=3001] If they tell me to do something here, I have clear example in Book of Acts. John and Peter preached the gospel because they were told to no matter what the governing authorities told them to do. If the governing authorities tell me to commit murder, I will not do it. I don't care what they do to me.
[time=3015] But I also have to be willing to accept the consequences of that. Are you willing to accept the consequences? I think about my own children. I didn't used to worry about government all that much.
[time=3025] But well I can put up with anything. But I can't stand for my kids to have to face it. That happens two years of parent. And I hear grandparents say it even more.
[time=3034] Grandparents learn they don't want their children and their grandchildren to have to suffer oppression or not be permitted to do the things that they've been free to do scripturally.
[time=3044] They struggle with that. It's an emotional thing with them. The good news is, I don't care how bad it gets here.
[time=3051] I don't care if Josh and Steph end up suffering being slain for the cause of Christ here. The truth is, forever they can live with him.
[time=3060] In Isaiah chapter 9 verses 6 and 7, you often hear this passage quoted because it's a passage dealing with the Christmas season and we use it often for unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given.
[time=3071] And the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor. Mighty God, eternal Father, Prince of Peace, there will be no end to the increase of his government or of peace on the throne of David and over his kingdom to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forever more.
[time=3096] The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this prophecy by Isaiah talking about the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3105] I have hope for Josh and Steph and their children if they're still here if the rapture doesn't happen.
[time=3110] I have hope for them not because they're going to be in a land where they're free to do what they want to do, but because they'll know the living God that's what I hope.
[time=3117] And they'll be willing to bow down and recognize themselves as a nation, a select group of people chosen by God to move through history as a unit and look forward to living with the Lord Jesus Christ forever more in peace in heaven.
[time=3132] Revelation chapter 19 says he's the king of kings. He does battle for us there. Revelation chapter 20 says he's the king of kings and he reigns and judges justly for us.
[time=3149] Revelation chapter 21 says he's the king of kings and he lives with his people. After 19 and 20 are finished, we get to be with him forever directly under a theocracy again in perfect union with the Lord God Almighty who created it all and governs it all.
[time=3169] And we get to experience no death, no mourning, no crying, no pain. That's what Revelation 21 says. No more death, no more mourning, no more tears, no more pain. Peace with him.
[time=3187] Before the old order is passed away, behold all things are new. He created a brand new heaven and a brand new earth just for us to live with him on. It's going to be a glorious day.
[time=3198] So I can suffer under lots of persecution from governments if I had to. Now you know what, right now we haven't had to suffer much.
[time=3206] But other people in the world have and we keep praying, thanking God for the blessing of being an American and I'm thankful I'm an American believe me. But I also know it's possible that Mexico or Canada or anybody could develop the laser, laser, phaser beam and put us under oppression.
[time=3221] Somebody could develop a weapon that we're not prepared to defend against. It's a possibility that we'd have to yield ourselves, our government to another government. Somebody that has tremendous power. That's always possible. I don't be prepared for that.
[time=3235] I don't think it'll really be the laser, laser phaser beam, by the way. I want to be ready for that. I want to be ready for that and look forward to being with the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.
[time=3251] Here's the application. Number one, I want to know in my heart that God has been is now and forevermore will be sovereign and in control of anything that happens to me and his children.
[time=3269] Number one, number two, I want to be obedient and submissive to the governing authorities.
[time=3277] You know what's interesting about that is both of those give us peace. I get tremendous peace when I think about the fact that God sovereign and I get tremendous peace when I'm really obedient and submissive to a government, even when I disagree with them as long as they're not mandating sin when I yield to them.
[time=3293] It even happens in the government of this church. I get tremendous peace when I'm able to act we ask and give to the leadership of our elders when they disagree with me and the majority of them say we should go this direction or the congregation says we should.
[time=3305] I can have peace by just saying now I'm on your side because the majority has voted. I get peace or I get anguish and anxiety if I don't do that.
[time=3316] Number three, I get peace when I pray for authorities. When I'm praying for our governor or our mayor or our councilman and women or our national officials, I get tremendous peace.
[time=3330] You know why? Because it helps me remember they're not in charge. They're not in charge. When I'm praying for them and I pray that God will keep them separate from us and allow us to be free.
[time=3342] I'm thankful for that. Fourthly, I look forward to serving the king of kings in person. That gives me more than just peace at the moment. That gives me an exhilaration that I don't feel any other way.
[time=3355] When I think about and study the book of Revelation and see what's going to be happening to me in the future that I'm going to be able to be with him forever and ever more and it's going to be peace-filled existence, no crying, no tears, no mourning.
[time=3367] When I really believe that, I get filled with peace. This morning, do you know Christ as your Savior? Do you believe He's sovereign in all of this?
[time=3378] Are you able to submit yourselves to governing authorities that you don't agree with and have peace in your heart?
[time=3384] Are you praying for governing authorities because they need our prayers?
[time=3389] Are you looking forward to an anticipation being with him, the king of kings, Lord of lords, as my ruler forevermore, I am.
[time=3399] I'm looking forward to that. If you know Christ as your Savior, you can too. Let's pray.
[time=3407] I hope you enjoyed the music from our sanctuary choir, the brass ensemble, and soloist Margie Isaacson.
[time=3420] Our message today was from our associate pastor, Steve Longbrake. If you've made a decision today to trust Christ as your personal Savior, just before we close, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3434] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this opportunity to come and pray to you today, and today I sense a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3444] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus name I pray, amen.
