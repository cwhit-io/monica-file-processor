[time=0] This is a church that had gone through the Refiners fire, the Crucible of Tribulation, and as a result they are without Rebuke.
[time=9] The persecution had made them strong and pure.
[time=13] And what might have been in their fellowship and in their personal lives that would have brought condemnation by our Lord by this time has been purged from them.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=44] Thank you for joining us.
[time=47] The day may be coming when Christians may be persecuted.
[time=51] A day when to name Jesus Christ as Lord may bring a loss of one's job or imprisonment or even death.
[time=59] Today in our study of Revelation we will look at the example of Christians who have gone through this very ordeal yet remained faithful and received the crown of life.
[time=70] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation.
[time=74] We will be looking at chapter 2 verses 8-14.
[time=78] Our special music today will feature our sanctuary choir, a solo by Denise Mitchell, and a special number by Reflection.
[time=89] Let's now join our service.
[time=108] Praise him, praise him, Jesus, our blessed Redeemer.
[time=123] Sing over his wonderful offering.
[time=138] Sing along with his holy hand.
[time=145] By God's Shedwood, Jesus will guide his children.
[time=153] In his heart, he carries them all along.
[time=162] Praise him, praise him, how is this life?
[time=176] Praise him, praise him, Jesus, our blessed Redeemer.
[time=226] Praise him, praise him, how is this life?
[time=369] Praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, how is this life?
[time=390] Praise him, praise him, praise him, how is this life?
[time=411] Praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, how is this life?
[time=433] Praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him, praise him.
[time=498] Well, hello again, and thank you for watching the Bible Hour.
[time=508] We're delighted that we hear from you from week to week, and it's a great encouragement to us.
[time=513] Russell, this is the Thanksgiving Week, and we are certainly thankful for our families and our church family here.
[time=519] Both of us have families in California, and so I know that makes a little bit of adjustment on Thanksgiving Day.
[time=525] It does, because Thanksgiving and Christmas are so tied to family, but we're thankful that we have our own family here, and we can focus on that a little more and build our own traditions.
[time=535] And so we're excited about that, and then of course we'll stay in touch with the family in California, give them a phone call and reassure them of our love and just communicate with them.
[time=544] I'm kind of in a divided situation now with my family, one boy in Chicago and one in Southern Indiana, and so I have the family that comes back home here, my immediate children, and then I have the same situation in California with my aunts and uncles and brothers and sisters and mom and dad out there, but we do the same thing.
[time=562] We look forward to that telephone call just to reinforce the fact that we love each other, we're thankful for our families, and despite of the distance there is a closeness that just really remains, and that's great.
[time=572] And we're thankful for our church family. We get together on Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving, and fellowship together, and that's great.
[time=580] Russell, you've been in the ministry of teaching the word from the Book of Revelation, and that seems to be going well. We're talking about the churches that are mentioned there.
[time=589] We're talking about the seven churches, and that's a tremendously impactful series of letters, because you can't just look at what's being said there and refer it to those people.
[time=602] You inevitably bring it back to your own life and to your own church and evaluate how you're doing, and so it's been tremendous opportunity to have that kind of self-evaluation.
[time=613] And to think through the church at Ephesus, having left its first love, and the purity and the strength of the church at Smirna, because of the persecution.
[time=621] I mean, who wants to go through that kind of persecution, but yet you look at the quality of their faith, and it's almost enticing, knowing that though you'd have to go through it, it'd be worth it.
[time=632] It would be nice to take all of the good attributes of all of the churches and hope that our church, our body of believers, would attain to that kind of purity, but unfortunately, even though we have many people that love the Lord here, there's just those qualities that sneak in that aren't as positive as we'd like to do.
[time=654] Right, and some of that just dictated by the influence of an ungodly culture on us, though we could even identify and say we don't want it to be that way, it does, it impacts us, and we're not as strong as we could be.
[time=666] And then, of course, as we move through these first couple of chapters, and we'll get to the end of the age, and some of the exciting, explosive topics that really, as we look around us today, I was reading Newsweek this morning, and they were talking about the end of the world.
[time=682] As the space and asteroids and things flying by the earth and missing us just barely anticipate, they're talking about the end of the age scientifically, and so it seems to all be very curious and fascinating as you read the Word of God.
[time=698] Well, I'd like to remind our viewers again that you need to stay tuned each week because this is a very important series in the Book of Revelation and very pertinent to the Christian and the end times.
[time=711] We're going to be sending you a letter in just a few days. It should arrive in your home explaining to you the need financially that we have in the Bible hour. We're so thankful for the Founders Club and the number of people that write and faithfully give each month to support this ministry.
[time=728] We don't ask for money very often, but we have a need to finish in the black this year and also to purchase some new equipment from time to time. Our equipment just simply wears out. A number of pieces of equipment are over 10 years old, and we need to just be sure that we're up to date with our equipment so we can function from week to week.
[time=747] So we're anticipating purchasing some new equipment as God places it upon your heart to give to the Bible hour during this year and time, and I hope you'll respond as you receive that letter from us.
[time=759] And then just before we go back to the live portion of our service, I want to remind you of the booklet that we're offering Christ in Christmas, a family Advent celebration.
[time=769] If you'll just write to us today, we'll send you that book. You can receive it by writing to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=783] Once again, that's the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. That book actually is designed for the four weeks prior to Christmas, but you can put it together if you write to us right away, and you can still use it for your family time.
[time=803] There's scripture, there's some poems, and some readings, and even some choruses, just a real important series of little messages telling us the real purpose for the Christmas season and why Christ came.
[time=818] We'll go back to the live portion of our service now. I hope you'll stay with us.
[time=833] [MUSIC - 238 seconds]
[time=1081] Thank you, reflection. Beautifully done. Let's take our Bibles this morning and return to our ongoing study in the book of Revelation. We come this morning to the second chapter, and we will consider verses 8, 9, 10, and 11.
[time=1102] It is the church at Smirna, or the letter, or the message to the church at Smirna. Follow along as I read these four verses to you. Revelation chapter 2 verse 8.
[time=1116] "And to the angel of the church at Smirna, right, the first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life," says this.
[time=1126] "I know your tribulation and your poverty, but you are rich, and the blasphemy by those who save our Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan," verse 10.
[time=1139] "Do not fear what you are about to suffer; behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life."
[time=1154] "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches." "He who overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death." This is a somewhat unique or distinctive letter of the seven. First of all, it is the shortest of all the seven letters, just these four verses.
[time=1173] Secondly, Smirna was clearly the most beautiful of all the seven cities addressed in this book. Thirdly, of all the seven cities, it is only Smirna that exists even to this day.
[time=1187] Izmir, in modern Turkey, is its name now. It's a thriving city of about 300,000 people. All the other cities have long since disappeared.
[time=1197] Fourthly, it is the only city out of two, or the only churches of the seven, this one in Philadelphia, that have no condemnation included in the letter.
[time=1209] As Christ looks at these churches, and He reviews them, in five of them He finds reason to rebuke them. This is one of the churches where there is no rebuke given.
[time=1220] And it seems rather obvious as to why. If you read it, you notice the word tribulation and poverty, and suffering, and being tested, and being faithful, even while put in prison and all the way until death.
[time=1237] This is a church that is under enormous persecution, and that testing and tribulation is having its perfect work, and that shouldn't surprise us.
[time=1246] Even as James says, in James 1, "Consider it all joy, my brother, and when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance, and let endurance have its perfect work, that you may be perfect, complete, lacking in nothing."
[time=1263] There is a dynamic that is a part of the spiritual world that when true believers are put under the test and under tribulation, it doesn't defeat their faith, it purifies it, it refines it, and they come out the other side of it stronger than they ever were before.
[time=1279] And for reasons through this tribulation, whatever might have been in this church that Christ would have said negatively about it, or rebuke for it, have been weaned out of it, have been taken out of it by this great tribulation and persecution.
[time=1294] The actual threats that they were facing in this particular church were one social ostracision, and then poverty, real abject poverty, and then imprisonment and eventually death.
[time=1308] That kind of pressure has a way of weeding out all the spiritual lightweights in any given church.
[time=1315] Hypocrites don't stay long when that kind of stuff starts to attack the church. The Christian socialites find a different place to socialize, the phonies disappear.
[time=1326] With them goes all the false teachers and the false prophets, because they don't believe enough in what they're teaching to undergo this kind of persecution, so they exit as well, and they take with them their false doctrine, which would hamper any true believing church.
[time=1343] It is only the genuine believer that is left. It is only the true believer that will fight its way through and subject itself to this kind of torture and pain and even death for their love of Christ.
[time=1360] After last week's message on the church at Ephesus, the church that had left its first love, a friend of mine in this church, said to me, "You know, I appreciate what you said, and it meant a lot to me, I'm thankful for it."
[time=1373] But there was something in there you said that I'm not sure I agree with. I said, "Really? Join the crowd, no, I didn't say that." I said, "Really, what?"
[time=1382] And he said, "Well, you were talking about how you believe that like 90% of us, or most of us, or the vast majority of us, if put to a test because of our conviction for the truth, would get up and walk out the door and be burned at the stake rather than renounce Christ."
[time=1401] And he said, "I'd like to think that's true of our church, but I don't know if it really is."
[time=1408] And we stood there a minute longer and then he said something that I respect him for, really just being honest with himself. He said, "You know, I'm not even sure I would."
[time=1419] What would you do? What would you do?
[time=1424] If your faith was put to the test, this kind of extreme test, where you either renounce Christ or die.
[time=1437] To put this in perspective, keep your finger here in Revelation, will you, and come with me to Matthew.
[time=1443] Matthew chapter 10, "Jesus has summoned his twelve disciples."
[time=1453] And he is now going to send them out to do the work of evangelism.
[time=1457] Matthew chapter 10, verse 1, "And having summoned his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness."
[time=1468] And the rest of this chapter, he goes on to talk to them about what he wants them to do and how he wants them to respond and what their ministry is going to be like.
[time=1476] In verse 7, he tells them what they're supposed to preach.
[time=1479] And as you go, preach saying, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, give credential to your preaching by verse 8, heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out the demons, freely you have received, freely give.
[time=1492] This is a powerful, wonderful healing ministry of the forgiving grace of God that they would proclaim and then prove to those who listened that they were of God by the various miracles that they would perform.
[time=1502] And you would expect that they would have been greeted and warmly welcomed and thanked and appreciated and honored for this great ministry.
[time=1509] But no, look at verse 22, he says, "But you will be hated by all on account of my name, but it is the one who has endured to the end who will be saved."
[time=1525] That's the same truth, he's saying to the church at Smirna, if your faith is real and genuine and is true, you'll walk it all the way through to the end of death and you'll still be found faithful. You won't recant.
[time=1537] Verse 23, "But when they persecute you in this city, flee to the next." For truly, I say to you, "You shall not finish going through the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes."
[time=1548] He says, "When they reject you and they start to persecute you, go to the next city and the next city and the next city." But he knows that eventually they'll run out of cities.
[time=1556] The persecution will catch up with them. Verse 28, "It'll be a box canyon, if you will. There'll be nowhere to run. Do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul."
[time=1568] But rather, fear him who is able to destroy both the soul and body in hell, namely God. Don't fear these men who can take your life, fear me, fear God because he can take your life and your soul.
[time=1580] And then where we're really headed here in verse 32 and 33, look at what he says, "Everyone, therefore, who shall confess me before men, I will also confess before my father who is in heaven.
[time=1595] But whoever shall deny me before men, I will also deny him before my father who is in heaven."
[time=1604] Christ will not claim you in heaven if you will not claim him on earth. If Christ does not claim you in heaven, you don't go there.
[time=1615] If Christ says he does not know you, Matthew 7, you are set out to the place of eternal torture.
[time=1625] It's very clear now, this is not a work salvation. This doesn't mean you've got to work your way to heaven by confessing him even under persecution.
[time=1632] No, not at all. The absolute opposite is true. What it's confirming is genuine true faith in Christ.
[time=1638] And people who have really come to faith in Christ will confess him in that moment and he will confess them in heaven.
[time=1650] You know, we in America have trouble with this because we think, at least I do, that persecution is something that happened at the beginning of the church.
[time=1660] Persecution is something that happened to Christ and they were still angry at Christ and so it kind of ran on into the New Testament church and it was an explosive beginning and it was a new thing and people hadn't come accustomed to it yet and they were somewhat abrasive because they were new and all that persecution was really just back then.
[time=1679] We know so little of it persecution I mean by virtue of the fact that we live in America. But I want you to know that persecution is normative even as it says in Matthew 10.
[time=1690] They're going to hate you for my name's sake. Expect it and this is how to respond to it.
[time=1696] If you'll think about your lifetime and let's think of the last just 70 years in world history. Do you realize that most of the people on this planet who have named the name of Christ have suffered this kind of persecution?
[time=1708] We are the odd balls. We are the exception to the rule. We are a typical persecution in the last 70 years in this world is typical for believers.
[time=1719] Think of the billion people that live in China. They estimate a church of some 50 million there that is hot and thriving and pure and strong and aggressive because it is under this kind of persecution.
[time=1733] I remember being in China and going with Dr. Bob Provost to visit Chinese woman there. She was a lawyer and a professor of law at this university that I won't name.
[time=1746] And in order for us to get to her house one night we had to take a series of different buses and taxis and walks and then through different buildings and the whole thing was to try to make sure we weren't being followed.
[time=1758] We were being led by a guide another woman who was stationed in Hong Kong and moves in and out of China for the purpose of encouraging the church underground in China and she led us to this woman.
[time=1770] It was probably an hour and a half or deal to get what would normally have taken us 10 minutes just to drive over there. Why?
[time=1777] Because if she were discovered at that level as having a faith in Jesus Christ and if we who were missionaries would reveal that in a way that didn't need to be revealed she would have gone under incredible persecution.
[time=1792] She would have lost her job she would have been unable to pay for her home with her family and who knows what would have occurred. If you want to talk about Russia and what used to be Eastern Europe and the millions and millions and millions of people that have been under that incredible opposition.
[time=1809] To God they have been forced fed atheism and now the doors start to open and out of the doors come the stories of what has been happening to the pastors there and the Christians there they have been living under the constant pressure of persecution.
[time=1825] Christ experienced it the order church experienced it they experienced it Paul said in 2nd Timothy 3 12 and indeed all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[time=1838] It's normative Christian experience we are the ones because we have been blessed to live in America that don't understand that and the thought of persecution really in this country to get persecuted so far you almost got to be weird.
[time=1851] You got to be awe you almost have to aggravate it because our country has extended such remarkable religious freedom I'm not sure that's going to continue.
[time=1860] I'm not sure at all that in my lifetime where the lifetime of my children that that kind of religious freedom is going to exist in our country.
[time=1869] Just this week I was meeting with some of our elders and deacons and some men in our church and we were discussing some things about our church one of which was church discipline and the truth laid out in the word of God in Matthew 18 as to how to pursue fallen brothers in your church and bring them back to repentance.
[time=1886] One of the men in the meeting is an attorney he's a member of our church and also attorney in our city and he had done a remarkable job in researching the trend in America and speaking with other attorneys who had devoted their lives to this kind of investigation and religious rights.
[time=1903] He warned us he said if you go about this and by the way he said and I believe we need to go about this exactly as the Bible teaches it unequivocally but he said I want you to know as an attorney not as legal counsel we weren't hiring him he's just one of us.
[time=1919] I want you to know that if you proceed in this direction it is likely very likely that you will be persecuted for it in the form of lawsuits and as a group of men in a preliminary way trying to discuss and weigh the options and realize that we were now moving into an era in this country drastically different than previous days.
[time=1944] We're just to obey the simple commands of scripture now may bring legal action against this church and all the weird stuff that would be maligned of us by the press etc etc etc.
[time=1959] I'm not sure where we're headed and so with that just as I'm sure in your own heart you see trends in your world that lead you possibly to that same kind of concern about our future.
[time=1971] We look at the church at Smyrna and we will learn from them this morning how the church of Christ responds to persecution what God expects of us.
[time=1982] Revelation chapter 2 as is our custom when studying each one of these churches will look at it along seven points because there is no condemnation of Smyrna will have only six because there at that point doesn't exist.
[time=1997] These six points this morning are as follows the correspondent the city the church the commendation the command and then the council.
[time=2007] Let's go through these one by one first the correspondent who's writing this letter look at verse 8.
[time=2013] And in the angel of the church in Smyrna right the first and the last who was dead and has come to life says this your author your correspondent is Christ and as I've shared with you it is characteristic of him to draw for his title from the vision he gave of himself in chapter 1.
[time=2034] And he selects there out of verses 17 and 18 in chapter 1 of that vision do not be afraid I am the first and the last I am the eternal one I there never was a time when I wasn't and there never be a time when I'm not.
[time=2048] Verse 18 and the living one and I was dead and behold I am alive forever more and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
[time=2058] To a church that is on the edge of being thrown in prison and losing its life for the gospel being put to death for its faith in Christ he says to them remember I am the one who was dead and have come to life.
[time=2073] In essence I have experienced everything you're going to experience I know what it's like to be persecuted I know what it's like to be put to death and I also know what it's like to be brought back to life by the power of God.
[time=2085] And the same power of God that brought me back to life will bring you back to life as your faith in Jesus Christ allows that is the joy that is the hope of the believer resurrection.
[time=2099] So he identifies with them and in that gives them great encouragement and builds credibility to be listened to as he gives them counsel in what follows.
[time=2110] Secondly the city the city I mentioned to you that it's noted as the most beautiful city in all of Asia Minor it wasn't that day it's about 35 miles north of Ephesus if Ephesus is here in the G and C wraps this way or actually up and around then Smirna is about 35 miles north of Ephesus and in in fact all these seven churches are really the route of the ancient postal district of that day.
[time=2136] And if you know just regular general mail was going to be sent around it would go in this exact clockwise fashion as these churches are listed in the book for us.
[time=2145] And you'll notice it says in verse 8 and to the angel of the church at Smirna and I've suggested to you that that word could have been translated messenger or church leader which I believe it is.
[time=2156] Exactly seven leaders one from each one of these churches went across the G and C to the island Patmos where John was exiled to receive the only copy of this book the book of Revelation.
[time=2168] They would have then returned back and started in Ephesus all seven of them would have returned there they would have made a copy of that book handwritten copy of it.
[time=2178] They would then have the one guy from Ephesus stayed right there and six others moved along the route and each time they drop a guy at each city because that was his home that's where he would stay and the remaining guys would carry that letter on to the next cities.
[time=2191] But this is a as it was described to me as I read and studied about it a beautiful city.
[time=2198] This was a city that had the privilege of being right on the edge of a gorgeous harbor that was unusually deep.
[time=2206] And the rolling hills came off the ocean and tell it was cradled by a mountain some 500 feet high and up the face of this mountain kind of looped or laced a road they called the street of gold.
[time=2218] And along that road there would have been businesses and shops and excuse me until they finally came to the top of the building or excuse me the top of the mountain.
[time=2226] And there were all the stately public buildings sitting across the top of this mountain and it actually looked like the crown of smurna in fact that's what they called it the city was cradled by this mountain and on the top of the mountain were these beautiful buildings which capture the eye of all who would come and visit.
[time=2243] At the one side of the mountain was the temple civil which was also very beautiful on the other the temple Zeus Apollo was another temple there and Aphrodite so this city was given over to paganism it was a beautiful city and it was a prosperous city.
[time=2260] And somehow existing in that city was the true church people of faith in Christ.
[time=2266] Now all we know about the church at smurna is in these four verses this is it there's no record of them in the book of Acts there's no mention of them anywhere else in the New Testament everything we know about this church is right here in these four verses.
[time=2278] We assume that it came into existence by the ministry of the Apostle Paul when he was in Ephesus for some three years.
[time=2284] Acts 19 says that his preaching from Ephesus was heard all over Asia this is obviously in that vicinity so some people may have been on business from smurna in Ephesus came to Christ and brought the gospel back or they may have sent missionaries out to smurna we don't know but it's likely that it came into existence through the preaching and teaching ministry of the Apostle Paul.
[time=2304] We learn more about the church under the heading their commendation what does Christ say about that what are they noted for how does he congratulate them or strengthen them and that's found in verse 9.
[time=2315] This is really interesting look at this verse 9 I know your tribulation and your poverty but you are rich and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not but are a synagogue of Satan.
[time=2331] The word tribulation it means pressure I know the pressure that you're under it's used other places in the New Testament to describe the calamities of war or the distress of starvation or the pain of a woman in childbirth in other words this is an absolutely preoccupying tribulation this isn't something that nagged you as you try to get on with your life this is your life this tribulation is all consuming.
[time=2359] You say why why do they have this tribulation why not the other churches why didn't Ephesus have this tribulation well the answer to that is this smurna had a long tradition with room.
[time=2372] Through the many civil wars that went on inside the Roman Empire smurna somehow managed to always stay on the winning side and so they had a growing allegiance to Rome.
[time=2381] And in 195 BC they built there the great temple deos Romanos which means Rome is divine and it was the beginning in Asia Minor of worshipping Rome as a government.
[time=2395] Some years later they began to fall in line with a commitment to Emperor worship as Caesar soon took on deity status and made to be worshiped.
[time=2406] And by the time this letter is written and shortly thereafter this is all coming to culmination and development of this kind of evolutionary cycle in smurna as people move towards Emperor worship.
[time=2416] It came to a head and this is it if you were a believer in fact everybody in smurna had to go to the magistrate once a year and in the presence of that magistrate they had to say these words Caesar is Lord.
[time=2433] Once a year you go down to the city hall stand before whoever it was presiding in that particular session you'd have to stand up and say these words Caesar is Lord.
[time=2448] Without that certificate you were marked and apparently the type of opposition and tribulation that came to them was primarily financial look again at verse 9.
[time=2458] I know your tribulation and your poverty there are two Greek words in the new testament for poverty.
[time=2463] One of them canna means that you're that you're not rich you have nothing superfluous you have no extras you have enough for your basic needs it's kind of hand of mouth kind of poverty.
[time=2474] But the other word in the new testament to us is I have nothing at all I struggle just to survive I struggle just to have enough sustenance to live yet another day.
[time=2486] That's the word he uses here so the picture that emerges in our understanding of this kind of tribulation is this as emperor worship increased in that city they had to go and say Caesar is Lord.
[time=2499] The Christian wouldn't do that he didn't have the certificate which meant that he was a marked person or she was a marked person in that city.
[time=2506] And therefore they were shunned by the people of that city until they finally fell into abject poverty think about it you who own businesses and are dependent upon your businesses to finance your debt and the whole thing we call capitalism and and building and moving ahead you don't have a certificate.
[time=2523] Quietly but noticeably your business starts to fall off and you're unable to meet your debt service you're unable to handle the requirements that are there and you default and they take not just your business but the assets you use to secure that business.
[time=2542] And for those of you who don't own businesses those of you who who work for other people you're capable you're intelligent you're contributing but you don't have a certificate and with time you are found out and they find ways to get you out of employment and you find that you can get only the lowest paying jobs if any inside the city.
[time=2563] So over a period of time and by the way this is a progressive tribulation this in my mind would be so much harder than having somebody come up to me and say denounce Christ or I blow your head off.
[time=2573] You know that's one time shot I'm in heaven try living and watching your life and everything you've worked for and everything you care about start kind of just dwindling and falling away year after year after year until you come to abject poverty and the feelings of guilt you would have in your inability to provide for your family.
[time=2591] And wondering did I do the right thing should I have should I have just said Caesar is Lord unbelievable pressure unbelievable tribulation and it was agitated by the Jews look at verse 9 and the blasphemy by those who say they are Jews and are not but in fact are a synagogue of Satan.
[time=2611] The word blasphemy it's translated that way in my Bible maybe it's slander in your Bible it could be either typically what is going on here is they are slandering the Christians and only in the persecution we know from church history the kind of slander that the Jew would bring against the believer they would accuse them of being cannibals because we eat the flesh and drink the blood in communion.
[time=2634] They would accuse and slander them as being a very lustful and wanton people because we greet each other with a holy kiss and celebrate the love thesis.
[time=2644] They would accuse the Christians of being home records are home destroyers because when one of these family members would come to Christ out of this pagan culture begin to live for Christ it would destroy their celebrations it would destroy their holidays and it may destroy their family and so they would accuse and persecute them because they were home records.
[time=2663] But ultimately this thing culminates in their being called atheists because you are an atheist unless you said Caesar is Lord and then also rebellion and political disloyalty.
[time=2679] So they eventually these Jews became informants to the Roman government and to those who were most zealous in the worship of the emperor and they would as informants signify and point out who the Christians were in their area or in their place of work or in their location of living that didn't worship Caesar and those people would be delivered up to prison and eventually dead.
[time=2702] So their situation is difficult notice what it's called it's called a synagogue of Satan that's interesting isn't it apparently these Jews were able to bow down and say Caesar is Lord and still hang on to some of their Judaism they still met in synagogues and it's reminiscent of John 1915 when Jesus Christ is being tried and just before his crucifixion and pilot says to the Jews that it gathered.
[time=2727] He said this is your king the king of Israel and they said we have no king but who Caesar they were well trained in the art of maneuvering into the political arena in the city in which they live they knew what to say they knew how to exist and they were all the while denying the true God.
[time=2748] And so what Jesus says is this you're not a synagogue of Judaism you're a synagogue of Satan and here's the point when the Jews rejected Christ Judaism became Satanism when the Jews rejected their Lord and crucified him Judaism became Satanism which is true of any other religion in the world that doesn't honor and exalt Christ it's all just a synagogue of Satan or a temple of Satan so he unmasks them calls them what they are.
[time=2777] So you have tribulation you have poverty it's being aggravated by those who hate you in the Jews that search and seek you out to inform against you but in verse 90 says you're rich.
[time=2790] This is you're really rich you have nothing but really you have everything what does he mean well you're holy people you're a mature people you're a godly people.
[time=2804] You have your integrity you didn't compromise what you said you believed your love for Christ is not in question your life has focus and power your full of love and joy you have friends and you know who your friends are those who stand with you in the persecution you have divine resource in God and you have a sympathetic savior who by his own death and resurrection guarantees your own resurrection after your death you have everything you're rich.
[time=2832] And so he encourages them in that way. Now let's go to verse 10 and look at the command if that's the commendation what is the command what's he tell him to do look at it do not fear what you are about the suffer what behold the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tested and you will have tribulation ten days be faithful until death and I will give you the crown of life.
[time=2859] He says don't fear and be faithful that is his command don't fear them and be faithful you know at this point after all they've suffered they've lost all their possessions they've been socially ostracized you'd like him to come in and say and by the way it's over now you've done well we're going to make the situation easier for you but no instead it's going to get harder it's going to become intensified it's going to go from poverty and social ostracism to imprisonment and death.
[time=2888] But don't fear it be faithful to me I don't know do you think about that when it was in studying the passage in the conversation I had stimulates my mind and I think of of the great testing in the old testament that of Shadrach me shack and a bend to go these three young youths these three young boys I don't have three young boys I have four young daughters and I think of them out there at times on the ground.
[time=2917] I think of them out there with all those people representative of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom that have been drawn there from all the nations of the world and this great image that he had built and he's trying to unify his people and he's demanding that they worship him and the great Babylon and he had said to all those youths and all those people if you do not bow down when you hear the orchestra do their big sound thing you're going to be thrown in that fiery furnace.
[time=2943] And I picture my daughters there and if I could be there and not be there I mean like I can whisper in their ear and not be seen.
[time=2954] And that orchestra is getting ready to do their big noise what are you going to whisper in their ear what are you going to say.
[time=2966] I'd like to think I'd kind of reach over and say don't you dare bow down.
[time=2976] Don't you dare bow down to that guy.
[time=2982] And then if they didn't and they were grabbed by the soldiers as Shadrach me shack and a bend to go were and taken in front of the very furnace and were given a second opportunity to decry their God and to denounce him.
[time=2995] And they were in the very presence of the fire. You know what Shadrach and me shack and a bend to go said they said our God is able to deliver us from the fire and if not they didn't think they didn't they didn't bind God to deliver them from that they were fully where they may burn up that day.
[time=3013] And if not we will not bow down and worship you okay never could never.
[time=3020] What would it feel like to watch your kids walk into that fiery furnace and have their life consumed.
[time=3027] I think we'd be filled with tears of joy.
[time=3031] Tears of joy because they had stood strong they had died with integrity they had named Christ and lived Christ it may be your proudest moment in life.
[time=3042] Well at the same time your eyes would know no doubt be filled with tears of sadness as you saw the torture that they went through and the trauma and the loss of relationship.
[time=3052] I believe that when you and I stand strong it says if our Heavenly Father is up there whispering in our ear don't you dare.
[time=3059] Don't you dare bend down and when he sees us walk faithfully to the place of death it may be his greatest moment.
[time=3067] His greatest joy as he can see our faith being proved and real and genuine knowing that life is but a vapor that he'll resurrect us and that we'll spend forever with him.
[time=3080] And the glory of knowing that we did not bow down let me say it again persecution and trials and hardship will always destroy false faith.
[time=3091] But that same stuff persecution and hardship and trials will always strengthen and confirm and reveal genuine faith.
[time=3102] It's never any other way.
[time=3105] So the correspondent the city the church the commendation the command do not fear be faithful and lastly the council.
[time=3115] Look at it here in verse 11 he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches and he who overcome shall not be hurt by the second death the second death is called hell.
[time=3132] He who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says in other words he's pleading believe me you can trust me.
[time=3141] What I'm saying to you is right when they want you to bow down don't do it don't fear him and be faithful die for the name of Christ.
[time=3150] Listen to what I'm saying he pleads with them.
[time=3153] There was a man who did many who did in church history one by the name of polycarp.
[time=3159] I want to just read you an excerpt from a letter that was sent from the church of Smirna to the other six churches.
[time=3166] After polycarp's martyrdom this are excerpts taken from that letter.
[time=3175] It was the time of the public games the city was crowded and the crowds were excited.
[time=3182] Suddenly the shot went up away with the atheists let polycarp be searched for he was a great leader of that church.
[time=3192] His whereabouts were betrayed to the persecutors by a little slave girl who collapsed under torture as they came to arrest him.
[time=3202] Not even the soldiers captain wished to see polycarp die on the brief journey to the city he pled to the old man quote what harm is it to say Caesar is Lord and to sacrifice and save your life.
[time=3217] But polycarp was adamant that for him only Jesus Christ was Lord.
[time=3224] He entered the arena there the pro council gave him the choice of cursing the name of Christ and making sacrifice to Caesar or death.
[time=3234] 80 and six years I have served him said polycarp and he has done me no wrong how can I blaspheme my king who saved me.
[time=3244] The pro council threatened him with burning polycarp replied you threaten me with the fire that burns for a time and is quickly quenched for you do not know the fire which awaits the wicked and the judgment that comes and in the everlasting punishment.
[time=3259] Why are you waiting come do what you will.
[time=3264] He taunts them he remained unmovable so crowds came flocking with their sticks from the work at place from the baths and the Jews even although they were breaking the Sabbath law by carrying such burdens were foremost in the clamor and bringing wood for the fire.
[time=3287] They were going to bind him to the stake he responded leave me as I am he said for he who gives me power to endure the fire will grant me to remain in the flames unmoved even without the security you will give by binding.
[time=3306] So they left him loosely in the flames and there he died for Christ. Amen so it is for him so it was for him and so it may be for us.
[time=3322] Make resolve in your heart today to claim Christ as Lord and none other no matter what it may cost you or your family.
[time=3335] Let's pray together.
[time=3339] Father thank you for the testimony of these noble Christians in Smirna.
[time=3345] Thank you for the commitment that they had to Christ willing to suffer tribulation imprisonment and for some even death.
[time=3357] And Father make us bold for Christ. Grant us the strength and the courage and the growth and the perspective and the wisdom to be completely and totally committed to the person of Christ to have him as our Lord totally and completely under his sovereign power.
[time=3378] That should the day come whether it be tomorrow with a neighbor or a business associate that inappropriate ways and ways that are sensitive to the situation a real willingness in our hearts to name Christ as Lord.
[time=3394] Or should it come in some time in this country's future for us to be tested even at the stake.
[time=3403] And that we would name Christ above all others and none other. And whose name we pray. Amen.
