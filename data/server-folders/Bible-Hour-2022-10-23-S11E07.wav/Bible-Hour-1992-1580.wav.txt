[time=0] And though Satan had been unsuccessful with this little church, who had the unfortunate
[time=6] lot of being in the very city where Satan had made his throne, verse 13, they had successfully
[time=13] said no to the bold, brash, open, obvious invitation to negligent sin.
[time=20] But Satan had gone around the back door of their church and was involving members of their
[time=26] church, probably peripheral members, weaker members of their church, in overt sin of the
[time=32] sensuous sort, which he hoped would act like leaven and eventually penetrate the entire church whereby it would crumble at the feet of Satan.
[time=55] Thank you for joining us.
[time=63] Have you ever noticed that if Satan can't tear your faith down through an obvious sin, he will sneak around to the back door of your life to destroy your faith through subtle compromise?
[time=72] Today in Pastor Moore's continuing study of Revelation, we will learn how to prevent Satan from gaining the advantage in our lives through such back door efforts.
[time=83] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Revelation.
[time=86] We will be looking at chapter 2 verses 12 through 17.
[time=93] Our special music today will feature the sanctuary choir with soloists Michelle Smekens and Kevin Rowe and a solo by Bev Brunkey.
[time=105] Let's now join our service.
[time=132] She was born in radiant beauty on a takeoff and a cost and give a power from one light to
[time=144] sing them with the lots, though at times it seems her enemies would forthorough to retreat.
[time=156] Till she stands undolten, for no one can de-seem his glorious church.
[time=169] His precious bride, for you he came, for you he died, and he come from the grave.
[time=185] He is the one who will hold you, for the one who is born in service.
[time=201] So her beauty may be glamished by the face of you, the one who thought her with his love,
[time=221] will heal the blemished heart.
[time=239] Till she stands undolten, for no one can de-seem his glorious church.
[time=299] His precious bride, for you he died, and he come from the grave.
[time=319] Till she stands undolten, for no one can de-seem his glorious church.
[time=363] Good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=383] The man behind all of this is Peter Coby.
[time=395] It was a dream in 1976, and I had a few sketches of a tree that I saw in California.
[time=407] We came here and had the plans drawn up, and we started in 1977 with the tree, started out with just basically a tree.
[time=417] And then when we moved to our new worship center, it grew in height and diameter, and holds about 165 people now, and then we've added some sets to it.
[time=429] It's primarily a musical event. I think I'm a musician more than I am a drama person, so we add some touches of interest other than music.
[time=441] But primarily it's a concert with the sanctuary choir of our church, all members of our choir singing in this, and it involves...
[time=449] We're pretty sure there'll be at least 400 to 450 people from our church doing something with the tree before we're finished.
[time=457] How long ago did you start thinking about the musical program that is in this year's tree?
[time=465] Well, it's kind of a habit with me all the time, and I have some songs that we're singing this year that I found three years ago.
[time=475] But part of it has to do with a theme that you put together or a style of a particular piece, and you say, "I want to use this at some point," so you tuck it away in your file, and you go through.
[time=485] And a lot of it is done. I try to be done by August with everything that I want to do for this year.
[time=490] So some of it's accumulation over several years, and right after the tree is done, often the new publishers release their music around March or April, so I go to a clinic, or I get a hold of this music and listen to it, and just see what I can find.
[time=504] There's a man named Robert Sterling of all names. He calls his program the Sterling Christmas.
[time=511] We've used a lot of his music this year. He's a wonderful arranger. I've not met him, and I've not seen his name very often, but we have taken a lot of his individual pieces and put it together.
[time=524] And sometimes we take a contato that somebody has written, and use it all in its entirety, or we'll take three or four as we've done this year and just piece it together with our own thought in mind.
[time=535] Through the years you must have had some humorous events that go on that maybe only you would have been aware of or a few around you. Would you share a few of those with us?
[time=544] Well, some of the people at different heights, obviously, in size, so we have used, and thankfully from Pepsi Cola, we've gotten some wood cartons that we put under some of the people so that they can stand a little taller.
[time=559] Occasionally, those boxes are weaker than we think they are, and during the middle of a performance, a young lady might drop as much as four or five inches because they go think down through the middle, makes this big snap on all of a sudden you just see the top of their heads over the tree.
[time=573] We've had some different situations where people have dropped, they take bottles of water and it's dropped all the way down from the top of the tree down to the bottom.
[time=587] Some very unusual things, there are some things that I don't know about that go on in the tree that the choir gets a big kick out of. Occasionally, the water bottles are used for more than drinking, occasionally they're used to pour on somebody else.
[time=600] When they are volunteers and they spend that much time, there's a bit of fellowship and humor that goes into it too. It's really great.
[time=608] What's really become your Christmas hasn't it? I mean, it's the focus of this time of year for you, it's what you give your life to at this point.
[time=615] It really is an opportunity because hearts are really warm, I think, to the gospel that is the birth of Jesus and His death and resurrection and the purpose of it.
[time=625] I think that's really important that if we have this opportunity to have people come, we've added one more concert this year so we're expecting it's already a sell out.
[time=634] We're expecting about 22,000 and it's just my opportunity as well as all of our church people to invite their friends to tell them what we really believe in.
[time=644] And oftentimes throughout the year, people are sensitive to the christian witness of a fellow worker from our church.
[time=651] And this is a chance to see them in action and say, "Hey, we believe in this. We really believe that Christ was born literally."
[time=658] And that he died on the cross to save our sins. He took our place and paid that penalty that we can believe on him and accept that free gift.
[time=667] We can have really a truly white Christmas in our hearts.
[time=670] [AMEN] I'm thankful for your ministry and I get the privilege to share the gospel each one of those performances and I'm thankful for that.
[time=678] And I would ask you folks who love the Lord and are thankful for our ministry to be praying for me as I find words to express the love of Christ.
[time=687] Russell, we've sent a letter out and it has to do with the Bible Hour. This is the year end and God has been really good to us.
[time=694] Our Founders Club members have been very faithful in giving to the Bible Hour.
[time=700] But I just want to take a moment and more or less remind you that you have the opportunity.
[time=706] They have the opportunity to give toward purchasing some new equipment that we need. It's important for us to have equipment that is on key every week so that we can present to you the Bible Hour.
[time=721] And sometimes things aren't completely broken down but they are in disrepair and we have to kind of nudge it a little bit to make it work.
[time=729] So we're asking you to consider giving us a gift to the Bible Hour at the end of the year here so that we can continue this fund that is growing slowly and we've got money and reserve hoping to purchase some new equipment to make our program as effective as we possibly can.
[time=744] If you have an opportunity to write to us and you receive that letter of request why don't you consider giving a gift today and sending it to the Bible Hour.
[time=759] [MUSIC]
[time=777] Just the time I feel that I've been caught in my own self.
[time=789] And just the time I feel my mind is in water why won't we wait?
[time=801] That's when the grace begins to blow my mind.
[time=809] And all my worldly wonderings just do not go too well.
[time=825] I want to know you, I want to know you, to feel your heart, to know your mind.
[time=843] I want to know you, I want to know you, oh I want to know you, oh I want to know you.
[time=865] [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=981] Thank you, Bev, for beautifully singing a central theme in our Christian faith to know God, to know Christ even as Paul and Philippians chapter 3 said that I might know Him.
[time=999] Our walk with Christ is ultimately a personal relationship, isn't it?
[time=1005] Well let's take our Bibles this morning and open to the book of Revelation.
[time=1011] We're studying this book and we have come to a section of it, two chapters really, chapters 2 and 3, which are about the seven churches that are in Asia Minor.
[time=1023] The book is all about Jesus Christ and it opened in chapter 1 with a vision of the glorified Jesus Christ and it showed Him in and amongst the lampstands or moving in and amongst His church.
[time=1035] And then as if having set the stage for that, these seven churches follow in line and He goes to each of the lampstands, each of the churches and these are real historical churches with real people in them living in real cities.
[time=1049] And He evaluates them, this is about 90 AD and He makes comment about their ministry, the strengths and the weaknesses in it.
[time=1057] The island of Patmos is just off the coast of Asia Minor across the Aegean Sea, that is where the writer of this book, the human author of this book, the Apostle John is.
[time=1067] He's received it through Revelation from Jesus Christ, assisted by angels in this and the letter is carried back across the Aegean Sea and it begins at Ephesus.
[time=1076] That was the first church that we looked at and this is the church that has left its first love.
[time=1082] They have left their first love, they are the church of cold orthodoxy, they have the truth, they know the truth, they understand the truth but it doesn't mean anything to them anymore.
[time=1090] They're not fired up about it, they're not living for it, it's not the consuming passion of their life.
[time=1096] We left Ephesus and went about 35 miles to the north along the Aegean coast and came to a city called Smirna and Smirna is the persecuted church.
[time=1106] Smirna happens to be in a city where they are zealously observing emperor worship and it has refined the church and purified the church.
[time=1114] Such that Smirna of the seven churches listed is only one of two that have no condemnation. The Lord makes no rebuke against this church.
[time=1122] He doesn't ask them to correct anything, he doesn't point out any of their weaknesses because as we understood from our study of that the suffering and the persecution had purged off all of the excesses and the licentiousness or the sin and the bad doctrine.
[time=1136] It's all gone by virtue of this intense persecution so they stand without condemnation.
[time=1143] To get to this next church we would travel again northward about 35 miles along the coast of the Aegean Sea and then make an abrupt right and go inland for about 10 or 15 miles and come to the city of Pergamum.
[time=1157] Let's read what our Lord says to them in chapter 2 verses 12 through 17.
[time=1164] "And to the angel of the church in Pergamum right, the one who has the sharp two-edged sword says this, 'I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is, and you hold fast my name and did not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas, my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells."
[time=1188] Verse 14, "But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balam, who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel to eat things sacrifice to idols and to commit acts of immorality.
[time=1204] Thus you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolayitans.
[time=1209] Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
[time=1214] He who has any ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches, to him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new name written on the stone which no one knows, but he who receives it."
[time=1230] To set our thinking for the situation and the atmosphere in which this church was surviving, let me draw to your thinking something about your own personal life.
[time=1240] Have you ever noticed that sometimes Satan will tempt you to sin in very overt and obvious ways?
[time=1248] He'll try to draw you into obvious disobedience, and there are times in your life when you will successfully resist that temptation and say no to it.
[time=1260] But then you notice that he has gone from the front door of your house to the back door of your house, and he is sneaking in that way with instead of obvious invitation to obvious sin and invitation quietly to subtle compromise.
[time=1274] Small things, little things, things that don't rank on the heavy hit or ten list of all time bad sins, but definitely sin, definitely compromise of your Christian faith and walk with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1289] He attempts, I believe, to do that in order that having made sufficient compromise from the back door, you'll eventually feel so overwhelmed with your sin and your guilt because they kind of add up and you're thinking, and you say, well, what in the world, I may as well just be involved now in overt sin.
[time=1306] Well, he couldn't take you with a frontal attack of obvious sin, he slowly works his way into your life through the back door of compromise until you're eventually overcome with the feelings of guilt and compromise, and you just give up the fight altogether.
[time=1319] It's a little bit like trying to die it in the holidays.
[time=1323] We all, I think, approach the holidays with real resolution, not to gain that five or ten pounds. I guess some of us are mature enough just to say, well, here comes five or ten pounds and I won't feel bad about it.
[time=1333] But some of us are still trying to fight our way through this thing without gaining too much weight, and so at that first obvious opportunity to have a second portion or to load the gravy on extra, or take that second piece of pumpkin pie and ice cream, you just say no, and you feel as though you've resisted and you're off to a good start.
[time=1349] But then later in the evening, you walk by that little dish with those M&Ms in it. You grab a few of those, and you pop those down, nobody seemed to notice, you don't see any immediate change in your body, and so you move on.
[time=1362] Shortly thereafter, there's a cookie laying there, and you grab that one, and then there's an extra bite of somebody else's ice cream that they happen to be enjoying, and just help yourself to that, and on it goes until finally in your mind, you know you've overeat so much already.
[time=1376] Well, we'll just have that second piece of pie. You know what I'm saying? We live that, don't we?
[time=1381] And by the third or fourth day of the holiday, we're just powering food. We are into the power mode.
[time=1387] That is what Satan is trying to do here to this church. He has knocked on the front door. He has invited them to compromise on significant doctrine.
[time=1396] They have said no to the point of even martyrdom. But as you've noticed in our reading in verse 13, they are at the very throne of Satan, and we'll talk about that in a minute.
[time=1408] And he is unwilling to have them stand strong for their faith, so failing with this front attack, he goes around the back door of their life, and he is finding ways to corrupt them through subtle compromise.
[time=1423] His hope and intention is that the people then will eventually be so consumed with personal sin in their own lives, that they will no longer tolerate doctrine and truth from the pulpit, from the preaching, and from their doctrinal statement.
[time=1437] And the whole church collapses under its own weight. That is his method. That is what he is doing to this church. And he is having some success, which is why Christ calls them to repentance.
[time=1449] Let's follow the flow of our Lord's thought. As he assesses this church, according to the little outline that we've been following these seven points, I'll give them to you as we go. We begin with the correspondent.
[time=1460] And as is typical in ancient documents, the letter writer identifies himself at the beginning, not the end of the letter, as we do in our day.
[time=1469] Verse 12, "And to the angel of the church at Pergamum right, the one who has the sharp two-edged sword says this."
[time=1477] Now, as you remember, he draws for the description of his person from the vision that he gave in chapter 1.
[time=1484] In verse 16 of chapter 1, a part of this vision, he says, "And in his hand, he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword."
[time=1494] This is indeed none other than Jesus Christ. But you say to yourself, "Why does he use this part of the picture of his glorified state? Why this the Christ who has the sharp two-edged sword?"
[time=1507] What we don't know for sure, there might be two reasonable thoughts on this. The first is that Pergamum being the capital of Rome, their Roman province there, of Asia Minor. This is the capital city in that province.
[time=1520] They have been given what they call the "right of the sword." They need not appeal to Caesar to execute capital punishment.
[time=1530] They could execute at will. And it may be that the Lord is saying, "You people are living in a city where your governing officials appeal to no one before they execute capital punishment."
[time=1540] But I want to remind you that as Jesus Christ, I am the one ultimately who says, "Yes or no about life and death matters."
[time=1546] I am the sovereign of capital punishment. I have the ultimate power over life and death. All that belongs to me.
[time=1554] At the same time, it may be that he is warning them that he is capable of bringing judgment on them if they don't stop their compromise.
[time=1564] Look at verse 16, chapter 2, "Repent therefore or else I am coming to you. And I will make war against them, probably those will see, who are falling into compromise, with the sword of my mouth."
[time=1578] The sword of my mouth is a picture of judgment. And he may be saying, "I am going to come and bring severe judgment upon you and your church if you don't reverse this trend of compromise with evil."
[time=1590] So the correspondence. Secondly, the city. What kind of a city is Pergamum? Well, it's different than Ephesus and Smirna, both of which were located on the Aegean Sea with thriving harbours, making them cities of great commercial interest.
[time=1604] Pergamum instead was a center of political power and intellectual pursuit. The political power resided in Pergamum. By this time, the writing of this letter, they had been the Roman capital of Asia Minor for some 250 years.
[time=1619] They were strongly established as the center of Roman power in Asia Minor. They were also given to literary interests or intellectual pursuits.
[time=1630] They had the second largest library in the known world. They had a library of some 200,000 volumes, which doesn't sound all that large until you remember that there were no printing presses in that day.
[time=1641] And so every one of these books, every one of these volumes in this library there at Pergamum had been hand copied. They were in that sense an original.
[time=1650] They did that by writing on Papyrus, which is a plant that grows in kind of the still waters of the Nile River in Egypt. So they were importing all this Papyrus in order to make all these books.
[time=1661] But the leadership of Egypt got wind of it and they didn't want the library of Alexandria to be rivaled in any way, shape or form and number.
[time=1669] And so they cut off the supply of Papyrus to Pergamum and so Pergamum by its own name invented its own writing instrument or receiving paper and it was animal-skins.
[time=1680] They invented and perfected the art of writing not on Papyrus, but on parchment or manufactured from animal skins.
[time=1689] So it's a thriving city full of political power and intellectual pursuit.
[time=1694] The church. What about the church? Well, again, we know next to nothing about the church except what is written in these short verses. It's not recorded for us anywhere else in Scripture.
[time=1705] How did it start? We don't know for sure. In Acts chapter 16 verse 8, there is mention of Paul heading into the area of Mysea, the region of Mysea.
[time=1715] And Pergamum was a city inside that region. So he may have gone to that city, but we don't know for sure.
[time=1721] Our best guess is Acts 19 when Paul spent three years at Ephesus. It says there his preaching went out over all of Asia.
[time=1728] And so his own preaching and those he had brought to Christ traveling no doubt took the gospel as seed and planted it there and the church began and has grown.
[time=1738] We learn most about the church as usual through the commendation and the condemnation. Verse 13, his commendation of this church.
[time=1747] I know where you dwell where Satan's throne is and you hold fast My name and did not deny my faith.
[time=1756] To Ephesus, look at verse 2, he says, I know your deeds. To Smirna, verse 9, I know your tribulation.
[time=1768] But to Pergamum, verse 13, I know where you dwell. I know where you live. It's a word of permanence, permanent dwelling.
[time=1778] And it is there unfortunate lot in life to be dwelling, to be permanently located at the very foot of Satan's throne, verse 13.
[time=1787] You dwell where Satan's throne is. You say, what is that? Well, we had a synagogue of Satan at the church of Smirna, verse 9.
[time=1797] But here we have the very throne of Satan. I believe it is his headquarters. It is the place of his authority. It is the place where he is the home base for his operations.
[time=1807] You say, well, can you describe that? Can you define that? No, not much. The Bible doesn't help us a whole lot with that. It just seems to be that he is centered there.
[time=1815] He is located there. This is the base point out of what he is working in the world today or in that day. And though we can't explain much how he was doing it, there is tremendous evidence of his success in this particular city.
[time=1830] It comes in three different forms. The first was Emperor worship. You remember Smirna was kind of the zealous city in Asia Minor for Emperor worship? Well, they were actually second to Pergamum.
[time=1840] Pergamum of all the cities in Asia Minor had first built a temple to Emperor worship. It was 29 B.C. and it was to the Emperor Augustus. And they have been zealous in this pursuit.
[time=1852] They are the leading city. As you note, Antipas has died at the hands of these people. He has been martyred for his faith.
[time=1862] So this is the flagship of Emperor worship in Asia Minor. It's a respectable form of idolatry. It's a politically expedient form of idolatry.
[time=1873] So that's form one. Form two is in Greek mythology. And there is here in this city the largest, most beautiful or nate temple of Zeus, who is the head of the Greek pantheon of gods.
[time=1886] And so around him are all various sorts of other types of Greek gods. But he is kind of the leader of all the Greek gods in Greek mythology.
[time=1895] And as you would approach the city of Pergamum, you would come across a flat plain and view the city rising up out of this flat plain a mountain of about a thousand feet tall.
[time=1907] And so it actually almost looked like a throne, which may be some of the imagery that John is using here, the throne of Satan. It just kind of just sat there and seemed to have a level top.
[time=1916] But at the top of it there was even a knoll that was higher than all the others. And that is the very knoll that highest point in all the city where they built this marvelous temple for Zeus.
[time=1926] So as you approach this city, you look as if you're coming to a throne and the one exonerated at the top of it was Zeus.
[time=1934] Then another form, and this is almost laughable for we who know the Bible, for we who have read Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
[time=1943] It was their worship of Escalapius. This is yet another god, but they were most famous, not for Emperor worship and not for Zeus, but for Escalapius because Escalapius was a god of healing, they believe.
[time=1956] People would come from far and wide with physical sickness, to the city of Pergamum, to find healing for their physical ailments and diseases.
[time=1966] Escalapius was personified as a god holding a snake. As a god holding a snake, and even to this day the medical emblem has a snake entwined in it.
[time=1981] You say, "Well, how did you worship Escalapius?" You came to the temple and you fed snakes. That was how you worshiped. You'd buy little food and you'd feed these snakes.
[time=1992] Now, it's reported that this temple of Escalapius was literally covered, the floor of this temple was literally covered with thousands and thousands of non-poisonous, harmless snakes.
[time=2006] And so you would worship by feeding these snakes. Now, if you were sick and you needed to be healed, they would have you sleep in the temple all night.
[time=2016] You would lie down on the floor in hopes that these snakes would come in contact with your body and at that point of contact you would receive the healing which you sought.
[time=2028] One commentator said at this way, "You would be healed as the diffused multiplicity of the deity of Escalapius crawled over your body and infused you with his healing power."
[time=2039] It's laughable. I mean, this is Satan being worshiped by people who are worshiping snakes. The form he took in Genesis 3 to deceive Adam and Eve.
[time=2050] So it's bizarre. Satan has a stronghold here. Satan has just pulled the stops out on false religious system and he offers it to the politically expedient, mature, sophisticated folks in Emperor worship.
[time=2064] He offers it to the mysterious mystical folks in Greek mythology and he offers it in the overt form of snake worship in the temple of Escalapius.
[time=2074] But if there ever a time when the words of our Lord would echo, "I will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it." It would be to this little church at Pergamum because they have done a phenomenal job in standing against this false worship system. Look at it in verse 13.
[time=2089] He says, "I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is and you held fast one my name and two you didn't deny my faith."
[time=2098] Those are two central things in our Christian walk. Number one, my name, the name of Christ. And of course we're not talking about Jesus Christ as if there was power in that little name itself.
[time=2109] We're talking about all that is brought into being with the person of Jesus Christ. All of his character, all of his attributes, all that he stands for, all that he is.
[time=2117] When you talk about a person's name, you talk about their reputation and their personhood and their accomplishments and their gifts and what they stand for.
[time=2125] And what he is saying here is, "Satan came knocking on the front door of your lives through persecution trying to get you to make me into a different Jesus but you refused."
[time=2135] And if you know anything about cults, if you know anything about false doctrines and false religious systems, they will always pervert who Jesus Christ is.
[time=2143] They will offer you Jesus but it will be a different Jesus. It won't be the Jesus of the New Testament or the Old Testament. It won't be truly God in human flesh.
[time=2152] They will make him something less. And apparently they were trying to do that to this church and the church said no.
[time=2157] We are holding fast to the Jesus Christ we know of from the gospels which they surely would have had and would have understood.
[time=2167] Secondly, he says that they held fast too or didn't deny my faith which is the essence of how to be saved.
[time=2174] And that too is the common perversion inside a cults. They not only offer you a different Jesus but they offer you something other than salvation by grace through faith. They make works necessary in one form or another.
[time=2186] They are always adding works and works and more works. And these people said no. We don't believe that. We don't agree with that. We refuse to do that.
[time=2194] And so they are commended. Under severe opposition they held fast to the person of Jesus Christ as the true and living son of God and they refused to accept any other way of salvation but by grace through faith.
[time=2208] They held to the major tenants of their faith.
[time=2213] Consequently some of them died. One of them is named Antipas. Do you see him in verse 13? You did not deny my faith. Even in the days of Antipas my witness and my faithful one who was killed among you.
[time=2226] We don't know who he was. May have been their pastor. May have been a great strong Christian leader in the secular world but he was certainly out front and he was refusing to compromise the name of Christ or the faith of Christ.
[time=2237] And as a result he was killed. History tells us they put him in a bowl, a brass bowl of some size that they had made and it was hollow on the inside. They stuck him in there, closed it off and built the fire on it and they cooked him to death.
[time=2250] So he died for his faith. It's interesting. You'll note in verse 13 he is called my witness. The Greek word there is "Martous" and it has gone through an interesting metamorphous through the centuries.
[time=2263] It is often times translated not witness but martyr because so many of the early church witnesses became martyrs. And to be one was eventually to be the other and you see that transformation happening in the life of Antipas.
[time=2276] He went from a witness in this verse to being a martyr in this verse. So he stood strong and refused.
[time=2284] As I was studying this week I couldn't help but notice the four times the word "my" shows up in verse 13, my name, my faith, my witness, my faithful one.
[time=2296] And hearing the very personal nature of our relationship with Christ and his willingness to totally identify with us as his witness and as his faithful one.
[time=2308] So the corresponded as Christ. The city is Pergamum. The church, don't know much about it, fledgling but strong. Commended because it refused to compromise the name or the identity of Christ and the essence of salvation.
[time=2324] Now we move to the condemnation and you look at verse 14 he says "but."
[time=2331] But despite all I've said positive, there are these negative things. I have a few things against you because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balam who kept teaching Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel to eat things sacrifice to idols and to commit acts of immorality.
[time=2351] Then verse 15 another form of heresy. Thus you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolayetans. You say what's going on here? What's the problem?
[time=2362] These folks are compromising to sensual sin. They are becoming accommodating of sensual practices both taught and practiced in their church. They are becoming worldly.
[time=2379] Satan as we have noted has been trying to battle them at the front door with the identity of Christ and how you get saved. He can't win so he goes around the back door and starts to pollute these people through the door of passion and lust and desire and sensuality.
[time=2394] And what he is hoping is that they will compromise their personal integrity to the extent that they no longer will stand for the faith of Jesus Christ and the person of Jesus Christ because by the way if you're living in sin Christ is a very confronting figure and his doctrine is very confronting.
[time=2411] And so what happens is people corrupt themselves personally and privately and then they refuse to tolerate clear teaching on Christ in the Word of God. You say now what do you mean? Well look at that again. Verse 14, "Balam." We don't have time to go back to the Old Testament and read Numbers 22 to 25. That's where the story is basically recorded.
[time=2430] In there you would find a king by the name of Balak. He's the king of a neighboring nation by the name of Moab and he wants to destroy Israel. And he can't do it. He tries but he didn't know how. So he finds out that Balam who's kind of a prophet for hire is available.
[time=2446] And so he offers Balam and an inordinate amount of money and says, "Will you put a curse on the nation of Israel?" And Balam says, "I'll try." So after he and his jackass make their way past the angel of the Lord with his sword that is drawn if you remember your Sunday school lessons.
[time=2461] He goes to a place where he can overlook the armies of Israel and he tries to curse him. But the Lord won't let him curse him. Three different times he tries and he's unsuccessfully can't do it.
[time=2470] But he's really hungry for all that money that's being offered him by the king of Moab. So he says to the king, "Well, we can't get him this way, but I got another way."
[time=2481] If you'll send your daughters, the daughters of the nation of Moab, to be seductive and enticing, to draw the men of the nation of Israel into sexual relationship,
[time=2494] they will eventually marry those women. When they marry those women, they will eventually worship their false gods, your gods, the gods of Moab.
[time=2502] They'll lose their strength and priority place in the kingdom of God and you can overrun them.
[time=2509] Knock, knock on the front door of the door, shut. The people of Israel would never have laid down their arms to Balak.
[time=2514] The people of Israel in one great moment never would have bowed the knee to Moab and the gods of Moab.
[time=2520] Nothing gonna work. So Satan goes around to the back and entices them to compromise who they are and what they are slowly and surely through immoral illicit sensual desires.
[time=2532] And it worked. That's exactly what happened.
[time=2538] Verse 15. The New Testament period, we move from the Old Testament type of back door to the front, to the back door of the New Testament.
[time=2545] Verse 15. Thus you also have some who in the same way hold the teaching of the Nicolayethans.
[time=2550] Now again, we study them when we look at the church at Ephesus. We don't know a lot about them. Some would suggest that Nicholas, one of the deacons that are appointed in the book of Acts,
[time=2558] watered away from the faith and started this false religious system, can't prove it, don't know.
[time=2563] What we do know from history is that they were licentious, that they were sensual, that they were ungodly, that they were given the orgies and all the rest.
[time=2571] And they were saying that you could be a Christian and live that way. They were saying that you could name Christ and name the doctrines of Christ and not give up on the faith and not be called anything other than a Christian.
[time=2586] So, we believe that there would have been some in Pergamum who were preaching and really even living immorality and these probably fringe people that were finding leaders, finding people who articulate this doctrine of immorality and working like Levin, bringing its way into this church at Pergamum which here to four had stood so strong even in the face of persecution and opposition.
[time=2610] They were even possibly advocating inner marriage with the unbelievers of the city of Pergamum.
[time=2618] So, while the core of the church had been strong, the leadership of the church had been faithful to the point even of death.
[time=2625] They couldn't bring themselves to be accountable for all that was going on inside their church and so they were tolerating immorality and they were tolerating leaders of immorality under the heading of Baileum and Nicolayethans.
[time=2639] So, the real grievous sin here, their compromise is that of tolerating sin in the church. They had the very prevalent attitude that's not my responsibility.
[time=2649] I'm not doing that. I haven't done those things. I don't teach that way but as you envision the city of Pergamum, there wouldn't have been one big church they all met out.
[time=2660] It would have been a number of different house churches and the leadership in some of these house churches was getting when that immorality was creeping in and false doctrine was creeping in and they were content just to stay in their own little church and their own little body of fellowship and say we're not doing it so it's not our fault and we're not responsible for it.
[time=2679] And the Lord didn't think that that was the right approach as you'll read in verse 16. He says repent.
[time=2686] Change your mind about that. Repent therefore or else I am coming to you quickly and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
[time=2695] Granted you're not doing the sensual stuff. Granted you're not teaching the false doctrines but it's your responsibility to preserve the purity of the church by seeking these people out and holding them accountable.
[time=2709] What would it look like? It would be restoration of sinning brothers and sisters and their leaders who have fallen into sensuality. Correct their doctrine and correct their lifestyle.
[time=2721] I'd never ever in my life understood this passage to support the notion of church discipline in Matthew 18 and Galatians 6 but as you study it there's no other conclusion to draw what he means when he says repeat is to be involved in the discipline process of Matthew 18.
[time=2735] You're called in the discipline process and restorative process of Galatians 6. You are accountable. Church is not a forum for people to come and live any way they want to live.
[time=2744] The church is not a forum for people to come and teach anything they want to teach. We are not just this big mutual brotherhood of friendships held together by the bombs of love whereby we tolerate anything and everything under the sun.
[time=2755] Lest we fear we offend someone. That is what those men were teaching who advocated Baylam and the Nicolaeotans. And Jesus says that is not true. Repent. Change your mind. Hold them accountable. Process these people according to the pattern of Matthew 18.
[time=2775] And they either repent or you put them out of your church. And he says if you don't do that I'm coming. I'm coming with a sword. I'm coming to cut your head off as would have been the lot of Baylam had the ass not stopped.
[time=2796] So lastly then the council and this is intriguing. Look at this verse 17. He who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches.
[time=2808] You know he's doing here at the end of every letter he says this. If you have an ear please listen to me. Listen to me in a personal way. Don't just listen to a sermon. Let this stuff penetrate your heart.
[time=2821] What he's saying to you today in our church is understand that that compromise in your life will lead you to greater compromise in your life.
[time=2832] And you will eventually bring yourself to a place that you will tolerate. Absolute sin not only in your own life but in this church.
[time=2842] In other words this church is purity. Black eye Baptist church this church is strength for the name of Christ and the faith of Christ begins with your personal purity with your unwillingness to compromise your obedience to Christ.
[time=2858] Because as you stand strong personally then you will not tolerate anything else in the public forum.
[time=2865] But if you compromise privately you will become incredibly irritated by a public stand for truth and you'll eventually undermine the commitment of the church to accommodate your sinful lifestyle.
[time=2879] And the church will be swept away.
[time=2883] This really is a call. He is saying listen to me. Given here to what I've said. What he is saying is live a pure and godly life in the private parts of your life. Refuse to compromise in the small things and stand strong and refuse to tolerate evil in your own life and in the life of this church.
[time=2904] And he says if you do that verse 17 to him who overcomes and as you remember the overcomer is just another word for being a Christian. To those who are Christians, to those who faithfully endure. I will give him some of the hidden mana.
[time=2918] You say what is hidden mana? Well we don't know. Mana of course is that bread from heaven in the Old Testament that the children of Israel ate in their sojourning.
[time=2927] It was kind of a white flaky maybe honey flavored beautiful gift from God showed up every morning they could have all they wanted of it disappeared came again fresh in the morning.
[time=2937] You say why is he saying it's hidden? Well here's a guess. Take it or leave it. John 651 speaks of Christ as the bread of life. He is the mana of life.
[time=2948] And it may be that he is saying I will give to you the hidden mana who Christ is hidden to an unregenerate world unbelievers don't acknowledge Christ they don't see Christ they don't recognize him as anything other than a teacher or some great figure in world history they don't recognize him as the true and living God to them Christ is hidden.
[time=2966] And it may be here that Christ is pictured as the hidden mana and they will partake of the life which comes from partaking of the hidden mana.
[time=2975] Then he goes on to say and I will give him a white stone and a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it again just guessing at the white stone can't prove it to you.
[time=2987] Some suggest that it may be one of those stones in the breastplate of the high priest possible others say it may be a reference to the white stone being the diamond the most precious of all stones and it is a symbolism of eternal life the most precious gift anyone could ever receive.
[time=3003] But a note from history which I tend to lean towards was that in this day and age at the completion of the great Olympic games or the games of Ephesus and the games that would have been held in this city the great victor the people who have in today's lingo gotten the gold medal would have received as a part of their reward and booty and prize a white stone they would have been given that and you say what do they do with it.
[time=3028] That white stone acted as a pass or a ticket to get them entrance into the great celebration of all the dignitaries and the powerful people and the wealthy people of the city at the end of the games they would have a huge festive party.
[time=3043] And it was only the athlete who had the white stone because he had won the game who could show it at the door of entry and be permitted to come in.
[time=3052] It may be a picture of God saying as one who has faithfully endured and run the race of life Hebrews chapter 12 I will give you this stone which grants you entrance into the celebration we know of as heaven.
[time=3069] I don't know any one of those and then it says but we do know and on this stone there'll be a new name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it.
[time=3080] Apparently when you get this stone there'll be a name on it and it'll be a name that only Christ knows and you know and it is likely a new name that he gives you you've heard that Negro spiritual I got a new name.
[time=3093] This is I think where they get that and it may be that at the point of entering into heaven Jesus Christ will give you your own special private name that only you and he will know and it will come written on this white stone.
[time=3105] And people you know they come up to you after a message like this and they say okay I appreciate that you know what is the name on that stone and you say to yourself and to them well I don't know the point is nobody knows.
[time=3116] If I knew then the verse would have to read and I will give him a white stone and a new name written on the stone which no one except Russell more knows and he who receives it.
[time=3124] There is no way to know that's the point it's private between you and Christ it's a special name that is given to you on that white stone as you conclude the race of life.
[time=3138] As we draw this time together around God's word to a close I just want to say a few things one again to you who are tempted to compromise and think that it only relates to you it doesn't compromise of sin though private though undisclosed for a time the minor.
[time=3160] Sin is progressive it's like leaven it's often symbolized by leaven where you just put a little bit of it in the in the dough and soon the whole dough has it.
[time=3171] What begins quietly and privately in your life will eventually capture your life and it won't just impact your life but the life of your family in the life of this family as it spreads from you to others in our church.
[time=3187] So be cautious be careful be accountable spend time with people who know you and care for you and with whom you can talk about things in your life to find the strength and the help to walk strong and refuse to compromise.
[time=3202] Secondly I want to talk to you this morning who don't know Christ and if you're here today and you don't know the blessed Lord Jesus Christ and you say what do I mean by that I mean you've never given your life to Christ.
[time=3212] You say no no no I've done that I believe in God and I know that Jesus Christ is God's son and I can even quote a Bible verse or two and I would say this to you so can Satan.
[time=3227] Satan's the exact same he believes God exists he also knows that Jesus Christ is the son of God there's no question in his mind he believes that.
[time=3237] Now if you read Matthew 4 he quote scripture what's the difference between you and Satan what is salvation what does it mean to come to Christ what does it mean to come to the end of that thing in partake of the hidden manner and receive that white stone a pass as it were into the glories of heaven.
[time=3257] Has everything to do with you bending the will of your life under the sovereign rule of God and Jesus Christ.
[time=3265] Has everything to do with you saying I'm a sinner I'm an ungodly individual I have lived my life according to my own way and I repent which means I turn and change and leave and forsake that way of life and I commit myself completely and totally to the person of Jesus Christ fighting forgiveness in him and I will this from this day forward live according to the rule of his word to the best of my ability as I am powered by the spirit of God.
[time=3293] It'll change your life it'll make you new inside it'll give you a love for the brother and things will be different if that has never happened to you and there may be many of you here today who know that God exists and believe that Jesus is the son of God and have your own copy of the Bible.
[time=3313] But unless you've moved into that personal relationship with Christ submitting to his rule and leadership of your life you know different Satan and your end will be no different than Satan's.
[time=3323] You'll both end up in the same place we're going to get their revelation a lake of fire but you can change that today.
[time=3331] The spirit of God is working in your heart I want you to come forward and pray receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and know that when this life is over you will have the stone that will have a new name for you a name that you'll enjoy with just Jesus for all eternity.
