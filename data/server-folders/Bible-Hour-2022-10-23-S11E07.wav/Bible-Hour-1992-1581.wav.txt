[time=0] And I think all it would take is for these special interest groups, instead of attacking various areas where moral absolutes still exist, to tack the one basis itself and say that in order to have employment, you must affirm that there
[time=16] is no one God.
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=39] Have you ever been pressured at work to compromise your faith in Christ?
[time=43] What would you do if to keep your job you were required to worship a false God?
[time=48] How do you think God would respond to you if you made the choice to compromise your faith and keep your job? Today, Pastor Moore will help you think through the answers to these questions as we continue our study in the book of Revelation.
[time=61] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation. We will be looking at chapter 2 verses 18 through 29. Our special
[time=70] music today will feature the Christmas brass and a duet by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe. Let's now join our service.
[time=81] One of the great sounds of Christmas and the Christmas season is that of brass players. We welcome today our brass Christmas brass. We're calling them and they will be playing for us a song. It's entitled Pasadam. Remember this was written a number of years ago by Ralph Carmichael realizing that we need to just start a spark. Keep that spark within us and then share it with others and that's how we continue the fire and the glow of that love that we have for Jesus Christ.
[time=109] So let's listen with that theme in mind as the Christmas brass play for us.
[time=139] [MUSIC - 180 seconds]
[time=329] [APPLAUSE]
[time=337] Thank you, brass. Let's continue with music now as we turn to him number 136. The first know well, 136. The first, second and sixth stands it together.
[time=352] [MUSIC - 242 seconds]
[time=604] [APPLAUSE]
[time=614] Well, thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour today. We're really glad that you tuned in.
[time=620] Russell, we've had a week of a number of people coming into the sanctuary working diligently on the living Christmas tree.
[time=626] And as of this taping, we're just about ready to begin our concerts.
[time=630] And we're going to have 11 concerts this year, previously it's been 10, so you've increased that by 1, so 22,000 people.
[time=638] It's really exciting and many of those are Bible Hour viewers and occasionally we get to see them in the hall or, you know,
[time=644] afterwards are beforehand and I'm just really looking forward to that.
[time=648] Well, that's right. We look forward to your coming and sharing some time with us and maybe get a chance to meet you.
[time=652] And by all means, be in prayer for the salvation of souls that folks come.
[time=658] Don't know Christ, they get to hear this music and I'll present a gospel message very briefly.
[time=662] But hold this time up in prayer that God would work great things in these folks hearts.
[time=666] For those of you that are faithful watchers of the Bible Hour, you no doubt have received a letter asking you to consider giving a year end gift.
[time=674] We want to just encourage you to help us at the end of the year.
[time=678] We have a fund formed for a new equipment. I was in the studio this morning and one of the tape recorders is malfunctioning.
[time=686] And it's important that we keep our equipment up to date and functioning properly.
[time=690] So we're looking forward to purchasing some new equipment.
[time=694] I hope you can help us at the end of the year.
[time=697] And we just mentioned the living Christmas tree. If you send in a gift of $10 or more this month, we'll send you a cassette copy of all the music that is sung at the living Christmas tree.
[time=706] So, just write us at the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=716] And then getting ready for the new year, we'd like to offer to you again the daily walk Bible calendar.
[time=722] This calendar has a key verse from the living Bible and the King James Version.
[time=728] And it has a thought that you can apply to your daily reading and that it has a plan for you to read through the entire Bible in one year.
[time=735] The daily walk Bible calendar is available if you'll just write to us.
[time=739] And once again, just write to the Bible Hour and ask for the calendar at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=750] Once again, we're really grateful for those of you that write in just a little bit of a note and say we're faithfully watching the Bible Hour.
[time=757] Many of you give a request, a prayer request, and we're faithful in praying for those requests. I hope God honors that as we seek to worship the Lord together through the Bible Hour.
[time=768] And also one of the great evenings during the Christmas season is Christmas Eve here, December 24th at 6 p.m. I really love that service.
[time=777] That's going to be an exciting time and we want to extend an invitation to you to come be a part of us and our service that night, December 24th, if your church isn't doing anything.
[time=786] We're going to have a wonderful service of music and then communion.
[time=790] And in many churches, unless you're a member of that church, you're not as welcome at communion, that wouldn't be the case with us.
[time=796] If you're a born-again believer, you love Jesus Christ, you know He's in your heart and you want to celebrate communion with us that night.
[time=803] Stop by, I think you'll have a great time with us.
[time=806] You know Russell, that's a perfect night, particularly if your family gets together to come and it'll only be about an hour long, but we'll have the children in with us.
[time=816] Occasionally we have compartmentalized programs at our church because we think that's right, but this will be a perfect night just to have your children right next to you sitting in the pew to sing together and worship.
[time=826] And I'd like to mention too that Jonathan Birchfield will be with us. Jonathan is probably one of the finest guitarists I've ever heard and his music will be very soothing.
[time=836] He'll be joined by a Marimba cellist and a flutist and there'll be some marvelous music that evening, December 24th, that's Christmas Eve at 6 p.m.
[time=847] So that'll be some exciting events that are taking place. The tree is always a busy time and we look forward to seeing people there and then Christmas Eve is a good time.
[time=858] Russell, I see this question. Do you have your family get together and Christmas Eve or do you make them wait for the next day?
[time=865] Oh, as far as presence, our tradition is to open presence from Heidi's family, my wife's family, Christmas Eve because she's European and that's the European tradition.
[time=876] And then we go the next morning and open presence from my family, my side of the family because that's been my tradition through the year. So we kind of break it up and have fun both times.
[time=885] Well, I hope this is a very special time for your family and keep joining with us as the Bible hours presented to you each week.
[time=892] We're thankful for your faithful presence with us.
[time=922] There is no other name like Jesus.
[time=929] No other name must beautify. Oh, no, there is no other name.
[time=949] No other one. There is no other one like Jesus. No other one can thrill me like God.
[time=967] Oh, no, there is no other one.
[time=978] You may think I sound pretty sure of myself the way I talk to to rest in Jesus like I do.
[time=993] But I've had some hard times. He has always seen me through. And you know I'm certain he'll do the same for you.
[time=1010] No other one. There is no other one like Jesus. No other one will love you like he can.
[time=1028] Oh, no, there is no other one. You may think I sound pretty sure of myself the way I talk to trust in Jesus like I do.
[time=1055] But I've had some hard times. He has always seen me through. And you know I'm certain he'll do the same for you.
[time=1072] No other one. There is no other one like Jesus. No other one will love you like he can.
[time=1090] Oh, no, there is no other one.
[time=1118] Thank you, Kevin and Denise. Don't their voices go together well.
[time=1123] Wonderful, talented people that love the Lord and share their gift with us each opportunity they get. I'm thankful for that.
[time=1132] Are you glad you're saved this morning? Amen. You're glad Jesus is coming back. Amen. Bob Dick, good to hear you here this morning.
[time=1140] I was at Bob Dick's living letters ABF Christmas party last night as was Pastor Chuck and had about 50 people there and they were doing what they do best which is love on each other and eat fine food and have lots of fun.
[time=1156] And then when they were done doing that they started loving on their missionaries so they held their annual auction to raise extra money for their missionaries.
[time=1163] And Chuck was up there leading the bidding and Bob Dick was up there leading the bidding they were just having a great time and they wrote tidying in the eye in there for a couple of those deals but we were excited about that.
[time=1173] And by the time the night was over they'd raise $1,600 to send to the ballots in the Philippines, right? No. Go ahead.
[time=1182] Three of them. Yeah. Okay, watch close. Just had a great time. If you're not in an ABF you need to be because you'll never find a group of people that will love you more
[time=1192] and you'll have more fun with than people in an ABF. So if you haven't checked one of those out yet now is the time because they're doing all their parties and having all their fun and it's easy to break in.
[time=1201] Open your Bibles. Will you let's study the book of Revelation this morning. We're going to come back to a look at these seven churches.
[time=1210] We come this morning to the Church of Thyatira which is the fourth church in this list of seven. It's the smallest of all the cities but it gets the longest letter and they are by the way in the most trouble so far of all the churches we've studied.
[time=1226] Let me try to bridge a gap between Thyatira and Fort Wayne, Indiana this morning by asking you a couple of questions as we get started here.
[time=1236] What would happen if in your workplace in order to keep your job you were required to include in your worship another God besides the God of the Old Testament and Jesus Christ.
[time=1253] What happens if you had to compromise your faith to keep your job? Now it's subtle. It's not like you either forsake and denounce Christ and renounce him and say you're no longer saved or we fire you. No, no, it's not that harsh. It's more subtle.
[time=1268] It's this. Either you acknowledge the fact that there may be another God and another religion that's viable or you lose your job.
[time=1282] You can keep your Christianity. You can hang on to God the Father and you can hang on to God the Son and you can hang on to salvation by grace through faith but in order to work here you have to open up your understanding and have a little broader mind and be able to say that Jesus Christ isn't the only way to God and that he isn't the only way to the only God.
[time=1304] You say could that happen in our country? I think it could. It seems as if the only absolute in this country is that there are no absolutes, right? I mean once we bought into Darwinian evolution said goodbye to God and the moral absolutes that go with God we have basically as a country said the only thing we don't accept is that there's only one thing to accept.
[time=1324] Relativism is the deal of our day and in essence what people are saying is you need to accept everybody else's opinion you need to accept everybody else's way of life and it's okay for you to live your way but don't become narrow minded judgmental and religiously bigoted by saying that your way is the only way.
[time=1344] I think all that has to happen in this country is for these special interest groups who may be running out of their own agendas they're having such incredible success to say hey there's a group of fundamentalists in this country who are really standing against the freedom of religion because they're saying that their religion is the only religion.
[time=1363] And we need to apply pressure on them we need to help them broaden themselves past the fact not make them refuse Christ and refuse their God and give up their Bibles they just need to be broader and accept the fact that there are other guys and unless they're willing to do that they're unacceptable in our society.
[time=1383] What would you do? You're at work or if you're self-employed in order for you to do work with other people you in some form or another had to come to the place that you would not give up Christ and not give up Jesus and your faith in Jesus but be willing to embrace the notion that there may be another God.
[time=1408] Question one question two how do you think Christ would feel how do you think Christ would react if you said yes if you agreed to that if you opened up the parameters of your thinking even if just hypocritically just so you could keep your job.
[time=1427] Said well yeah there may be another God and there may be another way of salvation what would Christ's reaction be to that.
[time=1434] The church of Thyatira was experiencing that exact pressure and we're going to look at that today in our study.
[time=1442] Our study of them will help us understand our own response to that question.
[time=1448] Now you remember Smirna go back a few verses to verse 8 through 11 there they were kind of under the same pressure it was Emperor Worship and unless they bowed down and said that Caesar is Lord and get the certificate then they couldn't function in that society.
[time=1462] And even the Jews were pointing them out and acting as informants and they refused to do that and as a result they went verse 9 into abject poverty they lost all their possessions they had nothing and then in verse 10 some were thrown into prison and some even died.
[time=1477] Smirna is the church that refused to do that to bow down to another God Thyatira is the church that found a way to do it and tried to do it within their Christianity.
[time=1489] So just to show you the development of what's going on here as we move around the horn of these seven churches.
[time=1496] It has been our practice in studying these churches to give you seven main points and we'll do that again this morning and we'll begin with the correspondent and look at Christ as he portrays himself here to the church at Thyatira.
[time=1506] Verse 18 into the angel better translated the messenger of the church in Thyatira write this the son of God who has eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are like burnish bronze.
[time=1519] Now you remember as we move through this book it began with a vision of Christ in chapter 1 and he draws on that vision of himself moving in and amongst the lamp stands to introduce himself in an appropriate way to the needs of that particular church.
[time=1532] In this verse he grabs the fact that he has eyes like a flame of fire and if you remember our study of Revelation chapter 1 you know that those are the eyes like laser eyes that penetrate past the façades past the thin veneer of external Christianity and it can see right to the very essence of motive desire thought the whole thing.
[time=1552] I mean you're naked before him those are the eyes that he uses when he is about to judge people and that is indicated in the fact that he is spoken of here as feet like burnish bronze also he draws that from the vision in chapter 1 and feet are reference to his judgment.
[time=1568] Revelation 19 verse 15 says that he treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God.
[time=1576] So when you hear about the feet of Christ you picture him treading on the fierce wrath of God the wine press of judgment.
[time=1584] So these are the eyes that see perfectly those who should be judged and these are the feet of Christ that will perfectly judge.
[time=1590] Crush people in judgment.
[time=1592] Let us also he's called the son of God that is distinctly different it appears only here in all the book of Revelation in the vision in chapter 1 he was called the son of man.
[time=1602] And there it emphasized that he was the sympathetic high priest that as man he could though while God feel the feelings of man be sympathetic to the problems of man the frailties of man the weaknesses of man and so portrayed as a sympathetic high priest.
[time=1616] Here no not the son of man in this passage full of judgment he is called the son of God that's a messianic title that's a title of deity.
[time=1624] And instead of being the man who sympathizes with weakness this is the God who will not tolerate sin.
[time=1630] So from the get go the readers of this letter the church at Thyatira they know that they are in deep trouble they can feel it.
[time=1638] This is the way he portrays himself to the church at Thyatira.
[time=1644] What then is to be said about the city and I should say I like this city because the people are resilient they fight back they really have no natural resources in this city whatsoever.
[time=1657] This is the city of Thyatira and the only remarkable thing about the city of Thyatira is that there's nothing remarkable about it.
[time=1663] They don't have the temple Diana as they did in Ephesus they don't have the great temple to Zeus as they did in Pergamum they don't have the temple Dias Romas as they did in Smirna no great religious edifice no great something to draw people to visit their city.
[time=1677] This city is 40 miles inland past Pergamum so there about 60 miles off the coast needless to say there is no natural harbor that would draw commerce and business and trade and all the rest of that.
[time=1689] No nice mountain range that would cradle them against the Aegean Sea and give them a beautiful atmosphere with city streets running up the mountain side.
[time=1696] None of that stuff this is just a plain ordinary flat city in the middle of the valley the Kikus Valley.
[time=1705] They had no political power they had no great intellectual pursuits no great libraries. I mean this thing has nothing.
[time=1711] In fact Thyatira for centuries was nothing more than a military outpost.
[time=1718] Enemies entering Asia Minor from the east would attack Asia Minor by eventually getting to Pergamum but in order to do that they had to come down the Kikus Valley.
[time=1726] That was the main thoroughfare for traffic of the size of military movements and so out in the middle of this Kikus Valley is this little city of Thyatira.
[time=1735] But there is nothing there for them to have natural fortification. There aren't any like mountains or rocks there's just this city and they function really as a sacrificial lamb to be a warning signal to the people of Pergamum.
[time=1749] One historian said it this way since Thyatira possessed no natural fortifications it would draw heavily upon the spirit of its soldier citizens to make up for its vulnerability.
[time=1760] In other words the only thing this city had going for it was its own spirit. And as foreign armies would come through they would destroy the city and then they'd attack Pergamum the capital.
[time=1770] And then that conquering nation would then raise Thyatira back up as another outpost as a signal city. Then those people would be wiped out and so for hundreds of years this city just got wiped out and then rebuilt and wiped out and rebuilt.
[time=1782] But they hung on. They kept coming back. So there are resilient people since about 190 BC by this time some 300 years.
[time=1792] Rome had been in charge of Asia Minor and so they had a measure of peace. And in this brief spot of peace they took a hold of the one natural resource they had and they made an entire industry out of it.
[time=1804] You know what it was? It was a root. It was a matter root. A matter root. And from this root out of the ground they could extract a purple dye.
[time=1815] The only other source of this purple dye was a fish, a shellfish called the Murex fish that had to be caught and from one fish could come one drop from his throat of purple dye.
[time=1825] So in the ancient world the color purple and some of you have it on today it's a very stylish color. It was in great demand in the ancient world because it only came from this root and from this little fish.
[time=1837] And the only place really where the root grew up was in Thyatira. And so they built a whole industry out of this, wool workers and leather workers and tanners and potters and bakers and even a slave trade grew up around this little root and its little purple dye.
[time=1852] Bruns missed the whole thing. So their only resource is what they start to grab and extract from the ground they draw the purple dye and they build this whole city of some significant prosperity around this purple dye.
[time=1866] As you might expect being it's an ancient people they then assign a guardian god to all of these different trades. So there was a guardian god to the wool workers and a guardian god to the leather workers and the tanners and so on and so forth.
[time=1881] And these guardian gods were those who would be worshiped and looked to to make sure that the prosperity would continue.
[time=1888] As you might also expect with this guardian god came various festivals and they broke their trades up into what they called guilds which is just another word for association to be like a union today.
[time=1901] They had the union of the wool workers and the union of the leather workers and every union had its own god and every union would have its union festival to its guardian god.
[time=1911] And at this festival the members of this association were required to worship that god to eat meat sacrifice to idols.
[time=1922] And then to participate in the gross immorality that was typical of that idol worship in that day and age all kinds of sexual promiscuity and orgies and the like.
[time=1934] And that's where the rub came with the church at thyatira. The church at Thyatira where did it come from? Well we don't know all we really know about the church is right here in these few verses but you remember Lydia.
[time=1948] Acts chapter 16 verse 14 Lydia was a seller of purple die from the city of Thyatira.
[time=1954] She was no doubt some type of manufacturer's representative who had a cross the aegean sea was found in filipi therefore in Europe so the trade of this little city was extending beyond its own natural barriers over the sea and into Europe and she was a representative of them.
[time=1969] She came into the hearing of the Apostle Paul the gospel penetrated her heart as the chapter says the Lord opened her heart to receive the things of god.
[time=1976] She became a Christian no doubt took her faith back to Thyatira and was an early witness to Christ in that city.
[time=1982] In addition to that Acts 19 tells us that the preaching of Paul while at Ephesus extended into all of Asia and so it was not only her testimony but others like her who would have come to Christ through Paul and neither lived or traveled to Thyatira.
[time=1996] So this little church facing this kind of incredible opposition through demand of the people to be a part of their association their guild and worship false gods.
[time=2008] Fourthly then let's look at the commendation the commendation in verse 19 and this is intriguing he says I know your deeds and your love and faith and service and perseverance and that your deeds of light are greater than at first.
[time=2027] These people are doing quite a work and they're getting better at it they're doing more of it now than they used to do the deeds of light are greater than those at first and the deeds are for in category love which is that self sacrificial movement when your behalf towards someone else to minister to them.
[time=2044] Faith would be that hope and confidence in God the faith that drives a person towards that service which is Greek we're talking about meeting another person's basic needs these people were full of love and full of faith and out of that inner disposition reaching other people's and meeting their needs.
[time=2061] And they were doing it for a long time notice it says their perseverance they were faithful in their faith they kept doing it they were steadfast and as I've noted they got better at it as time grew.
[time=2073] And that brings up an interesting point in other words these people were not saying with their alliance to these gods of the guilds that we reject our faith they weren't saying we're done with Christ they didn't stop coming to church.
[time=2091] In fact they continued in their church I mean last year we had ten living Christmas for performances this year we'll have eleven we will increase our e program will minister to more kids will have two summer Bible classes vacation Bible schools will have more a bf's in other words whatever defined their love whatever to find their faith and their service and their perseverance they were multiplying in it at the same time however.
[time=2117] They were being married and wed to the world.
[time=2122] Notice a distinction here as we move now towards the condemnation you remember at smirna they were attacked from the outside by this emperor worship and particularly by the Jews who were the synagogue of Satan.
[time=2134] They were being attacked from the outside this little church the church of Pergamum they had the unfortunate lot of living at the very throne of Satan and their attacks were primarily from the outside.
[time=2145] Though they were starting to sneak in the back door by the time you come to thayatira there is this corrupt doctrine inside the church this church is no longer with standing pressure from the outside they've bought the bill of goods and it's being articulated and justified for them by someone inside their church.
[time=2164] Camel as you will may have had his nose in the tent at Pergamum he is now firmly situated inside the tent resting comfortably this is a church of great compromise.
[time=2176] If Pergamum was engaged to the world thayatira is married and celebrating anniversaries they're in big big trouble look at verse 20.
[time=2186] But I have this against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess and she teaches and leads my bond servants astray so that they commit acts of immorality and eat things sacrifice to idols.
[time=2202] Nobody really thinks that Jezebel is a real name.
[time=2206] Probably she's been branded by this title because it's these leading them into acts of immorality and things sacrifice to idols which so parallels the Jezebel the Old Testament.
[time=2217] We won't go back there and establish her track record but she was the one who led the nation of Israel into this kind of immorality and idolatrous worship.
[time=2225] So it is likely that this woman now in this church is called Jezebel really branded as Jezebel because of the similarity of her ministry to the ministry of the Jezebel of Old.
[time=2237] Described as a prophet or rather a prophetess in other words she is saying that I have new information from God.
[time=2246] I am the recipient of new revelation beyond what we've already received and based upon this new revelation I will articulate for you the reasons that we should accommodate these guilds and worship these false gods and we'll look at her reasoning in a minute.
[time=2265] But first let me point out four problems that I see here. The first one is that they've got a woman teaching. That's in direct conflict with 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 12 which prohibits women from teaching or exercising authority in the church.
[time=2281] So this church has already sunk to the level of allowing this woman who shouldn't be teaching at all now to call herself a prophetess receive new information from God which then leads not only herself but notice in verse 20 it says bond servants.
[time=2295] That's a distinctly Christian term. You're only called a bond servant when you're a believer. She's even leading the true believers into acts of immorality and things sacrifice to idols.
[time=2305] So problem number one they're in direct violation to the word of God first Timothy 2 12 which they would have had and known about.
[time=2312] Problem number two verse 20 notice but this I have against you that you tolerate this woman Jezebel the word tolerate can sometimes mean man and we don't like this we wish we could get it out but we've learned to live with it but we're waiting for it to be out of our church.
[time=2329] That's not what this one means tolerate means to accept here to embrace we have fully accepted we have been indoctrinated we are not only in a sense tolerating we're accepting and adhering to and propagating and embracing this false doctrine.
[time=2348] Problem three might have been the content of her teaching and it's nowhere explicitly stated what she taught the result of her teaching acts of immorality and things sacrifice to idols but let me give you a few options here.
[time=2362] She may have said something like this.
[time=2366] Now keep in mind fellow believers that these gods of these guilds are man made we know from the word of God there's only one God.
[time=2378] So what they are presenting here is a figment of their imagination there is nothing to it there's nothing substantial there and so therefore what could the harm be.
[time=2388] And acknowledging or permitting the notion that there may be another God when in fact we know from the word there is no other God and God knows we know there is no other God.
[time=2398] So maybe there's room for us to tolerate that to accept that to sign a piece of paper so we can keep our jobs in the workplace.
[time=2408] It may have even gotten a little stronger she may have said this way now listen Christians you need your job right.
[time=2416] I mean without your job you can't pay you can't provide for your family the Bible says you don't provide for your family you're worse than an infidel.
[time=2422] I mean you're worse than a heretic you're worse than an unbeliever.
[time=2426] We've got to provide for our families this is the city that God has called us to live in and this is where we need to provide for our families.
[time=2433] So really we've got to do that and by the way what do you think would happen to the opinion of Christ in this city if all of us just walked off the job because we wouldn't worship these false gods.
[time=2446] I mean we would put the name of Christ and disrepute they think we're all a bunch of lazy sluggards that don't care for our families.
[time=2453] I mean we would become the outcast of Fort Wayne and what would happen if all of us forced into that pressure to walk away from our places of employment not to the night Christ not to reject Christ not to reject God but simply to say that we accept the notion of other gods as viable and we no longer proclaim that Jesus Christ is the only way to salvation.
[time=2475] If we all walked off the job for that she would say to them what would what would people think and then she might have out of this and by the way God has ultimately concerned with your spirit right.
[time=2486] I mean God looks at the heart and the fact that you may eat with your mouth the material food that was offered to a nothing idle but in your heart you know that that's not a real idle.
[time=2497] What differs is it make what you do with your body and so it may involve some immorality. I mean that would just be your body and God cares about your heart and as long as your heart is with God what you do with your body is of no consequence.
[time=2510] Don't know if that's what she said but it's likely something like that I would fall right in line with the what they call historical philosophical dualism where they try to separate between the body as matter and the spirit and say you can do anything you want with your body because it's evil and it doesn't matter.
[time=2526] Whatever it was she was teaching she was successful it was embraced in total or in mass basically by the church not that everyone accepted it but the vast majority did and you have hints of that verse 20 I've already explained they tolerated it they embraced it.
[time=2540] Also in verse 20 even true believers in the church were taking a hold of it called bond servants and then look at verse 23 he's apparently concerned that they're getting a reputation for this kind of false doctrine among other churches.
[time=2554] Excuse me he says I will call her children kill her children with pestilence and all the churches will know that I am he who searches the minds and the hearts.
[time=2564] So there is a guess a reputation building about Fiat Ira that they have found a justifiable way through this prophetus with new information from God to find an easier path so that you can accommodate these false gods and not have to lose your job your reputation and all the rest.
[time=2583] Problem number four is with Jezebel herself look at in verse 21 he says and I give her time to repent and she does not want to repent of her immorality.
[time=2597] Now we don't know exactly how the Lord got to her and communicated this with her it was probably through the apostle John who was ministering in this very area before he was exiled to the island of Patmos and John may have gone to her on behalf of the Lord and said what you're doing is wrong.
[time=2611] You think you've received information from heaven it's not true you're not a prophetess and you have no business teaching and leading this church and by the way there is no way to accommodate the one and only true God with embracing these other gods.
[time=2624] So he apparently communicated to her that you're wrong you're misled and you need to repent and gave her it says some time to do that we don't know how long I gave her time to repent.
[time=2635] But then it goes on to say in verse 21 she don't want to she in the Greek she is still of the disposition not to repent.
[time=2643] She is still not wanting to turn from her sin she continues not to want to turn to God but instead to follow in her immorality the immorality of her teaching and her own practice.
[time=2655] She was undoubtedly involved in this immorality of this illicit sex and leading the way in that kind of thing being an example.
[time=2664] So she would have been one inside the church who claims to be a Christian who claims to have divine direct revelation from God that justifies worshipping false gods and being involved in the idolatrous sexual illicit practices of that idolatry.
[time=2682] I gave her time to repent she didn't want now if you want to know how Christ responds look at verses 22 and 23.
[time=2691] And this will bring to light why he describes himself as the one with eyes of fire and the feet of burnish bronze behold take note he says be alert don't miss this I will cast her upon a bed of sickness.
[time=2706] I will throw if you want to be in bed woman I will throw you in bed not the bed of your shameful immorality but the bed of sickness.
[time=2714] And I believe what this leads to and means as we would study other passages in scripture the bed of sickness would lead her to her death and for her the hells of the flames of hell.
[time=2726] I'm going to kill her I'm going to take her out and I'll do it through a bed a bed of sickness even as it was the bed that she laid in with her immorality.
[time=2737] And he goes on verse 22 not just Jezebel but those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation these would be both the unbelievers and the believers the bonds servants who were caught up in her false doctrine and followed her into immorality.
[time=2752] He says I'm going to bring great tribulation on them speaking of the believers I'm going to bring incredible chastisement upon their head.
[time=2760] Hebrews chapter 12 the evidence that were really sons of God and born of God is that God faithfully disciplines us when we fall into sin that's what he's going to do.
[time=2768] I'm going to bring great tribulation down upon their heads unless they repent of their deeds now verse 23 and I will kill her children with pestilence.
[time=2777] Who are her children her natural children that's unlikely are they children because they follow her know he's already addressed with those I believe the children here in verse 23 are the second generation false prophets and prophetesses they will get the same thing she gets death.
[time=2793] I will kill her children I will kill the second generation of false prophets inside this church with pestilence I'll wipe them out.
[time=2803] You say to yourself is there any room for me as a believer living here 1992 in Fort Wayne in order to do the noble things provide for my family support this church maintain the reputation of Christ is there any room for me.
[time=2821] While hanging clinging to the doctrines that I love and believe in even growing in them verse 19 staying zealous in my faith my love my service my perseverance with that in my heart is there any room for me to acknowledge that there would be another God and another way of salvation answer no.
[time=2842] Resolve it forever in your mind that is not a compromise God is allowing us to make.
[time=2851] You say oh but in my heart I would know who the true God is and I'm not the announcing Christ I understand God is a jealous God.
[time=2858] God will not share his glory with another God will not allow us to say there may be another God there may be another way of salvation.
[time=2869] The lot of those who do those who purported and teach it is death and those who follow along in it incredible jazz tisement and discipline.
[time=2879] Now this would have been an incredible shock to this church.
[time=2883] I mean this would have hit them like a ton of bricks now imagine it's Sunday morning in Thyatira and you've gotten wind that the messengers are making their way from Ephesus to Smirna on down to Pergamum and now it's our Sunday we've come with great anticipation to hear what the Lord would say to us.
[time=2898] And this thing opens up the son of God who has eyes like a flame of fire in his feet are like burnish bronze and already you're taking notice and getting very nervous.
[time=2908] And then you hear this commendation and you think well that is us we are increasing we are full of love and faith in service.
[time=2914] But then he opens both barrels on what had taken the church at large by storm this accommodating theology.
[time=2923] And so there would have been believers in there who didn't do that stuff who didn't accept other gods and weren't involved in the idolatrous worship and it's those he seeks to encourage in verse 24.
[time=2934] The people who might be trembling in their boots saying how broad a brush is his judgment painting with I mean am I going to get swept up in this great judgment even though I didn't do anything.
[time=2944] Verse 24 but I say to you the rest who are in Fiat Ira who do not hold this teaching and have not known the deep things of Satan as they call them I place no burden on you.
[time=2957] In other words he's assuring them that his judgment will be specific it will fall only on those who have compromised their faith.
[time=2965] It will fall only on those who have said there may be in another God there may be another way.
[time=2971] It will not touch those who have been faithful to stand true for Christ.
[time=2979] Well the correspondent is Christ the city Thayatira the church probably begun by Lydia strengthened by the ministry of Paul the commendation you're increasing in your works you're getting better at the things of your Christianity but.
[time=2995] The condemnation there is judgment on you for you have acknowledged and worshiped another God.
[time=3005] Let's look at number six the command.
[time=3008] Verse 25.
[time=3010] He says nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come of course he's speaking to those who have not been in the deep things of Satan he's speaking to his faithful contingent there.
[time=3023] And he's saying hold on and the Greek word describes absolute you know terror hold on for all your worth as if to let go you'd fall into the abyss hold on with all your might.
[time=3035] And that would have been difficult for them to do they were being persecuted in the workplace because they wouldn't get involved in these guardian gods of the guilds.
[time=3044] They were coming to their church where they should have been encouraged and strengthened for their stand and really lifted up but instead the church had gone a wall and had compromised their faith and so there's no strength there so they're all alone.
[time=3058] And Christ is hanging on until I come in other words not that I would come tomorrow I mean we know from history this church was gone within a hundred years of this writing they apparently did not repent and Christ came and wiped them out.
[time=3071] So the I come here is the I come of the assurance that I know your situation I understand your situation and I will eventually deal with these people and I will judge them and I will vindicate you you hold on until I come even though you may die long before I do which is the same promise he gives to us.
[time=3090] So the command nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come and then he closes this whole chapter out versus 26 and following with the council and this is where he pleads for obedience.
[time=3104] He says and he who overcomes in verse 26 the overcomer of course is the believer because all believers overcome first John 5 and he who keeps my deeds until the end to him I will give authority over the nations.
[time=3121] And he shall rule them with a rod of iron that's a reference back to Psalm 2 verses 7 8 and 9 that's Christ pictured in his millennial kingdom and what he is saying here to these believers is as you are faithful and as you overcome to him I will give authority over the nations I will make you a code disciplinarian with this rod of iron in the millennial kingdom you will be a coach shepherd along with me you will have splendor and glory and majesty as you have privilege of raining with me in the millennial kingdom for a thousand years.
[time=3150] A literal reign of Christ on this earth.
[time=3154] Tremendous incentive.
[time=3157] In the number of 2080 ads and I will give him the morning star you say what in the world is that I believe that's a reference to Christ himself.
[time=3166] Revelation 22 16 says I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things for the churches I am the root and the offspring of David the bright and morning star.
[time=3179] Jesus says I'll give you myself I'll not only give you part of my rule and reign in the millennial kingdom but you'll have me.
[time=3189] And then he says as he often does he who has an ear verse 29 let him hear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches.
[time=3200] This is all listen listen carefully listen trust me and obey.
[time=3212] I don't know will that happen in America wouldn't surprise me to be honest with you it wouldn't surprise me.
[time=3222] Forever in your heart this morning based on this text resolve in your heart that though they would let you stay in this church.
[time=3235] And by staying in this church we could even increase in our love and our faith and our perseverance and our service.
[time=3245] All they're asking of you all they want is for you not to be so narrow minded and acknowledge or or recant from this notion that there is salvation in only one name.
[time=3263] The name of Jesus Christ it may be the most subtle form of attack upon the Christian because he can still hold on to the bare essentials of his faith and seem just to be reasonable to the unredeemed.
[time=3280] And God in no uncertain term says absolutely not I will share my glory with no other I am a jealous God you will worship me and acknowledge me and me alone.
[time=3296] It's a tough standard but it's one worth dying for Amen let's pray together.
[time=3310] Father thank you for this attribute of yours that we understand through this letter.
[time=3317] You like a jealous husband the husband of the Old Testament would be grieved in your heart when Israel would play the harlot.
[time=3326] And the picture of the New Testament is of Christ with the bride and we are the bride we are the church.
[time=3334] There is something wonderful in those pictures it means that this is more than just religion this is relationship this is real life stuff that we're dealing with you love us.
[time=3345] And you look to our hearts to the purity of our hearts to worship you and you alone.
[time=3351] And Father I'm thankful we don't live in a day where that is put to the test in this extreme way but as we have opportunity to identify ourselves with you in the marketplace in ways that are appropriate not
[time=3365] rash and rude cramming Christ down people's throats but in sensitive ways help us not to be ashamed of that give us and help us to look for opportunities to do that in meaningful ways to exalt the Savior.
[time=3379] And should it come to the place where we either profess you and you alone or lose our jobs may a time such as this come back to our minds where the clear teaching of the word of God is indisputable.
[time=3393] And we have no other option and we are buttressed by the truth in that moment of need where we would stand strong for the cause of Christ and be purified even as the church at Smyrna was.
[time=3405] Well thank you in Jesus name. Amen.
