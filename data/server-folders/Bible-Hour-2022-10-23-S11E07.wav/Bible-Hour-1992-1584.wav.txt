[time=0] >>Every pastor who has preached through the book of Revelation, I believe, has probably
[time=7] hoped that his church would be much like the church at Philadelphia.
[time=14] >>Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we
[time=28] hope you will find of being encouragement.
[time=31] Thank you for joining us.
[time=32] If Christ were to share with you his evaluation of your church, what would you expect him to say?
[time=38] Would your church escape rebuke and correction?
[time=40] Today we come in our study of Revelation to the church at Philadelphia, remarkably Christ finds no fault in them.
[time=47] He brings words of praise, promise, and blessing to this wonderful church.
[time=52] Stay with us as we learn about a church that delighted the heart of God.
[time=57] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation.
[time=61] We will be looking at chapter 3 verses 7 through 13.
[time=66] Our special music today will feature the piano artistry of Scott Schindler, a solo
[time=72] by Lisa Feney, and a solo from Jenny Clancy.
[time=96] [MUSIC - 960 seconds]
[time=1060] Thank you, Jenny. Jenny has been a part of our church.
[time=1064] She went to our Christian school.
[time=1066] She graduated from our high school.
[time=1068] And now serving in a wonderful ministry of music and church enrichment and encouragement.
[time=1072] And we're thankful for you, Jenny, and for your ministry.
[time=1076] Well, last Sunday, we pretty much devoted our time to the Christ of Christmas.
[time=1080] We looked at a Christmas message from Isaiah 55.
[time=1084] Seeing God as a persuasive salesman, encouraging people to receive the marvelous gift that He has provided in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1094] This morning we'll return back to our continuing study of the book of Revelation.
[time=1098] And if you'd like to take your Bibles and turn to Revelation 3, we're in a study of the seven churches of Revelation 2 and 3.
[time=1108] These are seven historical churches.
[time=1110] And the one we come to this morning, in a sense we don't really leave the Christmas theme at all.
[time=1116] Christ came to seek and say that which was lost, Christ came to save His people from their sins.
[time=1122] And this church, better than any of the other seven churches, is doing that.
[time=1126] This church, while Christ has ascended into heaven, is taking the very purpose and the meaning of Christmas and bringing it to the people of the city in which God has located it.
[time=1136] This is a marvelously positive message about a positive church.
[time=1140] Unlike the other churches which typically have a note of rebuke from our Lord where the Lord will condemn them for something.
[time=1146] He'll say some commending words and then you'll find a transition with the word but and He'll go on to list the ways they've failed to really measure up.
[time=1154] You'll not find that in this church, the church at Philadelphia.
[time=1158] There is no condemnation, there is no rebuke, there is no warning, there is no change, there is no change.
[time=1164] There is no call for repentance, there is no calling them to remember former deeds and return to the way they used to be.
[time=1173] This church stands out, in fact it's only this one and the church at Smirna that are void of any type of rebuke from our Lord.
[time=1181] And you remember the church at Smirna was pure and godly and chaste because of incredible persecution.
[time=1188] The church at Smirna didn't receive a condemnation because they were under tribulation, their property and their poverty was extreme and they were being blasphemed by the Jews and they were thrown into prison and they were put even to death.
[time=1202] And it was that enormous external pressure that was being placed on this church that produced its purity and its holiness so that when Christ looked at it he had nothing negative to say.
[time=1212] When you come to Philadelphia there is no such external pressure, there is no persecution, that is not the cause for their godliness.
[time=1221] Something inside of them is right with God, something at the level of their heart has turned itself to seek the face of Christ and they are consistently doing that and as such when Christ scrutinizes them he finds nothing.
[time=1236] Now don't mistake this with a perfect church, there is no such thing as a perfect church, it's often been said if you find a perfect church don't go there, you'll ruin it.
[time=1247] In other words it won't be perfect anymore once you show up.
[time=1250] The church is full of imperfect people, the church is probably best described in that note or along that line of thinking as a hospital full of sick people.
[time=1260] That's what we are, we're saved by grace, we're eternally secure but we're a bunch of sick people in this hospital of a church as we minister one to another, we help each other, we minister to each other.
[time=1273] So this is not a perfect church, this is not a sinless church but as good as churches get and as strong as they can become that's what Philadelphia is.
[time=1284] Philadelphia is strong enough to avoid any type of reprimand or rebuke from the Lord and I imagine that every pastor who has ever taught his way through the book of Revelation when he comes to this church has in his heart the hope and the desire that his church would be this church, that he could preach through this series of verses and list off its virtues and describe the promises which God is going to give to this church.
[time=1313] At the end say, "See, that's us." And I would certainly hope that that would be true of us.
[time=1320] Notice in verse 8, there's a phrase that this church is famous for, chapter 3 verse 8, "I know your deeds behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut."
[time=1332] Some churches will even take their name from that phrase, they're called the church of the open door. When I was still in high school my sister Susie went off to the University of Southern California, she and her husband and by her own admission while she had prayed to receive Christ as a little girl.
[time=1349] The Lord didn't mean a lot to her through her high school years and her early college years, she was struggling and really waning in her growth and maturity.
[time=1358] And when she showed up in LA, there was an inner church there called COD, Church of the Open Door.
[time=1364] And there were some people who came from that church and ministered through campus crusade for Christ and that was the point of intersection between Susie, her husband, Tom, and a real rekindling of faith and life and exuberance for the things of Christ.
[time=1378] They drew her back into the church of the open door and there she learned from the word of God through a strong pulpit ministry and they were aggressive and evangelism and though primarily Caucasian there was a great representation of black people in the church and Hispanic people in the church and Asian people in the church, they were really broadly embracing the city that God had given them to minister to.
[time=1402] And it was through that church that she and later even impacted my life very positively for the things of Christ.
[time=1409] So the church of the open door, not just the one in Philadelphia, but the one in Los Angeles has a real place in my heart and as I studied through this passage this week and prepared to preach on it to you folks, I was reminded of that other church in Los Angeles and how powerful and how effective a church can be.
[time=1428] It's amazing how God uses the church. Christ came to save people from their sins, they rejected him, they crucified him after his ascension, he sent the spirit of God.
[time=1439] And for the first time in history, there came into existence the living church, the body of Christ and how suited it is to minister to families as a church should to help fortify and establish family values and strengthen in the church what is being taught in the home.
[time=1457] How a church can adapt and meet the needs of single people who are in some sense alone without the strength of a family network, but they find that in a church and they find the strength and the encouragement to penetrate the marketplace for the cause of Christ.
[time=1471] How a church can span the spectrum and reach to the older people in our family, those who have gone before us, those to whom we owe this great debt for the church we enjoy even today, and the way that we can put our arms around them and they around us.
[time=1485] The church is the most powerful organization and organism really known to man to meet such a total diversity of needs when it is doing what Christ wants it to do it cannot be stopped and it can do things that no organization can possibly hope to do.
[time=1503] And we're going to look at one of the best churches in the world this morning. And I would challenge you as you study this passage with you this morning to look and see are these qualities mine and increasing is this our church what would we do as a church to be more like this one.
[time=1520] It's unlikely that at this point in our stage we would compare with Smirna that would be a church in China or a church in Russia one that has undergone incredible persecution they would be in there as they would study that in that country they would be thinking this is us.
[time=1535] But of all the churches that don't have persecution filidelfea would be black hawk filidelfea would be the one we would compare ourselves to and pattern ourselves after and say is this us.
[time=1545] And so let's do that and we'll do that this morning following our traditional little outline here of seven points and it begins with the correspondent who wrote the letter.
[time=1555] As we've studied these letters it's obvious that Christ does not choose to identify himself by his name he doesn't say this letter comes to you from Jesus Christ the son of the living God.
[time=1566] Instead he gives character qualities about himself dimensions of his ministry and his person that are suited to the situation of the church he writes.
[time=1577] Looking verse seven into the angel of the church in filidelfea right he who is holy who is true who has the key of David who opens and no one will shut and who shuts and no one opens says this.
[time=1591] If you've been with us through our study that should sound a little different to you.
[time=1596] In all the previous letters he's drawn his description of himself from the vision in chapter one.
[time=1603] None of that comes from the vision in chapter one. None of those phrases are found in the vision in chapter one.
[time=1609] This all comes from the Old Testament. This is a very Hebrew introduction of himself.
[time=1614] He is introducing himself to these people and you can notice in verse nine he's dealing there with the synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews.
[time=1621] For some reason there's a heavy Jewish influence and so he draws upon Old Testament pictures to introduce himself.
[time=1627] There are four elements to it. I am holy. He says I am the holy one and in fact that is a famous term for God in the Old Testament.
[time=1637] Isaiah six holy holy holy the song of the seraphim. The only attribute of God which is repeated three times in a row holy holy holy.
[time=1645] Over and over again in the Old Testament God the father is referred to as the holy one. Isaiah 40, 25. Isaiah 43, 15. Psalm 16, 10. The list could go on.
[time=1655] So Christ is saying I am God. I am God in full deity. There is nothing mitigated about what my deity holds.
[time=1663] He claims the very term of God the father in the Old Testament for himself and rightfully so.
[time=1668] He adds to that I am also true. Secondly I am true. I am genuine. I am authentic which all they say is often translated.
[time=1679] And often the holy and the true come together. They are together in describing God as holy and true. Revelation 153 for example.
[time=1688] But he moves past holy and true to this interesting little phrase who has the key of David. Distinctly Jewish, distinctly Old Testament I have the key of David.
[time=1699] You say what is the key of David? The key of David is a phrase that comes out of Isaiah chapter 22 verse 22.
[time=1706] And this is a literal key and it is given to a man by the name of Eliakim because Eliakim has been given responsibility for the royal treasury of the nation of Israel.
[time=1719] He is the treasurer and he holds in his hand the key to the treasury. It is a symbol of authority and control.
[time=1728] Eliakim had the control to open it and to close it. And God said about him I will set him as a peg in a firm place to describe permanence and authority.
[time=1738] Eliakim had remarkable authority over the treasury of the nation of Israel to either open the door and let treasury out or to shut it and to dry up the blessings that would come from the treasury to the people of Israel.
[time=1752] Christ of course here is not talking about earthly treasures. When he says that I am the one that has the key of David he is saying I hold the key to divine treasure.
[time=1762] I am the one who opens the door of salvation. I am the one who opens the gates that enter into the kingdom of the heaven of God.
[time=1769] I am the one who opens doors of ministry. I am the sovereign one who opens and closes the door of blessing in people's lives and in church's lives.
[time=1781] And notice it is even strengthened in verse 7 who opens and no one will shut. In other words once Christ opens the door nobody else shuts it. He is totally sovereign and he who shuts no one opens. So his word is final.
[time=1795] And he begins by hinting at the good things that he would bestow upon the church of Philadelphia because they have been so godly.
[time=1804] He says I have in store for you enormous blessings and so I'll describe myself at the beginning of this letter as the one who holds the key to the storehouse of divine blessing.
[time=1814] And I will open and close it sovereignly and as you'll see he chooses to open it for this church.
[time=1821] And we are reminiscent of words of our Lord when he says no one comes to the Father but by me. I am the way. I am the door. These are all phrases which also describe Christ as the one through whom the blessings come.
[time=1838] And what a contrast. In the other letters to churches that are struggling and not doing as they ought he describes himself as the one with a two-edged sword and he envisions himself coming in judgment or he shows himself as the one with bronze feet so he can tread judgment upon them.
[time=1854] He sees himself as the one with the eyes of flaming fire, the piercing, penetrating vision past the thin veneer of spirituality to see the real condition of that church and then bring discipline upon it.
[time=1867] Not here. None of those phrases. None of that kind of impending doom or warning has come. Just I am the one. I'm the one. I've got the good. You're now in touch with the guy that controls all the blessings.
[time=1881] Secondly, then, we learn about the city and there is little to be said about Philadelphia. It was founded by a man named Atalus, ATT-AL-US, in 189 BC.
[time=1896] And he happened to have a very strong love for his brother, his physical brother. And so there are myths all about what he did for his brother.
[time=1905] I don't know if any of them are true, but it seems to be that he had a strong love for his brother so they nicknamed him Philadelphia. And because he founded the city, that nickname stuck with the city itself and so it became known as the city of Philadelphia.
[time=1918] It was noted for enormous or frequent volcanic activity. There were volcanoes in the area. They kept spewing over. Apparently they'd learned to manage the damage of those and benefit from the fertile soil that left behind.
[time=1932] And they also were subject to great earthquakes. In fact, in AD-17, Philadelphia was destroyed overnight by a huge earthquake. It also, by the way, destroyed 12 other cities. The only other of the seven worstedding was Sardis.
[time=1947] We moved into the church, number three. And again, nothing about the church except that we assume it began from the Paul, the ministry of the Apostle Paul in Acts chapter 19 through his preaching which went throughout all Asia.
[time=1961] Next, number four. The condemnation. There is none. I've already told you that. There's nothing to study. There's nothing to say. There is no condemnation. There is no warning. There is no rebuke. Just blessed silence. And so he, as will we, moves directly to his commendation.
[time=1979] And this is where it gets good. Look at this. Verse eight. Let me tell you what I like about you guys. I know your deeds. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut because you have a little power and have kept my word and have not denied my name.
[time=1998] Number nine or verse nine. Behold, I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not but lie. Behold, I will make them to come and bow down at your feet. And to know that I have loved you. Verse 10.
[time=2013] Because you have kept the word of my perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing that hour which is about to come upon the whole world to test those who dwell upon the earth.
[time=2024] He lists off several wonderful descriptive terms about this church, things that he likes, things that he wants to commend them for. And the first is right there in verse eight. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut because you have a little power.
[time=2043] You are a dynamite church. The power of the Spirit of God is flowing in and through you, things that are really peculiar to the ministry of the Spirit of God, the power of Christ is evidenced in your church.
[time=2061] He says it's a little power. In other words, you're not the biggest church in the world and you're not going to change the whole world yourselves. But for what you are, for your size, you are powerful.
[time=2072] It really means by that they were few in number that they came from a poor class of citizenry in Philadelphia. They were just the common citizens, the lower class, the poor folks. They didn't have everything they needed. They didn't have a lot of stuff. But given what they had, they had power.
[time=2088] Reminds us of 2 Corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 where it says, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness." This church had learned that lesson to rest and to be dependent upon the power of the Spirit of God and it was flowing through their church.
[time=2105] You see, what was it doing? What does that kind of power accomplish? Does that mean that they were really well networked with the political structure of the city of Philadelphia and they could pull all kinds of strings behind the scenes to get things to go they wanted them to go.
[time=2117] No, that's not the kind of power. The church is never called to a political agenda. The church is called to a spiritual agenda. The power they were experiencing is they were seeing people come to Christ and they were seeing those people growing and maturing.
[time=2133] They were seeing bad habits change. They were seeing thought processes reversed to come in line with the word of God. They would have been seeing strong, healthy families grown up.
[time=2143] That's the kind of power. People were coming to Christ and being discipled and matured in the things of God. They were powerful at that. That was happening in their church.
[time=2152] Secondly, he commends them for their obedience. Look again at verse 8 because you have a little power and have kept my word. This church was bound to the Scriptures.
[time=2164] They were absolutely loyal and committed to obeying the word of God somehow and it sounds so simple. You say, "Man, this is the list of the greatest church in AD 90."
[time=2176] Yeah, but that's so simple. Obey the word of God. You're right.
[time=2181] What we're trying to do with our kids across the street this morning teaching them to very simply obey Jesus is what has made this church so commendable.
[time=2191] They are a congregation that hears the preaching of the word of God and applies it to its life. It obeys it.
[time=2199] It studies it on its own. It obeys the word of God. John 14, 23, "If anyone loves me, what? He will keep my word."
[time=2207] John 15, 3, "You are my friends if you do what I command you." You say, "Man, that's so basic. You're right. That's all Christ requires."
[time=2218] Of us study the word of God and obey it. Commit your life to it.
[time=2224] Thirdly, he goes on to describe yet another attribute of this marvelous church and it's that of loyalty.
[time=2231] They have power, they're obedient, and they're loyal. Look at the end of verse 8. It says, "You have a little power and you've kept my word and have not denied my name."
[time=2246] You've not denied me. And again, this doesn't mean that they were put under a stake and said, "denied Jesus."
[time=2252] No, in this context, it would mean not to deny my name. His name is representative of all of his character, all of his attributes, all of his attitudes,
[time=2260] all that he stands for. And what he is saying is, "You, this little powerful obedient church have lived, commensurate with my character, my love, my faithfulness, my endurance. Everything that I am, you are. Everything that I want you to be to reflect the glory of Christ and to be Christ like."
[time=2278] That's what you guys do. You don't deny it in your words and in your actions. You live consistent with the character and the attitude and the attributes of Christ.
[time=2289] And then number four, and this is really just an extrapolation of that. Look at verse 10, "Because you have kept the word of my perseverance. They're a church of endurance. They're a church of endurance."
[time=2301] I like the way the NIV translate this better. It says in the NIV, "You have kept my command to endure patiently." That's really what he means.
[time=2311] He's saying, "I endured patiently. I endured the insults and the persecutions of men all the way to the end of my death. And I have commanded you to endure like I did. I want you to be like me, endure like I endure."
[time=2329] And apparently they were doing that. Nothing shows spiritual weakness faster and more clearly than when you find yourself in a difficult situation, whether it be family related or financially related or spiritually related.
[time=2348] And you want out. You've been underneath it too long in your mind, in your view. And what you want God to do is to relieve the pressure.
[time=2357] And God refuses to do that. God leaves you underneath the pressure. Nothing will reveal your godliness better than that. And if you are like Christ and if you are a mature, you'll stay under that trial without becoming angry, without becoming disillusioned in God, without demanding relief.
[time=2380] I see that in my life so often, I recognize a difficult situation that I don't like. And I know what God wants me to do. I know the attitudes and the dispositions that God would have for me in that setting. And I start out with good intentions and enjoy some measure of obedience.
[time=2399] But then it just stays too long. It just goes on for too long. And I finally get sick of it. And then I feel the anger inside of me.
[time=2409] And I'm mad at God. And I'm mad at whoever it is that's associated with it. And it just reveals the lack of growth. It just reveals the lack of maturity. And it stands as this flashing neon sign.
[time=2423] You need to mature how by being able to persevere as Christ persevered. You need to stay under trial. And I look at my life. I don't have a lot of trials. I mean, I wonder what it would be like if God were really hard on me.
[time=2439] And by the way, that's exactly the message of Job. God took away all the blessings out of Job's life. And Job said, "The Lord giveeth the Lord, takeeth away, bless the Lord."
[time=2449] He started with really good intentions. But God left him in that situation. And by 10 or 11 chapters later in the book of Job, Job has a clenched fist of anger and he's shaking it in the face of God saying, "God, you're out of your mind."
[time=2465] You know what we need here? We need a new God. We need a different God. We need an umpire. And I want to be in the courtroom with a third party. God's on that side of the room.
[time=2476] I'm on this side of the room. I'm a plead my case because I know I'm right. So he goes from being revealed as this righteous, godly man. But when God puts him under pressure a little while, it reveals the lack of maturity.
[time=2488] He doesn't want to submit. He doesn't want to endure. He wants his life the way he wants it.
[time=2496] Where's your breaking point? Are you aware of it? Do you see what happens? The dynamic that goes on in your life.
[time=2503] It's an avenue to tremendous confession of sin and growth.
[time=2509] This church had no doubt had bad times. It had bad trials and difficulties. But they had stayed with Christ. They had endured. They had persevered underneath that.
[time=2523] So he commends them marvelously and wonderfully. They are a church of power. They are a church of obedience. They are a church of loyalty. And they are a church of endurance. These are the hallmarks. These would be the pattern. This would be the template that we should follow and want to emulate.
[time=2540] And because of that, look now at what he promises them. Look at these three marvelous blessings that he wants to bestow upon them. Still a while they are on earth. Look at verse 8.
[time=2549] "I know your deeds. Behold, I have put before you an open door which no one can shut." What is that? What door is he talking about?
[time=2559] Well, if you study the New Testament, you'll find that the door always refers to the opportunity for ministry. It's the opportunity to be effective and successful in ministry.
[time=2570] First Corinthians 169 says this, "A wide door of effective service has opened to me." Talking about the ability to minister his gifts. Second Corinthians 212, "When I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me, I had no rest." In other words, God opened so many opportunities for ministry, so many doors opened up that I didn't have any time to rest.
[time=2594] And then Colossians 4 too. I love this verse. "Devote yourselves to prayer. Keep alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving, praying at the same time for us as well that God may open to us a door for the Word." So we may speak it.
[time=2612] He's calling the people of Colossi to get together for prayer meetings on a regular basis and ask that God would open doors of ministry to the people in their city and the people that he's ministering to as he travels in Asia Minor.
[time=2628] Man, you want to pray. You want to pray effectively. Pray that God would open doors of opportunity for the gospel in your life and in the life of this church. But Christ here, the one who holds the key of David says, "I've already opened it. I've opened for you an enormous door of ministry." Which is so exciting.
[time=2646] Look at the second promise. This is also amazing. Verse 9, "Behold, like wake up. Look at this. Pay attention to this one. I will cause those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie. Time out. What's that? The synagogue of Satan is Christ's term for this Jewish synagogue."
[time=2670] So on 74/8 they were called the synagogue of God. But because they had rejected the Messiah and turned their back on the provision of the Messiah, they were now by Christ called the synagogue of Satan.
[time=2680] And that's not being, you know, prejudiced against Jews. That's just telling the truth. You guys think you're worshiping God. You're not. You've rejected the true in the living God and the person of Christ. So the only person left for you to be worshiping is Satan. You are now a synagogue of Satan.
[time=2696] And you say you're true Jews, but you're not. You're liars. You say, "What is that? Either you're a Jew or you're not a Jew." I mean, isn't that it? Either you're Italian or you're not Italian.
[time=2706] Well, that's not the way it works with the Jews. Let me read you Romans chapter 2 verse 28. Listen. For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly.
[time=2717] Neither is circumcision. That which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly. And circumcision is that which is of the heart by the spirit, not by the letter.
[time=2730] Yes, you can be Jewish in that you're Israeli. You come from the nation of Israel. That is your lineage. That is your genealogy.
[time=2737] But in order to be a true Jew according to the word of God, it requires embracing Christ and faith whereby you are circumcised, not of the flesh, but of the heart. That's a true Jew.
[time=2749] There were obviously people in the city of Philadelphia who were Jews. They were meeting in a synagogue and they were opposing this church.
[time=2756] And they were saying that we are the ones who really know God.
[time=2760] We are the ones who will be opened and allowed to enter into the door of the millennial kingdom. We're the true ones. You guys are the fakes. You Christians. You guys are the fakes.
[time=2773] Look at it at the end of verse 9. Behold, I will make them to come and bow down at your feet. It's a know that I have loved you. In other words,
[time=2785] this church is going to have the privilege of leading Jews to Christ. They're going to come to true saving faith through the ministry of the church at Philadelphia.
[time=2795] You know who the hardest person in the world to evangelize is? A Jew. They're impossible.
[time=2803] Not only are they blinded by the God of this age, but God has taken the nation of Israel and set it on a shelf so that the church can do the ministry that it was originally given to the nation of Israel.
[time=2813] Now, of course, God will redeem His covenant with them in the millennial kingdom. But He has literally taken them and set them over here.
[time=2822] When you try to talk to a Jew about the Messiah that it's not He's coming, He's already come. He's Christ. And you need to repent and come to faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2833] They begin to, you know, they get goosebumps. They get so angry. They grate their teeth. They're flaming angry at you.
[time=2840] That's all a part of the sovereign plan of God for them. But at times, throughout history, God has redeemed great numbers of Jewish people out of that blindedness into the faith, into the church.
[time=2853] And this is one of those times. He's saying, "I'm going to give you the enormous privilege of leading Jews to Christ."
[time=2859] And if you've ever been around a converted Jew, someone who has recognized that Christ is indeed the Messiah and has bowed the knee before Christ,
[time=2867] you've experienced joy and a fullness of understanding inside the heart of mind of that Jew that is just unspeakable joy. It's wonderful.
[time=2878] Blessing number three. Look at what else He wants to give them. Verse 10, "Because you've been faithful, because you have kept the word of my perseverance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing that hour which is about to come upon the whole world to test those who dwell upon the earth."
[time=2898] This may be a testing that came in that period of history, but it's unlikely because we know of none that went across the whole known world.
[time=2908] When it says the whole world that is undoubtedly a reference to the tribulation, what's described in the rest of the book of Revelation, he's saying, "I'm going to take you out of the tribulation."
[time=2917] We call it a pre-trib rapture. This is one of the first hints and discussions of a pre-trib rapture of the book of Revelation. What he's saying is the holocaust that's coming upon the end of the age, I'm going to take you out of that.
[time=2929] And of course, he promises that to this church and in the other faithful church.
[time=2934] So Marvelous Blessings, I'll give you an open door of successful ministry in that I'll allow you to lead Jews to Christ, the very chosen people of God, and I'll also spare you from the end of the age, the great tribulation.
[time=2948] Then number six, the command, verse 11. He says, "I'm coming quickly, hold fast what you have in order that no one take your crown."
[time=2958] He's so sympathetic. He knows the difficulty of their circumstance. He knows how hard it is to persevere. And so he says, "Hang on. Hang on with all your worth to what you have."
[time=2971] The little phrase in order that no one take your crown. That's the crown of life.
[time=2977] So translated in other portions of Scripture, James 1, 12, Revelation 2, 10, that's talking about eternal life. Stay faithful to the end, prove yourself to be a true believer in the person of Christ.
[time=2990] Then number seven, as we close the council. And if you thought you were encouraged by the three promises, he was going to give them well on earth, listen to the four promises, he offers them when they finally get to heaven.
[time=3000] Verse 12, "He who overcomes, I will make him number one, a pillar in the temple of my God." He says, "What's a, what do you mean, a temple?"
[time=3009] Well, temples in the pillars and these temples were ornately decorated. They were carved, and then they were studied with jewels.
[time=3016] And he's saying, "I'm going to make you an object of wonder and glory and praise in the eternal dwelling place. You will be contributing to the splendor of heaven."
[time=3026] He may also have meant the stability that comes with a pillar. You hear about the pillar of the assembly. It is that which holds the place up. It's not going in, it's not going out, it's got permanent residents inside the temple of the living God.
[time=3040] So he is saying, "You will be that which ornately decorates all that is ours. You will be a sign of security and safety and glory in the coming kingdom."
[time=3050] You'll be part of it. Then number two, verse 12, "And he will go out from it any more, and I will write upon him the name of my God."
[time=3059] He's going to write on us, Elohim, or Yahweh. He said, "Well, so what's the deal? Have you ever dropped your kids off of the nursery?"
[time=3071] What do you do? I mean, there's 25 little kids in there. You want to make sure you get the right one back, right?
[time=3077] So you go, "You write Whitney Moore on a piece of tape and then you stick it on her." And what you're saying is she's mine. Nobody takes her home but me. This is my possession. That's what he's saying.
[time=3090] "I'm going to write upon you the very name of God because you are His and no one else takes you but God. You are His, He loves you, you're His child, and He identifies Himself and His relationship with you by writing His name on your person."
[time=3105] Next, it says in verse 12, "I'll write upon them the name of my God and the name of the city of my God." The new Jerusalem. He's going to write Jerusalem on you, which is a sign of citizenship.
[time=3118] You'll have all the rights and prerogatives of membership. If you've ever been to a certain kind of club, a country club, or some very prestigious place, they don't let you in the door unless, and they don't give you the privileges of the club, unless you're a member of the club, unless you show the card.
[time=3134] I'm a member for members only. What he's saying is that's true of Jerusalem. Only the redeemed, only those who have confessed faith in Jesus Christ, have membership and citizenship in the city of Jerusalem. And I'm going to write it on you. They'll never be a question about that.
[time=3149] You'll come and go as you please in and around the city of Jerusalem and you'll enjoy all the heavenly privileges.
[time=3157] And then this last one I love, the end of verse 12, he says, "I'll write on you my new name." The Christian is going to get a new name. Remember, written on that white stone that only Christ knows.
[time=3170] But it's also true that Christ gets a new name. See, what is that? Well, nobody knows. Let me give it to you this way, though.
[time=3180] Right now, we know we know some things about Christ. We study the Bible, we look carefully, we know a vast amount about the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3190] When we see him in his glorified state, we will be glorified and we will see dimensions and aspects to the personhood of Christ that we could never understand apart from that very moment of being glorified in the presence of the glorified Christ.
[time=3205] And somehow his new name, which he will give to us, will be explanation of dimensions of the person of Christ that here to for, we've never understood.
[time=3214] We'll be able to worship him in ways, we've never been able to worship him before because we'll see him in ways we've never seen him before.
[time=3220] We'll understand parts of his character and his ministry and his life and his sacrifice that we've never grasped before.
[time=3227] And so what he is saying here is when I give you my new name, there'll be a level of relationship and fellowship that we've never enjoyed before this time.
[time=3237] You say, is there a reward for being a faithful church? Is there a cause to be faithful? You bet there is.
[time=3247] Verse 13, have an ear. Listen to me. Listen to me more closely than you listen to the things of the world. Listen to me more than the way you listen to your own flesh beckoning for gratification and to pull you down to the lowest level.
[time=3262] Rise up and stand for Christ and live for Christ. Why? Because if you do together, God opens for us a door of ministry.
[time=3274] We'll bring people to Christ, we'll be kept from the ultimate hour of testing and when we go to heaven he'll make us a pillar in the temple of the eternal dwelling.
[time=3283] He'll write upon us the very name of God. He'll grant us his own name and he'll even give to us citizenship in the city of Jerusalem.
[time=3295] It's inspiring isn't it? There's a reason to live a godly life. There's a reason to grow and endurance. There's a reason to patiently endure the hardships of life and even of ministry.
[time=3308] Christ loves the church, calls it his bride in Ephesians chapter 5 and he is going to deck her out with every imaginable joy and blessing that the heavens can hold.
[time=3322] And if you love Christ and you're faithful to him, you will be among those enjoying the marvelous privileges described in this letter. Let's pray together.
[time=3338] Well those are exciting promises that God is making to those who truly love him, to people who have confessed to him as Lord and are giving their lives to him on a daily basis.
[time=3363] The Lord Jesus Christ has promised unbelievable blessings in heaven for those who have confessed to him as Lord.
[time=3371] If you've never done that, if you don't have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and you'd like to do that to ensure that your life will culminate in the glories of heaven,
[time=3382] would you bow your head with me even this morning and let's pray together and I'll lead you in a prayer of accepting Christ as your Savior.
[time=3391] My gracious God and Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner, I know that I have violated your law, I have transgressed you and others, and for that I deserve death, spiritual death, for all eternity.
[time=3404] But you have described in the book of Revelation a joy of heaven and blessings that are beyond the wildest dreams of anyone who has ever lived.
[time=3414] There's joy and peace and blessing there and I desire that. I confess my sin and I accept the forgiveness through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3423] Thank you God for sending Christ to save me from my sins and die on the cross to give me forgiveness.
[time=3429] I accept that. I invite him into my heart and my life to serve him from this day forward.
[time=3435] I praise you for the forgiveness in Christ, in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=3441] If as a result of today's program you have decided to pray to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
