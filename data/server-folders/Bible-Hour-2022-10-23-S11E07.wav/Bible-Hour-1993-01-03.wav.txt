[time=0] And the further we went with the churches, the worse they became, until finally we came
[time=6] to come to this church, Laodicea, and they are the worst of all the churches.
[time=12] The church we're going to study this morning receives the most severe rebuke from our Lord.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=36] Thank you for joining us.
[time=38] Some churches make the Lord sad, others make the Lord angry, but the church at Laodicea makes him sick.
[time=45] What is it about this church that is so repulsive to the Lord?
[time=49] Stay with us this morning as we continue in our study of the book of Revelation.
[time=54] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation.
[time=59] We will be looking at chapter 3 verses 14 through 22.
[time=64] Our special music today will feature a solo by Lori Scheiman, and the Men Singers Quartet.
[time=78] Let's now join our service.
[time=93] This is my heart's cry, I want to know the one who saved me, and gave me life.
[time=110] This is my heart's cry, to be so close to him, that all my life becomes a testimony
[time=122] of my Savior's grace and love.
[time=129] This is my heart's cry, this is my heart's cry, much more than just a great desire.
[time=142] It's like a fire in me, I hear my heart cry.
[time=151] Each time I think about the cross where Jesus died, the cross should have been mine.
[time=160] But his love broke through time, and turned my heart's cry.
[time=169] He heard my heart's cry, now every other hope and dream is lost inside of this one thing.
[time=181] To know the one who died for me and lived my life, for Jesus Christ is my heart's cry.
[time=202] So let my life become a testimony of my Savior's grace and love.
[time=229] Oh, this is my heart's cry, to stand for the Father one day, until you save your time.
[time=246] This is my heart's cry.
[time=263] There was a day, unknown before a history.
[time=292] When God came down to dwell as man, as a helpless babe became the Lord of Heaven.
[time=308] O child, what love he must have had for you and for me.
[time=321] I came down to save a soul, and one day loved, nailed him on a cross to take my place.
[time=341] His name is love, love, love, love, His name is Jesus.
[time=355] That was the day, when God revealed himself to man, through Jesus Christ, His only son.
[time=370] What a perfect life he lived, what wisdom taught us, what most of all what love he had for you and for me.
[time=386] Love came down to save a soul, and one day loved, nailed him on a cross to take my place.
[time=410] His name is love, love, love, love.
[time=417] His name is Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=432] Well, we want to give a special greeting to all of you that are watching the Bible hour,
[time=452] and again wish you a very happy New Year.
[time=454] I hope that this is a prosperous year for you.
[time=457] You will continue watching the Bible hour and other avenues of spiritual inspiration that you have available to you.
[time=465] We are especially thankful for those of you that helped us in our year-end giving.
[time=470] Russell, there were just a great number of people that responded to our letter, and we're really appreciative because as you know, we don't ask for money very often, and we're really trying not to, but there is an expense in producing the Bible hour.
[time=485] That's right, and I think as a part of that, you're going to be receiving the living Christmas tree tape, and you're going to be thrilled with what you hear and receive there.
[time=493] It's going to give you many hours of enjoyable listening, but I too would just say thank you for the continued support and the ability that it gives us to continue to broadcast
[time=503] these messages and our services.
[time=505] I'm really thankful when we have special events that we do get to meet some of the people that watch the Bible hour regular, and perhaps attend other churches but are also supportive of our ministry, and we're grateful for that.
[time=517] Russell, you've been ministering with us for about quite some time now, and you're going
[time=524] back to where you formerly came from and have a chance to minister out in California.
[time=529] That's right.
[time=530] Next week I won't be on the Bible hour because I'll have been in California, I've been invited back by the Masters College, which is where I used to minister, and they're having a big Bible conference for the students canceling classes for three days and bringing in some
[time=545] speakers, and I'm one of those, so we'll have an opportunity to minister to the students and also meet with some other pastors that are friends of mine from around the country and kind of have like a personalized conference to discuss church matters and what's going on, and I'm looking forward to that, and I'd ask you to hold me in your prayers as I'm gone.
[time=562] I'd be thankful for that, of course.
[time=564] Well, we'll be praying for you, and we love Masters College and have a little piece of our heart there, so I'm sure that that'll be an interesting time for you and no doubt refreshing as you meet other pastors.
[time=577] I wanted to say to you that while Russell's gone next week that during the insert, we'll have our school administrator, Steve Longbrake, we'll bring you up to date on our new building.
[time=586] We're seeing, we're smelling paint very near to our own offices because they're painting walls and putting some of the final touches on the building, and we want to bring you up to date, so we'll have some video, and we'll talk to Steve a little bit about the upcoming opening of our new portion of our building.
[time=604] And then I want to remind you that we're making available again this month, the Daily Walk Bible Calendar.
[time=610] This is a calendar that you can put on your desk or on your counter that gives you a verse for the day.
[time=615] A thought about that verse, and then even a plan to help you read through the entire Bible.
[time=620] And I hope you'll write for the calendar, we'll just have a couple of weeks that we'll be offering this.
[time=624] You can receive it by simply writing to the Bible Hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne,
[time=630] Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=634] Once again, just write and ask for the calendar at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne,
[time=641] Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=646] And just before we go back to the live portion of our program, I want to remind you of another date.
[time=651] On January 15, at 730, we will have Michael English in concert here at the Blackhawk Baptist
[time=657] Church.
[time=658] This is a ticketed concert, and you can stop by at any of the local bookstores.
[time=662] They have tickets, or you can stop here at the church and purchase your tickets.
[time=667] This is going to be a very exciting, contemporary concert, and I hope that you will take advantage
[time=674] of the opportunity to come and be with us on that evening, January 15 at 7.30 pm.
[time=682] Going back now to the live portion of our service, I hope that you'll stay with us for more music and the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=695] Who can move the mountains that are hickering you today?
[time=708] Who can pick them up like pebbles, clear them from the way?
[time=715] Who can prove his power when our Christian heals to pray?
[time=721] It is Jesus, he's the one, he's the one.
[time=729] Jesus holds all power in his mighty hands divine.
[time=736] He's the one who healed the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=743] He makes all things possible, and he's a friend of mine.
[time=749] Blessed Jesus, he's the one, who can heal the heartache that is crushing you with thee?
[time=763] Who can pour the bone of heaven where the hurt has been?
[time=770] Who can chase the shadows, make the song of joy begin?
[time=776] It is Jesus, he's the one, he's the one.
[time=784] Jesus holds all power in his mighty hands divine.
[time=791] He's the one who healed the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=797] He makes all things possible, and he's a friend of mine.
[time=803] Blessed Jesus, he's the one, the only one.
[time=811] Who can give you from all harm and guide you by the hand?
[time=818] Who can give you power for service and the strength to stand?
[time=825] Who can give you grace for all that living made in man?
[time=831] It is Jesus, he's the one, the one.
[time=838] Jesus holds all power in his mighty hands divine.
[time=845] He's the one who healed the sick, turned water into wine.
[time=852] He makes all things possible, and he's a friend of mine.
[time=858] Blessed Jesus, he's the one.
[time=892] Thank you, men.
[time=893] Those are some fine men.
[time=894] I'm thankful for each one of them.
[time=896] Eric Holes is the director of our church orchestra, and Bob Veneta is just a faithful member of our church, he and his family, he sings in our choir, and as you know had a solo in our living Christmas tree, and then Ed Rickert is the man behind the scenes, he's on staff here at the church, and he's just marvelously gifted.
[time=913] He works behind the scenes with the Bible hour and all of our sound and all the technical things, so we're thankful for those guys.
[time=920] Would you take your Bibles with me this morning and open to Revelation chapter three?
[time=925] We're going to look at verses 14 to 22 this morning as we continue our study of this marvelous
[time=931] book of the Bible.
[time=933] If you're new with us this morning, it's important that you know that our practice at this church is to settle on a book of the Bible, typically the New Testament, and then to study that book in an expositional fashion, which means to examine it word by word, sentence by sentence,
[time=949] really verse by verse, chapter by chapter until we've covered that book and understand its flow and its theme, and we can be instructed then by the heart and mind of Christ as he reveals himself to us in this marvelous book.
[time=964] We're in a section in Revelation chapters two and three, and in this section Christ is assessing seven churches, seven historical literal churches that existed in Asia Minor
[time=976] about 90 A.D., and this morning we come to the last of those seven churches, the church at Laodicea, and it's a remarkable church for many reasons.
[time=986] There are two verses in this passage about this church that probably stand out in all the book of Revelation the 1st is in verse 16.
[time=996] So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.
[time=1002] That's kind of become an infamous statement in the word of God, and once you've heard it, you never seem to forget it.
[time=1006] Well, Christ said that about the church at Laodicea, the church will study this morning.
[time=1011] The second verse that isn't infamous, but really famous, is in verse 20.
[time=1016] There you read, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[time=1020] If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and will dine with him and he with me." And so that's the famous little verse that we all learn as children in a Sunday school classroom somewhere, and there's almost a picture in your mind's eye of Jesus standing at the door of someone's heart and knocking, asking for permission to come in.
[time=1041] Out of the seven churches that we have studied, two of them have gone without condemnation.
[time=1047] Two of them have been beyond reproach.
[time=1050] They are Smyrna and Philadelphia.
[time=1052] You remember Smyrna because of external persecution, and Philadelphia because of some internal commitment to follow Christ, both of these, being scrutinized by the Lord Himself, went without any type of condemnation.
[time=1065] The other five, however, were the brunt of some condemnation.
[time=1069] It seems almost as if they were placed in a descending order.
[time=1074] And the further you move in the progress of these seven churches, the worse they get.
[time=1080] And that would be true with Laodicea.
[time=1081] This is the worst of all seven churches, the worst even of the five, for a number of reasons.
[time=1087] Number one, as you look at this passage, you will not find a mention of a believer anywhere.
[time=1093] There isn't even a remnant of believers, a small contingent of people in the church at Laodicea who are mentioned here as believers.
[time=1101] It goes without any mention.
[time=1102] Sardis, you remember, was the dead church.
[time=1105] Chapter three, verse one.
[time=1106] He says, "I know your deeds that you have a name that you're alive, but you're really dead.
[time=1110] You're spiritually dead.
[time=1111] There's nothing alive in you." But verse four, he says, "But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white for they are worthy." There in Sardis, though dead, they at least had a remnant of true believers.
[time=1126] Apparently, that's not the case in Laodicea.
[time=1127] They're not anywhere mentioned.
[time=1129] Secondly, Laodicea has no commendation.
[time=1135] The Lord says nothing positive about this church.
[time=1138] Not one positive thing, not one redeeming feature.
[time=1142] They stand alone in that regard as having nothing positive to be said about them as the Lord scrutinizes them.
[time=1148] Thirdly, then as a result, the language of this passage is the most threatening of all of them.
[time=1154] It's a blistering rebuke, it's an unmitigated scathing denunciation of their church.
[time=1162] But Christ, as a master teacher, you're going to see Him in this passage, take the natural setting, the city in which they live, the events of their lives, and He's going to use this as a backdrop against which to communicate vital, necessary truth to them about their
[time=1179] problems, about his concerns with them.
[time=1182] And so He shines in this passage as a master teacher, a master communicator who composes
[time=1189] an insightful, relevant message to them, opening to open their eyes to their spiritual plight and to call them to repentance, to salvation, to be born again.
[time=1200] Let's begin in verse 14 following our familiar little outline with the correspondent.
[time=1205] Verse 14, "And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write this, 'The Amen, the faithful
[time=1212] and true witness the beginning of the creation of God,' says this.
[time=1217] He says three things about Himself, He says, 'I am the Amen, I am the faithful and true witness, and I am the beginning of the creation of God.' Now this does not come from the vision in chapter 1, as so many of the other introductions have come.
[time=1230] This also does not come from the Old Testament.
[time=1234] In order to understand this introduction of Christ, you need to hold your finger here in Revelation and come with me to the book of Colossians.
[time=1241] Romans chapter 4, "And here begins the Lord's insightful way of dealing with the church
[time=1247] at Laodicea." What you need to know is that Laodicea was part of a kind of a tri-city network.
[time=1257] There were three cities located within six or ten miles of each other.
[time=1262] Laodicea, Colossi, and a city called Herropolis.
[time=1266] All three of these cities were sister cities or tri-cities, and they were all located in the Lycus River Valley.
[time=1273] And these little churches were all struggling with the same stuff, the same doctrine, the
[time=1279] same spiritual issues.
[time=1281] And so what the Lord would say to one, He could say to the other, 'Look at Colossians 4, 16, you'll see this, Colossians 4, 16, and when this letter is read among you, namely
[time=1292] you Colossians, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans.
[time=1297] And you for your part read my letter that is coming from Laodicea.
[time=1302] Now we don't think there was actually a letter called the Laodicean letter.
[time=1307] We believe actually that was the book of Ephesus that had been passed to the Laodiceans and was then supposed to go on to Colossi.
[time=1314] But it's important to note that this letter, the Colossian letter, was not only irrelevant and important to the saints at Colossi, but also to the saints at Laodicea.
[time=1324] Which raises the question, well then what was the issue?
[time=1327] What was Colossians about?
[time=1329] Come to chapter 1 of Colossians.
[time=1333] The primary struggle in the church at Colossi and the church at Herropolis and the church at Laodicea was the deity of Christ of all things.
[time=1344] There were those that were teaching there that because Christ had become a human being in the manger, because He'd actually taken on the form of human flesh, He obviously couldn't be God.
[time=1354] Because God is infinite, God could never be bound by a human body.
[time=1359] And so they refused to hold in tension the truth that is very plainly taught in the word of God that Jesus Christ is in fact the true in the living God.
[time=1367] And that somehow the mystery of the incarnation, He became a baby boy, a baby Jesus and lived
[time=1374] as a human did.
[time=1376] They refused to accept that apparent dichotomy.
[time=1378] They refused to accept that tension and so they detracted from the deity of Christ.
[time=1384] So see this reflected in verses 15 and following Colossians 1.
[time=1388] It says there and He, namely Christ, is the image of the invisible God.
[time=1394] You see, God is invisible and when Christ became visible in the form of a human man, they thought, well, He couldn't really be God.
[time=1399] No, verse 15, He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
[time=1405] For by Him all things were created both in Heavens and on the earth, visible and invisible where the thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things have been created by Him and for Him.
[time=1417] And He is before all things and in Him all things hold together.
[time=1421] Now verse 18, He is also the head of the body of the church and He is the beginning.
[time=1428] That phrase, He is the beginning is the exact same Greek phrase that you have in Revelation 3, 14.
[time=1434] So you have got sister cities or Tri-Cities living together and they are struggling with
[time=1441] the same spiritual issues.
[time=1444] Now come back with me, Revelation chapter 3, the issue that the Laodiceans were concerned with was the deity of Christ and apparently while Colossae went on to struggle with the deity of Christ and eventually affirmed that Christ was in fact full God, Laodicea didn't,
[time=1461] Laodicea opted out for that and said no, He isn't really God and that may be exactly why they are in so much spiritual trouble.
[time=1469] In fact, that may be why there isn't even one believer mentioned in this entire letter because if you have a church that is articulating a different Jesus, a Jesus that is not the Jesus of Scripture and people put their faith in that different Jesus, then nobody's saved
[time=1485] even though they're all naming in some form the name of Christ.
[time=1493] So that is the issue and Christ sets them at the very beginning of this letter straight by clarifying that He is in fact God.
[time=1500] He begins by saying I am the amen and as you know, amen means so be it or it is fixed or
[time=1506] this is final, this is unchangeable, this is the last word on this subject, I'm it.
[time=1511] I am the last word on the subject of God, I am God.
[time=1516] He then says the faithful and true witness, I am a witness who can be believed, I am a witness who can be trusted, if I say it is true, if I say it's not true, it's not true, you can trust me, I am a faithful and a true witness and you say to yourself well what did he witness about, what did he give testimony to the fact of, well he bore witness that
[time=1536] he was God, all of the miracles that are recorded in the gospels show over and over and over again that he was God, his preaching claims that he was God, his whole life was one long
[time=1547] drawn out witness to the fact that God has taken the form of human flesh.
[time=1552] So I am the amen, I am the faithful and the true witness and in the clincher in this beginning little introduction is I am the beginning of creation of God.
[time=1561] Your NIV translation says I am the ruler which is a fair translation.
[time=1565] In other words, he's not saying I am the first thing that God ever created.
[time=1569] As you saw in Colossians, Christ is saying I am the source of creation, the reason anything
[time=1575] created whether visible or invisible, powers or dominions or thrones or authorities, whatever it is out there that God created I did it.
[time=1582] So make no mistake about it, I am not reduced to being a created being, I am in fact the
[time=1588] creator of all that is.
[time=1591] So he sets him straight, he begins by saying you've had a major problem in your understanding of me, get it straight from the beginning, I am God.
[time=1601] Secondly, we move to the city and there are three things I want you to know about this city.
[time=1607] The first is that they were rich, they were wealthy, they were fabulously endowed financially.
[time=1613] In fact, they were a financial banking center in Asia Minor.
[time=1618] The second thing is that they had a vibrant textile industry which added to their wealth and made them famous for the kinds of things that they could produce.
[time=1627] Thirdly, they were well known for a medical school that was about 13 miles outside the
[time=1634] city itself but it was their medical school.
[time=1636] Let me go back through those with a little more detail, why were they rich?
[time=1640] They were rich because located as they were in this Lycus River Valley, they were at the crossroads of two of the main imperial highways of Asia Minor.
[time=1651] There was a main road in Asia Minor running north to south and they were on that road.
[time=1656] There was another road running east to west or west to east and they were on that road too.
[time=1661] They were at the crossroads of these two major highways and so all the commerce and all the trade and all the transportation and all the travel and all the money that that generated went right through their city and they capitalized on it.
[time=1674] So they became incredibly wealthy.
[time=1676] Secondly, this textile industry increased and enhanced their wealth.
[time=1680] They had figured out how to make wool soft, softer than anybody else could make and they also learned how to treat it so it would become shiny and kind of a glossy black.
[time=1692] So they had a corner on the market of soft, shiny, black, much coveted, much desired wool and with that they would manufacture clothing, they would weave it into oriental rugs that became very desirable and they would also just export the stuff in its raw form.
[time=1708] So they were famous for their clothing, they were famous for their wool and that also added
[time=1714] to their wealth.
[time=1716] Now there's medical school.
[time=1717] These Laodicean physicians had developed an eyesab which had become very, very popular
[time=1723] and the reading that I had indicated that that ancient world, the dust would be a real
[time=1729] problem for people's eyes and it would weaken their eyesight and it would irritate their eyes and their eyes would become blurry and they couldn't see as well but these Laodicean physicians had come up with a solution for that.
[time=1740] It was something that they made that you'd rub in your eyes and on your eyes and it would cleanse them.
[time=1744] There were some who wrote that it even had real healing power to not just clean the eye but to heal it of certain diseases.
[time=1752] So they were famous for that and they were also becoming richer by the moment because that whole medical community generated tremendous funds.
[time=1760] History records that they were so rich that in AD 60, some 30 years prior to the writing of this letter they were devastated by an earthquake, absolutely just leveled and what would have been common at that time would have been to appeal to Rome for funds to rebuild their city.
[time=1776] But they were so rich they proudly said no we don't want the funds from Rome we'll build it on our own and they did and they rebuilt it larger and bigger and better and more beautifully than it had been before so it was a source of real pride for them.
[time=1790] In fact a Roman historian, a guy by the name of Tacitus, wrote this, "Leo de Sia arose
[time=1796] from the ruins by the strength of our own resources and with no help from us," meaning Rome.
[time=1805] As to the church, you say tell me about the church, that's the city, what about the church?
[time=1810] We believe that this church was founded by a friend and comrade of the Apostle Paul, a man by the name of Apaphris, who we think evangelized the entire Lycus Valley, these
[time=1821] three cities sitting in that little valley.
[time=1823] Why do we believe that?
[time=1824] Well Colossians 1-7 is speaking about the faith of the saints at Colosses, Colossae and it says just as you learned it from Apaphris.
[time=1833] So the assumption is quite logical that if he is the one that evangelized Colossae it must have been that he also evangelized Herropolis and Leo de Sia.
[time=1842] Fourthly, the commendation, I've already told you, there is none, there is nothing good
[time=1848] to say.
[time=1849] There is only later you'll see an invitation to come to Christ so that they can be saved from judgment and damnation, but as they stand at this moment there is nothing in the scrutinizing eyes of Christ that reveal anything worthy of praise or commendation.
[time=1863] As one man put it, "Leo de Sia must bear the grim distinction of being the only church of the seven about which Christ has nothing good to say." So we'll bypass that and go on to number five, the condemnation.
[time=1875] Look at verses 15 and 16.
[time=1878] This is fascinating.
[time=1879] He says, "I know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot.
[time=1887] I would that you were cold or hot, so because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold,
[time=1893] I will spit you out of my mouth." What's he talking about here?
[time=1899] Again, the master teacher is drawing upon common knowledge that would have filled the people of that city and that day.
[time=1907] "Leo de Sia had lousy water and everybody knew it.
[time=1911] Herropolis down the road had very hot water.
[time=1914] They had these sulfur springs that people would go and they would sit in them and there was a therapeutic dimension to these waters that would relax them and calm them and some would even say people could be healed by being in these medicinal relaxing therapeutic hot waters of Herropolis.
[time=1930] Colossae, on the other hand, was known for its cold water.
[time=1934] It had very icy, cold, chilly, cool spring water that was refreshing and it was known
[time=1940] for drinking water.
[time=1942] "Leo de Sia had neither.
[time=1944] They weren't hot and they weren't cold with their water.
[time=1946] They were lukewarm.
[time=1947] It was kind of a tepid, sickening, detestable water.
[time=1952] They had originally been fed by their own natural springs and that water was a decent quality but as the city continued to grow because of all of its prosperity there were too many people for the water provided by the natural springs and so they established an aqueduct system, a series of stones about three feet across that had been hollowed out placed in the end and they would literally aqueduct water into their city so they could meet the needs of their people.
[time=1976] The problem is the water that came through that system was dirty and it was foul.
[time=1982] One historian said this, "The water carried by those pipes was so choked with impurities that it dropped much of its load and flow.
[time=1990] The calcium carbonite eventually clogged the pipes.
[time=1993] The water was collected in a central water tower then distributed through the streets by those pipes that radiated from it." The water tower and sections of the terracotta pipes are still visible even today.
[time=2006] It is evident at least that the water it carried was bad for thick deposits of calcerus impurities can still be seen almost choking the surviving section of the pipes.
[time=2016] So their water was rancid.
[time=2017] It was horrible.
[time=2018] It was dirty.
[time=2019] It was impure.
[time=2020] It was foul.
[time=2021] It was lukewarm and it would calve the natural reaction to a visitor to pop it in your mouth and then want to spit it out.
[time=2027] It wasn't hot, relaxing, therapeutic like Herropolis.
[time=2030] It wasn't cool and refreshing and valuable as was the water at Colossi.
[time=2034] It was lukewarm.
[time=2036] Now obviously the Lord is not talking to them about their water.
[time=2040] He's using that as an illustration or a metaphor.
[time=2042] What he wants to talk to them about is how that relates to their spiritual condition.
[time=2048] What does it mean to be spiritually cold?
[time=2052] To be spiritually cold is to be openly antagonistic against Christ.
[time=2058] To be spiritually cold is just to reject Christ flat out.
[time=2061] To make no pretense of faith, to never show up at church, to have no regard for Christ, the things of God, the Word of God.
[time=2068] Religion is just refused as some type of a weak, emotional crutch for weak, emotional
[time=2074] people who can't understand and deal with life on their own.
[time=2077] It's the antagonist, it's the agnostic, it's the atheist, it's a flat out rejection of Christ.
[time=2082] That's to be cold spiritually.
[time=2085] To be hot spiritually is to be zealous for God.
[time=2089] To be in genuine relationship with God, to love Him, to be zealous for the things of Christ, to belong for the pure milk of the Word, to seek after the things of God.
[time=2098] That's to be hot.
[time=2099] What Christ is saying is be one or the other, either be cold spiritually or be hot spiritually,
[time=2105] but don't find the sickening ground of lukewarm on the in-between.
[time=2111] Why?
[time=2112] Because if you're lukewarm, you've made an empty profession of faith in Christ and you think you're saved and you're not.
[time=2118] You think you're born again and you're not.
[time=2120] You think you have life and you don't and you are inoculated by this false religious confession
[time=2127] of faith of some sort that is merely intellectual to the reality of your own sin, the impending doom, the disastrous condition of your spiritual soul and your lukewarm and it breaks the heart
[time=2138] of Christ because you think you're saved and you're not.
[time=2141] You carry about an illusion about yourself that all is well between you and God and it's not.
[time=2147] It's a false peace and a false sense of security and really nothing can be done to save that kind of a person.
[time=2154] They become very difficult to evangelize because they don't feel they need anything and you know these kinds of people.
[time=2160] They're wrapped up in remarkably liberal churches which have given up on the inerrancy of the Word of God and true conversion and yet because they're in this church and their parents have been in this church and they've joined that church and they've done some external things that that church requires of them they assume they're saved and no one is further from Christ no one is further from salvation than a person who has made an intellectual ascent a non genuine
[time=2184] commitment to Christ and reality has not a genuine faith to back that up.
[time=2192] That is what the definition of lukewarm is and that is why it is so sickening.
[time=2197] Christ is saying better you were cold, better you were openly antagonistic to the things of God so at least you'd know where you stand, better you would sense the chill of separation from God and feel the bitter biting severity of your sin than to have this pseudo peace
[time=2212] of lukewarm religion that makes you think you're well when you are in fact ill.
[time=2219] Some churches make the Lord sad, some churches make the Lord angry, this church makes the
[time=2225] Lord physically ill.
[time=2228] Let me show you why let's go further an understanding of this look at verse 17 because he says you
[time=2235] say now this is what they think about themselves this is an articulation of their lukewarm condition I am rich and I have become wealthy and have need of nothing again that would have been
[time=2248] common words for the people of that city to say and in fact that was true of them financially they were rich and they were wealthy and they really have need of little in a financial way and Christ isn't condemning that, Christ isn't saying it's wrong to be rich or wrong to be wealthy what are you saying is you think you are spiritually rich, you think you are spiritually endowed and wealthy and complete and whole and you're not and this would have
[time=2276] been typical of the Gnostic faith remember now back to Colossae the Gnostic religion that
[time=2283] was invading that little church at Colossae and also layered to see in Herropolis the Gnostics believe that they have gone beyond the knowledge of Christ they have ascended to a higher knowledge
[time=2294] they have gone beyond the simplicity of Christ they have transcended the mundane things of
[time=2300] Christ and the word and somehow philosophically they've elevated themselves past Christ into
[time=2306] this marvelous knowledge of spiritual things they actually believe themselves to be spiritually
[time=2312] rich and wealthy because they had denied the deity of Christ and assumed different things and pontificated their own kind of false belief about Him that's why in Colossians 2 verse
[time=2324] 3 you don't have to turn there it says this about Christ in Christ are hidden all the treasures
[time=2330] of wisdom and knowledge in Christ are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge if
[time=2336] you want real wisdom and real knowledge you go to Christ and Christ alone the minute you go past Christ the minute you redefine Christ you've just abandoned the source of real wisdom
[time=2346] and real knowledge and then they not only say they're rich and they're wealthy they go and they say now see and we have need of nothing we have everything we need that makes them unreachable their spiritual pride their complacency their self satisfaction makes them
[time=2361] absolutely unreachable to the gospel because they don't believe they have any need for it what does Christ say about their true condition look at it in verse 17 this is where he really
[time=2372] heats it up the middle of the verse and you do not know that you are wretched and miserable
[time=2381] and poor and blind and naked you think you're wealthy you think you're rich and you think
[time=2388] you have need of nothing the facts are these you are wretched you are miserable and you are blind poor and naked these words wretched and miserable describe their spiritual state
[time=2401] in other words he comes to them like an accountant and says I will do a spiritual audit of your
[time=2408] spiritual resources and when he comes up to them and says at the end of his audit is you are wretched and you are miserable you are in a bad way you're in a bad condition why
[time=2419] because you're poor you're blind and you're naked now that should start ringing some bells in your mind this is the city that was the financial treasure chest of asia miner and
[time=2429] he says to them you're broke you're poor this is the city that boasted of medicinal
[time=2436] eyesab that gave everyone sight and he said you're blind this is the city that said we make the most gorgeous wall in all the known world we are the best dressed of everybody
[time=2447] and he says you are naked you are wretched and you are miserable because you are poor
[time=2454] you are blind and you're naked the three things that that city was most known for he uses and
[time=2461] it must have exploded in their minds I mean they must have heard those words and understood the spiritual connotations behind it because of the metaphor and just been devastated by that we the Gnostics the Laodiceans we who think we have everything spiritually were poor
[time=2481] were bankrupt were blind and were naked they are the objects of extreme pity as if he's
[time=2491] saying to them you are in the sickening condition of thinking you're rich when you're poor of assuming yourselves to be beautiful when you are in fact ugly of believing you are to be
[time=2501] envied when in fact you are to be pitied of thinking you have everything when you have nothing and of believing you are spiritually clothed when you are spiritually naked so he
[time=2511] just unleashes on them in his condemnation now number six the command follow along as
[time=2521] I read verses 18 19 and 20 I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire that you
[time=2531] may become rich and white garments that you may close yourself and that the shame of your
[time=2537] nakedness may not be revealed and I salve to anoint your eyes that you may see verse
[time=2543] 19 those whom I love I reprove and discipline be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand
[time=2551] at the door knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door I will come into him and will dine with him and he with me we call this a command it's really an invitation and
[time=2562] the whole tone of this letter just shifts at this point and you go from these scathing
[time=2569] rebukes and unmitigated denunciation of their spiritual condition this just stripping them of all spiritual dignity with a real harsh and penetrating tone the whole thing shifts
[time=2580] in verses 18 19 and 20 and you hear this soft hearted compassionate heart of Christ calling
[time=2588] out for them to change that and showing them out verse 18 he says buy something from me
[time=2597] if you're the city of commerce if you're the city of trade if you're the ones who have made fortunes by your ability to buy and sell come to me and buy by gold refined by fire
[time=2607] that you may become truly rich you say what is that I mean spiritually what's he talking about gold in the New Testament is often referred to our faith first Peter 1 7 the proof of your
[time=2620] faith being more precious than gold which is perishable even though tested by fire it
[time=2627] is our faith that is compared to gold that can go through the refiner's fire and and as it does improving itself to be true and real and genuine makes us eternally rich James
[time=2637] to five says those who are rich in faith he is saying you have no faith because you put
[time=2645] your intellectual belief in somebody other than me a deformed Jesus and it's doomed you
[time=2652] it's made you bankrupt it's made you naked it's made you blind but common by for me the
[time=2659] true pure gold of saving faith and you will become unbelievably rich and of course this
[time=2666] word by that runs all the way through verse 18 it doesn't mean that you can earn it he's not advocating works salvation this is Isaiah 55 from a couple of weeks ago when he said you who have no money come by and eat come by wine and milk without money and without cost you buy the gold of faith through acknowledging that you're spiritually destitute and there's
[time=2686] nothing you could do to earn salvation that's the way you buy the gold of heaven by an admission
[time=2693] of absolute dependence you fall prostate on your face and ask for forgiveness for you know that you in fact are poor blind and naked that's what he's inviting them to do come by
[time=2703] he also advises them in verse 18 to buy the white garments it says they're the white garments
[time=2709] that you may clothe yourself and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed
[time=2715] that's a picture of a conquering nation Isaiah 22 describes as Syria saying to their captive
[time=2721] Egypt we will bring you naked and barefoot with buttocks uncovered to the shame of Egypt
[time=2729] it was common in that day for the conquering army to parade their enemy those they have
[time=2736] the foe they have vanquished through their city streets in this very obvious position
[time=2742] of embarrassment literally naked barefoot with buttocks uncovered and what Christ is
[time=2748] saying is pleading with them I don't want that to happen with you if you stay the way you are come day of judgment you will be paraded in all the nakedness of your shame you will
[time=2759] be seen spiritually naked spiritually uncovered you'll be known by all who are there as wretched
[time=2765] and miserable and poor and blind and naked don't let that happen receive from me the white garments exchange your proud trust in this in this black glossy wool and take from
[time=2777] me the white pure garments of the righteousness of Christ and that's what the garments are
[time=2783] in the New Testament always they are the speaking of the righteousness of Christ to be clothed
[time=2789] with the cloak of the righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ to take on his purity and his holiness to drape it over us so that when God looks at us all God sees is this marvelous
[time=2801] garment of the righteousness of Christ instead of us in our wretched miserable condition
[time=2809] so he invites them to have imputed to them the very righteousness of Christ the new heart the new soul the new mind the new commitment a new way of life make everything different
[time=2821] and then thirdly in verse 18 he invites them to buy at the end of that verse the eyesave
[time=2828] to anoint your eyes that you may see they were blind spiritually they were absolutely
[time=2834] blind and you know you're blind when you can't see Jesus for who he is when you make something
[time=2840] less of Jesus you're to be most pitied of all for your severity of blindness this would
[time=2847] be the ministry of the Holy Spirit John 16 8 and 9 speaking of the Holy Spirit says and he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment concerning sin because they did not believe in me so if you'll come and buy my eyesave it will be to you
[time=2863] the Holy Spirit and the spirit of God will open your spiritual blindness and you'll see Christ
[time=2869] for who he is and you'll see yourself for who you are and you'll have life now verse
[time=2878] 19 and I appreciate this so much about our Lord he says those whom I love in other words
[time=2884] I love you and I'm saying this to you because I love you those whom I love I reprove and
[time=2890] discipline I reprove and I discipline the word reprove means a verbal rebuke that's
[time=2898] designed to bring a person to acknowledge their fault when you reprove someone you are rebuking
[time=2906] them but in your heart it's not to have a feeling of superiority you're doing that because you want them to see the error of their way that's what Christ is saying I know I've been
[time=2917] harsh I know I've kind of pulled out the stops here in these first several verses and I've reduced you to nothing but I want you to know I do that as a faithful friend faithful are
[time=2929] the wounds of a friend and I reprove you this way because I want you to identify and acknowledge your sin and your guilt and your trouble so that you can come to me and have life and if reprove our words to bring about conviction then discipline is defined as action that brings
[time=2946] about discipline and he threatens that look at the verse 16 because you're lukewarm neither hot nor cold I will spit you out of my mouth I will spit you I am about to vomit you I'm
[time=2957] about to throw you out I haven't done it yet but I'm about to and so he not only says these words are a sign of my love but I'm going to bring travesty into your life and tragedy beyond belief and calamity and trauma so that you'll finally wake up and see how desperate
[time=2973] you really are because I love you and I want you to be saved verse 19 he concludes be zealous
[time=2982] therefore and repent there is no salvation without repentance you'll hear it in this passage
[time=2992] and you'll hear it in a hundred other passages in the New Testament unless a person comes to the place that they recognize themselves as miserable and wretched and blind and poor
[time=3002] and naked in a spiritual sense there is no salvation he is saying repent which means
[time=3009] to change your mind change your mind about your condition stop saying you're rich and wealthy and have need of nothing and start saying we have need of everything stop thinking
[time=3019] wrong thoughts about me and start acknowledging me as the amen and the faithful witness and the beginning of the creation of God repent and be saved and then verse 20 behold which
[time=3034] is a way of saying hey wait a minute everybody don't lose don't miss this point wake up you know take notice behold I'm standing at the door and I'm knocking if anyone hears my voice
[time=3046] and opens the door I'll come into him and dine with him and he with me and maybe in Sunday school you've seen a little picture of Jesus standing at the door of somebody's heart knocking to come in I don't think this is the door of somebody's heart this is the door of the church at Laodicea he wants to come in he's standing outside his own church
[time=3064] saying do you mind if I come in would somebody open the door the irony and the sarcasm is
[time=3070] unbelievable you say you're a Christian church you say you believe in Christ but you believe in the wrong Christ and it leaves me on the outside and I'm knocking I'd like to come in the church which is another evidence that there are no believers in the church in other
[time=3084] words we bring Christ into this church when we come in here because he is in us Christ in us the hope of glory he doesn't show up here just with nobody he comes in with us he dwell and dwells us and he lives in us and when he when he does that and he comes into this church and we're in this church together there was nobody in that church who had Christ in their life he's saying will somebody in that unregenerate church please hear the
[time=3108] plead of me and open the door of your heart your life your church so that I can come in
[time=3114] he says if you do I want to dine with you I want to have fellowship with you which is
[time=3122] just the ancient picture of remarkable love and friendship and even today it's the people we are closest to that we want to eat with and we sit down with them and we enjoy a good
[time=3133] meal but it's the conversation and it's the fellowship and it's the catching up of old times he's saying I want to do that with you I want to come into your church and I want to have fellowship with you and then we come to verses 21 and 22 as we bring our little
[time=3150] message to an end the council the council what does he say he says to the overcomer
[time=3156] he who overcomes you who are truly born of God if you will respond to this and be born of God this is what I want to give you I want to grant to him to sit with me on my throne
[time=3171] as I also overcame and sat down with my father on his throne you know what throne is this
[time=3177] Christ is saying I want you to come and sit down on my throne which is a symbol of authority
[time=3184] and the right to rule you're saying I want to give you the right to have authority and to rule in the millennial kingdom and in eternity forever remarkable isn't it they
[time=3195] go if they'll come to Christ from being wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked to being at the status of a king having a throne to rule and reign as vice monarchs
[time=3208] with Christ so full is his forgiveness so free and compassionate is his heart and then
[time=3217] verse 22 he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches you're saying
[time=3224] please don't have a deaf ear please don't shut yourself off to this communication you
[time=3230] desperately need this this is life-giving it can change your entire circumstances both now and for all of eternity and in characteristic form he pleads with them that's our Christ
[time=3246] I found myself this week feeling like I was studying more about Christ than I was about even this church you know the beginning of this book Revelation 1 1 says the revelation
[time=3257] of Jesus Christ this is a book designed to open up and to reveal the person of Jesus
[time=3264] Christ and I don't know about you but the people I become most angry with the people
[time=3272] I am least likely to want to forgive the people that I want to if you will spew out
[time=3279] of my life are the people who have said something that that defame my character have said things
[time=3287] about me that are not true and have influenced other people's opinion about me and that is
[time=3295] exactly what Laodicea had done this ungodly church in its all of its spiritual pride
[time=3302] had redefined the very person of Christ in their heresy about him and they have told
[time=3309] everybody in Laodicea this is who Christ really is he's not really God and as a result of
[time=3318] believing that lie they have no saving faith they have no regenerate people and I identify
[time=3326] with Christ at the beginning when he says I just want to I just want to spit you out of my mind out of my life I never want to see you again but you know he doesn't say that
[time=3337] out of his own angry anger out of his own sense of self protection he doesn't say that because he he wants to get even with them he's saying that because he loves them and he needs
[time=3347] them they need to know that's how repulsive they are to him that's how far off the mark they are and then he comes back and says I love you and the only reason I'm saying
[time=3358] that is because I love you and I'm standing here knocking will you let me in and if you
[time=3365] do I'm gonna let you share in my authority and my rule through the millennium and through
[time=3374] the end of the age for all eternity that's some kind of Christ I want to be like that
[time=3381] when the Bible says be like Christ that's kind of part of what it means be able to take
[time=3387] the people who have violated you the deepest and the most and grant them forgiveness and
[time=3393] wish and convey for them nothing but good will and allow them to have fellowship with
[time=3400] you it's remarkable let's pray together I'm thankful that you watched the Bible
