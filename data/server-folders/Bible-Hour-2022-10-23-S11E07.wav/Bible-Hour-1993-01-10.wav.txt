[time=0] 3500 years ago, about 2 million Jews stood at the edge of the Red Sea, and that a word
[time=11] from Moses, they waited in, and the sea parted, and the Bible says they crossed on dry land.
[time=23] The New Testament tells us that they did this by faith.
[time=28] And we admire their courage and their trust and say how wonderful their faith was.
[time=37] But just a few hours after that, the Egyptian chariot drivers did the very same thing, and
[time=46] every one of them was drought.

[time=482] Well thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. Our pastor Russell Moore is in California.
[time=489] He picked a very perfect week to go to the west coast as we're experiencing quite a snowstorm
[time=495] as we record this Sunday's program but nevertheless we're glad that you've tuned in with us and again
[time=501] we're thankful for those of you that support the Bible Hour through your regular prayers and giving. Today I'm standing in the new gymnasium which is just about complete and with me is our
[time=512] school administrator Steve Longbreak. Good morning Steve. Morning Pete. While this is exciting to see this building particularly the gymnasium tell us a little bit about the progress of our new building. These are great days. It looks like in about one month we'll be moving into our new building. Our 10 classrooms and gymnasium are almost completed and it is thrilling for the Sunday
[time=531] school people and our school people as well to get ready to move in here. I was amazed as I went through the locker rooms to see how spacious they are and I know one of the highlights is the new chemistry laboratory. That laboratory is a ball for our science people to go into and just look
[time=546] at what's developing in there. And Steve being a former coach obviously this gymnasium exciting to you. We were watching them do the floor and it won't be long just a couple days we'll have a brand new wood floor down here. That's right it's really beautiful. I never dreamed that the Lord would choose to bless us as this greatly but he has. I'm thankful for that. Steve what does this mean in terms of student enrollment for next year? Do we have some openings? We have some openings
[time=571] in kindergarten through 5th grade and also in 10th grade for next year. If you're interested in applying to Black Hawk Christian School you can call us at 4937400 K through 5 have some openings
[time=584] and 10th grade. Well I'm very excited about the Christian School and if you have any interest at all don't wait any longer but call that number again it'll be on the screen it's 4937400 and
[time=596] ask for the Christian School office and they'll give you information on how you can enroll your
[time=602] children in next falls program here at Black Hawk Christian School. Well we're delighted that we're
[time=609] into the new year and we continue to be thankful for the ministry of the Bible hour and how it reaches particularly shut-ins. Our secretary Marge brought me a list of prayer requests this morning and
[time=620] also a letter from a man in Fort Wayne that wrote and said I bowed my head and asked
[time=626] I prayed the prayer that you prayed at the end of the service to ask Jesus Christ into my heart and that was exciting for us and so we're thankful that we have the opportunity to provide you with the Bible hour every week and then as you noted in the last couple weeks we have been offering to you

[time=675] regular portion of our service with our special guest Dr. Homer Kent speaking stay with us as you
[time=682] hear more music and the message today
[time=696] amen thank you scott you might ask the question when peter kobe gets up about 5 30 on sunday morning and it's snowing out
[time=710] like it is and past her russes in california getting ready to do a clinic there what is the first
[time=716] thoughts that goes through his mind well the first thought is how is this guest speaker going to get
[time=722] here where is he is he in fort Wayne is he in Warsaw so that's the first thing that i did this
[time=728] morning just as soon as i thought i could call Becky woman and ask her if her father and mother
[time=734] were in this area and she assured me that dr kent was in fort Wayne and i was very much relieved and
[time=741] and you are demonstrating the same thought that i had a few hours ago we're delighted that
[time=748] as i mentioned the pastor russes in california and we'll be ministering at master's college you
[time=754] might want to pray for him this week see fellowships there and ministers to the students and also hopefully he'll have some good fellowship with some of the men that with whom he's worked in the past dr kent is a friend of ours from Warsaw indiana he has been a faculty member at grace
[time=771] schools for since 1949 that's a long time of faithful service to the lord he presently is
[time=779] professor emeritus in the new testament department there he's been the president of the school for ten years and but perhaps most importantly he's the father of becky woman and the father-in-law of
[time=792] gerry woman who are in our church and we appreciate the cancers they come over from Warsaw regularly
[time=799] for our special programs and for their grandchildren's programs and just have supported us and we
[time=805] we consider them friends of black hawk baptist church and in just a few minutes doctor kent will be speaking to us this morning before he comes though i'd like to have his daughter becky come and minister to us in music let's open our hearts to the message that she has in song
[time=822] here is much confusion in the world today
[time=845] peace has turned to fighting and love has turned to hate this is not what god intended this is not
[time=857] what he had planned things are very different now than when we first began we say god is our father
[time=874] we say we trust in him we have left his ways for our ways and fallen into sin yet we claim
[time=885] to seek forgiveness and we say we'll follow him but god would not have led us to this place where we
[time=897] now live the only hope for the world is jesus the only hope for the earth in the touch from god
[time=912] oh how we need him we must seek him with all of our heart and all our soul there is no other
[time=926] have we known then jesus cried the only hope for the world oh it's time for all of the people
[time=943] to call upon the lord and pray to god almighty to touch and heal our world though if every heart
[time=955] would be humbled and each soul would turn to god and love would rain in every heart and love would
[time=966] be not the only hope for the world is jesus the only hope for the earth in the touch from god
[time=983] oh how we need him we must seek him with all of our heart and all our soul there is no other
[time=996] have we known then jesus cried the only hope for the world the only peace is the prince that
[time=1008] be moving in our hearts today and the only good news is the good news that jesus is the way
[time=1020] the only hope for the world is jesus the only hope for the earth in the touch from god
[time=1038] oh how we need him we must seek him with all of our heart and all our soul there is no other
[time=1051] have we known then jesus cried the only hope for the world we must seek him there is no other have
[time=1066] we know then jesus cried the only hope for the world
[time=1097] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1103] the message of that song act as a theme for our meditation this morning
[time=1118] 3500 years ago about two million jews stood on the banks of the red sea
[time=1125] and at a word from moses they waited in the sea parted and the bible says they
[time=1135] walked across as on dry land the new testament tells us in hebrews 11 29 that it was by faith
[time=1146] that the red sea waters parted we admire their courage their trust in god and say how wonderful
[time=1156] their faith was but a few hours after that some egyptian chariot drivers did the very same thing
[time=1168] and every one of them was drowned faith must be a complicated matter
[time=1176] it isn't just trust it isn't just daring it isn't just courage
[time=1186] for those egyptians were just as daring as the israelites were
[time=1193] for centuries jewish people have recited this shama their confession of the oneness of god
[time=1200] here oh israel the lord thy god the lord is one it's an expression of their faith in contrast
[time=1208] to the pagan idolatry all around them and we commend them for their faith but the bible says
[time=1218] that the demons also believe that god is one and they have no doubts about it and yet every one of
[time=1227] them is rejected by god faith is not as simple as it sounds missionaries and evangelists who
[time=1237] minister in foreign cultures caution us about taking at face value all the reports we may hear
[time=1246] in this country about thousands of people raising their hands or signing a card or praying a prayer
[time=1253] they've cautioned us that some of that is not exactly what it seems to be
[time=1259] apparently faith involves more than we may have supposed what is the faith that saves after all
[time=1271] we hear all kinds of popular songs statements of various sorts that you just have to have faith
[time=1278] and things will work out what is the faith that saves
[time=1284] in the world of religious thought there's also a continuing tension
[time=1290] about the relationship of faith and the way we live do they have any relationship to each other
[time=1301] it's the old conflict between creed what i believe and conduct how i live
[time=1309] do they have a relationship should they have are they two totally different issues i do one
[time=1320] thing on sunday and what i do the rest of the week has no relationship to what i do on sunday
[time=1327] does what i believe have anything to do with how i behave are they cause perhaps an effect
[time=1336] and the effect is merely a hope for byproduct that may or may not occur
[time=1343] or is it an inevitable consequence of my faith does what i believe determine
[time=1355] how i live the bible talks about this very issue in a number of passages
[time=1362] and some of the most prominent occur in the apostle paul and in the writings of james
[time=1368] and one of the interesting things is that when we read paul and james together
[time=1374] there are occasions when it sounds like they really are saying something quite different
[time=1381] let me illustrate from the book of roman's chapter four where paul was writing about
[time=1387] what saves people what gives them a relationship to god that merits his approval
[time=1397] and he makes it very clear that it's faith not works and he uses abraham as his illustration
[time=1408] and he cites a particular passage from the old testament to prove that i'm reading from roman's
[time=1414] four the first five verses what then shall we say that abraham our forefather according to the
[time=1421] flesh has found for if abraham was justified by works he has something to boast about
[time=1428] but not before god for what does the scripture say and abraham believed god and it was reckoned
[time=1437] to him as righteousness not to the one who works his wage is not reckoned as a favor but as what is
[time=1444] due but to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly his faith is
[time=1453] reckoned as righteousness paul seems very clear it's faith that saves not works abraham's experience
[time=1464] proves it but then you turn over to the epistle of james chapter two and you find that james
[time=1474] discusses the very same issue of faith and works and he also uses abraham as his illustration
[time=1483] and even quotes the same verse from the old testament and seems to be using it to prove
[time=1493] the very opposite from paul i'm reading from chapter two verse 21
[time=1500] was not abraham our father justified by works when he offered up isek his son on the altar
[time=1509] you see that faith was working with his works and as a result of the works
[time=1516] faith was perfected and the scripture was fulfilled what scripture the very same one paul used
[time=1524] which says abraham believed god and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend
[time=1531] of god are they contradicting each other some people think so one of the great protestant reformers
[time=1543] even referred to the epistle of james is a right strawy epistle because it doesn't come across
[time=1549] at least it did not to him as clearly on the doctrine of justification by faith
[time=1555] as martin luther thought it ought to what does the bible teach us anyway what is the faith that saves is it just any kind of faith
[time=1571] or is it a very certain kind of faith i want to direct your attention this morning to the second
[time=1578] chapter of james beginning with verse 14 to the end of the chapter well concentrate on james because
[time=1586] most of us i suppose in this audience are have a clear understanding of paul's teaching
[time=1594] the salvation comes by grace through faith plus nothing it's a free offer of the lord jesus christ
[time=1604] in which god offers to give us righteousness make us fit for his presence for all eternity
[time=1612] on the basis of the price that the lord jesus paid for us at calvary when he laid down his life for us
[time=1621] it's james that causes the problems so let's look at that today james makes two propositions in this paragraph the first one is that faith without works is dead
[time=1638] faith without works is dead and he demonstrates that by showing three things that are wrong
[time=1646] with that kind of faith if there is no activity if there is no evidence of one's faith
[time=1656] james says not that it's sick not that it needs a few things added to it james says it's dead
[time=1670] dead because there are three things wrong number one it doesn't save the person who claims it
[time=1678] verse 14 what uses it my brethren if a man says he has faith but he has no works can that
[time=1687] faith save him here's the person who makes a claim oh i am a christian
[time=1696] but if you didn't hear him say it you never know it he may recite the lord's prayer on
[time=1704] sunday morning he may recite the apostles creed he may know the right words to say
[time=1711] that's on sunday morning but the rest of the week you can't tell any difference between him and
[time=1719] anybody else if a man says he has faith notice james doesn't say if he has faith
[time=1725] but if he says he has it if he makes the claim but there's no evidence james asks the question
[time=1734] can that faith saving and the way he phrases that question in the language in which he wrote
[time=1742] makes it very clear that the answer expected of that question is no that kind of faith can't save it when i was a lad i had a king james russian like everybody else
[time=1755] and uh it didn't read quite like this james two fourteen the last part of it reads can faith
[time=1766] save him and i want to say yes to that faith is what saves us paul certainly makes that clear
[time=1776] and so when we translate it can faith saving and the answer to that according to james is no
[time=1783] we have a problem the problem is in the translation and not in james because the translators of that
[time=1794] earlier version of our bibles left out of work there's an article before the word faith
[time=1801] so to simply translate can faith save doesn't fairly represent what james wrote james wrote
[time=1810] can the faith that he claims to have but there's no evidence can that faith save him i was reading
[time=1820] this morning from the new american standard version which i have in front of me and they've used the word that can that sort of faith saving and that makes it much clearer
[time=1831] james says just saying you have it doesn't make it so the old negro spiritual used to have it
[time=1842] not everybody talk about heaven is a go on there just saying so doesn't make it so
[time=1849] you see james isn't arguing in contradiction from paul that we need two things to save us
[time=1855] faith plus works and those two together save james is saying you need a certain kind of faith a kind of faith that works
[time=1867] that is alive not just a profession that's profession only and nothing more
[time=1878] faith that works not just empty claim if all you have is empty claim
[time=1884] james says that doesn't help you there's something else wrong with a faith that doesn't have any works
[time=1892] verses 15 to 17 say it doesn't help anybody else either he uses an illustration from everyday life of their christian congregation i presume
[time=1906] where there's some christian brother or sister that is that's fallen on hard times maybe through persecution and he's lost everything or he's lost his job or whatever if a brother or a sister
[time=1920] is without clothing and in need of daily food and one of you says to them go in peace be
[time=1929] warmed and be filled and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body what use is that
[time=1936] he's writing to jewish christians and he says if you see one of your christian brothers
[time=1944] in desperate need of material goods and all you can do is give the usual greeting
[time=1954] shalom peace be warmed be filled but you don't help me
[time=1961] what good is that it's like one of us saying to a needy christian brother well
[time=1968] the lord bless you and that's all we do forgetting that these are brothers and sisters in christ
[time=1978] that we are members of the same spiritual family that we have a spiritual responsibility
[time=1984] to one another to assist in time of need to show the kind of love that god in christ has shown to us
[time=1992] this is not a unique idea with james in our rivals
[time=1998] paul said the same thing he wrote in first timothy chapter five
[time=2006] that if any christian has believers in his family and he was thinking of those particularly
[time=2013] in need and thinking of needy widows and you don't do anything about it you have denied the faith
[time=2021] and are worse than an unbeliever because even unbelievers recognize that there is family
[time=2028] responsibility they don't always fulfill that responsibility but they recognize it exists
[time=2036] certainly christians ought to and if we shut our lives to that sort of thing
[time=2043] we're worse he says than unbelievers john taught the same thing in first john chapter three verse 17
[time=2050] he writes whosoever has this world's goods and sees his brother having a need and shuts up his
[time=2060] heart of compassion against him how can you say the love of god dwells in him how indeed
[time=2068] true christianity has made us new creations says the new testament
[time=2077] it has made us sharers of god's life of compassion there should be evidence therefore
[time=2086] if you have new life because life always evidences itself in fact he says in verse 17
[time=2096] even so faith if it has no works is dead by itself those last two words have posed a challenge
[time=2110] for translators probably forever because the original text just has two words
[time=2118] that could be translated according to itself but it isn't all that clear exactly how that fits
[time=2127] together the translators of the version i have have supplied the word being it's in italics
[time=2133] to tell me it's a supplied word being by itself you could translate that preposition by as measured
[time=2142] by often it's carries the idea of measurement so that the sense would be something like this
[time=2148] faith that has no works no demonstrations no evidence is dead as measured by itself if you just look at the claim that this person has
[time=2162] but then you examine all the ramifications and you see nothing positive coming out of it
[time=2169] you draw some conclusions when you see a body lying down it may look like a man
[time=2179] same general dimensions same features same profile
[time=2186] but when the coroner comes and he examines on the basis of the body itself when he finds no heartbeat
[time=2196] no pulse looks at the eyes as measured by itself he will say even though it looks like a living man
[time=2208] it's a dead man james says when you look at somebody's claim to have christian faith
[time=2215] and you find nothing but claim there's nothing coming out of it
[time=2223] there's no kind of demonstrations and here is life and vitality and something has changed
[time=2230] something's happened you conclude it's dead what's wrong with that kind of faith it doesn't help
[time=2239] the one who claims it it doesn't help anybody else either in fact the third thing he says about it
[time=2248] it's incapable of showing to anyone that it even exists
[time=2255] someone may well say you have faith and i have works show me your faith without the works and i will show you my faith by my works the only way you can demonstrate that you really have
[time=2270] genuine saving living faith is by the evidences of your life
[time=2278] and if there are no evidences there james says well show me your faith apart from those works and he
[time=2286] knows there's nothing to show even a person who may make a claim and say well i did make the profession
[time=2296] i did say the words james says verse 19 you believe that god is one you do well
[time=2307] every jewish christian even before they became christians used to recite recite that jewish
[time=2313] confession the lord thy god the lord is one but james says even the demons believe that god is one
[time=2322] and they're not just saying that without accepting the fact they shudder because they know god is one
[time=2332] and they know their doom is certain one occasion demons said to jesus don't cast us into the abyss
[time=2338] before the time they had no doubts about what their future prospect held but even though they believed that that was in store for them and they believed that there is
[time=2350] one god that didn't save them because simply knowing something intellectually
[time=2360] is far different from that trust in god that accepts his promises and allows him to make of
[time=2367] them new creations in christ and give them new life and set their feet on a different path
[time=2373] faith without works says james is dead i'm glad he doesn't leave us on that note
[time=2383] he has a second proposition he wants to declare and that is that the faith which saves us
[time=2389] the faith which wins god's approval is a faith that works verses 20 to 26
[time=2401] he says do you want some demonstration of that would you readers you hearers like to know that
[time=2409] that is really how it operates let me give you an illustration and it goes to abraham
[time=2415] the friend of god the father of that jewish nation the one whom we all revere as the great
[time=2423] father of faith would you like to know what kind of faith abraham had do you think all he did was recite the right words and claim to have it and that was all
[time=2438] or did he have the kind of life changing faith that demonstrated itself as making a difference
[time=2446] in his life well he says verse 21 was not abraham our father justified by the kind of faith out of
[time=2455] which works flowed when he offered up isek his son on the altar now we have to stop and think
[time=2464] through this just a little bit that's not supposed to james is saying that when abraham offered isek
[time=2471] on the altar that was the moment of his conversion of his being brought to god years before that
[time=2483] abraham believed god and it was counted as righteousness
[time=2490] this passage takes place in genesis 22 but long before isek was ever born in genesis 15 verse 6
[time=2500] the statement is made that abraham believed god and of course he believed god even before
[time=2507] genesis 15 he believed god in genesis 12 when god told him to leave his homeland to come to a
[time=2514] place that he would show him and so he did what james is demonstrating is the kind of faith that
[time=2522] abraham had abraham had the kind of faith that saved that god pronounced him justified or righteous
[time=2529] or acceptable to him on the basis of it what kind of faith was it james as i'll tell you what kind
[time=2536] of faith it was it was the kind of faith that when god said to abraham i want you to sacrifice to me
[time=2545] your son isek he was willing to do it i'm glad god never asked me to do something like that
[time=2559] but abraham had the kind of faith that was willing to say if god clearly indicates this is what he
[time=2568] is asking me to do i'll do it what a conflict that must have put into the mind of abraham
[time=2577] god had promised to him i'll make of you a great nation and give blessing to you and through you
[time=2586] to all the nations of the world and abraham had no children
[time=2592] later on he had ishmael by the slave woman and then isek through sarah
[time=2602] and there came a time when abraham asked some questions that god said to him in isek
[time=2612] will i fulfill this promise in isek will your descendants be called and now he's asking him
[time=2619] to sacrifice isek when isek has no children how is god going to fulfill that promise to abraham
[time=2627] if isek is taken before there any offspring but abraham never faltered in fact the book of hebrew says that he didn't expecting god the
[time=2641] resurrecting tremendous faith no wonder jewish people honored him as the father of the faithful of the believing
[time=2652] ones our author james tells us that was the kind of faith that abraham had and when he did it
[time=2664] his faith was the kind that was working verse 22 with his works and as a result of the works
[time=2673] his faith was perfected or completed doesn't say his faith was created at that time
[time=2682] but his faith became fully developed he always had that kind of faith
[time=2692] but when that moment of the greatest test of his life occurred that's when his faith reached
[time=2699] its highest level of growth and maturity he always had that kind of faith
[time=2705] but the offering of isek brought it to full growth perhaps we could illustrate it by a very
[time=2714] homely illustration i have a maple tree in my front yard and every spring our yard is covered
[time=2722] with little seedlings that sprout up to be an inch or two high what are those little annoyances
[time=2731] in my front yard they're little maple trees that's what they are they're not anything else they'll
[time=2737] never grow up and yield tomatoes they're maple trees and yet we can certainly say that those
[time=2746] little maple trees have not been perfected or completed until they would grow and produce
[time=2754] seedlings of their own but they were always maple trees so abraham long before he offered isek
[time=2764] had saving faith it was brought to its highest development and we can all grow in faith in our
[time=2772] christian lives he came to its highest development when he offered isek but it was always that kind
[time=2778] of faith and if abraham had died before the isek episode occurred he still had saving faith
[time=2787] and god pronounced him righteous but his was the kind of faith that worked well i can imagine that some of those early readers might have been saying to themselves
[time=2799] james your letter is uh convincing and it's interesting but i'm finding it difficult to relate
[time=2808] myself to abraham because he we have him on a pedestal he's the founder of our nation
[time=2816] he had the most sublime faith that most of us shouldered even think about trying to follow all right says james i'll give you illustration number two we'll go to the other extreme in the social circle we'll go to rayhab the harlot
[time=2834] the woman of shady reputation a Canaanite from jerry co
[time=2845] what about her you recall the incident from the old testament that when josh was set out the
[time=2851] spies to look over the land of canan before the israelites would move in to take over that this Canaanite woman who lived in jerry co sheltered the spies hid them sent them out by a
[time=2867] different way to escape the wrath of the Canaanite leaders why did she do that let's look at the
[time=2876] passage verse 25 in the same way was not rayhab the harlot also justified declared righteous
[time=2886] by works when she received the messengers the spies and sent them out by another way
[time=2896] what happened that came a day when this Canaanite woman
[time=2902] along with the others in her city of jerry co must have stood on the walls of their city
[time=2911] and looked out across the jordan river to the valley on the far side and perhaps seen some of
[time=2918] that horde of two million israelites a threat to her country she may have heard some of the
[time=2928] stories going around of how this people used to be slaves in egypt the most powerful kingdom of
[time=2935] that day and their god brought them out a series of miracles that were imposed upon the nation of
[time=2946] israel and brought her to her knees god led them out into the wilderness a place where you really
[time=2953] couldn't survive very long without some help and and he fed them 40 years even their shoes didn't
[time=2961] wear out she heard about all that and rayhab decided i want to be a part of the worshipers of
[time=2974] the god of israel but that was no mere idol passing fancy on her part she believed it
[time=2984] with the kind of faith that was alive something happened to her god changed her heart
[time=2995] and she demonstrated the reality of her faith by the life she lived thereafter
[time=3001] i'm sure that the name rayhab the harlot got attached to her because of her former life
[time=3010] surely she abandoned that lifestyle which he came into the knowledge of the true god
[time=3019] but memories are long in the middle east simon the leper entertained jesus and the disciples for
[time=3025] dinner he could not have still been a leper if jesus and the disciples had gone there for dinner
[time=3031] he must have been one of those lepers that jesus healed but he had gotten the name and he
[time=3037] never could get rid of it i think that's true of rayhab later on she becomes of one of the ancestors of jesus himself according to matthew's genealogy in matthew chapter one
[time=3049] what kind of faith did she have empty profession oh no she trusted the god of israel
[time=3058] and her works demonstrated therefore our author can say as the body without the spirit is dead
[time=3070] so also faith without works is dead how can we bring paul and james together
[time=3078] i read a story many years ago that illustrated it i think in a very effective way a little boy
[time=3088] lived in the country with his family and a thunderstorm with crashing thunder and
[time=3099] bright jagged lightning just took over the area for a time and a little boy was frightened and
[time=3107] ran to his room and after it was all over he came out and asked his father as they stood
[time=3114] on the front porch and surveyed the damage and saw the the big tree split down the middle
[time=3121] what made all this wreckage was it the crashing thunder that hurt my ears
[time=3128] or was it the lightning that was so bright and the father said i know that thunder was very loud
[time=3135] that it frightened you and you covered your ears but really it was the lightning that split the oak
[time=3142] tree when you ask the question what saves people faith or works paul answers that question
[time=3154] and he says faith is what saves people and you can never do enough works of law or any other kind
[time=3163] of works to save yourself you have to trust god to do the work for you and he did it when he sent
[time=3172] jesus to die in your place but then the little boy asked another question that he
[time=3180] does all lightning hurt you and the father said well no there's several kinds of lightning
[time=3190] there's a kind of lightning we call summer lightning or heat lightning that comes at the
[time=3197] end of a hot day in our part of the country where you see twilight coming on and the light shimmering
[time=3204] in the heavens and it's noiseless that doesn't hurt anybody so we don't make you come in
[time=3211] we just let you play when we ask the question does all faith save us that's the one james answers
[time=3224] and he says why as a matter of fact no not all faith saves not mere empty claim
[time=3232] that doesn't say not just intellectual awareness that there is a god that doesn't say
[time=3239] only the kind of faith that accepts the promises of god that trusts him not only believes they are
[time=3250] true but says yes i want that for me thank you lord that's when god steps in
[time=3258] and he regenerates he gives new birth he gives new life he makes us brand new
[time=3267] the faith that saves is the faith that is alive it's a faith that works
[time=3278] it's the faith that makes a difference it's a faith that can be seen and while christians grow in their christian lives at different rates and none of us grows as
[time=3291] quickly as we ought and as thoroughly as we ought in our christian perceptions
[time=3300] we all if we have the faith that saves we'll have the kind of faith whereby the holy spirit
[time=3308] makes us new gets us to work makes us active just as there is a discernible difference
[time=3322] between a newborn little baby who's alive and a still birth
[time=3329] so there is a difference between those who just make profession and those who truly trust
[time=3340] with the faith that saves may god grant to each of us the understanding from this passage to make
[time=3349] very sure that we have the kind of faith that saves our father we thank you that you have not
[time=3357] left us on our own but you've instructed us you've done the work and all we need to do is trust
[time=3364] the for it but when we genuinely do it'll make a difference it'll make a difference in the way we
[time=3371] live we want our faith to be more clearly seen as the days go by in jesus name we pray amen
