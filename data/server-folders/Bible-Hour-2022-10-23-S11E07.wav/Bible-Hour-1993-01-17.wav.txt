[time=0] And I think that permeates our culture.
[time=4] I think that permeates Christianity as well as the secular culture, where people are more committed to a kind of life than principles by which to live their lives.
[time=28] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=35] Thank you for joining us.
[time=39] What are your plans for 1993?
[time=42] What are you hoping to see happen in your life over the next 12 months?
[time=46] On today's program, Pastor Moore draws six exciting principles from God's Word that promised to make 1993 the best year of your life.
[time=54] We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study along with us.
[time=58] We will be looking at several different passages during today's study.
[time=62] Our special music today will feature our sanctuary choir, the handbell choir, and read
[time=74] the favor.
[time=78] Let's now join our service.
[time=98] We are gathered in this house to celebrate his name, to tell the ear we're happy, so
[time=114] happy he prayed.
[time=118] We know where they worthy by the burning name, we stand here as no peace of his power to
[time=136] him, oh we worship, oh we worship, Jesus our own, our own, we magnify him, and glorify
[time=160] Jesus our own, we worship, oh He knows us by name, and we're sure that He loves us
[time=185] just the same, and we all need to see him in power and light, and it seems as we praise
[time=201] him, his glory is inside, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship
[time=215] Jesus our own, we magnify him, and glorify him, Jesus our own, oh yes we worship, oh
[time=240] we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh Jesus our own, oh Jesus our
[time=270] own, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship, oh
[time=433] I'm very thankful that you've tuned into the Bible hour today, and if you're watching
[time=449] for the first time, I hope that you will enjoy the ministry of music and the message from our pastor.
[time=455] You've already been inspired, no doubt, by the choir and the handbell choir, and just a few minutes you'll hear soloists read the favor.
[time=463] Our pastor is back this Sunday, and I want to encourage you to stay tuned for the entire broadcast.
[time=468] In just a few minutes, he'll be giving a six-point message on encouragement.
[time=473] Encouragement for the Christian to give 100% toward the serving of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=479] Now I hope you'll listen, and you'll be inspired by what pastor Moore has to say about the way
[time=485] Christians should live and should represent our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=490] Also next week, Pastor Moore will have a guest on the insert, and then his subject will be very timely as he speaks on the issue of abortion.
[time=499] I hope that you'll make a special note to tune in to the Bible hour next week as Pastor Moore speaks on this issue.
[time=506] And then I want to tell you about a special event that's coming up in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church, we're doing a musical program on Sunday evening, February 14th at
[time=516] 6 p.m.
[time=517] We're entitling it Celebrate God's Greatness.
[time=521] It'll be an evening of hymns, of anthems, of choruses involving the sanctuary choir,
[time=528] our orchestra, and our congregation together just celebrating the greatness of our Lord.
[time=534] As note that date, and come with and join with us for this great evening of worship on Sunday, February 14th at 6 p.m.
[time=542] I know that the choir has been working on the music for some time now, and I've really been inspired and encouraged by the variety of music that will just help you and enrich
[time=552] your Christian life.
[time=553] So once again, that Sunday evening, February 14th at 6 p.m.
[time=559] Then last week, I told you about the daily walk calendar, we'll be offering it during the month of January.
[time=565] It's a year calendar, also with some scripture reading, a thought for the day, and a process
[time=571] by which you can read through the entire Bible in one year.
[time=575] Again, it's called the daily walk Bible Calendar, and we want you to receive it absolutely
[time=581] free.
[time=582] You can write to the Bible Hour today at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the
[time=589] zip code is 46815.
[time=592] Once again, just write to the Bible Hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=598] The zip code is 46815.
[time=602] This calendar will be sent to you absolutely free, and we do this partly to give you something that will help you in your Christian life, and also just to confirm the fact that you're
[time=613] watching the Bible Hour, and we'd love to hear from you.
[time=616] We asked last week if there'd be 100 of you that would write in for the calendar, and I hope that next week I can tell you that 100 people wrote in to ask for the calendar, and that'll be a great encouragement to us.
[time=628] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our service for some more music, and then again that timely message from our pastor entitled "Resolutions." I hope that you'll stay tuned for our entire broadcast.
[time=661] Oh, how I love you, how I adore my breath and my sunshine, my all in all.
[time=684] Oh, how I adore you, how I adore you, how I adore you, how I adore you, how I adore
[time=702] you.
[time=703] Down from his glory, have a living story, my God and the Savior came, and the Jesus
[time=723] was his name, born in a manger, to his own astray of every, a man of sorrows, tears and
[time=742] begonies, what condescension, bringing us redemption, that in the dead of night, not
[time=759] one faith, hope was his side, God and his mercy, they decide, his slender, sticky to
[time=776] whom, and when, to save my own soul.
[time=786] Oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how I adore you, how I adore you, how I adore
[time=1588] Wrong. Come with me to one of my favorite verses in the whole Bible, Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10.
[time=1594] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 10. And this is just wonderful. It says there Ephesians 2-10, "For we
[time=1606] are His workmanship." We are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God
[time=1614] prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. This word "workmanship," as it's translated in
[time=1621] my Bible, means masterpiece. You are the very masterpiece of God. When you came to Christ you
[time=1629] were made a masterpiece by the master Himself. You are His best work. And you say, "Wait a minute,
[time=1636] what am I so masterfully made for? I can't sit down at the organ or the piano like Scott and
[time=1643] look up in the sky and just play anything that comes into my mind." I am not Mr. Gifted intellectually.
[time=1651] I don't run the major corporations in Fort Wayne. People aren't looking at me saying, "Now there
[time=1657] is a marvelously gifted person." I'm not the most beautiful thing that ever graced the planet.
[time=1666] What do you mean, "I'm a masterpiece?" In what dimension are you trying to tell me that I am a
[time=1674] work of art? Because when I look in the mirror, I don't see it. You are a work of art with respect
[time=1684] to your ability to invest in the lives of the people in your life. That's it. That's it. You are a
[time=1695] masterpiece created by God Himself in Christ Jesus with a capacity to make a significant
[time=1702] difference in the lives of the people you know if you're willing to do it. And He can use you
[time=1708] beyond your wildest dreams. The other thing that I wish we would understand about ourselves is that you are surrounded. You are surrounded by a bunch of people who are starving to be touched by you.
[time=1720] I mean, they are just dying for a touch from your life that is for them.
[time=1725] Let me give you some arenas, excuse me, in which to think about this.
[time=1732] You husbands, this frog may or may not go away. You husbands,
[time=1745] just let me put a right down here on the table. Are you as committed to being successful
[time=1751] in your wife's life or the life of your wife as you are at work or recreation?
[time=1765] Are you as purposeful? Are you as dedicated? Are you as premeditated? Are you as thoughtful?
[time=1773] Are you as energized? Are you as motivated to move into her life and bless the socks off that
[time=1780] woman as you are to move into the place of employment and keep your job for another day?
[time=1784] That's what it is. That's where He says, bury yourself, let yourself die, be like a grain of wheat
[time=1796] so you can bear fruit. Let me ask you why. Are you absolutely committed to the notion
[time=1806] that you are going to crown your husband's life with your loving faithfulness as Solomon said?
[time=1812] I don't know what that means in your life. I know what that means when Heidi does that to me in the ways that she pursues that in my life and I know when she's not doing it.
[time=1824] We all know how we interface with our mate but what I'm asking is is that a priority in your life to get up in the morning and say how in the world can I enhance and enrich the life of the one I've
[time=1837] pledged my life to? What about your kids? If we bring all your kids in here for those of you,
[time=1844] for those of us who have kids and we survey them and we say tell me about the energy in your dad's life, what is he really excited about? Is the kid going to say me? I'm it. I'm the apple of his eye.
[time=1860] Not because he says that but because he spends time with me because he understands me because
[time=1868] he is investing in me because he already has plans for 1993 to take me to so-and-so and do such and
[time=1875] do you understand what I'm saying? That is a principle you can live by. Let me give you a
[time=1881] real practical suggestion here. Why don't you find a piece of paper about this big and write down on it the names of the people. I mean you can't do this with all of Fort Wayne,
[time=1891] right? We've got to narrow this down. Write down the names of the people that you really believe that God has you on this planet to invest in their life. Put it right there on a piece of paper and then stick that piece of paper in the front part of your Bible. And then every Sunday
[time=1908] when you come, whether it's during a song or whether it's during that time before the service,
[time=1915] just open that and look at those names and ask yourself the question what can I do in the next
[time=1921] seven days to positively impact 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 names on this list and then do it.
[time=1931] I promise you, you'll have a great 93. Principle number two. Principle number two,
[time=1941] I just put in the front leaf of my Bible. Principle number two, assume full responsibility,
[time=1947] assume full responsibility for your ambassadorship. I know that's confusing. Come with me over to
[time=1953] 2 Corinthians 5, 2 Corinthians 5, assume full responsibility for your ambassadorship.
[time=1960] Now notice I didn't say become an ambassador. You already are an ambassador. The only question is
[time=1968] are you going to be a faithful ambassador? And I'm probably going to return to this passage in a couple of weeks when I talk about our church. But just briefly this morning, look in verse 20,
[time=1977] therefore we are ambassadors for Christ as though God were entreating through us, we beg you on
[time=1984] behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God. He's saying we are ambassadors and our job and our mission
[time=1991] is to entreat as if the living Christ were speaking in and through us to the unsaved people in our world that they would be reconciled to God. Are you going to be a faithful ambassador
[time=2003] in 1993? You say, how did I become an ambassador? Look at verses 14 and 15.
[time=2008] For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded this that one died for all, therefore all died,
[time=2015] verse 15. And he died for all, that they who live should no longer live for themselves.
[time=2022] There it is, that they who live should no longer live for themselves, but for him who died and rose
[time=2029] again on their behalf. You became an ambassador because Christ died for you and you received the
[time=2035] loving gracious forgiveness provided in his death, in his becoming like a grain of wheat that was buried and died and then bore much fruit. You're the fruit. And in response to that, what the Bible is saying is you can no longer live for yourself. Live for Christ, live as a faithful ambassador.
[time=2054] Let me talk about one arena in which you are called to be an ambassador for Christ and that's your work.
[time=2059] Most of us are going to spend five, six, seven days at work in the next seven days.
[time=2066] It's going to be a consuming thing with our time. Why are you going to go to work this week? Why are you going to go to work in 1993? Why are you going to get up in the morning, get showered, shaved, dressed, and get in the car and go to work? A lot of people are going to do
[time=2082] that because they need money. It's pretty practical. I've got a lot of bills to pay. I've got a roof to put over my head. I've got clothes to put on our back and I've got food to put on our face and that costs money. I am simply going to work because I need the money to provide for my family.
[time=2096] Other people are going to say, I'm going to work because I love my work. I mean, this is my
[time=2103] aptitude. This is what I do. I've always loved engineering. I mean, as a little kid, I was
[time=2110] destroying the radios in our house and tearing everything apart. I always did that and now I
[time=2116] get to do it for a living. I love it. I love the principles of engineering. I love my work.
[time=2121] And when I go there, I get trained and I get to explore and I get to see all these fascinating things and the mind that God has given me just permeates all the... I just love my work. Some of you are teachers and you say, I live to teach. I want to teach. I can't wait to get to the classroom and see the little light bulbs go on the kids' minds inside that classroom when I do it this way.
[time=2141] Some of you are medical doctors and you're saying, I've always been fascinated with biology and I love to help people. And when I can get in there and figure out their medicals, their problem and bring a solution, I just love that. Some of you are going to go to work for
[time=2155] money because you've got to pay for the bills. Some of you are going to go to work because it's your aptitude. It's your energy. It's your excitement. Others of you are going to go to work for a sense of identity and self-esteem. Who would I be if I don't go to work? I mean, in other words, it's my station. It's my place. It's what marks me out in this community. It's the people I circulate with. This is my identity. I'm not saying that any and all of those are necessarily
[time=2179] wrong in and of themselves, but they fall far short of the kind of principle that makes for a great 93. You want to know why God wants you to go to work? Because that is your sphere of influence
[time=2191] for the gospel of Jesus Christ. That is your mission field. Those are your people. He led you
[time=2197] to that place of work so that you could touch their lives with the gospel. Whether you have opportunity to articulate it with your mouth or live it with your life. And of course, I'm not an advocate of using work time to share the gospel, but to see that whole arena as your place,
[time=2214] your mission field, your desire and passion is to go to work and to be a godly person there and to do all those other things, but ultimately for the cause that those people will see Christ
[time=2225] through you. I promise you that I'll transform your work happens and your view about life and
[time=2232] your view about work. So some full responsibility for your ambassadorship. Let me just give you a
[time=2241] little practical thing maybe if you wanted to do this. You could just take a little piece of paper and write ambassador on it and just stick it right on your steering wheel so that every day when
[time=2254] you go to work you have to look at the word ambassador and be reminded that this is not just about money, it's not just about your aptitudes, it's not just about a sense of self-worth and being in existence in Fort Wayne. It's really all about Christ, it's really all about telling people
[time=2269] about Christ and ask him how today can I do that. Principle number three. Principle number three.
[time=2279] Make 93 the year in which you pursue genuine relationships, genuine relationships. And if you
[time=2286] would, come over to Galatians for a minute. Galatians chapter 6 verse 1. And there's a level of
[time=2295] involvement that's described in these verses that is so appealing to me and at the same time so threatening to me. There's something in these verses that I want desperately but I'm scared to death to have. Galatians chapter 6 verse 1. Brother and even if a man is caught in any trespass,
[time=2313] you who are spiritual, restore such a one who in a spirit of gentleness, each one looking to
[time=2319] yourself lest you two be tempted. Verse 2. Bear one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law
[time=2326] of Christ. For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself. You know
[time=2332] what you hear in that passage? You hear people being involved at a level of real genuine contact
[time=2342] where the rubber is really meeting the road in their life, where sin is becoming apparent. And I don't think it has to be some major top 10 thing. I think
[time=2356] anything there. You remember this word restore? It's used in the New Testament of restoring nets or mending nets. The fishermen on the Sea of Galilee and they throw the nets out and they get ripped. Something would rip the net and the net becomes useless. And so the word restore, they would sit in their boat and they would use their little tools and they would restore that net and make it viable again, make it usable again. This is describing a level of intimacy,
[time=2379] a level of genuine trust in relationship that allows that kind of involvement to go on on a
[time=2385] regular basis. Where I let you see me for who I am, I let you know, I let you on the inside,
[time=2395] you see the weaknesses, you see the failure, you see the struggle which puts you in a position
[time=2402] to then mend me. So many of us are like this, some of your, you would call your very best friends.
[time=2415] And the only place at which they really get to intersect in your life is to give much needed sympathy at points of trial. But as far as letting them in to know and to trust
[time=2425] them with your frailty and your weakness. No, that's a lonely way to live. That's a lonely,
[time=2437] that's not the way God meant for it to be. Bear one another's burdens, what burdens?
[time=2441] Doesn't it not? In this passage we're not talking about financial burdens and in this passage we're not talking about the burden of being physically sick. In this passage we're talking about the burden of having stepped off the path of obedience. One of the great concerns I had when moving to
[time=2458] this city was leaving behind the four or five people that were at this level in my life.
[time=2466] Knowing that I was going to walk away from those men who were on the inside and who did really know
[time=2473] me. I mean they knew me. My weaknesses and my failures and my sin and my struggles.
[time=2479] And I was afraid for that because I didn't want to come here and be isolated and then be caught
[time=2485] in some major way by my weaknesses and let them really hurt people.
[time=2488] And it was traumatic to think about opening that up again to other people.
[time=2497] But I just want to stand as an encourager and as an example in some sense. To say that in the last
[time=2504] 18 months God has been gracious and there are now three or four men again in my life that 18 months ago I didn't even know who can ask me any question about my life they want to ask.
[time=2515] Any dimension of my life they have freedom to have. And short of their questions I will give them
[time=2523] the vital information on Russell Moore. Why? Because I need their help. That's what
[time=2531] the Bible is all about. That's what becoming a Christian is all about. It's not being isolated and alone. It's being encouraged and held up and lifted up and carried by other believers.
[time=2542] Because I want to do that in their life. I want to be that to them.
[time=2553] To be real practical let me just give you a suggestion. I would ask you to look across the landscape of your life. The people that you know in this church or in this city they may not even go to this church but they're Christians. And identify one or two or three. And say these are
[time=2570] the people of all the people that I know even though this is a very scary thought. These are the people that I think I could trust. Not to become gossips with my weakness. Not to beat me up with
[time=2581] my failures but to listen and to love me and to confront me and to help me.
[time=2586] I would challenge you this morning to identify those three or four names.
[time=2591] And maybe in the next week or two grab a lunch with them and say you know what?
[time=2599] I think we could do some things here that might really be strengthening and encouraging.
[time=2608] And see where that takes you. Number four, principle number four.
[time=2614] I just want to call this one a positive attitude. Let's see it over here in Philippians 4 for a
[time=2622] minute. Philippians chapter 4. Philippians chapter 4 verse 8. Finally, brother, whatever is true,
[time=2632] you know this verse. Whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence, if anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things. What he's saying is man, put your focus on what's good in life.
[time=2647] Set your heart and your mind and your attention on the honorable things, the good things, the right
[time=2653] things, the pure things, the lovely things. It's like two people standing on the edge of a meadow.
[time=2659] And the one person's got this verse in their life and so they see the beautiful trees and
[time=2665] they see the breeze running down across the prairie or the meadow itself and the things
[time=2671] are waving back and forth and the breeze and the cows are there and the stream is running over there and they're just alive with the beauty of the meadow and they're just soaking it in.
[time=2681] And the other person is standing next to them, they don't see all that stuff. All they see is the manure in the meadow. All they can focus on are these cow pies that are all over the meadow and
[time=2692] all there's one over there and oh there's another one over there and oh there's another oh and I stepped in there when right there. You know this is just horrible, this is a horrible meadow.
[time=2701] We eat a different meadow. Let's find another meadow. Well guess what, there aren't any meadows
[time=2708] without that stuff in them. So make up your mind. You're going to look at that stuff or you're going to look at the good stuff. Now I'm not promoting denial, I'm not promoting just closing your
[time=2719] eyes of the hard parts of life. The word of God calls you to embrace reality but what this verse is also saying while you embrace the difficult parts of your life, look in them and through them and around them for what is honorable and right and pure and lovely and good.
[time=2733] Things that are excellent and worthy of praise.
[time=2736] I mean there's just no perfect place. There's no perfect church. There's no perfect
[time=2744] except the one I'm married wife. There's no perfect kids except for my four going on five.
[time=2750] I mean you just can't have all, I already have all that stuff so you have to live with.
[time=2754] You understand what I'm saying? There is no perfect reality. So make a choice inside of reality to focus on what is right and good. Grab a hold of what is right.
[time=2764] Let me go a step further with that. You know in 1993 some of us are going to lose our jobs,
[time=2772] some of us are going to lose our health, some of us are going to die, some of our loved ones are
[time=2778] going to become infected with cancer, some of us are going to go financially upside down.
[time=2787] You know that right? The Bible almost guarantees that stuff and James won it says
[time=2793] when you consider or when you encounter various trials. He didn't say if, it says when you encounter
[time=2802] them. It's a given and what I want to ask you to do this morning is to purpose in your heart
[time=2809] right now that whatever those trials are going to be that God's going to allow to come into your life. You've already made up your mind today that in 1993 when that trial walks and knocks on my front door I'm going to open it, stick my hand out and say hi. Welcome. Been waiting for you.
[time=2826] Come on in. Stay as long as you need to stay because I know why you're here.
[time=2832] You're a gift of God and you're going to make my life something better for the cause of Christ.
[time=2838] Welcome. The trial is a friend and let it transform you for the cause of Christ.
[time=2848] Well, lastly this morning, number five, I really like this principle.
[time=2854] I just wrote down a hundred percent, a hundred and then a percent sign. A hundred percent. Go back
[time=2862] a page in Philippians, the Philippians 3. There's a little glimpse of a guy that's going a hundred
[time=2871] percent. He's kind of short, he has a hook nose, bad eyes, he's ugly, he's been beaten up,
[time=2878] he's scarred. He's really not sure if he's been a success in life at all, but he's going a hundred percent. Philippians 3.13, brethren, I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet,
[time=2890] but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press
[time=2897] on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Here is a guy that has
[time=2903] the pedal to the metal. He has pulled out the stops. He is sick and tired of a mediocre life.
[time=2909] He doesn't want to just get by. He doesn't want to just do enough to get by. The guy is saying, look, this is my only life. I'm going to live it absolutely to the max. When it's time to work,
[time=2921] work a hundred percent. When it's time to play, play a hundred percent. When it's time to come in here and worship God, worship God a hundred percent. When it's time to sing songs in this place, sing songs a hundred percent. When it's time to do your ministry in a wana on a Wednesday night, do it a hundred percent. When it's time to be with your wife, be a hundred percent with your wife.
[time=2939] You understand what I'm saying? Just do it. Be where you are and do it with all you've got.
[time=2946] Pull the stops out. Let go of yourself and your life. I had so much fun at the Masters
[time=2953] College just week telling them, talking to them a little bit about this principle, and I used our church as an example. I said, talking about going a hundred percent, I said,
[time=2963] you know, 16 years ago somebody had an idea as a way to get people into our church and to tell
[time=2971] them about Christ, and their idea was a living Christmas tree. Now you understand what that says,
[time=2979] but they don't. They kind of chuckled. When you think about it, it's kind of funny. A living,
[time=2985] I said the first year I understand it didn't like wrap around. It was just this flat thing
[time=2991] that kind of sat out there and they cut holes in it and people popped their heads through in St. Christmas girls. And the kids are just laughing at this. They just think this is hilarious because they're picturing it. You know, they're thinking this is stupid. This is not a good idea. What a stupid idea. But then I went on to tell them, I said it got better every year. And this year
[time=3014] it's not a flat facade. I told them about the 10,000 pounds of steel that's been specially
[time=3022] designed by people in this church. It's an original. Nowhere else. To hold our 165 choir members up.
[time=3034] And I told them about Ron Hackett and how he spends three months of his life putting up and
[time=3043] tearing down all the storefronts with those who are willing to help him. And I told them about the
[time=3049] guys who work up in the booth and string the five miles of electrical wiring that run its way
[time=3055] in and around and through the living Christmas tree to hook itself up to 3,200 light bulbs that
[time=3061] are run by those three computers that sit up there and make it all happen at the right time.
[time=3065] I told them about Ken Norr and his willingness to take his aptitude and his place of work and
[time=3071] apply it to that steel frame and that steel structure and the guys that come in here and set that
[time=3077] thing up and get it out of this church without ripping up our sanctuary. I told them about all the ladies that come in and cover the facade and put on all the needles and the packages. I told them about all the choir members who go for a whole Saturday and a Friday night to make sure they're running their music and then week after week after week after week after week from months memorize reams and reams and reams of words. I told them about this funny little guy named Pastor Peter
[time=3103] Kobe who just won't settle for anything less than the best. And then I told them when we opened the
[time=3115] doors to give away our tickets one cold brisk freezing morning there was a line of people that
[time=3126] started from the front of our church went all the way down the side and around the corner and within three hours we'd given away 22,000 tickets and they went wow. I said you want to know why the
[time=3144] living Christmas tree works because there are a whole bunch of people in this church that are
[time=3150] giving themselves completely and totally to the living Christmas tree when it's time to do Christmas tree we do Christmas tree and they got excited about that they got excited about dreaming and
[time=3162] thinking maybe I could be the next kin nor maybe I could be the next Ron Hackett maybe I could be
[time=3168] the next Peter maybe I could do that with my maybe that could happen to me if I'm willing to give
[time=3175] myself a hundred percent I believe it can I believe it can happen to them and I believe it can happen
[time=3183] to you. For every one of you there is capacity in your life to serve God and do incredible things
[time=3192] if you'll just throw yourself at it and let him take care of the results amen amen.
[time=3197] I went on to tell him about the living Christmas tree about a lady that called our church she'd
[time=3205] been to a living Christmas tree and she's dying of cancer and she called our church didn't come
[time=3213] here just called our church because of the living Christmas tree she'd been living Christmas tree she needed help she called our church she said I'm dying of cancer could somebody come talk to me please about how to get saved and so we sent our I told him I said we spent we sent our evangelistic
[time=3228] Rambo Angie White over to I said this woman can lead anybody and anything to Christ I said if she
[time=3236] could just get demons to materialize she could lead them to Christ which I think may be true and her
[time=3242] husband and another person and how when they arrived at the front door of this lady's house she was
[time=3249] so overwhelmed with joy that someone from our church had come and she got her husband to sit down and then just as they were going to start talking the lady with the cancer said just a minute just a minute I got to go she ran out the door over to her next door neighbor and drug her next door neighbor over because she felt that her next door neighbor really needed to hear what was going to happen and so for the next three and a half hours our EE team our ED team shared the gospel three and
[time=3273] a half hours at the end of that time every single one of those people prayed to receive Christ
[time=3279] I'll tell you what you can take an idea like the living Christmas tree you put the flesh and
[time=3285] bones of people who care and people who won't settle for second best and who are saying I'm going to do this for all I'm worth and great great great things can happen let's pray together
[time=3297] Father as I look to 1993 in my own life and as I look at the hearts and souls and lives of these
[time=3305] I've grown to love and these faithful folks a part of our church a part of our family I asked Lord that you would bring these principles and others from your word to life
[time=3316] help us to be principled people people who are directed by the power of of truth help us to rise
[time=3325] above thinking about a kind of life that we think will satisfy us that we think will make us whole
[time=3333] that we think will fill up the emptiness for we would become like the grain of wheat that never dies but just lays there and is by itself alone instead help us to throw ourselves at life
[time=3348] recklessly abandonly and abandonment giving our lives away Father help us to pursue genuine relationships with the passion help us to risk the vulnerability
[time=3360] and the and the sense of being known for the sake of others who would carry our burdens
[time=3366] Father help us to have attitudes that are positive help us to choose to see what is
[time=3372] right and honorable and good about our lives about this church about our place of employment and Father help us to pursue excellence in everything we do help us to be hundred percent
