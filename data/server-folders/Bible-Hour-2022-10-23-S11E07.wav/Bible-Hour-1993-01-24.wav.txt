[time=359] I will not feel.
[time=389] [AMEN]
[time=395] Let's take our Bibles this morning and begin our discussion of this topic of abortion by turning to Psalm 139.
[time=404] Psalm 139 verses 13 to 16.
[time=407] It's Psalm written by David.
[time=410] Psalm 139.
[time=416] For that it's formed my inward parts.
[time=420] That it's weaved me in my mother's womb.
[time=424] I will give thanks to thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[time=428] Wonderful are thy works, and my soul knows it very well.
[time=432] My frame was not hidden from thee when I was made in secret and skillfully wrought in the depths of the earth.
[time=439] Now in eyes have seen my unformed substance, and in thy book they were all written.
[time=444] The days that were ordained for me when as yet there was not one of them.
[time=450] As we begin this morning I want to make a few introductory remarks.
[time=454] The first is this.
[time=457] This morning's message is not meant to be a political speech.
[time=461] It is not meant to support the Republicans, or to support the Democrats, or vice versa.
[time=467] This of course is a topic that is embroiled its way into political life, but it is nevertheless an issue of life and death, and so will speak to it from God's word.
[time=476] But don't misunderstand anything I say this morning as to support or to decry any political movement or way or thought.
[time=484] It's my covenant never to use this platform for political purposes, but always to use it to clarify the heart and mind of God.
[time=491] And wherever that reflects on political issues there it reflects.
[time=495] Secondly I want you to know that I have no intention this morning of saying something gory, or something unseemly for a setting such as this.
[time=504] Something that would shock our sensibilities about the horrors of what actually go on in abortion.
[time=509] That's not my intent.
[time=510] If you have not been exposed to that it is wise for you to be exposed to that.
[time=514] There are a number of good films and booklets and books that you can read that will show you what actually takes place in an actual abortion, but this is not the time of the place to cover that kind of information.
[time=524] Thirdly, in an audience this size there may surely be one or two or ten or fifteen or more, even if there is just one woman who has had an abortion.
[time=539] And at the outset this morning I want you to know that this message is not at you, directed at you, to make you feel guilty.
[time=548] That would be the last thing on earth that I would want to do to you. Some of the things that are said may produce a twinge of guilt or remembrance that you're working hard to forget.
[time=559] And you're trying to experience the forgiveness of God and I want that for you.
[time=564] And so while we move into this territory be aware that I'm aware that my heart of compassion extends to you who have gone through this.
[time=573] And I will say what I say in truthfulness to the word of God, but without any sense of judgment or to inflict emotional pain on you.
[time=583] I want to talk this morning around three different questions that I'll pose and then attempt to answer.
[time=587] The first is this, what does America say about abortion? What does America say about abortion?
[time=596] Knowing that I would be talking about this this week, I took Thursday morning to go down into the main part of the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=603] And early in the morning about 730 with a friend walk around the corner and come upon the place where the abortions are performed in the city, at the abortion clinic.
[time=613] And my eyes and my heart and my emotions took in several different things.
[time=617] At first I saw the building itself which seemed rather dark and all the shades were pulled and there was light behind the windows.
[time=623] The evidence that something was going on but there was obvious no way that I would want to or be able to see what was actually going on inside that eerie place.
[time=632] Right outside of it on its porch by invitation of those who run the clinic are those who are in support of abortion.
[time=638] Probably 10 or 15 people were standing there huddled up with gloves on their hands and umbrellas in their hands as well because of the rain and the cold morning hours were there to provide some sense of comfort or at least counterbalance to the other group that was there.
[time=652] And they were forced to stand on the other side of the street by city ordinance.
[time=656] They were not allowed to be on the same side of the street.
[time=658] They were the pastors and the other Christians who had come as they regularly do every Thursday morning to pray for the people who were arriving at the abortion clinic and for the babies that would be aborted in those next hours.
[time=673] And as I met these people and talked with them I found them to be full of compassion, very well aware of the laws that constrained their behavior and fully intending to live within those.
[time=684] I was thankful for that.
[time=686] But I also noticed right in the middle of the street running across the street and then to the sidewalk on the other side of the street, the sidewalk on the side of the street of the abortion clinic.
[time=696] There was a yellow line.
[time=697] It looked like it was painted by the city itself.
[time=699] It was that same type of road yellow paint.
[time=701] And it really dissected the door of entrance.
[time=704] And I learned that the city allowed for one trained pro-life counselor to stand on the north side of that line and one pro-life trained counselor to stand on the right side of that line.
[time=715] And that was the only contact that could be made with people coming to seek the services of this clinic.
[time=722] And they had with them literature which I then received.
[time=725] They came across the street and I was able to ask them a few questions about their training and their hard and their compassion and what they were handing out and I received that.
[time=735] But what struck me most about my 45 minutes or an hour outside of that clinic were the people who drove up.
[time=743] The people who approached the clinic.
[time=745] One scene that is vividly in my mind was that of three high school girls.
[time=750] They seem to be walking almost militantly in line, one in front, one behind.
[time=754] And it seemed as if the one in the middle was the one being protected from this whole experience.
[time=759] They walked with their heads up and with a proud look in their face and right down the sidewalk and then into the door of the abortion clinic and then there are stairs that immediately they ascend and disappear.
[time=770] And I thought my land.
[time=771] There was a bold arrogance to their behavior.
[time=775] And then there came a car that stopped on the street in front of the clinic.
[time=781] And as I looked in the car it appeared that there was a husband and a wife.
[time=786] And the lady got out of the car, was greeted by one of these counselors and the counselor attempted to handle the information.
[time=793] I'm not sure if she took it or not.
[time=795] Then the lady went through the supporters of abortion, through the door, up the stairs and disappeared in the car, drove on down the street.
[time=804] And then there was another car that approached and it appeared to me to be a father and a teenage girl, appeared to be a daughter.
[time=813] The car did the exact same thing, pulled up, stopped, the door opened, the gal got out, the counselor handed her the information, the girl went in the door upstairs, disappeared and the car drove down the street.
[time=824] And I thought to myself, what in the world has happened to America?
[time=829] What brought us to this place?
[time=832] What brought us as a society to the place that that kind of thing occurs in a city like ours every Thursday morning?
[time=841] And I want to track that with you this morning.
[time=843] Under the topic or the question what does America say about abortion?
[time=847] Let's begin with the 60s and the ground swell of support for abortion.
[time=852] It was back in the 60s when we threw off the shackles of the Judeo-Christian ethic as a country.
[time=857] It was almost as if somebody lit a little spark somewhere and had just caught fire on the brush of America and ran through the mountains and through the prairies and all the way to the coast to coast.
[time=867] America embraced free love.
[time=869] America said we don't want anybody telling us that sex outside of marriage is wrong and we're going to demonstrate and we're going to have all kinds of huge concerts and build musicians and movies.
[time=880] And the whole thing to establish this one very clear fact, we are going to have sex with anybody we want to at any time.
[time=888] And we will not suffer the consequences of that through pregnancy.
[time=892] That is unacceptable to us.
[time=895] And what I guess I want to say here is this, abortion is not being pushed on us by some few people, some small interest group, some limited group of activists.
[time=907] Abortion finds its support and its strength in the people of America who have said we reject God and we will live any way we want to live.
[time=919] Support for abortion also built in the early 60s through this phenomena called eugenic abortions.
[time=926] Birth enhancing drug came on the scene by the name of tholomid, T-H-O-L-A-M-I-D and it was a birth enhancing drug but it had a horrible side effect to produce children who were limbless.
[time=937] And doctors in England under the effort to protect their society from being burdened with these limbless children and the parents themselves who didn't want these limbless children said we need to have eugenic abortions.
[time=950] We need to abort everybody who isn't healthy.
[time=954] And that added to all the rhetoric.
[time=956] Thirdly came the feminist movement which has been an enormous support of abortion, its strongest advocates.
[time=965] And they say something along these lines.
[time=967] We women are unwilling to be victimized by men as men can jump in and out of bed with anyone they want to and walk away without any consequences.
[time=977] But the women get pregnant.
[time=979] The man's freedom had no impingement, it had no consequences, it had no detrimental results.
[time=985] But the woman's freedom does, we get pregnant.
[time=989] And so for her to be truly genuinely free, they have wanted to eliminate all the consequences that they can, namely pregnancy.
[time=999] And if you read any of their arguments and if you can remember the way it all began, you will know that they said very much those kinds of words, that was their militant attitude which exists even to this day.
[time=1010] They add to that not just the consequences of pregnancy with respect to free love, but the women want to be able to put on their suits and go to work and compete with men in the man's environment and they simply cannot do that if they have child bearing responsibilities.
[time=1024] And so the two combined requires that abortion exists.
[time=1027] In the words of one leading feminist I quote, women are not equal to men unless they are rid of child bearing responsibilities.
[time=1034] Am I saying that it's wrong to go to work as a woman? No. I'm talking about the foundation for a society that condones, supports, legalizes and practices abortion.
[time=1047] Then fourthly in the early 60s there came this notion of a population explosion.
[time=1053] Scientists were writing their calculations that if we continue to grow at this current rate we would be standing on top of each other.
[time=1059] We would crush each other out of existence. We were growing too fast. There wouldn't be room. There wouldn't be space for the rest of us to live so the need for abortion.
[time=1070] By 1969 the November Gallup Poll showed 40% of adults in America backing legislation to permit abortion in the first three months of pregnancy.
[time=1086] In that same year 1969 modern medicine, the magazine Modern Medicine reported that the majority of US doctors said abortion should be legalized.
[time=1097] So the groundswell for abortion. But that had to take a form, that had to take a legalized form, that had to be pushed through the laws of our land.
[time=1104] So in 1970 Hawaii was the first state to legalize abortion. And in that same year Alaska's governor signed into effect or supported a bill which said that abortion should be permitted without any restrictions at all.
[time=1115] Then the American Medical Association's House of Delegates voted for the first time to allow doctors to perform abortions for social and economic reasons, otherwise known as elective abortions, abortions that are performed for non-medical mandated reasons.
[time=1131] And then the Pentagon took a huge step, the powerful United States government wielding its strength by ordering all US military-based hospitals around the world to provide abortions for all personal and dependence, for all personnel and dependence regardless of state and local laws.
[time=1149] So at that time though the state law may have prohibited abortion, that military base in that state said you have to give it to the personnel.
[time=1161] 1972, the American Bar Association endorsed a uniform law to permit abortion on demand. And there are lawyers gave their sign of approval.
[time=1173] Also in that year, though not affecting immediately the legislation, but interesting as a footnote, the United Methodist Church General Conference recommended abortion be removed from its criminal code.
[time=1182] The United Presbyterian Church General Assembly reaffirmed its position that the decision on abortion is entirely up to the woman.
[time=1189] And finally by the summer of 1972, another Gallup poll reported that 60% of Americans believe that a decision to have an abortion should be left solely to the woman and her doctor without any reference to the development of the fetus, 60% of America.
[time=1208] All of that led the way for the great historic decision of Roe v. Wade, great only in the sense of the catastrophe it represents, January 26, 1973, which excluded unborn children from the 14th Amendment than the protection provided they're in, no person shall be deprived of life without due process.
[time=1225] And of all the nations in the world, there is no nation on the face of the earth with a more permissive abortion policy than the United States of America with the single exception of China.
[time=1239] So the ground swell beginning in the early 60s, the legalization process culminating in the early 70s and now the practice of abortion in America. Nearly 2 million babies are aborted every year in America.
[time=1251] Every third baby being conceived is being aborted. Every third baby being conceived is being aborted.
[time=1260] Among teenage women, there are 736 abortions for every 1000 births. Among married women, among married women, abortions now exceed births.
[time=1279] This country has transformed abortion into a multi-billion dollar industry, generating massive revenues not just from the abortion itself but from the sale of fetal material.
[time=1290] It's a booming business. And now in the 20th year of the aftermath of Roe v. Wade, our nation has aborted some 25 to 30 million babies.
[time=1302] And how do we justify that? How do we soothe our conscience? How does this nation deal with that? What terminology do they use?
[time=1312] What is the euphemism of abortion? Pro-choice. Pro-choice. It's not called selfishness. It's not called removing ourselves from the consequences of unrestrained immorality.
[time=1325] It's not called hedonism. It's not called decadence. And it's certainly not called murder. It's called pro-choice.
[time=1333] The abortion movement began under the title of pro-abortion. But soon after it began, the media gave it another title, pro-choice.
[time=1341] And it is the leading banner of the movement. People who support abortion are called pro-choice activists and they are supporting women's rights.
[time=1351] And as of last Wednesday at 12 noon, we now have a man who occupies the Oval Office who has said, and I quote, "I will guarantee a woman's right to choose."
[time=1362] Those are his words. "I will guarantee a woman's right to choose." The euphemism. Pro-choice.
[time=1371] So fueled by the sexual revolution, eugenic abortions, feminist movement, and the concern of some alleged population explosion, America has moved itself to a position that both by law and practice to a form of mass murder that masquerades under the euphemism of pro-choice.
[time=1389] Well, if that's what America says about abortion, my second question this morning is this. What does abortion say about America?
[time=1397] What does abortion say about America? John Pilke, a good friend of mine, professor in the English Literature Department of the Masters College, wrote this.
[time=1405] The phrase pro-choice strikes me as one of the most depraved, apocalyptically wicked, rhetorical facts, and the history of Western civilization in the Christian era.
[time=1416] The phrase means pro-sin, or free to choose sin. The phrase would be actually less dreadful if it were pro-abortion because that would confine it to the sphere of a particular moral problem.
[time=1429] But by turning it to what seems a euphemism, the pro-choice people run the final rhetorical death knell to the entire democratic experience.
[time=1438] The phrase pro-choice means without conscience, or without inhibition, or without restraint, and it parades itself under the Jeffersonian banner of liberty of conscience and separation of church and state.
[time=1448] As a rhetorical gesture, perfectly designed to function as a political banner, this phrase constitutes the last word, the official formulation of official apostate defiance against the God of Christianity.
[time=1462] He says, "I am confident that God will answer apocalyptically." That sounds too true.
[time=1471] It is, in effect, the official formulation of the official apostate defiance against God because we are now saying as a society that we will determine who lives and who dies.
[time=1483] It is the ultimate issue of life and death, and we have said, "God, that is no longer your decision, it is ours." And we will exercise it at our convenience under the banner of pro-choice.
[time=1495] Let's go down to the word of God and further understand what abortion says about America, and we'll settle for a little while in the book of Genesis.
[time=1502] So if you would, Genesis chapter 21, I find it very interesting that the whole argument against abortion can be settled in the first book of the Bible.
[time=1514] It's not like we needed the rest of the 35 of them to complete the picture.
[time=1520] Genesis chapter 21, talking about Sarah and Abraham, and the first thing I want to say that the Bible says is conception is an act of God.
[time=1532] Conception is an act of God.
[time=1536] Genesis chapter 21 verses 1 and 2. Then the Lord took note of Sarah, as he had said, and the Lord did for Sarah as he had promised. Remember Sarah had been barren.
[time=1547] For all her life she had been barren.
[time=1550] Verse 2, "So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, and at the appointed time which God had spoken to him."
[time=1559] Go a few chapters back into Genesis chapter 25 verse 21. Genesis 25 verse 21. The same truth is given to us.
[time=1569] 25 21, "And Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife because she was barren, and the Lord answered him and Rebecca his wife conceived."
[time=1579] It was an act of God. God moved her from a condition of barrenness to conceiving. The same could be said of Ruth.
[time=1585] If you want to look that up later, Ruth chapter 4 verse 11, "Her conception was an act of God."
[time=1591] The same is true of Hannah, who had been barren all of her life in 1 Samuel 1 verses 19 and 20. Her conception was an act of God.
[time=1599] People conceive because God is active in that process.
[time=1603] You say, "No, no, no. The human makes the baby. The two people get together and they make a human life." No, not true. Not really. They are the human instruments of the human parts of that life, but only God can make a soul.
[time=1614] Only God can give a soul life to an individual. That is done by a sovereign act of God.
[time=1620] Let me show it to you negatively. Genesis chapter 20, go back a few pages. Genesis chapter 20 verse 18.
[time=1627] And we'll deal with the issue of barrenness.
[time=1632] Genesis 20 verse 18.
[time=1638] It says, "Therefore the Lord had closed fast all the wombs of the household of Abemilek because of Sarah, Abraham's wife."
[time=1646] He'd shut everybody's wombs. They couldn't conceive. Why? Because he said, "No." In other words, if God doesn't say, "Yes, there is no conception." Genesis chapter 16 verse 2.
[time=1658] This is Sarah again, and Abraham in her barren state. Now behold, the Lord has prevented me from bearing children.
[time=1668] The same could be said of Hannah in 1 Samuel 1, 5. What's the point?
[time=1673] The point of these passages is this. It illustrates that God is the power behind barrenness and God is the power behind conception.
[time=1682] Whenever there is a conception, God has made it happen.
[time=1688] Let me say it to you another way. No conception has ever occurred or ever will occur anywhere on the face of the earth and all of human history that is not a result of God's creative purpose.
[time=1697] That means all those little babies down in Africa, all those little babies over in India, all those little babies over in China, all the little babies in Europe, all the little babies in America,
[time=1706] everywhere, every time one of those is conceived, it is a part of the pro-creative, creative power of God.
[time=1713] He does that. Conception is an act of God. Point number 2. Life begins at conception. Life begins at conception.
[time=1723] Psalm 2210, let me read it to you, David again. "Thou hast been my God from my womb."
[time=1731] Isaiah 49 says this, "The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother, he made me."
[time=1741] Jeremiah says this, chapter 1, verse 5, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, and before you were born, I consecrated you, and have appointed you a prophet to the nations."
[time=1752] You know what this is saying? That God is having relationship with an unborn baby. He is naming the baby, he is commissioning the baby, and we find out in the New Testament that John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit while in his mother's womb.
[time=1769] It's undeniable. The Word of God couldn't be any clearer. Luke 1, 15 is the reference on that, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit while yet in his mother's womb.
[time=1779] Paul adds to the argument in Galatians 1, 15, "But when he who had set me apart even from my mother's womb and called me through his grace was pleased to reveal his son and me."
[time=1791] Paul was known by God and commissioned by God while yet in his mother's womb to his ministry as an apostle.
[time=1798] David knew it, Isaiah knew it, Jeremiah knew it, the physician Luke knew it about John the Baptist, Paul knows it.
[time=1806] God is identifying human life and human personality and human purpose and human course while that child is in the womb.
[time=1814] There is a continuity of life. Let me put it to you this way. There is a continuity of life that exists to the child at conception, to the child at birth.
[time=1823] That's nowhere started or stopped. It is a human life.
[time=1830] In the words of a great theologian, R.C. Sproul, who got really practical in this particular point, he said this, "If it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck, it's probably a duck."
[time=1842] He went on to say this, "The fetus looks like a living human person. It acts like a human person.
[time=1848] The embryo has the genetic structure of a human person. It has the vital signs of a living human person.
[time=1853] The fetus has sexuality and movement. With this accumulative evidence from natural science it would seemingly require powerful evidence to the contrary to conclude that a prenatal baby is not a living human person.
[time=1865] If it looks like a duck, it walks like a duck, it quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck."
[time=1872] Point number three, Genesis chapter 1.
[time=1877] Genesis chapter 1 verses 25 and 26.
[time=1884] This is a wonderful truth that most of our society has failed to notice.
[time=1891] Genesis 1 verses 25 and 26 says this, "And God made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and the cattle after their kind, and everything that creeps on the ground after its kind, and God saw that it was good."
[time=1905] Now verse 26, "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the sky, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.'"
[time=1920] There are two different things going on here. God is creating the animal world, and that's created after its kind, and then God created man.
[time=1930] And he didn't create it after its kind, or the animal kind, he created it after his own kind, in the very image of God.
[time=1939] What is created inside that womb is not an animal, it's not a biological sequence, it's not just a collection of cells, it's not fetal matter, it's not just human tissue,
[time=1949] because it has been created in the image of God, it is a relational, volitional, emotional, human being with relational capacity.
[time=1957] That's what it means to be created in the image of God.
[time=1961] And because of that, it is life for life. Genesis 9, 6 says this, "Whoever sheds man's blood, whoever sheds man's blood, by man his blood shall be shed."
[time=1972] Capital punishment, why? Because it's some great affront to humanity, because you've killed a human being, because that human is just flesh, no.
[time=1982] The verse goes on, "For in the image of God, man was made."
[time=1989] The problem with killing another human being is not an affront against human flesh, it's that you are making an affront against the image of God in that human being.
[time=1997] And so God institutes capital punishment.
[time=2001] And herein is the whole argument of the sanctity of life.
[time=2004] We are being fed by our media doctrine of the quality of life.
[time=2009] A person doesn't have a right to live simply because he is a human made in the image of God, he has to earn that right to life by meeting some vague criteria.
[time=2019] Some genetic worthiness, somehow that child has to be wanted or accepted by society, somehow that child has to be wanted or accepted by its mother.
[time=2028] If it doesn't meet these criteria, it has no, it's not worthy of life.
[time=2034] And we are at that point thrown into the same thought patterns as Hitler and the Nazi death camps who wiped out the Jews because they were not a sufficient quality of life.
[time=2046] They were an unwanted genetic strain as are these unwanted babies, so the argument goes.
[time=2053] And I would suggest to you this, if the criteria can be imposed at the beginning of life, it will eventually be opposed at any time in life.
[time=2062] In other words, a person who fails to meet some arbitrary standard of the quality of life may lose their life as soon as society says you don't measure up.
[time=2070] And we are already hearing of that, all the time with elderly people.
[time=2075] And the pressure for that will only increase as our social security system is absolutely bankrupt and unable to pay for them.
[time=2083] The temptation for this nation is to just take the very next small step and when they reach a certain level of debilitation, wipe them out.
[time=2091] The arguments are already in place.
[time=2095] Number four, it's a very simple thing. It's a very simple truth on the Word of God.
[time=2100] It happens to be the very truth that the nation of Israel rested upon to say no abortions in contrast to their pagan society who were performing abortions.
[time=2108] It is also the main argument that the early church used as it stood up against Plato and Aristotle, both of whom purported abortions for family contraception.
[time=2122] It's this, love your neighbor.
[time=2125] That was the great argument of Israel and that was the great argument of the early church, love your neighbor.
[time=2129] They both respected the sanctity of life, they both recognized that in the womb there was a living human being and that living human being was our neighbor and we had to love it.
[time=2139] And even in the writing of the early church, it's a book called The Dittake.
[time=2143] It was the early writings that were kind of codified, says this, "Thou shalt not murder a child by abortion."
[time=2149] That's the early church position on abortion, called it murder, said you can't do it.
[time=2153] And when you add to this the affectionate heart of God towards the needy and the helpless that we could trace in Scripture but don't have time this morning,
[time=2161] God has a heart of compassion for the needy and the helpless, those who cannot defend themselves.
[time=2166] So love your neighbor.
[time=2168] And one last point, as far as the Word of God on this issue, come with me to Romans chapter 1.
[time=2174] Romans chapter 1.
[time=2180] And this really exposes America.
[time=2183] This is really what abortion says about America.
[time=2186] It's just undeniable truth.
[time=2189] It begins chapter 1 verse 18 with the wrath of God.
[time=2193] It says there the wrath of God has revealed from heaven and I'm going to come back to that in a minute.
[time=2198] But start with me now in verse 21.
[time=2202] This is step 1, "For even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God." There was a time when this country knew God.
[time=2209] There was a time when this country honored God as God.
[time=2214] But when we bought hook, line, and sinker into the theory of evolution and threw God out of our classrooms by prohibiting prayer
[time=2222] and began to teach this theory of evolution as fact, we in effect said God is dead.
[time=2228] And he is irrelevant to the American society.
[time=2232] That was step 1.
[time=2233] This passage reveals a progression of degeneration.
[time=2237] Romans 1 reveals the sinking of a society into the moral morass, the lowest point of revealed biblical truth
[time=2246] that any society could ever reach or plummet to.
[time=2250] It begins by rejecting God.
[time=2252] Secondly, look at verse 25.
[time=2256] "For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the creator who is blessed forever on men."
[time=2264] Let your eyes go up to verse 23.
[time=2267] It's not just the creature, it's the creation.
[time=2270] "And exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man and of birds and of four-footed animals and crawling creatures."
[time=2278] Step 1 is to say there is no God, we did that with evolution.
[time=2281] Step 2 is to say we worship now the creation and the creatures in the creation over God and those who are created in His image.
[time=2289] Sound familiar?
[time=2292] We are more committed to the animals of this country than we are the unborn babies of this country.
[time=2299] The next step that a society takes in its downward movement is found in verse 26.
[time=2307] God gives them over to degrading passions, that's homosexuality.
[time=2311] For their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural.
[time=2314] In the same way also men abandoned the natural function of the women and burned in their desire towards one another.
[time=2320] Men with men committing in decent acts and receiving in their own persons the dupe penalty of their heir.
[time=2327] Here we are again.
[time=2328] It's like we're reading the biography of America since 1960.
[time=2333] We reject God, we elevate the creation and the creature.
[time=2337] God gives us over now to homosexuality which as you know is the hot topic in America today.
[time=2344] It's the next frontier for those who would move us along this little walk of depravity.
[time=2351] And the whole thing hits the bottom of the bucket in verse 32.
[time=2356] It's called the depraved mind. Although they know the ordinance of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death
[time=2364] they not only do the same but also give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[time=2371] It's a mind without a mind. It's a mind that has no justice.
[time=2374] It's a mind that can't make up its mind what is right and what is wrong.
[time=2378] In immediate connection to the abortion issue let me give you a few examples of the depraved mind of America.
[time=2384] The IRS has recently ruled in revised rule number 73-something that parents are entitled to a tax deduction
[time=2395] if the baby they tried to abort lives for any length of period after the abortion.
[time=2403] In other words the baby is not a human being if it dies instantly or if it dies while in the womb.
[time=2409] But if while it comes out it lives for any period of time you can claim it as a dependent on your taxes.
[time=2417] Another example of this there is a woman in California one of the state prisons there that is serving an 11 year prison term
[time=2424] because she had her own baby in her own bathroom and the second the baby came out she killed it.
[time=2435] She's prosecuted as a criminal and sent to jail for that.
[time=2438] If that same lady moments before she goes into labor goes to an abortion clinic and aborts the baby there there is no criminal action.
[time=2449] You say it doesn't make sense you're right.
[time=2452] There have been criminals in this country men who have been prosecuted and found guilty for injuring the fetus inside of a pregnant woman
[time=2461] because they attacked the woman successful prosecution against these people yet the medical doctors who commit these atrocities
[time=2470] in the comfort of their own office are without any legal recourse.
[time=2475] You can't prosecute them for anything.
[time=2481] Here's a good one.
[time=2483] It's illegal to ship a pregnant lobster in the United States of America.
[time=2489] That's right.
[time=2491] It's wrong.
[time=2492] You can't do that.
[time=2493] You might hurt the baby lobster inside the pregnant lobster.
[time=2497] Here's another one.
[time=2499] Massachusetts has recently passed an anti cruelty law that makes it illegal to award a goldfish as a prize.
[time=2507] You know like in a carnival you win the thing they give you a goldfish?
[time=2511] Well frankly folks I'm happy for that.
[time=2513] I never did like those goldfishes coming home in those little jars.
[time=2516] But that's not the point.
[time=2518] Listen to the verbiage of the law that they wrote.
[time=2521] Listen to how they articulate their reasoning for this law not to give away goldfish.
[time=2526] Quote, "To protect the tendency to dull humanitarian feelings and corrupt the morals of those who abuse them."
[time=2539] Good night.
[time=2541] That's in law now.
[time=2544] These examples could go on forever.
[time=2547] We are confronted with them every time we turn the television on.
[time=2550] America no longer makes any sense.
[time=2552] You want to know why?
[time=2554] They started by rejecting God.
[time=2556] Secondly, they have begun to worship the creation and the creature more than the creator.
[time=2563] In other words they say that's the most important thing to us.
[time=2565] We have no regard for God and his law.
[time=2568] In response to that God gives a people over to homosexuality.
[time=2572] And as a society folks we are given over to homosexuality.
[time=2576] And it culminates at the end of this chapter in verse 32 by saying we no longer have a mind.
[time=2582] We cannot see right from wrong there is no justice.
[time=2585] We know the ordinance of God.
[time=2587] We know that the people who practice them are worthy of death but it doesn't bother us.
[time=2591] We give hearty approval to those who practice them.
[time=2594] We codify it in state and federal law.
[time=2600] I said I'd come back to verse 18 in the wrath of God.
[time=2603] Look at verse 18 again.
[time=2605] For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.
[time=2610] Let me tell you something the wrath of God is coming.
[time=2612] I don't know when.
[time=2614] I don't want to try to give you a date.
[time=2615] I don't want it to even happen but it's coming.
[time=2618] Let me tell you why.
[time=2619] In Psalm 106 verses 37 and 38 it describes the people of Israel, the mothers and the fathers who got caught up in what we believe to be molic worship.
[time=2627] Was it a pagan worship of their day?
[time=2629] And it was a fertility cult of some kind.
[time=2631] They wanted more babies.
[time=2632] They wanted more crops.
[time=2635] More sheep.
[time=2636] More all that stuff.
[time=2637] And so they got caught up in this molic worship and they took their actual literal living children.
[time=2642] And they sacrificed them on these idols.
[time=2645] They killed them there.
[time=2647] And it says in Psalm 106 verse 38 and the land was polluted with their blood.
[time=2653] They polluted their own land.
[time=2656] It stained the land in God's eyes.
[time=2661] In Genesis 4, 10 the first murder in the Bible.
[time=2664] Cain slew Abel and God comes to Cain and he says what have you done?
[time=2668] The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.
[time=2673] In other words God personifies the voice of the blood.
[time=2677] And it says if it's crying out to God for justice and retaliation for the execution of its murderer.
[time=2683] Well you just take all these 25 million aborted babies and sprinkle their blood all around
[time=2690] our nation and stain our soil and allow their voice then to cry back to the God of Heaven for justice.
[time=2697] I believe that's what's going on.
[time=2700] It's a shameful thing.
[time=2704] And God would be shameful if he didn't respond.
[time=2708] As somebody once put it, if God doesn't wipe us out he's going to have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=2716] One of the thing about our country in John 844 it says this Satan is a murderer.
[time=2723] Satan is a murderer.
[time=2725] In 2 Corinthians chapter 4 it says that Satan is the prince of the power of the air.
[time=2732] Do you realize that Satan has delighted in the murder of babies since the beginning of time?
[time=2738] It was when Moses was coming into existence that Satan orchestrated this mass slaughter of babies through the nation of Egypt.
[time=2746] Satan did it again through Herod at the time of Christ.
[time=2750] Satan delights in murders.
[time=2751] It seems as if Satan takes extra delight in the murder of an unborn or a newly born child.
[time=2758] And as such we as a nation have fallen into the hands of Satan and have become one of his most able, professional, technologically advanced instruments of murdering children he's ever had in all the history of the world.
[time=2770] We can do it faster and cleaner and more severely than any other group of people that have ever graced the face of this earth.
[time=2780] Let me move now to the last question as we wrap this up.
[time=2783] Thank you for your patience with me this morning.
[time=2786] This last question is what is the Christian response to abortion in America?
[time=2790] What are we to do?
[time=2791] Is there any hope?
[time=2793] What is our response?
[time=2794] How are we to live in this day?
[time=2795] Well let me speak to three different categories, the individual, the family in the church, first the individual.
[time=2800] And I think this goes without saying to the individual I would say don't get an abortion.
[time=2806] Your response to all of this and to the word of God is to refuse to have an abortion.
[time=2811] Even if you find yourself pregnant out of wedlock, even if you find yourself pregnant because you've been raped, why?
[time=2818] Because conception is an act of God and life begins in the womb and what has created is in the image of God.
[time=2824] That's why.
[time=2826] And even if what you have in your womb is medically determined to have down syndrome or some other type of horrendous medical problem, refuse and abortion, you say what do you
[time=2835] mean even sick kids, even really really sick kids?
[time=2839] Well what does Exodus 4 11 say?
[time=2842] It says this, "Who has made man's mouth or who makes him dumb or deaf or seeing or blind?
[time=2850] Is it not I who, the Lord?" In John chapter 9 there's a man who has been blind from birth.
[time=2859] He never's been able to see and the big question the Pharisees are asking is is he blind because of the sin of his parents or because of his own sin?
[time=2866] And Jesus responds by saying neither.
[time=2870] It was in order that the works of God might be displayed in him, John 9 verse 2.
[time=2878] My friends we are dealing here with the life that God has created for his own purpose and in his own way to his own glory and if it happens to be horribly sick.
[time=2887] As I said last Sunday, accept that as one of the trials that will produce joy in your life and watch God give you the strength, the love and care even for the unlovely.
[time=2896] So refuse to have an abortion.
[time=2898] You say is it ever right to have an abortion?
[time=2900] Is it ever right under any circumstances?
[time=2902] And I would say yes, one circumstance.
[time=2906] In the very rare case where both the life of the infant and the life of the mother are both surely going to die if the pregnancy continues.
[time=2917] Is in those cases where the life of the infant and the life of the mother will surely die that the baby should be taken?
[time=2926] But it should be taken as late as possible and it should be taken with every care made possible to ensure it's life.
[time=2934] Why do you say that so strongly?
[time=2936] Why are I just told you?
[time=2938] Because conception is an act of God.
[time=2941] What is conceived is a human life.
[time=2943] What is conceived is conceived in the image of God and there isn't a sanctity of life that we have no business tampering with.
[time=2952] Number two to the individual.
[time=2953] Use your freedom to fight abortion.
[time=2955] In this country you have certain freedoms and however God lays it upon your heart to become involved in the political process or in standing down there on that street on Thursday morning and praying and just letting it be known that there's another way to live or whether you want to call Judy Hapke at the crisis pregnancy center here in Fort Wayne.
[time=2973] And speaking with her this week she noted to me that she's thankful for the many counselors that come from our church, peer counselors to that pregnancy but she needs more.
[time=2981] She'd be happy to train you and put you in place in a very tangible step.
[time=2985] Next to the family, I want to talk to you people who like Heidi and I have young children.
[time=2990] As I was standing out there on that street on Thursday morning I said to myself I need to bring my girls down here.
[time=2997] They need to hear and see and watch and experience this stuff and I'm sure that Heidi and I when we think each child has come to that appropriate age we'll do that with them.
[time=3006] I'd encourage you to do the same.
[time=3008] Josh McDowell has done surveys about the sexual activity and the abortion rates between the unsaved teenager and the saved teenager, the unchristian teenager and the Christian teenager and he has found that there is very little difference in their activity.
[time=3022] Very little difference in their activity.
[time=3025] Don't assume that because you and I are surrounded here by the wonders of Black Hawk Baptist Church and this strong Christian school for those of us who have our kids there that our kids aren't influenced in this way that they don't feel these pressures, that they aren't exposed to all this stuff you're deceiving yourself.
[time=3040] Secondly, I want to say educate your children sexually.
[time=3044] If you haven't sat down with your 10, 11, 12 year old with a good book that can be provided by Dobson's organization or you can find in one of our Christian bookstores that helps you with great purity and reverence for the creative act of God walk through the pro-creative
[time=3059] process so that your child learns that from you not from somebody else.
[time=3064] I think you've missed a great opportunity to hedge your child and your family against this pervasive immorality.
[time=3071] The next thing I would say to the family is this, we must try to maintain a balance.
[time=3075] On the one hand, we hold a standard for our children that is obedience to the word of God and they know what we expect.
[time=3080] We don't expect them to violate God's law with respect to moral chastity.
[time=3085] It's unthinkable that our children would run around and do those kinds of things because we love God and we want to honor God.
[time=3090] At the same time, there has to be a balance.
[time=3093] The kids have to know that if they should violate the law of God and if they should become pregnant, that what they find in their parents and what they find in this church is support and love and forgiveness and help so that they do not under an isolated pressure of feeling cast away and cast out find their way down to some abortion clinic and say it's better for me to do like David and try to cover one sin with a second.
[time=3116] Somehow we must strike the balance.
[time=3119] Lastly as a church.
[time=3122] You see, in response to this message, should we take all of our energies and all of our money and all of our talent and all of our time and become politically active to overturn these great decisions, these horrendous decisions that allow for these kinds of abortions.
[time=3135] Should that be our focus?
[time=3136] Should that be what we're known for in Fort Wayne?
[time=3139] Should we just become the champions against this horrible cause?
[time=3143] No.
[time=3144] Absolutely not.
[time=3145] You say why not?
[time=3148] This church needs to do what the word of God tells us to do and there is never anywhere in the New Testament and injunction a command or instruction to the church at large as the body of Christ to become politically active.
[time=3161] Our mission is above and beyond politics.
[time=3163] Our mission is the kingdom of God.
[time=3165] You want to know what we're supposed to do?
[time=3166] Win people to Christ and disciple them.
[time=3168] And let me help you out.
[time=3170] If we win enough people to Christ and disciple them in this city, there won't be any abortions anymore.
[time=3175] Our mission is not to as a church, as a church now.
[time=3180] That's a critical identification.
[time=3182] As individuals, we need people running for office.
[time=3184] We need people donating to those kinds of men.
[time=3186] We need the support.
[time=3188] We need that kind of stuff.
[time=3189] The march yesterday as individuals, but as a church, it's just not our call in life.
[time=3195] It's not what we are to do.
[time=3197] So as a church, we'll continue to preach the word, win people to Christ, and affect this
[time=3203] society as God has called us to do that.
[time=3206] But one last thought that is very encouraging.
[time=3208] Since 1985, when the Crisis Pregnancy Center began, this church has been a major supporter of it.
[time=3214] Every month, we send that place money, and I'm happy to report to you that from my visit with Judy, that place is as sharp and as clean and in the pursuit of excellence as anything I've ever seen.
[time=3223] And there's ever a reason to believe that when a young lady goes in there wondering what to do with that little life inside of her, that if she can look at those people in that facility and see the character and the excellence with which they are pursuing helping them, that little girl has every chance of getting the help she needs.
[time=3242] And here's another thing we don't want to be as a church.
[time=3244] We don't want to be like the temples in Japan.
[time=3247] Japan has aggressively pursued abortion as a society for many, many years longer than the United States has, almost twice as long as the United States has.
[time=3255] And they have now reaped what they have sown, and there are hundreds and thousands and hundreds
[time=3261] of thousands of women in Japan who are evidencing all kinds of problems because of the guilt
[time=3267] associated with their previous abortions.
[time=3271] And so the religious people of that nation have built new temples.
[time=3275] They are called temples of the water baby, the water baby, when the baby was still in the womb.
[time=3282] And if you were to go there, you would find hundreds of Japanese women there offering up prayers that somehow their God would protect and save these little lives that they have
[time=3291] aborted.
[time=3292] And for $150, they can pay their priest and he'll pray for their little baby.
[time=3299] And for $200, they can buy a little icon, which in some way represents their little aborted baby, and they can place that appropriately in the temple.
[time=3309] My friends, the offer here is nothing but absolute total freedom and forgiveness to the grace of God and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[time=3318] And that is our message to those who have been hurt by abortion, to those women who have fallen into that trap, our message is nothing but absolute, unadulterated forgiveness from
[time=3329] the person of Christ.
[time=3331] And it's free, it's without charge.
[time=3334] And you want to know what my personal conviction is based upon my study from the Word of God, that what happens to those little babies that are aborted?
[time=3343] People are sent to hell because they reject the God of creation, Romans 1, Romans 1, and because they reject Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
[time=3351] A little itty bitty baby developing infant in the womb never had a chance to do either.
[time=3356] And it's beyond my comprehension how a gracious God who would give up his own child to save
[time=3363] people from their sins would send a little precious life that never had a chance, even
[time=3369] to glean from general revelation, the creation itself, the existence of God, how he would send that little one to hell.
[time=3377] I believe with all my heart, all those little kids, all those little babies are waiting for us in heaven because of the gracious, compassionate mercy of God.
[time=3387] Let's pray it again.
[time=3407] If you're one of the millions of women across the country who have aborted a child, then
[time=3413] you're feeling the guilt of that, and you've never come to Christ, then you'd like to receive him as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3418] Would you bow your head with me and pray this prayer?
[time=3421] Father, I know that I am a sinner not just because of an abortion in my past, but in
[time=3428] all walks of my life I recognize I fall short of your glory.
[time=3433] I believe that you sent your son Jesus Christ to pay the penalty for my sin, I ask him into my heart to wash and cleanse me from my sin, and through that receive the grace and the forgiveness of God that I so much need and want.
[time=3446] Thank you for salvation in Jesus Christ, in whose name I pray, amen.
[time=3452] If you prayed to receive Christ, we'd like you to write us and let us know that so we
[time=3458] could send you a booklet called Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your Christian walk.
