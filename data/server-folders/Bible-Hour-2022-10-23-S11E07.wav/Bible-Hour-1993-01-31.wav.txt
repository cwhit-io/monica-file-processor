[time=0] In America, however, for the first some 150 years of our history, homosexuality was an
[time=16] unmentionable.
[time=17] It was considered impolite and undignified.
[time=20] It was rude to speak of homosexuality in public.
[time=24] It was called the unmentionable vice or the love that dare not speak its name, and those who did talk about it were in the medical community.
[time=31] And they talked about it under the category of a pathology, the study of a disorder or a disease or as a crime.
[time=52] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=60] Thank you for joining us.
[time=62] The homosexual movement in America today is striving and pressing to have their homosexuality viewed as normal, moral, and acceptable.
[time=71] They want to declassify it from its traditional perception as an abnormal criminal act and
[time=77] reclassify it as a genetic compulsion which entitles them to all the rights of any legitimate minority group.
[time=84] What does the Bible say about homosexuality?
[time=87] Is homosexual behavior sin?
[time=90] Is homosexuality an inborn genetic orientation?
[time=94] This morning, Pastor Moore brings to light relevant truth from God's word to help us understand homosexuality from God's perspective.
[time=103] Because of the importance of today's topic, today's program will be devoted entirely to Pastor Moore's message.
[time=111] Let's now join our service.
[time=115] If you have your Bibles with you this morning, let me ask you to turn to Genesis chapter 19.
[time=124] This morning, I want to speak to you on the topic of homosexuality.
[time=130] And just so you'll have a sense of where we're headed, when I came back from California, there early January, we took up the topic of personal resolutions.
[time=140] And then last Lord's Day, we talked about abortion this Lord's Day, we'll talk about homosexuality.
[time=146] And those will really set the scene for us next Sunday.
[time=148] I hope to come back and talk to you about the church.
[time=152] And who Blackhawk Baptist Church can and needs to be in 1993.
[time=157] But these two intervening messages about our culture and about our day, about America as we're experiencing it.
[time=164] Come along, will you as I read the first several verses of Genesis chapter 19.
[time=171] Now the two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting in the gate of Sodom.
[time=176] When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.
[time=181] And he said, "Now behold, my Lord, please turn aside into your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet that then you may rise early and go your way." They said, "However, no, but we shall spend the night in the square." Yet he urged them strongly.
[time=195] So they turned aside to him and entered his house and he prepared a feast for them and baked unleavened bread and they ate.
[time=203] Before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter.
[time=213] And they called to Lot and said to him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight?
[time=217] Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them." But Lot went out to them and at the doorway and shut the door behind him and said, "Please, my brothers, do not act wickedly.
[time=230] Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with men.
[time=234] Please let me bring them to you and do to them whatever you like, only do nothing to
[time=240] these men in as much as they have come unto the shelter of my roof." But they said, "Stand aside.
[time=247] Furthermore," they said, "this one came in as an alien, and already he is acting like a judge, now we will treat you worse than them." So they pressed hard against Lot and came near to break the door.
[time=262] But the men reached out their hands and brought Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
[time=267] And they struck the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway.
[time=282] Where does homosexuality come from?
[time=285] How does all this get started?
[time=289] Homosexuality comes from the root of sin in men's heart and from our earliest accounts
[time=295] of human civilization we are encountering homosexuality.
[time=299] I might add that in this the very first book of the Bible we can find accounts of fornication, adultery, incest, rape, prostitution and polygamy.
[time=309] Homosexuality is not singled out in the book of Genesis, but man is depraved and given over to sin and we find that even its earliest accounts from the Word of God.
[time=319] Sexual sin and perversion finds its root in the sinful heart of man so we can track its existence to the earliest record of man.
[time=329] Millions of Assyria, Babylon and Egypt find accounts of homosexuality.
[time=335] Many believe that several of the pharaohs of Egypt were homosexuals.
[time=340] Socrates, Plato, Alexander the Great, many men in his army, Julius Caesar, in fact some
[time=347] historians say that 14 out of the first 15 Caesars were homosexual.
[time=352] Nero, the very Nero that reigned in Paul's day was homosexual.
[time=356] He had taken a young boy by the name of Sporus.
[time=359] He had castrated him and married him in public ceremony and lived with him the rest of his life as a wife.
[time=366] The Nero that followed that Nero also took Sporus.
[time=370] In America it has been considered rude, impolite and out of order to speak publicly about homosexuality.
[time=378] It was known as the unmentionable vise, the love that dare not speak its name.
[time=382] And when those who did speak about it, they were physicians and members of the medical community who studied it under the category of pathology, a disorder that which is abnormal,
[time=392] that which is not right.
[time=394] And they also spoke of it as a crime.
[time=398] Sigmund Freud became fascinated with homosexuality and after much research determined in his opinion that it was physiological disorder directly related, excuse me, a psychological disorder
[time=408] directly related to a domineering mother.
[time=413] Harlock Ellis in the 1930s published a manual, a book, a sex book in which he said that Freud
[time=420] was wrong.
[time=421] It's not an environmentally induced disorder.
[time=423] It's a genetic genius listing in his history, great men and their accomplishments like Michel
[time=431] Angelo, Oscar Wilde, Walt Whitman.
[time=434] So he proposed that it was not a disorder at all, that it was instead a genetic genius.
[time=440] Albert Kinsey in the Kinsey reports of the 40s and the 50s himself, a sexual, pervert, grossly exaggerating finds to say that one out of every 10 people in America were homosexual.
[time=452] His research has since been debunked by various scholars who can attest to the exaggeration of his claims.
[time=460] The American Psychological Association adopted basically Ellis's approach as a genetic condition
[time=469] and then also finding some strength and support in the Kinsey reports they then officially declassified homosexuality as a mental sickness and removed it from its standard of diagnostic
[time=479] lists of diseases and illnesses.
[time=483] And so with the momentum of the 60s and the whole free love movement, the moral avalanche
[time=489] which threatens to bury any remnant of moral conscience in this country began.
[time=495] Let me talk now about a little bit about the homosexual agenda and we're well aware of much of this, but just to put it in focus, first of all in the military of course, the homosexual community is bent on this ban or the lifting of this ban of homosexuals in
[time=510] the military.
[time=511] In the years 1985, '86 and '87 the military officially discharged some 4,000 men and women
[time=517] from active duty or from duty at all rather because of their homosexuality.
[time=522] That has brought on a great number of lawsuits.
[time=526] They are seeking this removal because they want to remove any stigma that may be attached
[time=532] to homosexuality.
[time=534] They fight it there and they also are fighting it at the state level.
[time=537] May it or you to know that since about 19 or prior to 1960, there were laws on the books
[time=544] in every state of the union that said that sodomy was against the law, whether it be found in heterosexuals or homosexuals, whether they were consenting adults, it was against the law to perform the act of sodomy in all states of the United States of America.
[time=561] Believe they adopted that taking their cues from English law in the colonies which made
[time=567] sodomy a punishable crime by death, Leviticus 20 is probably their resource for that.
[time=574] Thomas Jefferson believed that castration was a more poetic form of justice for sodomy.
[time=582] As of 1961, Illinois became the first state to repeal sodomy laws and now only 24 states
[time=589] still have sodomy laws on their books.
[time=592] They really have never been enforced with an intent to invade the privacy of the bedroom to put some type of surveillance of the private sex life of Americans.
[time=602] It was instead a tool in the hands of law enforcement officials who when a young boy would be accosted or some type of public display of this sexual disorder were in evidence.
[time=612] They had laws on their books that they could arrest people and put them in jail for that.
[time=617] But gay activists seek to repeal the sodomy laws to remove the stigma of criminality from homosexual practices.
[time=625] They are on the very aggressive approach with the family in America.
[time=630] They want to have children, they want to have full rights with children.
[time=634] It's known as the lesbian baby boom or the gay bee boom.
[time=637] New York Times national estimates that as many as 10,000 children in this country are being raised by gay women.
[time=644] One article I read said this, there are more lesbian couples, excuse me, more lesbian couples are deciding to have children frequently by obtaining sperm from a male relative of
[time=654] the other.
[time=655] So the child will be related to both.
[time=658] Some lesbian couples seek sperm from a gay male friend and in some cases gay men have sought lesbians to share parenting responsibilities.
[time=667] In these types of cases on the birth certificate is placed the name of one of the lesbian partners as the mother and the other name of the other lesbian partner as the father, which makes
[time=678] it very difficult when these couples, quote unquote, decide to separate and child custody becomes an issue.
[time=685] AIDS has really slowed down the homosexual movement at first, but they've turned it around
[time=691] in many ways and to their, if you will, to their credit.
[time=694] They have sought civil rights protection for people infected with AIDS or are HIV positive.
[time=701] And as a result, no one is allowed to know if anyone else is infected with HIV unless under very extreme situations.
[time=708] They have successfully pressured the government to allocate enormous funds for AIDS research, despite what you hear from them.
[time=715] It may interest you to note that half a million people die of cancer in America every year.
[time=720] One out of four of us will contract cancer and the AIDS funding and research is good,
[time=727] but this is intriguing.
[time=729] The government gives 10 times as much money per AIDS patient as they do per cancer patient
[time=737] to find the cure for various diseases.
[time=739] They're aggressive in public as education, as we'll note here in a minute, because of the AIDS trauma.
[time=745] They are now bringing into the public education forum, Sex Education, which includes information about homosexuality.
[time=751] They have also forced the government to cut an enormous amount of red tape to free up experimental drugs that may be cures or solutions to the AIDS virus.
[time=762] Under the heading of family and under the impetus of AIDS, they are now seeking visitation to rights inside of hospitals, where before it would only be a family member who would be allowed to see a patient in critical position under threat of legislation and lawsuits.
[time=777] Hospitals are now allowing gay partners to have the same privileges as did families.
[time=782] Gay people are insisting on health benefits.
[time=785] In other words, if a gay person or a homosexual person is in a relationship with another homosexual person and that homosexual person has health care benefits from their job that would otherwise be extended to their family where they married and have kids, the gay community is insisting that they have those same health benefits.
[time=802] They are also striving for survivor benefits.
[time=805] One case I read about where a homosexual died because of AIDS and the lease for their apartment was in his name and his name only.
[time=814] And once he died, then the landlord would be able to raise the rent.
[time=818] But they can't do that or they are seeking not to be able to do that because they're claiming survivor rights or survivor status.
[time=824] I am as a wife would have been and so the contract extends to me or I am as a husband
[time=830] would have been so the contract extends to me.
[time=833] The family's definition is moving from the traditional position which we derive from the word of God, one man, one woman in the bonds of holy matrimony for life to that which
[time=843] is based on emotional and economic commitment.
[time=846] A family is defined on the level of its emotional and economic commitment one to another rather than the technicalities of a marriage license.
[time=855] That leads us to bills that come into the domestic partnership order where a homosexual
[time=862] couple would be able to register their relationship for a fee of $35 with a county clerk and there
[time=869] receive all the benefits and privileges of traditional families.
[time=874] In the arena of the school it was really surgeon general coups announcement and result to his
[time=880] age research in 1986 where he said this, "There is now no doubt that we need sex education
[time=887] in schools and that it must include information on heterosexual and homosexual relationships.
[time=892] We have to be as explicit as necessary in order to get the message across.
[time=897] You can't talk about the dangers of snake poisoning and not mention snakes."
[time=904] A public opinion poll taken shortly after his announcement recorded that 86% it was an historic
[time=911] high for America, 86% of the adult population was supporting sex education in public schools.
[time=919] That really opened the door and now what is walking through it in one case is what we call the children of the rainbow, an educational curriculum in the New York City school districts
[time=930] which has books under recommended and required reading.
[time=939] These are books that are recommended reading for first graders in the New York school district.
[time=943] Another one for first graders, daddy's roommate which features a happy youngster with two male parents who concludes that quote being gay is just another kind of love.
[time=954] Children directly given to the teachers facilitating the children of the rainbow curriculum are
[time=960] given this and I quote, "Children must be taught to acknowledge the positive aspects of each type of household." So the country moves this thing of homosexuality from a crime to a place of tolerance now to full fledged endorsement and support at our earliest ages.
[time=979] In the high schools of America, it was recently published in the Education Digest that educators school board members and parents are being praised for acknowledging quote struggling to cope with their sexual identity, gay and bisexual students are more likely than other youth to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol and have academic problems.
[time=999] Then they go on to say this, tagging these young people quote unquote at risk, providing support services, establishing policies and guidelines and integrating homosexuality into
[time=1010] sex education, acknowledging sexual differences among young people.
[time=1015] That is what the educators and board members of America are being praised for in the Education Digest, establishing policies, guidelines and integrating homosexuality to sex education and acknowledging sexual differences among young people.
[time=1029] They are very aggressive in the media and the media seems to be working as hand in hand
[time=1037] as one could possibly imagine.
[time=1040] Talk shows such as Donahue or Horaldo or Oprah or talk soup and all the rest of these seem
[time=1047] to delight in parading the sexual perversions of our country in front of us on a daily basis.
[time=1053] But the gay community has a bone to pick with the executives of Hollywood.
[time=1057] They are very angered at them for to date not producing a major budget motion picture
[time=1063] to hit the movie theaters of America that would support the AIDS concern and homosexuals.
[time=1069] They are accusing them of allowing money to dictate their ideology.
[time=1074] They are angry that the Hollywood executives are happy to come to the AIDS benefits and happy to support the homosexual ideology in private and at fundraisers but they are reluctant
[time=1084] to produce a high budget movie to support this whole concern.
[time=1089] Well, it's coming. Hollywood executives are now ready to test the market and see if they
[time=1095] can make money on movies about gays and movies about gays with AIDS.
[time=1100] One movie soon to hit the scene is called Philadelphia.
[time=1103] It will star Tom Hanks and he is a lawyer in that movie who has been fired from his job and who is represented by a lawyer with homophobia.
[time=1112] And so all of those issues can be discussed from the vantage of Hollywood.
[time=1117] All heart is another major screen production that's on its way.
[time=1120] Barbara Streisand has agreed to direct and star in it.
[time=1123] It concerns the AIDS theme.
[time=1125] Family values is another movie on its way.
[time=1127] Two brothers, one straight and the other gay and sick.
[time=1132] So our youth potentially will be asking for permission to go view these movies and to see them as they would any other great and wonderfully exciting compelling Hollywood movie.
[time=1144] The future, they are seeking and have legislative initiatives pending on the following, immigration
[time=1150] policy, biased, motivated crime, public employment outside of the military and homoeroticism
[time=1159] in the arts.
[time=1161] Let me try to bring this together under a title called The Homosexual Platform.
[time=1166] There are basically two major bulwarks of the homosexual platform.
[time=1170] The first is what I call genetic compulsion.
[time=1174] In other words, they are seeking acceptance in our society not under the banner of pro choice.
[time=1180] They want to be as far away from the pro choice rationale as they possibly can.
[time=1185] What they want to say is we are homosexuals genetically.
[time=1189] We are homosexuals by birth.
[time=1191] To be homosexual is just what I was born and for you to deny me the opportunity to express my homosexuality and to have all the rights of any other person is for you to deny me of what I am essentially.
[time=1205] Gerald Newberry, coordinator of Virginia Fairfax County Family Life Education Program says this,
[time=1211] "We need to communicate to our kids that people are different and that we don't choose our sexual feelings, they choose us."
[time=1222] What a year old John Craig of Massachusetts who organizes weekend retreats for bisexual men says this, "I want to experience contact with a man's body and with a woman's body.
[time=1233] That's just a basic part of who I am."
[time=1239] In the words of a lesbian pastor, a former lesbian pastor of a United Methodist church, speaking of the moment she finally accepted her homosexuality, she says this, "I felt that God was smiling and saying, 'You are finally the one I wanted you to be.'"
[time=1257] So it is in their mind innate, it is instinctive, it is the essential ontological you to be homosexual,
[time=1264] to be gay, to be a lesbian and really the only choice that they have is to live private lives in a closet which would be a suppressed life or to come out into the open as hard as that may be and stand up for what they are.
[time=1277] In the words of one homosexual Eric Marcus, I quote, "When I realized I was gay, I also realized I did have a choice, but not between homosexuality and heterosexuality.
[time=1289] I could choose to live in the closet, maybe even marry a woman and pretend to be who I am not or I could be honest about who I am and live my life openly, not an easy thing
[time=1299] to do.
[time=1301] I didn't choose to be gay, but I did choose to tell the truth, that's what my parents
[time=1307] taught me." So the first foundational element of the gay platform in America today is that we are
[time=1316] gay, we are homosexual, we are lesbian, not by choice, but by virtue of our intrinsic
[time=1323] nature which leads us then to their second major bulwark of their platform and that
[time=1329] would be they want to be perceived, perceived and treated like a racial minority.
[time=1336] In other words, they want to be seen as a legitimate interest group, a racial minority, the gay rights movement or as they call themselves in the political regime the human rights campaign
[time=1347] fund which contributed some one million dollars to the political campaign for this last presidency.
[time=1355] By declassifying it as a pathology or a crime, they are seeking legislation that gives them
[time=1361] the rights of any minority group like Hispanics or blacks or handicapped people.
[time=1366] They detest any portrayal of their behavior as abnormal and immoral, that's called gay bashing or homophobia.
[time=1375] They are striving and pressing to have their homosexuality viewed as normal, moral and acceptable and therefore the rights of any other citizen in the United States of America.
[time=1388] In my opinion, that is a rather bright approach.
[time=1392] In other words, though I don't agree with it and I am against it entirely, I have to look at it and say that has some wisdom.
[time=1400] In an age in a country where we no longer have a God and we no longer have moral absolutes,
[time=1407] what they are saying and the rationale they are building will take them far and they will be very successful in getting what they want with those basic elements in their platform.
[time=1418] They'll seek it in the military, they'll seek it in state law and family and school.
[time=1422] But the question is this, what does God's words say about homosexuality?
[time=1428] What is the truth about homosexuality and this morning I want to give it to you my impressions of it from the word of God along three basic principles, three basic principles about homosexuality.
[time=1438] The first is this, homosexual behavior is sin.
[time=1445] And let me pause before I jump into this point, I want to say a couple of things.
[time=1448] First of all, again, I don't want this message to be perceived and it is not in my heart to preach a political message.
[time=1455] This issue is obviously embroiled in our politics and therefore you can draw your own conclusions but that is not the intent of my message.
[time=1462] My message is to speak the truth from God's word about an issue which is being raised with the surface by politics.
[time=1468] Secondly, in a group our size there may be a number who are struggling with homosexuality,
[time=1475] some who are even married and struggling with homosexuality and the tendencies of homosexuality.
[time=1480] Some of you may be homosexuals, some of you may have struggled with that in your past and have since come to Christ and continue to struggle with that at some level.
[time=1487] This message is not designed to beat you up.
[time=1490] This is not designed to single you out and beat on your head until you're dead.
[time=1495] This instead is a message that I hope will help you who are struggling with homosexuality to view rightly against the onslaught of propaganda that you must receive every day
[time=1504] of your life just by virtue of being an American, that would bolster your cause to live for Christ.
[time=1511] And for those who are not struggling with homosexuality, that's never been an issue.
[time=1515] This is a message that's designed also to confront the propaganda, but also to teach you and to instruct you and to help you as you relate with homosexual people in your
[time=1525] jobs and on your streets and where you live.
[time=1528] And I trust that we are seeking to win these folks to Christ.
[time=1533] I trust that we are seeking to approach them in a manner which is commensurate with the love of Christ.
[time=1538] And so these three points really are designed to do both confront a world mindset and also to instruct us in the ways of Christ to help homosexual people.
[time=1548] Point number one, homosexual behavior is sin.
[time=1550] We can begin here in the Old Testament.
[time=1552] You already have your Bibles open to Genesis chapter 19.
[time=1555] Look at verses 24 and 25.
[time=1557] This is a real bold statement.
[time=1559] By God, he's speaking louder with his actions than his words at this point.
[time=1563] Then the Lord rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven.
[time=1569] And he overthrew those cities and all the valley and all the inhabitants of the cities and what drew on the ground.
[time=1576] God wiped out Sodom and Gomorrah.
[time=1579] They were cities absolutely given over to homosexuality and God destroyed them.
[time=1584] And we would be foolish to look at this passage and draw the conclusion of Pastor Troy Perry who was pastor of the gay Metropolitan Church and say that God really destroyed Sodom because
[time=1595] of their lack of hospitality.
[time=1598] That is their basic understanding of this passage.
[time=1600] These two angels came and they were not treated hospitably and so God destroyed them.
[time=1605] Not so God destroyed them for their homosexuality.
[time=1609] Leviticus chapter 20, a term with me there just for a minute.
[time=1614] Here God is speaking louder with his words than his actions.
[time=1616] He just says it very plainly and very clearly.
[time=1619] Leviticus chapter 20 verse 13, if there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie
[time=1625] with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act.
[time=1630] They shall surely be put to death.
[time=1632] Their blood guiltiness is upon them.
[time=1635] Here God is saying that it is a detestable act and that the penalty for such behavior is the death penalty.
[time=1642] Which again is where the laws of England I think drew their support as they were heavily influenced by the Judeo-Christian ethic.
[time=1650] You don't need to turn there but Deuteronomy 22.5, Deuteronomy 22.5 says this.
[time=1655] A woman shall not wear a man's clothing nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing.
[time=1661] For whoever does these things is an abomination to the Lord our God.
[time=1666] Some of you come out of legalistic churches and in the past you've heard this verse used to say that women should never wear slacks or women should never wear pants or women should never, you know, wear any type of shoe that looks like a man's shoe.
[time=1679] That is not what God is saying here.
[time=1680] God is confronting a perverted sense of a transvestite who is in fact a man and wants
[time=1687] to dress like a woman.
[time=1688] He's saying that's an abomination.
[time=1691] That's a perversion of the creative order.
[time=1694] There are other places we could go in the Old Testament.
[time=1697] But in the interest of time turn now to the first book of Corinthians, 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9.
[time=1705] The same truth is carried over into the New Testament.
[time=1712] 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 9.
[time=1716] Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[time=1722] Do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor
[time=1728] homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1736] The two words there that refer to homosexuality are effeminate and homosexual.
[time=1740] The word effeminate in the Greek could be literally translated soft or passive and it
[time=1746] is used in Greek literature as the female partner in a homosexual relationship.
[time=1752] This is the receiving female soft partner that's being described there.
[time=1756] The homosexual typically is describing the aggressive partner in that relationship and so Paul covers the gamut of this perverse behavior.
[time=1765] The effeminate nor the homosexuality and he couldn't be any clearer.
[time=1768] They shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=1772] We'll come back to this passage in a minute, but turn to Romans chapter 1.
[time=1777] Romans chapter 1, we were here last Lord's day when we were talking about abortion.
[time=1787] Romans chapter 1, verse 18, God is revealing his wrath on all ungodliness and unrighteousness
[time=1796] of men because they suppress the truth in unrighteousness.
[time=1800] And in this passage he gives people over three times, one in verse 24, he gives people over to their own lusts.
[time=1807] It's described there, the lust of their hearts to impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them.
[time=1812] That's talking about fornication and adultery.
[time=1814] When a society gives up on God and moral absolutes, God gives them over to their lusts, which expresses itself first in heterosexual fornication and sin of that sort.
[time=1826] In verse 26 he gives them over again.
[time=1828] For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions.
[time=1832] For their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire towards one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons to do penalty of their heir.
[time=1848] In other words, God, when he gives people over as a response of his wrath to their rejecting
[time=1855] his existence, he gives them over to heterosexuality and he gives them over to homosexuality as
[time=1861] an expression of his wrath.
[time=1865] And then in verse 28, and just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind to do the things which are no longer proper.
[time=1874] And we talked about that last Lord's Day.
[time=1876] They can do things that are absolutely wrong, know they're wrong, but affirm themselves and everybody else in the behavior.
[time=1882] It's a mind without a mind, it's a seared conscience.
[time=1885] You say this sounds awfully harsh.
[time=1888] Why would God give people over to immorality and then to homosexuality and then to a depraved
[time=1894] mind?
[time=1895] Well, I don't have time to develop it for you, but the whole book of Romans is about the gospel.
[time=1901] This is a benevolent act of God.
[time=1903] God is turning people over to a fuller expression of their sin so that they can see how sinful they are and repent and come to Christ.
[time=1911] It is both an act of his wrath and an act of his mercy at the same time because he longs for them to see the sinfulness of their sin and so by giving them over to it in greater degree he hopes they'll see how far they've strayed from the right understanding of God and repent and come to Christ.
[time=1930] Look again at verses 26 and 27, do you notice the word natural and unnatural showing up
[time=1936] often?
[time=1937] Verse 26, the natural function for that which is unnatural, verse 27, they have abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire towards one another?
[time=1948] It interests me that one of the major premises of the homosexual movement in America today is that we are natural.
[time=1955] We are normal.
[time=1956] What we are doing is a natural expression of what we are and yet it is in direct conflict
[time=1962] to the word of God which says it is unnatural.
[time=1965] You have given up what is natural and you have taken to yourself what is unnatural.
[time=1970] It's just another evidence that Satan is absolutely totally opposed to God and where he has opportunity
[time=1976] he will just go head to head and he'll permeate a whole wind of doctrine and thought inside a community or a society that is absolutely antagonistic and opposite to the truth of God's word.
[time=1988] Secondly, notice that it says here in verse 27, at the end of the verse men with men committing
[time=1995] indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the dew penalty of their heir.
[time=2000] Sometimes people ask me, is AIDS a unique and special curse that God has brought into
[time=2006] the world to wipe out all the homosexuals?
[time=2010] The answer to that question is I don't know.
[time=2012] The Bible doesn't talk about AIDS.
[time=2014] This is the closest thing we would get and we're not even sure if this receiving in their own persons the dew penalty of their heir is an emotional psychological spiritual trauma or if it also would include every other disease that has ever come into the human race under the category of venereal disease for the perversions of yesteryear.
[time=2032] Whether it be bestiality or just rampant immorality and the spreading of all these diseases I believe
[time=2038] that all of these venereal diseases and broadening that to AIDS is in general an expression of God's wrath and punishment for people who violate his divine order.
[time=2049] But I don't think I'm comfortable going so far because I don't think there's any biblical authority to say yes, AIDS we can single that out and say that's God's wrath on the homosexual community.
[time=2059] Part of the thing I want you to see about this little passage.
[time=2066] Notice in verse 27 it says that in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire towards one another, men with men.
[time=2076] That's a strong Greek construction of an overpowering lust.
[time=2081] The phraseology there when it says they burned in their desire that is describing something extraordinary that is describing just an obsessive compulsive demanding craving lust that will
[time=2093] know no ends to find its gratification.
[time=2095] Let me give you some statistics about homosexual behavior that you may not have heard before.
[time=2100] The average homosexual in America has relationships with some 500 partners.
[time=2108] In Los Angeles where it far exceeds the national average my hometown there are some 300 partners
[time=2116] every year.
[time=2119] Homosexuals in America have some 300 partners every year.
[time=2126] 30% of homosexuals surveyed said they have over 1,000 sexual partners in their lifetime.
[time=2133] Some reported as many as 1,500 I don't even know how you keep count of that kind of phenomena.
[time=2140] Before the AIDS era they surveyed the conduct of gays or homosexuals in the bathhouses of
[time=2146] San Francisco.
[time=2148] They found that these people would frequent these places about three times a week and
[time=2154] each night, each time they went there they would have between 10 and 30 anonymous encounters.
[time=2163] This is just an insatiable lust, a burning consuming lust.
[time=2169] According to the New York Times the man who knows more about violent death than anyone else in the country is Dr. Milton Healthburn, H-E-L-P-H-E-R-N, formerly the chief medical
[time=2180] examiner of New York City.
[time=2184] In his biography entitled "Where Death Delights," Healthburn, not a Christian, wrote this.
[time=2192] It's not my role to condemn homosexuality as such and I leave it to the psychiatrists and psychologists to try to figure out why people practice homosexuality.
[time=2202] But having performed 60,000 autopsies, it is high time that those who deviate from the norm should understand the risks.
[time=2210] I don't know why it is so, but it seems the violent expressions of jealousy among homosexuals
[time=2216] far exceeds those of the jealousy of a man for a woman or a woman for a man.
[time=2220] The pent up charges and energy of the homosexual relationship simply cannot be contained.
[time=2226] When the explosive point is reached the result is brutally violent.
[time=2232] But this is the normal pattern of homosexual attacks, multiple stabbings, senseless beatings
[time=2238] that obviously must continue long after the victim has died.
[time=2242] When we see these brutal, multiple-room cases in a single victim, we automatically assume that we are dealing with a homosexual victim and a homosexual attacker.
[time=2254] Based on 60,000 autopsies in the city of New York, this man says, "I see a clearly
[time=2260] discernible pattern that is uniquely different among homosexual homicides."
[time=2268] I was on the phone with Bob Vernon on Friday talking about the retreat and I took a minute with him.
[time=2274] I said, "Bob, there is this quote I was thinking about using, I don't know, would your experience as Assistant Police Chief of Los Angeles confirm that there is this kind of difference in homosexual
[time=2285] homicides?" He said, "Absolutely, absolutely.
[time=2289] We can show up on a scene and see a scene and within moments that we are there.
[time=2294] We are given evidence that leads us which we are typically correct that this involves a homosexual and a homosexual attacker." So yet, just an apologetic for the word of God, they burn in their desire towards one
[time=2307] another.
[time=2308] Their sexual behavior is excessive and their rage explodes into violent deaths of mutilation
[time=2315] and multiple stabbings long after their victim has since died.
[time=2322] This little premise, homosexual behavior is sin, is what is remarkably missing from all the arguments in the public sector against homosexuality.
[time=2330] Have you noticed that?
[time=2331] There are men that you like, there are men that you support, there are men who are standing against homosexuality in the public sector, but because they can't open their mouth and say this, homosexuality is sin.
[time=2342] It is deviant, perverted behavior, and therefore there will be no homosexuality is tolerated
[time=2348] in the military, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2350] Because they can't say that, they are reduced to pragmatic arguments which eventually will be overturned, right?
[time=2357] Why can't we have homosexuals in the military?
[time=2358] Well, because it hurts morale and because we can't have homosexuals in the same barrack, well then build two barracks, one for homosexual men and one for homosexual women.
[time=2370] It's a pragmatic argument.
[time=2371] It goes nowhere.
[time=2372] We will eventually be able to oversee or overcome these pragmatic concerns.
[time=2378] Why shouldn't we teach homosexuality to our first graders?
[time=2381] Well, because the arguments are, they're too young.
[time=2385] They don't think about thoughts like that.
[time=2387] Their minds aren't that developed, it's too early, okay, well when are they old enough?
[time=2394] Third grade, at some point they're going to be old enough to think these themes and thoughts through.
[time=2400] There we go.
[time=2402] Why can't we just say homosexuality is a sin?
[time=2405] It's a deviant behavior.
[time=2408] And therefore we are not going to teach it as an acceptable lifestyle to our young people.
[time=2414] See when a country gives up on God, and when a country gives up on the Word of God and moral absolutes, we are, even though we agree with many of these people and hope they are successful, recognize that their arguments are merely pragmatic.
[time=2427] And unfortunately, popular opinion may be swayed and they will lose their battle to hold on to some remnant of morality in public life.
[time=2436] So the point we're making first is that homosexual behavior is a sin.
[time=2441] Number two, homosexuality is a depraved orientation.
[time=2448] Now here I want to talk to this genetic compulsion issue.
[time=2451] I want to talk about people saying I am gay and so I act gay.
[time=2456] This is intrinsically what I am and you can't deny me what I am.
[time=2459] I must have rights.
[time=2461] Well first of all, there is no medical proof to support the homosexual condition as genetic.
[time=2468] There is no physiological differences that are verifiable between heterosexuals and homosexuals.
[time=2474] There is no proof that it is some kind of unique, legitimate physiological orientation.
[time=2480] Just not there.
[time=2481] The medical community can't prove it.
[time=2483] You say, well, what does the Bible say about this?
[time=2486] I mean, does the Bible lean to any credence to the fact that homosexuality is some type of a genetic, inborn thing?
[time=2492] Well, in a way, yes, think with me for a minute.
[time=2495] Homosexuality is a sin, just like any other sin, just like murder, just like rape, just like stealing, just like lying, and just like adultery.
[time=2504] Where does that behavior come from in people?
[time=2507] Their heart, their heart.
[time=2509] We are born sinners.
[time=2511] We are born depraved people.
[time=2513] We are born bent against God.
[time=2515] And as we live our lives, we express that bent against God in a host of different ways.
[time=2520] Some people grow up and become murderers.
[time=2522] Some people grow up and become rapists.
[time=2525] Some people grow up and become very religious and self-righteous and would never do any of those other things.
[time=2530] All of that is an expression of their depravity as they are born into this world.
[time=2535] So in that sense, homosexuality finds its root in the human heart.
[time=2541] I'm not justifying it.
[time=2543] I'm saying that there is a sense in which a homosexual person can honestly look you in the face and say, "I'm almost actual." Just like a murderer can look you in the face and say, "I'm a murderer." Just like a person who struggles with compulsive lying can look you in the face and say from somewhere down deep inside what I am is a liar.
[time=2566] It is a part in a sense of what they are.
[time=2570] Born a sinner with certain bents of depravity.
[time=2574] And you add to that the thought processes that enter their mind and the foolish thinking through which they interpret reality, their own physical attributes, which may lead a person to be a murderer or to be a thief or a person who is exceptionally bright to become kind of agnostic.
[time=2589] There are certain physiological, mental, emotional things that will lead a person to express a bent of depravity in a certain way.
[time=2596] Add to that their environment and the lack of good parenting and godly parents and a godly church and all the things that we need and in a sense they can interpret their reality as I am just intrinsically homosexual.
[time=2610] Freud was onto something when he said that homosexuality is a disorder caused by dominant mothers.
[time=2616] I don't agree with his conclusion but you can see he's tracking the truth of the word of God.
[time=2621] He didn't even know it.
[time=2623] If you don't believe that a good, strong family with a mother and a father functioning according to the divine roles God has given them is essential to raising kids who don't become homosexuals, I don't know what you believe.
[time=2634] That's why we have godly homes.
[time=2636] That's why God established our roles to protect our kids from that kind of stuff.
[time=2640] And when that is not there it leaves a horrible void.
[time=2644] So in a sense Freud was tracking God's reality that parents are the first school of instruction.
[time=2652] And Ellis was onto something when he said that it is genetic because everybody he met with he tracked it back to what was in their heart and who they thought they really were and he was tracking depravity.
[time=2664] He didn't call it that.
[time=2666] He tried to normalize it.
[time=2667] If he would have done his conclusion and come to the right conclusion he would have seen that he tracks a depravity inside the heart of man and when it expresses itself in these people it comes out as homosexuality.
[time=2677] When you add to that a seared conscience you have people who are genuinely saying I was born a homosexual and I am homosexual and they're not lying to you.
[time=2687] They're telling you what they really think and what they really feel and what they really believe.
[time=2692] You don't need to try to take that away from them anymore than when you're talking to someone who is a compulsive liar and they say I'm a liar, you're right, you're a liar.
[time=2702] That's what you are.
[time=2707] You have an inborn depraved bent combined with your life experiences added to your foolish
[time=2713] thinking process has brought you to the place that you are a homosexual committing sinful homosexual acts.
[time=2720] The worst disservice that this society has ever done to homosexuals, one of the supreme tragedies of our time is the declassification of homosexuality as a sin.
[time=2733] Because when we declassify it we cut them off from salvation.
[time=2738] When we say you are normal, when we say what you're going through is natural in the truest ultimate sense of the word, we are saying to them you are just, you are declassified as sin and you are what you ought to be, you can stay that way and live your life.
[time=2752] Instead of saying what you are is you're a sinful human being who has expressed your sinful nature in deviant unnatural behavior, you have thought about it and rationalized it in your mind with your seared conscience and you have committed the behavior and you need to repent, that is a gracious kind and loving thing to say to a homosexual in the context of supporting relationship.
[time=2773] So the bad news is that homosexuality is sin, it's an abomination, it's a perversion, it's abnormal, it's unnatural.
[time=2780] The good news is this and this is point number three, point number three Christ can redeem
[time=2787] homosexuals, Christ can redeem homosexuals and reverse all of that stuff.
[time=2794] I said we go back to 1 Corinthians chapter 6, would you join me there one last time?
[time=2800] 1 Corinthians chapter 6 and this is so exciting.
[time=2804] This is where the church is reminded that we have a place in this society, we are desperately needed in this society.
[time=2812] We have a message of hope and encouragement and life and liberty to bring to these poor
[time=2819] folks.
[time=2820] 1 Corinthians 6 verse 9, start there again, or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[time=2828] Do not be deceived, neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulters nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2839] 1 Corinthians chapter 11 and such were some of you, that's what you used to be, but you
[time=2846] were washed how by the blood of Christ, but you were sanctified, what's that mean?
[time=2851] That means being separated from evil.
[time=2853] You are in the process of being torn apart from those evil practices and evil thoughts and evil ways of viewing yourself.
[time=2859] You were justified, that's total forgiveness in the sight and the eyes of God.
[time=2865] Now in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of our God, the marvelous wonderful message that this church has for the homosexuals of Fort Wayne is that though you feel yourself
[time=2877] to be a homosexual and in some sense that's true, it's an expression of your depravity.
[time=2883] The marvelous news is this, God can change all of that.
[time=2888] As you come into the blood of Jesus Christ, He will change your disposition, your prevailing disposition, He will create a new heart that longs to obey God, that sees homosexuality as sin and as unnatural and as a perversion.
[time=2901] You'll learn to loathe it and hate it and as a converted Christian, you'll see that in you somehow in your flesh and you'll wish it was never there, He can give you a heart to save other homosexuals and to reach out to them with a redeeming love of Christ.
[time=2916] When Jesus Christ died on the cross, when Jesus Christ died on the cross, in His own body, He bore the sin of homosexuals and I don't mean in some generic way.
[time=2927] In very peculiar, specific ways, Jesus Christ bore in His own body the sin of every homosexual
[time=2934] who has ever lived on this planet from the beginning of time in His own body.
[time=2939] That was part of the horror of His crucifixion and when He cried out, "Oh my God, my God."
[time=2946] Eli, Eli, llama, sabachthani, when He said, "How can you turn away from me?
[time=2950] How can we be out of fellowship?" It was because at that moment Christ was bearing the sins of individual homosexuals in His body so He could redeem Him by His grace.
[time=2959] He loves them and He can change their life absolutely and completely in every category.
[time=2965] He can change their prevailing disposition.
[time=2967] He can help them now go back and look at their previous life and all the events that led them to the conclusion that their homosexuals and reinterpret those in light of the word of God, they can now see their life from His perspective and see sin for sin, see the places
[time=2982] these people have been hurt and bruised by society, by the parents, by whatever it was, by a child molester who got them started into the problem, whatever it is Christ can help them look back at it and interpret it in light of His truth.
[time=2995] He can renew their mind for the future.
[time=2997] He can help them have a perspective about their real identity in Christ and how they can serve in the body of Christ and how they can minister to the glory of God.
[time=3005] He can grant them all of that and marvelously by the power of His resurrection power, He can break the bondage of their homosexuality, this burning lust, this burning, consuming,
[time=3017] enveloping lust that demands the kinds of responses we looked at.
[time=3021] He can break that and He can set people free to live godly lives.
[time=3027] That's our Christ.
[time=3028] The magnificent power of Christ willing to bear their sin to set them free.
[time=3036] I love that.
[time=3038] So one, homosexual behavior is sin.
[time=3041] Number two, homosexuality is a depraved orientation.
[time=3046] And number three, Christ can redeem homosexuals.
[time=3052] Now as I close this morning, would you allow me a few more minutes to bring application?
[time=3057] Most of the individual, if you're here today and you're struggling with homosexuality,
[time=3063] maybe you're married and you're struggling with homosexuality, maybe you're single and you're struggling with homosexuality, maybe you've made a profession of faith in Christ and you're struggling with your homosexuality.
[time=3074] May I implore you to go and find yourself a good, strong Christian counselor?
[time=3081] We have them at the Alive Counseling Center in this church and walk in that door and sit down and say, I am struggling with homosexuality and I need your help.
[time=3091] Those may be some of the most liberating words you've ever said.
[time=3094] You need to come out of the closet in that sense.
[time=3097] Be bold enough to say that and seek the help that you can receive with a trained person to look back and work through the issues.
[time=3105] In some cases come to Christ, in other cases find the strength and the stamina to walk in obedience.
[time=3110] And you know, you've been in this church before, I don't just say that to people struggling with homosexuality.
[time=3115] I've said that to people with marriage problems, I've said that to people who are struggling with heterosexuality, that's not some peculiar need, but you are struggling at a level, not
[time=3127] a category, but a level that demands help.
[time=3130] Seek it, find it, get it, you'll never be sorry.
[time=3135] Secondly, to the individual, for those who are not struggling with homosexuality, remember the Jesus principle and be able to separate the sin from the sinner.
[time=3144] Remember that Christ loves these people and died for them as much as He died for you and that your sins were as odious and heinous and harmful to Him when He died as theirs were,
[time=3155] He is our common Savior.
[time=3159] To the family, to the families of Blackhawk.
[time=3164] Let me say this, stay together.
[time=3166] Lay together, love your wife, love your husband.
[time=3173] In a day that Satan has established this cultural trend, he would delight nothing more than to destroy your relationship and allow your kids to go through the pain and the hurt of that and scoop as many of them up as he can and throw them into the plight of homosexuality.
[time=3188] If there was ever a day to stay married and stay strong and to pursue godliness in your marriage, today is the day.
[time=3195] Secondly, within your marriage relationship, fulfill your god-ordained roles.
[time=3201] And that doesn't just happen because you say to yourself, I'm going to fulfill my god-ordained roles.
[time=3205] You men read books, find out good Christian authors and learn what it means to be the husband of your household in loving, concerned, and compassionate leadership.
[time=3213] And you women saturate your minds with the truth of the word of God that calls you to follow and to be submissive and to be the helpmate that God has called you to be.
[time=3222] These are instrumental in the development of the life of your children and how they will lead the next generation.
[time=3229] And then to the family also, as we noted last week, be balanced.
[time=3232] We must hold a standard of absolute purity in our home and that homosexual behavior is sin and that homosexuality is a depraved orientation.
[time=3239] But at the same time, there's got to be enough relationship in that home where there is a child who is struggling with homosexuality and there may be some of our kids that will have that struggle, that they will know and have the confidence that in my parents I will find help and support and strength and love and forgiveness and understanding.
[time=3259] And so together we need to walk that delicate balance between lifting up the standard of holiness and righteousness for our children at the same time, letting them know that if they fail and to meet that standard there is love and support, though there will be much hurt and disappointment.
[time=3272] But you can come to us and we will help.
[time=3278] And lastly to the church.
[time=3280] What does this say to the church?
[time=3282] First of all, I think what this says to the church is that the church must tell the truth.
[time=3286] We have got to tell the truth about homosexuality.
[time=3289] We are compelled for the benefit of the homosexual to tell the truth about homosexuality.
[time=3295] Somebody has got to be willing to stand up and say what is true about homosexuality and there is no better place to do that than the church, this church in this city, to lift high the standard.
[time=3305] Secondly, we need to be like the church at Corinth.
[time=3309] We need to have a whole bunch of people in this church who were effeminate and who were homosexuals but now are not.
[time=3317] We have got to have a heart for these people.
[time=3319] The heart of Christ, this pseudo macho kind of repulsion of homosexuality, I don't believe
[time=3327] that Christ ever responded that way to a homosexual.
[time=3329] Yes, it is unnatural and yes, it is perverted but that does not mean that you recoil in some kind of, oh, you know, the shiver effect, whatever the word and people are mentioned
[time=3340] of that.
[time=3341] There has got to be love, there has got to be compassion, there has got to be understanding, there has got to be an awareness of their hurts and their needs so that we can be a church that is known for its compassion to minister to homosexuals so that though they were that they are no longer that.
[time=3355] They bring glory and honor to God.
[time=3359] You know what that happens?
[time=3360] That happens in this church.
[time=3361] I want to close with just an encouraging note.
[time=3364] This is fantastic story and there are more of these than I know of I believe in our church.
[time=3368] One of our physicians in our church here living and working in Fort Wayne had a patient, a
[time=3374] homosexual patient who was dying of AIDS and in the lengthy death process there were many ailments that could be mitigated by the help of this physician and so he was regularly
[time=3385] in the physician's office seeking help of one kind or another.
[time=3389] And through these visits, this physician built a relationship with this homosexual person
[time=3397] dying of AIDS and pretty soon there was a confidence level that allowed this individual to ask questions about death and about eternal life and about hell and about judgment and
[time=3409] the answers were given with love and compassion and understanding and eventually that individual prayed to receive Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior.
[time=3416] Right there in that office, the most valuable office visit that guy ever had, he received
[time=3423] eternal life.
[time=3425] I was contacted then and had the privilege of going over that individual's house, watching him in the last days of his disease, brought him tapes about the Bible, brought him tapes
[time=3435] by John MacArthur and Chuck Swindall that his eyes were failing and he could no longer read the word of God but he wanted to know about the word of God and learn and listen as much as he could and so Steve Longbreak and I went over and ministered and gave some tapes and then on his very last moments, in his very last moments, that same physician
[time=3454] was able to listen to that same man reaffirm his faith in Christ, the forgiveness of sins
[time=3460] and the repentance of his homosexuality.
