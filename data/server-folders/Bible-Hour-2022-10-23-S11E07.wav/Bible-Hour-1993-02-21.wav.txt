[time=20] Man was created to worship.
[time=25] Intrinsic, into the way in which God made man, built into the very fabric of the creative event when God decided to create Adam and Eve.
[time=34] He built within them the capacity or the desire and the inclination, the willingness to worship.
[time=41] [MUSIC]
[time=58] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=64] Thank you for joining us.
[time=66] The question is often asked among Christians, "Why don't I get more out of the Sunday morning worship service?" The consumer mentality has found its way into the church.
[time=74] The average person in the pew has come to get something from God.
[time=78] But what does the Bible say about the worship experience?
[time=81] Does true worship mean we come to get something or to give something?
[time=85] Today, as we study Revelation chapter 4, past your moral list to several principles, which will be helpful in answering these questions.
[time=93] Our special music will be provided by the Sanctuary Choir in Orchestra
[time=100] and a trumpet duet.
[time=105] Let's now join our service.
[time=109] [MUSIC]

[time=332] Well thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=336] I hope you've enjoyed the music by our Sanctuary Choir and our special guest, the Chamber Orchestra from Cedarville College.
[time=342] We're also certainly thankful for our Christian colleges around the country.
[time=346] They're absolutely essential to train up a next generation of kids that love the Lord and want to serve Him. And of all the Christian colleges I know of, Cedarville is at the top of the list. Paul Dixon, who I know personally and I know you know Paul just does an incredible job building that school with excellence and a level of proficiency to impact and train students for the future. I'm thankful they're here.
[time=370] I'm thankful for the number of students that have gone in particular to Cedarville have come back teaching in our Christian school and have just become a vital part of our ministry here at Blackhawk. So we're grateful they're here and we thank the Lord for the Christian schools around the country.
[time=386] I want to talk to you about the gift offer for this month, the Christian in the face of the enemy. Our pastor Russell Moore has a series of messages on Satan and demonism not too long ago and we've packaged it together for your information.
[time=402] Russell, why would people be interested in this topic? Well I believe it's an essential topic to study and understand what the Bible says about it because it's hard enough to live your Christian life just if you're battling yourself, your own propensity to evil and sin and the weakness of character that you may have. But then when you have confusion about how Satan can interact with that and how his demons can impact you and can they really affect what is going to happen in your life in the next 24 hours? With that confusion you really open a door to more struggle and to more failure and so the series I hope gives some definitive understanding to what a demon and what Satan can and cannot do in the life of the Christian and it really helps I think live more effectively for the cause of Christ. Well thank you and I know that the messages can be very informative for you. There are four messages in this series, each of them almost an hour long and again you can receive the copy of these four messages by writing and asking for the series called "The Christian in the Face of the Enemy" and you can receive it by writing to the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815. We're asking that you send in a donation of $15 to help defray the cost of providing the tapes.
[time=478] Once again that's the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=486] Let's go back now to our live portion of the broadcast as we hear from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=508] [MUSIC - 134 seconds]
[time=646] [APPLAUSE - 4 seconds]
[time=654] been beautifully done. Thank you Gary and Wade and Scott. I want to ask you to open your
[time=661] Bibles this morning to Revelation chapter 4 and as we're turning there I want to say thank you to Tim Teder for the wonderful job that he did as I've heard upon my return and
[time=673] Tim is fast becoming a very very close friend of mine and I have a deep respect for him for his perspective on life and God and for his ability to communicate that and I'm thankful
[time=684] that he was willing to take on the extra workload last week. Heidi and I were on a little vacation
[time=690] that her family provided for us and we had a wonderful time together and we're thankful to be back and involved in our ministry here with you.
[time=699] Revelation chapter 4 and really chapter 5 a little section in scripture that may be one
[time=706] of the most glorious sections in all of scripture about one of the most glorious themes in all
[time=712] of scripture and it is the theme of worship. John has been transported off the island of
[time=720] Patmos by the Spirit of God and he now in these two chapters relates to us a vision that
[time=726] he has seen in heaven and so we'll get a glimpse this morning of heavenly worship but before
[time=733] we do let me set the stage by talking about earthly worship. I came across this kind of
[time=739] humorous little piece of information a few years ago in the Chicago Tribune that reported
[time=745] the story of a New Mexico woman who was frying tortillas when she noticed that in the skillet burns on one of her tortillas resembled the face of Jesus. Excited she showed it to her
[time=757] husband and neighbors and they all agreed that there was a face etched on the tortilla and that it truly bore a resemblance to Christ. So the woman went to her priest to have the tortilla blessed. She testified or that the tortilla had changed her life and her husband
[time=773] agreed that she had been a more peaceful happy submissive wife since the tortilla had arrived.
[time=779] The priest not accustomed to blessing tortillas was somewhat reluctant but agreed to do it.
[time=784] The woman took the tortilla home put it in a glass case with piles of cotton to make it look like it was floating on the clouds built a special altar for it and opened a little shrine to visitors. Within a few months more than 8,000 people came to the shrine of the
[time=800] Jesus of the tortilla and all of them agreed that the face in the burn marks on the tortilla
[time=806] was the face of Jesus except for one reporter who said he thought it looked like former heavyweight boxing champion Leon Spanks. True people will worship almost, I take it back. People will
[time=824] worship absolutely anything. And this morning before we get to our text I want to try to
[time=830] talk about worship by giving you three kind of principles about worship. The first is this, principle number one, man was created to worship. Man was created to worship. He was given by
[time=845] God in the very design of what it means to be human, the capacity to worship. The sense
[time=852] of awe being inspired by something, the ability to have your emotions swept up into something,
[time=860] to have your thoughts captivated by something, the ability to feel a sense of dedication to something, to sacrifice for something. These are all evidences that the human being
[time=871] was created with the capacity to worship. That's just intrinsic to who we are. Number
[time=877] two, principle number two. Because man has created a worshiper, because man has created
[time=884] a worshiper, he will always be worshipping something. He will always be worshipping something. There
[time=892] will never be a moment in his life when he is not worshipping something. We don't have time this morning but we could turn to Romans chapter one and see there that the invisible attributes of God are yelled at all of humanity through creation itself, the things which cannot be seen of God are seen in creation. He's written it upon their hearts and it says there that they reject him, they take the truth and they suppress it about God. They say, "I will not worship God." But their worship experience does not stop. It continues on.
[time=920] They leave God and they start to worship the creation and the creature, because they are incurably religious. In other words, all men everywhere and all of time, because they
[time=932] are created with the capacity for worship, will be busy worshipping something. Maybe
[time=938] you saw the interview with Michael Jackson. We know about Michael Jackson, he's not new
[time=944] to us and what he stands for and all that is about Michael Jackson, but I was again just really impacted when they took away and showed some shots of his tours, his musical
[time=955] tours, his concerts, as he would go from one major city in the world to another. In every case, what they couldn't even call it a building, the outdoor place was absolutely jam packed
[time=969] with a sea of people, thousands upon thousands of people, standing up, swaying to the music
[time=976] and lifting their hands up and not just doing that in some tacit form of approval, but most of them by the character of their life, living out with great dedication, the ethics or the morals or the lack thereof of what he stood for and saying about, they were at that moment expressing their God given ability to worship. And whether you want to worship Michael Jackson
[time=999] or a tortilla or Michael Jordan or a girlfriend or a job or financial security, a car, a house,
[time=1007] TV, sex, feeling good, gratification, whatever you choose, you are constantly in the process.
[time=1014] Martin is constantly in the process of worshiping because he was created to be a worshipper.
[time=1022] Principle number three.
[time=1026] Principle number three is this, misdirected worship, misdirected worship always degenerates
[time=1035] the human existence, misdirected worship always degenerates the human existence, misdirected
[time=1045] worship always degrades a person, it always lowers him, it always cheapens and mitigates
[time=1053] his or her existence, it always diminishes the quality of his life, it always enslaves,
[time=1062] it always destroys and it always leads to death, it always leads to death.
[time=1070] And you might say, wait a minute, now there are certain religions in the world that are
[time=1076] really close to Christianity and they have like their own version of the 10 commandments and so their marriages stay together and they don't murder and they don't cheat and they don't steal and they don't lie and they're honest and you can trust them. What do you mean that kind of worship doesn't really degrade them as opposed to the people who are worshipping the animals and the four footed creature things and all the types of weird stuff.
[time=1098] You're saying, well I would agree there may be some comparative merit in worshipping things that are closer to the word of God than others but the whole package, all of humanity who
[time=1109] chooses not to worship the true and living God is diminished and deteriorated and cheapened and eventually enslaved and destroyed and has led to death both physical and eternal for the very fact that they have chosen to worship something other than the true and living God.
[time=1128] Deuteronomy 6, God said you shall love and that's such an incredible word, it is both
[time=1134] an emotion and it is an action, it is both something you give and something you receive, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, your soul, your mind, your strength.
[time=1146] Man was created to worship because man has created a worshipper, he will always worship
[time=1152] something and misdirected worship will always degenerate his human existence. And so there
[time=1160] we see a sea of humanity frantically pursuing the expression of its innate ability to worship
[time=1167] always fixing it on things other than Christ and God and in that consistently destroying
[time=1175] and deteriorating and tearing down what could have been the quality of life had they chosen
[time=1181] to worship Christ. And that's the world, now you look inside the church and you say what
[time=1187] does worship look like inside the church by we who know Christ, by we who have been redeemed, by we who now have the spirit of God inside of us to illumine the word of God and to energize us towards a fixating gaze upon the person of Christ, are we worshiping like that? And
[time=1204] all too often we find that we use our sense of awe and we are inspired by and we become
[time=1210] emotional about and we are captivated by and dedicated to and willing to sacrifice for
[time=1218] things other than Christ. We like the people in the world have some what of a propensity
[time=1224] and a tendency to want to fix that something inside of us on something less than God himself even though we've been redeemed. And our worship even as Christians even in this church
[time=1236] can be a sense of duty, it can become dry, it can best be described at times with the word obligation to tolerate something until it's over. And so if you're like me, if your
[time=1249] heart is like mine and I'm sure it is you cry out at times for some type of a picture, some type of an example, some type of a refresher on I want to worship God like I was created to worship. And that's what you find in Revelation chapter 4. What you find in Revelation chapter
[time=1266] 4 is a wonderful heavenly scene where God is being worshiped by His holy angels and by
[time=1273] you, the raptured church. Remember this is a prophetic book, this is you in the future.
[time=1279] This is a little glimpse of what tomorrow is for you. And I want us to come to this chapter
[time=1285] with one question in mind. What can I learn from this chapter about true undefiled worship
[time=1294] of God? What is here for me? How can this motivate me and move me and call me and stimulate
[time=1302] me to do more of the kind of worship that John 4 says the Father seeks? I'd like to begin
[time=1311] by just gathering some information about the three principal personalities here. God,
[time=1318] then His holy angels and then the church itself and then having gathered some information
[time=1324] come back and draw some principles from it. Let's begin with God Himself. After these
[time=1330] things it says in verse 1, "I looked and behold a door standing open in heaven and the first voice which I heard like the sound of a trumpet speaking with me said, come up here and I will
[time=1340] show you what must take place after these things. Immediately I was in the Spirit." And
[time=1346] that means He was transported somehow, some way to heaven. And behold, now here it comes about God. Verse 2, "A throne was standing in heaven and one sitting on the throne and
[time=1357] He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardis in appearance. A jasper would be a diamond and a sardius would be a ruby." And there was a rainbow around the throne
[time=1370] like an emerald in appearance. Now verse 5, "And from the throne proceed flashes of lightning
[time=1378] and sounds and peels of thunder. And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God. And before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass like crystal." Let me try to highlight three things about God that just
[time=1397] seem to be obvious. The first is that He is sitting on something and it's a throne. And
[time=1404] if you read this over and over and over like I have suddenly you'd realize that this word throne just keeps coming up and up and up and up and up again. It's used 13 times in this chapter 11 verses the word throne is used. 11 of those times it's used of God's
[time=1418] throne. Two times it's used of the 24 elders' thrones which we'll talk about later. First of all, I think that John is like saying, "Hey look, everything that's going on inside of this chapter is happening with respect to the very throne of God. Track it with me.
[time=1432] In fact, you could outline the chapter this way by the prepositions that are connected to the throne of God. At the end of verse 2, the one sitting on the throne. The end of
[time=1442] verse 3, there's a rainbow around the throne. In verse 4, around the throne were the 24
[time=1451] thrones. Verse 5, "And from the throne proceeded flashes of lightning and sounds and peels
[time=1457] of thunder." Also in verse 5, "Before the throne were the seven spirits of God." Beginning
[time=1463] of verse 6, "Before the throne." Still in verse 6, these angels are in the center and
[time=1471] around the throne. Verse 9 again says, "On the throne," speaking about God. Then verse
[time=1480] 10, "The 24 elders will fall down before him who sits on the throne and will worship
[time=1486] him who lives forever and ever and will cast their crowns before the throne." So it's just
[time=1492] obvious. You can't miss it. The throne is the central piece of furniture. I doubt it.
[time=1501] It may be a piece of furniture, but I'm sure that's not what John is drawing our attention to. The throne of God always represents his sovereign rule in the Word of God. And I could
[time=1512] give you verse after verse after verse 1. May suffice Psalm 103 verse 9, "The Lord has established his throne in the heavens and his sovereignty rules over all." The point here is that the throne of God symbolizes the sovereign authoritative rule of the true living monarch of all the ages. And this is so, so wonderful. Now think about the book
[time=1533] of Revelation with me for a minute. You got chapter 1, you got a vision of Christ, right?
[time=1536] You got chapters 2 and 3, you have the church age. We've studied that, the seven churches.
[time=1541] Now we're going to break our way into what? What is coming and what is coming is the great tribulation and the absolute end of all the age, the destruction of not just the people on the earth, but the earth itself and the atmosphere. And finally in verse 20, God brings down the new heaven and the new earth because he's absolutely destroyed this one and everybody on it.
[time=1563] Chapters 4 and 5 stand as a prologue to that destruction. Chapters 4 and 5 stand as an introductory remark or the setting of the stage for such a cataclysmic catastrophe.
[time=1576] What we're hearing here from the heart of John is God is in control. God is absolutely in control. None of this is going to happen by accident. None of this will be outside of his sovereign plan. The wars that are coming, the famine that are coming, the earthquakes that are coming, when God takes that hail, mixes it with fire and throws it at the earth,
[time=1596] all happen by his sovereign plan. When people are standing some days from now on the edge of the ocean and they see coming out of the sky, something that looks like a huge mountain that's on fire, it will be because God has taken that and is throwing it into the ocean and will turn one third of all the sea into blood. The picture we get is of a God who
[time=1617] is absolutely in the midst of total chaos in complete control. And this is nothing but
[time=1623] the outworking of his sovereign plan from the beginning.
[time=1628] The second thing I see here about God, look at verse 3, there is the issue of this rainbow
[time=1636] and there's the Jasper and the Sardius which are describing his appearance. I don't know what that means. I don't know that we need to know what that means. I believe that's just John tried to explain the unexplainable. He's seeing something. He doesn't know what to say. So he says Jasper and Sardis meaning to a very, very valuable costly brilliant effervescent stones that somehow approximate in some small way the appearance of the living God. But then there is this rainbow. There is a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance. Now, frankly folks, I don't know how a rainbow looks like an emerald.
[time=1668] An emerald is green. A rainbow is all seven colors of the spectrum. So I don't understand
[time=1674] how a rainbow looks like an emerald. But I do understand the rainbow. It showed up for the first time in Genesis chapter 9 after God had absolutely destroyed all the people on the earth. And he gave us a sign, "I will never destroy the earth again with water."
[time=1690] I promise. Look, there's my rainbow. And so it seems almost poetic. It seems pregnant
[time=1697] with meaning that on the brink of the destruction, not just of the people of the earth, but the people and the earth itself that the very sovereign throne that will direct this utter destruction is being surrounded by a rainbow. As if to say, "I have not forgotten my promise."
[time=1714] All of the ages that have transpired since that rainbow until the present have deserved absolute utter destruction. But I have not done that because I promised I wouldn't.
[time=1727] It's almost as if he's also saying, "And by the way, as you see me now prepare to destroy the whole world, don't think I'm breaking a promise." I chose not to destroy the heavens and the earth for a period of time, but from the beginning I knew I would destroy it. You
[time=1742] don't need to turn there, but let me read to you the encouraging words from 2 Peter chapter 3 verses 5 and 9. People are questioning that God would ever bring wrath, and they
[time=1751] say he's so slow. You've been talking about this for millennia. How come God doesn't wipe us out? For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the Word of God the heavens
[time=1762] existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water through which the world at that time was destroyed, looking back to the rainbow, looking back to Noah, being flooded by water. Then it says this, "But the present heavens and earth by His Word are being reserved for what? For fire kept for the day of judgment and destruction
[time=1786] of ungodly men." In other words, the world was originally destroyed by water and now
[time=1792] it's not being destroyed. In fact, it's being kept by the very power of His Word and you say, "What's it being kept for?" Answer, fire. Answer, day of judgment. Answer, destruction
[time=1804] of ungodly men. But notice also, as I continue to read this to you, do not let this one fact
[time=1810] escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day. Now verse 9, "The Lord is not slow about His promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you?" He's very slow about all this. He's very slow to
[time=1827] bring this great day of judgment and fire and destruction. You say, "Why?" Answer, not
[time=1833] wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance. So we see here, beautifully
[time=1842] pictured God upon His sovereign throne saying, "I will control the events of the end of the age. Nothing escapes my notice. I am surrounded by my rainbow, which reminds everybody that I have promised not to destroy by water, but that when I did, I would promise to destroy by fire and destruction. And though I have been slow and though it has been long coming, it has been because I have heart and concern and compassion for the lost. But that period is over now. That period is over now. That time has run out. The third thing I want you
[time=1874] to see about God is in verse 5. And this is consistent with the theme of judgment, which
[time=1880] sets up chapters 6 to 19. "And from the throne proceed flashes of lightning and sounds and
[time=1886] peels of thunder." This is an unbelievable, it's almost like the throne is just kind of sitting there pulsating under the power of its own destructive force. Like one of those great dragsters sitting on a drag strip waiting for the little Christmas tree thing to hit green so it can explode off the line. It just sits there and rumbles. It's just waiting to explode. It's as if God's incredible wrath is just vibrating, waiting to come.
[time=1911] It's an awesome picture. And there were seven lamps of fire that goes on in verse 5, burning
[time=1917] before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. Now this is not the seven lampstands of chapters 2 and 3. This is not the church. These are war torches. If you go to act to Joshua 7 or Nehem 2, you'll find a description of these war torches that would be taken by the nation of Israel when they went and fought. And here the spirit of God, the spirit, the seven spirits of God, the Holy Spirit Himself pictured in the sevenfold ministry of the spirit is representing a war torch. In other words, I'm going to bring my spirit and it will be through Him that I bring this great and awesome judgment upon the earth. He will be active. He will no longer be there to comfort. I will take Him away and then I will use Him
[time=1954] to destroy. So it's an awesome picture of God. We'll come back a little later and try
[time=1960] to draw application as to what that would mean to our worship. But let's move now to
[time=1966] these living creatures. He's odd looking living creatures, verses 6, 7, and 8. He says they're
[time=1973] in before the throne. There was, as it were, a sea of glass like crystal. And in the center
[time=1980] and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind. And the first creature was like a lion. And the second creature was like a calf. And the third creature had the face like a man. And the fourth creature was like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, each of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. And day and night they do not cease to say holy, holy, holy. Is the Lord God the Almighty who was and who is, and who is to come. Again, we don't have time this morning. We could go back to
[time=2011] Ezekiel chapter 1, which is the other great vision of heaven given in the Word of God.
[time=2015] There's another one in Isaiah 6. These are the three great pictures of heaven. Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 1, and here in Revelation 4. Ezekiel 1 would allow us to interpret and clearly understand that these four living creatures are in fact angels and they are of the cherubim class. Not seraphim but cherubim angels. These are the ones who guarded the tree of life after Adam and Eve had sinned. These are the ones who sat above the mercy seat, the ark of the covenant in the holy of holies. They are the protectors and the guardians of the holiness of God. You say, what are we to make of their appearance, lion, calf, man, eagle?
[time=2046] I have no idea. But what is intriguing to me is not just even who they are or what
[time=2054] why they are so described, but what they are doing. Look at verse 8. Again, each of them
[time=2060] has six wings and they are full of eyes around and within. These six wings are exactly the
[time=2067] same kind as we see in Isaiah 6. Their seraphim has six wings and it explains us to it. With
[time=2073] two of their wings they cover their eyes because they can't look upon the glory and the holiness
[time=2080] of God or they'll just instantly expire. And with two of their wings they cover their feet. Reminiscent of our Lord's words to Moses there, take your sandals off, brother.
[time=2091] You're on holy ground. Don't even think about landing here on the crystal sea of my throne.
[time=2097] And the other two wings they use to hover. They are celestial helicopters of sorts and
[time=2103] they use this second set of wings to immediately be dispatched to obey the commands of the living God. We would assume these six wings are used the same way here in Revelation 4.
[time=2115] But notice in verse 8 again the end of the verse and day and night they do not cease to say holy, holy, holy is the Lord God the Almighty. Their message, their song is holy, holy, holy. It's called the song of the tritagion or the song of the seraphim or the song of the cherifim. This is the only attribute, the holiness of God that is repeated three times in a row in all the word of God. It never says love, love, love. It never says power, power,
[time=2141] power. It never says knowledge, knowledge, knowledge. It never says mercy, mercy, mercy.
[time=2145] It never says grace, grace, grace. It always and only says holy, holy, holy. It's the only attribute of all the attributes of God that has reported three times. It is in essence the summing up of all that he is. He is absolutely untainted, undaunted, unaffected, and unimpugned
[time=2161] by sin. He is separate. He is alone. He is away. He is cut apart from sin. And he is also
[time=2167] that way from all of creation and all that he has created. He is transcendent. The word holy means to cut. And it is that he has cut apart from sin and he has cut apart from all that is except himself. He is absolutely the transcending, awesome, holy, pure, righteous God. And that is so hard for people to understand. I was witnessing to an unsafe person this
[time=2189] week. And the question came up that always seems to come up. How can you believe in a
[time=2195] God that allows suffering, that allows hunger, that allows people to die, that allows little
[time=2202] childless children to be molested or even aborted? How can you believe in a God that allows a hurricane to hit the southern part of this country and wipe out indiscriminately thousands of people's lives? How can you believe in a God when there are people starving in
[time=2217] India? What is your problem? How could you possibly believe in that kind of a God that would allow those kinds of things? You know what these angels are doing? These are the
[time=2229] angels that have eyes around and within. They have seen it all. It speaks to their perfect awareness. They have seen all the events of human history. And I believe they see very clearly the events that are about to come. They can see that God is not only going to allow those kinds of things, but in the end of the age, He is going to be the direct, immediate agent of all that stuff. He will wipe out the world. He will kill these people.
[time=2253] He will destroy them. He will bring the plagues. He will destroy it all. They can see what
[time=2259] He has allowed and they can see what He is going to do. And they have one remark about Him, His character, His behavior, what He is. You, oh, awesome God are holy, holy, holy.
[time=2277] There is no salvation. Less a man can say that. In full view of all that God has done,
[time=2286] all that God is going to do. And they know it. They see it. Thirdly, let's talk about
[time=2294] these, what is called these elders. It begins in verse 4, "And around the throne were twenty-four
[time=2304] thrones. And upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting clothed in white garments and
[time=2310] gold crowns on their heads." You say, "Who are these people?" I believe that these are representatives of the church age. These are actual literal people, elders who are representative
[time=2320] of the church age. You say, "Why that?" Well, look at what they're doing. They're sitting on a throne. Do you remember Revelation 3, 21, "The promise to the church at Laodicea?
[time=2329] I will grant you to sit on my throne." What are they wearing? They're clothed in white
[time=2335] garments. Look at 3 verse 18. Chapter 3 verse 18, "I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire that you may become rich and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed, the eyes have to anoint your eyes." Those are
[time=2351] promises that God has given to people, believers, overcomers in the church. In heaven you're going to sit on a throne. In heaven you're going to be clothed with a white garment. And in heaven what? You are going to have a crown. Chapter 2 verse 10, "That you may be tested
[time=2365] and you will have tribulation ten days, but be faithful unto death and I will give you what? The crown of life." So we see these elders, not Old Testament figures, but that
[time=2377] has to be New Testament saints who have led the church who are sitting on thrones as Jesus
[time=2383] promised the church and who are wearing white garments as Jesus promised the church and who have crowns as Jesus promised the church. I think they're the church, representative of the church, you say, "What are they doing?" Look at verses 10 and 11. What are we going to be doing? And when the living creatures give glory, I'm in verse 9, "Glory and honor
[time=2404] and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever." Now verse 10, "The twenty-four elders will fall down before him who sits on the throne and will worship him who lives forever and ever and will cast their crowns before him before the
[time=2419] throne, saying, 'Worthy are thou our Lord and our God to receive glory and honor and power, for thou didst create all things, and because of thy will they existed and were created.'" What are they doing? They're doing two things. This is it. They are falling down
[time=2435] on their face and they are then giving to God the only thing they have to give their crown.
[time=2448] That's worship. "Falling down before God and giving him everything and anything you have
[time=2455] to give." If you were to look at the New Testament a little more closely, you'd find there are two main words that describe worship in the New Testament. The first is Proskeneto,
[time=2468] excuse me, Proskeneto, which means to kiss toward, to kiss the hand of or to bow down.
[time=2474] It's the picture of coming to an earthly king and he puts out his hand and you kneel down and you kiss it. It's revolting to us because we know we only have one person with whom we should do that. That's none other than Christ. But it's the notion of lowering or bowering yourself. The other word is "letruo" and it means to render honor. It means to
[time=2492] pay homage. I want to think about this word for a minute. It means that I'm going to try to give you something that is commensurate with your value or your worth. It's almost
[time=2502] like you move through the Christmas holiday and you have limited funds and you have hundreds of people you like to buy gifts for, but you must pick and choose and you must pick and choose partly by what they would be encouraged by, but who is it that is that valuable to you? Who is it that is worthy of receiving those things which you have saved and you would now spend? Let me tell you, you don't give the gift you bought for your wife to somebody you never met on the street. There is no value there. There are valuables, human beings, but it's your wife who you love and you encourage and you value and you want to show that by the giving of this gift. Worship is the same thing. You're looking at God and
[time=2538] you're asking a question based upon who and what you are, what should I give you to express that? What would it be about me and what I have that would say how valuable you are,
[time=2549] that would say how worthy you are? That's worship. It's absolutely intimidating. The answer
[time=2556] is only one thing, everything. Everything I have, everything I own, everything I am,
[time=2562] you are worth everything. And that is the act of worship and that is what these people are doing. These 24 elders, they only have one heavenly possession, their crown, how they get their crown. They lived a faithful life of service before the king and the king had promised them certain rewards when they got into heaven for their good deeds and so they lived their life. He gave them what he said he would give them, he gave them their reward for their life's accomplishment. They get in his presence, they see who he is, they see his value, they see his intrinsic worth, they fall on their face and give him the only thing they have, everything they have, everything they've worked there, everything they are, their entire life both past, present and future, I worship you. Total surrender to the true
[time=2600] and living God because he is what worthy of it. It's a beautiful picture. God is sitting
[time=2609] on his throne, God is surrounded by his marvelous rainbow which speaks of his awesome plan to
[time=2616] redeem the world for a period of time. His judgment is just thundering underneath him
[time=2622] as it wants to escape and explode on a godless humanity. The angels can see everything, see
[time=2629] what it was, see what it is and they got one thing to say you are awesome, you are holy, holy, holy. And the elders representing the church who are there and getting some glimpse of all that's going on can only do one thing as created human beings that's fall down and give him everything they are. It's a beautiful scene. It's a glorious chapter in the book
[time=2649] of God's Word. Let's go back to our first question. What can I learn about worship from
[time=2657] this chapter? How can I be different? How can I be more effective as a worshiper of God?
[time=2664] If indeed I'm created to worship, if indeed I will always be worshiping something and if indeed misdirected worship destroys my life, tell me how I can be better worshipping God.
[time=2673] Number one and I'll take a one point from each feature, one point from God, one point from the cherubim and one point from the church or the elders, the first from God. And I hope
[time=2685] these seem obvious to you by now. When you come into this place to worship God, come into this place to focus on His sovereign rule of your life and of all the ends of the age.
[time=2698] Come to place yourself under God's sovereign rule. Be gone with any notion of your own
[time=2707] plan for your life. When you come to worship, you come to place yourself underneath the
[time=2713] throne of God, His sovereign rule in your life. You say, "My purposes, my dreams, my activities, my life, total submission to the sovereign rule of God." That's worship.
[time=2730] Principle number two, from the angels, from the angels. It's this, a door of the person
[time=2737] of God, even when you don't like or understand His sovereign rule. A door and worship the
[time=2747] person of God, even when you don't like or understand His sovereign rule. Even when
[time=2754] He's doing things in your life, like taking a loved one or you're losing your job or you're having incredible difficulty with your kids or you're just feeling totally destroyed
[time=2764] and wiped out and you don't like your life and you don't like His plan for it. You don't like what's going on in the country or you don't like what's happening in His sovereign plan. Learn from the cherubim who say, "In light of all that you are and that you've
[time=2779] done, there is but one thing for me to say about you, I will adore you." Job was such
[time=2786] a man. Job loved what God was doing in his life. He was fabulously wealthy. He was godly.
[time=2791] He had character. He had a good reputation. He had a wife. He had kids. He had it all.
[time=2796] And God's sovereign plan for His life was for Him to have none of it save His wife.
[time=2803] And Job's first response to that was, "The Lord giveth, the Lord takeeth away, blessed be the name, the name, the character, the disposition, the plan, all that God is, blessed be the name of the Lord." And we all said, "Hooray Job, good job." But then God left
[time=2820] Him alone in His boils and God left Him alone in the absence of His family and God left Him alone in the absence of His servants and God left Him alone in the absence of His crop.
[time=2827] God left Him alone in God's sovereign plan for His life. And before too long, Job is shaking a clenched fist at the face of God and said, "What in the world are you doing?
[time=2837] I don't deserve this." And he cried out for a courtroom in which he could drag God and
[time=2843] they could defend their case against each other in this presence of a third party who would arbitrate the case. Absolutely unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable that the created being
[time=2855] would question the Creator. And that's exactly what they're saying in verse 11, "We're the our Thou, O Lord and our God, to receive glory and honor and power. Why? For Thou didst create
[time=2865] all things. And because of Thy will, they existed and were created." And that is exactly the place to which God took Job at the end of the book. He said, "I have a question for you, Job, where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?" Just a second here, let me think.
[time=2889] Job, where were you when the stars, the angels, sang to the glory of God when I created all
[time=2896] that is? Where were you? I wasn't there. And finally, he humbled himself in the presence
[time=2906] of God and realized the absolute absurdity of his pretended autonomy to question the sovereign rule of God in his life. And he hit the deck and said, "I had heard of the with the hearing of the eye, but now I have seen the with my own eyes." In other words,
[time=2921] your sovereign plan in my life, as much as I have hated it, as much as pain it has brought, and as much as I would not have elected it, has now instructed me firsthand who you really are. And I will praise you. And I will exalt you. And I will love you. Principle number two
[time=2941] is this, "Adore the person of God even when you don't like or understand his sovereign rule in your life. Never question God. Never be angry with God. Never accuse God. You may
[time=2954] struggle with that. And if you are openly and honestly good for you, as was the case with Joe, but I mean as a genuine character of life, application point number three will take
[time=2967] from our elders. These elders in this passage who represent us, they had clearly found only
[time=2976] one appropriate response in the presence of God, fall down and give him everything." You
[time=2984] and I, we are living today, 1993. That means most of us lived through 1980. That means most
[time=2990] of us lived through 1970. There has never been a generation. There has never been a group of people anywhere on the face of the earth and all of history who has had what you and I have had by way of the absolute consuming commitment to self-gratification. We are the
[time=3010] consumer mentality people of all the ages to date. There may be another generation that exceeds us. But of all the civilizations, it would be America who stands alone in the
[time=3021] 70s and the 80s and the 90s with this incredible commitment to have what I want right now.
[time=3028] We are the consumer mentality. If we don't like it at McDonald's, we go to Burger King.
[time=3034] In other words, we are going to get the highest possible yield on our dollar and if we don't get it, we'll go somewhere else. I'm afraid we may bring that with us to church. I'm afraid
[time=3047] there just may be a sense in which the believers in this country go into their churches every Sunday saying, "God, what am I going to get out of being here?" And if I don't get something
[time=3058] from being here, I may not come back. And if I don't get it at the next church, I won't go there. And eventually I won't go to church at all because I don't come to worship you to give you something. I come for you to give me something. It's a foreign thought to the New Testament. Study it all you want. Study the front to the back, the underside, the oversight. You will never find the concept of worship being that God is giving something
[time=3082] to the created being. It is always the opposite. It is always the created being, seeing God for who He is and saying, "Oh my gosh, you deserve everything." With never a thought,
[time=3095] so overwhelmed by the awesome person of God for what I might get in return. It just so happens that that kind of worship tends to bless the believer. That's a byproduct, friends.
[time=3107] That's an accident. That's a collateral event. What is foremost, what is preeminent, what
[time=3113] is the driving passion of the believer's heart as we peer into the future of heaven is not what I can get from God. It's what I can come bring here and give Him based upon His value and His worth. So we learn from this picture that when I come to worship, I come
[time=3140] to worship to submit myself to the sovereign rule of God. Secondly, I come to adore the
[time=3146] person of God even when that sovereign rule is not to my liking or my understanding. And thirdly, I come to give God glory and honor to praise and to worship Him because of who
[time=3157] He is. The whole thing is about giving to God. I just want to tell you, it is so easy
[time=3168] to forget all that. It is so easy. I'm speaking about Russell Scott Moore. It is so easy
[time=3177] to forget all that and say, God, I want you to be my cosmic genie. I want to whip out
[time=3186] my God a little Aladdin's lamp and I want to set it up here. I want to rub it a few times and I want him to pop out and I want him to say, oh, oh, oh, never had a friend like me.
[time=3198] And I want him to just start doing his deal. Totally committed and at my beck and call
[time=3205] for whatever I want. Oh, my lands. That's sick. That's perverted. That's backwards.
[time=3217] That's wrong. That's trying to make God into some little genie instead of falling down
[time=3227] before Him and saying, you are everything. I am nothing. What possibly can I give you?
[time=3237] That's some token of my minuscule understanding of what you really are. There's a certain
[time=3245] species of ant that lives in some parts of Africa. And as you probably are aware, some
[time=3251] of these species of ants in Africa can build huge massive ant hills, 20 feet tall. But this
[time=3258] particular ant lives in the subterranean tunnels of Africa that they build themselves and go way down into the earth where the young are sheltered. Tunnels where the ants move.
[time=3271] There's a special shelter down there for the queen herself. Now the workers, they'll go
[time=3277] on foraging trips to distant places, returning to the nest with food for the colony and particularly for their queen. It is said by those who study them that if when they are away from their
[time=3289] nest and the queen is molested, these workers, even if they're far away, become very nervous
[time=3296] and uncoordinated. If she is killed, they become frantic. They rush around aimlessly and eventually
[time=3304] die in the field without ever finding their way back to the nest. It's thought by those
[time=3310] who study them that the worker ants in the normal situation are constantly oriented to
[time=3316] the queen by some radar-like device. That's how they know where they are. That's how they
[time=3324] know how to get home. Their whole existence is defined by their connection to the queen.
[time=3331] If she is killed, all orientation ceases, frenzy ensues a frenzy that leads to death.
[time=3340] What a parable of man. What an absolute parable of man. Cut off from God, living in a disoriented
[time=3348] frenzy until he finally dies because he couldn't find his way back home because the one that
[time=3358] gave him direction, the one that set it all in motion, the one that gave perspective to absolutely every event was no longer there. It should give us a sense of compassion, shouldn't
[time=3371] it, for unsafe friends, using this God-given capacity to worship and just frantically running
[time=3378] all around the city of Fort Wayne trying to find something worthy of their worship, all the while completely disconnected to the true one of worship and therefore its fruitless frenzied, it's a death dance, you know, that we could intersect. And isn't it a commentary
[time=3397] on us, though we are saved and could never lose our life in Christ, how in the world
[time=3403] can the church fix its awe and inspiration and emotion and be captivated by and dedicated to and sacrificial for anything other than Christ? It's a good lesson in it.
[time=3422] I hope that you enjoyed the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir and orchestras. They sang a medley of songs praising our Savior. We also enjoyed the ministry of music from
[time=3433] our trumpet duet. The message today was from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore. I'm glad
[time=3439] that we have the opportunity to present the Bible hour to you today and just before we close, if you have a need to accept Christ as your Savior, I'd like to take this moment and pray this prayer with you. Dear Heavenly Father, thank you for this opportunity to
[time=3455] come before you and to tell you that I'm a sinner. And I ask you to forgive me of the
[time=3461] sins that I've committed and come into my heart today and be my Savior. In Jesus' name
[time=3467] I pray, Amen. If you prayed that prayer today, write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3473] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God. To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or
[time=3487] a cassette copy of the series on Satan, Demons and Spiritual Warfare entitled, "The Christian in the Face of the Enemy," please write to the Bible hour, 70, 400 East State, Fort
