[time=0] It is the happily ever after moment of all of history and time and eternity.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=42] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=44] Thank you for joining us.
[time=46] When does it all end?
[time=48] All the pain, all the sorrow, all the sickness, all the death?
[time=53] Who can stop all the suffering, lift the curse and allow us to live happily ever after?
[time=59] Although it sounds a lot like a fairy tale, this wonderful day is actually coming.
[time=64] Today in our study of Revelation 5 we take a look into the future and see the living lamb restore peace and righteousness to the world.
[time=73] Our special music will be provided by the sanctuary choir and orchestra and by the Cedar
[time=82] Building Chamber Orchestra.
[time=88] Let's now join our service.
[time=112] [MUSIC - 190 seconds]
[time=317] [APPLAUSE]
[time=324] Well this has been a very inspiring day as we had the privilege of having the Chamber
[time=330] Orchestra from Cedarville College with us, joining with our orchestra and choir as they sang the great anthem, "Thou Art Worthy." I hope it was an inspiration to you and we're going to be hearing more music from the Chamber Orchestra from Cedarville College in Cedarville, Ohio.
[time=346] There are a number of excellent Christian colleges around the country and we consider Cedarville College to be one of the very fine institutions of higher learning.
[time=355] Many of our students from our church here and in our community go to Cedarville College and we're very thankful for that school and what it represents and certainly we're very happy that they're here with us in our service today.
[time=369] Now last week I just barely mentioned to you a new series that we've put out by our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=375] It's called "The Christian in the Face of the Enemy" and it's a series of messages that he did a few months ago and we've put them on four cassette tapes.
[time=385] The sections of these messages, the part one is Satan's Demons and Spiritual Warfare, Satanism
[time=392] and Demonism, Demonism and The Christian and finally, can the believers be oppressed?
[time=400] A very fine series that you can receive by writing to the Bible Hour today at 7400 East
[time=407] State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=413] Once again, just write to the Bible Hour and ask for the series of tapes on Demons.
[time=418] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=424] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=427] We are suggesting that you enclose $15 or more to help defray the cost of providing
[time=433] these tapes.
[time=436] We're very appreciative of the letters that you've written in recent weeks about the messages from our pastor/teacher Russell Moore.
[time=443] They've been very timely and they've been helpful in the face of some of the enemy that we experience in the world concerning homosexuality, abortion and issues of that nature.
[time=456] And Pastor Moore has been very enlightening as what the Scripture says about them.
[time=461] We're going to go back to the live portion of our service now with more music from the Chamber Orchestra from Cedarville College.
[time=495] [MUSIC - 150 seconds]
[time=655] [APPLAUSE]
[time=665] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=885] [APPLAUSE]
[time=909] Amen. Thank you. Good night. It's good to see some college kids again. From my days at the Master's College, thank you for coming all the way out from Cedarville, a marvelous Christian college. Lord is blessing Paul Dixon and all his faculty and staff. Thank you, Catherine. Well, if you'll take your Bibles this morning, let's open to Revelation chapter 5. And if you're with us for the first time today, or you're a visitor, or someone who wants to be here, you're going to be able to be here.
[time=935] And if you're with us for the first time today, or you're a visitor, or haven't been with us for a while, we're studying through the book of Revelation, and we've come across two magnificent chapters that usher us into the very throne room of God in heaven, chapters 4 and 5 of Revelation. We looked at chapter 4 last week, and we'll look at chapter 5 this week.
[time=955] We saw last week that God was on His throne, and He was surrounded by angels, four angels, each having six wings, and they were singing a marvel, a song of praise and adoration and glory to God. Holy, holy, holy.
[time=969] Around the throne were 24 other thrones, the thrones of the elders, and they represent the church, the raptured church that you and that's me after the rapture were found in heaven represented by these elders, and they also are worshiping God.
[time=983] They are falling prostrate on the floor before Him, casting their crowns in the only acceptable act of worship they could possibly give to sing worthy art thou, our Lord and our God.
[time=996] And really, we don't need a chapter break between 4 and 5. There's no need for it, because it's the exact same scene. We haven't gone anywhere. John is still telling us what He is seeing and what He's experiencing in this heavenly vision.
[time=1010] And really, to my surprise, this week as I studied this, I learned so much in my study, and this week I noticed something that I had never noticed before.
[time=1019] This is really the apex of praise and worship and glory and adoration to the person of Jesus Christ in all of history and eternity.
[time=1029] Chapter 5 brings this marvelous person of Jesus Christ, seen here as the living lamb, into center focus, and He has worshiped at a level and with a magnitude and a scope that He has nowhere else revealed to be worshiped in all of holy writ.
[time=1047] Let me show you that. Start in chapter 4, and notice the worship begins as a quartet.
[time=1052] Really, it's just these four living creatures. And in chapter 4 verse 8, they just alone break out in praise. Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty who was and who is to come.
[time=1065] But then it begins to build momentum, and it kind of incorporates now in verses 10 and 11 of chapter 4, the 24 elders. And so now it's 28 people, or 28 beings that are giving praise.
[time=1076] They say in verse 11, "The art thou, our Lord and our God." The scene continues, and the momentum builds and the worship escalates until you come to verse 8 of chapter 5.
[time=1088] And you'll see there that the same four living creatures and the 24 elders are joined together, but they add to their chorus, the harp, or the stringed instrument.
[time=1099] And so they add to their own voices instruments to fill out the sound and to escalate the sense of worship that they are having, and they in verse 9 sing a new song, "Worthy Art Thou" to take the book.
[time=1113] But it grows even beyond that. In verse 11, I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
[time=1121] And the number of them was Myriads of Myriads and thousands of thousands. Myriads, by the way, in the Greek language is the largest name they have for the largest number they would count.
[time=1132] Without calculator or computer, they would stop counting at 10,000. That was all they could take time to count.
[time=1139] And so the largest name they had for that was Myriad, that meant 10,000. So what they're saying is our largest number times our largest number, or 1,000 times thousands. There are literally millions of angels now that have joined the choir. This is now a Peter Kobe Choir.
[time=1154] This is big, see? They're great numbers. They've got the orchestra and they're large. And they're loud.
[time=1161] Verse 12, some of you say, "Man, the music's too loud." Well, you ain't seen nothing yet. Wait till you get to heaven where God likes it loud. He does.
[time=1171] Verse 12, "Saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing." And that, of course, was the great anthem that they sang to us this morning.
[time=1182] But it goes beyond even that. It takes a step further to verse 13, "In every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them I heard singing." That's, folks, that's everything that's ever been created.
[time=1198] It now bursts forth in praise. Those things under the earth, I don't know what that means. Maybe that's the gophers that live there. On and in the sea, the fish, the whales, the dolphins, the sharks, everything you can imagine, the water itself.
[time=1213] Everything just bursts forth in one great pay-on of praise to the worthy one, the living lamb. And they say to him who sits on the throne to the lamb be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.
[time=1226] Now, there may be more praise somewhere else in the Bible, but it's not recorded. This is the apex. This is the pinnacle. This is the height of the glorious worship, not just of the fore and the 24 and the harps, not just of all the angels.
[time=1241] This is it. This is all of creation. Every created being, every created thing giving glory and worship and praise and honor to Christ.
[time=1251] And I really feel inadequate. Some passages seem to preach better than others, and this passage we need to call up Disney, and we need to say to them, we need all of your orchestration, we need all of your animators, we need all of your talented voices, we need all of your power to try to help us visualize what is going on here.
[time=1268] And I believe if they were to do that by the Spirit of God, we would get a better picture. Because this is really happily ever after in the Bible.
[time=1277] This is the happy ever after moment. This is the drama of any great fairy tale. And I want to try to look at it maybe even a little bit from that vantage point.
[time=1288] To help us get a sense of the wonder and the splendor and the glory of Christ. What do you need to have a good happily ever after moment?
[time=1297] We need a couple things. First thing you need is a villain, right? You've got to have a bad guy or a bad witch or a bad person, someone who is full of vile and is full of hatred and is selfish and vain and is seeking to destroy and to lie and to deceive and to murder.
[time=1316] Much as Snow White's wicked stepmother who when she asked the mirror on the wall, mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most beautiful one of all.
[time=1325] And finally the mirror said, it's not you, sister. She just become outraged that there was another who could have her glory.
[time=1332] And so she changed herself into that ugly little peddler woman and showed up on the doorstep of the seven dwarfs and talked little Snow White into taking a bite out of the apple.
[time=1340] And then comes the second part that you must have for a happily ever after moment and that is a curse, no curse, no happily ever after.
[time=1349] And of course the curse that took Snow White by storm was to put her to sleep.
[time=1354] Then she lay there lifeless and helpless and she was robbed the privilege of life, the wonder of life.
[time=1361] But then of course the scene is then set for the hero.
[time=1367] The hero to come, the majestic one, the marvelous one, the prince who rides upon his noble white steed who though in the struggle to win and overthrow the evil one in the curse,
[time=1378] though there may be moments of hopelessness, though there in fact a really good fairy tale there will be a sense of loss where even the hero himself is going to be defeated.
[time=1386] And our hearts are filled with fear that it will never be reversed and the evil one will never be overthrown.
[time=1392] But then just at the last second the hero comes through, the hero wins, the hero is victorious.
[time=1400] And he overcomes the evil one, he overthrows the curse and then everybody lives.
[time=1407] How? Happily ever after.
[time=1410] That's it folks and that's what this chapter is all about.
[time=1413] And I'm really convinced as I study it and as I learn more about life, that this is the place, it's the scope of redemptive history, it's God's tale if you will,
[time=1425] from which all the other fairy tales take their component parts.
[time=1429] And I notice in myself the more I know about life and the more I know about the Bible that when I'm watching these fairy tales on television or reading them in books or telling them to my kids as I make them up in my own mind as they lay there and try to fall asleep,
[time=1442] that it's at that moment of victory, it's at that moment of finally when good triumphs over evil, that I'm far more emotional about it now than I was a kid.
[time=1453] Something in me wants this, something in you wants good to triumph and all the pain and the sorrow and the emptiness and the heartbreak and the death to be done with forever and for once and for all for the right to triumph.
[time=1468] And this is that moment, this is that glorious moment in heaven when Christ writes all the wrongs.
[time=1476] And let's look at it this morning.
[time=1480] We begin in verse one with this simple thing, it should say maybe once upon a time but it can't because it's a true story, it's not fiction, it's not a fairy tale, it's reality, yet future.
[time=1491] Chapter five verse one and I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne of book written inside and on the back and sealed up with seven seals.
[time=1501] The backdrop of course to this is our evil one, he is our villain, he is none other than Satan, the created angel that went awry, that said in his own heart I will have the place of God.
[time=1511] And when he couldn't have it was thrust down to earth and John 14 and John 16 tell us that Satan is the ruler of this world.
[time=1519] He is that diabolical sinister liar, hater, murderer that is running under the permission of God, all that occurs on this planet.
[time=1528] And he is a true villain and he has with him his demonic host and he has with him all the men on this planet who would find allegiance with his way and his thinking and his purposes.
[time=1538] And of course there is a curse that sets upon the world today that you and I experience every single moment of every single day, the world is cursed, God cursed the world in response to the sin of Adam and Eve.
[time=1551] And it's not limited to people, the curse is on creation itself, Romans chapter 8 tells us that creation groans and suffers under the pains of childbirth.
[time=1562] In other words it's waiting for its great redemption, the earth itself was cursed back in Genesis when God responded to the sin of Adam and Eve.
[time=1571] The fact that the lion would eat the lamb is a sighting of the curse. The fact that we fear that our children would be touched or bitten fatally by a snake is an impact or a consequence, an evidence of the curse.
[time=1587] Isaiah the great prophet back in chapter 11 sees a vision of the millennium, this marvelous new day that is being inaugurated here in Revelation chapter 5 and it sees what it will be like and he describes the uncursed earth.
[time=1600] Listen to what he says, the wolf will dwell with the lamb and the leopard will lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together, the fatling together and the little boy will lead them.
[time=1613] Also the cow and the bear will graze, their young will lie down together and the lion will eat straw like ox and the nursing child will play by the whole of the cobra.
[time=1625] And the wean child will put his hand on the vipers den, they will not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the lords as the waters cover the sea.
[time=1638] He's describing a glorious, wonderful day when the earth will no longer be under the curse and it will be different than it is today.
[time=1646] Marvelously wonderfully different, everything will be at peace and at harmony with itself, everything you never wanted, everything you could hope for in a fairy tale, it will happen.
[time=1654] And it will not only impact the creation itself or the earth, it will impact us and we look at ourselves and we look at fellow men and we see that we are under the curse, horribly under the curse.
[time=1665] We are disfigured by sin.
[time=1669] It is not so much our physical shape that is disfigured, though I don't believe we have the same splendor that we had in the Garden of Eden prior to sin, but what is predominantly disfigured about us is our will and our heart and our thinking.
[time=1680] And we're warped and we're turned away from God and we're turned against each other and there is devouring and biting and bickering and selfishness and outright hatred which spawns war as we lust and cannot have.
[time=1694] So we are disfigured by this curse and even our physical bodies evidence it as we watch ourselves grow older, we look in the mirror and we see the gray that is there that was not there, not too many months ago.
[time=1708] We see the wrinkles begin to take shape, the body begins to deteriorate and we know that we are in the process of paying the consequences of the curse, namely death.
[time=1718] And we go to our hospitals, not too many weeks ago there were some 23 people from Black Hawk Baptist Church at Parkview for one ailment or another.
[time=1727] Some more severe than other and we battle cancer and we battle heart attacks and all kinds of different diseases and it all is an evidence that we are cursed and that we are under the curse.
[time=1738] And we want to be relieved and the relieving scene begins with this book.
[time=1745] Chapter five verse one there is a book better maybe a scroll and it's written on the inside and on the back sealed up with seven seals.
[time=1755] In other words there's a piece of parchment or animal skin and written on the inside of this is how the world will be returned to its original design.
[time=1766] How God it's like a title deed of how God will give the earth back to its rightful owner.
[time=1772] And written in this book are the seven seals and that's all the judgment that is unveiled for us in Revelation chapter six through nineteen.
[time=1780] It is the how that God will give back the earth to its rightful heir and owner Jesus Christ.
[time=1787] And all that is written up and a certain amount is written and then it's rolled over and sealed shut on the edges.
[time=1792] So more is written and it's rolled a little more and it's sealed again and then more is written seven times this revealing of how it will all be taken back by Christ and then a seal for each time seven seals and all.
[time=1802] And on the outside there's writing and that is a summary we believe of what would have been on the inside.
[time=1807] It was true of ancient documents that were sealed that you couldn't see in at all that they would then run on the outside of the document something of a summary of what would be inside.
[time=1816] So there is this marvelous, marvelous scroll and it is the title deed to the earth.
[time=1822] It is how the earth will be brought back and it's been around for a while.
[time=1826] If you were to read Ezekiel chapter two you would see the scroll there and it has whoa and mourning and heartbreak written all over it and Ezekiel desires to see more about the scroll but God says no and seals it up and says it's not for this time it's not for this place and it's not for you Ezekiel.
[time=1844] And it was also referenced in Daniel chapter 12 another great prophetic book of the Old Testament where Daniel was getting revelation about the end of the age and how all this was going to wrap up.
[time=1852] But there was so much more he wanted to see and so much more he wanted to learn about and God sealed it up.
[time=1859] And so while the earth has been under the rule of the usurper this monarch Satan and his destructive force and power all the while in the hand of the God of the universe has been the title deed to the earth.
[time=1873] And he now at this appropriate moment sitting on his throne anthropomorphically in other words to give God human features he opens his hand and sitting in the hand of God is this marvelous scroll and it waits for someone as you see in verse two.
[time=1889] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice there it is again loud.
[time=1901] Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals and no one in heaven on earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.
[time=1910] The strong one or strength of God it may be Gabriel but the strong mighty angel stands and then heralds a question that penetrates every corner of the universe.
[time=1921] In the graves of earth upon the sands and the seashores and the mountains of earth and all into the galaxies everywhere this angel's voice echoes with this marvelous question who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals.
[time=1935] In other words who is worthy to take back the earth who is worthy and able to return the earth to its original condition.
[time=1945] And it says in verse three no one no one in heaven that would have been Adam and Moses and Noah and Abraham and Joseph and Elijah and Daniel and Ezekiel no one in heaven and none of the angels not Gabriel not Michael or any others that were there
[time=1963] none of them even stirred no one in heaven or on the earth anyone remaining anyone alive or under the earth anyone caught and she all anyone in hell was able to open the book or to look into it.
[time=1982] All great would be rulers of the world sat absolutely motionless Alexander the great Hitler.
[time=1990] Genghis Khan Lenin Stalin none of them moved a muscle the entire universe is caught still by the question who is worthy to open the book and break its seals.
[time=2005] Therefore look at John's reaction to that and I began to weep greatly because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it.
[time=2016] It overwhelms John with a sense of grief.
[time=2019] John is as tired as we are of the curse.
[time=2023] John is tired of Satan. John is weirried by his demon forces. John is weirried by the false doctrines that send people to hell and the sense of hopelessness and seeing little children being mistreated and abused and seeing people die of various diseases and
[time=2039] he's just tired of watching the earth languish under the curse that it has befallen it he just wants the difference he wants it to be renewed he wants Christ to come he wants the power of the evil when destroyed.
[time=2051] He wants retribution on those who have hated and crucified Christ he wants Israel to be restored to the land he wants Christ to reign and so he weeps he weeps greatly.
[time=2067] W.A. Criswell a great preacher of our generation once said this about the tears of John in this passage these represent the tears of all God's people through all the centuries.
[time=2077] Those tears of the Apostle John are really the tears of Adam and Eve driven out of the Garden of Eden as they bowed over the first grave as they watered the dust of the ground with their tears over the silent still form of their son Abel.
[time=2091] Those are the tears of the children of Israel and bondage as they cried unto God and their affliction in slavery.
[time=2097] They are the tears of God's elect through the century as they cried unto heaven.
[time=2102] They are the sobs and the tears that have been rung from the heart and soul of God's people as they looked on their silent dead as they stand beside their open graves as they experience in the trials and sufferings of life heartaches and disappointments indescribable.
[time=2116] Such is the curse that sin is laid on God's beautiful creation and this is the damn nation of the hand of the one who holds it.
[time=2123] That usurper that interloper that intruder that alien that stranger that dragon that serpent the Satan devil and so John weeps.
[time=2135] He fears in his heart that should one not be worthy to come and take then all that is would remain as it is.
[time=2142] That the earth would remain under its curse that people would continue to live feudal lives and die and be sent forever to hell.
[time=2148] There would be no one to overcome Satan, his demons sin, death and hell.
[time=2155] And so he weeps.
[time=2158] But there is in verse 5 one of the elders.
[time=2163] One of those of the 24 we assume, one of those representative of the redeemed and they said to me stop weeping.
[time=2171] Behold, look, understand, realize there's hope.
[time=2177] The lion that is from the tribe of Judah, the root of David has overcome so as to open the book and its seven seals.
[time=2185] The lion, it is the lion from the tribe of Judah, the lion tribe.
[time=2190] It is an Old Testament messianic term for Christ.
[time=2193] Genesis 49.9 describes him as a lion.
[time=2196] It's his fierceness, his devastation, his strength, his power, his destructive awesome presence.
[time=2203] That of a lion who overcomes and devours its prey.
[time=2207] Stop weeping John.
[time=2209] There is a lion that is from the tribe of Judah.
[time=2213] And he is also of the root of David, which means this lion has blue blood.
[time=2217] He is royal through and through.
[time=2219] He comes from the Davidic lion which he must have come through to be the Messiah.
[time=2224] And he has overcome.
[time=2227] And so John I'm sure with great anticipation wiping the tears from his eyes and beginning to look up to see this marvelous one, this awesome lion, this one, the root of David turns probably around behind him to look.
[time=2240] And instead of seeing a lion, he sees a lamb.
[time=2244] Verse 6 and I saw between the throne with the four living creatures and the elders a lamb standing as if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God.
[time=2253] Sin out into all the earth.
[time=2256] Lamb.
[time=2258] Described as a lion but seen as a lamb.
[time=2261] Arneas in the Greek, not just the term for lamb as in some general lamb.
[time=2265] Arneas means little lamb, little baby lamb.
[time=2269] And it's a throwback to the Passover where God required before the Passover be observed that the father move into the marketplace or into his own herd and find there a little lamb.
[time=2280] And Arneas, a little baby lamb that defenseless, helpless, pure, spotless, undefiled lamb.
[time=2288] Select it or buy it and then bring it not to be held in a pin outside the family home but bring it into the very residence of that family and let it eat and sleep with the family and be held and coddled and loved and appreciated and affections were built with that little Arneas, that little lamb.
[time=2304] Because God knew that what would be sacrificed on the cross was the precious lamb of God, his own son, his beloved one.
[time=2310] Not some distant removed Savior who was never known or never loved or never appreciated but what God would offer up on the cross was the very one he had cradled in his own bosom.
[time=2321] Little Arneas, the little lamb, Jesus Christ.
[time=2325] And he has seen there interestingly as standing as if slain.
[time=2331] He is slain, the lamb has been slain and of course this is a marvelous picture of his crucifixion and even we picture him here now in glory in heaven on the edge of the millennium and of the eternal heaven and earth.
[time=2344] And he is still pictured as being slain.
[time=2347] You know what that means?
[time=2348] Christ came on Christmas and took the form of human flesh and he's still in it.
[time=2353] He'll never shed it.
[time=2355] When Christ came to die for you and me it meant becoming man and man he will stay in the marks of humanity, the marks of sin, the marks of his crucifixion, the nail pierced hands, the pierced feet, maybe still the scars around his breast, the wounded, his forehead, the wounded breast.
[time=2372] It's all still there.
[time=2373] It's all still visible in glory.
[time=2375] You'll see it when you get there.
[time=2377] You'll see your slain Lord.
[time=2379] He will bear the marks of his crucifixion to you.
[time=2384] But notice also he's standing.
[time=2387] It's a marvelous picture of his resurrection.
[time=2389] The little lamb is not laying there on its side, gasping for air, kicking its feet in the last desperate moments of rigamortis before it dies.
[time=2397] It bears the mark of being slain but it stands.
[time=2401] It stands because Christ was resurrected from the dead.
[time=2405] He's alive.
[time=2407] He's ready to do his father's bidding once again.
[time=2410] So there is instead of a lion this marvelous, intimate, loving, saving lamb who is the sacrifice and who bears the marks of his sacrifice but yet is standing.
[time=2423] And now pictured ready to do his judgment he's seen as having seven horns.
[time=2427] This little lamb has seven horns and of course horns in the scriptures are always representative of the animal's power.
[time=2434] And seven is the perfect number he has complete power he has perfect power to do his work.
[time=2440] And seven eyes he has perfect knowledge perfect enlightenment and that pictures the spirit of God the Holy Spirit who is sent out into all the earth.
[time=2448] In other words this lamb now ready to execute judgment on all the earth and all who would fail to worship him and all who would reject him in Revelation 6 through 19 has perfect power with which to do it in the perfect knowledge.
[time=2460] No one will be overlooked no one will be missed no judgment will be miscalculated everything Christ does in fact everything Christ has ever done will be absolute perfection in his judging of all the world.
[time=2474] And so we go from the hopeless point in John's heart that the wrongs will never be righted no one will ever be strong enough no one will ever come and take the scroll no one will ever take the world back from the power of Satan and death and sin and the curse and hell and damnation
[time=2489] and he's weeping greatly but all of that is resolved for him as he looks emerging out of the throne it's in verse six I saw between the throne.
[time=2500] So somehow in the midst of the throne in between the throne and around the throne this glorious crystal sea like glass and this throne upon which God sits in enshrined there as as a sardius arubian a diamond and these flashing peels of thunder
[time=2516] and and these these heavenly angelic beings hovering with their six wings and their their pay on of praise holy holy holy and the twenty four elders falling off of amidst all of this emerges somehow he sees in and through it and there is this lamb
[time=2532] this little lamb standing as if slain with seven horns and seven eyes you say what does he do what does the lamb do well in my Bible you turn the page
[time=2545] in yours you go to verse seven it says there he came the lamb came and he took it he took what he took the scroll he took the title deed
[time=2557] he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne Christ comes and he removes the scroll he takes it to himself he says I am the worthy one in effect
[time=2567] I am the one who is able to overthrow Satan and demons and sin and death and the curse and turn it all back to the way it's supposed to be I am the worthy one
[time=2577] and of course as I pointed out to you then all heaven breaks loose with this marvelous song of praise verse nine worthy art thou to take the book and to break its seals
[time=2589] you're the one you're the only one and all of heaven and earth and under the earth who was worthy to take the scroll and to break its seals why are you so worthy for you were slain
[time=2600] and you did purchase for God with thy blood men of every tribe and tongue and people and nation it's a marvelous thought think of it from John's perspective for just a minute
[time=2613] every tribe means every descent every lane every lineage every tongue means every language every language it was ever spoken every people means every race of humanity
[time=2627] and every nation of course means same culture so from every descent from every language from every race from every culture that has ever been you are the worthy one who has drawn to yourself those you would save out of those people
[time=2642] John's exiled on patmos Jerusalem has been destroyed some 20 years previous to this all of his friends in the apostles have been martyred by now
[time=2657] the church is is being scattered abroad it's under incredible persecution the days of Pentecost are long gone when three and then four thousand people would be saved in a very preaching of the word
[time=2670] Paul has run his gauntlet through asian had great expansion but when it was all said and done Paul himself said all who are in Asia have turned away the church is in disrepair the church is persecuted the church doesn't have any leadership
[time=2683] the church is thrown and scattered and ripped and torn by the evil one himself when John sees this and yet he sees down through the annals of history and in the song that we read there in verse nine he realizes that every
[time=2697] tribe and every tongue and every people in every nation will feel the touch of the lamb who was slain all of this is not for not and so he has great heart and great hope
[time=2716] and really these can't be preached on these great songs of praise I they just stand alone they defy preaching they just need to be read and bast in and allow them to express your own heart and your own passion but notice in verse fourteen
[time=2730] as if the elders had been up at all to sing their song they then hit the deck again the four living creatures kept saying amen in other words amen so be it let it be let it happen this is wonderful they just say that over and over and over again and the elders fall down and worship God
[time=2745] they got up just long enough to sing them a song and then they just boom hit the deck to prostrate themselves before the worthy word
[time=2755] so this is it this is it when Christ comes and takes the scroll the apex of recorded praise breaks loose and all that's left is for him to enact his judgment as the seven seals are opened
[time=2774] and at the end of those seven seals he establishes his millennial kingdom that thousand year reign when Christ will actually literally reign on earth he will be here in physical form and he will reign
[time=2787] and the earth will be the benefactor of his blessed reign of righteousness and peace and as we read from Isaiah 11 the lion will lay down with the lamb and the little baby will be able to touch the snake with no harm
[time=2799] and finally once and for all this world will be at peace the bad guy will be thrown into the lake of fire the villain the curse will have been lifted and totally removed and reversed
[time=2816] the great hero Jesus Christ will have brought to himself both his bride the Christ excuse me the church and Israel and then all of us will live happily
[time=2828] ever after all because of the worthy one without Christ none of that happens without Christ none of that happens without the person of Jesus Christ all of us stay in a cursed condition for eternity
[time=2846] there is this one splendid person named Jesus just as we close this morning and by way of application I want to talk about how you can be like Christ
[time=2860] when I first came to Christ some years ago the kind of the buzz phrase inside of Christian circles for discipleship and training was to be Christ like
[time=2868] and that's a good term that's a good phrase that's accurate Romans chapter 8 tells us that we were predestined to be conformed to the image of his son this whole thing for us coming to Christ and living our lives is one inexorable movement of the power of the spirit of God to make us completely conformed to the person of Jesus Christ
[time=2885] as we look at chapter 5 there are some things about Christ we cannot emulate we cannot be Christ like in so many ways we certainly can't make a move for the scroll I mean that would be absolute insanity totally disrespectful out of place
[time=2904] we will like everyone else in the universe sit absolutely motionless in response to the angels beckon who is worthy to open so we can't be like him in that regard we certainly can't be like him in that we are worthy of the praise and the accolades that dominate this chapter
[time=2920] those are not for us never will be those will always be for Christ and Christ alone but I want you to notice in verse 6 there is something there that really ought to look like us
[time=2932] there's really something there that we can grab ahold of and say this is how Christ was this is how I ought to be this is how I want to be like the worthy one
[time=2944] notice there I saw between the throne with the four living creatures and the elders a lamb standing as if slain
[time=2955] there's an interesting order to the life of Christ Christ was first slain and then he stood and so it should be with us it says in John chapter 12 let me just read it to you
[time=2975] the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified truly truly I say to you unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies it remains by itself alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
[time=2989] he who loves his life loses it he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to life eternal if anyone serves me let him follow me and where I am there shall my servant also be if anyone serves me the father will honor him
[time=3006] as true as there is a law of gravity that you cannot see but it governs all the physical universe or at least the dimensions of this earth that if you get up on a tall building jump off you will fall absolutely certain that is a law of gravity it cannot be violated
[time=3022] there is a law in the spiritual dimension and it's this first you die and then you live first you die and then you live
[time=3030] first you become like a grain of wheat that's fallen to the ground and dies how do I die physically no Roman chapter 12 tells us to be a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to God
[time=3044] Jesus Christ in his time here on earth died it was one long death march to the cross it was one long abdication of his own rights of his own desires of his own longings of his own everything he ever wanted he gave it up
[time=3056] though he was tempted in Matthew 4 by Satan to have the world prematurely and to have the kingdoms of the world he walked steadfastly in love and compassion concerned more for the interests of others than for his own needs
[time=3071] there is no way to violate that order in Christendom as it was first for Christ to die and then to stand and live so it is for us we must purpose in our heart to live a self sacrificing life here on earth
[time=3089] this is not the place where we get what we want planet earth whatever the address on your street is whatever the name of your city is this is not the place to receive what you want
[time=3103] the clear unmitigated message of the life of Christ and all of scripture says this is the place to die it is now it is here where we give up our rights it is now it is here that we live sacrificially for other people
[time=3120] it is now it is here that our own needs may go unmet so that we can meet the needs of other people
[time=3127] the picture of that is of Abraham who in Hebrews chapter 11 was said to have never received the promises of God while he was on earth
[time=3139] he wandered as a stranger and as an alien never really receiving the possession that God would have given him
[time=3147] because he was hoping for a better city he was hoping for the city whose architect and builder is none of it in God
[time=3153] Abraham lived his entire life never really possessing the promised land for which he left er because he was giving glory and honor to God representing God there
[time=3163] and he knew that when he was in heaven he would have all the promises of God fulfilled
[time=3170] so we should be like Christ and that we should be slain first and live later
[time=3178] be slain first and live later secondly and it is really along the same line look at verse 5 Revelation chapter 5
[time=3188] one of the elders said to me stop weeping behold the lion that is from the tribe of Judah the root of David has what he has overcome
[time=3198] the word is Nike in the Greek overcomer sound familiar at the end of every single one of the seven letters to the seven churches
[time=3209] back when we were still on earth he said to us be an overcomer be an overcomer what does that mean how was Christ an overcomer
[time=3220] Hebrews chapter 12 says that Christ was an overcomer because he faithfully followed obedience all the way to death
[time=3229] he never opted out he never said that is enough obedience he never said this is too painful this is too emotionally distressing this is unreasonable
[time=3237] this is uncalled for to obey God is just too much heartache he never removed himself from the long line of faithful obedience
[time=3246] he overcame through his faithful obedience the words of Hebrews chapter 12 say to us the same thing fix your eyes on Jesus
[time=3255] the author and perfecter of faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God
[time=3265] for consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself so that you may not grow weary and lose heart in other words he overcame all the way to having endured the cross
[time=3277] so said you the verse goes on you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood and you're striving against sin
[time=3286] strive against sin never stop striving against sin be an overcomer be like Christ
[time=3294] no you're not worthy to take the scroll and no you're not worthy of the praise but yes you're worthy to live a self sacrificial life now to die now to obey
[time=3303] and to overcome all the way to the point of your own physical death now for when you do there is a life after this one
[time=3310] it's called heaven and when you're in heaven you'll receive everything you've ever hoped to have you'll be an heir of Christ
[time=3318] everything he has you'll have the worthy one Dr. Donald Gray Barnhouse one of the great preachers of a previous generation and significant commentator on scripture says this about Revelation chapter 5
[time=3333] there are four things out of place in the universe the church is out of place she ought to be in heaven
[time=3341] Israel is out of place she should be in the land sworn to her and possess every last part of it
[time=3348] the devil is out of place he ought to be in the lake of fire but he is still roaming free
[time=3354] Christ is out of place he should be through with intercession and seated on his throne reigning instead of upon his father's throne interceding
[time=3364] that's interesting isn't it Christ yet is not reigning as he will he is not yet on his own throne reigning as his father has promised even to this moment he intercedes at the right hand of the throne of God for us
[time=3377] but with Revelation 5 everything begins to change the church is where it ought to be in heaven
[time=3383] Israel is about to possess every last square foot of the land as it's given back to her by her king Christ as he comes
[time=3390] the devil will be bound for a thousand years and then burned forever in the lake of fire never to be seen or heard of again
[time=3397] Christ will finally be in his pre- in it role as reigning king
[time=3404] and so the vision we see in chapter five begins all of that with the taking of the scroll
[time=3411] let's pray together this has been a refreshing day as we listen to the sanctuary choir and orchestra sing of the majesty of our heavenly father
