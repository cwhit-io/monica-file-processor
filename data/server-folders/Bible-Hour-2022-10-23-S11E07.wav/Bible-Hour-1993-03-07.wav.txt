[time=0] what does the Bible say about how I'm going to, or supposed to worship God, what does
[time=27] the Bible say about how I'm going to, or supposed to worship God today? The worship we've seen in Revelation 4 and 5 is a worship in another time and another place.
[time=36] And the question remains, but I live here on planet Earth. What does the Bible
[time=42] instruct me about how to worship God today?
[time=57] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope
[time=63] you'll find to be in encouragement. Thank you for joining us. It's as in Second Chronicles 16-9, "The eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth, that he may strongly support those whose heart is completely his." The Marines are looking for a few good men. God is looking for a few good hearts. Stay with us today as Pastor Moore develops
[time=84] this theme from God's Word. Our program will open with special music by the sanctuary choir and orchestra, and include specials by Kevin Rowe and Lisa Feeney. Let's now join our service.
[time=114] [MUSIC - 144 seconds]
[time=286] [APPLAUSE]
[time=292] [MUSIC - 271 seconds]
[time=582] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. I hope you missed us last week as we were pre-empted by the March of Dimes
[time=588] and we are happy to be on and ministering to you today. From time to time we have guest speakers that come and we have an outstanding speaker from California, Bob Vernon coming to speak on April 18th. Tell us a little bit about him.
[time=602] Thank you Pete. Bob Vernon has been the assistant police chief of the Los Angeles Police Department for I think some 10 or 12 years and has been in the service there for over 20. Bob is an outstanding Christian man who loves God and who has seen Christ do some incredible things in his life and in his ministry as a police officer in Los Angeles and of course Bob was at the helm when the most recent uprising occurred in Los Angeles has written a book called LA Justice.
[time=631] He's going to be with us on April 18th and I respect him deeply. He's been an elder of a strong evangelical church in Los Angeles for a number of years, a tremendous speaker and I think we're going to be encouraged as we hear him address some of the contemporary issues and how they relate in our relationship with Christ.
[time=647] I suppose it's been at least 12 years since I heard Bob Vernon speak but I was very impressed. I remember that he left an impression on me even that many years ago and so if you can get out and join us here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church on Sunday morning April 18th put that on your calendar.
[time=663] Come join with us in the worship services otherwise continue to watch in the Bible hour and we'll remind you from time to time that Bob Vernon will be speaking.
[time=672] Then we have another great event coming up. We're having the Jeremiah people at Blackhawk on Saturday evening March 27th at 6.30 p.m.
[time=680] This is a dinner theater. We'll have a very wonderful dinner and then this comedy called Stop the Presses and this is a ticketed event and if you'd like to receive more information on this evening March 27th with Jeremiah people just call the church office at 4937400 and they can tell you how you can purchase tickets.
[time=701] Boy this is a delightful evening where you can just relax with your friends and then enjoy a wonderful comedy entitled Stop the Presses. I hope you'll be with us.
[time=710] Again the date is March 27th at 6.30 p.m. right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=717] Russell we've been talking about the tapes for the last couple weeks called The Christian in the Face of the Enemy, a series of messages that you did just a few weeks ago.
[time=726] That's right. There's four messages and they're about Satan and demons and the question that's being asked is how can they impact my effort to live the Christian life?
[time=735] What can they do? What can't they do? What should my response be to them? I mean how am I supposed to live a successful Christian life in light of that?
[time=743] So it's an interesting series from God's Word.
[time=746] I hope that you'll write for this series its four messages on two tapes very nicely packaged and again it's titled The Christian in the Face of the Enemy and you can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=766] We'll go back now to the live portion of our service with more music and then the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=776] [MUSIC - 28 seconds]
[time=819] Sing to the Lord, He is worthy of praise. Raise up your voices in song. Sing to the Lord for the rest of your days. To Him your praises belong.
[time=839] Sing to the Lord, He's done marvelous things. Creation pronounces His name. Sing to the Lord, He's the Savior at being with all the earth. Raise His name.
[time=861] Sing to the Lord, Sing to the Lord, Sing to the Lord.
[time=877] The Lord has provided for our every need His mercy and love of the flow. The gift of salvation is God's gift indeed. We sing that the whole world may know, may know, sing.
[time=906] Sing to the Lord, He is worthy of praise. Raise up your voices in song. Sing to the Lord for the rest of your days. To Him your praises belong.
[time=927] Sing to the Lord, Sing to the Lord, Sing to the Lord.
[time=943] [APPLAUSE]
[time=951] Take your Bibles this morning, will you, and let's open them to the Old Testament. Second Chronicles. Hmm, where is that? Second Chronicles, 1st and 2 Samuel, 1st and 2 Kings, 1st and 2 Chronicles. Chapter 25.
[time=970] And you may have expected me, if you've been with us on a regular basis, to ask you to open to the Book of Revelation. We're not going to go there this morning. We're going to talk about something though that we've been thinking about through Revelation. And it's the theme of worship.
[time=987] I just don't feel as though it's time to move out of chapters 4 and 5 and that theme of worship as we've discovered it in the Book of Revelation. So I want to step back this morning and talk to you about what the Word of God says to us a little further about worship.
[time=1002] We've seen in Revelation that God is on His throne. We've seen Him there surrounded by 24 elders who on their thrones and overcome with the majesty of God, fall down, prostrate, throw their crowns, which they had earned all of their life through their good deeds at His feet, giving Him all that they are.
[time=1019] We've seen that He has also surrounded there by these four living creatures, these angelic beings with six wings and they sing holy, holy, holy. And we then came to chapter 5 of Revelation. We saw Christ, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, who when gazed upon by the Apostle John in reality looked as a lamb, a little Arneas, a little baby lamb who had been slain yet was standing, speaking of His death and His resurrection.
[time=1046] And it's there that it crescendos into this great pay on of praise where every created being in heaven and on earth and under the earth give glory and honor and praise and dominion and power to the name of Christ.
[time=1057] So we've looked at heavenly worship, we've looked into the future, excuse me, and we've seen what is coming. We've seen the marvelous glory of heavenly worship.
[time=1066] And though we've tried to learn from that and make some level of application from that, that is worship for another time and worship in another place.
[time=1076] And so today I want to go back to the Word of God and say, "What does the Word of God say to me today about how I ought to be worshiping Him?"
[time=1084] What does the Bible say about how I'm to worship God today? And really we'll organize our thoughts around two general principles and then come back with five specific examples of worshiping God in our day and age.
[time=1099] And we begin with principle number one out of this passage, 2 Chronicles chapter 25 verses 1 and 2.
[time=1108] Amaziah, King Amaziah was 25 years old when he became king and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Jehodun of Jerusalem.
[time=1122] And then verse 2, "And he did right in the sight of the Lord, yet not with a whole heart."
[time=1133] He did right in the sight of the Lord, yet not with a whole heart. That really could become a thesis statement around which we could write an entire paper or a book about what not to do in worship.
[time=1145] How not to worship?
[time=1148] 29 years of doing the right stuff, sticking to the rules, conforming to the external code of behavior, doing all that he was supposed to do and yet without a whole heart for God.
[time=1162] The heart is capable of atrophy. Attrophy is that thing, I guess, that happens when a physical organ or a muscle becomes dysfunction because of disuse.
[time=1175] That took on a whole new meaning in my life. When I was 16 years old, I found out that I had deformed feet and I had come off a really neat football season where I had been the quarterback of our high school football team.
[time=1186] And because we had a small high school, I could also play on the basketball team and had had a lot of fun playing basketball with the team, but found as the season progressed when I came home at night, great chunks of skin were coming off the bottoms of my feet.
[time=1199] And so I showed that to my mom and dad, and my dad took me to an orthopedic surgeon, and he said, "Well, you have what they call Cavis feet," which is an arch that is too pronounced, it's too high, which leaves too little of your actual foot to touch the ground.
[time=1211] And so when you move and stop and start in basketball, what little part of your foot does touch the ground wears out, and it peels off.
[time=1219] It was becoming very painful, so they performed a surgery on both my feet at the same time, they released the muscles in the bottom of my feet, and then put my feet in casts that pulled my foot backward and acted kind of like braces for your teeth to stretch it back to where it ought to be.
[time=1235] And when they were done with three months, my feet were not too highly arched, they were back to normal where they should have been, but there was another problem.
[time=1243] And as they took that thing and cut my cast off my legs, I looked at my calves, and I didn't even recognize them, they weren't my calves, they were just these white pale, skinny little sticks that came up off my ankles.
[time=1261] That was absolutely embarrassed, it was just emaciated little nothings.
[time=1266] In fact, they had to help me like get from the table over to the sink where you wash them, because I couldn't even hardly walk.
[time=1272] All the muscle, all the strength that I'd used to play football and basketball and just be a normal average ordinary kid, it was just gone.
[time=1280] And three months time, Atrophied.
[time=1285] Atrophied took place in the life for the heart of Amaziah, and by the time you come to verse 14, though he has successfully led a campaign according to the rules against the enemy of God, by the time you come to verse 14.
[time=1298] Now it came about after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites that he brought the gods of the sons of seer, set them up as his gods bowed down before them and burned incense to them.
[time=1310] His heart had atrophied, he was hollow on the inside, he was doing all kinds of externals, he was keeping all the rules, he was involved in all the ritual, but inside he was hollow, hollow to the core.
[time=1326] Had occasion to travel to New York City when they were fixing up the beautiful lady of the harbor, saw her there surrounded by some 300,000 feet of scaffolding, and upon the scaffolding scurried the men who were fixing and repairing and restoring and touching up.
[time=1343] Caused me to think, Gee, I wonder how many Christians lives are held together by the scaffolding of our external religion.
[time=1351] And the only reason we look decent is because on that external scaffolding run the little things, the books, the seminars, all the movies, all the things we try to do.
[time=1360] You ask yourself, why couldn't the lady fix herself? Why did she need the scaffolding and the externals? Why couldn't she just fix herself?
[time=1371] Well, she's hollow, she's hollow to the core.
[time=1379] Externals. The first principle about worship is this, God wants you to worship him with your whole heart.
[time=1391] God wants you to worship him with his whole heart. Come back a few chapters, let me introduce you to another king.
[time=1397] And this king's life gives a stage upon which God can express his real desire in men and in women.
[time=1404] Second Chronicles 16, verse 9.
[time=1411] Asa is the king of Judah. Speaking to him, the Lord says, "For the eyes of the Lord move to and fro."
[time=1421] This is 16, verse 9, "For the eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth, that he may strongly support those whose heart is completely his."
[time=1432] God wants your whole heart. God wants everything inside of what you are, the heart being that place where you meet God, the heart out of which come all the issues of life, where you make all your plans, where you set all your aspirations, where you purpose all your dreams.
[time=1447] God wants that holy and completely fixed upon him.
[time=1451] You'll notice they describe God here as having human features, the eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth that he may strongly support.
[time=1460] He's involved in a quick, decisive, purposeful search to find people with a heart that is completely his.
[time=1470] The Marines appealing to our sense of exclusivity say, "We're looking for a few good men."
[time=1477] God says, "I'm looking for a few good hearts."
[time=1483] To prove that, when it was time to find a new king for Israel, when Saul had failed so horribly, they looked in the household of Jesse and found their one, a lion who was really good to look at.
[time=1496] He could have been a media figure in our day. He had all the markings of a really handsome, distinguished, prominent individual.
[time=1504] But it says in 1 Samuel 16, "I have rejected him, for God sees not as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart."
[time=1517] And so, instead, David, who hadn't even been brought to the forum, because he was out in the field, tending his sheep, was brought, and we are later told that David was a man after God's own heart.
[time=1528] David had a heart for God, so much so that later in his life, Saul in 139, he wrote, "Search me, O God, and know my heart."
[time=1540] "Search me, O God, and know my heart, try me and know my anxious thoughts, and see if there be any hurtful way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."
[time=1555] We are so prone, in our day and age, to be known by our credentials, and when we are introduced, we say, "Well, this is a good friend of mine. His name is John, and he is an attorney with so-and-so, and he went to such and such a law school."
[time=1570] Or, "This is John, my good friend, the doctor, and he works at such and such a place, and he does such and such there."
[time=1577] We are a credentialed community, and we want to do the same thing with God. When God comes to meet us, we want to stop him right at the externals and say, "Wait a minute, God, don't look at my heart, listen to about what I'm doing for you. I've been in church six out of the last eight Sundays.
[time=1596] I've been studying my Bible at least three times a week. We've even started to give to the church. God, stop right here at my externals. Pretty good, huh? What do you think? How am I doing?"
[time=1612] God goes right past your externals and looks at your heart. Proverbs 4, 23, "Watch over your heart with all diligence for from it flow the springs or the issues of life."
[time=1629] I'm so intrigued by the fact that in the New Testament, there is nothing said to us by way of form of worship.
[time=1640] Do you like the order of service today as it was laid out? I did. I enjoyed it a lot. I'm thankful for it.
[time=1645] The way it all seems to fit together and they're the congregational hymns and the invocation and then the congregational chorus and then the saints require an orchestra and then on and on it goes.
[time=1655] You know where it came from? It didn't come from God. It didn't come from the Word of God.
[time=1663] It came from Peter Coby. He's our minister of music. He sits in his office and thinks, "How can I encourage and stimulate and lead the people in worship?"
[time=1674] Nowhere we told Howard to run our service. I think it punctuates the point that God is a whole lot less concerned with how we run our service than what's going on inside of our hearts while we're in the service.
[time=1684] And I know that's Peter's heart as well. We ought to have an orderly service. We ought to have a service that if an unsaid person comes in and says, "Hey, this is organized. This is pointing in the direction. The Bible is clear there."
[time=1698] We ought to have a service that includes the teaching of the Word of God, Ephesians 4. That's clear.
[time=1703] We ought to have a service in which we sing praises to God, Ephesians 5. That's clear.
[time=1708] But as to how we order and structure and put it together and what comes first in the next, God is silent.
[time=1713] Because God really cares about what we're doing in our hearts during those activities.
[time=1719] So principle number one about worship. General principle about worship. For the here and now, God wants your whole heart engaged in worship.
[time=1727] Principle number two, if you'd come to Isaiah with me for just a minute, Isaiah chapter one.
[time=1736] This is a marvelous passage, a tremendous insight into the topic of worship.
[time=1744] Isaiah chapter one, now unlike the New Testament church, when God founded the nation of Israel, he told them exactly how they were supposed to worship.
[time=1754] And every little detail, he dotted every eye and crossed every tee when he explained to them the very specific ways in minute detail that they were to bring offering before him when and what kind and what kind for which occasion and who would preside and what would happen next.
[time=1770] It was all laid out as completely and as formally as it could possibly be laid out.
[time=1774] And the people you're going to read about here were doing it with that kind of commitment to the minutiae.
[time=1779] They were following every last little detail in their worship.
[time=1782] Isaiah chapter one verses 11 and following, but listen to what God says.
[time=1787] "What are your multiplied sacrifices to me?" says the Lord.
[time=1791] "I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed cattle.
[time=1797] And I take no pleasure in the blood of bulls, lambs or goats.
[time=1801] When you come to appear before me, who requires of you this trampling of my courts?
[time=1806] Bring your worthless offering no longer. Incense is an abomination to me.
[time=1811] New moon and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies, I cannot endure iniquity and to solemn assembly."
[time=1819] Verse 14, "I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts.
[time=1823] They have become a burden to me. I am weary of bearing them.
[time=1828] So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide my eyes from you.
[time=1832] Yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen.
[time=1835] Your hands are covered with blood." You say, "What in the world?" Here are a bunch of people following the exact prescribed pattern of worship.
[time=1843] And God is saying, "I've had enough. Stop it. I hate them.
[time=1847] They're a burden to me and the whole essence of worship to commune with God." He says, "When you pray, I hide my eyes from you." We're not communing here. We're not worshiping here.
[time=1857] Nothing's going on between you and me as you follow those prescribed rules.
[time=1861] You say, "Why? Why is that?" Well, look at verse 4.
[time=1873] Alas, sinful nation, people weighed down with iniquity, offspring of evildoers,
[time=1880] sons who act corruptly. They have abandoned the Lord.
[time=1884] They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They have turned away from Him.
[time=1888] You say, "What do you mean? How did they do that?" Look at verses 16 and 17.
[time=1896] Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, remove the evil of your deeds from my sight,
[time=1902] cease to do evil, learn to do good, seek justice, reprove the ruthless, defend the orphan and plead for the widow.
[time=1913] The nation of Israel had made one of the fatal mistakes of worship.
[time=1917] They had thought that they could separate the worship event, the coming to the temple, the sacrificial offering of the lamb and the goat and the bowl and the calf.
[time=1928] They thought they could separate the formal act of worship from the rest of their life.
[time=1935] The rest of their life, they were characteristically evil.
[time=1938] They had forsaken justice. They were giving privilege to the wealthy and they were taking advantage of the ruthless and the orphan and the widow.
[time=1947] In other words, they had thought that they could separate make a dichotomous relationship between what I do in our case on Sunday morning and with what I do the rest of the week.
[time=1958] And God says, "Never make that mistake because when during the rest of the week you live a vile, sinful and godly, unworshipful life.
[time=1966] And then you come into the assembly and even if you follow my pattern and even if you follow my prescribed prescription of worship it is burdensome to me." I don't want any to do with it.
[time=1978] I'm tired of it.
[time=1981] So principle number two.
[time=1984] God wants you to worship Him with a whole heart because when you worship Him with a whole heart your worship extends to your whole life.
[time=1995] You've heard of lifelong learning? This is life-wide worship.
[time=2001] Life-wide worship. It permeates every dimension of life.
[time=2006] Every dimension of your existence. Not just what happens here on Sunday morning.
[time=2014] Not just what happens at the breakfast table when you have your quiet time.
[time=2019] Not just what happens at the end of the day when you pray with your children.
[time=2024] Life-wide worship. Your whole life.
[time=2028] God wants to be worshiped with your whole heart and by your whole life.
[time=2032] You say, "Okay, that's the Old Testament." Does the New Testament say that?
[time=2036] Yes. Would you turn to Romans chapter 12?
[time=2041] Romans chapter 12, just a tremendously familiar verse, but when seen in this light, fascinating.
[time=2053] Many of us have this verse memorized. Romans chapter 12 verse 1.
[time=2058] He says, "I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and a holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship."
[time=2070] Question. Where? Where are the cattle?
[time=2076] Where's the calf?
[time=2080] Is there someplace else in the New Testament that tells us what kind of bull we're supposed to bring?
[time=2085] Or the lamb? Where do we go to learn about what we bring to the place of sacrifice?
[time=2091] Which animal is it that we're supposed to bring now that we're in the New Testament?
[time=2097] Well, I'll read it again. The animal is found right in the verse.
[time=2100] I urge who? You. Therefore, by the mercies of God, to present not a bull, not a calf, not a lamb, not a ram,
[time=2111] present your own body a living and a holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship.
[time=2125] The sacrificial animal of the New Testament worship is you.
[time=2131] You say, "Wait a minute. I thought Christ was a sacrificial lamb. You're right." He is the only one that can deal with our sins. He is the only one that can appease the wrath.
[time=2139] He is the only one who can make atonement for our sins, but he having done that in response to his great sacrifice,
[time=2147] in his response to his great propitiation, the appeasing of the anger of God for our sins.
[time=2152] There is in this phrase at the beginning of verse 1, "I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God."
[time=2158] The therefore explains, because he has done this, and Romans is this great discourse of the gospel of God,
[time=2165] how we are born into our sin and how only Christ could forgive us our sins, and how he, like the second Adam, died for us that he might make us righteous.
[time=2174] Because he has done that, by the mercies of God through the person of Christ,
[time=2180] the obvious response then is to present yourself, your body, who you are, your mind, your soul, your spirit, all that you are,
[time=2190] as the sacrifice. You want to worship God. You want to learn how to worship God today in the here and now.
[time=2202] It is a complete and total sacrifice of who you are to God.
[time=2210] That is what is described in the New Testament as acceptable and reasonable.
[time=2216] I grew up on the King James Version. My new American Standard reads, "At the end of that verse, which is your spiritual service of worship," the King James read, "which is your reasonable, your reasonable service."
[time=2231] In other words, in light of all these done, this really isn't out of line, is it?
[time=2235] This really isn't asking too much. One of the great missionaries of the previous centuries, C.T. Stud.
[time=2243] He grew up in the 1870s, and he really had a life of blessing. He had a life of great pleasure.
[time=2249] His father had made a great fortune in India as a businessman.
[time=2253] And C.T. Stud was in line to obviously move into all of that wealth and all the prestige that he gave him in England.
[time=2260] And he was also blessed with athletic ability. He was a very, very talented young man and was in his day revered as one of the greatest cricket players to have lived and to have played the sport.
[time=2272] Just an absolute shining star on the horizon with everything that he could ever hope for at his grasp.
[time=2280] Interesting, though, his father came to know Christ in a DL Moody revival meeting.
[time=2288] Moody got to him. Christ got to him through Moody.
[time=2292] And so he came back to his homeland and said, "Boy, I've got to bring my son to Christ." And so he labored to present the gospel to C.T. Stud, who eventually prayed to receive Christ as his Lord and Savior.
[time=2302] And when he came to grips with the reality of this passage, "I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and a holy sacrifice acceptable to God."
[time=2312] Which is your reasonable act of worship. He wrote this, I quote, "If Jesus Christ be God and died for me, then no sacrifice that I will ever make for him could ever be too great."
[time=2328] If Jesus Christ be God and died for me, then no sacrifice that I will ever make could ever be too great.
[time=2340] C.T. Stud, because God called him, left his home, left his fortune, and went to China with six other young men heading for that mission field.
[time=2353] God used them greatly in China. He later went to India. Finally, he went to Africa and eventually died, having spent his entire life and his life strength,
[time=2362] proposing the gospel to people who had never heard it.
[time=2367] If Jesus Christ be God and died for me, then no sacrifice that I will ever make for him could ever be too great.
[time=2377] It says in 1 Corinthians 6, "Do you not know that your body is not your own? You have been bought with a price."
[time=2386] We are not our own anymore. The reason we sacrifice our lives, the reason we sacrifice our bodies is simply a matter of ownership.
[time=2393] We are not owned by him anymore. Excuse me by ourselves, we are owned by him.
[time=2398] One of the most unattractive elements in Christianity today, and I find it most unattractive when I see it in myself,
[time=2406] is the notion that when I sacrifice for God, when I serve God, when I do something for God, that I am indeed making some great sacrifice.
[time=2419] Maybe we get that as little kids when we were in Sunday school and the teacher was telling us about the little boy with the five loaves and the two fish.
[time=2427] And oftentimes the application at the end of that little story is in boys and girls. This little boy sacrificed his lunch.
[time=2436] What he was hungry for. Wouldn't you want to be like that little boy? Wouldn't you want to be the one who offered up his own lunch and became the hero of the story?
[time=2448] If thousands have read about through the centuries that have passed since, oh little boys and girls, be brave to sacrifice for God as if that were some great and awesome thing.
[time=2462] I believe the miracle of the story about the little boy and his lunch isn't that a little boy was willing to give up his lunch.
[time=2470] The miracle is that Christ, the same Christ who can create things out of nothing, was willing to use the little boy's lunch and in that way cut him in on a piece of the action.
[time=2489] There is no miracle. There is no marvelous, great and awesome thing about you and I coming to the recognition that we need to crawl up every single morning and lay our entire body's lives, heart, mind and soul upon the altar of God and say let me be a living sacrifice.
[time=2505] There is no miracle there. The miracle is that if we do that, God just may use us.
[time=2520] So we learned this morning about worship, two basic principles. God wants you to worship him with your whole heart.
[time=2527] And secondly that when we worship God with our whole heart, it means we will worship God with our whole life.
[time=2534] Everything that we are and have, we will humbly offer at his disposal and hopes that he may use it for something beyond ourselves.
[time=2547] Then I want to take a look this morning now at these five specific examples of worship and just briefly say to you, it's a little general.
[time=2557] Could you be more specific? Does the Bible get more definitive? How am I supposed to worship God with my whole life?
[time=2562] What does that mean? Does that mean I walk around all day long and I'm quoting Bible verses every second of every day?
[time=2569] Does it mean that I sit in some quiet room and ponder the things of God my whole life? Would that require me to become some type of a monk?
[time=2576] What does it mean, Russell, to worship God with your whole life? Does the Bible give us any specifics? Yes it does.
[time=2585] At least five that we'll look at this morning. Let's begin in Luke and we'll go to some passages here as we pursue this line of reasoning.
[time=2593] Luke chapter 17 starts at a very basic place in our life. The theme here is giving glory to God. To give glory to God.
[time=2603] Well you say God, what does he need glory from me for? He's got his own glory. Well you're right, there is the intrinsic glory of God, nothing could be added to that.
[time=2610] But there is then the ascribed glory of God where you and I ascribe him the glory that has do his name and that is the worship of the New Testament, to give God glory.
[time=2620] Are you there? Luke chapter 17 verse 11. And it came about while he was on the way to Jerusalem that he was passing between Samaria and Galilee, speaking of course of Jesus.
[time=2632] And as he entered a certain village, ten leperous men who stood at a distance met him.
[time=2637] And they raised their voices saying, "Jesus, master, have mercy on us." And when he saw them, he said to them, "Go and show yourself to the priests."
[time=2647] And it came about that as they were going, they were cleansed.
[time=2651] Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice.
[time=2659] And he fell in his face at his feet, giving thanks to him. And he was a Samaritan.
[time=2666] Verse 17, Jesus answered and said, "Were there not ten cleansed but the nine? Where are they?"
[time=2674] Was no one found who turned back to give glory to God except this foreigner?
[time=2679] And he said to him, "Rise and go your way, your faith has made you well." Now what we bring attention to here is that a man is giving glory to God.
[time=2688] Here's a specific example of a way in the ongoing of life that we give glory to God.
[time=2693] And the emphasis here is not a posture. It's not that he happened to have fallen down and become prostrate.
[time=2698] It's that in his heart, remember God wants your heart, not your externals.
[time=2703] He was giving thanks to God. Verse 16, he fell in his face at his feet and gave thanks to him.
[time=2710] Say, "Man, you're getting all excited about this little thought. Like give thanks. What's the big deal?"
[time=2720] Well, that's a way we can glorify God. And I am, as I look at my own life, remarkably ungrateful.
[time=2726] I find that what I want is the next blessing.
[time=2729] I'm like the people in the New Testament who came to Christ and said, "Show us another sign that we want.
[time=2734] What's next? What else you got for me here?" And we so quickly assimilate what he has given us and even forgetting to stop and say thanks from our hearts.
[time=2745] That speaks of really being content, doesn't it?
[time=2748] That speaks of really being satisfied, of taking a deep spiritual breath and just going,
[time=2754] "Oh my goodness, God, I'm thankful." That brings glory to God.
[time=2761] Glorify God, worship God in your life on a regular basis by cultivating an attitude of contentment and thankfulness for what God has done.
[time=2768] Principle number two or example number two. And for this we'll go to John, John chapter 14.
[time=2775] John chapter 14 verse 13, we can start reading in verse 12.
[time=2795] "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in me, the works that I do, shall he do also.
[time=2802] And greater works than these he shall do, because I go to the Father." Now verse 13, "And whatever you ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son."
[time=2818] What Jesus is telling us isn't that we can ask for anything we want and he'll give it to us.
[time=2823] He's saying, "If you'll ask things according to my name, and that means according to who I am and my character and what I stand for and the truth I taught and the mission that I've come to do.
[time=2832] If you'll be asking me to do things that are consistent with my name, God will grant the request and God will be glorified in all of that."
[time=2841] I'm so excited about a new little prayer sheet that's starting to circulate around Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2845] It comes out of the ED ministry of Angelism discipleship.
[time=2849] Every Wednesday our staff receives a copy of it and then it goes on up into the ED group and they pray over it and if you'd like a copy of it, I could get you one.
[time=2859] But so exciting, what we have there is a list of people that we're going to go visit.
[time=2863] And of course their names aren't there, just initials because that's confidential.
[time=2867] But we have an opportunity to pray according to the name of Christ with respect to people coming to Christ, that those visits will be used of God to meet a need in the lives and the hearts of those we're going to visit.
[time=2878] And then under that section, there's another little section called "To the Praise and the Glory of the Father." That's the title on this pursue, "To the Praise and the Glory of the Father." And you know what's listed under there? The names of the people who have come to Christ through that ministry.
[time=2895] And so we just sit in there, we just pray to the praise and the glory of God the Father for those who have come to Christ.
[time=2901] You see, when we pray, and we pray consistently with the name of Christ, then God begins to answer those prayers.
[time=2908] And when God answers those prayers, it brings glory to His name.
[time=2912] You say, Russell, tell me how I can bring glory to God's name.
[time=2915] How does worship invade my life beyond what I'm sitting here?
[time=2920] Well, do you have a prayer life?
[time=2925] Do you have a prayer diary?
[time=2942] Do you pray beyond the glandular, beyond when you feel like it?
[time=2956] Specific application number three, or example number three, come with me over to 1 Peter.
[time=2967] 1 Peter chapter 4, I never saw this before, this week, never understood this so clearly.
[time=2978] 1 Peter chapter 4 verses 14 and following, you know, Peter's all about suffering, right?
[time=2982] Peter's the book all about suffering.
[time=2985] If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
[time=2995] Verse 15, "By no means let any of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evil doer or a troublesome medeller."
[time=3002] In other words, don't be suffering for Christ because you're a jerk or because you're sinful or because you're difficult.
[time=3010] Verse 16, "But if anyone suffers as a Christian because you're godly and you love Christ and you're committed to helping people and you stand for truth,
[time=3017] if anybody suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed, but in that name let him glorify God.
[time=3026] We glorify God. We have as an act of our worship, our suffering for Christ consistent with his nature and character.
[time=3039] Man, I know a lot of people that are working really, really hard not to suffer in their Christian life.
[time=3045] I know a lot of people who want to take any path and any road and any solution other than the one that would lead them to suffering for Christ.
[time=3054] And in our culture, not being beaten up and thrown in prison, just suffering, just taking the hard course of obedience.
[time=3060] But we struggle with that, don't we?
[time=3062] We just want to find an easier way. We don't want to suffer.
[time=3068] And then the words of this Puritan ring in our ears, "The things of this world will no more keep out trouble of spirit than a piece of paper will stop a bullet."
[time=3080] That's a vivid picture. A piece of paper doesn't do anything to a bullet.
[time=3087] You understand, we will never deal with the earnest wrestling of our souls by trying to cram our lives full of anything other than God Himself.
[time=3101] Christ is always calling us to live for things beyond the here and now.
[time=3106] Christ is always calling us to the high road.
[time=3109] Christ is always calling us in wisdom to what is do, to do what is best for Him and for us.
[time=3115] If trouble is in your way, march through it with a commitment to obedience and recognize you glorify God in so doing.
[time=3124] Principle number four, Romans 15.
[time=3130] Or a specific example, number four, Romans chapter 15.
[time=3143] Verse 15, Paul of course is writing, "But I have written very boldly to you on some points, so as to remind you again because of the grace that was given me from God."
[time=3157] Now verse 16, "To be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that my offering of the Gentiles might become acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
[time=3173] Look at how he views his life.
[time=3175] He views his ministry to propagate the gospel in verse 16, he says, "I am a priest of the gospel.
[time=3181] I am involved in the sacrifice, the offering up of worship, the offering up of acceptable worship when I am acting as the priest of the gospel of God."
[time=3191] How does that happen?
[time=3192] Well, I win these Gentiles to Christ and then they become my offering.
[time=3196] They become my sacrificial lamb.
[time=3199] They become what I bring to God, not just in myself, but I bring them as well.
[time=3204] We worship God with our life when all of our life revolves and centers around bringing people to Christ.
[time=3212] When we are a living witness of Christ, when we are involved in the evangelistic endeavor, when we are seeing people come to Christ, we view ourselves as a priest of the gospel who is seeking to bring people to Christ who can then be offered up as acceptable into God.
[time=3227] I believe God wants us to be praying so that the name of Christ, things consistent with the cause of Christ can be accomplished so that he can be glorified.
[time=3235] And part of that glory are these actual people who come to Christ and are then offered up as part of the acceptable sacrifice.
[time=3243] Come with me now for the last principle this morning and that would be that we would bear fruit.
[time=3249] Colossians chapter 1 verse 10, Colossians chapter 1 verse 10.
[time=3257] There's a passage in the Gospel of John we won't turn to this morning that says that when we bear fruit we glorify God.
[time=3266] When we bear fruit we glorify God.
[time=3268] The question is what does it mean to bear fruit?
[time=3271] And sometimes people think you're only bearing fruit when you're leading another person to Christ.
[time=3274] That's the only fruit there is, but that's not what the Bible says.
[time=3278] Galatians 5 talks about the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, etc.
[time=3284] That's bearing fruit when you have the character and the attitude of Christ and that's coming through in your life you're bearing fruit.
[time=3292] And then here in this passage Colossians 1 verse 10.
[time=3296] He says so that you may walk in a manner worthy of the Lord to please him in all respects bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
[time=3307] Here the notion of bearing fruit extends, it's almost as if we end where we began to every dimension of our life.
[time=3314] We bear fruit and therefore we worship God in every good work.
[time=3322] Worship then is not something that we do in this building alone.
[time=3326] Worship is not some spiritual goose bump that we have when we have an especially insightful truth from our quiet time.
[time=3334] Worship is something that invades all of our life because it is something we have given our whole heart to.
[time=3342] We worship God when we praise Him and have a thankful heart.
[time=3345] We worship God when we pray according to the will of Christ for this world.
[time=3350] We worship God in our willingness to suffer for His name's sake.
[time=3354] We worship God when we witness for Christ.
[time=3357] We worship God when we bear fruit which is as broadly defined as all the good works in our life.
[time=3364] You say that's hard to do.
[time=3367] That's hard to do.
[time=3369] We live in a world that doesn't think much about worshiping God.
[time=3372] Worshiping God with your whole life is a matter of purposeing in your heart that the true grid, the true thing through which you'll pass all the decisions will not be how to stay in control of my life.
[time=3383] Or how to stay happy or how to get the most pleasure or how to avoid conflict.
[time=3388] Or whatever the grid is that each one of us has in our hearts.
[time=3393] It's the purpose in your heart, the true and only grid will be.
[time=3398] How can I bring glory to God?
[time=3400] Faced in this situation which decision brings the most glory to God?
[time=3407] Dare to be a Daniel.
[time=3409] Dare to stand alone.
[time=3412] Dare to have a purpose firm.
[time=3415] And dare to make it known.
[time=3418] Singing to the Lord has been the theme of our music today presented by our sanctuary choir and orchestra,
[time=3434] soloist Lisa Feeney and soloist Kevin Rowe.
[time=3443] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, it's normal for us to pray a prayer right now and ask Christ to come into your heart.
[time=3452] Let's pray that prayer today.
[time=3455] Dear Heavenly Father, I bow before you and I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross from my sins.
[time=3463] And today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3466] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3472] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3475] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3480] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3489] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or a cassette copy of the series on Satan, Demons and Spiritual Warfare entitled "The Christian in the Face of the Enemy",
