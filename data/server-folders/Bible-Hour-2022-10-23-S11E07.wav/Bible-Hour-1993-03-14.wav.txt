[time=17] Genesis 6 says, God says there, my spirit shall not always strive with man.
[time=23] And so Revelation 6 brings us to what is the Old Testament calls the day of Jacob's trouble.
[time=30] What the Lord calls birth pains, the day of vengeance in the book of Luke and the day of the Lord in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.
[time=39] [MUSIC]
[time=49] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=56] Thank you for joining us.
[time=58] The Bible is full of warning against the judgment of God.
[time=62] Though the message of vengeance, retribution and judgment is not a popular one, it must be told.
[time=68] Today we begin a study from the book of Revelation that deals in the coming judgment of God.
[time=73] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation chapter 6.
[time=79] We will be looking at verses 1 through 8.
[time=82] Our special music today will be provided by reflection.
[time=86] [MUSIC]
[time=89] Let's now join our service.
[time=116] [MUSIC - 220 seconds]

[time=702] Amen. Don't you love on a group like that, just nails a song. Wonderful song and well done.
[time=718] Thank you so much. What a blessing.
[time=722] Well let me invite you this morning if you have your bible with you to take it and open to Revelation chapter 6 and study with me or begin studying with me a wonderful section of scripture that
[time=736] really opens to us truth about the end of the age and it happens to be truth about the judgment
[time=744] of God. The wrath of God coming to earth. And this section goes from chapter 6 all the
[time=752] way to 16. It's a part of the things that are yet to occur. The future prophecy about the
[time=758] end of the age and it describes a cataclysmic holocaust worldwide that has never been seen
[time=767] before by this earth and frankly which this earth will not survive. This is the beginning
[time=773] of the end. It's called the tribulation period. It's seven years long and it ends the day of
[time=779] grace. It is the ending of the day of grace and it is the beginning of a whole new day,
[time=786] a day of judgment. The day of grace is the one in which we live. Second Peter 3 says that
[time=792] God is patient, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.
[time=799] God has seen now for the last two thousand years since the time of Christ as having been patient with the world. And we don't know how many more years, 10, 15, 20, 100, 2000 more
[time=810] years, 10,000 more years. We don't know how long this period of patience will go on.
[time=816] We don't know how long the tolerance of God or Romans 2 says the kindness, the forbearance and the patience of God will continue. But I can assure you that that period of time, the grace of God, the patience of God will someday come to an end. And when it does this
[time=833] is what will happen. This is the tribulation. This is the end of that period of patience, kindness, forbearance and grace. God said in Genesis 6, "My spirit shall not strive with
[time=845] man forever." And it might be best illustrated for us in the account of the flood. You remember
[time=854] Noah preached for about 120 years. There was a period of time where there was no judgment.
[time=861] It was coming, but during that 120 years, no judgment, just warning, just caution, just
[time=868] the prophetic word of Noah saying, "You need to repent. You need to get right with God.
[time=873] You need to turn from your wickedness for judgment is coming." But eventually, that 120 years though the people in his lifetime didn't know that the timing of it, they didn't know it was going to be 120 years, but eventually it stopped. And you'll remember the Lord himself closed the door of the ark. And once the door of the ark was closed, there was no room for
[time=895] repentance. There was no room to turn. There was no way to get on the ark. It was just rain
[time=903] and more rain. In fact, 2 Peter 3 says that the heavens and the earth are being reserved
[time=910] by the power of the Word of the Lord for a day of judgment. The reason we are not already
[time=916] gone is because we are being in reserve. We are being held for this great day of judgment.
[time=923] And so that's what's described. Chapters 6 and following it really is 14 chapters of
[time=930] the judgment of God. And though there will be some really exciting bright spots in here, we'll get to look at the 144,000 Jews that are redeemed and are preaching and proclaiming the gospel. We'll get to meet the two great witnesses who are probably other than Christ,
[time=945] my heroes in the New Testament. We'll get to meet the angel that flies through the air, heralding the gospel to all the world. We'll see that people come to Christ in the tribulation period, that they are rewarded marvelously for their faith. Though there will be bright spots, this is basically 14 chapters of judgment and wrath. And it kind of strikes a note of fear in my own heart. If we could cover a chapter a week, we'd be here for 14 weeks
[time=971] on this theme of the judgment and the wrath of God. That takes us to June, folks. It'll
[time=977] be summer by the time we're done talking about the wrath of God. And there is a hesitancy
[time=983] in my own heart. And though I don't want to be pedantic in all of this, I don't want to be consumed with details. I have no intention of throwing up detailed exquisite charts and
[time=992] timelines up on the screen. I don't want to immerse us into extravagant explanations
[time=998] of imagery that we'll find inside. I want to stay with the big major themes of this book.
[time=1005] I also don't want this time to be in the heart of the preacher, an angry, vindictive, vengeful,
[time=1011] kind of pulpit pounding fire and brimstone series of messages where we all feel scorched
[time=1017] at the end of every hour. But still, to stay on the theme as we will need to for a number
[time=1023] of weeks, in my mind, demanded some justification. And so I have six reasons this morning why I think it's worth our time as a church to spend extended periods of time thinking about
[time=1034] a theme such as judgment. In a day when most preachers are seeking to be as positive and as affirming and as comforting as possible, let me give you six reasons. First, Paul says
[time=1046] over in the book of Acts that he to the saints at Ephesus did not shrink from preaching the whole council of God. There is a responsibility to do that and this is a part of the whole council of God. There is in the Old Testament and the New Testament an enormous amount of the word of God which is devoted to warning a coming judgment. And so to be faithful to that charge, we will work our way through these chapters. Secondly, we must learn from the Old Testament prophets, men of God, who were faithful in their commissioning and calling before God to speak to the people, the message that God had given them. And oftentimes, more often than not, it was a message of judgment and a message of warning. And like Jeremiah, though, doing it with tears, the weeping prophet, but faithful still to preach, all that God would have given them to preach. Thirdly, we find in the life of Christ, great support
[time=1096] to spend time talking about the judgment of God. It may interest you to know that Jesus
[time=1102] Christ spent more time warning people about hell than he did telling them about heaven.
[time=1113] If you were to take a red pin, as I have done, and read through the book of Matthew and underline every verse where Jesus talks about hell, the gnashing of teeth, the eternal punishment,
[time=1126] the destruction, the departs from me, I never knew you, all of those references to hell,
[time=1132] you would find sixteen of them in total. The Lord, because of his compassion and his heart and his love for people, didn't shrink from the responsibility to warn them of a coming day of wrath and judgment. Fourthly, the Holy Spirit, by the words of our own Lord, in John
[time=1149] 16, 8, has come. It says, "When he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and
[time=1155] righteousness and judgment, sin and righteousness and judgment." And so, it is consistent with
[time=1163] the ministry of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, in this time, to the New Testament Church to give attention and to focus on the theme of judgment.
[time=1173] Fifth would be the words of Paul when in 2 Corinthians 5, 11 he said this, "Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men." There is reason to look at the hard parts of Scripture, the
[time=1185] judgment parts of Scripture, because in looking at them, we are reminded and we see very clearly
[time=1191] the wrath of God to come and therefore the terror of the Lord that is coming. And that served in Paul's life as a great motivator to win people to Christ, not just that he loved
[time=1202] those people and not just that he loved Christ and that love would compel him, 2 Corinthians 5, but also this terror of the Lord, knowing that it's coming, looking past the thin veneer
[time=1213] of people's lives and the circumstances which say all is well and knowing the wrath to come
[time=1219] and looking at them for what really is their lot in life without Christ, to suffer the consequences
[time=1225] possibly of the tribulation and then certainly of hell.
[time=1230] It's a wonderful account of Paul in Acts, chapter 24. He is before a man by the name of Felix, and Felix was the governor of Judea and an ungodly man. He had stolen another man's wife. Her name was Drasilla and he had taken her from another man. He was immoral and ungodly and expedient and a pragmatist and without virtue and without character.
[time=1250] And Paul knew it. And Paul was in his court on trial for his life. His life hung in the
[time=1256] balance. Do you know what he was discussing with Felix? It says there he was discussing righteousness, self-control, and judgment. What a message for a guy that lived the life
[time=1270] of Felix. Let me talk to you about righteousness. And let me talk to you about self-control,
[time=1277] your ability to control your life and conform to the standard of righteousness. And now Felix, let me talk to you about what happens when you don't. Judgment awaits. And there
[time=1288] is one other and we might turn there. Keep your finger here in Revelation and come with me to 1 Thessalonians, chapter 5, just for a brief moment. This is a passage that also
[time=1299] describes the coming of the Lord, the day of the Lord. Paul is giving it, and he explains some of the reason why the preacher should teach, not just for the unbeliever, but also
[time=1310] for the believer. 1 Thessalonians, chapter 5, it begins in verse 1, of course, he's talking
[time=1316] about the times and the epics. Verse 3, they'll be saying peace and safety, but destruction will come upon them. But verse 8, he says, "But since we are of the day, let us be sober,
[time=1329] having put on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation." Verse 9, "For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ." In other words, we're not going to go through the tribulation, we who know Christ, he hasn't destined us for this great judgment. Verse 10, "Who died for us that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him." Then verse 11, "Therefore encourage one another and build up one another just as you also are doing."
[time=1358] For the believer, back to Revelation 6, "For the believer, those of us who know Christ, the study of this enormous time of wrath and judgment and vengeance and retribution stands
[time=1369] as an encouragement to us, and we can encourage each other that we don't go through that.
[time=1374] That God has not destined us for the day of wrath, the day of the Lord." So maybe if
[time=1380] you've jotted these down about May, you could take it back out and reflect, "Oh, that's why we're still talking about the judgment of God." These are the reasons. I remember now. And if those aren't enough, maybe the book of Revelation itself would be enough.
[time=1394] It is the only book in the Old and the New Testament that begins with a promise of blessing and ends with a promise of blessing. It is the book of Revelation alone that says in
[time=1403] chapter 1 verse 3, "Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, the one who reads, that's the preacher, the one who hears, that's the folks in the congregation, and all of us together would heed the things which are written in it for the time is near."
[time=1420] God Christ Himself has promised both at the beginning and the end of the book great blessing for those who would not only read it but hear it and heed it. And so I am encouraged in
[time=1430] my own heart to embark on a series of study that will take some time all about what is
[time=1438] typically the negative, the discouraging, the overwhelming sense of God's judgment in wrath. And I would invite you to join me in this, not just by your physical presence, but by joining me in your heart and in your mind to learn and explore the things that God would teach you and show you as you expose yourself to this teaching on the wrath of God,
[time=1459] the judgment of God.
[time=1465] With Revelation 6, we begin the discussion of a seven-year period. And I want to give a bit of an overview to it. It is the tribulation. It is the time in which Christ will not only
[time=1476] judge the ungodly, but He will take back the earth. And you remember what brought us to Revelation 6. It was in chapter 4 that we saw God enthroned on His great and majestic throne from which peels of thunder and flashes of lightning were exploding and it was on a crystal sea and the angels were worshiping and the redeemed church already raptured was there worshiping Him. And to give us a sense of what was happening, God is described in human terms as if He had a hand and He stretches out His hand and in His hand sits a little scroll with seven seals. And we said that is the title D to the earth. That is God's rightful
[time=1512] title D to the earth and Christ is the one. Though John wondering who would take it, the question is heralded, who would be worthy to take the scroll and no one is found in heaven on earth, under the earth, in the earth, nowhere is there one worthy. And so He begins to weep uncontrollably for fear that no one will be sufficient to take the earth back from Satan, take it back from death and from sin, and redeem the thing completely and totally and so He weeps. And then He's told to look behind Him, the lion of the tribe of Judah the root
[time=1543] of David, the lamb of God, the Arneas, the little lamb who was slain but standing crucified
[time=1549] but resurrected. It's the glorious resurrected living Jesus Christ. And all heaven breaks
[time=1555] out into this great payon of praise and not only heaven but all the creatures in earth and on the earth and under the earth because it was He who took out of the right hand of God the scroll. And it is the scroll with its seven seals that now we begin to understand
[time=1571] as in chapter six and following Christ breaks the first seal and we read what is there.
[time=1578] And then He'll break the next and the next and the next until all seven seals are broken.
[time=1588] The first three and a half years typically the tribulation is divided into two parts
[time=1594] because that's how our Lord looked at it. In Matthew 24 He talked about the beginning of birth pangs and that was the first three and a half years of this judgment. And it's for us seals one through five which we'll look at here. But this time is descriptive
[time=1609] of natural disaster. The second three and a half years it is supernatural disaster. There's
[time=1617] a great shift. And what happens in the middle is what they call the abomination of desolation.
[time=1622] That's the antichrist. That's a human person who has empowered by Satan himself. And he
[time=1629] becomes a world leader and midway through this seven year period he goes to the temple in Jerusalem and he desecrates the temple. He sets himself up as God and says I am the one to be worshiped. And that is the midpoint in the tribulation. What happens prior to that is natural destruction. What happens after that is supernatural destruction. But the Lord uses a wonderful term for the first three and a half years and it's birth pangs. The
[time=1653] term that the Lord gives for the second three and a half is called the great tribulation.
[time=1659] The birth pangs begin it and really the birth pangs run underneath all the way through and it's a wonderful analogy as only our Lord could teach and communicate. Think about birth pangs with me for a moment those of you who have had children and for those of us who have watched you have children. Never forget that with my wife. Watching those birth pangs
[time=1677] kind of begin quietly and subtly and there is not excruciating pain. It's unavoidable.
[time=1683] It's definitely there and then there's a long pause and then another one comes. But as
[time=1690] time goes by the pain becomes far more intense and the duration between the pain shortens
[time=1696] itself up and that is exactly the picture of the tribulation. There will be beginning pains and they will be somewhat painful and they will be separated in time but eventually
[time=1707] they'll begin to hit in rapid fire and rapid succession and the pain will intensify and escalate till it is absolutely unbearable. And what comes at the end of birth pangs the great event a birth in human terms a baby but in terms of the tribulation and the picture
[time=1722] that Christ is picturing the great event is not the birth of a baby it's the coming of Christ himself and he will come at the end of that period. And so he is the great one that is
[time=1732] expected he is the great event. So it is a seven year delivery process. It is a seven
[time=1739] year time of birth pangs and it anticipates and culminates not in the birth of a baby but
[time=1745] the birth of a king. The first three and a half years called the beginning birth pangs
[time=1751] by our Lord in Matthew 24 8 then the abomination of desolation and then this great tribulation as he called it in Matthew 24 21 which when we're finished with that the event of Christ
[time=1762] himself. The first three and a half years are described for you here in Revelation 6.
[time=1774] In chapter 6 verse 2 there are four horsemen described the first is on a white horse and
[time=1782] we'll talk about him in detail in a minute. The second is a red horse in verse 4 and he brings war a great time of war. The third horse is pictured for us in verses 5 and 6 he is
[time=1797] a black horse and he brings famine and the fourth horse is in verses 7 and 8 and he is
[time=1806] an ashen horse and he brings pestilence. So as I said those are the first birth pangs
[time=1814] those are the first three and a half years and all of those are just natural causes.
[time=1819] What eventually comes though in the second half is this great devastation that intensifies and dramatically changes the character of the earth. The third of the earth burns up in the second three and a half years. A third of the ocean and all of the creatures in the ocean and all of the ships on the ocean are destroyed in the second three and a half years.
[time=1841] A third of the sun and the moon are darkened, supernatural phenomena. Satan in the second
[time=1848] three and a half years is given a key and he takes the key down to the what they call the pit described in Jude where there are demons locked up there who have not been accessible
[time=1860] to the human race since prior to the flood. A whole host of demons are there and Satan
[time=1867] finally gets the key and he unlocks the key and flooding out of this pit comes a demonic host that are best described as scorpions and they have the power to sting and hurt and reflect though they cannot kill. And also in the second three and a half years Satan rallies
[time=1884] an army of some two hundred million and we don't know the Bible isn't sufficiently clear
[time=1891] whether or not it is an army of actual just humans or if it's demons or if it's demon
[time=1897] possessed humans but it is this vast army that assembles not at the not at the Armageddon battle this is prior to that and they will kill a third of the earth's population. So
[time=1909] it is a second three and a half years of supernatural destruction and as we have been taught it
[time=1917] is a period of chaos of natural disaster of escalating war and crime all the earth
[time=1923] is on this fast slide to destruction but it doesn't start that way. It doesn't start
[time=1931] that way at all. There is first a calm before the storm and we can see that in the first
[time=1938] two verses of Revelation 6 follow along as I read. And I saw when the lamb broke one
[time=1945] of the seven seals and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder come and I looked and behold a white horse and he who sat on it had a bow
[time=1959] and a crown was given to him and he went out conquering and to conquer. What's going
[time=1966] on here? Well let's just spend a minute trying to understand some of the descriptive phrasing here. First of all it's a white horse and that of course is the horse of a great conqueror it's the horse of a victory it's the horse that kings and great generals would ride in their victory parade as they would come back with all the spoils of war
[time=1984] and the men they had taken prisoner and possibly the other king himself and they would parade through the great city they would return to and he would be riding upon his noble steed and it would be white and he would be the victor. So this horse's color indicates victory it indicates great accomplishment. As does the crown that you'll notice has been given
[time=2004] to him there are two crowns described in the New Testament two different Greek words to describe the crowns. One is a diadem in the Greek the word is diadem and it is a crown
[time=2015] by virtue of your lineage you have royal blood and when your father dies you become the king and you get the crown the diadem. The other crown is a stefanos and that is
[time=2028] not a crown you get by virtue of having the right lineage it is one you must win it is one you must conquer to receive it was used in the games the olympic games of old and
[time=2039] when the athlete would would compete and would win they would crown him with a stefanos a wreath to acknowledge his victory and that is the crown here it is a stefanos that this
[time=2050] the writer of this white horse wears it is not given to him by his lineage it is given to him because he is a great conqueror and he is conquered but interestingly notice in
[time=2061] verse two I looked and behold a white horse and he sat on it had a bow but what is missing
[time=2069] his arrows are missing he has just a bow without arrows and so we believe and I'll try to support
[time=2076] this for you in a minute we believe that this describes a peaceful conquering a conquering
[time=2082] by peace and for peace it is an ideological victory it is a political victory it is a victory without weapon without warfare without bloodshed without destruction of human life it is a it is a worldwide peace that comes upon the earth as Christ opens the first seal
[time=2098] you say Russell why do you think that's true well a number of reasons the passage we looked
[time=2105] at in first thessalonians five who remember the people are saying peace peace and safety it is while they are crying out peace and safety that destruction will come upon them so the beginning of this tribulation period people have a false sense of assurance people have a false sense of peace I also believe that this first seal describes a time of worldwide
[time=2126] peace because Daniel 927 says that the antichrist will make a pact with Israel for peace and
[time=2133] it seems there he is representing the other nations of the world it seems as though the antichrist has come to a position of power where he can speak for the other nations of the world and grant to Israel a pact of peace and so the world seems to be at peace the
[time=2151] calm before the story utopia has come at last worldwide harmony worldwide cooperation no
[time=2158] more wars no more terrorism one great colossal global community of harmony that's where it
[time=2167] starts you say how in the world would that ever happen the world has never seen peace
[time=2173] like that the world has never been at peace with itself there have always been nations at war with other nations there have always been peoples at wars with other peoples what would bring you to the notion that this world could ever come to a place of worldwide peace
[time=2189] somebody once said the only time this world has known peace is when it was stopping to reload then that's true of history well just think with me for a minute I mean maybe there
[time=2203] are things already in place in our world today that would call us to or lead us to
[time=2209] a day of world peace as you know the the world gets smaller by the second we know today things
[time=2216] about other nations and other parts of the world and immediate response to its occurring there that we have never known before the whole vehicle of satellite television and all that that represents the fax machines the travel by jet aircraft they as you know
[time=2231] shrink us to what they call the global village we are all a part of each other we all share
[time=2237] each other's problems we are no longer isolated as the ancients were or even as people a hundred years ago were in this country from the other nations of the world we all watched the same war at the same time on the same television station in the Gulf conflict that never happened
[time=2253] before in the history of the world it posed difficulties for military confidentiality
[time=2259] and Bush at that time really was the spokesman for this new era he kept talking about a new era full of promise a time of peace for all peoples he was calling us to resist aggression
[time=2270] or it will destroy our freedoms and if you will remember his first efforts were to work through the united nations to somehow put pressure on this other nation without bloodshed
[time=2281] without war saying the real way to solve the world's problems today are not with military might they are through the various strategies that nations in coalition with each other can force peace because of economic concerns and food and fuel and just the raw necessity
[time=2297] to live because nations are now so interdependent upon each other Gorbachev spoke and I quote of a budding world order in which peaceful coexistence and mutual
[time=2308] cooperation based on goodwill will be universal norms the profits of that day the profits
[time=2315] who both of them have brought to us a whole new world a whole new a whole new composition
[time=2321] of world thought dawned in their administrations they were predicting this great day of worldwide
[time=2328] peace and we do look at the world today and we noticed that the concerns for food and
[time=2334] fuel and population explosion and the care of the environment and the sustaining of the economy as fragile as it may be are no longer viewed as one nation's problem but as all the nation's problems and so we talk about a global economy and a global food supply and a global environmental concern and so serious are these concerns and compelling that they
[time=2357] are driving the attention of world leaders away from military issues to just hanging on to life itself and cooperating so that the strengths of one can be enjoyed by all
[time=2369] and the weaknesses of some can be compensated by the other on a national level
[time=2376] we are an extensive international interdependence network the world has become a very small
[time=2382] place Robert Mueller with the United Nations for some 33 years and considered their great
[time=2389] profit of hope said this quote there will be no third world war between the big powers
[time=2396] instead a new age a new world a new genesis a true global god abiding political moral
[time=2405] and spiritual renaissance to make this planet at last what it always was meant to be the
[time=2411] planet of god here you have an unbeliever one who would speak like the antichrist one who would speak like one of the prophets who will be in in great number they will flourish
[time=2422] towards the end of the age and they will sing this song or one like it and they will propagate
[time=2429] a time of worldwide peace as the new order and the new day and they will finally have in their grasp utopia now obviously I'm not trying to suggest to you that these are the
[time=2442] days I don't know the days I don't know when they come I see the decay of our society and I see the the absolute shrinking of the world and this may be the day but I'm not here to tell you that these are the beginning false prophets who usher us into that and it will soon be raptured and that then this first seal will be open the Lord said in Matthew 24 that no man knows the day or the hour all I'm trying to describe these are the kinds
[time=2468] of factors these are the kinds of dynamics that are existing which can lead to our understanding of a worldwide peace a commitment to a worldwide peace and that's how this whole thing begins
[time=2482] this is the calm before the storm and you'll notice as we study through this fascinating that the world having tasted this world peace just once in this first seal as brief as it is having tasted it just once will spend the rest of the seven years believing they can get it back even though the world continues to degenerate they will continue to cry out
[time=2502] peace and safety they will continue to believe in their heart and their mind that somehow some way this total decay and destruction of the world as we know it it really must happen
[time=2512] because then we can get on with the old or get away from the old and get on with the new day so this really becomes the trap of Satan this is the way he lures the world into
[time=2522] thinking that man we had that peace for a moment and though everything is falling apart maybe that's okay maybe that's good maybe the destruction of the world as we have known it is necessary for us to get to this new day of peace and he'll perpetrate that lie because
[time=2536] he doesn't want people in the tribulation period coming to Christ now something they can hang on to they'll take a hold of this first seal the peace here in has a reason not to believe that what the Bible says is true that it is the end and I better come to Christ and so this will be the lie that is perpetrated by Satan and his false prophets
[time=2555] in the any Christ they'll hang on to that brief moment of peace at the beginning of the tribulation doesn't last long because the guy in charge is in heaven his name is
[time=2568] Jesus he's the worthy one he's the one who is slain yet standing and he holds in his hand to scroll and as easily as he opened the first one he'll then open the second one and look at it with me when he broke the second seal in verse three I heard the second living creature saying come and another red horse went out and to him who sat on it was granted to take peace from the earth that's another reason I believe the beginning of the tribulation starts with the first seal of peace because it is this red horse that takes the peace away what the earth had in peace it is now ripped out of their hands by the red horse
[time=2599] and the force that the red horse represents that men should slay one another and a great sword was given to him a great sword was given to him the red horse obviously a symbol
[time=2610] of blood the false peace is over and it falls apart the world society begins to degenerate
[time=2616] and they are now killing each other look at it in verse four that men should slay one another Ezekiel 38 21 says every man's sword will be against his brother speaking of the
[time=2626] same era so it's not just nation against nation now beginning to fight it's a war on a community level it's a war on a household level it's a war where brother takes brother's life war is the is the prevailing reality of the day the world is at war and the sword
[time=2647] there the makayra it's it's really an assassin sword it's great and its ability to do destruction
[time=2653] but it is small in in actual physical size it is the assassins dagger which also strengthens
[time=2661] the notion that this killing will not just be national you know fighting in wars it will be the individual murder and assassin one of another the world will be unleashed with
[time=2673] its murderous intent and the anger and the lust and the jealousy of men will run rampant
[time=2681] following on its heels is the third seal look at it in verses five and six and when he broke the third seal I heard the living creature saying come and I looked and behold
[time=2693] a black horse and he who said it said on it had a pair of scales in his hands and I heard
[time=2700] as it were a voice in the center of the four living creature saying a court of wheat for denarius and three courts of barley for denarius and do not harm the oil and the wine this
[time=2710] is famine this is describing the conditions of famine and the writer doesn't have a sword
[time=2719] the writer has instead the scales the scales which are measuring out what little you can
[time=2727] buy for your day's wage a denarius was typically a day's wage and you could only get a court
[time=2735] of wheat you could only get a enough to maybe feed yourself for one day you'd work all day
[time=2741] to get enough to eat for that day that's all you'd have these are famine conditions
[time=2747] which seems to be the obvious conclusion when war breaks out and everybody's involved in killing everybody and everybody's given themselves to the defense effort as it might be described
[time=2757] who works who produces food no one in famine strikes and people starve to death and then
[time=2768] the Lord up in heaven opens the fourth seal and that's found in verses 7 and 8 and when he broke the fourth seal I heard the voice of the four living creature saying come and I looked and behold an ashen horse and he who said on it had the name of death and Hades
[time=2783] was following with him and authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth the ashen
[time=2793] horse that's kind of a yellow green sickly color it's a it's the horse of sickness it's
[time=2800] the horse of pestilence it's the consequence of war followed by famine followed by death
[time=2808] followed by disease the world is diseased and it's the lives of those who live on the
[time=2814] world are being taken by disease maybe a pestilence such as AIDS would be able to account for such a great number of people dying notice in verse 8 it's a fourth of the earth that dies and they die by the sword the wars of the second seal they die of the famine the
[time=2830] consequence of the third seal and they die of the consequence of this the fourth seal the pestilence it is death it is the sickly yellow greenish look of death and notice also
[time=2843] they wild beasts get into the act the society is so degraded the man is so stripped of his
[time=2850] society and what we know today as your ability to care for yourself that even the wild beasts are having a field day and they are destroying and killing they are taking part in this great massacre and so a quarter of the world's population dies now this basically takes us to the end
[time=2873] of the first three and a half years these these basically there is the fifth seal that will look at next time which is the martyrdom of the people who have come to Christ in the tribulation but these these are descriptive of the turmoil and the crushing reality of the first three and a half years and if you would keep your finger there for a minute and come with me to Matthew 24 and I want you to see some of the same from the Lord Matthew 24 and 25 is called the Olivet Discourse because the Lord gave it while sitting on
[time=2909] the Mount of Olives Matthew 24 verse 3 he was sitting there on the Mount of Olives and the
[time=2915] disciples came to him privately with these questions tell us when will these things be
[time=2921] and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age they want to know man how does all these work out when does this happen and how will we know that it's coming what will the signs be well he answers the first question when over in verse 36 you might just look at that he says very clearly but of that day and hour no one knows nobody knows
[time=2945] stop asking me when I'm not going to tell you because nobody knows not even the angels of heaven nor the son I don't even know in my humanist I don't even know when the hour is only the father knows so these people who want to run around and set dates these people
[time=2961] who want to predict a particular year or tell us a particular decade or tell us that
[time=2967] this has got to happen now because this has happened and this has happened and this thing in Europe has gone on and while those are interesting and need to be looked at you always need to stop short of trying to say oh this is the day see this is the hour the Lord said
[time=2981] don't do that nobody knows and if anybody tells you they know the obvious implication is they're a liar the obvious implication is don't give yourself to try to figure that out the only thing he really says to us about that is that the day of the Lord is like a thief who comes in the night he comes suddenly and unexpectedly nobody's gonna know nobody's
[time=2999] gonna be able to figure out the exact time but back in verse 3 tell us when will these
[time=3006] things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age now that he does answer he does give some preliminary indicators and they parallel this first four seals of Revelation 6 look at verse 4 and Jesus answered and said to them see to it that
[time=3022] no one misleads you for many will come in my name saying I am the Christ and will mislead any will mislead many this is the great deception of the first seal and we don't have time this morning but if you looked at the message of the false prophets you would continually see them saying peace and safety you would continually hear them crying out peace and safety their job the job of these false Christ and these false prophets is to continue to lure the people into a false sense of assurance that what they had experienced in that false
[time=3052] peace at the beginning they can retrieve and so this great misleading is the first seal
[time=3059] then verse 6 and what you and you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars see that
[time=3066] you are not frightened for those things must take place but that is not yet the end in fact those wars are occurring there is war a worldwide war nation verse 7 will rise against
[time=3077] nation and kingdom against kingdom and in various places there will be what famine famine
[time=3083] is what followed war in Revelation 6 it's the third seal and earthquakes he adds but
[time=3091] all these things are merely what the beginning of birth pains these are the beginning of
[time=3099] birth pains this is just the start this is just the beginning this is the first three
[time=3105] and a half years now look at the verse 15 therefore when you see the abomination of
[time=3113] desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place let the reader understand in other words once that happens that's the midpoint then comes the great tribulation and when that happens run look at verse 16 then let those who are
[time=3126] in Judea flee to the mountains let him who was on the housetop not go down to get the things out that are in his house don't even pause to get your belongings just get out of there verse 18 and let him who was in the field not turned back to get his cloak but whoa to those who are with child and to those who nurse babes in those days in other words they're slowed down and they're flight from that place because they're pregnant and they got to feed their newborns verse 20 pray that your flight may not be in winter or on
[time=3154] the Sabbath because winter slows down your flight and so does the Sabbath if you're observing Sabbath law then verse 21 for then there will be a great tribulation such as has not occurred
[time=3165] since the beginning of the world until now nor ever shall and unless those days have been cut short no life would have been saved for the sake of the elect those days shall be cut short that is the basic division now back to Revelation chapter 6 what we find
[time=3189] in a revelation chapter 6 is this deceptive misleading ministry of the false prophets
[time=3195] and the false Christ and the anti-Christ they promise peace and they somehow make it happen
[time=3202] global concerns may draw people to a place of detente and they proclaim themselves the
[time=3208] ones who have finally given the world what it deserves a new age the utopia but they are not in control and Christ opens his second seal which is vast war that breaks out all
[time=3219] over the world all over the world in all the households which is followed by this great
[time=3225] famine which is followed by great pestilence and a quarter of the world is dead there
[time=3234] are some four billion plus people on the planet you know what it would be like over a short
[time=3240] period of time three and a half years to see a quarter a billion a billion people die
[time=3248] there haven't been a hundred million people die in all the wars of the ages phenomenal
[time=3255] phenomenal death and that's just the beginning that's just a warm up that's just the preliminary
[time=3264] birth pains of labor we haven't even started the big stuff the hard stuff the supernatural
[time=3273] you say is there any hope for the world no no there's absolutely no hope for the world
[time=3281] where is the world headed destruction will the vice president and those who are conscience
[time=3287] of the environment be able to save the world no God made this world a disposable world God
[time=3298] made this world a consumable world and he will dispose of it and he will consume it and when he is done he will make a new one you say is there any hope for the world no there any
[time=3313] hope for me there any hope for me yes yes listen to the words of the writer of Hebrew
[time=3319] is chapter two how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation if you come to Christ
[time=3327] if you know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior if you have confessed your sin
[time=3334] if you have said I have violated the glory of God I have fallen short I am worthy of death I cannot earn salvation I cannot do enough good works to benefit heaven and instead say
[time=3346] so give me the Savior give me the Christ give me the one who died in my stead and take him unto yourself then there is wonderful hope and you will not only not see the great tribulation or the birth pangs you will be raptured before all that with the rest of us who know Christ you will be in heaven watching all of this praising God as it all occurs you will miss
[time=3368] the terrible trouble that the earth will have and then you will also miss hell the eternal
[time=3374] damnation which awaits all who have not accepted Christ and so this morning a little bit like
[time=3381] Paul Revere on his famous midnight ride when he cried out the British are coming the British
[time=3388] are coming I would say to you the wrath of God is coming the wrath of God is coming I
[time=3396] don't know when it may be in our lifetime it may not be for another 2,000 years but the
[time=3403] sure message of the word of God is if you are alive today and you have heard the gospel and you know that wrath is coming today repent today humble yourself today come to Christ
