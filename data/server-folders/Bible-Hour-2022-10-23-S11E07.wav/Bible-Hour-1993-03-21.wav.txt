[time=0] In other words, God says you have violated me.
[time=14] I'm not defending the helpless or the orphan.
[time=18] And I'm not reluctantly pursuing you.
[time=20] I am aggressively pursuing you because you have not worshiped me, because you have not loved me, because you have not obeyed me.
[time=28] And because of that, I hate you and I will bring judgment on you and I will have no remorse.
[time=34] I will strike you in personal vengeance for not worshiping me.
[time=51] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=57] Thank you for joining us.
[time=58] The Bible says it is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[time=63] What does that mean?
[time=64] Isn't God love?
[time=65] Isn't God forgiving?
[time=67] Should God really be feared?
[time=69] Stay with us this morning as we study a passage of Scripture which describes people so terrified by God, we'll call out for the mountains and the rocks to fall on them.
[time=77] We encourage you to locate your Bible and have it open to the book of Revelation.
[time=81] We will be looking at chapter 6 verses 9 through 17.
[time=86] Our special music today includes a solo from Becky Wulman and Brian Loessen.
[time=96] Let's now join our service.
[time=116] [MUSIC - 396 seconds]

[time=542] So if you're watching this today in Fort Wayne, come and join us at 6 p.m. at the Blackhawk Baptist Church at 7400 East State right here in Fort Wayne.
[time=552] Join us for a delightful evening of music. And then I want to remind you that we still are offering the series of four tapes on the Christian in the face of the enemy.
[time=564] It's a series on Satan and Demonism that was presented by our pastor a number of months ago.
[time=572] If you'd like to receive this packet of tapes just right to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=584] I hope that you'll remember to send us a donation of $15 or more.
[time=588] Well, this is a special day in the life of Blackhawk Baptist Church. Once again, we've completed another building project, and I have in the studio with me, Steve Longbreak. Good morning, Steve.
[time=598] Hi, Pete.
[time=600] This has been a long, long, arduous task for you as you represented the staff in the church with the building committee, but now we have the dedication and your students have moved in.
[time=612] We're seeing the gymnasium. What a great day this is.
[time=616] It is a great day. We have seven through 12th graders now in our building, and that gives us a lot more space to grow as we begin to do that across the street in the elementary, looking forward to a high school twice this size.
[time=626] Well, I'm thankful for Blackhawk Christian School, and as you said, it gives us a chance to grow a little bit.
[time=632] What is the situation as we get into the spring of the year toward enrollment for next year?
[time=638] Right now we have openings in second grade through fifth grade for next year, so this year's present first graders through fourth grade, and we're looking really forward to a school that's going to be a lot bigger next year as we open up the enrollment for those grades.
[time=654] Then also in seventh through 12, we have one class that has openings, and those are students that will be in the eleventh grade next year. Everything else is full for next year, but we are looking forward to some additional eleventh graders for next year.
[time=666] Well, if you're interested in Christian education, you might want to call the church and the school office at 493-7400 and ask about the possibility of your student being involved at Blackhawk Christian School.
[time=680] It's a wonderful school. We're grateful for it, and we just thank God that he's allowed us to have more facilities so that we can expand Christian education in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=690] Well, we're going to go back to the live portion of our service now with some more music, and then the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=698] I really do encourage you to stay tuned each week as Pastor Moore is in a series in Revelation. Let's join the live portion of our service right now.
[time=720] [MUSIC - 178 seconds]
[time=918] Whenever I say thanks to Brian for singing, I always feel like I should say to my deepest, richest thank you Brian.
[time=928] Hi, I love your voice and Scott, welcome back. Good to have you back. Wonderful, guys. Thank you.
[time=934] Tremendous song. Well, I'm excited to be here with you this morning.
[time=938] I hope you're anticipating what God would instruct us from his word.
[time=942] And if you have your Bible, take your Bible and turn to Revelation chapter 6.
[time=946] And we come to this phenomenal passage of Scripture that I must confess has blessed my heart this week.
[time=954] I feel like I've learned things about God that I didn't understand before and know.
[time=958] And that's always a thrill and I trust God will do the same in our time in your heart.
[time=964] If you're visiting with us, it might be helpful for you to know that we're studying the book of Revelation.
[time=968] It's a book of prophecy. It tells us about the future.
[time=972] And particularly about how the world is going to end, God's final day of judgment upon the earth.
[time=978] And we have been studying through this book as is our practice.
[time=982] We'll pick a book and just work our way through the text as it comes and preach it as best as we can.
[time=988] And we come this morning to verses 9 through 17 in Revelation chapter 6.
[time=996] And just to set the scene for you a little bit, a man by the name of John, he was an apostle and he had been exiled.
[time=1002] This is in the period of the early church about 90 AD.
[time=1006] He had been put on to an island exiled there because of his Christian faith.
[time=1010] He was discouraged and the church was faltering and all of his buddies had been martyred already for the gospel.
[time=1016] And while he is there, really imprisoned on this rocky piece of turf out in the middle of the ocean there,
[time=1024] he receives a vision from God.
[time=1026] God takes him, in fact, in this vision to the very throne room of heaven in Revelation chapter 4.
[time=1030] And there he sees God enthroned upon this marvelous throne.
[time=1036] And God is holding out his hand, and in his hand there's a scroll, an ancient document wrapped up as they do tightly like that.
[time=1044] And then there are seven seals, probably along the outside of this scroll.
[time=1050] And these seven seals indicate that it's not to be opened by just anybody.
[time=1054] It's a private document and in fact it is the deed, the title deed of the earth.
[time=1058] It is the document that will allow it to be taken back from the usurper Satan and the penalty of sin and the curse of death and disease
[time=1066] and all the things that we know and hate about the traumatic parts of our life.
[time=1072] Sin and death and sickness and murder and rape and all the stuff that goes on in our world.
[time=1078] This is the title deed of the earth, this is the thing that takes all that back and rectifies all those wrongs.
[time=1084] And a question is asked there in that throne room, who is worthy to take the scroll?
[time=1090] And it says nobody's worthy, nobody steps forward, nobody at all, in heaven and on earth steps forward, who is worthy and able to take the scroll.
[time=1096] And so John overwhelmed with the grief that this sin and death will continue to go on, begins to weep uncontrollably.
[time=1104] For full of sorrow, but he is instructed to look behind him and when he looks behind him he sees the one who is able to take the scroll.
[time=1112] It is a little lamb in Arneas, it's a little lamb who has been dead but who is standing, who is slain but is standing.
[time=1120] And it's speaking about Christ, the Lamb of God, who was crucified and has risen again.
[time=1126] And Christ comes in that scene and takes the scroll out of the hand of God, and he is now opening the scroll, seal by seal, all seven seals.
[time=1136] And this period of time is known as the tribulation.
[time=1140] This is at the end of the earth, or the history of the earth, it's a seven year period.
[time=1146] The first three and a half years are called birth pangs by our Lord in Matthew 24.
[time=1152] And it's a wonderful picture of what is happening because as you remember birth pangs start rather mild and they have some distance between them.
[time=1160] But then as the delivery process progresses they become far more painful and they become far more frequent until finally the great event occurs of the birth.
[time=1168] And that is what our Lord is describing about this time of the world, the seven year tribulation.
[time=1172] These birth pangs will happen somewhat mild at the beginning and somewhat distant one from the other.
[time=1178] But as we move towards the end of that seven year period the pain becomes far more intense and far more frequent until a great event, not the birth of a baby, but the coming of the Lord himself to take the earth back.
[time=1190] So he speaks of it in Matthew 24 as the first three and a half years being the beginning birth pangs.
[time=1196] And then the great abomination of desolation, the antichrist himself, who goes into the temple and says, "I am God and demands to be worshiped."
[time=1202] And that inaugurates the second three and a half years which our Lord called in Matthew 24 the great tribulation.
[time=1208] And that is when it picks up in pace and intensity and it's a horrible, horrible time.
[time=1216] We have been looking at Revelation 6 which in these first eight verses describes the first half of the tribulation, the beginning birth pangs.
[time=1224] And they began with a world peace, the first seal represented by a white horse, these are the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
[time=1232] And the white horse represented peace, worldwide peace.
[time=1236] We believe that because he had a bow with no arrows, but he was a great conqueror and so politically and ideologically he was able to bring the world to a place of absolute peace, which as you know the world has been hoping for for a long time.
[time=1248] But it is a false peace. It is a peace that is led by the antichrist himself, one who is energized by Satan and so soon it falls apart and crumbles.
[time=1258] And the second horse or the second seal brings war.
[time=1262] He is a red horse to symbolize the blood and the death of war.
[time=1266] And that is followed by a third horse who is a black horse and the rider carries scales to indicate the famine that comes across the earth and people are starving to death.
[time=1276] And then a fourth seal is opened by Christ back up in heaven and it releases a fourth horse who is an ashen horse, which is a sickly color, kind of a yellowish green.
[time=1286] And that horse represents pestilence and the death that comes.
[time=1292] And you can see in verse eight that by this time a fourth of the earth of the population has died.
[time=1298] In today's terms that would be over a billion people. In a three and a half year period are dead.
[time=1304] Because Christ is in heaven and he is opening seal after seal after seal and what we read in that seal happens on earth.
[time=1312] And this morning we'll have the privilege of looking at the fifth and the sixth seal.
[time=1318] When we move to the fifth seal we leave planet earth.
[time=1322] It's no longer a focus of worldwide peace and war and famine and death.
[time=1326] We'll go back to heaven and we'll see something there.
[time=1328] And the focal point of the fifth seal is prayer. It is a seal all about prayer.
[time=1334] Look at it with me. Verses nine through eleven.
[time=1338] And when he broke the fifth seal I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had maintained.
[time=1348] And they cried out with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true wilt out refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth.
[time=1358] And there was given to each of them a white robe and they were told they should rest for a little while longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been should be completed also.
[time=1372] So three verses the fifth seal all about prayer and let me kind of frame our thinking this morning by asking three questions and trying to answer them about prayer.
[time=1380] Who is praying first of all and then secondly what are they praying for and then thirdly how does God answer their prayer.
[time=1388] Three simple questions about prayer who is praying what are they praying for and how does God answer.
[time=1394] The first question is answered in verse nine who is praying and when he broke the fifth seal I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had maintained.
[time=1406] I believe that these are the souls of the Christians who have been killed during this tribulation period.
[time=1416] These are people who from the beginning of the tribulation from this time of after the rapture of the church then this worldwide peace and war and famine and pestilence people in this period of time are coming to Christ.
[time=1428] And they are coming to Christ because of the witness of the 144,000 they are coming to Christ because the word of God is still on planet earth and people are reading it and coming to the reality that they need to come to Christ.
[time=1440] And when they are coming to Christ they are standing and saying look what is happening in our world what is going on here is just an evidence of the judgment of God this is near the end of the world.
[time=1450] And the world at that time does not want to hear that message the false prophets are running all through the earth saying that this that this peace and war and famine and now death these are these are we have to kind of go through all this stuff to get to a new age of everlasting peace.
[time=1464] And we will do that following the antichrist follow us and the Christians are saying no that's not what this is this is the judgment of God upon this planet.
[time=1474] And so because of their testimony to the word of God as it says in verse 9 and the testimony which they maintain this endurance they are put to death.
[time=1484] You'll notice verse 9 says it's just the souls that appear there which leads me to believe that these are the folks who have come to Christ in the tribulation and died in the tribulation because the raptured church has bodies.
[time=1496] First John 3 says that when we see him we'll be like him and we'll see him at the rapture which is already transpired and so if it were the church praying these prayers if it were the martyred saints of the church age it wouldn't be souls it would be the bodies or the people.
[time=1514] These saints who have died in the tribulation and who here are disembodied who do not have their bodies will later receive their body bodies with all the Old Testament saints at a later time in this book and we'll get there.
[time=1526] So these are a group of people who are martyred during the tribulation because of their bold and consistent faith and proclamation of the word of God.
[time=1538] Second question what are they praying for? What are they asking? Well look at verse 10 and they cried out with a loud voice saying how long O Lord holy and true wilt thou refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth.
[time=1552] And this leads us for a minute this morning to discuss the vengeance of God.
[time=1560] What you see here are some saints who are saying defend us, avenge us, right the wrong that has been done against us and you'll see that often in scripture when God moves in vengeance.
[time=1572] He does so as a defender it is a defending vengeance.
[time=1576] You can read about his protection of the orphan and the widow.
[time=1580] God has a place in his heart for the helpless and the innocent and he defends them.
[time=1584] He said of Israel you are the apple of my eye as if to warn all the nations of the world and when you touch Israel you touch a very sensitive part of my anatomy.
[time=1594] I feel it and I will respond.
[time=1596] We recognize that God is the defender of the glory of Christ and God will work great judgment as we'll see as this passage develops.
[time=1604] Upon the earth for not worshiping his son Christ and he has said every knee will bow and every tongue will confess and God will bring that judgment to make those people confess.
[time=1614] And so we see God in a role as a defending vengeance and we're comfortable I guess with that role.
[time=1622] We also see God's vengeance almost as reluctant at points.
[time=1626] He is a reluctant avenger.
[time=1628] It says in the word of God that he takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked.
[time=1632] And so we see him moving in vengeance but in his heart it's hard and he wished he didn't have to do it.
[time=1638] Other passages say that God is not willing that any should perish but all should come to repentance.
[time=1644] That also is a little easier for me to accept.
[time=1650] When I see God in defending vengeance and I see God in reluctant vengeance there's room for me to think that through and understand that and have a certain level of personal comfort.
[time=1658] But there is another picture that I discovered as I was studying this of God not in reluctant and not in defense but in personal vengeance.
[time=1668] In personal vengeance. What I mean to say is this.
[time=1672] God has vengeance in his heart against humanity because they have not loved him not in defense of the orphan the widow or Christ.
[time=1682] Just simply because they have not loved him.
[time=1686] There is in his heart vengeance and death and destruction and eternal damnation that he will exact upon them because they did not love him.
[time=1698] Listen to the words of Deuteronomy 3241 for a minute.
[time=1702] He says there I will render vengeance on my adversaries and I will repay those who hate me.
[time=1710] There is no middle ground with God.
[time=1712] People think there is people say oh I've never been mean to God and I've never really cursed God and I don't think he's a horrible thing I just don't love him.
[time=1718] God interprets that as you hate me.
[time=1720] God demands absolute total love and submission from the created human being.
[time=1726] Anything short of that he says you hate me.
[time=1728] It almost sounds irrational on human terms.
[time=1732] You either love me there is no neutral ground if you don't love me you hate me and if you hate me I will repay you.
[time=1738] I consider you my enemy and I will repay you.
[time=1742] So if you're taking notes you might put this down.
[time=1744] If you fail to love me God says you are one my enemy and I will repay you with vengeance.
[time=1750] It's a personal vendetta.
[time=1752] Micah 515 says this and I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath on the nations which have not obeyed.
[time=1760] So he goes even a step further.
[time=1762] Not only must you obey me but you must obey me and failure to obey me brings out wrath and anger in my heart against you.
[time=1778] If you hold your place in Revelation come with me to the words of Isaiah.
[time=1782] Isaiah chapter 63 and you'll see this picture even more clearly and I must confess this is somewhat troubling.
[time=1794] Isaiah 63 and he is describing here God's great wrath upon Edom but it pictures God's wrath upon the whole world.
[time=1804] Isaiah 63 verse 3 and 4 verses 3 and 4 listen to this now.
[time=1810] Isaiah 63 and 3 I have trodden the wine trough alone and from the peoples there was no man with me.
[time=1820] I also trod them in my anger and trample them in my wrath and their life blood is sprinkled on my garments and I stained all my remnant
[time=1832] for the day of vengeance was in my heart.
[time=1836] This is not the picture of a reluctant avenger who is saying I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked
[time=1842] and I just must do this as a faithful judge to keep justice.
[time=1848] This is not the picture of a defending God who says you have failed to worship my son and for his benefit and for his glory and for his honor I will bring judgement upon you.
[time=1856] This is the picture of a God and you see the garments referenced here if you go back to Isaiah 59-17 it says that he puts on his garment of wrath.
[time=1868] God is saying in his heart you have failed to love me absolutely totally exclusively.
[time=1874] You have failed to obey me and I am so full of personal vengeance and personal vendetta and anger against you that I clothe myself in garments of vengeance
[time=1886] and I step on to the wine press and you know the picture of little grapes lying on the floor there and he is dressed in his garb and he walks through this place stamping out life
[time=1898] and as the grapes explode and fall upon the juices upon the garment of the one who would do that
[time=1906] so he pictures the very blood of life the life blood of humanity sprinkling and splattering itself upon the garments of his wrath
[time=1914] and when he is done with all of that he doesn't say I am sorry he doesn't say I had to do that he doesn't say there was no alternative he says for the day of vengeance was in my heart.
[time=1926] That's tough.
[time=1930] That is a difficult picture of God to comprehend.
[time=1936] Do you want to know why I find it so difficult?
[time=1938] Because if those same attributes are found in a human we lock them up.
[time=1942] If a human says to another human you don't love me the person says but I like you but you don't love me and I demand absolute love
[time=1952] and you have not obeyed me and I demand absolute obedience and because of that I go into my home and I put on my clothes of murder
[time=1960] and now properly attired to murder you I wipe you out I destroy you and your blood is on my garment
[time=1968] and when I am done I stand over your dead corpse and I say that is exactly what I had in my heart to do and I have no remorse
[time=1976] that person is psychotic right that is called a sicko that is called somebody who has broken with reality
[time=1984] that is somebody we tie up in a straight jacket and put in a place somewhere never to be released and if we follow through with the word of God's commitment to capital punishment
[time=1992] we take that person's life interesting isn't it?
[time=1998] The exact same motive action and attributes found in the human are gross and ugly and worthy of death
[time=2008] but those same attributes and actions found in the very person of God or make him an object of worship.
[time=2016] Friends let me say it to you this way we are not like God and God is not like us.
[time=2024] God is different. God in the theological terminology is what we call transcendent.
[time=2032] God is transcendent which doesn't just mean he's higher than we are it means he is other than we are.
[time=2038] And one of the greatest examples of that is this very reality that vengeance is right, vengeance is a part of the glory of God
[time=2048] when he strikes in personal vendetta we worship him for that when we see it in the human created creature we put that person to death.
[time=2056] A.W. Tozer said on this point we must not think of God as highest in an ascending order of beings starting with the single cell and going on up from the fish to the bird to the animal to the angel to the cherub to God.
[time=2072] This would be to God to grant God imminence even preeminence but that is not enough. We must grant him transcendence in the fullest meaning of that word forever God stands apart in light unapproachable.
[time=2086] He is as high above an archangel as above a caterpillar for the gulf that separates the archangel from the caterpillar is but finite why the gulf between God and the archangel is infinite.
[time=2100] The caterpillar and the archangel though far removed from each other in the scale of created things are nevertheless one in that they are alike created.
[time=2112] They both belong in the category of that which is not God and are separated from God by infinitude itself.
[time=2122] Striking truth. A striking truth. What is ugly. What is gross. What is worthy of death. What would be considered prideful arrogance.
[time=2136] To suggest that a human would say to another human you don't love me totally and obey me totally therefore I will put on my garments of vengeance and destroy your life and when I am done I'll say I had it in my heart and you deserved it.
[time=2146] But to see God saying the exact same things because he is other. You say how other. What do you mean by other. Come back with me for a minute to revelation.
[time=2158] And I kind of mentioned this to you as we were moving through this passage of scripture but Revelation chapter 4 is the great pay on of praise before the great destruction of the earth.
[time=2170] And the angel in verse 8 the angels the four living creatures who have eyes their full of eyes around and within in other words they are very aware of what has transpired in human history and they are very aware of what is coming in this great day of wrath.
[time=2182] What do they say. Verse 8 holy holy holy is the Lord God the Almighty who was and who is and who is to come.
[time=2194] The word holy does not just mean separate from sin the Hebrew root word there is to be cut or to be separate and it just doesn't mean separate from sin it means separate from all that is created.
[time=2206] To be holy is to be separate from all that is created God is totally other than the created order he is not the highest point on the created order he is other than the created order.
[time=2216] And that's what it says in verse 8 look at it again holy holy holy is the Lord God the Almighty who was and who is and who is to come his self existence is put on display.
[time=2228] There was never a time when God wasn't there will never be a time when he isn't he was never created he had no beginning he just always was and because of that fact he is transcendent he is other.
[time=2238] He is separate he is not like you he is not like me he is not like the angels he is totally distinct and separate and he wants to be worshiped in light of that.
[time=2254] Look also the praise of worship in verse 11 this time not from the angels but from the redeemed church the raptured church who surrounds him.
[time=2266] For thou didst create all things and because of thy will they existed and were created he is other because he is the creator.
[time=2278] Everything else is the product of his hand he stands alone he stands alone and so as we come now turn back if you will to Revelation 6.
[time=2292] Remember this fifth seal comes basically at the end of the first three and a half years and it is kind of starting here at the end of the first three and a half years and running its way into the rest of the three and a half years before this real devastating judgment comes again we are reminded
[time=2306] that God is worthy God is to be worshiped because of the destruction that he is about to bring upon the earth.
[time=2318] While that is true let me just read you a familiar passage.
[time=2326] I want to remind you that while God is justified in his vengeance and even while these saints these these folks now who are in heaven and who are praying and perfect consistent with the Word of God and the will of God they are praying that God will wipe out the unbelievers on the earth.
[time=2340] That heart should never be found in us Romans 12 let me just read it to you.
[time=2348] Never take your own revenge beloved never take your own revenge beloved but leave room for the wrath of God for it is written vengeance his mind I will repay says the Lord.
[time=2360] But if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him a drink for in so doing you will heat burning coals upon his head do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good.
[time=2370] Let's look at that last question there how were they answered what was the answer to their prayer verse 11 and there was given to each of them a white robe speaking of purity.
[time=2380] And they were told that they should rest for a little while longer and tell the number of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed even as they had been should be completed also.
[time=2390] There's there's God always answers prayer it's always one of three answers yes no or wait and that's what this one is wait wait wait for what wait for your brothers and sisters in Christ who are yet on the planet who are yet going through the tribulation to lose their lives to be killed.
[time=2408] It's all a part of God's plan.
[time=2412] So who is praying people who have come to Christ in the tribulation period and have been faithful to the testimony of the word of God and have been slain for their faith.
[time=2422] What are they praying for the vengeance of God to come upon those who dwell upon the earth which is a technical term in the book of Revelation which always means the unregenerate living on the earth during the tribulation.
[time=2436] What is the answer to their prayer wait a day is coming but not yet and that brings us then to the sixth seal.
[time=2446] Look at this will you unbelievable.
[time=2450] The sixth seal covers verses 12 to 17 and in the sixth seal the human agent disappears no longer is it man made peace man made war man made famine man made pestilence no longer are men and issue at all.
[time=2464] God at this point acts independently and directly upon the earth without the human agent.
[time=2472] It is the direct intervention of God and if the fifth seal is all about prayer the sixth seal is all about fear terror it is absolutely full of terror people are scared to death.
[time=2486] And for the first time in the book of Revelation we get to hear from the people who are living on the earth during the tribulation and will listen to their words as we progress.
[time=2496] But let me say this first by way of organizing our thoughts I'll ask three more questions about the fear represented in the sixth seal number one what are they afraid of what's everybody so afraid of.
[time=2506] The second question is is anybody not afraid are there some brave courageous souls out there that don't get frightened at all by what is happening and the third question is what is the response to their fear.
[time=2520] First question what are they afraid of.
[time=2524] Verse 12 and I looked when he broke the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair and the whole moon became like blood and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
[time=2542] And the sky was split apart like a scroll when it's rolled up and every mountain and island was removed out of their places.
[time=2550] This is a great shaking a great it says in verse 12 earthquake and I don't believe that's the best translation of that Greek word size must from which we get our word seismograph which is the instrument we use to measure shaking.
[time=2564] The Greek word there is an earthquake it's just shaking it's a great shaking.
[time=2570] The same word is used in Matthew 824 of not an earthquake at all it's the shaking that happened with Jesus and his disciples in a great storm.
[time=2578] I believe this will be better translated there was a great shaking and maybe even better than that a great universe shaking.
[time=2586] And I'll try to show you that as we go there are five absolutely phenomenal disturbances that follow our result of this great shaking of the universe.
[time=2594] The first is found in verse 12 and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair.
[time=2600] Sackcloth was the mourners garb it was a black cloth and the hair reference there and this time would have been the black hair of a goat that would have been woven into a garment that a person would wear to a funeral.
[time=2612] What he's saying here is the sun went out the sun was covered we couldn't see it it was black.
[time=2618] And we don't know exactly what causes that this great shaking of the earth and the universe may cause the earth to have great volcanic eruptions spewing out vast quantities of dust and particles that fill the upper atmosphere.
[time=2638] Which may make it impossible to see the sun because of all the gases and dust particles that are between us and the sun or it may be that the sun itself is shaken in this great moment.
[time=2648] And it's bumped out of its normal orbit and it begins to be fractured and whatever it is that the sun is made out of begins to burn itself up and spew out smoke so that it smokes itself and cannot be seen.
[time=2662] The next great disturbance that happens is the whole moon in the end of verse 12 became like blood and people suggest that this is a great eclipse.
[time=2674] Somehow the moon is eclipsed and around the edges of the eclipse comes a red glow that makes it look as if it were blood.
[time=2682] But the point is this when these two things happen when the sun gets black and the moon goes to blood red life as everybody knows it ceases to exist there is no more daylight there is no more night light.
[time=2694] There are no more tides there are no more agriculture or animal world is upset the nocturnal animals and the daytime animals and the whole system of man is taken and shaken apart and everything that everybody counts on on a regular basis that in the morning the sun will come up.
[time=2710] All stops happening. Absolutely unavoidable pitch black darkness.
[time=2716] And out of this darkness in verse 13 the stars of the sky fall to the earth as stare is the word in the Greek and it doesn't have to mean an actual star and we know our stars to be millions of times larger than the sun and if one of them were ever to hit the earth it would be instant annihilation.
[time=2732] The Greek word there allows for stars but it also allows for smaller items that orbit out in space like asteroids or comets or meteorites and there is a plummeting of the earth with them.
[time=2748] Look at it at verse 13 the analogy that is brought to light as a fig tree casts its unright figs when shaken by a great wind and fig trees are capable of being just loaded to the gills with their figs and when a great wind comes and hits them they just drop them all.
[time=2762] The earth is just plummeted when they drop.
[time=2766] And so there is a great great plummeting of the earth fireballs coming out of the darkness careening out of space and crushing and smashing into planet earth.
[time=2776] Verse 14 gives another the fourth phenomenon that happens as a result of the shaking the sky was split apart like a scroll when it's rolled up.
[time=2788] The sky just splits it's as if you've got a part of the scroll in this hand and a part of the scroll in this hand and you're trying to read it and it just splits and goes just wraps up on itself.
[time=2798] It just disappears it's rolled up and scrolls will do that with use and age they dry out you enroll them and they try to then they just split on you and go back to their original form.
[time=2816] And then look at verse 14 the fifth phenomena every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
[time=2824] Folks you want to know about an earthquake this is the earthquake it's when the mountains and the islands themselves begin to be moved out of their places not just like jiggled a little bit but moved out of their places.
[time=2840] I guess we could stop right here for a moment and just say a brief word to the environmentalists.
[time=2848] If you think man is hard on the planet just look at what God is going to do to the planet.
[time=2856] God whether they know it or not has made this planet a disposable planet it is a consumable item and he is in the process of doing with it exactly that.
[time=2866] He is going to destroy the earth and this is just the beginning of it.
[time=2870] And I can just hear the skeptic saying this now this is phenomenal you have gone too far preacher boy you need to understand this must be some type of symbolism here.
[time=2878] This can't happen to the earth this is impossible you're nuts relax get a different interpretation of the text or throw it away altogether but don't say that's going to happen to the end of the world.
[time=2892] To which I just might respond.
[time=2898] In the November 92 news week edition pictured on the front of this magazine was a picture of the earth and an asteroid heading straight for the earth.
[time=2910] The cover was this doomsday science new theories about comets asteroids and how the world might end.
[time=2920] Inside the cover it the teaser said this on March 23rd 1989 an asteroid a half a mile across half a mile wide missed the earth by just 700,000 miles sounds like one of my golf shots.
[time=2936] And in golf that's a big miss but when you're talking about space that is alarmingly close 700,000 miles it continues no one saw it coming.
[time=2948] If it had arrived a mere six hours later it might have wiped out civilization astronomers are scurrying to start a census of just what threats lurk in the solar system.
[time=2958] And as the pace of discovery picks up so should the pace of any earthlings heart.
[time=2964] Quote earth runs its course about the sun in a swarm of asteroids says astronomer Donald Yeomans of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
[time=2976] Again the quote sooner or later our planet will be struck by one of them.
[time=2982] The article opens up this way. It comes screaming out of the sky like a scud from hell bigger than a mountain and packed with more energy than the world's entire nuclear arsenal.
[time=2994] It hits the atmosphere at a hundred times the velocity of a speeding bullet and less than a second later smacks into the ground with an explosive force of 100 million megatons of TNT.
[time=3006] The shockwave from the crash landing traveling 20,000 miles an hour levels everything within 150 miles.
[time=3012] Simultaneously a plume of vaporized stone shoots up from the impact site blasting a hole through the atmosphere inventing hot debris.
[time=3022] The vaporized rock cools condensing back into hundreds of millions of tiny stones as they streak to the ground over the next hour they heat up and soon the very air grows hot pink.
[time=3036] Steam hisses from green leaves buildings and even trees burst into flame nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere combined into nitric acid any surviving life crawling out of a burrow or cave gets pelted with a rain as caustic as the acid in a car battery.
[time=3056] That's what astronomer Henry Mullish of the University of Arizona calculates what happened if something six miles across fell from space and smacked into the earth.
[time=3066] Scientists say that if an asteroid with a diameter not six miles across 30 to 300 feet across 30 to 300 feet across were to crash into the earth's atmosphere this is what would happen.
[time=3080] It would explode five miles above the earth with a force of 12 megatons it would annihilate reindeer 30 miles away.
[time=3088] It would ignite a man's clothing on fire 60 miles away and it would level more than 700 square miles of forest.
[time=3096] You say why do they say that would happen because it already did over the Siberian forest in 1908 that's exactly what happened.
[time=3110] Dr. Morris a Christian creation scientist commenting on the mountains and the island being moved out of their places says this.
[time=3118] The earth's crust highly unstable ever since the great flood will be so disturbed by the impacting asteroids the volcanic explosions and the earthquakes that great segments of it will actually begin to slip and slide over the earth's deep plastic mantle.
[time=3136] Geophysicists have been fascinated for many years with the idea of continental drift several have published theories of a past naturalistic catastrophism involving what they call the earth's shifting crust.
[time=3150] Some such phenomena may actually be triggered under the judgment of the six seal dwarfing the damage occasioned by all the mighty earthquakes of the past.
[time=3158] The second question we said we try to ask an answer is anybody not afraid.
[time=3162] Does anybody stand up in courage against this great day of catastrophe look at verse 15 and the kings of the earth and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and every slave and every free man hid themselves
[time=3178] in caves and among the rocks of the mountains what's he saying there was got basically two groups of people he's got kings great men commanders rich and strong.
[time=3188] That's the first group of people they're the mighty they are the noble of this world they are the powerful of this world and then he grabs everybody else all of us the slaves and the free men.
[time=3200] In other words all of humanity everybody on the earth whether great or small rich or poor will run and hide themselves in the caves and among the rocks.
[time=3214] Question number three what is their response how do they handle it what do they say what do they do.
[time=3222] Look at verse 16 and when they and they said to the mountains and to the rocks fall on us and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of their wrath is common who is able to stay.
[time=3238] This is a suicide wish this is the world's largest prayer meeting but they're not praying to God they're praying to the rocks and they're praying to the mountains and they're saying fall on us folks that means kill me.
[time=3250] White me out let me somehow escape the wrath of the lamb which is so interesting out of their own mouth they know and confess this is the wrath of the lamb and instead of repenting they wish for death.
[time=3268] Let me just give you a closing thought as we wrap our time up this morning.
[time=3278] It's true that fear is a normal natural thing that God has given to us we need to be fearful of coming too close to the edge of a cliff.
[time=3288] We need to be fearful of being run over by a car those kinds of things keep us sharp and alert their self preserving their normal their natural.
[time=3298] Our world today is full of people who go way beyond natural fear and explode into all kinds of phobias.
[time=3306] Incredible fear about a color incredible fear irrational fear about the size of a room or the height that they are at or a cat or a spider they are immobilized and irrationally consumed with fear over those kinds of things.
[time=3324] But I would hasten to add the unsaved humanity are rarely afraid of the one they should really be afraid of.
[time=3336] Conspicuously absent in the hearts of people in America today is a terrifying overwhelming immobilizing irrational fear of God himself.
[time=3350] You just don't see it.
[time=3354] Hebrews 1031 it is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[time=3362] And I might say this passage is instructive to we who are believers for I would say also conspicuously absent in my own life and maybe in yours would be that foreboding fear of God.
[time=3374] Maybe we have major too much on the Abba fathers of the New Testament that you are now my friends of the New Testament and thrown away the beginning of wisdom which is the fear of God.
[time=3386] A. W. Tozer drawing this idea of transcendence and fear together speaking of the saints of old said this.
[time=3392] In olden days mid of faith were said to walk in the fear of God and to serve in the fear of God.
[time=3402] However intimate their communion with God however bold their prayers at the base of their religious life was the conception of God as awesome and dreadful.
[time=3416] Our music today has come to you from the sanctuary choir and soloist Becky woman and Brian Lowson.
[time=3424] The message today was a continuation of a series of messages by our pastor teacher Russell Moore from the book of Revelation.
[time=3432] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3440] Dear Heavenly Father I'm thankful that you sent your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3448] Today I know that I have a need for you to come into my heart and be my Savior today.
[time=3452] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed. In Jesus name I pray Amen.
[time=3460] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3464] When you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
