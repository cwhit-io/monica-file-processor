[time=0] So on the whole, the evangelistic effort of the church is slow going, it's one step at
[time=15] a time, it's two steps backwards, it's nine years and fifty converts.
[time=19] But there are those very brief spots in human history where the outpouring of the Spirit of God provokes a conversion at a pace and to a scope that is definitely unusual.
[time=43] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=49] Thank you for joining us.
[time=51] There is a great awakening coming, a world revival like nothing we have ever seen before.
[time=56] There will be an international harvest of souls that will exceed and scope in numbers anything in human history.
[time=63] Huge numbers of people from all over the globe will be coming to Christ.
[time=68] This coming great world revival is described in Revelation chapter 7.
[time=73] Stay with us for an exciting look at the saving grace of God which will transform the lives of millions of people.
[time=80] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation chapter 7.
[time=87] Our special music today will be provided by Keith and Starr Braddocken.
[time=95] Let's now join our series.
[time=122] The Lord of the Ages is filling its ages with His everlasting grace.
[time=129] One by one he enters the gate, composed who are saved by grace.
[time=137] We shall sing heaven for all the musicians were ready to play.
[time=165] We shall sing heaven for all the musicians who are saved by grace.
[time=274] We are thankful for those letters and cards that come in just letting us know that you
[time=284] are out there.
[time=285] Appreciate the music too of our sanctuary choir and orchestra.
[time=287] I hope they were a blessing to you.
[time=289] We are going to be hearing from Keith and Starr Braddocken in just a few minutes.
[time=294] Pastor Russ, it has been a great time around here as we just moved into our new facility.
[time=300] We watched the A-B-F's and the school involved, what a tremendous blessing that new building is going to be.
[time=306] That's always an exciting time when a church has an opportunity to open up a whole new phase, an educational wing for us with a gymnasium.
[time=314] We're just really thanking the Lord for the momentum and the excitement and the joy that fills our church as we move forward for the cause of Christ.
[time=323] We just want to encourage you again if you're watching us and you don't have a church home, come and visit us at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=329] Not only do we have our worship service, but we have a great adult Bible fellowship where
[time=335] people meet together not only to study the word but to fellowship together and it's a great encouragement.
[time=341] I hope you'll come and visit Blackhawk Baptist Church when you get an opportunity.
[time=345] I also want to talk about a guest that we're going to have on our Sunday morning broadcast on April 18th.
[time=352] Russ Bob Vernon is a friend of yours, just a tremendous man, has a great testimony for the Lord.
[time=358] Tell us a little bit about his background.
[time=360] Well when you think about great men of God and you think about a man like Joseph or Daniel who stood for their Christian faith in a secular setting, that's Bob Vernon.
[time=371] He would be from that type of ministry.
[time=375] He was never in full-time ministry in the pastorate, but his ministry was the Los Angeles Police Department, served there for over 20 years and finished up as the Assistant Police Chief overseeing 6,000 men, was involved in all the Los Angeles riots as of late and through this entire ministry has had a strong testimony for the cause of Christ and we're excited he'll be with us to preach in church as well as to speak at our men's retreat.
[time=400] I know the men's retreat is going to be a great time for our own men.
[time=404] I know that's full, but I just remind the people again that Bob Vernon will be with us on our broadcast on Sunday morning April 18th and if you would like to come and be
[time=416] a part of the service we'd welcome you at our services at 915 and 1050.
[time=422] Both services are exactly alike so you have the opportunity to come at either time.
[time=427] And then we've been talking to you and this will be the last Sunday that we will offer to you the series of tapes called "The Christian in the Face of the Enemy".
[time=435] This was the four messages presented by our pastor a number of months ago on Satan and demons.
[time=442] We want to offer this to you for the last time today.
[time=445] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400E state, Fort Wayne, Indiana and
[time=452] the zip code is 46815.
[time=455] Once again that's the Bible Hour at 7400E state, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code
[time=461] is 46815.
[time=464] The suggested donation for these tapes is $15.
[time=469] We also want to talk a little bit about our Easter time.
[time=472] This is a great time in the life of Christians when we celebrate the death and of course the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we're also one of the great programs that I really enjoy.
[time=482] We've done it for a number of years as a good Friday service on Friday April 9th.
[time=487] You'll be speaking and how do you respond to the death of Christ and how does that...
[time=494] Well that service in particular, that's going to be 1215 to 1245 right here in our church.
[time=501] That's just a tremendous time to pause on Good Friday and to think about the death of Christ and the crucifixion and there will be music that's prepared and then we'll just bring a brief message to focus our thoughts on that.
[time=511] I'm excited about it.
[time=513] I really love this service and I want to remind you again, it's right here at the worship center of Blackhawk Baptist Church on Friday April 9th from 1215 to 1245.
[time=524] We realize that you, some of you might have a relatively short lunch hour so we've keeping the service brief but it'll be a time of inspiration for you and I hope you'll come.
[time=533] And then Russell Sunday morning, the resurrection of Jesus Christ on April 11th.
[time=537] I love the music because we can just think about the agony that Christ went through and then the victorious time and we're going to do two songs.
[time=545] One is called Behold the Man, just seeing him on the cross and then the fact that death couldn't swallow him up.
[time=551] He was the victor over death as he rose from the grave.
[time=555] There's something about an Easter service because everybody, so many times when people come to church they bring with them different feelings.
[time=561] On Easter everybody's thinking the same thought and that makes it a lot of fun.
[time=565] We're going to go back to the regular portion of our service now.
[time=568] I hope you'll stay tuned for the music and the message from our pastor Russell Moore.
[time=581] Oh Lord my God, when I hear someone do, consider all the worlds thy hands have made.
[time=598] I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder, thy power throughout, the universe displayed.
[time=611] Then sings my soul, my Savior proud to be, how great the world, how great the world, when
[time=631] sings my soul, my Savior proud to be.
[time=640] How great the world, how great the world, how great the world, how great the world.
[time=658] I walk at night beneath majestic skies and know behind it is a god of water.
[time=670] I rise, who thinks those stars each end their lonely place, and he wrapped them in a dark
[time=685] and grove of space.
[time=688] I span the heavens with a rapture in my soul, and wonder how a god made the whole.
[time=700] Could fix his thoughts to dwell on such as me, and give his son to tie upon the dream.
[time=715] Oh mighty God, how wonderful Thou art, to make the world and swan his fine and smart.
[time=729] I pray to come, bring her little son home.
[time=736] Oh mighty God, how wonderful Thou art.
[time=744] Oh mighty God, how wonderful Thou art, to make the world and swan his fine and smart.
[time=757] I pray to come, bring her little son home.
[time=770] Oh mighty God.
[time=792] If you have your Bibles, let me invite you to take them and open to Revelation chapter seven, Revelation chapter seven for our continuing study of this marvelous prophecy of what
[time=806] is to come, and I guess I should say I read there earlier in response to Keith's song out of Romans chapter six, in case you're interested, but Revelation chapter seven, and
[time=817] for most of us, we understand that the process of evangelism is slow going.
[time=825] I look back over the landscape of my evangelistic career, if you will, the times that I have shared Christ with people, both personally in the context of relationship as I've tried
[time=836] to cultivate it with them for that purpose, other times sharing the gospel really with someone I'd never met before, just handing out a track on the streets of New York or in Russia or in China or on a train somewhere in Korea, wherever I may have been handing
[time=850] out the gospel, or even corporately on such as an Easter Sunday morning where we preach
[time=856] the gospel in our entire intent was nothing other than to bring people to Christ.
[time=861] It's an easy decision to make or it's an easy assessment to make that most of the people with whom I have shared the gospel in my entire life have refused it.
[time=870] Most of the people reject the gospel, and you may look over the landscape of your life and find the same truth.
[time=876] It brings to mind verses that are for us in the Word of God that say, "While many are
[time=882] called, few are chosen," or the graphic picture that our Lord paints speaking about a gate
[time=889] and a road or a path, and broad or wide is the gate and broad is the path that leads
[time=897] to destruction, and many are they who find it, and small is the gate and narrow is the
[time=905] path that leads to life and few there are that find it.
[time=912] It's true that both in our own lives and really in church history, most of the people with
[time=918] whom the church shares the gospel whether corporately or privately rejected, but there
[time=924] are some points in history that we can look to where that has not been the case.
[time=927] In fact, where the opposite has been true, where great numbers of people have opened
[time=933] their heart to the gospel, and people have come to know Christ really in hoards.
[time=937] The first would be the very inauguration of the church itself at Pentecost, recorded for us in Acts chapter 2, you remember?
[time=943] The disciples were instructed to stay and wait for the coming of the Holy Spirit, and when he finally came evidenced by the wind and the fire, and Pentecost happened, and
[time=953] the church was born through the preaching of Peter, 3,000 people came to Christ.
[time=959] And then it goes on in the book of Acts to say they were being added to the church day by day, and their number finally comes to 5,000 people in a very short period of time,
[time=969] just a huge revival if you will, a great explosive evidence of the saving power of God.
[time=976] Throughout history it's been that way, there have been unique points.
[time=978] Jonathan Edwards was a preacher in the 1700s, the great awakening, and he was able to witness and see this kind of unusual moving of the Spirit of God to bring people to Christ.
[time=988] He reported that he saw in his own church in 5 consecutive Sundays, 30 people come forward
[time=994] to accept Christ every Sunday for 5 Sundays in a row, uncharacteristic for him, for his
[time=1000] ministry, for his church.
[time=1002] In fact it really impacted all of New England, not just his preaching, but this awakening of sorts.
[time=1008] The population of New England at this time was about 340,000 people, and in a very short period of time, some 30,000 of them made professions, genuine professions of faith in Christ.
[time=1021] In 1859, about 150 years later, in Wales there was reported 100,000 people coming to
[time=1029] Christ, short period of time, just this huge number of people.
[time=1033] In fact the newspaper there, the North Wales Guardian was trying to keep track and give a running total to the people who lived there about what was going on inside these churches.
[time=1043] After a week it said their total had risen all the way to 70,000 converts.
[time=1046] The next week it came back and said 74,000, so in the space of 7 days, 4,000 people had
[time=1052] come to Christ.
[time=1054] Huge outpouring of the Spirit of God.
[time=1058] In the earlier part of this century, from 1900 to 1910, Korea was a place that the Spirit
[time=1064] of God dumped salvation on those people, and some 80,000 Koreans came to Christ and joined
[time=1071] churches in a very short period of time.
[time=1074] In the 1930s, early 1930s missionaries went to Ethiopia.
[time=1078] When they arrived there, there were no converts.
[time=1080] There were no unsaved.
[time=1082] There was no church, just a bunch of unsaved people.
[time=1085] The missionaries labored for nine years, and at the end of their nine years they could show 48 decisions for Christ.
[time=1093] That really wouldn't be uncommon, that wouldn't be uncharacteristically slow, that's just kind of how it typically works.
[time=1100] Because of governmental pressure, these missionaries were forced out of the country.
[time=1103] They were allowed to return six years later.
[time=1106] When they came back, after six years, there were 100 churches and 10,000 believers.
[time=1111] In a six-year period of time, an enormous outpouring of the Spirit of God.
[time=1117] In the 1960s, and the 70s, and the 80s, while America was in its moral free fall, the Spirit
[time=1124] of God was doing an incredible thing in China, in missions, experts, estimate for us that
[time=1130] there are some 30 to 50 million believers have come to Christ in China in a very short
[time=1136] period of time, the underground church.
[time=1139] And I'm looking forward to, and with great anticipation, believing that what God is doing in Central Europe, in Russia, we will look back in our history books and we'll realize
[time=1150] that God has brought thousands, and I hope millions of people, to Christ, in a very short
[time=1156] period of time, in this dramatic opening of what formerly had been very closed countries to the gospel.
[time=1164] In these great revivals, if you will, in these great outpourings, and there are others, I just selectively picked these to give the feeling of what we're trying to talk about this morning, there are common denominators.
[time=1174] Number one, there is the sovereign work of God.
[time=1176] It's not the preaching, it's not the preacher, it's not the people.
[time=1179] It's not the church, it's not the circumstances themselves, God has worked in all different sorts of circumstances, through all different sorts of preachers, and churches when God decides to save a whole bunch of people in a short amount of time, He just does it through the power of the Spirit of God.
[time=1195] It's a sovereign work that He does.
[time=1198] It is always accompanied by a deep conviction of sin.
[time=1202] The people who are being saved in these revivals are overwhelmed with their own sense of personal
[time=1208] sinfulness, and crying out for the holiness of God, and seeking to submit their life to the will of God.
[time=1215] Thirdly, these times are characterized by great, great huddles of prayer and praise.
[time=1222] The churches in which these revivals start, and it starts in the church, and the people inside the church not only have a sense of their own sinfulness, those saved, but they give themselves the prayer and to praising God for His greatness, and though it's not a formula, and it cannot be done by command because first and foremost is an act of God, there is inevitably, in the hearts of the people, a tremendous sense of prayer and praise to God.
[time=1246] And what flows out of that then is just unusual effectiveness in evangelism, and great numbers
[time=1252] of people come to Christ in a short period of time.
[time=1257] Revelation chapter 7 is a revival.
[time=1261] In fact, it is the greatest revival in the history of the world.
[time=1266] What we see in this chapter is an international harvesting of souls that is unparalleled
[time=1273] in human history.
[time=1274] It's never happened before, and it will never happen again, because it is the end of human history.
[time=1279] In chapter 7, verse 4, you'll notice the first kind of statistics that are given about this great revival, and I heard the number of those who were sealed, 144,000 sealed from every
[time=1292] tribe of the sons of Israel.
[time=1295] Taken out of the nation of Israel are 144,000 people who come to Christ in a very short
[time=1302] period of time.
[time=1304] The second statistic we see in this passage is in verse 9, "Now not the Jews, but the Gentiles, after these things I looked and behold a great multitude which no one could
[time=1315] count from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues."
[time=1322] So it is the greatest revival in the history of the world for two reasons.
[time=1326] Number one, sheer numbers alone, sheer numbers alone, 144,000, and then this phrase the great
[time=1334] number which no one could count.
[time=1336] And I've told you before that the people who lived in this particular day, about 90 AD,
[time=1342] these folks didn't have computers or calculators.
[time=1344] The biggest number they had was about 10,000, and so when they really wanted to get big they said 10,000 times 10,000 or myriads of myriads innumerable.
[time=1353] This could be millions and millions and millions, maybe a billion people coming to Christ.
[time=1361] Huge numbers.
[time=1362] Secondly, it's the greatest revival in the history of the world because of its scope.
[time=1368] In years past when a revival would occur at some point an unusual outpouring of the Spirit of God would occur, it would happen in somewhat of a localized place, it would impact a nation or a continent or a people group.
[time=1380] But what you notice in verse 9 is this impacts the entire globe, every nation, all tribes
[time=1386] and peoples and tongues, unparalleled, unprecedented, unrivaled revival, right in the middle of
[time=1395] the greatest outpouring of the wrath of God in all of history.
[time=1400] They run simultaneously, right when Satan's fury is burning its hottest when demonic powers
[time=1406] are being released that have since been contained, when sin is running unchecked, the restrainer,
[time=1412] the Spirit of God and the church has been raptured, wickedness runs wild.
[time=1417] People are murderous, you remember the second seal, a brother is killing another brother, not just national war but individual strife and vengeance resulting in murder.
[time=1428] God adds to that famine and pestilence and the wild beasts are going crazy devouring human beings all over the earth.
[time=1435] The universe is being shaken, the stars are falling, the earth is shattering apart.
[time=1442] In this great time of God's wrath and as the wrath of God escalates, so does this commitment
[time=1448] and response to the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1451] It's right here in the tribulation that we find the greatest saving work of God in all of human history.
[time=1460] This saving work is divided into two parts, and I've hit it at it already, verses 1 through 8 describe God's work of salvation in the nation of Israel.
[time=1472] Just talking about Israel and then a second part of his saving work extends as I've also said in verse 9 to all the other nations of the world, verses 9 through 17.
[time=1482] And I just want us to look at this passage under those two divisions, the nation of Israel getting saved and the Gentiles being saved and then I'd like to make a few closing points of application about them.
[time=1495] Some of you who may be new to the Bible or to this church may have a question in your mind this morning, why in the world would God divide this great revival into two parts
[time=1505] or to two aspects?
[time=1507] What would make Israel unique?
[time=1509] What would make them worthy of special recognition to be set aside from all the other nations of the world?
[time=1516] And that's a very good question.
[time=1518] They deserve that.
[time=1519] They are different.
[time=1520] They are distinct.
[time=1521] And I'd like to help you with that.
[time=1522] If you hold your hand here in Revelation chapter 7 and come with me to Genesis chapter 12, and I'm going to do this very briefly, but I believe it's necessary to better understand why the division exists in the great revival at the end of the age, Genesis chapter 12.
[time=1541] What we have here is the beginning of the nation of Israel.
[time=1544] That's kind of interesting, isn't it?
[time=1545] I mean, the same nation that we can talk about and read about in the news, we could travel there, we could meet these people.
[time=1551] This very nation, some 4,000 years ago, began right here in this conversation between God
[time=1558] and a man by the name of Abram, Genesis chapter 12, verse 1 and following.
[time=1563] Now the Lord said to Abram, "Go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your father's house to the land which I will show you." In other words, I want you to leave Er, that's where Abram was living, and move across the Middle East to the place we know as the promised land where Israel is currently located.
[time=1579] They don't have all the land that God had originally given them, but they are at least in the land.
[time=1586] The end of verse 1, "To the land which I will show you," now verse 2, "and I will make you a great nation, the nation of Israel, and I will bless you and make your name great,
[time=1596] and so you shall be a blessing, and I will bless those who bless you, and the one who curses you, I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[time=1608] This is the beginning of the nation of Israel, and everything God wanted Israel to do is right encapsulated in these three verses, and it's very simple.
[time=1616] It's this, be my people, be my nation, live obediently before me, and I will bless you,
[time=1624] and what He meant by that, I will give you circumstantial blessing.
[time=1627] I will shower down upon you more sheep and more herds and more crops and more wealth
[time=1633] and more good weather and more favorable environmental factors, and you will grow, you will be the most unique nation blessing-wise of all the other nations in the world, if you'll obey me.
[time=1644] And when you hold that place of permanent blessing and you have all the wealth and everybody just sees obviously that you are the most blessed nation in all the world, they'll come to you, and they'll say, "Who is your God, who is your God?" And you at that point can say to them, "My God is the true and living God.
[time=1660] He is Yahweh.
[time=1661] Would you like to come into saving relationship with Him?" Because all of the other nations of the world then, as they are now, are worshiping false gods, and we could even include our own nation in that.
[time=1674] And so God's way of saving all the nations of the world was through this one nation, the nation of Israel, saying, "Live obediently before me, I will bless you circumstantially, I will make you unique, I will make you peculiar in the level of blessing that you enjoy, in your family, in your field, in your flock." So that when all the other nations of the world are forced to recognize that, they will then ask you the most important question, "Who is your God?" Some of you who are new this morning would be asking, "That's a great plan.
[time=1702] How did they do?
[time=1704] How did the nation of Israel do?
[time=1705] Were they successful in that?
[time=1707] Did they follow God?
[time=1708] Did they receive all those blessings?" And when they were asked, did they tell the other nations who the true and living God is?
[time=1715] Those of us who have been around a while and have studied the Bible can answer you very clearly, unequivocally, no.
[time=1721] They failed.
[time=1722] They refused to obey God.
[time=1724] They refused to follow Him.
[time=1725] And so instead of His blessings, He gave them curses to turn their heart back like a spanking would be given to a child for purposes of repentance.
[time=1734] And in those brief moments when they did receive the blessing of God, because one generation may have followed Him as they came to the apex of their influence, they built idols to false gods.
[time=1745] And when asked the question, "Who is your God?" They said, "Malik." They said, "Bale." They absolutely disgraced the purposes of God for their existence.
[time=1755] And so God put them on a shelf.
[time=1759] God sent His own son, the king coming to the nation of Israel saying, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand," and it says in the Bible that Christ came into His own and His own received Him not.
[time=1769] Christ came to the nation of Israel and Israel said, "Forget it.
[time=1772] We don't want you either." Even though you're working miracles, even though you're preaching as though you're God, even though you claim to be God and have all the proof of God and would be our Messiah, we don't want you.
[time=1780] And instead of accepting Him and following Him and beginning to reach all the other nations of the world through His leadership, they took Him and they crucified Him.
[time=1790] Two thousand years of stubborn rebellion, then the coming of the king Himself, and instead of repenting, then they crucified the king.
[time=1797] And so God said in the nation of Israel, "Israel, you're over here now.
[time=1801] You're over on this shelf.
[time=1802] I will reach the nations of the world through a different people, the church."
[time=1808] That's you and that's me.
[time=1809] That's why in the Great Commission in Matthew 28 before our Lord left, He said to you and He said to me, "And He said to this church and all the other evangelical churches in the world go ye into all the nations, baptizing them, and teaching them to observe all that
[time=1823] I commend you." So God has set this nation, this marvelous nation, the nation of Israel aside because of their rebellion.
[time=1835] But one of the marvelous things about our God is He keeps His promises.
[time=1840] And He had made some significant promises to the nation of Israel.
[time=1843] He said that I will bless you, He said that I will bring you into the millennium.
[time=1846] I will see you in the millennium and you will reign with me.
[time=1851] You will be used of me to reach all of these nations.
[time=1855] And even though they resisted for two thousand years and they have now been put on a shelf, these 144,000 that you are reading about in Revelation 7 is the beginning of God's
[time=1864] keeping of His promise.
[time=1868] Let me read to you the prophecy of Zechariah 12.
[time=1870] I can take you to a number of different ones in the Old Testament, but this one will suffice.
[time=1874] He said I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplication so that they will look on me whom they have pierced and they will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only son and they will weep bitterly over Him like the bitter weeping of a firstborn.
[time=1892] In other words there's coming a day when Israel will look at Christ and they'll weep over what they did to Him.
[time=1898] Have you ever witnessed to a Jew?
[time=1901] Do you realize that the Jew absolutely resents and hates any notion of the thought that Jesus
[time=1907] Christ born in Jerusalem so many years ago is the Messiah?
[time=1911] They refuse to read the New Testament.
[time=1913] They believe their Messiah is still yet to come.
[time=1916] They want nothing to do with the notion that Jesus of Nazareth is the Messiah.
[time=1921] So when you tell them that they tune you out, they shut you off.
[time=1925] Being a Jew to Christ happens also rare in the church age.
[time=1932] But a day is coming, says Zechariah, when I will pour out on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace in that need, an Old Testament passage talking about the spirit, not of the law, but spirit of grace and of supplication so that they will look on me Christ speaking whom they have pierced and they will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only son and they will weep bitterly.
[time=1956] Then Zechariah says in the next chapter verse 1, "In that day a fountain will be opened
[time=1962] for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for impurity.
[time=1968] A fountain of grace and forgiveness will pour down upon the nation of Israel and these folks will see Christ for who He is, weep over what they did to Him and their own sinfulness and come to Christ.
[time=1981] Come back with me now to Revelation if you would." Revelation chapter 7.
[time=1989] This 144,000 mentioned in verse 4 is just the beginning of God's keeping that promise.
[time=1996] It is a part of God's answer.
[time=1999] I believe that this 144,000 is saved somewhere in the beginning of the tribulation period.
[time=2005] And now through these seals, seals one through six, they have been faithfully moving in and around the nations of the world proclaiming the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2013] They have been doing what they had always been intended to do.
[time=2016] They are finally beyond themselves.
[time=2017] They are finally looking to please God and to win people to Christ.
[time=2023] But now at the end of the sixth seal, and if you were with us last week, you'll know that we finished our study of the sixth seal, chapter 6 verses 12 to 17, now we're ready to open up a whole new segment of judgment in the tribulation called the trumpets and the bowls, which is far more severe, far more intense, like nothing that we've seen yet
[time=2043] in the tribulation.
[time=2045] And before that occurs, before that judgment opens up, God says, "Wait a minute.
[time=2049] I want to seal these 144,000 Jews." You can read about it here in verse 1, chapter 7.
[time=2057] After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the
[time=2063] four winds of the earth so that no one should blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.
[time=2070] And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God, and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was granted to harm the earth and the sea, saying, "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads."
[time=2088] And I heard the number of those who were sealed 144,000 sealed from every tribe of the sons
[time=2094] of Israel.
[time=2095] In other words, these angels, four of them are holding back the winds at the four corners
[time=2104] of the earth.
[time=2105] And you can hear the skeptic saying, "See, the Bible really isn't inerrant." This was written when they thought the earth was flat.
[time=2113] There aren't four corners to the earth.
[time=2116] The earth is round and the very simple and obvious answer is we're not talking about the earth, we're talking about the wind and the wind has always been known to come from the four main points of the compass.
[time=2129] The wind comes from the north or it comes from the south or it comes from the southeast.
[time=2135] But here are these mighty awesome angels holding back the wrath of God symbolized as it comes
[time=2141] in on the winds of the earth, and they're about ready to let it go.
[time=2146] They're about to let chapter 8 unleash itself, which is all this incredible judgment upon
[time=2152] the earth.
[time=2154] But an angel comes down from heaven in verse 2, he rises from the sun, from the east.
[time=2159] The angel comes from the east, having the seal of the living God and he cries out with a loud voice, "Don't harm the earth until we seal the bonser."
[time=2172] And in this day and age, this sealing concept was obvious to everybody who would have read this, they would have sealed their private documents.
[time=2181] And for that you would have had a signet ring and if you've ever seen a great athlete who maybe has won a national championship at a college level or has begun a world champion athlete at the professional level, you'll notice a huge ring on their finger.
[time=2194] And raising up out of it is their team emblem, and some words are written there that describe when they won their championship and all these kinds of things, and the lettering is raised
[time=2204] up.
[time=2205] It would have been like that for a signet ring in this day so that when it could be pressed down upon some clay or some hot wax, the image on that ring would have been left.
[time=2214] It was not uncommon for unbelievers worshiping false deities to be tattooed with the signet
[time=2221] of their false God.
[time=2223] You would actually have that signet tattooed onto their body to show ownership and allegiance to this false God.
[time=2231] And of course, in the book of Revelation, large in our thinking, if you'll come with me to Revelation 13, you'll find there another seal this time called a mark, the mark of
[time=2242] the beast.
[time=2246] Chapter 13 verse 16, "And he causes all the small and the great and the rich and the poor." This is the Antichrist, "And the free man and the slave to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead." That locations, those locations only because they're easily revealed, take your glove off and show it, take your hat off and show it, not some place on your body in cold climates.
[time=2268] Verse 17, "And he provides that no one should be able to buy or sell except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the name of the number of his name." Verse 18, "Here is wisdom; let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for that number is that of a man and his number is 666 or 666."
[time=2289] Back to chapter 7.
[time=2291] So in this day, when in John's day exiled on the island of Patmos, where ancient deities
[time=2297] who had their own signet and those were tattooed to the body of individuals, the reader would have understood, and anticipating a day that is yet to come when the mark of the beast must be on the forehead or the hand, God is saying, "I will seal my own.
[time=2312] I will seal these 144,000 so that they can go now into the rest of the tribulation, where
[time=2318] the wrath of God escalates, where it's very difficult to live a day in this kind of wrath.
[time=2324] I will seal each and every one of them so that not one of them is hurt." For two reasons, one, I want them to continue on in their evangelistic effort till the end of the tribulation, and two, these Jews will be the beginning population of the millennium.
[time=2339] They will populate the beginning population along with saved Gentiles, and that's all you'll have in the millennium at the beginning, our believers, these 144,000 other Jews that may have been saved and lived, and other Gentiles that have been saved and lived.
[time=2354] So it's a great statement to the testimony and the faithfulness of our God, who some to this date, 4,000 years ago, promised to a guy by the name of Abraham that I will make you a great nation and I will use you to do a great thing.
[time=2369] We can look now at the Gentile revival, marvelous description of this.
[time=2374] They're in heaven now, verse 9, "After these things I looked and behold a great multitude
[time=2380] which no one could count from every nation in all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb clothed in white robes and palm branches were in
[time=2391] their hands, and they cry out with a loud voice saying, "Salvation to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb." They're in heaven because they've been martyred, they're coming out of the tribulation, they've either been martyred, put to death for their faith, or they've died in one of these plagues that the Lord has brought upon the earth for these Gentiles are not sealed as the 144,000
[time=2415] they're up in heaven, they're before the throne of God and they're singing praise and they're joined in verse 11, "All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God saying, "A men blessing and honor and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and power and might to be to our God forever and ever."
[time=2437] So now you see that these Gentile believers who are being saved in the tribulation, they
[time=2444] are coming to the throne of God and they are joined by the four living creatures, the elders representative of the redeemed church and they're all praising God.
[time=2455] You're saying to yourself, "Now how do these Gentiles get saved?
[time=2460] How does this great number from all over the earth come to Christ?" Well they come to Christ through four different vehicles.
[time=2466] This is amazing, the first, the 144,000.
[time=2470] The Jews are traveling through the world and they're preaching the gospel.
[time=2473] The second, they're coming to Christ just like we did from another believer, another Gentile who has prayed to receive Christ and is witnessing.
[time=2481] But the Lord goes beyond that, turn in your Bible to Revelation 11 and meet what we call the two witnesses, meet the two witnesses.
[time=2494] Beginning in verse 3, "I will grant authority to my two witnesses and they will prophesy
[time=2500] for twelve hundred and sixty days clothed in sackcloth." That's three and a half years, that's half the tribulation, we assume the second half of the tribulation.
[time=2510] These two witnesses will preach for the last half.
[time=2513] Now verse 4, "These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth and if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth
[time=2523] and devours their enemies and if anyone would desire to harm them in this manner, he must be killed.
[time=2528] They have the power to shut up the sky in order that the rain may not fall during the days of their prophesying and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire." These are powerful preachers.
[time=2545] You get in their way, they breathe on you, you burn up.
[time=2547] They want to prove their point, they shut the sky up.
[time=2550] They turn the water to blood, they bring plagues, convincing people, they're preaching the gospel, but look, it's even more convincing, verse 7, "And when they have finished their
[time=2560] testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them and overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt where also their Lord was crucified.
[time=2575] And those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in the tomb.
[time=2584] So this great beast comes up, he overcomes them, he slays them, their bodies are lying, they're dead in the street and thanks to CNN or some other way of communication that our
[time=2594] earth already knows of, everybody in the world will see the corpses lying in the streets
[time=2600] and they won't allow them to be removed.
[time=2602] They'll declare it dead witnesses day, verse 10, "And those who dwell in the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and they will sin gifts to one another." Oh hallelujah, the witnesses are dead.
[time=2614] This is the regenerate heart rejoicing because these two prophets tormented those who dwell
[time=2621] on the earth.
[time=2622] But look at what happens in verse 11, "And after the three and a half days the breath of life from God came into them and they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon those
[time=2633] who were beholding them and they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, 'Come up here and they went up into heaven in the cloud and their enemies beheld them.' God raises them from the dead on national TV.
[time=2646] What a replay that'll be.
[time=2649] Get that one on your VCR.
[time=2651] God'll do that.
[time=2653] That'll be part of the way that he witnesses to everybody.
[time=2655] That's where this great multitude of people come from out of every nation, tribe and tongue because these guys are preaching.
[time=2661] But in case they miss anybody, come with me to Revelation chapter 14 verse 6.
[time=2667] And now we're really heating up the evangelistic effort.
[time=2674] Revelation 14, 6, "And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel
[time=2680] to preach to those who live on the earth and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people.
[time=2687] And he said with a loud voice, 'Fear God and give him glory because the hour of his judgment
[time=2693] has come and worship him who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of waters." All of this, the 144,000 Jews, the Gentiles who get saved sharing their faith with other
[time=2708] people, the two witnesses who have the power to slay people in front of them and to bring curses on the earth and now this angelic being who supernaturally flies through the heavens
[time=2719] and yells with a loud voice to all the tribes, all the people, all the nations, this eternal gospel.
[time=2724] All of this happens because Jesus said in Matthew 24, 14, "And this gospel of the kingdom shall
[time=2730] be preached in the whole world for a witness to all the nations, and then the end shall
[time=2736] come." It's a great fulfillment of the prophecy of our Lord while still on the earth saying that you'll know the end is here because in the end of the age the gospel will be preached to all the ends of the world.
[time=2752] Back to Revelation 7 just for a minute.
[time=2753] Let me make some observations about what's going on here in heaven.
[time=2759] This great salvation is occurring.
[time=2762] They are in picture, they're in verse 9 with white robes at the end of verse 9 with white robes which talks about the imputed righteousness of Christ.
[time=2769] They're being given the very righteousness of Christ and they have palm branches in their hands reminiscent of the feast of tabernacles which was associated with the great deliverance
[time=2780] of the people from the land of Egypt.
[time=2782] They're saying God has delivered us and they have these palm branches and they're doing this thing in heaven and they're in their white robes and they're looking at Christ and they're saying salvation to our God who sits on the throne.
[time=2794] It's a beautiful picture of worship and adoration.
[time=2799] In verse 10 they sing their song salvation to our God who sits on the throne and then
[time=2807] the great throng joins them in verse 11.
[time=2810] Notice in verses 13 and 14 and one of the elders answered saying to me, "These who are
[time=2816] clothed in white robes, who are they?
[time=2820] And from where have they come?" This is just a punctuate, our understanding of this text, verse 14, "And I said to him, My Lord, you know," in other words John saying, "I don't know, you tell me.
[time=2830] And he said to me, 'These are the ones who come out of the tribulation and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.
[time=2838] I've never thought of blood as a detergent before.
[time=2842] Blood stains garments.
[time=2844] Blood is terrible on garments.
[time=2847] But when the garment is the soul of a human being and when sin is what is needing to be washed, it is the blood of the lamb which is the only detergent to clean and wash and make new and white." Verse 15 goes on, "For this reason, they are before the throne of God and they serve him day and night in his temple, they're no longer in the fifth seal, they're no longer beneath the altar, crying out for vengeance.
[time=2870] They moved out from underneath the altar, they've gathered around the throne and they are serving him." The Greek word here is not to do menial tasks, it's the service of a priest, La Truo, it's the worship word, it's the attending in the tabernacle of priestly worship.
[time=2886] And look at God's response at the end of verse 15, "He who sits on the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them," he's throwing a tarp or his tent over them, like a mother
[time=2897] hen gathers her little chicks together and throws her wings over them to protect them from the elements.
[time=2902] And that's exactly what he's doing, verse 16, "They shall hunger no more, they shall not thirst any more, neither shall the sun beep down on them nor any heat."
[time=2912] Remember now these folks have come through the tribulation or part of it anyway and they're hungry because they haven't taken the mark of the beast and they can't buy or sell, they're hungry because of the famine that they've seen, they're thirsty because the waters are being polluted and they can't buy drink either without the mark of the beast and the sun beats down on them and God brings them to heaven and throws his tent over them.
[time=2936] It says, "No more, no more hungry, no more thirsting, no more heat beating down on you."
[time=2943] Verse 17, "For the lamb in the center of the throne shall be their shepherd, he shall guide
[time=2949] them to the springs of the water of life, and God shall wipe away every tear from their
[time=2956] eye." It's a beautiful scene, isn't it?
[time=2960] The greatest revival in the history of the world will come simultaneously with the greatest expression of the wrath of God in all the world.
[time=2971] As we close this morning, let me make just a few points of application, draw this into our own lives.
[time=2978] Number one, the gospel and Christianity itself thrives under persecution.
[time=2993] It was true of the early church, it's been true throughout history, and it is true in this period of time.
[time=2999] It is when it costs the most to be a Christian.
[time=3002] For these people, it costs them everything.
[time=3004] Few of them will live through this.
[time=3007] To name the name of Christ in this period of history is the most courageous thing that anyone can do, and it is here out of this very climate that God is drawing the greatest
[time=3017] number of people to himself in all of history, and that's the way it is when the Spirit of God works in revival.
[time=3023] I was reading about the Welsh revival in 1859, and there were some who were skeptical about
[time=3030] these great numbers, a hundred thousand people coming to Christ.
[time=3035] One man wrote this to affirm the reality of their conversion.
[time=3039] Listen to this, "On every occasion, care is taken to instruct the people in the true and unchangeable principles of Christianity.
[time=3048] They are cautioned against resting in a mere outward profession.
[time=3052] They are told that excitement is not conversion, that an awakening of the conscience to a sense of guilt and danger does not always result in a change of heart.
[time=3063] It is strongly and constantly urged that whatever hope or confidence they may have in their own minds as to their having passed from death unto life.
[time=3073] It is a mistake, a delusion, unless it is accompanied by a hatred to sin and a renunciation of
[time=3080] it in every shape or form, love to holiness and the practical discharge of every moral
[time=3086] duty.
[time=3087] They are told that the Bible is to be the standard of religious feeling as it is of religious faith.
[time=3094] In short, they are admonished to seek a thorough change of heart and to furnish every evidence thereof in holiness of life." True salvation.
[time=3106] True salvation.
[time=3107] These saints are coming out of the tribulation when this kind of convicting faith, abhorrence
[time=3113] of their sin, a longing to see Christ and to have the holiness of Christ and a willingness to sacrifice their life for this newfound faith that was standard and norm.
[time=3125] It was then it was in 1859 in the true conversions of those who came to Christ and the wealth revival and it should be true today.
[time=3133] We are the ones who live in today where conversion to Christianity can almost be done as easily as changing a political party.
[time=3140] Where we are told by many pulpits in America today that to come to Christ doesn't involve deep contrition of sin, doesn't involve abhorrence of your own sinfulness and repentance and saying about and to the Word of God you are the absolute authoritative ruler and supreme director of
[time=3156] my life.
[time=3158] Whatever you say I do, regardless of what it does to my life or to my comfort zone or to my happiness, if that is not your experience, if it is not your experience to have come
[time=3170] to Christ over deep conviction of your own sinfulness and abiding fidelity to the Word of God, you may be a false believer and there is no climate or nation which will birth false
[time=3185] believers better than America today.
[time=3190] For many Christ as seen as someone that is added to the American dream, I have all that I have and then I add Christ and I hope that with Christ I'll have a little bit more.
[time=3202] In your salvation the gospel is hard, the gospel is demanding, the gospel is all encompassing
[time=3211] and during periods of ease it is watered down but in times such as the great tribulation it is seen crystal clear as demanding all of life, soul, body and mind but it still demands
[time=3223] the same today and we must work the harder to see it that way and respond to it that way.
[time=3229] Secondly, I'm looking at a period of time 7 years in length, some Jews are being saved,
[time=3235] some Jews are not being saved, some of the Jews that are being saved in fact 144, not
[time=3242] 142, not 143, not 145, an exact number of them are being sealed by the Holy Spirit.
[time=3252] I'm seeing a whole world of Gentiles and out of that some people are coming to Christ and
[time=3259] this passage refreshes my heart with the sovereignty of God.
[time=3266] God is orchestrating everything from the falling apart of the universe to the plagues, to the famine, to the war, to the preaching of the angel, to the preaching of the witnesses, to the preaching of the 144,000, to their very life and existence, I mean God is in absolute complete total control of the whole scene.
[time=3285] Nothing is happening there that He is not either doing or allowing and it says to rustle more, rustle more when you see things in your life that you don't like, be reminded that you serve a sovereign God and nothing passes into your life.
[time=3300] Nothing touches your life that doesn't first come through His loving sovereign hand and
[time=3306] the issue about those things in my life isn't how I can get rid of them or avoid them, the issue is how beings as they come from a sovereign God can I properly respond to them and bring
[time=3316] glory to His name through the trial.
[time=3320] We see a period of history in which God reveals His sovereignty to us in unique and marvelous ways.
[time=3325] And lastly this morning I just want to say this, don't stop evangelizing even though you and I happen to live in a revival less America.
[time=3335] We are not those who are living now in Russia and who are seeing people standing on the street corner hour after hour after hour, exchanging a month of their salary for one Bible.
[time=3344] You don't see that in Fort Wayne, I doubt we ever will.
[time=3349] It has not been our lot to live in the era and the place of great revival.
[time=3355] We live on the backside of a great work that God has done many years ago in this country, but evangelize just the same, evangelize just the same, don't be discouraged.
[time=3368] No one advance that most of the people you share with are going to reject the gospel.
[time=3372] We don't live in a revival hot area, but God still calls us to be faithful to our responsibility
[time=3378] to tell other people about Christ.
[time=3394] Well, it's been a privilege again to share with you the music from the Bible hour and the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore, especially thankful for Keith and
[time=3405] Starr Brodygum for administering to us in music.
[time=3409] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, or you have a special need, I want to take this moment before we close and just pray this prayer.
[time=3418] Dear Heavenly Father, I just want to take this moment and pray for people that really
[time=3424] have hurting and needs today.
[time=3428] Maybe they have marital difficulties or some emotional needs, some difficulties in their
[time=3434] job.
[time=3435] Maybe they're in need of a job and pray that you'll just be with those people and encourage them today.
[time=3442] And Lord, if there are those that don't know Christ as their Savior, pray that they'll pray this prayer today and realize that they need Jesus as their Savior to ask for forgiveness
[time=3452] and ask Jesus to come into their heart today.
[time=3455] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3459] If you prayed with us today and you need more information and what it means to become a Christian, let me ask you to write to us today and we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.

[time=3551] [SILENCE - 90 seconds]
