[time=9] Our society has de-emphasized the importance and the role of being a mother.
[time=14] We have denigrated motherhood.
[time=16] We have stripped it of its honor and its dignity and its purpose, and by and large today mothers
[time=23] are simply tolerated.
[time=25] They are viewed and typically portrayed as menial labor.
[time=31] It's remedial work.
[time=33] It's what you do if you can't do anything worthwhile with your life.
[time=39] And I call it an anti-mothering bias.
[time=42] I believe that our country and society is given over to an anti-mothering bias, which is under
[time=48] valuing motherhood and at times is even hostile towards a mother.
[time=65] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=71] Thank you for joining us.
[time=73] The state of motherhood in America is bleak, the long legacy of strong motherhood which for some 200 years has been the glue holding us together has fallen on hard times.
[time=84] What does the Bible say about mothers, and how can we strengthen and encourage them to be all that God created them to be?
[time=91] Stay with us, says Pastor Moore addresses this very timely issue from God's Word.
[time=96] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available.
[time=99] Pastor Moore will be leading us to several passages.
[time=104] Our special music today will be provided by the Handbell Choir and Read LaFavor.
[time=116] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=127] [MUSIC - 29 seconds]
[time=164] [MUSIC] Let me walk up in the ground after God's will overstrict us life [MUSIC] But when traveling days are over, not a shadow on the side [MUSIC] When we all get to heaven, when the day of rejoicing happily [MUSIC] When we all get to heaven, when the day of rejoicing and shout the victory [MUSIC]
[time=206] [MUSIC] Let us stand be true and faithful, trust in serving every day [MUSIC] Just one glimpse of healing glory [MUSIC] We'll have a choice of life prepared [MUSIC] When we all get to heaven, when the day of rejoicing happily [MUSIC] When we all get to heaven, when the day of rejoicing and shout the victory [MUSIC] Onward to the prize before us, to his beauty will be home [MUSIC] To the burning gates will open, we shall try to sit upon [MUSIC] When we all get to heaven, when the day of rejoicing happily [MUSIC] When we all get to heaven, when the day of rejoicing and shout the victory [MUSIC]

[time=484] â™ª
[time=497] Well good morning and thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour. I'm always excited when I'm either at the market or out at a golf course or wherever I happen to be in the community and people come up to me and say hey, I watched the Bible Hour and that's always an encouragement.
[time=513] And we're glad you're with us today. We've been offering a book called "L.A. Justice" by Bob Vernon. Bob's a good friend of mine. I made that friendship with him some years ago when I lived in Los Angeles. He's been the Assistant Police Chief of the Los Angeles Police Department.
[time=527] Been with a force for about 20 years and in fact was in charge when the Rodney King incident broke in Los Angeles. His book is a perspective about the L.A. riots that were associated with the Rodney King incident.
[time=541] And I've been refreshed as I've read it. Oftentimes I don't get the impression that the typical press is giving me the whole story and maybe you feel that way too.
[time=552] This has been a great opportunity to read from a dynamic Christian author, a man of God. He's been an elder at John MacArthur's Church there in Los Angeles for a number of years, a man we can respect and trust.
[time=563] Giving us his perspective on that very volatile issue. In the book you'll find all kinds of biblical principles and truth to live by.
[time=572] For those of you who work in the secular environment, this will be a great opportunity to see how a great man of God functions in very difficult times.
[time=579] So I want to encourage you to order the book "L.A. Justice" and we're asking a $15 donation and that'll cover the price of the book and even make a small donation to our ministry here in the Bible Hour.
[time=592] The other thing I want to say today was a little bit about our message on mothers today and you'll hear that in a minute.
[time=599] But it's a rather confrontive message and sometimes the word of God is confrontive and I hope you'll just open your heart and your mind and look with me in the word of God and reflect upon the truth of God.
[time=610] And if it does cause a little sting in your life, evaluate that and maybe that's healthy.
[time=617] Maybe there are some things that you want to talk to the Lord about in response to the message. But no, my heart is one of love and affirmation of all mothers.
[time=624] I think that mothers are the hardest working people in the whole world and I think they're the least thanked and appreciated in the whole world.
[time=631] And so though I may say some things today from God's word that are a little different than would be culturally acceptable, search the scriptures with me and examine them and allow the searchlight of God's truth to penetrate your life.
[time=645] And like I say, if there are some uncomfortable moments where I'll take those up with the Lord but be assured of my love for you and for your valiant efforts as a mother.
[time=656] Well, stay with us as we go back to the regular portion of our service.
[time=686] Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning our song shall rise to thee.
[time=704] Holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons blessed freely.
[time=725] Holy, holy, holy, holy, all the saints adore thee, casting down their golden crowns around the glass you see.
[time=740] Share of Him and to share of Him, falling down before Me, which word and heart can never bore shall be.
[time=754] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, though the darkness I adore.
[time=767] Though the eye of sin fallen, thy glory may not see, and only thou art holy.
[time=779] There is none beside me, perfect in power and in love and glory.
[time=791] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=804] All thy words shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[time=814] Holy, holy, holy, merciful and mighty, God in three persons blessed freely.
[time=830] Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy.
[time=845] (Applause)
[time=854] Amen. Thank you, Reed. Well done.
[time=857] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and turn to Proverbs, Proverbs chapter 15, as we get our thoughts collected on Mother's Day.
[time=870] And I guess I'll confess a certain ambivalence or caution as I come to this topic because I know that in a group this size, some of the women in this group have different and mixed bag of feelings about motherhood.
[time=885] Some of you have in days past a board of the child and you're grieved in your heart by that and every time a message like this is brought, it brings some of those memories up.
[time=896] Some of you are single and wish that you were now married and would have children and God has not given that to you and so a message like this can be hard.
[time=905] Others of you are married but can't bear children and obviously a message such as this is difficult. That may have been a lifelong dream, a passion of your heart that God has not granted.
[time=918] Some of you have been abused by your mother and have very painful memories of that whole experience.
[time=924] Some of you are single parent mothers and have to balance the demands of making a living and trying to provide for your family and at the same time be the kind of mother you want to be and you never seem able to do all of that and keep up with that and a message such as this one might make you feel worse.
[time=943] Others of you may have lost a child that you would very much love to be the mother of even today or have the privilege of mothering today and so a message like this can hurt.
[time=954] And I'm aware of those feelings and I'm aware of that different perspectives that we can bring to Mother's Day.
[time=961] And I don't want to rush off without first saying to you folks, my heart is with you and I trust that you'll understand that what we're trying to do this morning is talk to mothers and to encourage them according to the word of God.
[time=976] And so I pray you'll bear with us. I don't want to miss the opportunity to speak to the biblical perspective on motherhood. Not too many weeks ago I was up in a little bit more North in Indiana.
[time=989] Our Awana group from Black Hawk Baptist Church had been invited or actually we'd earned our way into a regional final in the Awana Olympics.
[time=997] And it was a long event, so there were hours upon hours to sit in the bleachers and share and talk with folks and I ended up speaking with one of the mothers in our church.
[time=1006] Delightful conversation I asked her how she was doing and she expressed that she was doing well and though it was tiresome and seemingly endless job of being a mother it was hard and would wear her out from time to time and I certainly have watched that happen to my wife and have a great sense of empathy for that.
[time=1022] But then she said something which took me a little bit off guard. She said I feel so unsupported as a mother. Just utterly unsupported and I, you know, queried to learn more about those feelings and she said well society really doesn't place a value on motherhood.
[time=1040] Then she said my own sister has elected not to be a mother but to pursue a career and I continually feel a sense of being downgraded by that as if I've opted for some lesser vocation in life.
[time=1054] And then she said my own mother kind of wonders what it's all about. I mean there's not a real sense of support and encouragement that she has chosen to be a full time mom, be a homemaker and really go after that as something worthy to give her life to.
[time=1070] And that began to ponder that and have ever since that conversation and I would tend to agree with her that motherhood is being de-emphasized in our day and age and by this society.
[time=1080] And that motherhood is denigrated. It's stripped of its honor in so many ways and the dignity and the purpose. Mothers today are almost just tolerated.
[time=1090] There's just a sense of tolerance. They're second class citizens. They're viewed and portrayed as being involved in menial labor, remedial work, stuff that you do if you can't do anything else.
[time=1100] I call it an anti-mothering bias where motherhood is being undervalued and motherhood is even experiencing hostility at times.
[time=1112] I guess it all began in the 60s and the 70s with the militant feminist movement. They argued that the job of caring for children was a form of oppression, slavery.
[time=1122] They even called it imprisonment. They compared the mental state of homemakers to the mental state of soldiers who had undergone severe mental duress in World War II.
[time=1134] In 1970, Jermaine Greer wrote the female eunuch, which condemned motherhood as a handicap and pregnancy as an illness.
[time=1143] Greer urged women to be "deliberately promiscuous" and to be certain not to conceive children broadening her attack against the whole institution of marriage.
[time=1153] She concluded, "If women are to affect a significant change in their condition, it seems obvious they must refuse to marry."
[time=1160] The classic critique on motherhood and family was Betty Frieden's "The Feminine Mystique."
[time=1167] Frieden described the family as an oppressive institution. She compared homemakers to "parasites" and said that the sexist ideas are "bearing millions of American women alive."
[time=1181] That's what motherhood is doing.
[time=1184] And though the militant feminist movement lost its political punch near the end of the 70s, and certainly at the beginning of the 80s, the anti-mothering bias runs strong in our culture today.
[time=1195] If you're not convinced of that, let me submit a few points of evidence. First, the television.
[time=1200] As you know, most of us have heard the statistics. Kids ages 6 to 18. In that amount of time, most kids watch about 16,000 hours of television.
[time=1211] To put that in perspective, they'll be in school during that same period of their life, only 13,000 hours.
[time=1217] What do they see? What do they learn? What are they told about motherhood in this powerful medium of the television?
[time=1224] Tom Shales, who is a TV critic for The Washington Post, said with the notable exceptions of the Cosby Show, Family Ties, and I don't know if you want to, but he did.
[time=1234] He kind of grouped Rosanna in that group. He said this, "Thematically, primetime is strictly Splitsville.
[time=1243] Families are the focus of the new weekly shows only if the families are broken ones.
[time=1249] Single parents, widows, widowers, and divorced husbands and wives have proliferated.
[time=1255] To a TV programmer, just about the only marriage that works is the marriage that doesn't work."
[time=1262] And even the most cursory review of programming today would bear the truth of that.
[time=1266] Programmers seem to strive to push into previously untapped or really off-limit areas of discussion like nudity and kinky sex and profanity.
[time=1278] But they self-sensor themselves when it comes to family and family values and anything that would resemble a biblical view of a home.
[time=1287] TV critic Jeff Greenfield says this of programmers, "They have moved into areas once considered untouchable in primetime,
[time=1295] yet the most common, most crucial area of all time, namely the capacity of modern men and women to love, trust, share, and provide a moral framework for children.
[time=1307] This seems to be beyond their grasp." He's right.
[time=1312] They're taking all their talent, all their money, all their ingenuity, all the power of television and perpetuating an anti-mother bias.
[time=1322] We could leave television and go to education.
[time=1325] Paul Vitz wrote a book called "Sensorship in Evidence of Bias" in our children's textbooks.
[time=1332] He examined ten sets of textbooks currently in use all over the country.
[time=1339] And he found there was hardly a story that celebrated motherhood or marriage as a positive goal or as a rich and meaningful way of life.
[time=1349] Motherhood was portrayed in two or three stories positively, but these were set in the past or involved in ethnic emphasis that distanced the mother from contemporary American life.
[time=1359] No story showed any woman or girl with a positive relationship to a baby or a young child.
[time=1368] And so those who are writing our children's curriculum are taking their scissors and they're cutting out a positive view of motherhood,
[time=1375] positive relationship to baby and young child, and pasting in its place the new family in homosexuality.
[time=1384] Adolf Hitler said this, "Let me control the textbooks and I will control Germany."
[time=1391] Abraham Lincoln said the philosophy of the classroom today will soon be the philosophy of the government tomorrow.
[time=1397] Those men on opposite sides of political spectrum both saw the importance of what goes into a young person's mind through the textbooks of schools.
[time=1408] So there's television, there's education, then we could just move to society at large.
[time=1412] It seems to be an interesting and rather intriguing contrast.
[time=1415] If you receive Time magazine you saw in the May edition a picture of Hillary.
[time=1419] And there in bold print is this title Ascent of a Woman.
[time=1426] This is really the elevation of womanhood now we're finding in Hillary.
[time=1429] And it's subtitled "The Most Powerful First Lady in History." So apparently power is what makes a woman a sin.
[time=1437] And we can contrast that to the hundreds of angry female students of Wellesley College in 1990.
[time=1444] They were protesting because Barbara Bush was going to be their commencement speaker and they wanted nothing of it.
[time=1450] They argued that Mrs. Bush wasn't a suitable role model for young women because she had spent her life raising children rather than pursuing a career for herself.
[time=1463] There are other new experts in the field of family today that are telling us an anthropology that are saying there is no such thing as a maternal instinct.
[time=1472] Professor Fields teaching anthropology at Colorado College says this to my knowledge there is no objective substantiation of a maternal instinct in the female human being.
[time=1483] The reasoning not only generates a mechanical fix it mentality but also implies something specifically vulnerable and dangerous about women in this society.
[time=1494] You see to have a maternal instinct by this anthropologist is to be considered dangerous and makes women vulnerable.
[time=1502] Well beyond the power of television and beyond the power of society at large and education there is this most powerful statement against motherhood.
[time=1516] It's more powerful than all the other ones combined.
[time=1519] It's when a mother has a child and leaves her child to be raised by someone else so that she can pursue whatever it is she feels she ought to pursue.
[time=1528] Nothing scars a life of a little one more than when deserted by his or her own mother.
[time=1534] When a mother says to her child in effect you're not the most important thing in my life.
[time=1538] It's my career, it's my qualifications, it's my education, it's my contributions to society that will define me, not the way in which I have raised you.
[time=1552] And in the more extreme cases youngsters are afflicted by crack cocaine addictions, maternal alcoholism, sexually transmitted disease, child molestation, physical abuse, abandonment and neglect.
[time=1565] It's a far cry from the legacy of motherhood that built this country and was bounded, founded on the word of God.
[time=1575] Who will take care of the mental, emotional, physical and spiritual development of the young people of this country if not the mother?
[time=1583] Theodore Roosevelt wrote this, "There are exceptional women, there are exceptional men who have other tasks to perform in addition to the task of motherhood and fatherhood, the task of providing for the home and of keeping it.
[time=1597] But it is the tasks connected with the home that are the fundamental tasks of humanity.
[time=1605] If the mother does not do her duty there will either be no next generation or a next generation that is worse than none at all.
[time=1615] God's design is motherhood, God's perfect design is for a father or a man to leave his mother and cleave to his wife and to become one flesh and in the purity and in the permanence of that unity, a young child is raised to be nurtured in the admonition of the Lord.
[time=1637] There is no substitute for that, it is essential, it is a part of God's design.
[time=1644] That is why God says in Proverbs 15-20, a wise son makes a father glad but a foolish man despises his mother.
[time=1661] Now I didn't really know what to make of that word despises as it is presented in the English so I dusted off the Hebrew and learned that it is a very simple word it means to undervalue something.
[time=1672] It was used of Esau when he undervalued, it says in the text he despised his birthright.
[time=1678] In other words he sold the double portion of his own inheritance and the privileged position of being the first born in the family for a bull porridge.
[time=1687] He grossly undervalued his birthright.
[time=1692] He was also used of Goliath who when standing out there on the plane of military battle saw this young little boy by the name of David, it says there in 1 Samuel that he despised the boy for his youth.
[time=1705] He grossly underestimated the capacity of this young boy, it cost him his life.
[time=1713] God says you are a fool if you undervalue the place of motherhood.
[time=1720] Proverbs 23-22, you might flip over there, Proverbs 23 verse 22 says it again.
[time=1727] Listen to your father who begot you and do not despise your mother when she is old.
[time=1735] Don't undervalue the contribution of your mother when you are old, when you are grown, when you no longer have need for her and maybe when she has need for you to provide for her.
[time=1746] Don't undervalue.
[time=1750] God is pretty serious about it, come with me to Proverbs 30 and look at verse 17 to describe the worthlessness of one who would undervalue motherhood, he gets graphic.
[time=1766] Proverbs 30 verse 17, the eye that mocks a father and scorns a mother, the word scorn there in the Hebrews, the same one as despised, it means to undervalue your mother.
[time=1777] The ravens of the valley will pick it out, pick what out, pick the eye out.
[time=1782] The young eagles will eat it.
[time=1784] This is graphic Hebrew language for saying if you are so foolish, if you are so worthless to undervalue motherhood, when your body is dead, nobody is going to bury you.
[time=1795] Your corpse will just lie there until the birds come and eat your body.
[time=1804] The design that God has, the perfect design for society and for humanity is inside the context of a family to have a father and a mother and a mother who would give herself to raising her children.
[time=1824] As her first priority, as the most important thing she does on planet earth, with no competing interests.
[time=1834] Well, I want to kind of designate all I've just said as my first point.
[time=1838] We'll call it the denigration of motherhood.
[time=1841] And we don't need to go any further, it's obvious, it's happening all around us, it happens even inside of Christian circles, and it is a problem, and God speaks very strongly against the denigration of motherhood.
[time=1852] But secondly, I want to speak to the deposit of motherhood.
[time=1856] And this is a slightly more positive point in its orientation.
[time=1860] Come with me to 2 Timothy chapter 1 for a minute.
[time=1866] 2 Timothy chapter 1 and verse 5.
[time=1871] You remember now, Timothy, he is about 40 or 50 years of age, he's a pastor at the First Baptist Church, I think, over an Ephesus.
[time=1880] And you know what, he's having some troubles.
[time=1884] He's got some guys inside of his church that are not living the truth, and they're not preaching the truth.
[time=1891] And they're making life very difficult for him.
[time=1895] And he's trying to stand against that invasion of worldly thinking into the church.
[time=1902] And some of these guys are older than he is, and some of them are smarter than he is, and more gifted than he is, and he has this little inkling to quit.
[time=1910] He wants out of the ministry.
[time=1912] We studied some of this when we went through the book of 1 Timothy.
[time=1915] But look at what Paul does in 1 Timothy 2 Timothy you see, he marshals his strength, he marshals arguments why Timothy should remain strong in the ministry and not give up.
[time=1926] One of the main themes in the book of 1st and 2 Timothy is because of the commitment and the faith and the dedication of his mother.
[time=1934] I mean you'd be laughed out of a secular society.
[time=1937] If you said to some president of Nabisco, hey don't quit, remember your mother.
[time=1941] You know, people would say what?
[time=1943] Don't quit because of your mother, don't quit because of the money, don't quit because of the stature, don't quit because of the prestige.
[time=1950] But look at this, 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 5.
[time=1953] "For I am mindful of the sincere faith within you which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am sure that it is in you as well."
[time=1966] Now how can he be so sure?
[time=1968] Well come over to chapter 3.
[time=1972] And begin in verse 13 you'll see again the description briefly of these evil men, but evil men and impostors they are a facade of Christianity.
[time=1981] They're not really even saved, but evil men and impostors will proceed from bad to worse deceiving and being deceived.
[time=1989] You see this is what he's got to stand against.
[time=1991] Look at verse 14.
[time=1992] "You however continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of knowing from whom you have learned them.
[time=2002] And that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
[time=2013] You see to a world that is devaluing motherhood, to a world that is saying hey that's remedial.
[time=2019] Oh yeah you do that, but you know maybe do that in addition to your career, make sure you do something with your life that matters, make sure you stand up and be counted in America today, have a career.
[time=2031] To that kind of argument I want to come back to the word of God and say here is a valiant warrior for the truth of God, Christianity in a sense, and this city is hanging in the balance.
[time=2043] And the champion of truth is being appealed to stay a champion for truth because of the tender loving care and commitment of his mother and his grandmother who went upon their knee he was given the sacred writings.
[time=2057] Boy that puts it in perspective doesn't it?
[time=2062] If you were to come into my office you would see a whole shelf that's just full of Bibles and different English versions and different languages and all that stuff.
[time=2074] And you'll find there at least two that mean more to me than any other, they are the ones given to me by my mother.
[time=2081] And my father, it was 1967, the third grade, I was going to go to Christian school and it was time for me to get a Bible and so they bought this black King James Version Bible, they wrote some nice things on the inside of it tucked it into my arm and sent me off to school.
[time=2097] And I learned all about the Old Testament stories and stuff like that in that Bible.
[time=2102] Well as often happens in life something happened to that Bible, my hamster got loose and he ate the cover of my Bible.
[time=2110] And so it was time for a new Bible and so when I was 14 years of age in 1972 for Christmas I got another Bible, it was a blue Bible, it was a Schofield reference Bible, King James type you know.
[time=2123] In it there was a Christmas card that came with it and I keep it there with my Bible.
[time=2127] It says this dear Russ, as you emerge into manhood it is our prayer that this gift may become your closest friend and that you may always seek its counsel as it has no human error.
[time=2139] Where parents or friends may falter, this will ever be truth.
[time=2146] Underline it, write in it, make it your friend, your very own.
[time=2152] Love mom and dad, but the handwriting is distinctly my mother's.
[time=2157] She was trying to hand me something that she knew would keep me the rest of my life.
[time=2166] When I was about 20, see I didn't even, even all that you can say shame on you Russell and I agree with all that Christian upbringing I didn't come to receive Christ until I was about 20.
[time=2177] Go to Christian school, get Bibles, have parents that love you, point you to the truth and I'm just blindly lost in my own sinfulness.
[time=2185] There came a point when I was a freshman in college, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo I was so sick and tired I was trying to just live my sinful life but I was so tired of all the stuff running around in my head.
[time=2195] About God and about Christ and about truth and about the Bible.
[time=2199] I said I got to do something about this I need a new way to think and so I signed up for a philosophy class.
[time=2207] And my intention was to just deposit all of my biblical upbringing at the front door of that classroom and have an open mind and get taught now a new way to think about the world and myself.
[time=2218] And I'm not the smartest kid in the class but as we read those philosophical arguments and as they were interpreted and explained to us by the professors they just had absolutely knew there was nothing they couldn't penetrate they could find no place to land inside my heart inside my mind inside my thinking.
[time=2235] Because there had been a deposit that had been made by my mother and my father in the way they lived their life and the books they gave me to read and the commitment of their heart.
[time=2246] And I eventually left that classroom picked up a book by C.S. Lewis called "Mirror Christianity" and came to Christ.
[time=2254] You see I was founded in the sacred writings since I was a little boy and it left no room to be corrupted by the lives of Satan.
[time=2265] And they gave me a third Bible when I was 21 and that's this one. So there is a continuing legacy of their commitment to the truth to hand to me the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through Christ.
[time=2279] But look again at this chapter verses 16 and 17 it goes further and I find this so intriguing verses 16 and 17 are like the pinnacle of biblical truth about the Bible.
[time=2292] When you go to seminary and you want to study the inerrancy of the Word of God you turn to this very passage and it is hand in hand.
[time=2299] It is linked forever in time with the sacred scriptures being given to Timothy as a child and then out of that following it comes this great statement about the Word of God itself.
[time=2311] As if to say that's where all children should learn about the inspired Word of God.
[time=2316] It says their all scripture is inspired by God that means it's God breathed that means it's not human words it's the living Word of God.
[time=2324] It's profitable for teaching reproof correction and training and righteousness.
[time=2330] Now I don't want to take too long with these words but there's something to be gained from them.
[time=2334] It's the Word of God that first of all teaches where is a young young boy or a young girl supposed to learn about honesty and virtue and character
[time=2344] and a work ethic if it's not in the Word of God.
[time=2348] Where will they look? Where will they go? How should a young man learn to treat a woman?
[time=2352] Well the proverbs are full of it.
[time=2356] How should a young woman learn to respond to the parental authority in her life and to be prepared for marriage and for a life of service to God through loving her husband and raising.
[time=2369] Where does all that come from? That comes from the Word of God. At the very beginning of life this God breathed book will teach the truth about life.
[time=2379] The word reproof means to refute error and rebuke sin.
[time=2384] When a mother has invested the truth of God's Word and made the deposit in the life and the soul of a young person then that young person as I've already illustrated carries that truth with them wherever they go.
[time=2395] And though they enter bad places where deceitful people would teach them or try to teach them error it's just confronted.
[time=2401] It's rebuked. It can't find lodging because the truth has found its way there first.
[time=2407] And where would a young person find the error of their way?
[time=2411] Where would the voice be that calls to it urine sin and that violates the Word of God?
[time=2417] In the last several years at the Masters College and we would see kids come from broken homes and from unsaved homes.
[time=2424] They'd come to Christ and then they'd come right to college and they would talk about their lives before they'd come to Christ and they were involved in all kinds of drugs and all kinds of sexual immorality.
[time=2435] And they would honestly look you in the face and they would say I had no idea.
[time=2440] I had no idea that it was wrong to have sex outside of marriage.
[time=2446] They had never been taught that. No one had ever told them that.
[time=2450] And from the bottom of their heart they would say to you with all earnestness I had absolutely no idea that it was wrong.
[time=2458] I felt no guilt.
[time=2460] That's a generation that's been raised without mothers and fathers who teach the Word of God.
[time=2467] They don't even have the right data to make life's choices.
[time=2472] It goes on to say not just teaching and reproof but correction and this is a wonderful word.
[time=2477] It means to set somebody back up on their feet.
[time=2480] They've been walking along and they've stumbled and they've fallen and the Word of God comes along and it sets them back up on their feet.
[time=2486] And so these mothers and grandmothers, Lois and Eunice were knowing in their heart that if we'll just put the living Word of God in the heart of little Timothy when he's older and he's trying to walk an obedient life before God and he falls down because of his own sin or because of the oppression of those who would persecute him.
[time=2504] It'll be the Word of God that's inside of him that'll pick him up, set him on his feet so he'll have endurance so he won't be a quitter so he'll finish the course in front of him.
[time=2515] And the word training there in the text is all about self-discipline.
[time=2519] It teaches self-discipline, instruction and righteousness that young people would have the virtue to hold themselves back from the alluring temptations of this world.
[time=2533] There would be a principle from within that says no and there is strength with it to resist the temptation.
[time=2539] What does it produce? Look at verse 17, that the man of God may be adequate and equipped for every good work.
[time=2548] The word equipped, it was a word describing the ships that would go out to rescue other ships and it was an equipped rescue ship and had everything it needed for the rescue operation.
[time=2559] It's a graphic picture of what a mother can do to give her child the inerrant Word of God and thereby equip him for all of life's challenges, struggles and trials.
[time=2572] He'll be lacking nothing. She'll be lacking nothing if nurtured in the Word of God.
[time=2580] Ronald Reagan said this, "If we fail to instruct our children in justice, religion and liberty, we will be condemning them to a world without virtue, a life and the twilight of a civilization where the great truths have been forgotten."
[time=2597] That's the day in which we live.
[time=2600] The great truths have been forgotten and the generation that is coming on to the scene today that is protesting in the streets of Washington that is demanding rights for gays and lesbians.
[time=2613] This is a generation that has failed to be given the deposit of the Word of God and they are adrift on a sea of immorality and they are to be pitied.
[time=2631] So there is this marvelous thing, the deposit that can be made.
[time=2640] Come with me to a last point this morning and that would be the dedication of motherhood, the denigration of motherhood, the deposit of motherhood, and lastly the denigration of motherhood.
[time=2649] First Thessalonians chapter 2, this is an equally remarkable text that marvelous things can be understood about the importance of motherhood from this text.
[time=2663] First Thessalonians chapter 2, Paul this time is on the defense, not Timothy, but Paul himself, the great apostle Paul, is being accused, his motives are being impugned, he's being attacked.
[time=2675] In verses 5 and 6 they are accusing him of having flattering speech, meaning that he's saying things that aren't really true, he's using his tongue to gain favor instead of speaking the truth in love.
[time=2688] And it also says in verse 5 they are accusing him of a pretext for greed that his ministry really isn't all about the gospel, his ministry is about gaining material wealth from them, and we know all about those kinds of charlatans in our own day.
[time=2701] And then verse 6 to seek the glory from men, as if the whole thing would add up for a self aggrandizing ministry to Paul, so they are accusing him of being full of flattery and speaking deceitfully and saying things that aren't true in order to gain their money and ultimately their approval.
[time=2717] Paul is now going to try to defend himself, he's going to try to say that's not what I'm about, as a minister of the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, as an apostle, you know what I'm not about that stuff, if you want to compare me to somebody, compare me to a mother.
[time=2738] He's the greatest point of appeal for his pure motives in motherhood, look at it, verses 8 and following, oh no, starting in verse 7, but we prove to be gentle among you as a nursing mother tenderly cares for her own children.
[time=2752] Now he goes on to draw out of that metaphor, the meaning, verse 8, "Having thus a fond affection for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become very dear to us."
[time=2769] He goes on, still the metaphor of motherhood, "For you recall, brother, in our labor and hardship, how working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you," we proclaim to you the gospel of God.
[time=2784] Man, I think that's fascinating. The guy that received more revelation than anybody else in the history of the world, the apostle Paul, when he wants to defend his motive in ministry, he appeals to motherhood and the virtues of motherhood and saying there, "I did not just give you the gospel I gave you my entire life," and that's what mothers do.
[time=2808] When a mother mothers, as the word of God calls her to mother, she gives up her entire life. She gives up her desire, she gives up her ambition, she gives up what she could be, she gives up all the potential that a society like ours would allow her to have, and she says, "My highest priority from my heart is to give my own life for my child."
[time=2836] A little letter here by an 11-year-old girl. Her name is Laura Parsons.
[time=2845] She says this, "I spent my summer the same way I spent my winter. I'm a mini-mom. When my mom is away at work, I take care of my younger brother and three sisters. A mini-mom's job is boring.
[time=2862] I take my brother and sisters to the bathroom when they don't want to go. I wash their faces while they jerk their heads away. I wipe their runny noses when they don't want to have them wiped.
[time=2872] I put them to bed when they're not sleepy. There's a lot of biting and spitting with the job.
[time=2881] I wish I had never been born first. I thought it would be neat, but that was before I found out that it would be the first to reach the top shelf and have to get glasses down.
[time=2894] The first to know how to button, tie, and zip, the first one to be old.
[time=2899] I wish I could be a sitter instead of a mini-mom. Sitters get neat snacks and tips if the house isn't wrecked.
[time=2906] Many moms get blamed if someone turns the garden hose on in the living room and punished if somebody eats the bananas that mom was saving.
[time=2916] We're treated just like mothers. Being a mother really grosses me out.
[time=2923] I hate the toilet procedures. I hate it when I call a thousand times and they pretend not to hear me.
[time=2929] I hate it, not having any time to be by myself. They like the real mom better than they like me.
[time=2937] I wanted to run away from home, but my mom would kill me if I went out onto the highway before they put the traffic light in.
[time=2943] Then she says this, "I don't want to be a mother ever."
[time=2950] And ends her letter.
[time=2954] Boy, a winner in light of how society has denigrated motherhood.
[time=2960] If we were to sample and survey the young ladies of Fort Wayne, both in the church and out of the church, ages 14 to 18, and said,
[time=2970] "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
[time=2976] Wonder just how many of them would put first top on the list. No defense. No apology. I want to be a mom.
[time=2985] I want to take all the talent and the brilliance and the resources that God has given me and I want to invest them in my kids.
[time=2997] I don't know what the percentage would be. I doubt it would be very high.
[time=3000] In fact, at the Masters College, I would ask, and maybe that's not a good sampling because it's women in college, but I would ask them what they want to do and why they came.
[time=3010] It's career and career and career and career, and I would say, "Yeah, that's great." Any thought of having kids? Oh, yeah. Some day. Some day.
[time=3023] I've seen some women stand up, young ladies like that in college stand up, and unabashedly say, "I want to be a mom.
[time=3029] Why are you here? Well, I want to get an education because I want to be a better mom." And I've heard other girls just scorn and look at that with contempt and say, "You want to be a mom?
[time=3042] Get a life. It's the 90s. What do you want to be a mom for?"
[time=3053] Don't turn here. Let me just read a couple verses from the Gospels. These are the words of our Lord describing the dynamics of spiritual truth.
[time=3062] And you think if you can find a better person that displays this truth than a mother, living out her godly motherly role.
[time=3068] Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone.
[time=3078] But if it dies, it bears much fruit. I can't think of anybody in society that lives that truth out more graphically than a mother.
[time=3088] Man, like a grain of wheat she falls into the earth and dies, almost dies at child birth, and then begins to give life through suckling the little one to her breast.
[time=3098] And then the real work begins as the arduous, endless hours of caring and nurturing and answering and solving and picking up and cleaning and all the rest of it comes.
[time=3109] But it bears much fruit. Another passage that was John 12, 24, another passage that I just think moms put on display in Technicolor, they live it out.
[time=3122] Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wishes to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[time=3130] For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life from his sake and the sake of the gospel shall save it.
[time=3136] For what is a prophet a man to gain the whole world but forfeit his own soul?
[time=3141] What is a prophet a woman to gain the accolades of society but to forfeit her own children?
[time=3149] Who takes up their cross more regularly and more faithfully and more consistently than a mom does for her kids?"
[time=3160] Well, I want to just conclude by letting you know what I said to that mom up at the Iwana event.
[time=3168] I said, "You know what? I don't think anybody in society works harder than mothers do." I believe that too, by the way. I don't know of anybody that works harder than a mom.
[time=3177] They're always on call, but never off call.
[time=3181] Secondly, I said to her, "And I don't know anybody in this society that gets less appreciation for what they do than moms, I agree with you."
[time=3190] And then I said to her, "But you want to know something? I think your job is the most important one on the planet."
[time=3197] If you were to give Pastor Moore a magic wand and I could wave it across the United States of America and whatever I wish for as I wave my magic wand would come true.
[time=3209] I'll tell you one thing. I wouldn't wish for the politicians in Washington to be different.
[time=3216] I wouldn't wave my wand and wish for the health plan of America to be different.
[time=3223] I wouldn't wave it and wish for a different economic status.
[time=3227] You know what I'd do? I'd wave my magic wand and I'd wish that all the mothers in America were like Eunice and Lois.
[time=3237] Women who had a deep, profound relationship with God that was founded on the Word of God who then dedicated their lives to passing that legacy on to the life of the next generation.
[time=3252] You know why I'd wish that? Because if I could do that and if that would happen, then all those other problems with time would disappear.
[time=3261] We'd have politicians who love God, who have seen in the life of their mother a self-sacrificing life and would have learned that life is to be lived for other people, not yourself.
[time=3271] We'd have politicians who are grounded in the Word of God who stand firm upon the truth. All the ails of society would eventually disappear.
[time=3282] And I said that to her and I hope she was encouraged.
[time=3287] James Dobson, who has said so much and done so much for mothers in America, says this.
[time=3291] Countless times each day a mother does what no one else can do quite as well.
[time=3296] She wipes away a tear, whispers a word of hope, eases a child's fear.
[time=3300] She teaches ministers loves and nurtures the next generation of citizens.
[time=3303] And she challenges and cajoles her kids to do their best and be the best.
[time=3308] But no editorials praise these accomplishments.
[time=3312] Where is the coverage of our mothers rightfully?
[time=3319] Newspaper headlines about the disaster of drugs, suicide and violence tell us loud and clear just how badly our young people need mothering.
[time=3327] But it is the business pages of our newspapers which make great fanfare over the fact that Ms. Jones is named the first female vice president of trendy cash and now.
[time=3337] That's the important news of the day.
[time=3340] There are no news stories telling us today a child was taught what it means to be loved and infant was hugged securely or that the wonders of a classic was introduced to a young mind.
[time=3349] No one seems to care that a house was made a home or that a simple table of food was transformed into a place of community and nurturing.
[time=3356] In the trench wars of Washington politicians discussed the issues grand and small.
[time=3362] Many posturing themselves as friends of the family but few of them understand how important the acts of love within the family really are.
[time=3370] Few understand what a terrible fate awaits a society in which no one has time to offer those open arms that comfort a child.
[time=3377] Even fewer take time to stand up and praise the noble and generally thankless tasks that America's mothers perform each day.
[time=3387] Oh put, it's true.
[time=3391] Most of the beautiful things in life come by twos and threes by dozens and hundreds.
[time=3396] Plenty of roses, plenty of stars, sunsets, rainbows, brothers and sisters, aunts and cousins.
[time=3403] But only one mother in the whole wide world.
[time=3409] Let's pray together.
[time=3412] Well that's exciting isn't it to open God's word and find a fresh and a new the biblical perspective on motherhood.
[time=3422] And you know whether you are a working mother or you're a stay at home mother Christ really makes the difference in a person's life.
[time=3429] If you've never prayed to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior let me invite you to bow your head with me and pray this prayer.
[time=3437] Father I know that I am a sinner, I know that I am in need of the forgiving grace of God that comes through Christ.
[time=3444] I accept Christ as my Savior and ask Him to be the Lord of my life to lead and direct me in all that I do and say.
[time=3452] I accept Christ as my Savior in the forgiveness and the eternal life that comes only in Him in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3460] If you prayed that prayer with me we'd love for you to write us and tell us the nature of your decision and we'll send you a little booklet called "Lessons on Assurance."
