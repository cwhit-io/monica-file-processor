[time=0] and so the obvious question begins to ask itself in our head. Why is God allowing this
[time=18] to happen to me? How can I continue to pray to a God who would allow that kind of thing
[time=25] to happen in my life?
[time=40] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Some of the most common questions asked by Christians when tragedy strikes in their lives are, "How can a loving God allow this to happen to me?" If God is really there and if He really loves me, why
[time=62] is He allowing this to happen? How can I continue to pray to a God who would allow this kind of thing to continue in my life? These are not only common questions but important ones also. Stay with us today as Pastor Moore seeks to help us answer these questions from our
[time=78] study of God's Word. We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available.
[time=83] Pastor Moore will be leading us to several passages. Our special music today will be provided by Becky Wollman and Reflection. Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=118] I trust the ever-living one, His words for me shall be, I need no other argument, I
[time=143] need no other plea. If it is enough that she's a star and that he died for me.
[time=162] My heart is ringing on the word, the written word of God, salvation by my Savior's name,
[time=182] I need no other argument, I need no other plea. If it is enough that she's a star and that he died
[time=204] for me, my great physician feels the same, the laws he came to say.
[time=231] My heart is ringing on the word of God, I need no other plea, I need no other plea.
[time=257] I need no other plea, it is enough that she's a star and that he died for me.
[time=286] I need no other plea, I need no other plea.
[time=316] My heart is ringing on the word of God, I need no other plea, I need no other plea.
[time=359] no other plea, I need no other plea, I need no other plea, I need no other plea, I need
[time=359] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 2146 seconds] no other plea, I need no other plea, I need no other plea, I need no other plea, I need...
[time=2533] plea, look at chapter 10, verse 1, I loathe my own life, but I will give full vent to
[time=2540] my complaint, I will speak in the bitterness of my own soul, I will say to God, do not
[time=2546] condemn me, let me know why thou dost contend with me, oh my lands, is it right for thee
[time=2555] indeed to oppress, to reject the labor of thy hands and to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked, this is a scathing indictment of God, he says I am full of bitterness,
[time=2567] I am full of anger, and I am going to vent it in this courtroom, and when I do I will see if you will contend with me, verse 3, is it right for you to oppress, talk about a loaded
[time=2579] question, who says he was oppressed, and who is he to question God whether what God does
[time=2586] is right or wrong, it's obvious if God is heavenly, if God is the heavenly Father that he can only do what is right, Job's pain and Job's sorrow and the duration of his trial
[time=2599] and the demandingness of his heart is bringing Job to say and think some things that are completely out of bounds, they're blasphemous, they're wicked, verse 15, if I am wicked
[time=2615] woe to me, in other words if I deserve all this stuff then I deserve it, curse me, that's what woe means, but look, and if I am righteous I dare not lift up my head, I am seated with
[time=2629] disgrace and conscience of my misery and should my head be lifted up thou would hunt me like
[time=2635] a lion, and again thou would show thy power against me, now he's accusing God of being an unreasoning bully, in other words we could show up in the courtroom you might not even listen to me, you're bigger and you're stronger than I am and you just beat me up, facts would have no persuasive power on you, you're not ready to listen to reason, you're not ready to be corrected, you're just a big bully and you would like a lion hunts its prey, hunt
[time=2660] me down, I'm helpless, again he indicts God as some type of horrible omnipotent cosmic
[time=2669] evil that is not right, will not listen to reason and if he is opposed he'll just kill
[time=2675] whoever opposes him. Come to chapter 13. Verse 3, "But I would speak to the Almighty and
[time=2695] I desire to argue with God," now down to verse 15 and most often misquoted verse, misapplied
[time=2704] verse, verse 15, chapter 13, "though he slay me, I will hope in him," and people usually stop there and say see what faith he had, we'll finish the verse, "Nevertheless I will argue my ways before him," in other words he is like a lion, he is bigger than I am, he is stronger than I am and if I argue my case he likely will slay me but I don't care,
[time=2724] I'd rather die trying to prove he's wrong than accept him the way he is, "though he slay
[time=2730] me, I will hope in him nevertheless, I will argue my ways before him." The anger, vengeance,
[time=2741] he questions the character of God, he questions the righteousness of God, the acts of God, the wisdom of God, now it all comes to a crescendo in Job chapter 23. Chapter 23 verses 1 and
[time=2766] following, then Job replied, "Even today my complaint is rebellion, his hand is heavy
[time=2773] despite my groaning," in other words he's insensitive, he doesn't care, "all that I knew
[time=2780] where I might find him, that I might come to his seat, I would present my case before
[time=2786] him and fill my mouth with arguments, I would learn the words which he would answer and
[time=2792] perceive what he would say to me, would he contend with me by the greatness of his power?"
[time=2798] No, surely he would pay attention to me, they're the upright, namely that's me, would reason
[time=2804] with him and I would be delivered forever from my judge. Job, Job, hang on to yourself
[time=2811] here pal, you're so messed up. He is actually saying if I could just find where I could get
[time=2818] into his presence I know I could begin to listen to him and argue with him and I'd become
[time=2824] very persuasive and eventually I'd be able to argue my case with such convincing power that it would put off his own ability to kill me, he'd pay attention to me, verse 7,
[time=2835] the upright, that's me, I'd reason with him and I'd finally be delivered from him who is my judge. Ah, that would be my day in court. Weird things happen to people when God allows
[time=2854] their comfort zone to be violated for a long period of time and he gives them no answers and he gives them no help as far as their circumstances and though he begins this book
[time=2865] as being described, blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil, all God has to do is knock the props out from underneath his life as Satan accused, all he has to do is rip the thin veneer of his Christianity off and Job never cursed God but he sure
[time=2880] got in his face and he sure questioned his integrity and his character and all that God stood for and he accused God of doing things that were wrong. Well, as you've noticed God
[time=2895] hasn't been saying much but he's going to speak here now. Come to Job chapter 38, chapter
[time=2910] 38 verse 1, then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, could have been translated
[time=2919] storm. You know you're in trouble when God's going to answer and he answers out of a storm.
[time=2926] I mean that's like punctuating his feelings. Here it comes, what does he say? Verse 2,
[time=2933] who is this that darkens counsel? By words without knowledge. Now gird up your loins
[time=2942] like a man and I will ask you and you instruct me. Now here it is laced with sarcasm. Listen
[time=2949] to these questions, envision yourself standing before God demanding a presence with him, demanding to plead your case because you find him unrighteous and that he has done you wrong. Answer his questions, will you? Verse 4, where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me if you have understanding, who said it's measurement since you know,
[time=2970] or who's scattered, or excuse me, stretched the line on it? On what were its bases sunk
[time=2977] or who laid its cornerstone when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shout out for go. That's a picture of the creation of the heavens and the earth and the angels there described as the sons of God are shouting with joy at the magnificent wisdom and power of God who can create this whole thing out of nothing. He says to Joe, where were you? Verse 8, who enclosed the sea with doors? When bursting forth it went out from
[time=3002] the womb, who said to it in verse 11, "Thus far you shall come, but no farther, and here
[time=3009] shall your proud waves stop." Are you okay with this? Can you do this too? Can you say
[time=3016] to the waves? Stop right here. Can you move the Pacific Ocean 150 miles that way? Or are
[time=3024] you pretty much just a pawn at the hands and the power of the proud waves of the ocean?
[time=3031] Verse 12, "Have you ever in your life commanded the morning and caused the dawn to know its place?" What was the last time, Joe? You just kind of wanted it to be day time. So in the middle of the night you said, "Dawn," and the sun came up. He goes on. Verse 16, "Have
[time=3052] you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?
[time=3056] Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of deep darkness?"
[time=3063] Verse 19, "Where is the way to the dwelling of light?" That's a question. And darkness,
[time=3069] where is its place that you may take it to its territory, that you may discern the paths to its home? Yeah, we handle light. We flick a switch. It comes on. We flick a switch. It goes off. What God is saying, "Joe, just grab a little bit of light. Just hold it in your arms and take it somewhere. Put it in its home and tell it to stay there until you come back for it. Do the same with darkness." And you know, this is amazing. And Joe can't
[time=3094] begin to answer these questions, but this is just absolutely mundane compared to the questions God could have asked, Joe, about an atom or about a molecule that we now have
[time=3105] a little more understanding into. I mean, this is just basic stuff. Verse 34, "Can you
[time=3112] lift up your voice to the clouds so that an abundance of water may cover you? Can you send forth lightnings that they may go and say, 'Here we are. Can you command and have lightning appear in the sky? Can you command and have it disappear? Who are you, Job? Where do you come from? Who are you to sit in judgment of me?" Well, listen to Job's answer in chapter
[time=3134] 40. Chapter 40, verse 1, "Then the Lord said to Job, 'Will the fault finder contend with
[time=3144] the Almighty? Let him reproves God, answer it.'" In other words, who do you think you are?
[time=3154] Then verse 3, "Joe answered the Lord and said, 'Behold, I am insignificant. What can I reply
[time=3161] to you? I lay my hand on my mouth. It's like when you've said something that you wish
[time=3167] you hadn't said, you go, when you're trying to grasp the words back, but you can't, you stop speaking." Verse 5, "Once I have spoken, I will not answer. Even twice I will add no more." Job thinks it's enough that he just shut up, that he's saying, "I'm insignificant.
[time=3185] I stop." But the loving hand of God is not finished in Job's life. It's over 6. "Then
[time=3195] the Lord answered Job out of the storm and said, 'Now gird up your loins like a man.
[time=3201] I will ask you and you instruct me. Will you really know my judgment? And will you condemn
[time=3208] me that you may be justified.'" There it is, folks. "There is the pattern of the believer
[time=3219] who when they do not like the way God's sovereign loving hand is leading them into the loss of a husband, the loss of a wife, the loss of a job, the loss of a reputation, the loss of whatever it is. And when the severe circumstances are so hard and they toil so long on the mere
[time=3237] human frame, eventually the human heart will strike out at God and it will try to annul
[time=3243] his judgment and condemn him that that same human heart will be justified." God, you have
[time=3251] made a mistake. You are wrong. I am right. If you would just listen, you'd learn that
[time=3257] from me. Will you really know my judgment? Will you condemn me that you may be justified?
[time=3272] And Job is going to talk one more time in this book. Come to chapter 42. Then Job answered
[time=3284] the Lord and said, "I know that thou canst do all things and that no purpose of thine
[time=3291] can be thwarted." Here we are back to the sovereignty of God. "I am fully aware that you are totally sovereign." Verse 3, "Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?
[time=3304] Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand things too wonderful for me,
[time=3310] which I did not know. As your finite creature, I have no ability to comprehend, understand
[time=3318] you in totality and therefore I have no position to sit in judgment of your behavior and what
[time=3325] you are doing in my life." Verse 4, "Here now, and I will speak, I will ask thee and do
[time=3331] thou instruct me? There is a humble, teachable heart." Verse 5, "I have heard of thee by the
[time=3338] hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees thee. Therefore I retract and I repent in dust and
[time=3347] ashes." Verse 5 is the most blessed verse in the whole book. You know what's going on here? Verse 5, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear." He was blameless. He was upright. He was turning away from evil. Why? Because he had been taught about God.
[time=3360] He had heard about God. He had learned certain things about God. But God loves him so much
[time=3368] that he see his own sinfulness and that he enter into a deeper, more intimate relationship with him that he allows Satan to destroy the externals of his life so he can come to the place of saying, "I used to hear of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you." You have acted personally and intimately in my life. You have put your finger on direct
[time=3389] problems in my life to show me how conditional I am with you that if you give me what I want, I love you. If you don't, I blame you. Here we have a picture of a loving, intimate
[time=3401] God that refuses to allow Jerb's knowledge to be secondhand. Therefore I retract and
[time=3412] I repent in dust. That's a happy place.
[time=3427] I hope you enjoyed the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir, the Reflection and Soloist
