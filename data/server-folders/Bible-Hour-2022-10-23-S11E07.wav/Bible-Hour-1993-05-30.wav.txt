[time=0] But Jesus in Matthew 24 verse 4 says this, Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it
[time=22] that no one mislead you, for many will come in my name saying I am the Christ and will
[time=29] mislead many."
[time=45] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Satan has long been called the deceiver.
[time=57] He has worked through the ages to bring people to believe his lies about God and about the word of God.
[time=63] Today in our study of Revelation, we will see his final effort to deceive the world, and the devastating effect it will have on those who accept his lies as truth.
[time=74] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available.
[time=77] Pastor Moore will be speaking from the book of Revelations, chapters 12, 13, and 14.
[time=86] Our special music today will be provided by Michelle Smeckins.
[time=93] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=98] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, early in the morning our song shall rise to be.
[time=110] Holy, Holy, Holy, merciful, and mighty, God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[time=121] Holy, Holy, Holy, all the saints adore thee, casting down their golden crowns around the
[time=131] sea, cherubim and seraphim, falling down before thee, who were in an art, and evermore shall
[time=141] be.
[time=142] Holy, Holy, Holy, felt the darkness tightly, felt the eye of a sinful man, by glory may

[time=203] As God walked with his creation, man began to know his master.
[time=208] This was a God so mysterious that he moved among worlds beyond our knowing, so mighty that he spoke with thunder, so gentle that he breathed the evening breeze, so wise that
[time=220] he understood tomorrow, so wonderful that he walked and talked with man.
[time=227] In those first cool evenings in the garden, God opened his heart to his creation, and the man came to know him by one word, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,

[time=436] [MUSIC - 45 seconds]
[time=493] (audience applauds) - Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=500] We're so encouraged when we hear from you and through letters and even telephone calls to the church letting us know that you faithfully watch the Bible Hour.
[time=509] You know, last summer I came across some Bible character cards and I thought, you know, this might just be a great way to spend some time with your children or grandchildren.
[time=519] So I thought if you didn't take advantage of the opportunity to get the Bible character cards, we'd offer them again this summer.
[time=526] They're a set of 72 cards, each one having a picture of one of the Bible characters, a little bit of their biography, and it's an excellent way to share the different characters that are listed in our Bible and a little bit about their lives and how they represented the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=545] So you can receive these character cards by writing to the Bible Hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=557] If you have the opportunity to write and consent us a donation, we'd appreciate it, but we'll send the cards to you free if you'll just write to us and ask for the Bible character cards.
[time=568] It's a great way to spend a summer with your grandchildren if they come to visit you.
[time=573] We have a special event coming up.
[time=575] Russell, this is the 20th year for the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=578] It's hard to believe that, but we have been singing songs about God and country for a number of years now.
[time=586] And you know, we are so blessed to have something to sing about.
[time=589] I know that we come to appreciate that even more in the last many years as the former Soviet Union has finally given up on communism and to think that through the centuries we have enjoyed freedom in this country, freedom to pursue our beliefs and in our case the cause of Christ.
[time=606] [AMEN] That special event we're calling it "Reflections on America from Sea to Shining Sea" and we'll be having that program on Sunday afternoon, June 27th at 4 p.m.
[time=619] That's an excellent time for you to come and visit Blackhawk Baptist Church if you're not a regular attender and join with us on that special tribute to America and in particular those who have faithfully fought for the preservation of the United States of America.
[time=634] We're so excited about the program.
[time=636] We want to take just a little bit of time on our insert here to show you some of the programs of the past and give you a little bit of an idea of the music, the video, and the atmosphere that's created during our annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=651] [MUSIC - 107 seconds]
[time=763] Well, I hope that gives you some excitement for our Patriotic Panorama.
[time=768] Once again, that'll be Sunday afternoon, June 27th at 4 p.m.
[time=773] right here at the Blackhawk Baptist Church, 7,400 East State Boulevard in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=779] I hope you'll come and join with us.
[time=781] We're going back to the live portion of our service now.
[time=784] Stay tuned for more music and the message from our Pastor Teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=789] [MUSIC - 308 seconds]
[time=1102] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1107] Thank you, Michelle, and how thankful we are that that rock is none other than the person of the living Lord Jesus Christ. Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come to Revelation chapter 12. If you're new here with us for the first time this morning or visiting, we're in the book of Revelation. And I want to begin this morning by reading Revelation chapter 12 verse 9. It says there, the great dragon was thrown in the heart of Jesus Christ.
[time=1136] The great dragon was thrown down, the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him. Through the ages, Satan has been called the deceiver. In fact, since his first act of deception in the Garden of Eden, he has been referred to as the deceiver, the serpent, the devil.
[time=1165] And from time to time, we have opportunity to run into people that he has successfully deceived. In fact, it's more often than not if you're involved in talking with people about the gospel.
[time=1175] Remember, not too many years ago, flying from one part southern California to northern California, I was going to speak somewhere and oftentimes you feel as though there are divine appointments just by the way that you're seated on the aircraft. And I ended up next to a young man who began to find things in common with, and we both had motorcycles in common.
[time=1194] And I had a number of different motorcycles as I was growing up. He had motorcycles through most of his life, and we also had another thing in common. We've both been to motorcycle accidents, which may be a common denominator among most motorcycle owners.
[time=1209] Mine was somewhat minor in that I'd only broken the bones in my right foot. His was life-threatening. In fact, he went on to tell me the story of how really he should have died at several different points throughout this whole extravagant experience.
[time=1223] And I listened with great interest, and it just seemed to me when we were done listening that it was obvious that God had kept this guy alive for something special because there was no other way to explain it.
[time=1234] And so I said that to him. I said, "It seems like God has kept you alive for something special."
[time=1241] And I was going to then kind of segue from there right into the gospel. I mean, what could be more special than coming to know Christ as your personal Lord and Savior?
[time=1249] But he kind of cut me short and said, "God, you believe in God?" I said, "Yeah, don't you?" And he said, "Absolutely not. I don't believe in God."
[time=1261] I said, "Well, what about the heavens on the earth thinking of Romans chapter 1 and how they proclaim the glories of God?"
[time=1269] And he said, "I don't believe in creation. I believe in evolution." And then he went on for a long, long time about why he believed in evolution.
[time=1276] You come to a point in a conversation like that where you can offer the truth and you can be as clear and friendly as you can, but the deception is so complete and so thorough that the mind is shut and the gospel finds no foothold there.
[time=1291] And oftentimes, that's the way it is with people in the world. I remember evangelizing with someone, and this is not an uncommon experience.
[time=1298] You have probably had one very similar to it, but going through the ED presentation and getting through some of the important elements of it and finally coming to the notion that the wages of sin is death.
[time=1308] And death means not just physical death, but spiritual death and separation from God and hell and burning forever and ever in constant torment and being stopped right there by the person with whom I was sharing the gospel.
[time=1321] And they said, "No, I believe in God and I believe in Christ, but I don't believe in hell. I don't believe there's any possible way that God would send people to hell forever and ever and ever."
[time=1331] And you learn what they mean by God and what they mean by Christ is something entirely different than the Bible. They just have kind of warm, fuzzy feelings about some eternal spirit, but the notion that people would burn forever and hell impossible.
[time=1345] In fact, they think that a God like that doesn't deserve to be God. And so they are completely deceived. And again, the gospel stops right there.
[time=1353] And there is no hope of salvation for that person at that point because they are so completely deceived by these misunderstandings, these have truths, these falsehoods about God and about Christ and about the Word of God.
[time=1368] Webster's defined deception as to cause, to accept as true, what is false. To accept as true, what is false.
[time=1377] And as I speak with people who are deceived and don't come to the true knowledge of Christ, I find oftentimes it's a sincere deception.
[time=1385] They really believe it in their heart. They're not just kind of buying on to something so that they can justify their sinful behavior.
[time=1391] If you say, "Tell me about God," they'll tell you exactly what they really believe about Him. It's wrong. It's completely different than the Word of God. It's a damning belief about God, but they're sincere in it.
[time=1401] They really believe it with all their heart. And these are the people who have been effectively deceived by Satan himself or the prince of the power of the heir and his satanic system.
[time=1414] In fact, and you can stay in Revelation for a minute, but the other major passage in the New Testament about the end times is the Olivet Discourse. You know that it's Matthew 24.
[time=1424] And Jesus says, "One of the hallmarks of the end of the age will be this incredibly deceptive and deceiving spirit."
[time=1431] Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one misleads you." It's the same Greek word for deceive that we have in Revelation 12 verse 9.
[time=1439] "See to it that no one deceives you, for many will come in my name saying I am the Christ and will mislead or deceive many."
[time=1448] So the end of the age is marked by this massive, massive commitment to deception. It goes on there in Matthew 24 to talk about the extent of the deception.
[time=1462] Speaking about many false prophets will arise and deceive many. In fact, they're so effective for false Christ and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to mislead, if possible, even the elect.
[time=1477] Meaning even the Christians that are alive at that time. An enormous commitment and entourage of deceit will impact the earth at the end of the age.
[time=1490] And so I want us to look at that. Why does it happen like that? How does it occur?
[time=1494] And to do that we're going to really look at chapters 12, 13 and 14. It's a broad perspective of deceit.
[time=1502] And as I read it over and over again in my study this week that seemed to be the theme was, and I break it into four different parts.
[time=1509] Number one, the deceiver, and we'll look at him and why his efforts come at this point in time in specific and special emphasis in deception.
[time=1519] Two, the deceivers, deceivers. In other words, who he's using to help him in his deceptive efforts.
[time=1527] Thirdly, the deceived, those who fall prey to it and the consequences that come to them. And then lastly, the undeceaved.
[time=1535] And so I hope that'll help you track where we're going to head. We're going to go into some chapters by the way in the book of Revelation that are repetitive in nature.
[time=1542] They're somewhat cyclical. Much of what is categorized here or catalog for us has already been spoken of or will be spoken of again.
[time=1549] The symbolism of this book really escalates in these chapters and so it's difficult to give complete and thorough examination and comment and definitive answers to a lot of it.
[time=1562] For example, come to Revelation chapter 13 for a minute. You'll see there talking about the antichrist.
[time=1569] And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea having ten horns and seven heads and on his horns were ten diodems and on his heads were blasphemous names.
[time=1577] And the beast which I saw was like a leopard and his feet were like those of a bear and his mouth like that of a lion and the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.
[time=1586] And through the ages, Bible teachers have tried to become in my opinion too specific with that.
[time=1591] I believe that's talking about his political, national, worldwide authority. He's going to be an awesome ruler who will lead and reign like no other government has ever reigned.
[time=1601] But people sometimes have gone too far with that and tried to define that too specifically and I'll avoid doing that.
[time=1607] It's a little bit like the story that's told by a little boy named Danny who every morning he woke up on Sunday, he had a thousand different reasons why they shouldn't be going to church.
[time=1617] And so he tried to use that on his parents. It's too sunny, it's too cold, it's too windy, it's this, it's that, it's that.
[time=1622] But they were good parents and they prevailed upon little Danny and got him into Sunday school.
[time=1627] In particular Sunday he came out with kind of an enlightened face. He was really energetic and excited about all that was going on and they were curious because that was rare for him to come out of Sunday school looking that positive.
[time=1638] I said Danny what happened in Sunday school? And Danny said oh incredible story you know about Moses and the Jews and the Egyptians and how the Jews wanted to get out of Egypt and the Egyptians didn't want them to but the Jews left anyway.
[time=1653] And so they loaded up in their trucks and all their stuff and they drove out of Egypt but the Egyptians didn't want to believe and so they attacked them with their tanks and all their military stuff.
[time=1663] And it got really bad he said to his dad and so Moses got on his walkie-talkie and he called in an air strike and the air strike was relatively effective.
[time=1671] It held the Egyptians up for a little while but then they caught up again and the Jews weren't right there on the edge of this ocean or something and they couldn't get over the water.
[time=1680] It was like a sea and they were going to die there. And Moses got on the walkie-talkie again and he called up the navy seals and they built a pontoon bridge right across there and the Jews went across and his dad said,
[time=1692] Danny did they really? Is that really what they taught you? He said no dad but if I told you what they told me you'd never believe it.
[time=1705] And sometimes you know the Bible can't take you places where you don't really understand and I think that that happens and especially it happens in some of these chapters in 12, 13 and 14 and so I'm not going to try to push too hard to try to define too many details.
[time=1721] And I find some encouragement for that over in the book of 1 Peter. You remember the Old Testament prophets? They would look into the prophecies of Christ and not know how to understand or interpret them.
[time=1731] In fact they got stuck. It says in 1 Peter 1, 11, seeking to know the person or the time of Christ because it indicated he would be suffering and also be glorified.
[time=1743] And as they would read their Old Testament they'd see the suffering lamb who would be slain for the sins of the world and in other parts of their Old Testament they'd see this reigning conquering king who would be victorious all of all the world powers and they didn't know how to bring that into the same guy.
[time=1758] And they couldn't. They were confused and they left confused. They died confused. They finally understood that it wasn't for them. It was going to be for somebody else.
[time=1765] Of course they forgot or they didn't know. Actually didn't forget. They just didn't know one critical thing about Christ. He has not just one coming but two comings.
[time=1773] And as soon as you know that in the first coming he suffers and in the second coming he conquers.
[time=1778] And I suspect that there will be some things that we will learn when we get to heaven about some of the symbolism and about some of the meaning that is here even after we've exhausted the Old Testament and the New Testament trying to allow the Bible to interpret itself.
[time=1790] That when we finally get to heaven we'll go oh that's of course, yes. There'll be like saying oh yeah two comings makes perfect sense.
[time=1797] So for this morning I want to move through these chapters and kind of touch on the mountaintops with this theme of deception and we'll begin with the deceiver.
[time=1806] Look at chapter 12 verse 7. There was war in heaven Michael and his angels waging war with the dragon.
[time=1816] And the dragon and his angels waged war and they were not strong enough and there was no longer a place found for them in heaven.
[time=1824] And the great dragon was thrown down. The serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan who deceives the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him.
[time=1835] Now I don't know how angels fight. They're not physical beings. They're spiritual beings and I don't know if they shoot at each other with something or if it's a battle of truth versus air or if it's all that stuff described.
[time=1845] In Ephesians 6 the powers and the principalities. We're not exactly sure how they fight but we are confident that they do do battle and at this particular point in history now.
[time=1854] This is unique. This is a one time event. This is yet future. Satan is thrown out of heaven and confined to the earth.
[time=1863] So he no longer has access to the throne room of God where he would bring accusation as he did against Job and his evil angels are thrown down with him.
[time=1874] As you know by this time in the history of the world the demons that have been held in the abyss they have been freed and it appears that they too are confined in their evil ministry to the earth.
[time=1887] And so you have Satan himself all the evil angels that have been having access to heaven they are thrown down to earth and the other evil angels that have been confined are free and loose to move in and around earth.
[time=1899] And at first it's a point of great rejoicing in verse 10 I heard a loud voice in having saying now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of Christ have come.
[time=1910] In other words they are rejoicing that he has been thrown out of heaven. For the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down who accuses them before our God day and night.
[time=1919] And it is a point of celebration it is a beginning of the end for Satan and he now finds he'll never have access there again into the heavens where from whence he has been thrown.
[time=1930] Verse 12 for this reason rejoice so heavens and you who dwell in them.
[time=1935] But look at verse 12 whoa to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you having great wrath knowing that he has only a short time.
[time=1948] And so while we believe that Satan is very well aware of the book of Revelation he sees written on the page the end of his own life as it is before he is thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=1960] He does not give up he is not a quitter and you say to yourself well if you knew that you were going to end up dying why wouldn't you just give up.
[time=1969] And I would say very normally to that if I thought my was for sure I was going to lose a basketball game that doesn't mean I quit I don't give up I continue to play in the hope that maybe even the slim hope that I might turn that thing around and be victorious.
[time=1984] And Satan is just like that I believe he knows his end is near I believe he knows the rest of the book of Revelation he can as you if you will feel the fire of hell but that forces him and causes him to work even harder.
[time=1998] In the slim hope that he might be victorious that he might turn it around.
[time=2004] So the time is short he's out of heaven he's thrown on earth and here he comes verse 13 when the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child that of course is the nation of Israel and the male child is Christ himself.
[time=2019] And he makes war with them and pursues them but his warfare you'll look there in verse 15 the serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman so that he might cause her to be swept away with the flood.
[time=2034] And there's a good possibility that is an actual literal water flood and verse 16 God gives him protection he helped the woman and the earth open its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon poured out of his mouth.
[time=2046] So there is a level of protection for the nation of Israel that God extends to them at that time.
[time=2052] But the efforts of Satan during this particular period of time we believe the last three and a half years of the tribulation are not of this physical nature.
[time=2061] They are not seeking to wipe people out physically literally at that point in time not to bring physical harm instead he seeks to deceive with an effort and a level that he never has before.
[time=2074] And that introduces the deceivers, deceivers and we find them in chapter 13.
[time=2080] They are first the antichrist verse one and he stood on the sand of the seashore and I saw a beast coming up out of the sea and there is all that descriptive writing about him.
[time=2094] He apparently has had a wound that slew him verse three and I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain and his fatal wound was healed.
[time=2105] And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast and they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast.
[time=2113] So there is a being we believe this to be a human being a man who is marvelously gifted who is capable of drawing all the nations of the world together underneath his political economic religious and by the way that will all be unified at this time in the world's history under his political religious and economic power.
[time=2133] And he amazes the world because he has been dead but has come back to life or at least has given the appearance of that.
[time=2142] And he receives his power from Satan from the dragon.
[time=2150] Now let's leave him for a minute we'll come back come with me to the false prophet in verses 11 and following and I saw another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon.
[time=2162] And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence and he makes the earth and those who dwell in it worship the first beast whose fatal wound was healed.
[time=2173] Now let me give you an idea here.
[time=2176] This has a lot of similarities to the Trinity.
[time=2179] In fact some people have said that Satan being thrown out of heaven comes now to try to set up a satanic Trinity with himself as the father the antichrist as parallel to the son and keep in mind there are some strong parallels there this antichrist has been killed and resurrected.
[time=2200] And also he finds his authority from his father Satan and we know that was true of Christ.
[time=2206] Christ found his authority to do his ministry from God the father Mark 1127 all things have been handed over to me by my father and so there's a delegated sense of his authority to minister on earth that comes directly from the father.
[time=2221] He always did and only did the work of the father while on earth and then the third member of this satanic Trinity the false prophet who some suggest may not even be in the may principally be a demon himself because he comes out of the earth and some suggest maybe that's coming out of the abyss.
[time=2243] But his ministry his whole function is to bring glory if you will to the first beast.
[time=2249] You see that in verse 12 he makes the earth and those who dwell in it worship the first beast whose fatal wound was healed and that's reminiscent of John chapter 16 and Christ is speaking there about the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2263] And he says that the ministry of the Holy Spirit isn't to bring glory to himself the Holy Spirit never puts himself on display the Holy Spirit always puts Christ on display.
[time=2273] John 16 verse 13 but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all the truth and he will speak not of his own initiative but whatever he hears he will speak and he will disclose to you what is to come.
[time=2285] He shall glorify me for he shall take of mine and shall disclose it to you.
[time=2291] And you know that about the Holy Spirit his ministry on earth in this particular time has never been to draw attention to himself we don't pray to the Holy Spirit we don't seek things from the Holy Spirit we seek things from God through the Holy Spirit that brings us back to a vital connection in Christ.
[time=2309] His ministry has always been to exalt Christ and so there seems to be here a strange sort of satanic trinity that is set up through the antichrist and the false prophet.
[time=2324] You say how do they do this? How do they pull off this remarkable deception?
[time=2331] Well it is through their signs and wonders. Look at chapter 12 verse 9 they are remarkably successful they will deceive the whole world.
[time=2343] You'll notice the great dragon thrown down the serpent of old who is called the devil and Satan who deceives the whole world he was thrown down to the earth but he deceives the whole world.
[time=2353] Chapter 13 verse 3 the antichrist I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain his fatal wound was healed and the whole world was amazed and followed after the beast.
[time=2366] The false prophet chapter 13 verse 12 he exercises all authority of the first beast in his presence and he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast.
[time=2377] In other words this worldwide international ministry of deception brings people to worship the first beast or the antichrist so they are incredibly successful in this.
[time=2389] How do they do it verse 13 he performs great signs so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth and the presence of men and he deceives those who dwell on the earth because the signs which it was given to him to perform in the presence of the beast.
[time=2407] Remember we just studied the two witnesses who were faithful and true to God and they were verified and validated by their miracles so apparently running along with them in concert is the antichrist and this false prophet who are doing all kinds of supernatural miraculous signs and are being incredibly successful.
[time=2426] One of the ability that was given to the two witnesses was to burn people up with a fire that comes out of their mouth and we saw that went back probably to Elijah and hear this false prophet can do somewhat the same he can make fire come down out of heaven.
[time=2441] So they have a competing signs and wonders for the attention and the applauds and the faithfulness and the allegiance of humanity and they are very successful in it.
[time=2452] They draw special attention here in verse 14 of chapter 13.
[time=2457] The false prophet tells those who draw on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound and of the sword has come to life. In other words make an image of the antichrist.
[time=2467] And there was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast might even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
[time=2479] Apparently this is very significant because of all the signs and wonders that the beast, the antichrist and the false prophet are doing this one is highlighted.
[time=2488] And apparently it has some overwhelming impact on the nations and on the world in their ability to deceive.
[time=2498] So it seems as if Satan having been thrown out of heaven realizing that his time is near the end.
[time=2506] He attempts knowing that back in Revelation 4 and 5 there was the deed and you remember that was the title deed of the earth.
[time=2512] The whole idea of Christ taking back the earth which was rightfully his and will eventually reign for a thousand years.
[time=2518] Satan's sensing that this is where this is going, his last frontier, his last opportunity, his last place to have a domain of his own and for people to follow him is planet earth.
[time=2528] And so he goes back to earth and sets up a false satanic trinity and the effort and the energy therein is for deception.
[time=2536] It's not to kill the people directly, it's to cause them to continue to reject God and reject Christ and choose him instead.
[time=2544] He seems to want to lock earth up so tightly and so completely under his deceptive control that there will be no room for Christ to come back and receive the earth to himself.
[time=2555] So the organization of this plot seems to be a satanic trinity, the scheme clearly is the emphasis on deception as opposed to physical wounding or killing.
[time=2564] The tools of this deception are the signs and wonders that they are able to accomplish and the scope of it is the entire world.
[time=2572] It's overwhelming.
[time=2574] So the deceiver satan himself, the deceivers, deceivers, the antichrist and the false prophet and now look with me at the deceived, those who buy into this.
[time=2585] What happens to them? Come to chapter 14.
[time=2589] Verse 9, "Another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image,
[time=2601] "and receives a mark on his forehead or upon his hand, "he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength and the cup of his anger.
[time=2613] "And he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
[time=2620] "And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image,
[time=2627] "whoever receives the mark of his name." Say what mark? We'll go back to chapter 13 to look at 16, 17 and 18. This is the mark of the beast.
[time=2638] Here is a description of the effect of this satanic deception.
[time=2643] He causes all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free men and the slaves.
[time=2648] That's everybody on the earth, by the way. Those are the only categories people fit into.
[time=2651] You're either small or you're great, you're rich or you're poor, you're free or you're a slave. That's just a way to describe everybody on the earth.
[time=2657] To be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, he coerces them. He demands their allegiance,
[time=2664] where he can't deceive them by being whimsical. He forces this through his political, economic and religious structure
[time=2672] that everybody has to have this mark. If you don't, verse 17, you're not able to buy or sell,
[time=2678] except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name.
[time=2683] Here is wisdom, let him who understands, calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man.
[time=2689] And his number is 666. And all kinds of extravagant things have tried to be done with the number 666
[time=2695] and try to tie it to certain individuals. In many languages, people will put a numerical value to certain letters
[time=2702] and so they'll take people's names like Atticus, Epiphanes, who was thought to be the Antichrist or Hitler or Mussolini
[time=2709] or some other person and they'll equate his actual name, sometimes its first name, sometimes its first and last name,
[time=2715] whatever works in their formula, and they'll try to bring it back to an equation of 666, the number 666.
[time=2721] They'll try to identify the beast. The point is clear, God doesn't want us identifying the beast.
[time=2726] He doesn't want us to come up with who this person is going to be, it's impossible, it's yet future, leave it alone, let it be this, the number is that of a man. The Antichrist will be a man.
[time=2738] We don't know which one, but he will be a man. He will be powerful and awesome.
[time=2745] Now then, back to chapter 14, you'll find, if you take that mark, the mark of the man to yourself,
[time=2754] that will be your entrance ticket into eternal hell. Verse 9, he receives the mark on his forehead on his hand.
[time=2763] They will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of his anger.
[time=2770] The world has never seen this before. If you look at the wrath of God in other situations, even in the Old Testament,
[time=2777] you'll find that it was mitigated in some way or in some portion in either length or severity.
[time=2783] But here comes the full strength, undiluted, unmitigated wrath of God.
[time=2790] You see, what is that? To be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the Lord,
[time=2796] the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they will have no rest day and night,
[time=2802] those who worship the beast and the image, those who receive the mark of his name.
[time=2809] So it is a horrible, horrible lot. It is the end of their life.
[time=2815] You know, when you try to get people to make good choices today, sometimes you need to show them tomorrow,
[time=2822] and the consequences of their decision. There have been some great ads out on smoking that try to say,
[time=2828] while it looks really popular and it looks like a lot of fun, it makes you kind of feel a certain way as far as being accepted in some particular group,
[time=2835] they will endeavor to show the end of smoking and show what happens to the human lungs and show people dying of cancer in the hospital
[time=2843] and trying to say, "Hey, before you start here, look at what it brings you to. Look at what it eventuates."
[time=2851] And God, I think very graciously here, shows us, he cuts through the gloss of Satan's incredibly deceptive situation.
[time=2858] The people who are being deceived by Satan in this particular time, they won't think they're being to save.
[time=2863] They'll be sincerely believing in the Antichrist. They will sincerely be giving their allegiance to this one
[time=2870] who they believe is attested to by signs and wonders as the one that they should worship and follow.
[time=2878] And God goes behind the scenes and tries to show them, if you do that, if you place your confidence and your trust in him by receiving his mark,
[time=2888] you will end up forever tormented in hell, unrelenting pain.
[time=2895] Well, there is this dark, dark picture of deception, but in the midst of it, there are the underseaved, and let's look at them for a minute.
[time=2903] There are four little vignettes of the underseaved, it begins in chapter 12, verse 17.
[time=2910] This is the group I want to be in.
[time=2913] This is the group I'm thankful I am in, and if I live in this day, I would hope I have the courage to live in.
[time=2918] Speaking of Israel, 1st, chapter 12, verse 17, and the dragon was enraged with the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring,
[time=2930] who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.
[time=2937] They are described here as keeping the commandments of God and holding to the testimony of Christ.
[time=2947] They are the underseaved, they will not fall into the sin of the end of the age, they will not deny Christ.
[time=2955] Look at chapter 13, verses 8 and 10.
[time=2960] Another little picture of the underseaved, this time not the nation of Israel, and all who dwell on the earth will worship him.
[time=2967] Everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the lamb who has been slain.
[time=2975] In other words, everybody accepts those whose names have been written from the foundation of the world in the lamb's book of life will fall in this deception.
[time=2985] And there we find that the remarkable love of God that would pursue people from before the foundation of the world
[time=2992] and put their name in the lamb's book of life, they survive this time.
[time=2995] Survive it, i.e., they don't fall to the deception of the dragon and his false prophet and the any Christ.
[time=3004] Look at chapter 14, verses 4 and 5, a beautiful picture of faithfulness to our Lord in the midst of all of this.
[time=3011] These are the ones speaking of the 144,000 who have not been the filed with the women.
[time=3017] Excuse me, with women, in other words they are sexually pure, for they have kept themselves chaste.
[time=3023] They are the ones who follow the lamb wherever he goes.
[time=3027] These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the lamb, and no lie was found in their mouth.
[time=3034] That's interesting. In an age of escalating deception, they are absolutely full of truth.
[time=3040] And they are blameless, a word that describes maturity in their faith.
[time=3044] So these undesives stand undefiled, chaste, sexually pure, following the lamb wherever he goes without lying in their mouth and blameless in their behavior.
[time=3056] And then chapter 14, look at verses 12 and 13.
[time=3064] Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
[time=3075] I don't know if you can see it any clearer anywhere else in the New Testament, to come to Christ and to be truly born again means that you are going to keep the commandments of God.
[time=3087] If these people in this day, under this kind of persecution, when they come to Christ, stay faithful to Him all the way to the end.
[time=3096] And that faithfulness is defined by their keeping the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3103] Now anyone can believe that you can come to Christ and live a habitually, characteristically sinful life escapes my understanding.
[time=3113] Because it's taught all through the New Testament and then again reinforced right here in this climactic point of world history that the true believers are marked by their perseverance.
[time=3123] And what is their perseverance? Their faithful, continual, unending obedience to the commandments of God.
[time=3131] There is no such thing as a habitually, characteristically, disobedient Christian.
[time=3139] Believers faithfully follow the Word of God. Yes, there may be times of struggle. Yes, there may be times of disobedience.
[time=3147] But obviously here, disobedience to step on the other end of the line, to step over the divider between the side of Christ and the side of Satan is to have lost your perseverance,
[time=3158] is to have lost your ability to obey the commandments of God and therefore to reveal you were never truly saved in the first place.
[time=3165] There are only two camps. There are only two camps spiritually. You're either in Satan's camp or you're in Christ's camp.
[time=3172] And those who are known to be in Christ's camp are not so because they made a profession of faith.
[time=3179] It says nowhere here that they made a profession of faith.
[time=3183] It says that they are keeping the commandments of God and their faith in Christ and we understand that a faith that is a true faith works.
[time=3192] So even as we look to the end of the age, we find those who are truly saved to evidence that salvation in their perseverance defined as their faithful obedience unto death.
[time=3205] And that is exactly what's happening to these, undeceived. They are obeying and for their obedience they are being killed.
[time=3214] So it's a strong encouragement, isn't it?
[time=3218] Strong encouragement.
[time=3220] Well as we close, let's go to Titus chapter 3, just one more scripture. Titus 3, 3.
[time=3234] And this is just a wonderful point that the Bible makes about you and me lest we should be arrogant about being the undeceived.
[time=3245] Titus chapter 3 verse 3 says this, "For we also once were foolish, disobedient and deceived."
[time=3254] There isn't a person in this room who hasn't been deceived. And I mean by that, deceived outside of Christ, unsaved, lost in our sin.
[time=3265] And though you may have come to Christ at an early age, that by the grace of God, all of us were once foolish and disobedient and deceived.
[time=3274] And enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending our life in malice and envy and hateful, hating one another.
[time=3284] But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, who saved who?
[time=3291] He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy by the washing of a generation and renewing by the Holy Spirit,
[time=3303] whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ. That being justified by His grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
[time=3315] You know why we're not over here on the side of the deceived? Because God chose to save us, God poured His grace and His mercy out on us through the person of Christ.
[time=3325] Instead of our end in life being to be bound to hell forever and ever where the smoke of our torment would rise day after day after day after day forever and ever,
[time=3335] it is instead the grace that has made us heirs according to the hope of eternal life. No merit of our own.
[time=3343] Nothing, not our own ingenuity, not our own thinking processes, but the mere grace of God spares us from being lost and blinded in our sins and full deception under Satan,
[time=3355] and by the grace of God transferred out of that lost state into the light.
[time=3361] And it's our privilege now to walk in the light, to walk worthy of our calling. Let's pray together.
[time=3371] Father, we're thankful as we peek behind the curtains of humanity and see the spiritual warfare that goes on.
[time=3379] We're thankful one that we see you winning.
[time=3383] We see that you are in charge, that you are in control, and that even Michael and his angels are strong enough to throw the dragon and his demons out of heaven.
[time=3394] We're thankful that we see in our own lives our own sin and our own unrighteousness and our own need for Christ,
[time=3402] which is the greatest evidence that we're not deceived.
[time=3405] We've come to the conclusion of another Bible Hour program.
[time=3415] We hope that you were encouraged by the music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Michelle Smeckens. The message today was from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3425] Just before we close today, I'd like to pray this prayer, not only for those of you that might want to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,
[time=3432] but those of you that just have a special need and you need Christ to intercede in your life right now. Let's pray together.
[time=3438] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed in.
[time=3447] I need you as my Savior. I ask you to come into my heart and be my Savior today.
[time=3452] And then for those that have particular needs, maybe physical hurts or emotional needs right now, we pray that you'll intercede in their lives and you'll help them in a particular way today.
[time=3462] In Jesus' name I pray, amen. If you prayed the prayer with me, would you write to us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3471] And when you write to us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
