[time=0] as we look across the sea of humanity throughout the history of the world, we see the common
[time=16] denominators, everyone seeking health, everyone seeking family, everyone seeking something to eat and everybody seeking some purpose in life and they make the best of it as they can in their attempt to live in harmony with the power or powers that are bigger than themselves, we call it religion.
[time=46] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=52] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=54] Thank you for joining us.
[time=56] What does God think of the other religions of the world?
[time=60] How does he view the Mormons, Jehovah Witnesses and those involved in Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam?
[time=67] Many people think that all of these different religions lead to the same heaven and to the same God, that there is only one God behind all these different religions and that he will
[time=78] accept all people as they strive to reach him.
[time=82] Revelation 17 tells us about God's view of these various religious systems and describes his mighty judgment upon them.
[time=90] Stay with us for this exciting study of God's Word.
[time=93] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available.
[time=97] Pastor Moore will be speaking from the book of Revelation 17.
[time=102] Our special music today will be provided by reflection and Laurie Scheiman.
[time=114] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.

[time=1048] Thank you, Lori.
[time=1062] Lori is a graduate of Black Hawk Christian School and is attending Cedarville and has come home for the summer and we're thankful that she's here.
[time=1069] Well, if you'll take your Bibles with me this morning, we come to the portion of our service where we study the Word of God.
[time=1077] And so let's go to Revelation chapter 17. We're in a study of the book of Revelation and we're trying to take the major themes of the end of the age and learn from them and apply them to our lives that we might be living in light of eternity.
[time=1094] When last we left off our study of the book of Revelation, we were at a point where we were ready for the Battle of Armageddon because chapter 16 leaves us there. God sends out these evil spirits into the nations of the world and draws them together in verse 16 of chapter 16,
[time=1111] gathering them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon. But the chronology of the book stops right there for a few chapters.
[time=1119] We go into chapter 17 and 18 and we go back to an earlier part in the tribulation and God is going to fill in some details, important details for us that he passed over.
[time=1130] He's almost like a good newspaper article where the title is very catching and the first couple of paragraphs have all the high points of the information and then as the article develops he goes back and starts filling in some of the pieces.
[time=1144] That's what's happening in chapter 17 and 18 and the pieces he's filling in are an understanding of what he calls in chapter 17 verse 5, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots of the abominations of the earth.
[time=1158] And Babylon in chapter 17 is referred to as the religious Babylon and then next week we'll come to chapter 18 and see the false world system of Babylon in economics and political influence.
[time=1172] But let's begin by reading verses 1 through 6, Revelation chapter 17.
[time=1177] And one of the seven angels who had seven bowls came and spoke with me saying, "Come here, I shall show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,
[time=1187] with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality and those who dwell on the earth were made drunk with the wine of her immorality.
[time=1195] And he carried me away in the spirit into a wilderness and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast full of blasphemous names having seven heads and ten horns.
[time=1204] And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality.
[time=1215] Upon her forehead a name was written, a mystery, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth.
[time=1224] And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.
[time=1230] And when I saw her I wondered greatly.
[time=1234] This chapter describes the ultimate end of all the false religions of the world.
[time=1241] Those who have committed acts of spiritual adultery are fully and finally dealt with here in the book of Revelation chapter 17.
[time=1250] All the people who have ever lived who are outwardly religious, sincere as the day is long, yet guilty of spiritual prostitution,
[time=1259] are dealt with here described as harlots or whores because they worship false gods.
[time=1266] This is the final end of all the religious systems of the world that promised heaven to people but instead delivered death and hell.
[time=1276] Cults like the Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mormons, Christian science, the worldwide church of God, non-Christian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism and Islam find their culmination here in this chapter.
[time=1290] And so did the secular religions of the world, atheism, Marxism, existentialism and humanism to name but a few.
[time=1300] They all come to a moment of judgment. Look at chapter 17 verse 1 again, "Come here, I shall show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters."
[time=1311] And this is a difficult concept for a lot of people.
[time=1314] They see the people of the world, they see the people in Japan and India and Russia and China and they go around the globe and their mind and they see all of these people basically trying to do the same stuff with their life.
[time=1329] They're trying to be married to somebody else and eke out a decent existence with their spouse, they're trying to raise their kids, they're trying to make a living in the workplace, they're trying to stay as healthy as they can, live as long as they can.
[time=1342] It'd be nice to have a sense of purpose and they're trying to figure out what's going to happen to them in life after death.
[time=1350] People like this view the world and those common denominators and they see the sincerity of people's hearts and they see the dedication with which they apply themselves to their false religious system and the commitment they have to it oftentimes more commitment, at least externally than the Christians due to their own faith.
[time=1368] And they come to the conclusion that there really is just one marvelous benevolent power or being that is transcending all these false religions or all these, as they would call them, various religions of the earth.
[time=1381] And when the dust settles and time has stopped, what we're going to find out is that there really wasn't one true God and one true way to that true God.
[time=1390] Everything will just kind of amalgamate into this benevolent being and we'll all find ourselves worshiping this one supreme being in the same marvelous bliss of life after death.
[time=1407] They say things like this, shouldn't all religions be regarded as different roads to the same destination?
[time=1416] And rather than seeing just one God of these many religions to be the only true God, wouldn't it make a little more sense to accept the notion that there is a principle or a person or a power beyond and behind all of these various religions who is the one true God?
[time=1433] And that in approaching that one true God, the details such as doctrine and dogma and theology aren't really that important.
[time=1442] What's really important is the common craving of the human heart.
[time=1447] And with that, allow each individual to find or work out for himself an eclectic faith from which he can grab from all the great religions of the world of history.
[time=1460] You want to say things like, you know Russell, if you were born in China, you wouldn't be a Christian, you'd be an atheist like the vast majority of the billion people who live there.
[time=1471] And if you had been born in Mexico City, you wouldn't be a Christian, you'd be a Catholic like the vast majority of the people who live in the city of Mexico or the city of Mexico, Mexico City.
[time=1484] If you were born in Egypt, you wouldn't be a Christian, you'd worship in the same religious system as all the Egyptians do.
[time=1493] And if you were born in Israel and happen to have been born in Jew, you wouldn't be a Christian, you'd be Jewish.
[time=1501] Give yourself a break, stop making it sound as if yours is the only true religion, because probably the only reason you're even a Christian is because you're born in America, and you had Christian parents.
[time=1518] Isn't this a little cultural? I mean, where do we get off saying that these other religious systems and their understanding of God are wrong?
[time=1533] Where do we get off being so dogmatic? Let's just be a little more enlightened. Let's just look across the sea of humanity throughout the history of the world and recognize these many common denominators of the human need for health and family and food and purpose.
[time=1551] And their common attempt and this thing called religion to be at peace with whatever power is out there, why say there is only one right way and all the other ways are wrong?
[time=1566] Why can't we just come to the conclusion that there are many different names for the same God and let it go at that?
[time=1575] And why would we want to assume if there is a true God that he would punish the people of the world for simply calling him the wrong name or approaching him in a slightly different direction than some other people did?
[time=1588] Would it be better to understand that that God would be the same God of Islam and Mormonism and Catholicism and receive all of the sincere devotees based upon the sincerity of their heart rather than on their allegiance to some very prescribed dogma or doctrine?
[time=1612] Revelation 17 answers these questions. Revelation 17 gives you God's perspective to these answers.
[time=1620] And we'll look at them as he presents them the judgment of the great harlot and we will look at her identity.
[time=1627] We will look at her description and we will look at her final hour. Her identity, her description and her final hour.
[time=1636] You say to me, Russell, why are you talking about the religions of the world? The word religion doesn't even appear in Revelation 17.
[time=1643] Where do you get off thinking that this is a chapter all about the religions of the world?
[time=1648] The answer comes, number one, in her identity. Look at verse 5.
[time=1652] Speaking of the harlot, there is upon her forehead a name and that was not uncommon in John's day. He wrote about 90 AD and harlots typically had that indicated on their forehead, somehow written and marked there.
[time=1665] But he says that this harlot had a name written on her forehead and the name is this, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and of the abominations of the earth.
[time=1675] Now this word Babylon is used in Scripture sometimes of the city of Babylon.
[time=1680] Other times it's used of the great kingdom of the Babylonians and Nebuchadnezzar was their most famous leader who took them to their point of power in world history.
[time=1690] But other times, often very frequently, the word Babylon is used in the word of God to describe the false religious systems of the world.
[time=1700] Babylon in these cases is a counterfeit or pseudo-Christian religion which plagued Israel and which plagued the church in the New Testament.
[time=1709] In fact, Babylon is seen in the word of God as the source of all false religious systems. And through our study of the book of Revelation, I have taken you to the Old Testament as few times as possible.
[time=1723] But this morning we do need to go there, so if you'll hold your finger there in Revelation 17 and come back with me to Genesis 9.
[time=1733] Genesis 9, we'll be back here for just a few moments but I think it's necessary to understand Babylon the Great.
[time=1742] In Genesis 9, God is speaking to Noah after the flood.
[time=1748] Noah and his family went into the ark as you know God destroyed all the people on the planet and when they came out there was no false religion on the earth.
[time=1757] There were no false gods, all the people who had worshiped those false gods and those idols had been destroyed. Now there was just the faithful remnant of Noah.
[time=1766] And so this is the beginning point. This is our beginning of our understanding of Babylon the Great.
[time=1772] What did God say to Noah? Verse 1 of chapter 9, God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth."
[time=1784] He commanded them to go into all the regions of the earth which had no population, to be fruitful and to multiply and to repopulate the earth spread out all over the world.
[time=1797] Well, they didn't want to do that or at least some of them didn't. Come to chapter 10 for a minute and let me introduce you to one of the descendants of Noah.
[time=1805] Chapter 10 verse 6, you see here the sons of Ham. Ham was a son of Noah and you come down to meet one of them in verse 8.
[time=1814] Now Kush became the father of a man by the name of Nimrod and he is the principal figure we're looking for here in this text Nimrod.
[time=1822] He became a mighty one on the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord therefore it is said like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord.
[time=1830] Now verse 10, "And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel." The beginning of his kingdom was Babel.
[time=1838] You say, "Tell me about Babel." I say turn the page, come to chapter 11.
[time=1844] And here is the story of Babel in the beginning of Babylon and the beginning of all the world's false religious systems.
[time=1851] Chapter 11 verse 1, "Now the whole earth used the same language and the same words and it came about as they journeyed east.
[time=1857] They found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there." And they said to another, "Come, let us make bricks and burn them thoroughly and they used brick for stone and they used tar for mortar."
[time=1870] Now here it is verse 4, "And they said, 'Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower whose top will reach into heaven and let us make for ourselves a name lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.'
[time=1886] Now people have often taught this passage wrongly. You may have learned it incorrectly in your Sunday school class.
[time=1892] When I was taught it, they said the big sin about the tower of Babel was that they were trying to build a tower whose top would reach into heaven
[time=1899] and therefore find their way to heaven by walking up, as I remembered in my book, the spiral staircase or whatever, as it wrapped around the outside of this cone.
[time=1907] And they could eventually get the heaven on their own, just show up one day and say we made it.
[time=1911] We're here, hi God, we climbed up the tower of Babel.
[time=1915] That's not what this means. Look again.
[time=1918] And remember, Genesis 9-1, "God told them to multiply and fill the earth."
[time=1924] Now verse 4, "Come, let us build for ourselves a city and a tower," now this is a descriptive phrase.
[time=1930] What does it look like? Whose top will reach into heaven?
[time=1934] It just seems to describe that it's going to be a real tall tower.
[time=1937] Well, why should it be real tall? Keep reading. Let us make a name for ourselves.
[time=1942] Here it is, lest we be scattered abroad over the face of the whole earth.
[time=1947] In other words, these people didn't have maps. They didn't have compasses.
[time=1951] They didn't know how to hold themselves together in solidarity.
[time=1954] They could easily go out and do their hunting or do their scavenging or do whatever they did and not find their way back to their original location.
[time=1961] So the tower was needed, whose top was very tall, as a rallying point, so they could all stay in community with one another,
[time=1969] build a name for themselves in direct violation to Genesis 9-1, where God said, scatter yourselves across the faith of the earth.
[time=1977] Repopulate the earth.
[time=1981] You say, "Okay." So we've got rebellion against God.
[time=1985] In the period of this rebellion, in the making of this tower of Babel, Nimrod married a woman, had a wife.
[time=1993] She was known as the High Priestess of the Religion of Babel.
[time=1999] Her name was Simea Ramas.
[time=2002] She was the one who was coming up with the religious garb and the religious genre of the day.
[time=2009] She, by the way, said, as the High Priestess of the Religion of Babel, said that she had conceived miraculously.
[time=2015] In fact, it was a sunbeam that had touched her body and she had conceived and gave birth eventually to a son by the name of Tamuz,
[time=2024] who she offered to the world as their deliverer and savior.
[time=2031] As you might expect, listening to the parallel between this young boy Tamuz and Christ, he grew up, and when he grew up, he was killed by a wild beast.
[time=2042] He lay dead for 40 days, according to their religion, and was then resurrected. He came back to life.
[time=2051] He was the savior.
[time=2054] Now, this great religious system began to breed and give, take root in the heart of Nimrod, his wife and all the people,
[time=2062] as they built and direct disobedience to God, a tower to keep them from being scattered abroad on the face of the earth.
[time=2068] You know what happened? Verse 7, God looked down upon the people and chose to confuse their language that they may not understand one another's speech.
[time=2076] Verse 8, "So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of the whole earth, and they stopped building the city."
[time=2084] Therefore, its name was called Babel because the Lord confused the language of the whole earth, and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of the whole earth.
[time=2092] And guess what went with them when they got scattered? Their false religious system.
[time=2098] And it came out in all different forms and shapes, the basic central message of Semiramis and her son Tamuz.
[time=2106] In the Phoenicians, she was called Asteroth, and he was called Baal, which should be familiar to you if you studied the Old Testament.
[time=2113] In Egypt, she was called Iris, and he was called Osiris. In Greece, she was called Aphroditis, and he was called Eoros.
[time=2122] And in Rome, she was called Venice, and interestingly, he was called Cupid.
[time=2128] Now, if you don't think about the history of world religion, you'll find there the seat of all the world religious systems, and they all find their common denominator and beginning in the false religious system of the tower of Babel.
[time=2142] From these very origins come all the false religions of the world. You might be interested to know that when Babylon was eventually destroyed, the high priest gathered all the paraphernalia, all the images, and all the idols, and all the trinkets, and all the stuff.
[time=2158] And he went to a place called Pergamos. He was eventually driven out of Pergamos and found his home in Rome, where that the city of Rome became the center of the Babylonian mystery religions.
[time=2172] The chief high priest of the Babylonian religion in Rome took the title for himself, "Puntafix Maximum", which became the title of every Roman emperor to follow, and is now the title of the pope, who in reality is not the successor of Peter the fisherman, but even he finds his roots back to the tower of Babel.
[time=2194] For it is the high priest of the Babylon mystery religion and the servant of the fish god, Dagen, from which his title is derived.
[time=2204] So even to the contemporary church of Catholicism we can find their roots back to the tower of Babel.
[time=2214] Back to Revelation chapter 17. Hope you understand now why chapter 17 is understood to be the end of all world false religious systems, because Babel, Babylon the Great, is the term, and we could trace this through Scripture, but don't have time this morning.
[time=2231] Oftentimes used for the false religious systems of the world who find all of them their seat at the tower of Babel.
[time=2240] So it is clearly identified as the false religious system of the world.
[time=2247] So her identity, she becomes one big massive religious system.
[time=2252] At the beginning of the tribulation the antichrist comes on the scene, and with his personality and his demonic power, he finds a way to draw all the religious systems of the world together into one great, unanimous, harmonious, religious system.
[time=2268] That is then called Babylon overtly and directly.
[time=2274] Secondly, let's look at her description. Tell me more about her. We'll come back to verse 1 with me for a minute, chapter 17.
[time=2280] He says, "Come here, I shall show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters." He calls these false religious systems prostitutes or whores. What do they do? Verse 2.
[time=2291] If the kings of the earth, they commit acts of immorality, and those who dwell on the earth, that is a technical phrase referring to everybody else on the earth, those who dwell on the earth, they were made drunk with the wine of her immorality.
[time=2304] Then you say to yourself, "Wait a minute, why is God calling these false religious system prostitutes and harlots?"
[time=2313] Because a lot of the false religious systems of the world really promote chastity. They're very moral. They're restricted in their behavior.
[time=2322] Why is God linking them to harlotry and to immorality?
[time=2327] Well, the answer to that is very simple. God is not talking about physical fornication or physical sex or intercourse when he speaks of the harlot and her immorality.
[time=2336] He is speaking about spiritual immorality, spiritual fornication.
[time=2341] And oftentimes he does that. Just stay right there for a minute. I'll read you a passage out of Isaiah 54 where God describes himself as the husband of the nation of Israel.
[time=2352] To describe the intimacy of their religious union in Isaiah 54 verse 5 he says, "For your husband is your maker, i.e. that's me.
[time=2363] I'm God. I'm your husband, whose name is the Lord of hosts and your edeemer is the holy one of Israel who is called the son, excuse me, who is called the God of all the earth.
[time=2373] For the Lord has called you like a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit even like a wife of one's youth when she is rejected."
[time=2383] That same theme carries into the New Testament. The New Testament church is given the unique title of the bride of Christ.
[time=2390] She is the bride of Christ. Paul says of her in 2 Corinthians 11, "For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy.
[time=2398] For I betrothed you to one husband, that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin."
[time=2406] The notion then is not a physical immorality but spiritual immorality. Do you understand that God views your commitment to him with the same level of intimacy, the personal nature, the commitments of a marriage vow.
[time=2423] And you enter into a unique spiritual union with him. God views your heart commitment as an intimate, sacred bond of marriage and to give yourself in worship to any other, God is to commit acts of spiritual adultery.
[time=2439] And because the text calls us to this, you need to think about the parallels between the physical intimacy of a husband and wife and the spiritual intimacy between a man and his maker, the true and living God.
[time=2452] Both physical and spiritual union are these. They are the celebration of your union. They are the reaffirmation of your commitment and your allegiance to that other person or to your God.
[time=2463] They are the expression of intimate and personal relationship in which true knowledge and understanding of the other person or in religion, true religion of God is being pursued.
[time=2473] And it is the satisfying of the greatest longing of the desires of the soul. So what it is in marriage and in the marriage bed, it is in worship.
[time=2484] When you come in here to worship God, God views what you are doing as intimate and as personal as when a man and a wife have physical relationship.
[time=2495] You in worshiping him reaffirm your union to him, your commitment to him, your intimacy with him, the level of commitment you have in your relationship with him and it is the satisfying of the longing of your heart.
[time=2508] And just as a man would go to a harlot and find relationship with her and thereby break the vow of single-mindedness and loyalty and faithfulness and love to his wife when a human being worships a false God.
[time=2525] Likewise, he breaks the obvious obligation that he has of single-mindedness and loyalty and faithfulness and love to his true creator.
[time=2536] So God takes it very personal. God sees it as adultery. God sees it as fornication.
[time=2542] And the false church in his mind is committing illicit acts of intercourse with false gods and false world systems.
[time=2552] So the contrast is very stark. The bride of Christ is pure. She's chased. She's undefiled. She has reserved herself for the groom, who by the way, by the shedding of his own blood, purchased her and made her that way.
[time=2566] And having been redeemed, she is so transformed by the grace of God that she is faithful and true all the days of her life.
[time=2574] We call that the perseverance of the saints. She never recants. She never turns and she never follows another. And we have seen some of these in the book of Revelation, who have been drawn into or seemingly enticed to worship the anti-Christ, the false prophet, the beast, the image of the beast to receive the mark upon their head to commit spiritual adultery, but the true faithful ones who love Christ say no to that and instead they die.
[time=2602] Verse 6, chapter 17, and I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.
[time=2611] So the contrast of this virgin bride chased, pure, undefiled with this harlot who is filthy. She is defiled. She is used. She is unprincipled. She is dirty.
[time=2626] And she has sold herself to Satan, to the world, to the anti-Christ in full compromise.
[time=2634] In fact, she is so filthy, look at verse 4, and the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, obviously referring to the wealth of many of the false religious systems of the world.
[time=2646] And she has in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and of the unclean things of her immorality.
[time=2656] So defiled is she that she holds in her hand a cup of her own abominations and then she drinks it.
[time=2664] She takes it unto herself. She consumes it. She is polluted and dirty and filthy. That is God's view.
[time=2672] That is God's view of the false religious systems of the world.
[time=2677] He doesn't see them as nobly striving to reach Him. He doesn't see them as becoming acceptable in any way, shape, or form.
[time=2686] He views them as prostitutes, spiritual prostitutes.
[time=2693] And everyone buys into it, verse 2, with whom the kings of the earth committed acts of immorality.
[time=2699] And we know throughout history the kings of the earth, the men who have been in charge, have hung on to one false form of religion or another, and they sell themselves out to it, and with it they commit acts of immorality against God.
[time=2712] And then those who dwell in the earth also in verse 2, they are made drunk with the wine of her immorality. That's a wonderful picture.
[time=2720] That's what happens. People get involved in a false religious system, and like a drunk person they become anesthetized to reality.
[time=2727] They no longer can perceive the fact that they are guilty before God, because they have a false sense of security in this religious system.
[time=2733] They no longer can sense the hound of heaven, if you will, the spirit of God beating down upon them, calling them to repentance, because they are drunk with their false religious system.
[time=2744] They're inebriated. They're anesthetized. They have a pseudo-righteousness. They're a drunken stupor, and they have forgot or stopped caring that they are on their way to hell.
[time=2757] So the picture is very graphic. God does not view these people as noble, sincere, intense efforts at coming to know him as their creator.
[time=2767] He sees them instead in a drunken stupor, which they have brought upon themselves by buying into the spiritual harlotry of a false religious system.
[time=2778] There is no hope for that kind of person to come into the presence of God.
[time=2785] They are polluted and vile. It brings a whole new understanding, doesn't it, to our sinfulness?
[time=2791] We think of our sin primarily in terms of some behavior that we might have done, but God views it as some polluting, prostituting reality that makes us dirty and filthy and unfit for relationship with him.
[time=2803] Our sin is a problem to more than us. It is a problem to God.
[time=2808] So one, her identity, she is Babylon. She is the false religious system of all the world's systems.
[time=2814] Secondly, her description, she is a harlot. She is a prostitute, a whore, a fornicator, filthy and unfit for relationship with God.
[time=2824] Thirdly, what is her final lot? What is her final hour? Judgment.
[time=2830] And you saw that, chapter 17, verse 1.
[time=2834] "Come here, I shall show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters."
[time=2841] By the way, many waters is defined for you in verse 15.
[time=2844] He said to me, "The waters which you saw were the harlot sits are the peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
[time=2851] This false religious system sits on the people of the world. She is their leader, and they all give expression to it in different ways, but God sees them as one simple false religious system that had its origin in Babel."
[time=2867] Her description, this harlotry, and what does she get? She gets judgment.
[time=2873] Hold your finger again in chapter 17. Come back just two or three chapters to Revelation 14, verse 8.
[time=2879] And you'll see this theme of judgment coming on Babylon.
[time=2885] In Revelation 14, 8, "fallen, fallen is Babylon the great. She who has made all the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality."
[time=2897] And the word "passion" there, of course, in this context you see the unbridled passion of physical intercourse.
[time=2904] And the picture carries over into the religious scene, and we see the committed devotees, the monks, the people who have totally just devoured false religious systems
[time=2913] and given themselves to it with a zeal that is unparalleled in other human experience.
[time=2918] But God says, "You're fallen. Fallen is Babylon the great who has made the nations drink of the wine of the passion of her immorality."
[time=2927] Come over to chapter 16 and look at verse 19. Remember chapter 16 is all about the bold judgments, and it's this great, huge, all encompassing judgment upon everybody who's on the earth, but Babylon finds special mention.
[time=2940] She has singled out, and the great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the great was remembered before God
[time=2950] to give her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath.
[time=2956] God has a place in his wrath for the false religious systems of the world that have been leading millions and billions of people to slaughter, to burn forever in hell.
[time=2966] And so in the final moment of judgment, he singles out this religious system, and he delivers to her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath.
[time=2975] You say, "How does he do it?" Come to chapter 17. Look at verse 16.
[time=2981] And here is the irony of it all. At the beginning of the tribulation, the beast works in collusion with the world's systems, the world's religious systems.
[time=2989] They are buddies, they are bedfellows, they are together in this great deceptive plot, but midway through the tribulation, the beast turns on the harlot and rips her to shreds.
[time=3001] Chapter 16 and the tin horns which you saw and the beast, that's the antichrist, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.
[time=3015] That will come a point and time in the tribulation, the midpoint where for the beast to be aligned with this false religious system will no longer be to his advantage, he will turn on here, he will rip her to shreds and he will burn her up, and she will be no more.
[time=3030] And he alone will remain as the false God of the world.
[time=3040] I can think of times when I have sat in churches that were not preaching the gospel.
[time=3045] I can think of a mainline denomination church which I went to because I had family members who went there and on certain holidays I had to go there.
[time=3052] And I can remember seeing these false prophets stand up with a pseudo look of spirituality in their eyes and everybody showed up for that one or two times a year called Christmas or Easter.
[time=3062] And when people would have heard the gospel instead they got lies, they got a prostitution of the truth, they got just enough to make them feel inoculated but not enough to the point of repentance where they could turn from their sin and accept Christ as their personal Savior.
[time=3076] And I remember sitting there thinking God must be very angry with that man.
[time=3082] I can remember going to a commencement exercise of a high school that I graduated to some ten years after my own graduation and there a man was asked to speak from a major denomination.
[time=3092] And he came there was a very gifted communicator, very humorous, very talented, brought all the students and their parents immediately into his talk, had them laughing and enjoying themselves and complimenting them as he should have on their great accomplishments.
[time=3107] But when he was done he had left them with just enough of the truth of God to make them feel as though they needed no more but for sure of what they needed to get saved.
[time=3118] He left out just the critical points of turning to Christ and repenting of sin and coming to a personal knowledge of Christ.
[time=3125] And so they all got up and left with the very real feeling that they were safe and had known further need for God.
[time=3135] I remember leaving that day thinking God must be very upset with that man.
[time=3142] And when I flick through the television and I see the religious channels and I see these people in our day and age doing the same and I look at the vast religious systems of the world and the billions of people that are being led to slaughter.
[time=3156] I believe that God is very angry and this is their end.
[time=3160] This is his view of them and this is how he will deal with them, that whole system will come to a collapse under the ferocious teeth of the beast who will do away with it and set up his own and they will be heard of no more.
[time=3178] You know Christ said, "I am the way, the truth and the life." And then he said, "No man comes unto the Father but by me." Nobody comes unto the Father but through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3205] And as difficult as that is for some people to believe, it's true.
[time=3210] Jesus said in the sermon he was giving, and you don't need to turn there, but back to Matthew chapter 7, he said this.
[time=3217] He said to the people, "Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction and many are those who enter by it."
[time=3228] There is a broad gate and a broad road called the false religious systems of the world and most of the people who have ever lived will walk in that gate and down that path and it leads to destruction.
[time=3240] And then he went on to say this, "For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life and few are those who find it."
[time=3251] And the gate and the path are one, they are Christ. And you come to God repenting of your sins, finding forgiveness in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, or you don't come to God.
[time=3266] It's a sobering reality, isn't it?
[time=3269] It causes us all the more to feel the responsibility to go into all the nations, all the peoples, all the tribes and tell them that they are duped, that they are in a drunken stupor, having drunk from the wine of immorality of the false harlot, the false God of Babylon.
[time=3288] Let's pray together.
[time=3295] Father, we find ourselves in the minority, even as Christ said we would be, but we find a heart within us for the majority, our hearts break for the people of the world.
[time=3308] We're thankful for some 50 missionaries that were able to support from this church and for Dick Kelly and Bill Colb and Mark Archer who have recently just returned from Russia with a whole new vision for us about how we can strategically impact people for the cause of Christ in the former Soviet Union.
[time=3326] We're thankful to know they are encouraged that there are vast multitudes of people there who are hungry for the gospel and the question will be how can we marshal the resources to meet the needs and to distribute the word of God and build churches and train leaders.
[time=3343] When we see how fortunate we are to know Christ that we are not in some drunken stupor with some false religious system, we find in our hearts a tremendous desire to reach the lost with the cause of Christ.
[time=3356] They give us the grace, give us the commitment and the willingness to sacrifice and the eternal perspective that would allow us to reach out and touch these people in tangible ways and not just around the world but in our own city.
[time=3370] The people we go to work with, the people we live on that street with in a drunken stupor with the false gods of this world.
[time=3381] We pray you'd open their eyes to the blessed message of the truth of Christ.
[time=3385] We love you and we praise you for our salvation. It comes by the grace of God. We don't deserve it. We are no more deserving than the other people of the world but that you have chosen to love us and redeem us and we're thankful.
[time=3396] In Christ's name. Amen.
