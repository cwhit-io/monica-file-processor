[time=0] And it is now this economic system that God is about to judge in Revelation 18.
[time=20] Public enemy number two.
[time=22] If public enemy number one is false religious systems, then public enemy number two throughout the ages of time has been money.
[time=30] And the false autonomy that money gives people.
[time=33] A sense of the fact that they don't need God.
[time=35] And in fact, if you have enough money, you think you are God.
[time=50] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope
[time=56] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=58] Thank you for joining us.
[time=60] God says the love of money is the root of all sorts of evil.
[time=64] Through the ages, Satan has used money and the materialistic system to draw men's hearts away from God.
[time=71] In our study of Revelation today, we see God bringing the whole monetary system of the world to a crashing close.
[time=78] Pastor Moore will be speaking from the book of Revelation chapter 18.
[time=82] Our special music today will be provided by the Brass Ensemble and Brian Loessen.
[time=95] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=112] God, if they visit for a saint, he ever had not served him, but his son, God, their
[time=125] son, God, let them be dressed and be, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing.
[time=139] Thank you.
[time=140] You may be seated.
[time=141] God bless you, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing.
[time=205] , let them sing, let them sing.
[time=222] God bless you, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing
[time=246] and sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing.
[time=260] God bless you, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them
[time=336] , let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them sing, let them
[time=542] I will follow you just the same if it leaves me to the desert where your voice seems far
[time=563] away, I will still believe you love me, I will listen and I will pray, or when the
[time=578] Lord I need to know, your stills all voice, Lord I want to be your servant, oh I don't
[time=604] always know how, but you promised to be with me, and Lord I need you with me now, so
[time=619] let me see you in each moment day by day and week by week, and I will follow you
[time=641] wherever it may be, Lord I will follow you wherever it may be
[time=667] [MUSIC]
[time=692] Thank you Brian, beautifully done, well this morning we are going to go back to the book
[time=700] of Revelation but we were going to get there through the Old Testament and so if you have your Bible come with me to Psalm 73 and we'll start there really as a setting for understanding
[time=714] Revelation chapter 18.
[time=720] One of the things that I so appreciate about the psalmist is their candid openness and
[time=726] vulnerability as they struggle with the issues of life and the man who wrote Psalm 73 was
[time=735] struggling with materialism, he was struggling with a longing in his heart to have the things
[time=742] of the world, and in bearing his soul he takes us through his journey and we'll briefly
[time=750] view it and then find its relevance as we move to Revelation chapter 18, he begins in verse 1, "Surely God is good to Israel to those who are pure in heart, but as for me
[time=763] my feet came close to stumbling, my steps had almost slipped, for I was envious of
[time=771] the arrogant as I saw the prosperity of the wicked." He says here beginning that he's on the brink of spiritual disaster, he's about ready to
[time=782] take a bad fall and his walk with God and he tells us that it's because he's looking
[time=788] within thee at the arrogant and the prosperity, the wealth of the wicked.
[time=794] He describes that in verse 4 and following, "For there are no pains in their death and their body is fat, they are not in trouble as other men nor are they plagued like mankind."
[time=807] And throughout history we could go to any particular point in history, we could even think about the city of Fort Wayne and realize that the people who are wealthy, the people who have the vast amount of wealth in this city in many ways are removed from the trouble
[time=822] of this city, their money allows them to drive big expensive cars and live in big homes and
[time=830] have big huge bank accounts and if they want to go out to dinner to ease the stress of the day they do and if they want to travel to a different city to find different weather or different pursuits they can and they are not bound by the hard regimented struggle
[time=846] and fight for life as other people are and we could say that about ourselves as we compare ourselves to the people of the inner city in Fort Wayne and then we could say that as we are the troubled one as we look at people who are wealthier than we are, whatever station at life you're looking at the next station up seems to have it easier because their money enables them to insulate themselves to a greater degree from the typical hardships of life, at least physically.
[time=872] And he's looking at that and he's envious of them.
[time=875] Their body is fat again in verse 4 and their trouble is not as other men and they are not plagued like mankind, they have enough money and enough resources to rise above some of the common essential needs of life.
[time=889] But verse 6, therefore pride is their necklace, the garment of violence covers them, their
[time=895] eye bulges from fatness, the imaginations of their heart run riot, they mock and wickedly speak of oppression and they even in verse 11 mock God and they say how does God know
[time=908] and is their knowledge with the most high?
[time=910] The whole, these are the wicked and always at ease they have increased in wealth.
[time=916] And the psalmist, he can't figure this out.
[time=920] He doesn't know why these wicked people who stand in opposition to God are given the wealth of this world so that they can use their money to make their existence as pleasurable as possible and he wonders what merit there is in his own life having followed God.
[time=936] Verse 13 and 14, he explains that, "Surely, in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed
[time=942] my hands and innocence, for I have been stricken all day long and chastened every morning."
[time=948] He says, "What's the point?
[time=950] I seek God, I'm holy, I'm righteous, I'm respectable which would all be a part of a
[time=956] pure heart, a pure heart lives a pure life.
[time=961] I've washed my hands and innocence and look at what I get.
[time=964] I'm stricken all day long, I'm chastened every morning, my situation doesn't change.
[time=970] It's as hard today as it was yesterday because I don't have the resources to rise above
[time=976] the common struggle of life." So he says he's struggling.
[time=983] He's about ready to stumble and fall.
[time=988] Verse 16, "When I pondered to understand this, it was troublesome in my sight."
[time=995] Until verse 17, "I came into the sanctuary of God.
[time=1001] Then I perceived their end.
[time=1003] Surely thou dost set them in a slippery place.
[time=1007] Thou dost cast them down to destruction how they are destroyed in a moment.
[time=1012] They are utterly swept away by sudden terrors.
[time=1017] They encouraged this man to stay faithful to God and to continue to walk obediently in the path of righteousness, was coming into the sanctuary of God and perceiving their end and looking past the thin veneer and the facade of their security to find that in the eyes of God and in light of eternity they are standing in a very slippery place.
[time=1037] They are on their way to destruction and they will be destroyed in a moment and be utterly swept away to be seen no more." And so he says in verse 25, "Having gathered these thoughts and come to his senses," he says, "Whom have I in heaven but thee?
[time=1055] And besides thee I desire nothing on earth." He's saying, "The great glory and the wonder and the possession of heaven isn't the pearly gates or the streets of gold or a little harp and some wings.
[time=1066] The awesome wonder of heaven is that in heaven you are mine, God, I have you.
[time=1072] I will be in your presence.
[time=1073] I will know all about you.
[time=1075] You will fill me with your glory." And it is eternal, verse 26, "My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever." The contrast seems obvious.
[time=1088] The wealth of these wicked is temporary.
[time=1091] They will not take it with them to the grave.
[time=1094] Once life is over so is their enjoyment of its wealth and its pleasure, but what I have is better than wealth and is God and He is forever.
[time=1104] And then verse 28, "But as for me, the nearness of God is my good.
[time=1112] I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of all thy works."
[time=1118] I like that.
[time=1120] He views God now as a refuge.
[time=1123] He doesn't say, "Okay, now, great.
[time=1125] It doesn't matter to me anymore that they have money and that I don't." It does, but now that I have it in perspective, I can see the true meaning of life, but I still have to live here and I still have to be without the money that can make my life easy.
[time=1138] So I'll find in my God the refuge.
[time=1140] I'll hide in Him.
[time=1141] He will be my strength and my objective at the end of the psalm, verse 28, that I may
[time=1147] tell of all thy works.
[time=1148] I exist as a mouthpiece of God and I'll live and find in Him the refuge for my soul that
[time=1155] I might stay faithful and then still be able to tell others about Him.
[time=1160] Well, with that as a beginning, would you come then to Revelation chapter 18?
[time=1168] In Revelation chapter 18, we see not the end of certain individuals, as the psalmist
[time=1174] did in Psalm 73, those who lived in His city, we see the end of an entire economic system.
[time=1181] We see the culmination and the final judgment of a system that God calls economic Babylon
[time=1190] and so we get to see the end not just of a few individuals' lives, but the end of an entire system in dynasty called materialism.
[time=1200] Remember now we're studying the book of Revelation and we have come into a period of time called the Tribulation.
[time=1205] It's a seven-year period.
[time=1208] And we have studied through the seven seals which are the judgments that come at the beginning of the Tribulation and then the seven trumpets which are the judgments which come really at the midpoint of the Tribulation and we've also studied in Revelation 16, the seven-ball
[time=1223] judgments which are rapid fire, more intense than any of the preceding ones, and come really
[time=1229] and bring us right up to the edge of Armageddon when Christ will finally come again to this earth.
[time=1234] And we have found that the book of Revelation has written a little bit like a newspaper article in that John has captured some of the salient points up front, the high interest attention grabbers in these three series of seven judgments.
[time=1249] And instead of ending in chapter 16 with the end of the bold judgments and coming right to Armageddon which doesn't come until Revelation 19, he backs up in time and gives us a few details.
[time=1262] And I call Revelation 17 and 18 God's destruction of his public enemies number one and number
[time=1268] two.
[time=1270] Public enemy number one of God throughout all of time, humanly speaking, has been false religion.
[time=1276] And you remember Revelation 17 is the destruction of the false religious system which he calls a harlot or a whore or a prostitute.
[time=1284] He views the false church, the false religious systems of the world as a harlot because they
[time=1290] have enticed the people of this world to be a vital, intimate, union relationship with
[time=1297] a false religious system rather than with God himself.
[time=1301] He says you commit acts of immorality and you are drunk with the wine of your immorality and God delights in the destruction of this false religious system because for millennia
[time=1312] false prophets have stood up and in the name of Christ and in the name of heaven and in the name of religion have led people down the broad road to the ultimate destruction
[time=1322] of hell and so false religious systems is public enemy number one and God destroys them in verse 16 of chapter 17 when the beast turns upon this harlot and will make her desolate
[time=1335] and naked, will eat her flesh and will burn her up with fire.
[time=1340] And when he is finished with that there will be no more false church.
[time=1344] There will never again be on planet earth a false apostate religious system under the
[time=1351] guise of a church.
[time=1352] It's over.
[time=1353] It's done.
[time=1355] That is the end of the false religious system.
[time=1358] In chapter 18 the chapter we have this morning we find public enemy number two, not false
[time=1365] religious system but the love of money, the love of money, the pursuit of material possessions
[time=1372] and while religion has been the opium of the people throughout the years to give them
[time=1378] a sense of false security to numb them to the gnawing presence of guilt for their sin
[time=1384] and their need to repent money and materialism has given them a false sense of autonomy to
[time=1390] say they don't need God to exist.
[time=1393] They have enough money to exist exactly like they want to exist without being dependent upon him and so these two great enemies of God throughout the ages are brought down
[time=1404] in final destruction and my hope for you this morning is that as you live in this day and
[time=1413] this age as I do where songs are written about materialism and where it is flaunted and lifted
[time=1419] up and where we enjoy a higher level of standard of living than any group of people have ever enjoyed in the history of the human race and we are constantly exposed to the voices which
[time=1429] call us to define ourselves and our existence and the meaning of our life and our purpose
[time=1435] by our pursuit and acquisition of material things.
[time=1440] My hope for us this morning that as we are tempted to stray from absolute fidelity in our hearts to God seeing the end of this materialistic system here in Revelation 18 will do for
[time=1452] us what it did for the psalmist in Psalm 73.
[time=1456] And we will emerge from this place with a new sense of the phrase whom have I in heaven
[time=1463] but thee and on earth I desire nothing but thee.
[time=1467] And we will be content to find in God a great refuge as we live faithfully for his glory.
[time=1476] Babylon as you will learn about it in this chapter will both be a system and a city.
[time=1481] An economic system and it will be having a capital called Babylon a city and that we're used to that.
[time=1487] Washington is both of those.
[time=1488] Washington DC to us is both a city it's a physical place and it is a system of policies and thought and an administration.
[time=1496] And so the word Babylon will be used in this chapter.
[time=1500] The chapter breaks in three points and we'll study it under these headings.
[time=1503] Number one the description of her judgment the judgment of Babylon the judgment of this false religious system.
[time=1509] Number two the response to her judgment and then thirdly the finality of her judgment.
[time=1515] So the description the response and the finality of the false economic system of the world.
[time=1522] Let's begin in chapter 18 verse 1.
[time=1525] After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven having great authority and the earth was illumined with his glory and he cried out with a mighty voice saying fallen.
[time=1536] One is Babylon the great and she has become a dwelling place of demons in a prison of every unclean spirit and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird.
[time=1546] For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her immorality and the kings of the earth have committed acts of immorality with her and now the emphasis on materialism begins to come out.
[time=1557] And the merchants of the earth have become rich by the wealth of her sensuality.
[time=1564] Find the merchants again in verse 11 and the merchants of the earth weep and mourn over
[time=1570] her because no one buys their cargo any more.
[time=1574] They are found again only this time called shipmasters in verse 17 for in one hour such great wealth has been laid waste and every shipmaster and every passenger in sailor and
[time=1585] as many as make their living by the sea stood at a distance.
[time=1589] Chapter 17 is the destruction of the false religious system called Babylon and now the Babylon in chapter 18 is the false economic political systems of power and wealth in the world that have opposed the purposes of God since the beginning of time.
[time=1607] Her judgment begins or the description of it in verse 4 and I heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people namely tribulation saints that you may not participate
[time=1620] in her sins that you may not receive of her plagues for her sins have piled up as high as heaven and God has remembered her iniquities.
[time=1631] This is wonderful illustration of how God treats sin people who are stealing and cheating
[time=1637] and lying to gain wealth people who are oppressing other people taking advantage of them to gain
[time=1643] wealth think that because they are not caught by the political system in which they live because they are not prosecuted criminally for their acts that they have escaped judgment that they have done it in secret and gotten away with it.
[time=1656] And God says to them in verse 5 your sins have piled up as high as heaven and God has
[time=1662] remembered your iniquities.
[time=1665] Remember last week we said that this Babylonian system finds its first roots back at the tower of Babel?
[time=1672] The Greek word here for your sins have quote unquote piled up is the Greek word for laying bricks one upon another and while these people think they have escaped the notice of their
[time=1683] contemporaries and have escaped the criminal pursuit for their criminal actions lusting for material things and taking advantage of people.
[time=1691] God says your sins have made for you a new tower of Babel and this one actually does reach to heaven your sins are like a new brick each time you are cruel and oppressive and
[time=1702] greedy and selfish and materialistic you place another brick another piece of mortar upon the tower of Babel that eventually finds its way to heaven.
[time=1711] Your sins are not forgotten you have built a monument to your sins they are obvious they are open and they are exposed.
[time=1718] It's a wonderful concept to trace in scripture that God never forgets the sins of people.
[time=1724] He said to Cain about his murder of Abel the voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground sin is personified as a loud voice and it cries out up into heaven
[time=1736] and finally reaches the years of God in Genesis chapter 18 the outcry it says there of Sodom
[time=1744] and Gomorrah was so odious and shameful in the ears of God as it reached the annals of heaven that he said go down and see if they have really done all this stuff.
[time=1755] Their sin is not forgotten their sin is not overlooked it is a blaring irritating noise in the ears of God.
[time=1764] Ezra 9 6 has another picture of how sin is remembered Ezra confesses his sin in the sin of his people the nation of Israel oh my God I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to thee for our iniquities have risen above our heads and our guilt has grown
[time=1780] even to the heavens and here rather than a voice crying out or bricks building a monument
[time=1787] Ezra draws the picture of flood waters and every time they sin the waters rise a little more and rise a little more and rise a little more until finally it goes over their heads and they drown in their own sin but it goes on beyond that until the flood waters reach the baseboards of heaven and God says what's all this sin what's all this how why is the
[time=1808] tide rising like this he doesn't forget our sin Jeremiah spoke of the historical Babylon
[time=1816] by saying her judgment has reached to heaven and towers up to the very skies like Pinocchio
[time=1825] whose nose grew longer with each lie so the sins of humanity build monuments of brick before
[time=1833] the eyes of God stream louder and louder in intensity as their sin grows and like flood
[time=1839] waters their sin rises above their heads and eventually laps at the bottom of heaven it
[time=1845] stands as an undeniable irrefutable testimony of their sin and God will judge it he goes
[time=1856] on describing the judgment verses 6 and following pay her back even as she has paid and give
[time=1866] back to her double according to her deeds in the cup which she has mixed mixed twice
[time=1873] as much for her to the degree that she glorified herself and lives sensuously now God determines
[time=1880] sovereignly the level of intensity of the torture and the judgment that he will bring upon them by the way when it says there pay back to her in verse 6 even as she has been paid and give her back double according to her deeds he's talking about an enormous level
[time=1895] of judgment and it's as if now her sin is crying out or building bricks or a rising level of water it's a cup that she holds in her hand and she has her immorality right there inside of it and it's mixed to a certain concentrator strength and God measured is it and says
[time=1910] now give her double give her twice as much wrath and judgment as she has mixed for herself
[time=1919] it's a clear picture that the fallen human race participates in the level of judgment
[time=1925] that it will receive from God by the heinousness of its own sin two times as strong and then
[time=1934] verses 7 the middle of verse 7 and following to the same degree give her torment which is to bring wrath by torture this is not a restorative judgment this is not a re-abilitating judgment
[time=1944] this is not anything to help these people in any way shape or form this is simple pure unmitigated torture in the wrath of God give her torment and mourning for she says in her heart I sit as a queen and I am not a widow and will never see mourning there again the
[time=1961] autonomous spirit of wealth she sits like a queen and says I will never I will never
[time=1969] see mourning for this reason in verse 8 in one day her plagues will come pestilence and
[time=1977] mourning and famine and she will be burned up with fire for the Lord God who judges her
[time=1983] is strong thinking back to the historical Babylon for a moment they were under Nebuchadnezzar's
[time=1990] reign the world empire at that time they know they ruled all the known world no one could
[time=1997] contest their power he became so proud and haughty with his own accomplishments that he boasted that he had done it on his own and without the help of God and God sent him into a field for seven years to eat and act like an animal he finally came back and confessed his humility before God his one of his successors bell shazar the later king of Babylon was
[time=2017] having a huge feast they were celebrating their autonomy their independence the fact that they would never fall the great Babylonian kingdom would never be brought to its knees and outside the city walls was the army of Persia and while they waited and during this
[time=2033] great banquet in the very banquet hall in which bell shazar was eating and drinking in this massive festival God allowed a huge hand to appear inside the banquet room and
[time=2046] right upon the wall Mine Mine tickle your farson which means God has numbered your kingdom
[time=2052] and put an into it fear filled their hearts and the Persian army over random that very
[time=2059] night and by morning bell shazar's body was dead and in the streets why because God is
[time=2070] strong God reaches a point of satiation he will not allow wrath to go unanswered in
[time=2078] each generation and eventually cataclysmically at the end of the age and that is what we see here so the description of this judgment God brings judgment upon this final form of
[time=2090] this worldwide economic political system he says your sins to the centuries have piled up like bricks I'm going to give you double payment for your sin and I detest and loathe
[time=2101] your your proud independent heart so I will bring fast swift and complete judgment upon
[time=2107] you secondly let's look at the response to this judgment the judgment itself a detailed
[time=2116] description of it is skipped because actually you've already read it in chapter 16 this judgment I believe is described by the seven bowls so he goes instead to tell us about the response of the people living on the earth to this judgment and he has several categories of response the first are the kings up in verse 9 those who are ruling in that day and
[time=2137] the kings of the earth who committed acts of immorality and lives sensuously with her will weep and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning standing at a distance
[time=2147] because of the fear of her torment saying whoa whoa the great city babble on the strong
[time=2154] city for in one hour your judgment has come the words weep and lament up in verse 9 are
[time=2164] funeral words there are words used with people who are attending a funeral because loss of
[time=2170] a loved one it's that hopeless gut wrenching sense of loss that there's no one who can
[time=2176] ever replace this person in my life and this person has become everything to me and I've lived for this person and given my life sacrificially for this person and now they've been snatched away from me prematurely they're lost to me and I can never get them back and so the words are to weep and to mourn and you say what are they doing in this passage let me
[time=2197] tell you something my friends these kings will weep and lament the loss of their material wealth for this has been their lover they have given themselves completely as completely
[time=2207] as we ought to espouse to their wealth and to their accumulation of wealth and to this materialistic economic system and when it dies and when it is no more they will weep and lament as if they have lost their wife or their husband or their child for to them
[time=2223] this materialistic system is more important to them it is aptly said of them that they
[time=2229] weep and mourn as if to have lost a loved one and they can't believe their eyes in
[time=2237] verse 10 it's just been an hour's time what we spent our life building what we had given
[time=2244] ourselves sacrificially to it was supposed to be stable it was supposed to be strong it was supposed to be the the greatest economic system in the history of the world and we found all of our security in it and now in just a brief hour it's gone they can't believe
[time=2260] their eyes it's reminiscent of Proverbs 23 isn't it the word of God says this do not
[time=2267] wear yourself to gain wealth cease from your consideration of it when you set your eyes
[time=2273] on it it's gone for wealth certainly makes itself wings like the wings of an eagle that
[time=2281] flies toward the heavens they'd sacrificed they'd made commitments they brought their
[time=2289] talents and gifts to bear they'd amassed a huge fortune but as soon as they got it and as soon as they completely fix their heart upon it it seems to have sprouted wings and taken off and they cannot retrieve it it's gone well there's a second group of mourners
[time=2306] they're found in verse 11 they are the merchants not the kings not the ones who run the political system but those who work under the protective environment of that political system they are the ones who make all the money verse 11 and the merchants of the earth weep again
[time=2320] and mourn over her because no one buys their cargos anymore these are the consummate middlemen
[time=2327] these are the ones who have someone else manufactured and someone else buy it and they are the merchants that get it from point A to point B they give their markup and make their millions
[time=2337] but suddenly there's no market suddenly nobody wants to buy it anymore and as the tribulation
[time=2344] progresses they soon have nothing to sell look at it verse 12 cargos of gold and silver
[time=2352] and precious stones and pearls he's going to list now all the signs of opulence in any given society so the first list is the precious metals of gold silver stones and pearls and then the fine fabrics for clothing fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and then the
[time=2368] building materials out of which they make their homes and their furniture citron wood and every article of ivory and every article made from very costly wood and bronze and iron and marble you can imagine the marvelous estates they were building with this costly material and then their perfumes in verse 13 the cinnamon and spice and incense and perfume
[time=2388] and frankincense to make sure everybody smelled good and that all the fabrics were properly scented and then they had to eat and so they got the best money could buy verse 13 wine
[time=2399] and olive oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep and they needed transportation
[time=2405] so they brought in cargos of horses and chariots and then the ultimate sign of opulence and
[time=2412] commitment to self slaves and human lives willing to treat another human life as a consumable
[time=2420] item they had it all they really had a system going they had reached the pinnacle of what
[time=2427] this world could offer them but God judged it verse 14 in the fruit you long for has
[time=2434] gone from you and all things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you then
[time=2441] men will no longer find them they're gone the merchants of these things who became rich
[time=2447] from her will stand at a distance because of the fear of her torment weeping and mourning
[time=2454] saying whoa whoa the great city she who was clothed and fine linen and purple and scarlet
[time=2460] adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls again the phrase for in one hour such
[time=2468] great wealth has been laid waste it wasn't supposed to happen this way we were supposed
[time=2474] to live the rest of our days with all of our wealth and we were supposed to hand it down to our grandchildren and to their children and we were supposed to live securely in this marvelous economic system we had the world by the throat we had everything that money could buy and the promise of all the money we could possibly use but now it's gone a
[time=2497] third group of mourners kind of working our way down in the societal levels verse 17 and
[time=2503] every shipmaster and every passenger and sailor and as many as make their living by the sea
[time=2510] stood at a distance and were crying out as they saw the smoke of the burning saying what
[time=2516] city is like the great city and they threw dust on their heads and were crying out weeping
[time=2522] and mourning and saying just about now you're getting excited oh dust on their heads that's kind of an Old Testament sign of repentance maybe they're really going to turn to God but listen to their lament 19 whoa whoa the great city in which all who had ships had
[time=2538] sea became rich by her well there it is again for in one hour she has been laid waste it's
[time=2548] gone everything I lived for everything I committed myself to everything I put my trust
[time=2554] in it's gone it amazes me they won't repent come back to Revelation 16 for a minute and
[time=2567] see the judgment that produces this catastrophe of their economic system we've looked at this already in detail but I just want to remind you of a few things that are especially relevant chapter 16 verse 2 the first angel pours out his bowl into the earth and it became
[time=2582] loathsome and malignant the sores were upon men who had the mark of the beast and then worship the image in other words in order to get into that economic system folks you had to have the mark of the beast no mark no trade no mark no sale no mark nobody talks to you so everybody we're reading about in Revelation 18 has got this mark on them where they can't do business they can't be merchants they can't be shipmasters they can't be sailors they can't be making their life through the trading of merchandise let me tell you what when these sores hit them it no longer is very important to them to have fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and costly wood and marble and cinnamon and frankincense and cattle and sheep it's meaningless they are consumed with their own physical pain and frankly they don't care if they have any of that stuff all the money in the world can alleviate their pain so God then pours out in this second bowl into the sea verse 3
[time=2632] and the sea became like blood that of a dead man thick dark rank sludge and every living
[time=2641] thing in the sea died so now all the creatures who live there are now floating upon the top of the ocean in one stinking mass with disease the ship trade instantly dies it can't make
[time=2653] its way from one side of the ocean to the next and then this third bowl verse 4 angel
[time=2661] poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of waters and they became blood once again it doesn't much matter how much money you're worth at the moment of your greatest
[time=2671] thirst when all you can think about is a is a drink of cool water but you can't find one you can't buy one all the money in the world will do nothing for you because there isn't any fresh water anymore and to make matters worse in verse 8 God brings the fourth bowl and the sun is turned up in its intensity and it scorches everybody with heat it doesn't
[time=2693] matter how much money you have but look here's where we're headed verse 9 there were scorched with fierce heat and they blasphemed the name of God they knew it was God there was no confusion there was no lack of knowledge they hated him for it he was destroying their great Babylon
[time=2709] so they blasphemed his name who had the power over these plagues and then it is they did not repent so he puts them in solitary confinement in the darkness where they can think about their physical
[time=2720] sores and their lack of food from the sea and their lack of water and their scorching sunburns
[time=2726] so he puts them in the in the solitude of blackness verse 10 the kingdom became darkened and they
[time=2732] gnawed their tongues because of their pain but that wouldn't help they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores and they refused to repent of their deeds well now we know who those people were and now we know they're lament
[time=2748] back to Revelation 18 these people during this great tribulation are not stoic in their emotions
[time=2754] they're not without crying they're not without their own sense of physical and emotional pain they're weeping they're mourning they're lamenting but are they lamenting their sin are they mourning their wasted life on material things which can be snatched from them in less than an hour no they just lament the loss of all they knew they refuse to turn to God they blaspheme
[time=2775] him and they go to hell with unrepentant hearts it's a sad state of affairs
[time=2786] remember God said the Lord said in Matthew that you cannot serve two masters you will either serve God or you will serve money and when money wraps its tentacles around your heart
[time=2799] and your mind and your eyes and your capacity to see spiritually you come to the place where you
[time=2805] are utterly spiritually blind and though the entire world is falling apart all around you
[time=2813] you cannot see it for what it is and so instead of repenting before God you curse him for what he
[time=2819] has done you want nothing to do with him it says in Matthew for where your treasure is there will
[time=2827] your heart be also the lamp of the body is the eye that's how we see and perceive and make decisions
[time=2834] by the light that comes into our eye if therefore your eye is clear your whole body will be full of light you'll have all the necessary information to make all the necessary decisions and live successfully but if the eye is bad your whole body will be full of darkness if your eyes are
[time=2851] blind no lightness gets into information is there and you stumble and crash if therefore the light
[time=2857] that is in you is darkness how great is the darkness no one can serve two masters for either he will
[time=2863] hate the one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other you cannot serve God and Mammon how that truth is punctuated by Revelation 18 as these men see the end of it all that will
[time=2876] never return and yet they refuse to repent but look at verse 20 Revelation 18 verse 20
[time=2882] here we find the saints you and me and we are rejoicing over her
[time=2893] O heaven and you saints and apostles and prophets because God has pronounced judgment for you against
[time=2900] her God is saying this is a day of celebration for the saint this is a day when all of your trials and all of your hardship and all of your suffering that has come to you at the hands of the wicked wealthy are vindicated and it's time for you to rejoice and you remember I have sent my apostles
[time=2916] and my prophets throughout all the ages of time to tell the wealthy that their day of judgment is coming and consistent with my promises through old and New Testaments finally the day of judgment
[time=2927] has come for you against her God sees it as a matter of personal vindication for your suffering
[time=2935] and your trial as you have pursued the kingdom of God instead of the kingdom of Satan and his wealth and he vindicates you on that final day and calls you to rejoice in it
[time=2946] well let's look lastly at the finality of her judgment will she ever return will this false
[time=2952] economic system ever come to prominence again in the rest of the thousand years of the earth no verse 21 a strong angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea saying
[time=2966] thus will Babylon the great city be thrown down in violence and will not be found any longer
[time=2973] key phrase will not be found any longer so God gives us kind of a little picture graph here
[time=2980] flannel graph object lesson with this angel who reaches down and picks up this huge stone which represents the city of Babylon goes to the edge of the ocean and hurls it off into the ocean and it sinks and the point is it goes out of sight and soon there isn't even a ripple of the disturbance that it made on its way in and it's too deep and too heavy for anybody to retrieve it so it stays there it's gone and it will never be seen again how do I know that well look at verses 22 and 23
[time=3008] the sound of harpists and musicians and flute players and trumpeters here's that phrase will
[time=3014] not be heard in you any longer those are the sounds of celebration when wealthy people have a party
[time=3020] they higher up their harpists and their musicians and their flute players and their trumpeters they make merry they use that music to try to dull their own sense of emptiness and they they celebrate
[time=3030] but stopped no more of that also in verse 22 the craftsmen of any craft will be found in you any
[time=3039] longer there will be no more craftsmen they won't be making the marble into beautiful countertops and the wood into beautiful chairs and high vaulted ceilings and chandeliers and all the rest that these talented men would do their their their noises no more their craft is no more it's over
[time=3057] and then it says in verse 22 and the sound of a mill will not be heard in you any longer this is speaking of the food source producing that fine wheat into marvelous breads and delicious
[time=3068] appetizing meals that's all gone no more of that verse 23 and the light of a lamp will not shine
[time=3077] in you any longer and the voice of the bridegroom and the bride will not be heard in you any longer that is the pinnacle of celebration of any society when two people decide to get married and the mom and the dad on each side and they throw this huge extravagant lavish party to celebrate the
[time=3091] union of the bridegroom and the bride one of society's highest privileges to have the money
[time=3098] and wear with all to celebrate this new union but that won't be heard anymore nobody will have
[time=3104] the money to throw weddings anymore everybody's broke the whole economic system is gone they won't
[time=3110] be able to find the wedding dress or the wedding cake or the the bridesmaid's dresses or the flowers
[time=3116] it's all burnt up and shriveled and gone for your merchants in verse 23 were the great men of the
[time=3124] earth because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery speaking of Babylon and her ability to
[time=3130] woo people into this false materialistic system they gave their life their heart and their soul
[time=3139] to something that was destroyed in a moment look what else they did verse 24 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints
[time=3152] and of all who have been slain on the earth so six times in those few verses the phrase not
[time=3160] any longer shows up and that in conjunction with the picture of this great millstone being thrown into the ocean God is saying that when my son Jesus Christ comes back and reigns for a thousand years in the millennial kingdom this system will not be in place and it will never show up again
[time=3176] it's over and all the sights and sounds of your opulence are gone your city is quiet
[time=3184] and all that characterizes your wealthy way of life is over and the very silence of the city is a
[time=3190] testimony of God's judgment upon this materialistic system so you see here the final hour
[time=3199] of what we now live in every day every day we live in this every day we have the tension in our
[time=3206] hearts let me try to balance this as we close there's revelation 18 and the rest of the bible
[time=3214] tell us that it's wrong to make money absolutely not in fact if you fail to provide for your
[time=3220] family you're worse than a heretic there's revelation 18 tell us that it's wrong to be successful at what we do absolutely not in fact many Christians because they're Christians and
[time=3231] they're hard working and they're faithful and they're honest do better than most for those very virtues and they are rewarded by this world system sometimes lavishly with huge incomes and they
[time=3242] amass large amounts of money does revelation 18 and the rest of the bible tell us that it's
[time=3249] wrong to be rich absolutely not Abraham was one of the wealthiest men in the Old Testament Job you can read the listing of his multi-million dollar estate the bible nowhere condemns that
[time=3260] David was fabulously wealthy Solomon was fabulously wealthy the bible nowhere says that were to take
[time=3267] vows of poverty on the other hand is it wrong to set your heart on riches you bet is it wrong to
[time=3276] fundamentally say what makes me what I am is my ability to earn money and save money and build
[time=3282] capital and when I think about the real me and when I think about what makes me worthy or unworthy
[time=3288] I define that in terms of my net worth and my success in this world system yeah there's something
[time=3294] horribly wrong with that horribly wrong with that what does a man have that he has not received
[time=3302] if you have success and if you have material wealth it is a gift of god and steward it as such
[time=3308] but don't make the horrible mistake of defining who you are by it define yourself instead by your character and your commitment to the kingdom of god
[time=3320] your love of your wife and your kids and your church the dedication of what you are to be the
[time=3327] person that you ought to be not by the absence or the presence of wealth the thought is the thought
[time=3333] is foreign to the New Testament I wish I had time this morning to read to you all of Luke chapter 12
[time=3341] but let me just take a few excerpts you don't need to turn there listen instead beware and be on your guard against every form of greed for not even when one has an abundance does
[time=3355] his life consist of his possessions and do not seek what you shall eat and what you shall drink
[time=3366] and do not keep worrying for all these things the nations of the world eagerly seek but your
[time=3373] father knows that you need these things seek for his kingdom and these things shall be added
[time=3384] unto you do not be afraid little flock for your father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom
[time=3395] the real kingdom the one that comes in chapter 19 of Revelation sell your possessions and give
[time=3401] to charity make yourselves pursuers which purses which do not wear out an unfailing treasure in
[time=3409] heaven where no thief comes near nor moth destroys for where your treasure is there will your heart
