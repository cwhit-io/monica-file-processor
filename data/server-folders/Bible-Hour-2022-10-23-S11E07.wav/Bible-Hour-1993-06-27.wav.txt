[time=0] The five main events of history all center around the person of Christ.
[time=18] They are His birth, His crucifixion, His resurrection, His ascension, and fifthly His
[time=25] second coming.
[time=38] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=44] Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] The first time that Christ came to the earth, He came without being noticed or recognized by the vast majority of people on the planet.
[time=56] When Christ comes again, every person alive will see Him coming and will instantly feel the impact of His arrival.
[time=63] For those who love Him, His second coming will be a time of great rejoicing.
[time=66] For those who oppose Him, it will be a time of terrible judgment.
[time=70] If you were to come back today, what kind of a time would it be for you?
[time=74] Master Moore will be speaking from the book of Revelation chapter 19 in a message He's entitled, "The Second Coming of Christ." Our special music today will be provided by Kevin Rowe and Denise Mitchell and Celebration.
[time=94] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=111] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=280] [APPLAUSE]
[time=300] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=530] Well good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour. We're glad you've tuned in this morning and trust that God will encourage your heart through the time that we spend together. I'm excited about this morning, July 4th. We've got a special opportunity that a group is coming to our sanctuary to sing. They're from Moscow. They're called the Baptist Moscow singers. Russians who love God and who are on tour inside the United States under the direction of Sindh International. And they've scheduled us for this Sunday.
[time=559] July 4th and our services start at 9.15 and 10.50. So you could actually come today and hear these people sing. They have marvelous voices and sing with the full range of harmony that we know and love in the Russian style of music. And with them is Dr. Bob Provost, a good friend of mine from years ago at the Masters College.
[time=581] And Bob Provost is now the point man for Sindh International in Russia and the Ukraine and many other countries in that area. And he's going to give us an update on what God is doing in the people and the hearts of the people of Russia.
[time=597] And I know it's going to be exciting and I want to encourage you to come. I think your heart will be thrilled. So working around your other church service, if you happen to have that, or just come by and let us encourage you with music.
[time=608] What a great way to celebrate the independence of the United States of America by looking above and beyond our own country to what God is doing in nations all around the world. So join us even this morning at 9.15 and at 10.50 today, July 4th.
[time=625] Also, I want you to know we're giving a special offer through the summer here. These Bible character cards on the front is a picture of a Bible character and then on the back some information about his life.
[time=636] And then also it covers a Bible verse that can be memorized and questions. It's a tremendous opportunity to spend time with your children or your grandchildren through the summer.
[time=644] If you'd like us to send you some Bible character cards, write us at the Bible Hour. That's the Bible Hour 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=656] The street address is 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. We'd love to send you some of those and give you an opportunity to spend some time with your kids around the Word of God.
[time=670] Well, again, I trust that God is doing great things in your life, that he's encouraging you through your study of the Word of God and through Christian friends.
[time=678] And we're thankful for your partnership with us here in the Bible Hour and trust that God will encourage your heart.
[time=684] At this time, we'll go back to the regular scheduled portion of our service. And God bless you.
[time=700] [MUSIC] First I want to thank you Lord for being who you are [MUSIC] Coming to the rescue of a man who's drifted far [MUSIC] For calling me to be your son and calling me to serve [MUSIC] Lord, the way you blessed my life is more than I deserve [MUSIC] Keep the ones I love so dearly [MUSIC] Fill their emptiness while I am gone [MUSIC] And fill the loneliness in me [MUSIC] This is my prayer lifted to you [MUSIC] Knowing you care even more than I do [MUSIC] This is my prayer lifted in your name [MUSIC] Your will be gone I humbly pray [MUSIC] Let me be the evidence what your grace can do [MUSIC] To a generation struggling to find themselves in you [MUSIC] May they come to all the love of God [MUSIC] May their lives be made to sing [MUSIC] Give me the opportunity to share the truth [MUSIC] That's sense then free [MUSIC] And may unity in all kings [MUSIC] Be the banner of your church [MUSIC] And let revival's fire begin to burn [MUSIC] This is my prayer lifted to you [MUSIC] Knowing you care even more than I do [MUSIC] This is my prayer lifted in your name [MUSIC] Your will be done I humbly pray [MUSIC] As we face the last and final hours [MUSIC] To a generation struggling to know [MUSIC] Leave us from the evil that devours [MUSIC] Leave us on the path that lead us to [MUSIC] Keep us in your light until your kingdom comes [MUSIC] And our work is done [MUSIC] This is my prayer lifted to you [MUSIC] Knowing you care so much more than I do [MUSIC] This is my prayer lifted to you [MUSIC] Your will be done I humbly pray [MUSIC] I pray [MUSIC] This is my prayer [MUSIC] This is my prayer â™ª
[time=940] [APPLAUSE]
[time=954] Thank you. Beautiful music here at Blackhawk.
[time=958] We are so blessed.
[time=960] Well, let me invite you this morning to take your Bible and come to Revelation chapter 19.
[time=967] As we continue in our study of this wonderful book, the last book of the Bible, as it challenges our understanding of the world and of things as we see them now in light of how they will ultimately end up.
[time=980] And begin with a question this morning.
[time=982] If you were to be asked by me to identify the five most significant events in world history,
[time=993] which five do you think you'd come up with?
[time=996] And you can include, through the end of the book of Revelation, the five most significant events in the history of the world.
[time=1004] And I kind of carried that question with me in my mind as I had opportunity to be in California again this week.
[time=1010] I was speaking at a conference for young people.
[time=1014] Students, about a hundred of them who have juniors, soon to be seniors, been elected the positions of student body president in their high schools in Central California.
[time=1022] And they had asked me to come and speak to them on leadership, and I enjoyed that very much.
[time=1026] But flying into LAX, looking out of the window there and seeing the incredibly packed conditions
[time=1032] in which people live in Los Angeles, I think I even saw some of the damage from the riots.
[time=1038] I began to ask myself the question, what are these people about?
[time=1041] Do they know why they're on the planet?
[time=1044] Do they have a sense of history where it's headed, where it's been, where it's going?
[time=1049] And does that understanding of history guide them or channel them in any way as they live their life?
[time=1057] Landed in the airport and saw the whole menagerie of people that you do when you're in a large airport coming from all over the place, and the question comes in your mind, who are these people?
[time=1065] Where are they from? Do they have families, mothers, fathers? Is it the same?
[time=1069] How does God keep all this straight, keeping in touch with all these people?
[time=1073] Left the airport and drove down Century Boulevard, and there's one of the largest pornography houses
[time=1079] that I've ever seen in my life. I've never been in there, but I thought I'd had that.
[time=1084] I drive by it. There's this huge sign that you can't miss.
[time=1089] It says nude nudes. And then a whole bunch of other words that are there.
[time=1094] And you see people going and coming and cars are in the parking lot, and you think about the people that work there.
[time=1099] And if you were to ask them the question, what are the five most important events in history?
[time=1104] You know, what would they say to you? What would their world view be?
[time=1108] What would be the things that really for them shape up the world as they understand it?
[time=1113] Went from there to the youth camp and spoke to those young people, and it was quite evident that they were not fully in touch
[time=1121] with the five most important events in human history.
[time=1124] And then I had a chance from there to go a little more north in California up to the Monterey Peninsula and went on to that 17-mile drive up in the Carmel Monterey area.
[time=1132] I don't know if you've been on that. But it is some of the most beautiful real estate the world has ever seen, and there are these gargantuan estates, mansions of the roof line, which is about all you get to see of these houses.
[time=1143] They just go on forever and ever and ever, and you think, my lands, who owns these houses?
[time=1148] Where do they get the money to live in these houses?
[time=1151] Somebody told me that the property taxes on some of these estates can be upwards of $300,000 a year.
[time=1158] I thought to myself, that's more than I make here in a month.
[time=1161] You know, that's a lot of money to be paying out for property tax.
[time=1169] And somebody suggested that a lot of the money that is up there is wealth that comes from generation after generation after generation.
[time=1177] I mean, it's so deep. They don't even know how deep the well is, and that kind of money is no problem to them.
[time=1183] So I thought about them. What would they say if I could speak with some of these fabulously wealthy people living in the garden spot on planet Earth?
[time=1192] What would they say are the five most important events in the history of the world?
[time=1200] Well, one of them, in my opinion, one of these five most important events is found in this chapter, Revelation 19.
[time=1208] But to set the stage for it, let me give you what I think would be most people's response to their understanding of history.
[time=1215] What is history? How do they fit? Where is the world going? Where has it come from? What are the issues that really frame up life for them?
[time=1223] The first would probably be the cyclical view of history.
[time=1227] I think a lot of people running around the planet today believe that history just simply repeats itself.
[time=1232] It's just one dynasty comes and another dynasty comes after that and another dynasty comes after that.
[time=1238] And really it's just the same stuff going over and over and over and over again, different names, different people, different places.
[time=1245] Of course, a lot of people believe in reincarnation, so it's sort of different people.
[time=1249] It's kind of the same people coming back to go through this cycle again from a different perspective or a different vantage point.
[time=1256] It just kind of goes over and over and over again. The new age movement obviously has contemporized this Hindu thought and we are reincarnated
[time=1265] and it's the same stuff over and over and over again. And so history really has no meaning at all.
[time=1270] It's not going anywhere and the best you can hope for in history is to get out of history.
[time=1275] And that is referred to as nirvana, which is a place of unaware.
[time=1280] You're not aware that you're in history anymore and you've been transcended above it, but it's not going anywhere.
[time=1286] It's just this endless repetitious cycle of stuff.
[time=1291] Another group would probably answer more along the lines of a linear view to stay with the analogy of history.
[time=1297] That it's not a cycle over and over and over. It's just one long line and these events just occur and they never really repeat themselves.
[time=1303] There may be similarities, but they're totally different events and they just go on and on and on.
[time=1307] And we don't know when the line began, we don't know why the line began, we don't know that anybody began the line called history.
[time=1313] We have no idea where it ends, we have no idea why it will ever end.
[time=1316] It had an accidental beginning, it will probably have an accidental end.
[time=1320] And the most I can hope for in my little slice of the line of history is to have some sense of gratification.
[time=1326] And so I live for life and try to seek all the gusto I can, all the pleasure I can, I cram it full of things that seem to please me.
[time=1335] But for them, history has no God, no rhyme, no reason, no method, no purpose, no creator, no progenitor, and no conclusions.
[time=1343] It is just this long endless accidental existence.
[time=1349] And then there is the distinctly Christian worldview, the one that we will be confronted with in the Word of God today.
[time=1355] And it is this, history is the working of God's purposes in the world as they are explained to us in the Word of God.
[time=1366] Firstly, secondly, everyone is moving toward an appointment with God.
[time=1373] And that appointment will go well or it will go bad depending upon what that person has decided to do with Christ.
[time=1381] In other words, their entire eternal destiny will be determined in that appointment with God based upon one thing.
[time=1388] What did you do with the person of Jesus Christ?
[time=1392] The third part of our distinctly worldview of history and life is that Christ is the main person or the centerpiece of history.
[time=1401] He's it.
[time=1403] And vis-a-vis the five most important events in all of world history, one, his birth, two, his crucifixion, three, his resurrection, four, his ascension, and five when he comes back.
[time=1420] His second coming, the five, in my opinion, the five most important events in the history of the world all center in the most important person of the world, namely the person of Christ.
[time=1433] And it is what you have done with Christ that will determine your eternal destiny before God.
[time=1439] And all of history is orchestrated by the sovereign plan of God to exalt and exonerate the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1447] And that really, as you know, is the book of Revelation.
[time=1450] It is verse one of chapter one.
[time=1453] Let me read it.
[time=1454] The revelation of Jesus Christ.
[time=1457] This whole book is about the person of Christ.
[time=1460] It is about the full disclosure of his person.
[time=1464] And it comes to us kind of like waves upon the ocean.
[time=1470] And some of them are smaller at first as we read about him moving in and through the churches, the seven lampstands.
[time=1477] We find his ministry there to purify and to purge the church.
[time=1481] And then we see, transported up into heaven, God has this marvelous scroll, the title deed to the earth, or the title deed of history.
[time=1489] All that history means, all that history can mean, all that history should mean.
[time=1494] And Christ takes it unto himself and begins to open this little book and out of it comes all this judgment.
[time=1499] And eventually we come to the climactic point that we find here in Revelation chapter 19 verses 11 to 21.
[time=1507] In my opinion, the fifth or one of the five most important events in the history of the world, the second coming of Christ.
[time=1513] Christ comes again.
[time=1516] And we'll look at the coming of Christ or the second coming of Christ under just three simple little titles this morning.
[time=1522] The first will be the return of Christ, the second will be the rule of Christ, and the third, the ravaging of Christ.
[time=1530] Not that Christ gets ravaged, that happened in the first time.
[time=1533] The second time he does the ravaging and we'll see that as we look at this text.
[time=1537] The return of Christ verses 11 and following.
[time=1542] And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems, and he has a name written upon it, which no one knows except himself.
[time=1562] And he has clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.
[time=1567] And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean were following him on white horses.
[time=1577] It opens up with the heavens again, and the heavens themselves are opening up.
[time=1582] And it's obvious that people are going to be looking up into heaven, and we just need to take a moment.
[time=1587] Because I believe God has strategically orchestrated this moment in history to bring a climactic and unavoidable sense that something dramatic and wonderful, and yet if you're on the wrong side of the fence, terrifying has occurred.
[time=1602] Come back with me to Revelation chapter 6 and look at how God has set the scene now for the second coming of Christ.
[time=1609] And we're mindful that in the first coming of Christ nobody gave him the honor that was his due, nobody stopped and paused, the vast majority of the people who lived on the earth didn't even know he'd arrived.
[time=1620] There were a few wise men who noticed, and some shepherds who noticed, but again the vast majority of humanity had no concept and didn't care.
[time=1630] That will not be the case when he comes again, and God makes sure of that, and God has been setting the scene for that through the seven years of the tribulation.
[time=1638] In Corinthians chapter 6 you remember this in verses 12 and following, "I looked, and when he broke the sixth seal there was a great earthquake."
[time=1646] And you remember that wasn't an earthquake, that was a universe quake, it shook the whole universe.
[time=1650] We know that because the impact was encompassing the universe.
[time=1653] The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood, and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree casts its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.
[time=1665] The heavens have become unpredictable, the heavens have become a source of fear, they do great damage to the earth, and so people are becoming very conscious of things that come out of heaven.
[time=1678] It has turned the whole sun black, and the moon is black, and remember these asteroids or these small chunks of stars start falling out of heaven like the figs falling out of an unripe fig tree when it's shaken by a great wind, just all at once, just kaboop.
[time=1695] And then the sky itself in verse 14 is split apart like a scroll when it's rolled up, and every mountain and island is moved out of their place, there's huge massive continental shift going on.
[time=1705] It's so bad that the kings and the great men and the commanders and the rich and the strong and the slave and the free men are hiding themselves among the rocks in the mountains, and they have a death wish on their lips in verse 16 fall on us and hide us from the presence of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.
[time=1721] They want to die. The sky has become so hostile, the heavens have become so dangerous as they, if you will, vomit up their contents and they crash upon the planet earth that people are scurrying into the caves and the clefs of the rocks and not for protection to live, but in hopes that they'll fall and die upon them.
[time=1743] So it's a massive thing. Come to chapter 8. Apparently the sun resumes its strength and the moon turns back to giving its light.
[time=1752] Things resume to somewhat of a normal state of affairs in the heavens because this next set of judgments again distorts the heavens, and so it assumed that it went back to normal for a while.
[time=1763] Chapter 8 verse 7. These are the trumpets. Hail and fire mixed with blood are thrown down to the earth out of heaven and they burn up a third of the trees.
[time=1773] Then the second angel sounds in verse 8 and something like a great mountain burning with fire is thrown into the sea, obviously out of heaven, and a third of the sea becomes blood.
[time=1782] And then verse 10, a third trumpet is sounded and a great star falls from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and the springs and made them unsuitable to drink.
[time=1795] And so the sky is just a terrible thing, verse 12, a third of the sun and the third of the moon and a third of the stars were smitten so that a third of them might be darkened and the day might not shine for a third of it and the night in the same way.
[time=1810] So now again the heavens are not totally but partially darkened or they're darkened for longer periods of time, but the sun eventually shines again.
[time=1821] Now maybe that condition continues, we don't know, but come to chapter 16 and again God sensitizes people to what is coming out of heaven.
[time=1834] And this last one was really the total darkness of all the heavens, chapter 16 verse 10.
[time=1844] Remember the fifth bowl, he pours out his bowl upon the throne of the beast and the kingdom became darkened and they gnawed their tongues because of their pain.
[time=1852] In other words God caused the heavens to go pitch black and in the darkness they couldn't think about anything but their own plagues that they'd received in the first bowls and so they're gnawing now their tongues because of the pain.
[time=1863] But it's pitch black, it's absolutely dark, you can't see a thing.
[time=1868] It's like being in a very, very dark place, you can't even see your own hand, it's just all the light's gone.
[time=1874] Well that however is punctuated by verse 18, flashes of lightning and sounds and peels of thunder.
[time=1881] And you know that these are in the Bible, whenever this stuff shows up with connection to judgment, people don't look at it and go oh it wasn't that a neat strike of lightning.
[time=1890] That was a neat rolling thunder, they just get scared out of their wits.
[time=1895] He turns the volume up on all that stuff and it goes past amusing and amazing and it's just fear inspiring.
[time=1903] And so it's dark and the only time it's not dark is when flashes of lightning and sounds and peels of thunder are crashing through the heavens.
[time=1910] There's an earthquake that they can't really understand in verse 18 because they can't see anything, they have no way to measure it, they have no way to understand its damage.
[time=1917] They could possibly hear things falling around them but they can't look, they can't see, they're blind because it's dark.
[time=1924] In verse 20 the continental shift resumes its progress and the islands are fleeing away and mountains this time are just not to be found because they're crushed under the, you know, the disturbance that the earth is under.
[time=1937] And then to make matters worse, it's dark, you can't see except when the lightning flashes, you know that things are shifting and moving and crashing and falling.
[time=1945] And then verse 21, huge hailstones about a hundred pounds each come crashing down from the heaven upon you.
[time=1951] Not a good place to be, not a good scenario.
[time=1956] Well that is the exact situation when you come that is prevalent in the world when you come to chapter 19 verse 11.
[time=1965] Remember 17 and 18 were kind of a look back at some details in the tribulation so you just jump from that portion of scripture in chapter 16 right into chapter 19 verse 11 and boom.
[time=1978] This time it's not lightning, this time the heaven opens up and out of the darkness, out of the stark contrast of total pitch black comes a white horse.
[time=1988] Now the word white here is lukeon in the Greek and it means brilliant, it has its own energy source, it is like a light bulb, it's shining, it's glowing, it is brilliant in its appearance.
[time=2001] And upon this white horse is he who sat upon it, faithful and true, and in righteousness he judges in wages worn.
[time=2008] Now verse 14, it's not just Christ bursting forth out of the pitch black of the tribulation on a beautiful brilliant white horse, it's the armies which are with him.
[time=2017] And they are clothed in fine linen, white and clean which no doubt is reflecting all of the light that's coming from these horses and they were following him on white horses, same Greek word, same brilliant stuff.
[time=2029] These horses are just shining and glowing and so there is this marvelous spectacle that comes upon the horizon of Christ and his armies and they're all glowing in contrast to the pitch black darkness.
[time=2043] The armies are hard to identify. Our best guess about this is that it would be the church, the bride of Christ, who comes again with Christ at his second coming, but in addition to that the tribulation saints and in addition to that all of the angelic hosts.
[time=2058] So it's not unreasonable to think that there are literally millions and billions of constituents in this army.
[time=2067] And so it's just this hard, this massive group and they're all glowing and shining as they come to earth.
[time=2075] So a great flash of glory that fills the sky. Now I want you to see two other passages about the second coming just to fill your thinking in.
[time=2082] So keep your finger there in Revelation. Come to Matthew 24 for a minute and the Lord himself is describing his own second coming.
[time=2091] And he does it very succinctly, but now that you've studied Revelation you'll know what is in his head as he says these sentences that really contain volumes of judgment and devastation.
[time=2103] Matthew 24 verse 29.
[time=2110] But immediately, excuse me, but immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light and the stars will fall from the sky and the powers of heaven will be shaken.
[time=2123] And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with the power and great glory.
[time=2134] And he will send forth his angels with a great trumpet and they will gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of the sky to the other.
[time=2142] So the Lord knows the way this whole scene sets. The sun is darkened. The moon doesn't give any light. The stars are falling out of the sky.
[time=2150] The heavens are dangerous for boating reality to humanity and they give no light and in the contrast of that darkness comes Christ and his armies.
[time=2160] And he bursts forth onto the scene and every man, look at verse 30, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.
[time=2174] So everybody sees it. Not a few shepherd boys, not a few wise men, not the guy that ran the manger, everybody on the planet because the planet has been appropriately prepared for this great and awesome movement.
[time=2187] This is pretty spectacular. When God wants you to know that his Son is coming, he lets you know. He pulls out all the stops.
[time=2197] Now, back to the Old Testament, Zechariah. If you can't find your way back to Zechariah, go to Matthew and just keep going back, go back to books, Malachi and then Zechariah.
[time=2210] Zechariah chapter 14, here's a dear Old Testament saint who has never read the book of Revelation, who doesn't know a tenth of what you and I know about the coming of the Lord.
[time=2226] But he's inspired and the Spirit of God is working in and through him in the inspiration of the Scripture. And so he communicates what is in his heart.
[time=2237] Zechariah 14, verse 1, "Behold, a day is coming for the Lord, when the spoil taken from you will be divided among you.
[time=2246] For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city will be captured. The houses plundered, the women ravished, and half of the city exiled, but the rest of the people will not be cut off from the city."
[time=2261] This is the great gathering, which we'll see in a minute in Revelation 19, of the kings and the armies of the earth to attack Jerusalem and Christ. And as you can see in verse 2, they gain a measure of success.
[time=2274] They come against Jerusalem, the city is captured, the houses are plundered, the women are ravished, then verse 3.
[time=2284] Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle. And in that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives.
[time=2294] So he identifies for us where he's coming back. Christ will come back to the Mount of Olives. Now you know where he left, right?
[time=2300] That was the fourth great event in the history of the human race when he stood on the Mount of Olives in Acts chapter 1 and ascended up into heaven. He's coming back to the same location.
[time=2311] So his feet in verse 4 will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives will be split in its middle from east to west by a very large valley.
[time=2322] So when he comes and he touches down there, this huge splitting takes place on the Mount of Olives, and it creates a very large valley.
[time=2330] So that half the rest of verse 4, so that half of the mountain will move toward the north and the other half toward the south, and you will flee by the valley of my mountains.
[time=2339] For the valley of the mountains, which will reach to Azell, yes you will flee just as you fled before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah.
[time=2347] Then the Lord my God will come and all the holy ones with him.
[time=2351] So it's depicted here by Zachariah how the Lord will come and his second coming, how he'll touch down on the Mount of Olives,
[time=2359] how it will split and it will be just at the right moment to let the remaining remnant of Jerusalem, the people of God, to escape from their pursuers through this valley,
[time=2369] and how he will bring with him all the holy ones.
[time=2374] Well see, he couldn't see all that we can see, not back to Revelation 19. He didn't know that when he came, he'd be coming out of the darkness on this glowing, beautiful, brilliant white horse,
[time=2387] and that the holy ones would be as numerable as they are, and that they too would be clothed and fine linen, white and clean on their own white horses.
[time=2396] But it's a spectacular presentation, the return of Christ is everything the opposite of his first coming in humility and without publicity.
[time=2406] Now look at verses 12 and 13 and just get a few more of the details about his coming. His eyes are a flame of fire, Revelation 19, 12 and 13,
[time=2415] his eyes are a flame of fire and upon his head are many diadems, and he has a name written upon him which no one knows except himself,
[time=2423] and everybody always says so well okay, what's the name? Then you say well nobody knows except himself, he says it right there in verse 12,
[time=2431] then verse 13 and he is clothed with a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.
[time=2439] We've seen some of these descriptive phrases, his eyes as a flame of fire, they're piercing, they're penetrating, anybody who needs to be judged will be judged, nobody will fool him, nobody will bamboozle him, nobody will pull the wool over his eyes,
[time=2450] nobody will escape his penetrating gaze, if they deserve judgment they'll get it and they'll get exactly what they deserve.
[time=2456] The diadem speak of his reign now in the Millennial Kingdom, he is crowned, he is worthy of such kingship, and then in verse 13 he is clothed with a robe dipped in blood.
[time=2468] Folks this is not the first time that Christ has fought. In the Old Testament in Theophanes he showed up often in defense of his nation,
[time=2475] and apparently he is wearing the same robes now as he was then which accounts for the fact that they are bloodied.
[time=2482] He has come to fight and he has his fighting clothes on.
[time=2489] So it's a tremendous picture, and his name is called the Word of God, who always was and who always will be.
[time=2500] So from there the return, the stage is set by the blackened sky, lightning in the thunder, the earthquakes, the islands are fleeing, the mountains are collapsing,
[time=2511] the hundred pound hail stones are coming out of nowhere in the darkness and crushing people underneath their weight.
[time=2517] Christ bursts onto the scene on a white horse which is reminiscent in John's mind, I'm sure, of the Roman generals who when they would return from battle would prance their way into the city of Rome up the main street.
[time=2529] Via Sacra on their way to the great temple where they would receive all kinds of accolades and attention on a great white steed,
[time=2537] and behind them would come all of their military troops and all their spoils and all that they had captured.
[time=2542] And so in his mind he's probably seeing this great phenomenal triumphant parade of Christ coming to return to the earth and take it for his own.
[time=2554] You notice now that it's too late to repent. The day of grace is over, the day of mercy is over.
[time=2565] The compassionate soft carrying eyes of Christ who said to the woman who was caught in adultery, which of these who have not sinned should cast the first stone, they all disappear,
[time=2577] and he says, "I don't accuse you, either go your way and sin no more." The forgiving, gracious, compassionate eyes that wept over Jerusalem
[time=2586] and the people who had killed the prophets and spurned the marvelous grace of God through the centuries, all that's gone.
[time=2593] His eyes will weep no more. They are full of fire. They are full of judgment. And instead of from his words coming from his mouth, coming words of forgiveness, there comes now a sharp sword.
[time=2607] And we see that in verses 15 and 16, the rule of Christ. How does he conquer the world? How does he set up his kingdom? And what does it look like?
[time=2616] And from his mouth, verse 15, comes a sharp sword so that with it he may smite the nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron and treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty.
[time=2630] And on his robe and on his thigh he has the name written, King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=2638] All the armies of the earth are assembled. All the great military powers of the world are there, and he comes to do battle, and by the way you and I don't do much battle.
[time=2649] We're on horses and we're dressed very nicely, but we don't even, you know, dirty our hands. He's going to do it all.
[time=2656] You can do it all with the sword that comes out of his mouth. It's the Word of God. You remember Hebrews chapter 4? For the Word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow, able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[time=2675] And then right after that verse that most people don't read verse 13, and there is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[time=2692] So he comes in this picture of flaming judgment with a sword in his mouth which is sharper than any two-edged sword. It's alive, it's active, and he can see everything we are laid open before his penetrating gaze.
[time=2706] And then also in the book of Hebrews talking about the Word of his mouth.
[time=2711] It says this, "By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the Word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible."
[time=2719] You say, "How is Christ going to destroy all the armies and the people of the world just by saying things, just by talking, just by opening his mouth and articulating certain things?"
[time=2732] Because that's all it is. There's not a literal sword that comes out of his mouth and cuts people up. It is like the sword. It is the power of his Word.
[time=2740] And it was the very word. He didn't go to the hardware store and get the basic stuff to build the planet.
[time=2750] He went to no cosmic resource place to find the elements out of which he formed the heavens and the earth.
[time=2756] He just thought about it and spoke it into existence. And if he can speak it into existence, he can speak it out of existence.
[time=2766] And all the elements that compose the tanks and the missiles and whatever people are using when this happens to fight one another.
[time=2772] All the stuff, the basic, raw, essential elements that constitute their weaponry and their warfare and their own physical bodies, he controls all those elements.
[time=2781] And all he has to say is just disappear or be gone or stop working and functioning that way and they'll just explode on their own.
[time=2789] He won't break a sweat. He won't lift a finger. He won't be tired. He won't feel exhausted. Oh, I'm glad that battle's over.
[time=2799] He won't have any of that. He'll just be there and he'll utter a few words and the devastation will be unbelievable.
[time=2809] It says it in verse 15, "He will smite the nations." Very succinctly stated. Boom.
[time=2818] And then he will rule them with a rod of iron. It goes on to verse 15 to say, "The rod of iron, for us, for the believer in the millennial kingdom that he sets up and rules over,
[time=2830] that will be the most blessed experience of all. No more war, no more abuse, no more hardship, no more selfishness,
[time=2837] no more actions of disobedience because he's going to rule with a rod of iron.
[time=2843] In our country, you break the law, you go to court and you make appeals and you get out on probation and then you commit the same offense again
[time=2851] and you go through the same rigmarole again and it's just that justice is gone virtually in our country comparatively to where we started.
[time=2859] We're still better off than many nations in the world. But there's just injustice prevails. People go without punishment.
[time=2866] It won't happen that way when Christ comes back. When he is ruling in the millennial kingdom, he will rule with a rod of iron.
[time=2873] And if you break his law, you disobey his rules, you will pay for it.
[time=2879] It will be a time of great punishment. But the inverse of that, it will be a time of great blessing because he will reign and rule and lead.
[time=2887] And his leadership will be so effective and so complete and so pervasive that the world will know real peace and real joy
[time=2894] as it had only been promised under the Antichrist.
[time=2898] The wine press of his wrath is also mentioned in verse 15 and you know about that.
[time=2903] The grapes are thrown under the wine press, the weight of the human body come down upon the grape and the grape explodes and the juices are freed.
[time=2912] And though that is a redemptive thing when you're thinking about making something to drink, when you're talking about judgment, you're dealing with people's lives
[time=2919] and they are being pressed down upon by the wrath of God and their life blood is released.
[time=2926] It is the fierce wrath of the almighty God that they will experience.
[time=2932] The next thing that this little passage points out about his millennial reign is what will we call him?
[time=2938] Will we call him Mr. President? Will we call him Governor?
[time=2943] What will his title be? Well that's in verse 16. On his robe and on his thigh he has a name.
[time=2949] It's King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=2952] That's all he gets called. That's how you refer to him.
[time=2956] That is his title when he is being introduced, when he is being thanked, when he is being asked a question, the title is O King of Kings and Lord of Lords.
[time=2966] Doesn't that sound nice? Isn't that the way it ought to be? Marvellous.
[time=2973] Tremendous difference. His leadership will infect the whole wide world in his millennial kingdom.
[time=2981] But now back into the battle of Armageddon, verses 17 and following as we finish up the chapter, the ravaging of Christ.
[time=2988] Here's a little more detail. And I saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried out with a loud voice saying to all the birds which fly in mid-heaven come assemble yourselves for the great supper of God.
[time=3002] In order that you may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of commanders and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them and the flesh of all men, both free men and slaves and small and great.
[time=3015] In other words, the carnage that is going to be created by the utterance from his lips of their devastation as he destroys them in the battle of Armageddon will be so expansive and so great that the birds of the air are called in to do the cleanup.
[time=3030] In verse 21 you'll notice that they eat until their full, so that the end of verse 21 and all the birds were filled with their flesh, just enormous devastation and destruction.
[time=3044] You say, "Why are all of them there?" Verse 19, "I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to make war against him who sat upon the horse and against his army."
[time=3057] You say, "Why did all the kings come to the battle of Armageddon? Why did they bring all of their armies?" How is it? Christ hasn't even come yet. Why were they there? Why were they already there in full battle array?
[time=3072] Well, do you remember back in chapter 16? The sixth bull coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
[time=3081] There were three unclean spirits like frogs and these spirits were spirits of demons performing signs and they went out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the war of the great day of God the Almighty.
[time=3095] And they gathered them together to the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
[time=3100] They are there by the design of Satan who seeks to ward off the final coming of Christ, who hopes he can turn the tables in this one last desperate effort to maintain his control over the world system.
[time=3118] And so working in concert with God because God wants them there too, Satan in this last desperation effort sends out these demons across the earth and under their seducing power brings all the kings and all their military battle to this one place outside of Jerusalem.
[time=3135] They don't know why they're there. They may think they're there to fight each other. Satan knows why they're there and Christ knows why they're there.
[time=3144] And Satan is desperately hoping that somehow, some way he can pull this thing off.
[time=3152] But it's not to be. Verse 20, "The beast was seized and with him the false prophet who performed the signs in his presence by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image.
[time=3168] These two were thrown into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone."
[time=3174] So Christ apparently, the first thing he does is he takes a hold or has some of his angels take a hold of the Antichrist and the false prophet.
[time=3181] These two demon energized miracle workers and he throws them into the lake of fire.
[time=3189] Now do you realize these are the first inhabitants of the lake of fire?
[time=3192] There's nobody else there when they get there. It's just the two of them.
[time=3196] It was originally prepared for Satan and his demons, but the first inhabitants of the lake of fire are the Antichrist and his false prophet.
[time=3204] If you want to know how the story goes, come to chapter 20 verse 10.
[time=3208] At the end of the millennium, you know that during the millennium, Satan is bound.
[time=3213] At the end of the millennium, the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire where the beast and the false prophet are also.
[time=3222] And they are tormented day and night forever and ever.
[time=3226] And then after the great white throne judgment in verse 11, and the small and the great standing before the throne of God in verse 12, and the sea gives up the dead and all that were in it, and Hades gives up the dead which are in them and they're judged.
[time=3242] Every one of them according to their deeds, and then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=3248] There's the next inhabitants of the lake of fire. This is the second death.
[time=3252] And then verse 15, "Everyone, anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life, they were thrown into the lake of fire."
[time=3258] Now that place is full. No vacancy. It's finally completed.
[time=3264] What I find so in one sense intriguing and devastating in another sense is this.
[time=3270] The false prophet and the beast, they've been in there a thousand years
[time=3276] before eternity starts.
[time=3279] I mean they're just beginning after a thousand years of constant torment.
[time=3289] I don't know if you have any loved ones who have died without Christ.
[time=3294] I do. And when I come across this truth, it again reminds me that my loved ones
[time=3300] haven't even made it into the millennial period yet to suffer.
[time=3305] They're suffering still in just a normal course of history in a place called Hades, which is like hell.
[time=3315] And then Christ is going to come in the second coming and they're going to suffer for another thousand years
[time=3321] so that they can be brought back to the great white throne judgment, resurrected for that moment, judged and then sent to be punished for eternity.
[time=3330] It's mind-boggling isn't it?
[time=3333] A lot of theologians want to believe that there is no such thing as hell, that hell really is just a place of annihilation, that the soul loses its self-awareness.
[time=3343] But the Bible doesn't teach that.
[time=3346] As difficult as it is to comprehend that people are going to burn forever and ever and ever.
[time=3351] That's simply what the Bible says.
[time=3354] And some people have already been doing that for hundreds of years.
[time=3359] Thousands of years.
[time=3362] And it is just a holding tank until they can start doing it for eternity.
[time=3370] Well back to Revelation 19.
[time=3373] The beast is seized, the false prophet who performed the signs is seized and they're thrown into the lake of fire,
[time=3380] never ever ever to return again.
[time=3383] It burns there with fire and brimstone.
[time=3387] And the rest, the rest of the armies that had assembled there were killed with the sword which came from the mouth of him who sat upon the horse.
[time=3396] He just does his thing and they're all dead.
[time=3402] And then the birds have their fill.
[time=3405] An Armageddon is over and the world as we know it is over.
[time=3410] History as we have known it is gone, it's over, it's the end.
[time=3414] The earth stays around for another thousand years but that as we have noted it is under the reign of Christ and that will be a completely different existence than what we know today.
[time=3422] Completely different existence.
