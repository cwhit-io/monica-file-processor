[time=0] - Hello there and welcome to a special edition
[time=17] of the Bible Hour.
[time=18] I trust you had a wonderful 4th of July.
[time=21] We certainly did here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and with the Bible Hour.
[time=25] We welcomed some musicians and singers from the former Soviet Union and we celebrated together the freedom that they now have in which we have had in our country for a number of years the freedom to pursue Christ without persecution.
[time=39] And to introduce this wonderful group who really carried our service for us is Dr. Bob Provost, a longtime friend of mine.
[time=46] So stay with us as he introduces this group and as we share the wonder and the excitement that fills their hearts as they worship God.
[time=53] - It's a special blessing for Louetta and I'd like to be with you again this morning.
[time=58] And it's more special than ever because we have with us to help us celebrate our freedom to worship God a group called Blogavestia.
[time=69] Blogavestia means good news from Russia.
[time=72] They're going to be taking their positions on the platform in just a moment.
[time=77] And you're going to be in for a great, great blessing.
[time=80] I first heard this group just about six months.
[time=84] I guess about nine months ago at a pastor's conference we were outside of Moscow about an hour away with about 200 pastors studying together.
[time=92] And one evening they blessed us by sending this singing group, singing an orchestral group to minister to us.
[time=99] And we just sat there just hoping it would never be over and I think that's going to be your experience this morning.
[time=106] Leading the group is Pastor Boris Barrezhnoi.
[time=110] Pastor Barrezhnoi has a wonderful voice they're going to hear in a moment.
[time=114] I heard him sing several times previous to that of Moscow Baptist Church.
[time=119] His voice was so good that during the communist era he was forbidden by the KGB to sing for the glory of God.
[time=126] And often when he would sing in spite of this warning he would be arrested following the service and had to pay a fine for the privilege of singing glory to our God.
[time=135] He is now also the second or the co-pastor of second Baptist Church in Moscow.
[time=140] He's the leader of the group and soloist.
[time=143] The other soloist who you're going to hear in a few moments is Irina Timchenko.
[time=148] And then Pastor Nikolai Maslakov will also be sharing some words of testimony a little bit later on.
[time=155] Nikolai is pastor, senior pastor of the Matyshi Baptist Church which is located just north of Moscow.
[time=161] About 320 members and since they're baptizing 50 more people every time I ask.
[time=168] And he is also, Nikolai is also the assistant to Vasili Lagvenenko who is the president of all the Baptist churches in Russia.
[time=175] He has at least two full-time jobs.

[time=752] (audience applauds) (speaking in foreign language)
[time=782] - I have brought you very many greetings from the brothers and sisters in Russia and those in Moscow especially.
[time=790] (speaking in foreign language) - When Americans come to visit us, they tell us that they love us.
[time=799] (speaking in foreign language) - Today I'd like to tell you that we love you no less.
[time=806] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=812] (speaking in foreign language) - Before I tell you a little bit about myself and also our lives in Russia, I'd like to read two scriptures from the word of God.
[time=828] First Peter 4, 14.
[time=833] If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you.
[time=838] For the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you on their part, he is evil spoken of, but on your part, he is glorified.
[time=847] And the other is Romans, chapter eight verse 18.
[time=852] For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[time=862] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=871] - The church in Russia has suffered for a long time with a struggle against atheism and godlessness.
[time=879] (speaking in foreign language) - You have heard much about the suffering
[time=891] that the Christians have endured in Russia.
[time=894] (speaking in foreign language) - These sufferings have helped us become fiery in the Lord.
[time=903] (speaking in foreign language) - When I came to the Lord, I was 18 years old.
[time=913] (speaking in foreign language) - And I understood a truth that was very important.
[time=921] (speaking in foreign language) - That I needed to be a real Christian, not in name only.
[time=928] (speaking in foreign language) - When I was growing up, the people in the papers
[time=943] and all of my friends were speaking very poorly of my parents that they were Christians.
[time=949] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=956] - When I was in the fourth grade, my teacher told me to stand up and told the class that this is a son of Baptists but we hope that he won't follow in their footsteps.
[time=968] (speaking in foreign language) - That regime did many horrible things to the Christians
[time=982] and especially to their children.
[time=984] (speaking in foreign language) - But even that lie gave me the thought
[time=996] that I really wanted to serve Christ because I saw their lie and I saw their...
[time=1002] (speaking in foreign language) - I saw that my parents were honest people and so were all their friends.
[time=1013] (speaking in foreign language) - And so I understood that yes there is a God and there is someone who created this world.
[time=1025] (speaking in foreign language) - And so I decided to carry the name of Jesus
[time=1035] and to be a Christian everywhere I was, whether it be at work or at school.
[time=1039] (speaking in foreign language) - And so many of us that we had to decide to carry the cross to be a Christian.
[time=1051] (speaking in foreign language) - But that circumstance made us very dear to each other
[time=1061] and we held each other in great esteem.
[time=1064] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=1073] - And so because of this, the church was able to withstand these terrible circumstances.
[time=1080] (speaking in foreign language) - For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time
[time=1095] are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
[time=1101] (speaking in foreign language) - God has not placed us into an ideal utopia here on earth.
[time=1118] We all have sufferings, we all have disease and health problems, but to suffer for Christ is something totally different.
[time=1127] (speaking in foreign language) - And God wants through us suffering to know that He is Lord and also to be a servant and a fervent one
[time=1144] and that we need deeds as well as faith.
[time=1148] (speaking in foreign language) - I think it's going to be great when we get to heaven.
[time=1157] We'll all learn a lot from each other and also we'll have a lot to tell each other and we'll all be speaking the same language.
[time=1165] (speaking in foreign language) - I am waiting that joy with great anticipation.
[time=1174] (speaking in foreign language) - God bless you all.
[time=1177] - Amen.

[time=1972] Thank you.
[time=1973] (applause) (applause) (speaking in foreign language) I would like to greet you all with the words of Jesus, peace be with you.
[time=1989] (speaking in foreign language) And we'd like to bring a fragment of the peace from our Moscow church to you.
[time=2001] (speaking in foreign language) And please allow me to introduce you to the rest of our group.
[time=2012] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2021] First of all, I'd like to tell you that three or four years ago, there was only one Baptist church in Moscow, but thanks to the Lord.
[time=2030] (speaking in foreign language) That freedom has come and other circumstances have come to our country.
[time=2040] (speaking in foreign language) It has become possible for us to open many more churches.
[time=2048] (speaking in foreign language) So for that reason, today, there are seven Baptist churches in Moscow.
[time=2055] (speaking in foreign language) And we are all from different churches.
[time=2060] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2066] But thanks to the fact that we all were only in one church sometime back, we all know each other very well.
[time=2073] (speaking in foreign language) To the left of me is Yevgeni.
[time=2079] (speaking in foreign language) He is the director of one of the choirs.
[time=2087] (speaking in foreign language) He is playing today on the base Belalika.
[time=2094] (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2104] Sergey is also a director of a choir, and he plays on the accordion.
[time=2110] (speaking in foreign language) Okay, that is a special kind of accordion that does not have keys but has buttons,
[time=2119] and so it's called a bayon.
[time=2122] (speaking in foreign language) And this is Lubov Krelova.
[time=2127] (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2144] And now I'd like to read to you a scripture that is written in Luke, chapter 22, verse 33.
[time=2152] And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.
[time=2159] (speaking in foreign language) We are very grateful to your prayers,
[time=2169] and it's because of them that we are able to be here today among you.
[time=2173] (speaking in foreign language) Very often in our country there's all kinds of problems that occur,
[time=2188] but these all pass us by, especially when we came to getting our visas and our passports.
[time=2194] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2201] What is most important though in our lives is our prayer life and how we address our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2210] (speaking in foreign language) And here in this verse it's speaking of Peter.
[time=2216] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2223] Of the Peter who was very impulsive, who always tried to be first in everything.
[time=2228] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2234] And he was the first to say, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.
[time=2240] (speaking in foreign language) But later when we read the scripture we find that he later denied Christ.
[time=2249] (speaking in foreign language) And that's so puzzling to us. How can he do that?
[time=2259] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2267] But finally when we read the scriptures we do find that he does finally go to death for Christ.
[time=2274] (speaking in foreign language) These are very important words that the evangelist Luke has written.
[time=2283] (speaking in foreign language) God ready to go with thee.
[time=2289] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2298] Only with you. Only with God can we suffer through all the difficulties.
[time=2304] (speaking in foreign language) Today when we tell you that our country has suffered very much.
[time=2314] (speaking in foreign language) We understand perfectly that without God we could not have endured.
[time=2322] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2329] We would not have been here today with you.
[time=2332] We would not have been able to have this testimony about God to you.
[time=2338] (speaking in foreign language) We know that you prayed for us. You prayed for our freedom.
[time=2351] You prayed that freedom would come so that Christians could worship in peace.
[time=2356] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2365] I think that you would agree with me that when we have different sufferings, whether it be in the church or even family.
[time=2372] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2383] That always brings us closer to the Lord. It always sends us to the Lord.
[time=2389] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2396] So today I would like to ask you to continue to pray for us.
[time=2399] (speaking in foreign language) So that God would give us strength to hold on to His hand.
[time=2408] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2417] So that we would keep what we have gained, what has been so hard for us to gain, for us not to lose it.
[time=2424] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2432] I would also like to extend a great gratefulness to all the Americans who have helped us so much in the past.
[time=2440] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2447] At that time when it was impossible to print Bibles and to give them out, you did that for us.
[time=2454] (speaking in foreign language) We are earnestly grateful to you.
[time=2459] (speaking in foreign language) And we're also very grateful for Brother Provost.
[time=2465] (speaking in foreign language) Who does so much for our churches.
[time=2470] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2477] May the Lord bless you, and we will also pray for you that you not ever lose the presence of God.
[time=2483] (speaking in foreign language) And so that we would meet you again and maybe in heaven when we're all praising God.
[time=2493] (speaking in foreign language) Thank you.
[time=2496] (applause)
[time=2505] (upbeat music)
[time=2545] (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=2562] (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (upbeat music)
[time=2604] (applause)
[time=2619] (upbeat music)
[time=2629] The next song we'd like to sing is named "Russia Russia Neil Before God".
[time=2634] (speaking in foreign language) To be a Christian, you need faith and you need obedience to obey God readily.
[time=2645] (speaking in foreign language) This song not only is pertinent to the Russian people
[time=2656] but also to Americans.
[time=2657] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=2663] If we will not be obedient to the Lord, we will lose his hand and his blessings.
[time=2669] (speaking in foreign language) (upbeat music) (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language)
[time=2690] (singing in foreign language)
[time=2868] (applause)
[time=2890] As our brother quoted, the Apostle Peter said, "Lord, with you, I am ready to go both to prison and to death."
[time=2899] And as we have listened to this beautiful ministry and song,
[time=2905] we've been reminded, and as we've listened to their words, we've been reminded about how God answered our prayers and helped them hold on to the hand of God through the hard years.
[time=2920] And now, as they're with us today, which we never, ever imagined would be the case.
[time=2926] They're asking us, did you hear them?
[time=2928] They're asking us that we continue to pray that they would not lose hold of the hand of God.
[time=2935] Because their nation today is confronted with issues
[time=2941] and with conflicts and with problems and with distractions, the likes of which they have never seen before.
[time=2950] There were no false teachers coming into their churches before, and now their churches are being confronted with people who often don't teach what they thought they would teach, into their living rooms or coming false teachers from America, naming the name of Christ but not preaching the Bible.
[time=2968] And these pastors, both of these men are pastors.
[time=2971] The pastors of Russia are now having to help their people in a new way.
[time=2975] They're having to help their people.
[time=2977] They're having to help protect their sound doctrine, not from influence of the Communists.
[time=2983] They're gone by God's grace, but from influence from the outside coming in.
[time=2990] They've had not only great challenge from the Communists over the years, but they've had also economic challenge.
[time=2998] And now there is economic challenge beyond our imaginations.
[time=3002] Prices have gone up on some things, on most things, a thousand times in the past couple of years, not a thousand percent, but a thousand times.
[time=3012] And the average salary now in Russia is somewhere between $20 and $30 a month.
[time=3019] And that doesn't buy enough food and that doesn't buy clothes, that doesn't begin to buy because their inflation in this past year has not been two and a half percent or 25 percent, but 2,500 percent inflation in the last year.
[time=3034] Can you imagine?
[time=3037] And these two brothers, Pastor Boris and Boris and Pastor Nikolai,
[time=3044] are both pastors of churches that are growing relatively new churches and they're building buildings.
[time=3050] And there are now more than 150 churches in Russia that believe like we do who are trying to build new buildings and with such low salaries and with such high prices, for example, the price of a cubic meter of wood has gone up a thousand times in the last year.
[time=3070] A thousand times.
[time=3072] The price of a brick in these past three years has gone from three copacs, which would be comparable to cents in our currency, to 60 rubles.
[time=3081] In other words, it's gone from three cents to $60, if you compare it to dollars, for one brick.
[time=3088] Can you imagine?
[time=3090] Now they have unlimited freedom now.
[time=3093] They alluded to that a little bit and you've heard and read about that.
[time=3096] There's almost nothing you can't do.
[time=3099] You can worship God anywhere you want.
[time=3101] You can evangelize anywhere you want.
[time=3102] They have free access to their schools and hospitals and prisons.
[time=3105] Churches are starting in prisons.
[time=3107] They let you plant a church right in the prison.
[time=3109] They'll let you preach to every prisoner.
[time=3111] They'll release them all into a big open area.
[time=3113] You can preach to the whole prison.
[time=3115] They have unlimited opportunity now for the kingdom of God to go forth.
[time=3120] Our opportunities seem to be less and less in America, even as we celebrate this great day of our freedom 217 years ago today,
[time=3130] and we praise God for that and we're gathered together today to praise Him also for the freedom that our Russian brothers and sisters have enjoyed now just for a few years.
[time=3140] But within that, we have the resources.
[time=3144] God has blessed us as no nation has ever been blessed before.
[time=3148] Every one of us, right?
[time=3150] We don't even know how blessed we are until we go abroad and find out.
[time=3154] And God has blessed them with opportunities to advance the kingdom of God to 300 million people in the former Soviet Union in an unprecedented way.
[time=3165] They have the opportunities and we have the resources.
[time=3168] While it costs millions, hundreds and thousands of dollars to build a church in this country, millions often there.
[time=3174] They do all the labor.
[time=3176] They volunteer.
[time=3177] They do all the work and they just need help with the resources.
[time=3180] And we want to thank those of you here at Blackhawk who have already helped in the past.
[time=3185] Wasn't that exciting to hear those people sing of their love for God and for the person of Jesus Christ?
[time=3192] It amazes me that they come from a completely different country and yet they love the same Christ that's presented in the Bible.
[time=3200] And I believe with all my heart that the love of God goes beyond national boundaries.
[time=3204] It doesn't matter if you were born in America or in Russia or in France or Italy or some other country whether in India or Africa or Japan or Taiwan or China.
[time=3215] The love of God spans the globe and it presents the loving forgiveness that we can have in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3223] And just like the love of God goes across and over national boundaries, it goes across and over sin.
[time=3229] It doesn't matter what kind of sin you've been involved in, whether it's been an abortion or homosexuality or a chronic problem with lying or a sharp and bitter tongue that comes from an angry heart that alienates you from the people that you love.
[time=3243] The love of God can go across that sin and forgive it and wash it clean and make it new
[time=3249] and give you strength and purpose in your life to live for him.
[time=3253] And I hope that if your heart's been touched by the fresh worship of these people from Russia, that you'll open your heart to the same Christ, the same God, and let him do in your heart what he has done in their heart.
[time=3265] Think of all the reason they would have to be bitter because of the oppression of communism in their country and yet they're full of life and joy because of the forgiveness of God.
[time=3274] We pray that if God is speaking to you this morning, you would open your heart and receive him as your personal Savior.
[time=3279] And then you can sing the song "How Great Thou Art," which is the song that concludes our service.
[time=3285] Thank you for being with us.
