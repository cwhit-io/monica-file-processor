[time=0] and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed
[time=17] away.
[time=29] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=36] you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=39] Thank you for joining us.
[time=40] The hope of every Christian is that God will bring them safely through death to the shores of heaven.
[time=47] What will heaven be like?
[time=48] How will we get there?
[time=50] What will we see and do once we arrive?
[time=53] For answers to these questions stay with us today as we continue our study in the last chapters of the book of Revelation.
[time=61] Our special music today will be provided by Michelle Smeckens and Scott Schindler.
[time=74] Let's join our concert choir as they begin our service.
[time=104] [MUSIC - 475 seconds]
[time=607] Well good morning and welcome to the Bible hour. We're so thankful that you've joined us and I guess as we've been moving through the study of the book of Revelation theme continues to jump out in my mind and that's the sharp division and contrast between those who love Christ and are on that basis invited into Heaven for all eternity and those who do not love Christ and have not given their life to him and on that basis are not invited into Heaven and are excluded from all
[time=637] eternity in the marvelous presence and joy of being with God. I don't know if you've ever heard about a great event that was going on with your family members or friends and you really desperately wanted to go but there wasn't room for you there and you found out that you weren't invited and the pain and the sorrow that may have felt, filled your heart as you were really left out of a great time and a great opportunity of fellowship and friendship and I guess in human terms that's the closest we'll ever get to understanding the sorrow.
[time=666] The pain of being left out of the glories of Heaven and I'm also intrigued by the fact that most people make a decision for Christ at a very young age children in fact are the ones who most often turn their hearts to God. We have an offer for you in the Bible hour, the Bible character cards that are great opportunity for you to communicate the truth of Christ to a grandchild or to a neighborhood friend or even your own children. If you don't have these we'd like to send them to you.
[time=695] Our Bible character cards, you can write to us at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. A tremendous opportunity to make sure the young people in your life are included in the wonders and the glory and the fellowship of Heaven.
[time=713] Well now we'll go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our Bible hour.
[time=743] [MUSIC - 177 seconds]
[time=935] [APPLAUSE]
[time=955] How I wish I could say I've taught him everything he knows. No such luck. Well take your Bibles with me this morning and come back to the book of Revelation chapter 21.
[time=971] And we are fast approaching the end of the study of this book and I have to admit I have some sorrow in my own heart. I've been so moved by it and so involved in it and so thankful for it that I'm sorry to see it come to an end.
[time=988] I notice in the day that I haven't even decided what I'm going to speak on next which I probably need to figure out here pretty quick. See inside there's two more chapters in this book.
[time=999] But we have to date walk through the annals of time together in the book of Revelation. We have been through the church age in chapters 2, 3, and 4 of the book and we have seen Christ moving in and amongst the lamp stands as it were.
[time=1012] Purifying his church ever attending to the things and the needs and the purity of the church and its current age, our age.
[time=1020] And then we remember chapters 4 and 5 of the book of Revelation took us to the throne room of God.
[time=1026] And we saw there God enthroned and His holiness and His righteousness surrounded by myriads and myriads of angels and the 24 elders representing the raptured church.
[time=1036] The poor, redeemed community is there, prostrate on their knees and eventually on their faces, singing out the worthiness of the praise, the praises and the holiness and the righteousness of God.
[time=1046] It's almost as if before we were able to read the events of the great tribulation which immediately follow those two chapters.
[time=1053] We need to first to be reminded of His character and who He is so we dare not impugn His motives or His character as we see the devastating judgment that He brings upon mankind in the great tribulation.
[time=1065] Which we then looked at, seven years of hell on earth, seven years of the immediate direct wrath of God being brought upon a humanity that has rejected and spurned the love of God and the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1079] It opened with the seven seals, then the seven trumpets, then the seven bowls and with each series of judgments they came more severely and more harshly and in a quicker succession one following the next.
[time=1091] And it's a wonder the earth even could the physical earth could survive the devastation that came.
[time=1096] All of that climaxed under the domination and world leadership of the antichrist and the beast, the false prophet.
[time=1104] They assembled the armies of the world outside of Jerusalem and Christ returned, touched His feet on the Mount of Olives and then slew all of the armies of the world with the sword that came out of His mouth and the battle of Armageddon.
[time=1120] He then took Satan and bound him in the abyss for a thousand years and brought with him all the redeemed saints of all the ages to help administrate his new kingdom, the Millennial Kingdom for a thousand years Christ sat literally on the throne of David in Jerusalem
[time=1139] and exercised his administration over the nations of the world and brought perfect Millennial conditions for a thousand years.
[time=1146] At the end of which Satan was released from the pit, from the abyss, he moved in the hearts of the people to deceive the nations again and they assembled astonishingly enough multitudes of them so many that you couldn't count the number of them to assault and bring death to the person of Christ.
[time=1167] When they arrived at the scene, he killed them, destroyed them with fire that came down from heaven and that was the end of time.
[time=1174] As he judged everyone at the great white throne, judgment through them all, hell and Hades, all the second death in the lake of fire and we hear no more of them.
[time=1184] So by the time we come to Revelation chapter 21, time as we know it is over and we have come to the eternal state.
[time=1193] And a description of the new heaven, the new earth, the new Jerusalem and what we call heaven.
[time=1201] To fully appreciate what we're going to study, we need to go back in time and we need to see three distinct periods of time.
[time=1209] First before the fall, we'll look at three critical elements that marked human existence before the fall.
[time=1218] And then we'll look at those same three distinctives as they impact human beings after the fall from the time of the Garden of Eden until the second coming of Christ.
[time=1229] And having done that will be in a perfect position to appreciate the beginning description of the new heaven and the new earth that has given to us here in Revelation chapter 21 verses 1 through 8.
[time=1239] So we have to get our way back to this text starting back in Genesis chapter 1.
[time=1244] So if you would turn with me there, Genesis chapter 1.
[time=1247] And I know you're thinking, how is he ever going to do this and get us out of here on time?
[time=1253] But I think I can't. Like the little train on his way up the hill, I think I can.
[time=1261] Three critical, wonderful, marvelous elements that marked human existence prior to the entrance of sin into the world, Genesis chapter 1 verse 26 begins our understanding of life before sin.
[time=1277] Then God said, let us make man in our image according to our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth and God created man in his own image.
[time=1294] And the image of God created him, male and female, he created them.
[time=1300] You say, what does it mean to be created in the image of God?
[time=1305] If there is anything about the image of God that we need to focus on this morning, it is that God is a relational being.
[time=1313] If we could go to John chapter 1 verse 1, we would notice that it was God the Father and God the Son face to face in perfect fellowship enjoying each other's relationship from eternity past.
[time=1324] That's all they were doing back there was enjoying their perfect unhindered relationship with each other from eternity past.
[time=1332] And when God created man in his image, he did it with the explicit purpose of allowing man into the union and the fellowship and the enjoyment of that relationship with God.
[time=1344] And we know that as Christians, we know that ours is not a religion, it's a relationship, it's a relationship with the true and living God.
[time=1351] We could go to 1 Corinthians chapters 4 and 5 and talk about the marvelous doctrine of reconciliation, which is the notion that there was a perfect relationship which was then destroyed by something, we know that to be sin.
[time=1365] The doctrine of reconciliation is that it puts those relationships back into perfect harmony and perfect fellowship.
[time=1372] Suffice it to say that the first dimension of human life prior to the fall was perfect uninterrupted fellowship with the true and living God.
[time=1381] In fact, we were created in his image for that very purpose.
[time=1386] Secondly, the second dimension of human life before sin, chapter 1 verse 31.
[time=1393] And God saw all that he had made and behold, it was very good, speaking not just of man but of creation.
[time=1402] Man was in perfect fellowship with God and man was in perfect fellowship with all the created order which God looked at and said it was good.
[time=1411] And we only know now a remnant of what was the enjoyment of man of the created order.
[time=1419] God put him in charge of it and God knew that that created order would fill the soul, the capacity to feel and to experience of man with marvelous wonders and feelings as he experienced the created order.
[time=1431] You and I know that from time to time.
[time=1433] From time to time there's a beautiful sunrise or a beautiful sunset or a grandiose view or an incredible situation where the atmosphere and the temperature and the humidity all seems to work together to just scream at us and fill us with a sense of I'm glad I'm alive.
[time=1448] I'm glad I can experience creation, right?
[time=1452] Well they knew that before the fall constantly and at a level you and I can only taste but briefly here on earth today.
[time=1462] They were consistently filled with the sense of the glory and the wonder of God as he has communicated it to them through the created order.
[time=1473] And we know Romans 1 tells us there is still a remnant of the glory of God being spoken to the unsaved world.
[time=1479] But in the Garden of Eden it was uninterrupted, it was constant, it was just enough to make a person rapturous all the time.
[time=1486] Just being in God's creation.
[time=1489] So the first dimension of human life before the fall, perfect uninterrupted fellowship with God makes a person feel full and complete and happy and blessed and joyous.
[time=1500] Second dimension, the creation of God also created that same sense of fullness and wholeness and completeness.
[time=1508] The third dimension you need to come to chapter 2 verse 25.
[time=1512] You remember the story, God looked at Adam and said it's not good for Adam to be alone.
[time=1516] There's a missing dimension in this image of God bearer.
[time=1520] It's not enough that he has me, it's not enough that he has creation.
[time=1523] There's something not quite complete yet and so he put him to sleep, took a rib and he formed this wonderful thing called woman.
[time=1532] Verse 23 for example, when he took a look at her he said this is now a bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh.
[time=1539] It's difficult to translate the Hebrew there, he basically says wow, you got to be nuts.
[time=1546] This is for me, look at her. She shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and now the only description of relationships on the earth prior to the fall is found in verse 25.
[time=1560] The only hint, the only notion, the only little window that we get to look into what it was like to be in relationship with each other before the fall, before sin, verse 25.
[time=1570] The man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed.
[time=1575] That means that they were in perfect fellowship folks, they weren't just nude, they were naked emotionally, physically, mentally, spiritually in every possible conceivable dimension of relationship, there was nothing that stood between them.
[time=1589] They could see it all about the other person and the other person could see everything about them and so they were naked and then this marvelous refreshing statement and they were not ashamed.
[time=1599] There was nothing that had occurred in their relationship to cause any diminish of the quality of trust and faithfulness and respect and love, all the things that real relationships are built on.
[time=1611] None of that had been hindered, none of that had been impacted, they could see everything about the other person, the other person could see everything about them and there was no shame.
[time=1619] That's God's way of describing perfect relationship with another human being, marvelous.
[time=1629] So what was it like to be alive on God's created planet before sin?
[time=1635] Well, think of your happiest moment, multiply it by 10 and know that as your constant existence.
[time=1643] Why?
[time=1646] Because perfect relationship with God and perfect relationship with people and perfect relationship with created order left the human being with a sense of fullness and joy and peace and wholeness whatever words you want to use.
[time=1664] There's a piece.
[time=1667] It's called paradise.
[time=1672] As you know, when man fell, all three of those elements were negatively impacted.
[time=1680] Chapter three verse eight, "After the fall, after the woman is taken and eaten of the fruit, they heard the sound of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day."
[time=1689] Which, by the way, gives you indication of what he was doing before the fall. He was doing just that and there was yet another statement of this incredible fellowship between God and man.
[time=1697] They just walked together in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=1701] But now because of sin, the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord among the trees of the garden and then the Lord called and said to him, "Where are you?"
[time=1709] And he said, "I heard the sound of thee in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked so I hid myself."
[time=1716] God's way of saying now, "The polluting impact of sin has driven man from my presence." Man can no longer enjoy my presence.
[time=1724] Now when I am in the immediate presence of the created people who were in my image for the very purpose of enjoying relationship with me because of sin, instead of joy and peace and completeness and fullness, there is fear, there is shame, there is hiding, there is wanting to get out of his presence.
[time=1739] I hear him coming, I don't want to be near him and so I hide.
[time=1747] Secondly, what happens to the relationship or the quality of relationship between the two people on the earth?
[time=1754] Is that still characteristic of being naked and not ashamed?
[time=1758] Verse 11 and he said, "Who told you that you were naked?
[time=1761] Have you eaten from the tree which I commanded you not to eat and the woman said?" Oh, excuse me, and the man said, "The woman whom thou gave us to be with me, she gave me from the tree and I ate."
[time=1772] He's blaming her.
[time=1774] He's shifting his responsibility to have obeyed the clear commands of God.
[time=1778] He is saying to the very direct question of God, "Did you eat from the tree?" He said, "I did, but I did because it was her fault." She offered it to me.
[time=1786] She invited me to partake.
[time=1789] That's a long way from being naked and not ashamed.
[time=1792] That's a long way from Adam playing the godly role of a husband in the life of his wife,
[time=1799] where he might have said, "Yes, I did.
[time=1801] It's my responsibility, and Lord, I even take responsibility for the fact that my wife ate too."
[time=1808] But instead, there's blaming.
[time=1809] And so there is the breakdown of human relationship and no longer does human relationship provide the fullness
[time=1816] and the sense of completeness and wholeness, the naked and not ashamedness of pre-fall condition.
[time=1823] And say, "What about earth?" Well, look at verse 17.
[time=1828] Part of the curse is that the earth got cursed.
[time=1833] Verse 17, "God says to Adam, 'Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, saying you shall not eat from it,
[time=1840] cursed it is the ground because of you. In toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life, both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you.
[time=1847] You shall eat the plants of the field by the sweat of your face.
[time=1852] You shall eat bread till you return to the ground." And so we know the earth to be cursed.
[time=1859] The earth is no longer a place of blessing.
[time=1862] There is just a remnant of the original glory that it once held.
[time=1865] But the vast majority of the earth or the impression that we get from the earth is that it is fully cursed by God.
[time=1873] Job 15, 15 says this, "The heavens are not pure in his sight." Isaiah 24, 5 says, "The earth is polluted, not by machinery and chemicals."
[time=1884] It says this, "The earth is polluted by its inhabitants, for they have transgressed laws, violated statutes, broke the everlasting covenant."
[time=1894] It was the sin of Adam and Eve and the sin of everybody who has lived since that has polluted the earth and made it fully embracing the curse that God put upon it so that it was no longer a haven of rest, a protective place.
[time=1909] And you need only look in your newspaper and turn on your TV to find the extent to which the curse moves in and out through the earth.
[time=1916] People are dying in floods and hurricanes and volcanoes and starving to death and droughts all the rest of it.
[time=1923] It's anything but the sympathetic, supportive, harmonious domain which God originally gave to man.
[time=1930] And though you and I can still sense a remnant of the glory of the earth when we see a beautiful sunset and have that feeling inside of us,
[time=1939] we are far, far removed from the level of fullness that it was intended to give.
[time=1949] Before sin, perfect relationship with God, people, and the created universe left a man with a sense of wholeness, completeness, satisfaction, contentment continually.
[time=1961] When sin enters the world, all three of those are impacted negatively, no longer in perfect fellowship with God, instead fearing him, running from him, hiding from him, ashamed to be in his presence, a sense of guilt, a sense of shame.
[time=1978] Man and wife, instead of a loving, protective, supportive union, now struggle with the intention and the desire to continually shift, blame, and find fault and seek and pursue self-interest instead of the other person's well-being.
[time=1995] In the creation itself groans, Romans 8 tells us, the very creation groans longing for its own redemption at the coming of Christ, this earth is groaning, waiting for its ultimate demise where the new earth and the new heaven will be recreated.
[time=2013] And that's where I want to camp for a minute. What does that produce in the heart of the human? What is the absence of perfect relationship with God, perfect relationship with people, and perfect relationship with creation? What does it create in us?
[time=2025] And if you will now, Isaiah, Isaiah chapter 55.
[time=2047] This is the greatest evangelistic call of the Old Testament. Listen to what God says.
[time=2057] Isaiah 55 verse 1, "Oh, every one of you who thirsts, come to the waters, and you who have no money come by and eat, come by wine and milk without money and without cost."
[time=2077] Why do you spend money for what is not bread? And your wages for what does not satisfy? Listen carefully to me and eat what is good and delight yourself and abundance, incline your ear and come to me."
[time=2091] What is he saying? He identifies the emptiness inside of the human heart. What emptiness? The emptiness that is there because we're no longer in perfect fellowship with God and with each other and with creation.
[time=2104] He identifies that emptiness and that sense of longing and that restlessness and that unsatisfied general condition of human life. He calls it thirst.
[time=2115] He likens it to spiritual thirst or uses the analogy of physical thirst to draw the picture of spiritual thirsting.
[time=2122] And as we read this morning from the Psalm 63 with David, we saw him out there crying out and he says, "I live in a dry and a weary land where there is no water."
[time=2132] And he says, "I'm thirsting for God."
[time=2139] What I want you to notice about Isaiah 55 is that God does not condemn the thirsting. He never says you shouldn't thirst.
[time=2148] He totally legitimizes the thirst. In fact, it's the basis of his evangelistic call. I know you're thirsty. It's okay that you're thirsty.
[time=2157] You've got to be thirsty. You're no longer in perfect relationship with me, people on earth. There must be this gnawing thirst in your soul that says there's got to be more.
[time=2168] I have to have been created for more to receive more out of my existence than this. Guilt from God because I'm a sinner.
[time=2177] Broken relationships with people because we're sinners and on earth that is cursed and is but a slight remnant of what it was originally intended to be.
[time=2187] You've got to be thirsty. It's okay to thirst. Thirst.
[time=2194] If you're thirsty, come to me. Look at it again in verse 1. You who have no money buy and eat. How do you buy when you don't have money?
[time=2203] Come buy wine and milk without money and without cost. You hear him, don't you? He is beginning to herald the message of the gospel that you can be saved by the blood of Christ, not by your own merit, not by your own doing, but by the sacrificial work of Christ on the cross.
[time=2221] You can come and you can have the satisfying of the longings of your heart in the person of Christ.
[time=2230] But look at the question in verse 2. This is so insightful. He says to them, "Why? Why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy?"
[time=2242] And there's the question of the ages. He doesn't condemn them for their thirst. He offers to resolve their thirst free of charge but he does have a penetrating question.
[time=2252] Why do you spend your money, your time, your resources trying to satisfy the thirst in your soul with things that are not truly bread?
[time=2264] Why do you spend money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy?
[time=2271] Come to me. I can satisfy. And alone I can satisfy the thirst in your soul.
[time=2278] Now come a book towards the New Testament to the book of Jeremiah. Just move one book like you're going to the New Testament. It's a few pages over.
[time=2286] I want to show it to you again. He uses a slightly different picture. Jeremiah chapter 2 verses 1 and following.
[time=2297] He says there, "The word of the Lord came to me saying," now verse 2, "Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem saying, 'Thus says the Lord.'"
[time=2307] I remember concerning you, the devotion of your youth, the love of your betrothels.
[time=2313] You're following after me in the wilderness through a land not sown. He's giving fond fatherly reflections of a time when the people of Israel were fixed on him.
[time=2325] When their hearts were set upon God and they were following him in the wilderness.
[time=2330] He speaks of the devotion of their youth, the love of your betrothels. He sees his relationship with Israel as a marriage relationship and the intimacy of relationship. He loves it. He remembers it.
[time=2342] But verse 5, "Thus says the Lord, 'What injustice did your fathers find in me that they went far from me?'"
[time=2352] In other words, what was it about me that turned your heart against me to have you find the satisfaction for your longings in other things?
[time=2361] Look at again verse 5, "They went far from me and walked after emptiness and became empty."
[time=2370] Now folks, if you're in touch with any people who don't know Christ, and if you're in touch even sometimes with your own sense of the soul, the condition of your soul, you know that people are empty.
[time=2382] You know that people are having a sense of incompleteness and their hollow inside and they don't know what they're about and they can't seem to feel complete and whole.
[time=2391] And God is saying to these Israelites as an example to us, "When you turn from me, you are walking after emptiness and you become empty."
[time=2400] You're pursuing the futility. He summarizes in verse 13. Look at it with me verse 13.
[time=2410] "For my people have committed two evils. The first they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters."
[time=2418] Notice again, he doesn't condemn them for their thirst. He doesn't condemn them for their longings.
[time=2423] He condemns them for having forsaken him, the very fountain of living waters.
[time=2427] And then the second thing they have done is that they have hewn for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.
[time=2437] Now this is a beautiful picture. A cistern, you may not know what that is, but that was a mini well you would take and you would dig with a shovel or something that looked like a shovel and you would create a holding tank for your water.
[time=2450] So when you're thirsty, you could go get something to drink.
[time=2455] And he says that by turning and forsaking me, the fountain of living water, you have made for yourself your own cistern.
[time=2462] You are saying you can find satisfaction for your soul outside of me on your own.
[time=2468] But in reality, these are broken cisterns. They hold no water.
[time=2477] You say, how do we do that? How do we do that in our day and age? We don't even know what a cistern is. How does it happen in 1993?
[time=2487] Well, I was looking at my news week. It came this week. I think it was the July 19th issue.
[time=2493] And I just breezed through it and looked for ways, looked for broken cisterns.
[time=2497] And I didn't have to look far, the cover. You know what's on the cover? If you've got it, you know. If you don't, I'll tell you.
[time=2501] The cover, it says on the edge in big, bold letters, and there's this guy, this cliffhanger, holding with one hand on just a little fingerhold on the edge of this cliff, this rock, jagged rock.
[time=2512] And it comes down to his body and then it just breaks away from him, so he is literally hanging thousands of feet in the air by his fingertips.
[time=2522] Also on the cover, it says this, mountain biking, river running, ice climbing, sky surfing, and bungee jumping. Subtitled, are we crazy or just looking for fun?
[time=2539] One of the ways that we seek to fill the emptiness, because we have pursued emptiness and have become empty. One of the cisterns that we build.
[time=2548] One of the ways we take cash out of our pockets and try to buy a quenching, refreshing thirst, a drink to refresh us of our thirst, is this whole motion of the adrenaline rush that is new and phenomenal and fantastic to our day and age.
[time=2565] Nothing wrong with mountain climbing or river running or ice climbing, but understand we see there the thirsting of the soul and the attempt to find at least temporary relief in the adrenaline rush of a near death experience.
[time=2580] I turn the next page in my Newsweek and I found there an advertisement for Johnson and Murphy shoes. Nothing wrong with Johnson and Murphy shoes.
[time=2588] The way they captioned the ad, the foot of this, you never saw the guy, just his foot and the first part of his shin, the shoe was forward in the lens of the camera, so it was a predominating image, but behind that and slightly out of focus, a big beautiful private aircraft, twin engine plane, and of course standing in front of the plane, you guessed it, a beautiful woman.
[time=2607] These are via the caption, any time, any place, anywhere. So I'm supposed to get the impression that if I could just dress the right way, maybe specifically with Johnson and Murphy shoes, that this kind of feeling, this kind of sense of wholeness where I'm this really competent person, I own my own aircraft, I'm a pilot, and there's a beautiful woman waiting to go with me, any place, any time, anywhere.
[time=2636] The whole lie of materialism, somehow materialism is going to satisfy the longing and the emptiness and the sense of "ah, wasn't I made for more than this?"
[time=2649] I turn the page, I come to the Letter to the Editors section, and there is a response to their previous last month issue on lesbians, and if you didn't happen to see that cover, there were two very beautiful women embracing each other, and the title said "lesbians."
[time=2664] And then the whole main feature article was about this new outcoming of lesbians in America.
[time=2672] Well, apparently that drew some fire, they received some 600 letters of protest against that bold presentation of lesbianism, and so in the letters to the editors, this month they gave their response.
[time=2683] You know what it was? Time magazine is proud to present the needs and the concerns and the interests of the lesbian community, because we believe that the world needs more love, and we don't care if the world needs more love.
[time=2693] We don't care if the world gets its love through straight relationships or through gay relationships.
[time=2700] Thirsty people, huh?
[time=2702] Do you realize that God would never come to a lesbian and say it's wrong for you to thirst in your heart for a sense of love, and intimacy, and union, and fellowship, and support, and camaraderie?
[time=2715] He would never tell them that that desire is wrong, but he would say to them you are digging broken cisterns, you are seeking emptiness, and you are becoming empty, because you cannot find the satisfaction of your soul in a relationship with another person, much less a person completely outside of the divine role for men and women.
[time=2736] So I turn another page and I come to a new article. It's about Jennifer, who's 14, Jennifer Eartman, and Elizabeth Pina, who is 16, they've been at a pool party in Houston, and they're walking home.
[time=2747] And they decide to take a little bit of a shortcut today, and so they go through the woods, and when they go through the woods, they meet 16 age boys between the ages of 14 and 18. The article reads this.
[time=2759] "The nude bodies of the girls were found four days later. They had been raped repeatedly and strangled, one with a belt and the other with shoelaces.
[time=2770] To ensure that both of them were dead," the police spokesman said, "the suspects stood on the girl's necks."
[time=2781] You say, "Now, what does that have to do with thirsting after God? What does that have to do with broken cisterns?"
[time=2792] Well, it might be interesting for you to know that these six boys gathered there in that woods to initiate two of them into their gang.
[time=2800] The two young boys that were going to be initiated had to first go through the initiation rite of a literal fist fight with some of the gang members, which they had just completed.
[time=2810] They were all revved up over all of that when these two girls came by and they attacked them and did all that this article says they've done. At least they're accused of that.
[time=2819] Now, I don't know the backgrounds of all these boys, but let me tell you about one of them. Derek Sean O'Brien, 18 years old.
[time=2827] He comes from a broken home. He was raised by his grandmother. He does not know who his father is.
[time=2836] He was molested by a male schoolteacher, and he has attempted suicide several times.
[time=2847] Sounds like a long way from the Garden of Eden to me.
[time=2851] Here you've got a young boy who doesn't know who his parents are molested by the only person who should have been an authority to care for him and nurture him and develop him into something worthwhile in his life.
[time=2863] He's trying to take his own life. He finds some other people who will give him a sense of longing and a sense of identity, and so he says, "I'll be with you, and whatever you guys do, I'll do."
[time=2875] You realize that God would never come to that young boy and say, "You shouldn't have the longing to have identity and to have friends and to have a sense of purpose and to have things in your life that satisfy the emptiness and the longing that fills your life."
[time=2889] He would never condemn the man or the young boy for those longings and those desires.
[time=2897] But he does say, and he will say, sparing that this young boy comes to Christ, "The manner in which you have sought to fill your longings have been foolish and sinful, and for that I hold you completely accountable."
[time=2920] We take no excuses for their behavior, but we look behind their behavior to an empty heart, to a soul that was built to experience perfect relationship with God and people in creation, and in the absence of it, there's enough hurt and enough pain and enough restlessness and emptiness that he'll grab on to anything.
[time=2939] I kept going in my little magazine, and I came to the mail order section of the magazine, where I was invited to put down $120 and buy an extra-climed machine, which according to the person standing and exercising on the extra-climed machine, guaranteed me that if I would just do it, I would look like that person.
[time=2957] I would be in absolute perfect shape, and there is yet another way in which people try to fill the emptiness of their souls to have a physical physique that makes them vogue, that makes them in, that makes them desirable, and they say, "Here is my identity. Here is why I live. This is my sense of wholeness, the way I care for my body."
[time=2978] Well, I stopped going through the magazine. I'm sure if I'd gone through more, there would have been more examples. We're a thirsty generation, we're a thirsty people, and we're digging broken cisterns.
[time=2991] So with that, let's go back to Revelation 21.
[time=2998] And you will find the reversing of all these problems. We will go back in Revelation 21 to pre-fall conditions.
[time=3009] The first thing you see in Revelation 21 verse 1, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and there is no longer any sea."
[time=3020] God destroys the first heaven and the first earth at the end of the age. 2 Peter 3 tells us He melts it down with a roar. The elements are destroyed with intense heat, and the earth and its works will be burned up.
[time=3034] He does that because the old earth is cursed. He does that because the old earth will never bring back to man the sense of fullness and joy and wholeness and complete, that His first earth untouched by sin did.
[time=3047] And so He must destroy the first earth and the first heaven, so in creating the new one, He can restore it to its original glory.
[time=3057] Notice the second thing. In verse 3, we'll talk about the New Jerusalem next week. So skip verse 2, come to verse 3, "And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'This behold, the tabernacle of God is among men, and He shall dwell among them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be among them.'"
[time=3076] Now we're back to God walking in the cool of the day in the garden. Now we're back to the immediate, constant, unbroken, unhindered fellowship of the image bearer with His Creator.
[time=3089] All that God created us to experience by making us in His image will be fully and completely satisfied every moment of every day because we'll be in the new heaven and the new earth and the immediate uninterrupted fellowship of God. He will tabernacle among us. He will be with us again.
[time=3104] So in 73, 25 says this, "Whom have I in heaven but thee?" He punctuates the point. The only thing I'm really looking forward to in heaven is God Himself, the very person of God.
[time=3117] And by the way, the essence of hell is the absence of God, the absolute opposite. 2 Thessalonians 1-9, listen.
[time=3126] And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power.
[time=3134] You want to know what hell is? Hell is being absolutely totally separated from the presence and the glory of God.
[time=3145] So He creates a new heaven and a new earth and all of its splendor and He puts Himself in the middle of it all and He can now dwell with His people because they, and this is the third point, they are perfect.
[time=3155] And we've seen that already in previous texts. They are all glorified. It's you and me. By the grace of God, the forgiveness of our sins, we receive glorified bodies and we are purified completely and totally.
[time=3165] There's never another sinful thought. There's never another sinful action. There's never another sinful motive.
[time=3169] We are back to being naked and not ashamed. The relationship of the company of the redeemed in heaven will be perfect.
[time=3179] So verse 4, look at it. "And He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there shall no longer be any death, and there shall no longer be any mourning or crying or pain because the first things have passed away.
[time=3194] And He who sits on the throne, behold, I am making all things new, right, for these things are faithful and true." Verse 6, I love this, and He said to me, "It is done.
[time=3202] I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end." In other words, I've done it. I'm back to where I want to be.
[time=3208] I created a perfect condition in the first place. Satan rebelled. Humanity rebelled. The earth was cursed, and we've lived now some 6,000 years in this awful condition of the fall, and people are hurting and thirsty and seeking the illegitimate satisfaction of the desires in ways that only God has.
[time=3223] The desires in ways that only damn them to hell forever, but now that's gone, that's over, it's done. We're back to perfect conditions forever and ever.
[time=3234] And then look again at verse 6. "I don't know where, sort of. I will give to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost.
[time=3250] As if to say, heaven will satisfy all your thirsts." Then he adds a warning in verses 7 and 8, "He who overcome shall inherit these things.
[time=3261] The overcomer we know to be the believer, the person who has put their faith in Christ. I will be His God, and He will be My Son."
[time=3269] Verse 8, "But for the cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murders and immoral persons and sorcerers,
[time=3276] in the Greek pharmacaia," another word for drugs, "and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."
[time=3289] So verses 1 through 4, he describes the new heaven and the new earth, the fact that he will be there personally, everything will be like new, so there'll be no more tears, no more sorrow, no more pain.
[time=3299] Verse 5, he adds a commentary to it. Verse 6, he says, "Last time invitation to those of you who are reading this before the end of the age,
[time=3309] please understand I want to give you this," what, "to the one who thirsts from the spring of the water of life without cost."
[time=3317] He lists the pages off of Isaiah 55 and Jeremiah 2 and John 4 and says, "This is the culmination of everything I've ever promised the human being,
[time=3326] and I'll give it to you without cost, complete total satisfaction of the soul because you'll be in my presence in my new heaven and my new earth and around redeemed people."
[time=3340] But the warning is sure, the warning is sure, without Christ in your life, you'll never see it.
[time=3350] When the disciples were gathered and Christ was saying that he would go and prepare a place,
[time=3357] he would make many mansions for us describing this new heaven and the new earth and the new Jerusalem, which we'll see next week.
[time=3363] And he said, "If I go, I'll come again and take you." And Thomas got so excited about it. He said, "Man, I want to go to heaven. How do I get to heaven?"
[time=3371] He said, "Lord, we don't know where you're going and we don't know how to get there because the Lord was going to sin in a few minutes and disappear from human sight."
[time=3379] And Thomas was saying, "Man, if you're going someplace to prepare a mansion for me, I'd like to know how to get there."
[time=3385] To which the Lord responded, "I am the way, the truth and the life. No man comes under the Father but by me."
[time=3395] Personal faith in Jesus Christ guarantees this kind of existence for all eternity.
[time=3403] Without Christ, there is the absence of God and the fullness of pain and sorrow and suffering for all eternity.
[time=3412] Let's pray together.
[time=3414] Well, that's an exciting day the Bible describes in heaven and I don't want you to miss that.
[time=3436] And if you've never prayed to receive Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, I invite you to do that with me now.
[time=3442] Father, I know that I am a sinner and I'm deserving of death, not life, hell, not heaven.
[time=3449] But I want to have my thirst quenched without cost. I want to come to Christ.
[time=3454] I ask Him into my life. I pray that He'll forgive me for my sins and I'm a pint, Lord, from my sin and come to Christ.
[time=3461] And pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3465] Well, we'd love to hear the nature of your decision, so please write to us and we'll send you some information about getting started in your Christian walk.
