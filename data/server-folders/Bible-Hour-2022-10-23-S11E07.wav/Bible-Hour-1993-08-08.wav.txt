[time=11] Hope is the stuff that keeps people alive.
[time=15] Hope is that something that breeds inside your heart that says it's worth living through the rest of this day to get to tomorrow and the day after that.
[time=23] There's purpose in my life and there's a reason to live.
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=38] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=41] An hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=47] Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] Where do you turn for help when the hardship and discouragement of life become too much to handle?
[time=55] Is there a way to be renewed back to a place of strength and hope?
[time=59] Stay with us this morning as we look for answers to these important questions from God's Word.
[time=64] Our special music today will be provided by David Staton and Becky Wollman.
[time=73] [MUSIC]
[time=76] Let's join our Chancellor Choir as they begin our service.
[time=80] [MUSIC]
[time=97] Hope is everlasting love.
[time=103] Let my praise have up to no, spirit breathing from above.
[time=112] God has taught me this soon.
[time=116] How this whole and perfect He is from His presence all divine.
[time=125] In a love which cannot cease, I am His and He is mine.
[time=146] When the bond is so true, for the bond is sweet and green, something lives in every view.
[time=159] O Christ the sons have never seen!
[time=164] Birds in song, its glory show, flowers with deeper beauty shine.
[time=173] Since I know as now I know, I am His and He is mine.
[time=194] [MUSIC - 61 seconds]
[time=265] Some months ago David Staton joined our choir and has been very faithful.
[time=269] Just appreciate his ministry with us and we welcome him to Blackhawk.
[time=273] He's coming to minister to us in song now.
[time=275] Let's open our heart to the message he has.
[time=278] [MUSIC]
[time=290] There's an audience our eyes have never seen.
[time=295] He's clogged in royalty and roped in majesty.
[time=302] Let us not forget its healing we raise.
[time=307] And not each other I sing to you.
[time=314] You sing to me, but our audience is Jesus.
[time=321] So, Jesus, from my soul,
[time=327] from my soul this song will rise from my soul.
[time=334] My soul this song's a lie.
[time=337] And I know that you hear every word I sing that you're throwing.
[time=346] Now this offering that I bring comes from my soul.
[time=355] [MUSIC]
[time=361] If our hearts were known it's you we long to please.
[time=367] Here to serve you giving thanks for everything.
[time=374] We can't see you but you told us you'd be here.
[time=379] Loving our praises we may sing softly.
[time=386] But it's all done for your glory.
[time=391] Your glory from my soul.
[time=398] My soul this song will rise from my soul.
[time=405] My soul this song's a lie.
[time=408] And I know that you hear every song I sing that you're throwing.
[time=415] This offering that I bring comes from my soul.
[time=424] I love you love from my soul.
[time=432] I'm singing to my soul.
[time=435] My soul this song will rise from my soul.
[time=444] I love you love from my soul.
[time=449] My soul this song will rise from my soul.
[time=476] My soul this song's a lie.
[time=479] And I know that you hear every word I sing that you're throwing.
[time=489] This offering that I bring comes from my soul.
[time=497] My soul this song will rise from my soul.
[time=503] I saw this song's a lie.
[time=506] And I know that you hear every word I sing that you're throwing.
[time=516] This offering that I bring comes from my soul.
[time=523] My soul this song will rise from my soul.
[time=528] My soul this song's a lie.
[time=531] And I know that you hear every word I sing that you're throwing.
[time=541] This offering that I bring comes from my soul.
[time=556] Well, good morning and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=559] We're thrilled that you're with us this morning and are trusting that God will do great things in our midst.
[time=564] As you know, we've completed the study of the Book of Revelation.
[time=568] We're planning to spend the next several weeks throughout the rest of the summer studying topical messages from the Word of God.
[time=574] I'm excited about the study this morning.
[time=577] It's about hope recovering from despair and depression and a sense of emptiness, a sense of hopelessness.
[time=585] And I'm thankful that the Word of God gives us very specific and encouraging and practical instruction about recovering from that low point in our life.
[time=595] And in fact, I would encourage you to think maybe of a friend or a family member who you've noticed has kind of lost the spunk for life.
[time=603] Their energy levels are low and they're really kind of running on empty and they need a good shot in the arm.
[time=610] They need encouragement from God's Word that the Lord isn't finished with them yet and that there is a bright and a wonderful future for them.
[time=616] This message may be just that encouragement.
[time=619] So you might want to call them or ask them to come into the room and share this time or record it on your VCR or call us for a copy here at the Bible Hour.
[time=627] We'd be happy to supply you with that.
[time=630] Also, I want to ask you to be praying for the Cobies.
[time=633] Pastor Peter Cobie is such a wonderful blessing from the Lord. His uncle, Tony Cobie, has gone home to be with the Lord.
[time=641] And Tony was like a father, a second father to Peter.
[time=645] And so I just ask that you'd be in prayer for the Cobie family as they recover from the loss of this dear beloved Godly example.
[time=652] Tony was a great man of God and lived faithfully the things in the Word of God and as we are thankful has made a great investment in Peter's life.
[time=660] And so hold them up, will you?
[time=662] I also want you to know about the free offer we're giving as a premium this month on the Bible Hour.
[time=668] It's by Leroy Iams.

[time=709] The Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=719] Well, I trust that you're sensing the joy of the summer months that the weather has been an encouragement to you and that you're looking with optimism to the fall and how God will use you.
[time=729] We're thankful for your partnership in this ministry, for the opportunity that we have to come into your home and to encourage you with a message from God's Word and the joy that the music always represents.
[time=741] Well, you're in our prayers and we trust that God will give you a special sense of His presence, even this day.
[time=748] And now let's go back to the regular portion of our service.
[time=753] In this quiet place with you, I bow before you're thrown.
[time=774] I bear the deepest part of me to you and you alone.
[time=782] I keep no secrets for there is no thought you have not known.
[time=790] I bring my best and all the rest to you and lay them down.
[time=804] With all my heart, I want to love you, Lord, and live my life each day to know you more.
[time=822] And that is in me, is yours completely.
[time=830] I'll serve you only with all my heart.
[time=850] You faithfully supply my needs according to your plan.
[time=859] So help me, Lord, to seek your faith before I seek your hand.
[time=867] Trust, you'll know what's best for me when I don't understand.
[time=880] Then follow in obedience in every circumstance.
[time=895] With all my heart, I want to love you, Lord, and live my life each day to know you more.
[time=909] To know you more, all that is in me, is yours completely.
[time=919] I'll serve you only with all my heart.
[time=939] Oh, my heart.
[time=959] [AMEN] Thank you, Becky.
[time=961] And that is the desire of our hearts to be totally, completely devoted to God.
[time=967] Well, let me invite you to take your Bible this morning and turn to Revelation.
[time=972] Excuse me.
[time=973] That's out of habit.
[time=974] Romans, actually is where we want to go.
[time=977] Romans chapter 15, Romans chapter 15 verse 4.
[time=982] And as you know, and can tell even this morning, we have been in the study of the book of Revelation and have finished that book.
[time=988] Wonderful time in God's Word.
[time=990] And spending the rest of the summer weeks here kind of grabbing a hold of different topics out of the Word of God
[time=996] and finding what He might say to us through them.
[time=1000] And we began this morning in Romans chapter 15 verse 4.
[time=1008] Well, I guess it all began in a little town called Hope.
[time=1013] Hope Arkansas.
[time=1016] Vincent Foster began to build his lifelong relationships with at least one man by the name of Bill Clinton,
[time=1024] a boyhood friend.
[time=1025] And Vincent soon found out that he was a very gifted and talented young man.
[time=1030] He came from a very wealthy family.
[time=1032] His father was a real estate businessman.
[time=1035] He eventually became the senior president of his, the president of his senior class,
[time=1041] later led his law school as first in the class, scored the highest in the Arkansas bar exam
[time=1047] when he sat for it in that particular year.
[time=1050] Was soon hired with a leading law firm in Little Rock, Arkansas and began to command a salary of some $300,000 a year.
[time=1059] And then when his boyhood friend Bill Clinton went to Washington, he went with him and served as deputy White House counsel.
[time=1069] Vincent also had a wife and three kids and seemed to have absolutely everything anyone could ever hope for.
[time=1079] But on a Tuesday afternoon, not too long ago, as you're aware from the reports that have come from Washington
[time=1085] and through the media, he left the White House, entered a national park in honor of the Civil War, called Marcy Fort,
[time=1094] went there by a cannon, took a 38 revolver, put it in his mouth and pulled the trigger and ended his life.
[time=1103] And in the absence of a suicide note or the absence of any really clear motive for why he might have done this,
[time=1110] it's left a lot of questions in a lot of people's minds.
[time=1114] And the articles I was reading were talking about reporters suggesting there simply had to be more going on here than met the eye.
[time=1121] They're hunting around for some private horror or secret scandal which might have come to the surface
[time=1127] and led Mr. Foster to end his life prematurely rather than to face the public shame.
[time=1133] Maybe that's true and then again, maybe it's not.
[time=1137] Maybe the reporters need only turn to Romans chapter 15 and read verse 4 to find out the key that unlocks the mystery of this man's life.
[time=1146] Read it with me, will you, for whatever was written in earlier times was written for our instruction,
[time=1153] that through perseverance and the encouragement of the scriptures, we might have hope.
[time=1162] Vincent Foster separated from God, spiritually orphaned, not knowing the love of God and the forgiveness of God
[time=1171] and the power of God within him and the purposes of God to which he could dedicate his life,
[time=1177] comes to a point when he seems to have everything and in reality has nothing and decides to end his own life.
[time=1187] And in many ways, his story is kind of a glaring example of what is happening in our country today.
[time=1194] We're a people in America who really having everything have nothing and we have become co-conspirators in this horrible plight.
[time=1203] For we ourselves at least in the last 30 years have rejected the notion of God, we've declared him dead, we've embraced instead the theory of evolution and really said there's no purpose or meaning to life other than the immediate gratification we can grab from the moment.
[time=1219] And in the last 30 years, suicide rates have been going up at an alarming rate in the United States of America
[time=1225] because people have no hope.
[time=1229] It might interest you to know that in these last 30 years of American history the suicide rate
[time=1235] and the teenagers of America who may be getting hit hardest by this,
[time=1241] the suicide rate has gone up not 50%, not 100%, not 200%, but 300%.
[time=1253] The suicide rate in teens in America up 300%.
[time=1258] The teens of America have more at their fingertips than any other group of teenagers that have ever lived on planet Earth.
[time=1266] They have a discretionary spending power of some $8 billion a year.
[time=1273] If they see it and they want it, they somehow find a way to buy it.
[time=1277] They have educational opportunities that surpass any other group of young people.
[time=1281] They have athletic opportunities and entertainment opportunities, career opportunities, but like Foster and like so many other Americans while they seem to have everything in one respect.
[time=1292] Without God and being spiritually orphaned from Him, they in reality have nothing and they know it.
[time=1302] And one by one, they end their life.
[time=1306] Our family has been having a wonderful week, we were up at Gold Lake Bible Conference just outside of Battle Creek, Michigan, Wednesday through Saturday.
[time=1314] We just returned last night and having a wonderful time ministering the Word of God and being around fellow Christians, it's on a beautiful lake called Gold Lake and my wife and Randy and I ended up out on this lake in a boat.
[time=1328] And it was kind of a cold afternoon and suddenly the boat broke.
[time=1335] Right in the middle of the lake and because of the weather conditions, nobody else was stupid enough, I guess, to be out boating.
[time=1343] And so we were this lonely little boat in the middle of this lake.
[time=1346] We didn't really know what we would do.
[time=1348] Randy suggested that I jump out of the boat and tow the boat to shore.
[time=1354] And I thanked her for that.
[time=1357] And I thought maybe a better plan would be to relax a little bit here and just see if the Lord doesn't bring somebody along that could tow us into shore.
[time=1365] And sure enough, within five or ten minutes, this one lonely little boat began to appear around the corner and it made its way into a nearby cove.
[time=1373] And I stood up in the boat and began to wave, you know, at this person in hopes that they would see me.
[time=1380] And thankfully they did and that little boat began to turn in our direction and there was a wave back from the boat, signify, you know, we got you, we're coming, we'll be happy to help.
[time=1389] And the little boat approaches, it's got two girls in it, two cute little teenage girls.
[time=1395] And they come up next to us and I asked them for a tow back to the Bible conference.
[time=1400] And they're happy to do that but have no idea how.
[time=1402] And so we hooked the rope up.
[time=1404] And just as we're about ready to embark on our little journey, one of the high school girls says, "Now, would you get in the boat with us because we don't know where we're going?" And I said, "Sure." So I jumped in there with them and they were sitting in the two front seats between them and we had a great time.
[time=1420] I found out that their names were Corey and Stacey and we talked about their school.
[time=1425] We found out about the latest movies that they had seen and we talked about their boyfriends and their love life struggles and we were just getting to know each other wonderfully.
[time=1434] And through the whole conversation they were kind of answering my questions but they never looked back at me.
[time=1438] They just kept looking, you know, at where we were going.
[time=1440] And finally I thought to myself, "Well, this would be a good enough time to ask." And so I said, "Tell me.
[time=1446] Do you girls know how to get to heaven?" To which they responded by looking back over their shoulder with this look on their face.
[time=1456] But in all earnestness they said, "No." Kind of like, "But I'd be interested." And so I spent the next 15 minutes.
[time=1466] It was a captive audience, folks. They could go nowhere.
[time=1470] Telling them my best, giving them my best EE presentation.
[time=1475] I took my watch off and I offered them the gift and we went through the whole nine yards.
[time=1478] And it was just a tremendous time and concluded with that idea of receiving a gift.
[time=1483] It's not enough that it's been offered, it's your responsibility and your privilege to take it, put it in your lap, untie the ribbons, open the box and take it to yourself and encourage them to think and ponder and pray about that.
[time=1493] And we just had a wonderful time together and I was thankful then that our boat had broken.
[time=1498] But I couldn't help but think about them in a utterly spiritual orphaned condition.
[time=1504] These little girls didn't even know how to be in relationship to God.
[time=1510] Much less be faithfully pursuing that God.
[time=1512] Much less knowing that He loves them and He cares for them and that He died for them.
[time=1516] Much less having the privilege of coming to a church such as this one on a regular basis to be reaffirmed by other families and other moms and dads and other kids and Bible stories and vacation Bible school and all the rest of the stuff that we call the community of the redeemed.
[time=1531] I picture them as lonely isolated little islands of despair that are having to face an increasingly hostile world
[time=1540] that tell these girls unless they're absolutely gorgeous and brilliant and articulate and capable
[time=1548] that basically they're not worth much of anything at all.
[time=1552] Because that's the only kind of people that are media and that our culture puts on display.
[time=1558] And so they're going to face all the issues of adolescence basically isolated from a God that loves them
[time=1564] and probably from parents who know how to effectively move into their lives.
[time=1568] And it's little wonder why the suicide rate in teens in America skyrockets 300%.
[time=1575] Since we told everybody it was okay not to go to church and not to pursue God and not to have a personal relationship with Christ
[time=1581] and just kind of make it on your own.
[time=1585] Spiritual orphans and our heart breaks for them.
[time=1590] Well Romans 15-4 says there's a place to find hope.
[time=1594] Romans 15-4 says that things have been recorded for us things that happened in earlier times.
[time=1603] They've been written down for our instruction not so that we can answer it correctly on a Bible exam
[time=1609] not so that we can have head knowledge.
[time=1612] What does it say there?
[time=1613] That through perseverance and encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
[time=1620] It's telling us that we can be in relationship with God.
[time=1623] We can know His love and His forgiveness and His ability to pick us up and put us on our feet.
[time=1629] And beyond that we can even look back to earlier times referencing the Old Testament and find the lives portrayed
[time=1637] of those who would have followed God and how God gave them hope.
[time=1641] And I'd like to do that this morning with a particular Old Testament character.
[time=1645] If you come with me to 1 Kings chapter 19 we'll find there a remarkable story of a man who gained hope
[time=1654] who had lost it completely and was on the edge of suicide wishing he too could die.
[time=1661] But God met him and God touched him and God encouraged him and God put him back on his feet and he lived out the rest of his life.
[time=1669] And I hope that no matter where you are this morning whether you are near despair or whether you might be on the other end of the spectrum
[time=1678] that you're full of hope this morning that we'll all find words of encouragement and ways to interact with each other through this text.
[time=1686] It's about a man by the name of Elijah and he was a great and powerful prophet of God.
[time=1693] He lived in a very very difficult time much like our own a day when people were turning away from the knowledge of the true and living God.
[time=1700] They didn't have a president they had a king his name was Ahab and he had violated the law of God and married a woman from the land of Canaan.
[time=1708] And she brought with her the Phoenician religions of Baal and Baal worship and he was a passive husband and he was not a leader and so she had full sway not only in the home but in the nation of Israel that he was called to rule and reign.
[time=1722] And she began to bring in the prophets of Baal and bucket loads hundreds of them at a time who could be transported into the nation of Israel and lead the people in the false religious worship of Baal.
[time=1734] And that wasn't enough she went a step further and decided to exterminate the prophets of God themselves so there would be no competition for Baal worship.
[time=1743] And so hundreds of prophets of God were being destroyed at her hand they were hiding in the caves and finding protection from him.
[time=1753] But God asked Elijah to stand in the gap and so he did.
[time=1760] He went to Ahab and he said God is going to judge you for what you're doing.
[time=1765] And to show you the impending judgment that will come upon you I'm going to bring a plague upon the land of Israel and there shall be no water nor rain for some three three and a half years.
[time=1775] And that's exactly what happened a drought came upon the nation of Israel and Elijah went and hid at the direction of God and the wilderness and God as you remember provided food for him on a daily basis through the ravens who would bring the food and the nourishment for his body
[time=1789] and halfway through that period of time he was then sustained by a widow who herself was starving to death miraculously God provided for him.
[time=1799] The point came when it was time for Elijah to intersect again with Ahab and the people of Israel in a public forum and so in the previous chapter chapter 18 everybody met up on Mount Carmel and the prophets of Baal as you remember were there
[time=1812] and Elijah suggested that we build two altars one that would represent yours to the prophet of Baal the God of Baal and one to my God the Jehovah of the Old Testament and since your God Baal is the captain of fire then will test the gods and see which is the true in living God.
[time=1830] They sacrificed the beasts of offering on each sacrifice or on each altar.
[time=1836] And as you remember the priests ran around there the priests of Baal until they were exhausted they cut themselves and added their own blood to the sacrifice they had made in hopes that somehow Baal would bring fire down from heaven and consume the animal and prove that they were worshiping the true God but nothing occurred.
[time=1852] They finally tired and Elijah tired of it all after many many hours of this gross display and he then took his animal and sacrificed it and placed it upon the altar and brought buckets of water until not only the beast itself was drenched in water but the altar itself and the trench that they had made around it was full of water leaving no doubt
[time=1871] then he called upon God to display his power and to remove forever the question in people's mind that God Jehovah the God of the Bible was the true in living God and fire came from heaven and consume not just the beast but the altar and the stones and the water until there was nothing but the dirt.
[time=1891] Having concluded that great moment of display he sent many of the people out to slay these false prophets to kill these false Baal worship leaders.
[time=1902] And he ran back to the city of Jezreel and Ahab and Jezebel were there and I believe with all my heart that Elijah was going back to Jezreel which was the capital of the nation at that time in the hopes that the people having seen the obvious display and power of God would have taken the castle
[time=1920] by force and throne Ahab out of the kingdom and throne Jezebel out of the kingdom and brought instead a God fearing king who would lead them in the worship of the true and living God but no such action was taken.
[time=1934] I imagine that must have broken Elijah's heart and instead of there being removed he received a threat from Jezebel you can see it in verse 2 of chapter 19.
[time=1945] And then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying so may the gods do to me and even more if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time she threatened his life and for some unknown reason look at verse 4 it scared him to death.
[time=1962] In verse 3 and he was afraid and arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba which belongs to Judah and left his servant there but he himself when a day's journey into the wilderness now lonely and isolated he came and sat down under a juniper tree and requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough.
[time=1987] Lord take my life for I am not better than my fathers.
[time=1993] I want to give you five principles for renewing your hope this morning from the Word of God the first one we're looking at.
[time=1998] The first principle is this remember or realize realize you are not alone.
[time=2005] You feel down and you feel discouraged and you're free falling into the pit of despair and you're tearing yourself up and you're questioning your history with God and you're saying this is pointless.
[time=2018] I'm of no value to God I can't do this anymore.
[time=2025] I want you to remember that you are not the only person who has ever said those words to God.
[time=2030] Elijah has said those words Elijah has said take my life.
[time=2034] In Job chapter 6 Job said those words take my life.
[time=2038] Jonah said them in the fourth chapter of his book God take my life.
[time=2042] Jeremiah said it in Jeremiah 20 the Apostle Paul said it.
[time=2048] He says and don't turn there but 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 8 after long and arduous ministries.
[time=2056] He said for we do not want you to be unaware brother of our affliction which came to us in Asia that we were burdened excessively beyond our strength so that we despaired even of life.
[time=2066] Indeed we had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves.
[time=2072] He was gone he was empty he despaired of life he felt the sentence of death within his own body saying it's enough I'm done I quit I can't do it count me out let me go.
[time=2086] Then he says we put our trust in God who raises the dead who delivered us from a great peril of death and will deliver us he on whom we have set our hope.
[time=2101] You're not alone friends.
[time=2107] You say to yourself oh yeah that's great that's easy for you to say look you're a preacher and you're talking about preachers.
[time=2114] You're talking about Elijah you're talking about Jeremiah you're talking about Jonah you're talking about Paul I'm just a normal average ordinary Christian.
[time=2123] See that's part of the problem Satan's got a hold of you right there you're not just an average ordinary Christian because as you seek to live for God and you struggle to fight and eke out your existence to learn to love your wife and love your kids
[time=2137] and provide a living and create a home and struggle to get here on Sunday morning.
[time=2142] Do you realize the nobility of that do you realize what God feels in his heart as you stand as a part of the company of the redeemed the members of Black Hawk Baptist Church and you struggle and fight to live your life and have a godly family and get here to join us on Sunday morning.
[time=2157] He's just as excited about that in your life as he is about Elijah standing before a heaven saying pal it's over there's a drought.
[time=2167] You see don't tear yourself down don't tell yourself you have no consequence don't say that you have no value to God and don't stand there in your isolation and say I'm the only one in this church who really feels like taking his own life because you're not.
[time=2187] Despair affects children inside the kingdom of God as well as the children outside the kingdom of God and it's when you believe that you are alone in your struggle and when you perpetrate your aloneness that you are at your weakest point look at verse 10.
[time=2203] You remember he said his servant aside and when did the wilderness alone there is a beginning of isolation and then God asked him a question what are you doing here in verse 10 Elijah said I have been very zealous for the Lord the God of hosts for the sons of Israel have forsaken thy covenant torn down thy altars and killed thy prophets and the sword with the sword and then he says and I alone am left and they seek my life to take it away.
[time=2229] Do you hear the desperation of his of his moment he feels all alone he feels isolated there's nobody else that struggles like he struggles there's nobody else that loves God this whole thing is just a wash.
[time=2239] He was totally mistaken if you'll go to verse 18 of the same chapter you'll find there were 7,000 people in Israel whose knees have not bowed to Baal and whose mouth have not kissed him he wasn't alone.
[time=2253] He was telling himself he was alone he was feeling alone he had produced his own isolation and it was about ready to be his undoing.
[time=2264] I was reading this week about Charles hadn't Spurgeon and you remember Charles hadn't Spurgeon one of the greatest preachers that ever lived any preacher would have the ministry of Charles hadn't Spurgeon as a dream come true in his own life the man rocked his sphere of influence.
[time=2281] He preached and thousands would come by the time he was 18 years of age thousands and thousands and thousands of people would come on a regular basis to hear the young man preach.
[time=2290] He had an enormous mind he could sit down with three or four theologies in an evening and devour them and remember everything that was in there and be able to draw upon them in his preaching and bring a relevance to the word of God that was uncommon and unique.
[time=2303] He's remembered throughout the ages as one of the great gifted articulate orders of the word of God.
[time=2311] Might interest you to know that Charles hadn't Spurgeon as close as he was with God struggled severely with depression.
[time=2318] There would be times in his life where he would have to back away from his ministry for up to six months at a time and when he was in the quietness and the solitude of a retreat they had provided for him with only his wife and a few close friends he struggled to grasp on
[time=2332] something that would give him the strength to continue to live.
[time=2336] One quote I'll give you listen to the isolation everywhere there is apathy nobody cares whether that which is preached is true or false.
[time=2348] Now those are pretty broad statements folks everywhere there is apathy nobody cares whether that which is preached is true or false.
[time=2356] He's all alone any they hear him think thousands weren't coming on a regular basis.
[time=2363] Then he goes on a sermon is a sermon whatever the subject only the shorter it is the better.
[time=2371] He kind of chews himself up and berates himself and says the only thing people care about is how short I am.
[time=2377] They're not concerned about the truth they're not concerned about God they don't care about falsehood or truth or they don't care about the content of my message they just want me to be done
[time=2385] and everybody feels that way about me.
[time=2390] Principle number one about finding renewal from despair and depression is the realization that you are not alone.
[time=2400] You stand in good company with great people who are trying to do the work of God and who themselves through the centuries have been brought to this point of absolute despair.
[time=2412] Principle number two and this is so basic but it's here in the text and we'll share it with you.
[time=2418] Principle number two is restore your physical condition restore your physical condition look at verses five through eight
[time=2427] and he lay down and slept under a juniper tree and behold there was an angel touching him and he said to him arise and eat
[time=2435] then he looked and behold there was at his head a bread cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water so he ate and drank and lay down again.
[time=2444] And the angel the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said arise eat because the journey is too great for you.
[time=2452] So he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to horrib the mountain of God.
[time=2459] He's doing God is reviving his physical condition. He's giving him sleep and he's giving him food and he's giving him exercise through this forty day trek.
[time=2469] He's bringing the man's physical condition back from a place of absolute fatigue.
[time=2474] Remember now in the desert for three and a half years having the weight of the nation of Israel upon his shoulders knowing that it was his word that brought the curse of the drought upon them.
[time=2483] Knowing that it was he who stood there in that climactic moment on Mount Carmel and you can imagine the sense of anxiety and the drain that it would have put on his inner person as he confronted the prophets of Baal and saw the miracle of God.
[time=2495] And then from that high point he goes to Jezreel and finds the people really don't want to make any changes.
[time=2500] It was all just kind of a show. It was all just kind of a profession of some type of repentance. They don't take the king out of office and so he hits the very bottom of despair and then he isolates himself from his closest friend and counselor his servant and he finds himself in the wilderness and he's crying out for his own death.
[time=2519] And God just simply moves into his life with the hand of an angel and says here I want you to sleep and I want you to eat and I want you to exercise.
[time=2529] Isn't that funny how when we get under pressure and when our life starts to unravel and things aren't going as they ought to go, some of the first things we're willing to give up is our sleep and our healthy eating habits and our exercise and all we do is compound and multiply the problem
[time=2547] for we take from within the physical strength that we need to cope?
[time=2552] That's basic. You say what? Didn't my mother tell me this when I was six?
[time=2557] You know, three square meals, eight hours a night and get some exercise? Yes, she probably did.
[time=2562] But we are remarkably capable of throwing that advice out the window at the very moment that we needed.
[time=2570] Principle number three. Principle number three comes out of verse eight as well. Look at it.
[time=2575] So he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of the food 40 days and 40 nights to a place called Horob, which then interestingly is said to be what?
[time=2584] The mountain of God. Do you realize that the other name for Horob is Sinai? Mount Sinai? That's why it's called the mountain of God?
[time=2595] Mount Sinai stands about 8,000 feet tall and he's making a 40 day trek across the desert to get back to what we call the mountain of God.
[time=2605] When we were younger and lived in California, we would drive to Colorado to go skiing in the winter and we would make our way across the flatlands and finally there would be the huge, massive, rocky mountains.
[time=2617] And we could see them from 70 miles away and we'd spend the next hour and a half to two hours driving and seeing them get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and huger until they were just mammoth in size.
[time=2630] What's going on here? Why Horob? Why Mount Sinai? Why a 40 day trek to see the mountain of God has yet to spec in the distance and then have to contemplate all that God has done on that mountain in years past?
[time=2644] Remember Exodus 3? That's where God met Moses and said take your shoes off. You're standing on Holy ground and he covenanted with Moses to do great and mighty things for the nation of Israel.
[time=2656] It was on Mount Sinai or Mount Horob and you see Elijah, he would know this better than you and I know this as a prophet of God, as a brilliant scholar of the word of God.
[time=2665] He would have known as he came to the mountain of God that it was Exodus 19. God meets the people of Israel after he's brought them out of the land of Egypt and he ratifies his eternal covenant with them.
[time=2676] And he appears in thunder and lightning and all the earth is shaking there on Mount Sinai. He's drawn all this back in his mind. He's saying oh my goodness.
[time=2686] Principle number three, remember what God has done for you in the past. Remember the faithfulness of God.
[time=2696] Remember the ways in which God has been proven faithful to do what he said he would do.
[time=2705] If you'll read the book of Psalms you'll find many of the psalms and the writer there is at his low point in life and he too is crying out for death and he too has reached a place of despair and he too is ready to throw in the towel and walk away from God.
[time=2718] And his enemies come over him like a flood of waters and somewhere in the psalm and for some reason by the power of God the psalmist begins to shift his perspective and starts to recite the wonders of God to the nation of Israel.
[time=2730] And by the time the psalm concludes the psalmist is reaching an apex of joy and thanksfulness and revived interest in the things of God.
[time=2741] Let me encourage you to do something this week if you're really struggling with despair. I encourage you to invite a friend out, a good friend who knows you and loves you and say can I talk to you for this lunch hour?
[time=2751] Do I listen to me? And then spend that entire time telling them from the moment of your first remembering God to the point of your conversion to all that is transpired in your life to this date and just recount the faithfulness of God in your life.
[time=2765] Take a walk to whore up.
[time=2769] Make your way to Mount Sinai.
[time=2771] Remember the goodness of God.
[time=2774] It'll do your heart good.
[time=2777] Principle number four and this struck me like a ton of bricks this week.
[time=2782] Number four remember the gentleness of God.
[time=2787] Look at verses 11 through 13.
[time=2790] So he said go forth and stand on the mountain before the Lord.
[time=2793] So God puts him up there and puts him in a cave because God's going to meet him there.
[time=2798] God personally now is going to come.
[time=2800] And watch how it happens in verse 11 and behold the Lord was passing by and a great and strong wind was rending the mountains and breaking in pieces the rocks before the Lord.
[time=2810] Mount Sinai has a lot of shale in it and apparently the wind from the presence that God gave was ripping the rocks off the side of the mountain and bursting them into pieces.
[time=2820] So awesome was this great wind.
[time=2823] Hurricane Andrew you know each are hard out this is the power that God brings to Mount Sinai through this great and awesome wind.
[time=2830] But it says in verse 11 but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind and earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire.
[time=2847] And finally after the fire a sound of a gentle blowing the Hebrew could be translated the gentle whisper of God.
[time=2858] I find it so remarkably consistent in my own heart in my own life that when I am at a low point like Elijah and I feel as though I have left my post at least in my heart and I am seeking relief and I am seeking an alternative and I am seeking the release of the pressure
[time=2876] of life.
[time=2879] I expect God to come to me in a great and awesome wind and kind of just blow me away or to shake me from a head to foot in a great earthquake or to kind of come in consuming scorching fire and just kind of sing me with his anger.
[time=2894] You know what he doesn't do that comes to me in gentleness comes to me in quietness the fist never flies.
[time=2906] I think back on my own conversion some 13 years ago driving in a cement truck in the middle of Los Angeles and the spirit of God by the grace of God begins to unfold in my mind the the enslaveness of sin in my life and the the wrong and horrible and despicable and ugly and sinful
[time=2925] and selfish things that have marked my life through childhood and up in the high school and through the beginning years of my college experience and just seeing the dominating influence of sin coming out of my heart and hurting and bruising
[time=2940] and ripping and tearing the people who knew me.
[time=2944] And I really felt worthy of wind that would rip me apart in the earthquake and fire but you know that's not what came that's not what filled a little cockpit of that cement truck.
[time=2954] It was the still voice of God saying I can forgive you for that.
[time=2958] I died to forgive you of that.
[time=2961] I want to pick you up and put you on your feet.
[time=2964] I want to wash away all your sins and I have the power to free you from sin in the future and let you live a life that's worthy and respectable and honest.
[time=2973] I wonder how I would have responded had he come bursting through the door with judgment.
[time=2979] You know it's the way of God, gentleness.
[time=2983] You don't need to turn there but in Ezekiel chapter 34 God is giving a scathing denunciation on spiritual leadership because they have been abrasive.
[time=2992] They have been harsh to the people of Israel. Listen to his description.
[time=2997] Those who are sickly you have not strengthened. The diseased you have not healed.
[time=3002] The broken you have not bound up. The scattered you have not brought back.
[time=3005] Nor have you sought for the lost but with force and with severity you have dominated them.
[time=3011] God removes these people from leadership because it has been with force and severity.
[time=3018] And then God says I will shepherd my people without you. I will do it directly and he describes how he does it.
[time=3024] And later in the chapter he says I will feed my flock and I will lead them to rest.
[time=3029] I will seek the lost. I will bring back the scattered. I will bind up the broken. I will strengthen the sick.
[time=3037] The gentleness of God. That's his heart. That's the way he would shepherd.
[time=3043] And of course we would expect nothing less from the Lord himself who came into this world and shepherded people and cried out to them to rest.
[time=3053] He says in Matthew 11 come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[time=3059] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me. Why? Because I am gentle. And I am humble of heart.
[time=3066] And you shall find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my load is light.
[time=3075] You shall see the gentleness of God. I find in my relationship with my own children.
[time=3082] When my gentleness has found its end and I am out of gas and I am fast moving into the flesh out from underneath the power of the Spirit of God.
[time=3094] And they have pushed me too far. And I move into the mode of harshness and demandingness and I am strict and stern.
[time=3104] You know what I find that produces in them? All the wrong stuff.
[time=3109] They stop using their energy to listen and learn from me and they start using the energy in their life to put up walls and shields to brace themselves against this uncalled fore harshness in the heart of their father.
[time=3123] I find the look in their eyes goes somewhat distant and glassy and in their minds they somehow write this whole thing off and write me off and just back away and oftentimes I will find them moments later in their room alone seeking refuge.
[time=3141] My heart breaks with the understanding of how I would crush them in those moments.
[time=3146] And I find that after those kinds of encounters inevitably we find ourselves back together as I seek them.
[time=3154] And I confess to them my uncalled fore attitude and my harshness and I ask them to forgive me in the hope that we can hang on to relationship.
[time=3165] And that they will not attribute to God what they have seen in me.
[time=3172] I find that when I am gentle with them they are disarmed, they are open, they are vulnerable and they are curious to learn about God and about me and about themselves and about what just happened.
[time=3188] Gentleness seems to be the secret key that unlocks their heart to me and I believe it has the power to expose their own feelings of isolation.
[time=3199] They feel the shame and the guilt of their behavior, they are under the same impact from the Spirit of God as I am and as I am gentle with them it seems to expose their sense of isolation, it seems to draw them back.
[time=3214] So it is with Elijah, God comes in gentleness.
[time=3219] God says I am not in the wind and I am not in the earthquake and I am not in the fire.
[time=3226] I am in a still small voice and I am calling to you because I love gentleness.
[time=3234] I am gentle and my son is gentle and we would shepherd you in gentleness.
[time=3239] But you know when you are at the bottom, when you are full of despair and you are all alone and you violated God and you left your post, there is something about us.
[time=3250] We tend to cower and wait for the fist to fly.
[time=3256] And Elijah teaches us the fist never flies, just open stretched hands, nail pierced hands.
[time=3265] And I died for you and I love you and I have only and always been gentle to you.
[time=3272] So receive it now even when you do not think you deserve it.
[time=3277] Principle number five and I love this part.
[time=3283] Verse 15 and 16, "The Lord said to him, 'Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus.'
[time=3293] And when you have arrived, you shall anoint Hazell, King of Aram and Jehu, the son of Nimashi, you shall anoint him, King over Israel.
[time=3302] And Elijah, you shall anoint as a prophet in your place.
[time=3307] God reaffirms Elijah's place in the kingdom.
[time=3311] God reaffirms to Elijah's heart, I'm going to use you.
[time=3314] I've got things I want to do in your life.
[time=3316] We're going to go places together.
[time=3318] You're not done.
[time=3319] Here are three things I want you to do.
[time=3323] I want you to anoint two kings and I want you thirdly to anoint a prophet to replace yourself so your legacy will go on.
[time=3331] I find that people never really come out of despair.
[time=3334] People never really come out of hopelessness for their own self-interest.
[time=3339] I find that counseling and help that is designed to get people to have hope for themselves always ends in a dead end.
[time=3351] It's when people have been given a sense that they can be used of God,
[time=3357] that God is not done with them, that God has things to do with their life between now and the time they finally die.
[time=3365] That's the stuff of which hope is born because it's bigger than the individual himself.
[time=3372] And we were built to live for things bigger than ourselves.
[time=3381] Five principles.
[time=3383] Realize you're not alone.
[time=3385] You're standing in great company in your despair.
[time=3389] Number two, restore your physical condition so much as is within your power.
[time=3393] Number three, remember how God has worked in your past.
[time=3398] Number four, receive the gentleness of God.
[time=3402] He only has good things for you.
[time=3405] Number five, reaffirm your willingness to serve him.
[time=3410] Well, I know I'm thankful for the encouragement we get from God's Word and these practical matters of our Christian life.
[time=3421] Maybe you have never prayed to receive Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3426] Let me invite you to bow your head and pray this prayer with me now and ask Christ into your heart, repent of your sins and accept him as your Savior.
[time=3435] Father, I know that I am a sinner, that I have violated your law, that I stand guilty before you.
[time=3442] But I thank you for the forgiveness that comes in the person of Christ, for his death and resurrection.
[time=3448] I repent of my sin and seek the love of Christ, inviting him into my heart to save me and committing my life to you.
[time=3457] I pray these things in Christ's name, amen.
[time=3460] If you pray to receive Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, please write us and tell us the nature of that decision.
[time=3466] And we'll send you a little booklet entitled, Lessons on Assurance.
