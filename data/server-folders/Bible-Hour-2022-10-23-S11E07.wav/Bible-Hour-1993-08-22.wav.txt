[time=0] and I've got a feeling that a lot of us are thinking a lot of really positive thoughts
[time=20] about each other, but we don't go the final step and sit the person down and say, "Let
[time=30] me tell you what I think about you, because we're not sure why. We're not sure the importance.
[time=36] In fact, I think we forget."
[time=50] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=56] you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Christianity is not a solo
[time=63] sport. You simply can't make it in Christianity all by yourself. It doesn't work that way.
[time=69] Christians need to be constantly in contact with each other, encouraging each other. Today, Pastor Moore explains what it means to really encourage someone and how you can be an effective
[time=80] encourager. Our special music today will be provided by the Men's Singers Quartet and
[time=90] Joanie King. Let's join our chapel choir as they begin our service.
[time=104] All praise to the men, the reigns of all, and then just face the free. The good is the
[time=122] true. The good is the true. The good is the true. The good is the true. The good is the
[time=300] true.
[time=315] I'm out for that city. God's holy white city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to this
[time=326] city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to this city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to
[time=351] to this city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to this city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to this city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to this city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back
[time=380] to this world anymore. No matter how rough may be the way no matter how rough I stop and
[time=404] may be the way no matter how rough may be the way no matter how rough may be the way no
[time=423] matter how rough I stop and pray. I come to this city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to
[time=437] this world anymore. No matter how rough may be the way no matter how rough I stop and
[time=448] pray I come to this city on that evergreen shore. I am for the promise land. I am for
[time=465] the promise land. I am for the promise land. I come to this city. Yes I am. I'll never turn back to this
[time=493] world anymore. No matter how rough may be the way no matter how rough I stop and pray.
[time=508] Oh yes I'm bound for the city. Oh yes I'm bound for the city. Oh yes I'm bound for the city. Oh yes I'm bound for the city. Oh yes I'm bound for the city. Oh no evergreen shore.
[time=539] Well thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. Carol and I are very thankful that we're back here at Blackhawk Baptist Church. This has been an unusual summer for us. We had a dear friend in the middle of July pass away and then just about a week after that my uncle passed away and we
[time=556] went to California and I had a blessed time with my family as they gathered together some 50 people
[time=563] gathered together to thank the Lord for our salvation and thank the Lord for the life of
[time=569] my uncle Tony and the fact that he is in heaven with our father because the scripture tells us we accept Jesus Christ as our personal Savior. He has gone to prepare mansions for us and I know
[time=580] that my uncle is there and that was a wonderful time to sing songs about the approach to heaven
[time=586] for the Christian and the promise of that eternal life and it was wonderful to see my friends and
[time=592] family again and I'm thankful that we had this opportunity even in spite of the loss of my uncle.
[time=598] It really is a sad time but we look forward to seeing him again when Jesus comes for us.
[time=604] I know that there are many of you that have written to us recently and we thank you for the
[time=610] little notes that you put in on the envelopes of the Bible Hour envelopes because that lets us
[time=616] know that your family is getting along. Some of you have been ill for a number of weeks and you let us know of the progress and we continue to pray for you and we're glad for that.
[time=625] I want to tell you about a special day coming up at Blackhawk Baptist Church that's on September 12th. That's friend day all day. That's a day in which we encourage our people to invite special
[time=637] guests to our church, people that don't normally attend church and if you're one of those people we'd like to give you a special invitation to come on Sunday morning at 9.15 or 10.50 or even on
[time=649] Sunday evening at 6 p.m. Besides the good preaching from our pastor Russell Moore we're going to have
[time=655] a special guest that day. Her name is Robin. Robin's ministries is from Mishawakah, Indiana.
[time=662] She's a graduate of Taylor University and her and her husband Jim will be with us the entire day.
[time=668] I'm so excited about her ministry. I want to take just a moment on our broadcast here to give you a taste of the musical ability of this lady. Let's join her now as she sings for us a
[time=679] portion of How Great Thou Art.
[time=709] I'm sure that was exciting for you. Robin has a
[time=738] four octave range and if you know anything about music if you have about an octave and a half or
[time=745] two octaves you've got a great voice. So we're in for a real treat. She does a variety of music
[time=752] and I hope that you can join us. She'll be singing in Sunday morning here September 12th and then give a full concert in the evening, September 12th at 6 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist
[time=764] Church. So if you've never come and worshiped with us what a perfect day to come on friend day September 12th for our 9 15 10 50 or 6 p.m. service. We'd love to meet you and I hope that you can
[time=777] come and join us today. Now we have a gift offer for you today. It's called What Every Christian
[time=784] Should Know About Growing from Leroy Iams. Now Leroy met a young man in college and the man was
[time=792] a new Christian and he had the opportunity to take him step by step on what it meant to grow as a Christian and he's catalogued everything that he said to his friend in this book and it's an
[time=803] excellent opportunity to go one on one with one of your neighbors or even gather a group of people together and just talk about what every Christian should know about growing in the Lord. I want you
[time=814] to have a copy of this book. You can have it by simply writing to the Bible hour today. That's at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. The book is called What Every
[time=827] Christian Should Know About Growing and you can receive a copy absolutely free by writing to the
[time=833] Bible hour. 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. We work hard to have
[time=845] gift offers that will help you in your spiritual walk with God as well as other people. So I hope that you'll take the opportunity to write us a note. Tell us you're watching. Just this week I had a little difficulty with my car and I have to have it jumped and the man that came just said well I think I watch you on the Bible hour and I said yes I'm glad you watched thank you very much and he helped me with my car and I was grateful. So we love to have the opportunity to get to know you
[time=870] and hear from you. I hope you'll write to us this week.
[time=900] And my deepest part, more than I know myself. So when I face the darkness, when I need to find my
[time=915] home, I'll trust in you shepherd of my heart. Keep her of this heart of mine. Your patience has
[time=933] no end. You've loved me back into your arms time and time again. So if I start to wonder like the
[time=950] land that's gone astray, I'll trust in you shepherd of my heart. You're the beacon of my light. You're the
[time=969] sunlight of my dead. I can rest within your arms. I can know you'll love the morning. Select the
[time=987] old winds below and let the storm rage all around. I'll trust in you shepherd of my heart.
[time=1010] Give her of this life in me or what I'm living for. For all my deepest gratitude you love me even
[time=1028] so as I walk through the valley, missing for my master's home. I'll trust in you shepherd of my heart.
[time=1047] You're the beacon of my light. You're the sunlight of my dead. I can rest within your arms. I can know
[time=1063] you're loving me. So as I walk through the valley, missing for my master's home. I'll trust in you
[time=1080] shepherd of my heart. I'll trust in you shepherd of my heart.
[time=1111] Thank you, Joni. Beautifully done. Well let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and
[time=1123] come with me to Hebrews chapter 10. We're in between book studies as we've finished up the book
[time=1130] of Revelation and waiting to start a new book maybe in the beginning of the fall here in a few weeks and in the interim we're spending some time on some topical studies and God is blessing our hearts as we learn from His Word. This morning as I was beginning my day sitting there at the
[time=1147] breakfast table doing what I do most mornings enjoying an English muffin and a glass of milk.
[time=1152] One of my daughters came out and sat at the table with me. Everybody else was asleep I think and
[time=1159] we were just chit chatting about some things and suddenly she just looked up and said you know dad mom did really really well yesterday and I said really and they had been on one of those
[time=1172] shop tell you drop excursions yesterday at the mall getting ready for the school year to start and
[time=1178] my daughter said oh yeah I'm so proud of mom you know there we were all five of us kids just you
[time=1185] know sometimes we get out of hand and we're touching and pulling and getting in fights with each other and asking for this and want to do this and want to stop over here and all day long you know dad you just been so proud of her she was so patient and so loving and even when she had a discipline us for doing things we shouldn't have done she never lost her temper and just just did a great job and I said to her I said well why don't you tell her that and I'll just boom the
[time=1212] response came back she said well why and I thought hmm I do that too I have a heart full of gratitude
[time=1227] sometimes for people and for the things they do and I've got it all right there in my head but for
[time=1233] some reason I stopped short of telling them that I believe there's real power in letting other
[time=1242] people know how you feel about them what they're doing right how you can encourage them and part of
[time=1248] my belief of that is found in the book of Hebrews what you have here in the book of Hebrews are a group of people who are facing some very difficult circumstances in their life the people here
[time=1260] called the Hebrews were raised in traditional Judaism they were raised under the law they were
[time=1266] raised under the ritual of the sacrificial system and their whole world by virtue of the Old Testament
[time=1273] prescription was mapped out for them they knew when to get up they knew when to go to bed they knew who their friends were they knew their community their social community their religious experience was written out for them in detail but somebody came to them and told them that the
[time=1288] Messiah had come they had never seen Jesus they as the book reports they were not eyewitnesses of
[time=1294] Christ but they learned about Christ from other people who had seen him and this of course is after his death and resurrection some missionaries come to their community probably in present day Greece and tell them about the living Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah has come and many of them turned their
[time=1310] back on Judaism and they accept Christ as their personal Lord and Savior and they move into the realm of grace and salvation through faith and they do well in their newfound faith and they stand
[time=1321] strong for it but with time it becomes difficult for them they become emotionally upset with this
[time=1328] decision because their family disowns them and they are thrown out of the Jewish community and
[time=1334] the the holidays that they remember which came around every year like clockwork and which reinforced them in their life and established them in their community they were no longer to be a part of in fact they were excommunicated from the Jewish community and they were dead to their parents
[time=1349] and so it was difficult for them and then in addition to that there was persecution that was coming upon them because of their newfound faith simply because they were Christians under the governmental system they were being persecuted you can read about that in chapter 10 verse 32 you'll see there it says but remember the former days when after being enlightened you
[time=1368] endured a great conflict of suffering partly by being made a public spectacle through approaches
[time=1376] and tribulations and partly by becoming shares with those who were so treated for you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property
[time=1386] knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one in other words because of their identity with Christ they not only had to give up their family and their former way of life but even in their new life and the new Christian community identify with Christ
[time=1402] they were made to be experiencing social ostracism there was the confiscation of their own property
[time=1408] and in many cases imprisonment and a lot of these converts a lot of these people who had come to
[time=1417] Christ were jettisoning their Christian faith they were rejecting now the message of Christ and they were returning back into Judaism of old or just into full-fledged open worldliness
[time=1431] you say how do you help these people what's the big remedy what's the big solution how are we
[time=1437] going to hold on to these new converts what are we going to do to keep them strong in their faith against all the opposition the answer is found in the same chapter look at chapter 10 verses 23 and
[time=1449] 24 he says let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised
[time=1456] his faithful and he is alluding to what he otherwise explains in the book as these people falling
[time=1462] into apostasy he's saying don't do that hold on to your confession of faith don't waver but how are you going to do that verses 24 and 25 excuse me yes verse 24 and let us consider how to stimulate
[time=1475] one another to love and good deeds not forsaking our own assembling together as is the habit of some
[time=1483] but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day drawing near what these people were
[time=1489] doing was when the difficulty would come and they were struggling emotionally with their faith and
[time=1495] they were considering recanting their faith in Christ they were separating themselves from the
[time=1502] vital fellowship of the believers they were withdrawing from the personal relationships in their life
[time=1509] and they were becoming isolated and in that point they were incredibly vulnerable to eventually just fall into a complete apostasy the solution that the writer of Hebrews brings is stay together
[time=1521] and when you are together look at verse 24 consider the word is to give careful thought
[time=1527] premeditated thought consider how to stimulate the word is provoke or even irritate in the Greek
[time=1536] consider ponder pastulate premeditate how you can provoke and irritate one another to love and good
[time=1545] deeds not forsaking your assembling together the word forsaking not holding back from the other
[time=1552] people what they can get from you and only from you as is the habit of some but encouraging one
[time=1558] another and all the more as you see the day drawing near the dynamic of Christianity the dynamic of
[time=1566] this thing we have begun in our Christian confession of Christ is one which will find opposition we
[time=1576] will encounter opposition and difficulty and trial the vicissitudes of life will come our way
[time=1584] what God is calling us to to be successful in our Christian walk is genuine real consistent fellowship
[time=1592] and encouragement this morning I want to give you three aspects of encouragement three aspects of
[time=1600] biblical encouragement and I hope that you'll make a note of them at least mentally if not on a piece of paper and that you'll consider the people in your world and stop thinking to yourself well why
[time=1612] and start implementing and giving of yourself what only you can give to them three aspects of
[time=1619] encouragement the first one let them know that you believe in them let your wife know let your
[time=1628] children know let your good friend know that you believe in them but let me add a footnote here true
[time=1635] encouragement true words of encouragement must have a basis in reality when there is no basis of
[time=1644] reality for your words of encouragement you know what you call it flattery flattery are the empty
[time=1650] words of overstatement of just saying a bunch of positive stuff about a person that really has no
[time=1657] basis in reality it's just words and the problem with this is the person you're speaking to knows it
[time=1664] they know it quicker than you do that all you're doing is saying positive empty words of flattery it strikes it doesn't strike home and in fact it provokes insecurity when you bring false
[time=1676] compliments into a person's life you don't encourage them you discourage them because you point out what they're not so biblical encouragement vital life giving encouragement inside the Christian
[time=1690] community must find its basis in reality the reality of their life let me give you some reality about the believer one of my favorite verses in the whole bible you don't need to turn there it's Ephesians chapter two verse 10 and you remember verses eight and nine it's all about coming to Christ for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's the gift of God not as a result of works that anyone should boast having said that because you're new
[time=1716] in Christ by the grace of God listen to verse 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ
[time=1725] Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them do you realize the
[time=1734] reality of your life and my life based upon our profession of faith in Christ is that he has taken
[time=1740] our sinful lives our horribly beaten up and misdirected lives and by the grace of God he creates us to
[time=1747] be a masterpiece the word could have been translated as it is workmanship or masterpiece and it draws
[time=1755] the picture its usage in classical Greek was that of a great artist who would sit in front of his
[time=1761] canvas and bring the finest of his work to bear upon the canvas and when he is done he says that's
[time=1767] the best I can do and it is a masterpiece and it is of great value was used of a great musician
[time=1774] for example a violinist who would prepare for months and really an entire lifetime for the great
[time=1780] concert of his life and give there the solo of his life it's a masterpiece it's the best he can possibly do that is the way that God describes you and me after Christ we are the best that he can
[time=1792] do he makes us into a masterpiece for good works for the things which he has prepared from before
[time=1800] the foundation of the world you see there is a reality to our encouragement inside the Christian community when you look at a person when you consider their life with the purpose of reaffirming
[time=1810] the work of God in their life there is reality to your words another of my favorite verses over
[time=1816] in second Peter chapter one verse three it says there that God has given us everything pertaining to life and godliness that's reality everything you need and I need to live our lives successfully
[time=1828] for the cause of Christ God has given it to us and in addition to the spiritual endowments at
[time=1834] salvation there is the power of God Philippians 1 6 says as Paul talks about his effort to build
[time=1841] the Philippian believers he says I'm confident of this very thing that he who began the good work
[time=1848] and you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ in other words it's not just that at salvation you are endowed with spiritual gifts and made into a masterpiece and given everything pertaining to life and godliness but in addition to that God himself infuses his power into your life
[time=1864] he has begun a process he will end the process what I'm trying to say is there is a basis for
[time=1871] encouragement in the life of the believer because of the work of God you and I are in a position to really speak words of healing and health and wholeness into another person's life based upon the reality
[time=1882] of what Christ has done there once you think with me for a minute this morning is there someone in
[time=1889] your life who has been of great encouragement to you could you put a name and a face to the word
[time=1895] encouragement in your life and say this is a person who thick and through thin has touched my life consistently with healing strength life-giving words who has examined my life inspected it closely
[time=1908] and instead of being critical and sarcastic has said the positive things about me that the ways
[time=1915] in which I can be used for God if I hope you have that person some of you are smiling maybe it's
[time=1922] the person sitting next to you I don't know I know for me the first time I remember this particular individuals encouragement in my life I was a senior in high school and I was down in a football field I was on the team there I happened to play quarterback it was a small high school there was no great athletic feat they needed somebody so they stuck me in the spot there we somehow made it into the playoffs we were playing Fillmore and it wasn't a good game for me I hadn't done anything really to contribute to the team we in fact we were losing six to nothing and we were coming to the end of the game and about halftime this certain person left the stands and they came down onto the sidelines and he started whispering four words into the ear hole of my helmet
[time=1961] four simple words you can do it over and over again and I'm intrigued as I think back on this
[time=1971] moment he didn't try to correct the way I was delivering the ball he didn't correct my play selection he didn't correct anything about me he just said you can do it over and over and over
[time=1981] and over in my little ear holes see well about midway through the third quarter they called this
[time=1988] quarterback sneak all I was supposed to do was get a few yards and get a first down but I kind of popped through the middle there and saw some daylight went around the right side and beat the end down the sideline I scored a 78 yard TD run off a quarterback sneak it was big folks people were
[time=2003] clapping in the stand you know I'm saying I come off the feeling he says you can do it you can do it
[time=2013] you can do it we get near the end of the game it's still tied six to six my buddy Mike Handy
[time=2019] right receiver goes down and gets in the end zone I throw this ball over there and he catches it and we win the game the power of encouragement the power of words Proverbs 18 says life and death are in
[time=2035] the power of the tongue do you believe that later this encourager would say to me you are the greatest
[time=2048] son that any father has ever had I don't think that's true but it sure felt good to know that he
[time=2056] thought that over and over and over again he would send the message you are the greatest son any
[time=2062] father has ever had he would say things to me like you realize anything you want to do you can do
[time=2073] endless potential because of a seemingly bottomless pit of confidence and encouragement that was
[time=2080] regularly communicated to me in fact my folks were just with us last week they spent seven days with us we vacationed a little we ministered together a little bit they were in the service here as you remember but I got a call last Tuesday I'm there across the street in my office and I'm working on something and somebody says your dad's on the phone I pick up the line say hi how's it going great time we remember the visit a little bit and then he starts doing it again he starts to weave
[time=2104] into the conversation five or six different things that he had noticed about my life in the last
[time=2111] seven days he says you know I really like the way you did this then he talks about something else
[time=2117] you know by the way I was thinking about this you know that time there's just very precisely very
[time=2125] passionately very consistently very insightfully scrutinizing my life for what I might have done
[time=2133] right I could have been the other way couldn't you bet it could have there were more than seven
[time=2139] things I did wrong when he was here encouragement encouragement contrast that to a good friend of
[time=2150] mine who were very close together and he tells me this he says I can never remember
[time=2156] my father telling me that he loved me I once in my life can I ever remember him
[time=2168] sitting down or in the course of some activity in a meaningful way or in a lightweight
[time=2177] saying he loves me for me it was bedtime over and over again my dad would come in as I was a little
[time=2184] boy and he'd get down on his knees and we'd get face-to-face and we'd talk about things and we'd do this and end up if I was lucky wrestling and rough horsing and extending my my life before I had to go to sleep you know how that is then we'd come to big question the big question
[time=2201] is who loves you more than anybody else in the whole world and I'd say God and I knew that bugged
[time=2208] him he'd say okay okay okay okay okay okay besides God who loves you more I said Jesus
[time=2216] oh yeah okay besides Jesus who loves you more I said mom and then he do what I like so well he
[time=2225] take a hold of my hair see and he started to pull it just a little he said who loves you more than
[time=2232] anybody in the whole world and I tell him somebody else and he pulled a little bit harder see until
[time=2239] I couldn't take it anymore and then I'd say you do he says that's right and don't you ever forget it
[time=2249] hmm life-giving words eh they touch you somewhere deep inside
[time=2255] Wesley Gilder writer for the New York Times said this about the power of words in Washington
[time=2267] no question that the most powerful force in Washington DC is the tongue in the right hands in the right time the strategically placed political rumor is perhaps
[time=2277] the most subtle and lethal weapon in the arsenal of the Washington bureaucrat it is definitely part
[time=2285] of the serious maneuvering and jockeying for power in Washington if you don't think so
[time=2292] just ask Judge Thomas telecasted 60% of the nation at one point was listening to the words of someone
[time=2302] else about his life Morgan Blake who writes for the Atlanta Journal says this
[time=2310] I am more deadly than the screaming shell of a howitzer I win without killing I tear down homes
[time=2318] I break lives I wreck relationships I travel on the wings of the wind no innocence so strong to
[time=2324] intimidate me no purity enough to don't me I have no regard for truth no respect for justice no
[time=2331] money excuse me no mercy for the defenseless my victims are as numerous as the sands of the sea
[time=2339] and often as innocent I never forget and I seldom forgive my name is gossip
[time=2347] you see the same power of the tongue to build and to strengthen and to give life and to breathe
[time=2355] into his soul the encouragement to make it through another difficult day that same tongue has the
[time=2361] power to destroy and to tear and to lash and to rip and to dismantle a person's soul
[time=2367] every time a sarcastic word comes out of my mouth every time a word comes out of my mouth that
[time=2375] does not build people up I want to reach out and grab it but it's too late but I'm left with the reality of how I may be misunderstood or how I may have heard or how I
[time=2386] may have crushed there's power in your words friends there's a whole bunch of people sitting
[time=2393] around you and a whole bunch of people living around you that really need to be touched with the careful thoughtful penetrating words that come out of your lips because you have assessed
[time=2406] their potential for God and based upon the reality of the scriptures and what it says about their life to communicate to that to them say I want to do that can you help me how do I do that I want
[time=2419] to be an encourager how do I do that well I'll give you one small technique that may help think
[time=2426] about your wife for a minute or your husband or your child or someone in your ministry with you and for a moment pretend they have died pretend they are laying there in the coffin
[time=2439] what would you want to say to them what would you want to tell them what was the difference that they made in your life and now that they're gone what's missing I think you'll find your mind is flooded with stuff they need to hear it they need to hear it don't wait until you can't tell
[time=2456] find creative ways to do it but say it to them say it regular
[time=2466] number two number two how else can I encourage somebody how can I build people pray for them pray for them as I read the New Testament I'm finding that the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=2481] spent so much time in prayer he disappeared time and time and time again he broke away from the crowds
[time=2489] he robbed himself of his own sleep and he slipped away into a lonely place where he could pray
[time=2497] and we don't get to see everything about his prayer life but we get some glimpses of it John chapter 17 verse 15 there's a little picture of the prayer life of our Lord he is praying to the Father and he's saying this about his disciples I do not ask you to take them out of the world but
[time=2512] to keep them from the evil one sanctify them in the truth Jesus spent consistent and regular time
[time=2521] lifting up the people he cared about into the throne room of grace and bringing them by name and saying
[time=2527] God as they move through this wicked world the same world that's about to take me to the cross
[time=2535] and take my life as they move through the course of this life orchestrated as it is by the prince of
[time=2542] the power of the air don't take them out of life don't remove them from life as they move through
[time=2549] it God protect them from the evil one and sanctify them by the word of God sanctify purify or make
[time=2556] them holy his prayers went above the circumstances and while I think it's important that we pray
[time=2563] for people's circumstances I think it's important that I pray that God will bring the right men
[time=2569] into my daughter's lives I think it's important that we pray for each other about a job opportunity
[time=2575] or about traveling mercies the circumstances of life are definitely in the arena of prayer
[time=2581] but the prayers that I read about most often in the New Testament go right past the circumstances
[time=2588] to the heart and to the soul and you find the great men of prayer begging on behalf of their
[time=2595] beloved ones that God will sanctify and purify and hold them strong and steady and make them an
[time=2601] effective witness for the cause of Christ look at verse 20 I do not ask in my behalf
[time=2608] excuse me I do not ask him behalf of these alone he's speaking of his disciples I'm not just asking for their benefit but verse 20 says but for those also who believe in me through their
[time=2618] word in other words make them powerful witnesses for the cause of Christ I'm asking for you to hold
[time=2625] them and guard them and keep them safe from the evil one and to sanctify and purify their life
[time=2631] not just for their benefit but because as they do that they will be effective in telling others about Christ so these are prayers of of the great themes of the Word of God personal holiness
[time=2642] effectiveness and personal evangelism there's one other that I like to turn to when I'm praying for people it's over in Ephesians chapter three Paul as you know was the great architect of people
[time=2654] he gave his life building people that he was often found on his knees any book of the
[time=2660] Bible that he has written you will find him making reference to his regular passionate consistent prayer life for those he's investing his life in again we don't get to hear it all but
[time=2670] sometimes we get a glimpse look at it chapter three verse 14 he says this for this reason I bow my knees before the Father I'm down on my knees and before the Father verse 15 from whom
[time=2681] every family in heaven and earth derives its name now here comes request number one that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit
[time=2692] in the inner man here we are again praying right past the circumstances to the inner man the soul
[time=2698] it's a technical phrase in the New Testament that refers to the seat of his thoughts and his desire
[time=2705] and his will and his emotion and Paul is praying that God would give strength and power through
[time=2712] the Holy Spirit to infuse to the inner man the kind of courage and strength to live a godly Christian
[time=2719] life that's praying for people folks that's praying big time for people and then verses 17 and 18
[time=2726] he goes on he has another request so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith
[time=2732] and that you are being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what
[time=2738] is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God what's he praying for he's saying God somehow miraculously or supernaturally infuse them with a special awareness of how much Christ loves
[time=2757] them make that oh make them understand how much he loves them and you and I know that that is the
[time=2766] base from which any operation can start it's when I know that I am thoroughly and completely and unconditionally loved by Christ with all my pimples and bumps and scars and the uglies of my life
[time=2776] but he sees it all and he loves me profoundly and unconditionally out of that kind of sense of self
[time=2782] esteem you can give your life away and so Paul prays strengthen them in the inner man and give
[time=2790] them an overwhelming sense of the love of Christ the first year of my Christian life I was the
[time=2798] beneficiary of such prayer I had just come to Christ as you know I was about 20 years of age and had
[time=2805] been living a horrible life and the Lord saved me graciously in that cement truck and then he
[time=2811] brought this guy by the name of Blaine Gibbs into my life and Blaine Gibbs was my disciple and he was a very busy young man he was finishing his his law school in preparation to be an attorney
[time=2822] he was teaching a large singles bible study in our church he was discipling other people he was
[time=2828] trying to stay physically fit with his exercise program and he found that he did not have enough time to pray for me on a regular basis but he knew my growth he knew my well-being depended at least
[time=2839] in part on his effectiveness in prayer and so he took rather drastic steps he was caught every day
[time=2847] for about 25 minutes on the smog drenched freeways of southern California but he didn't have the
[time=2853] self-control to turn the radio off and spend time in prayer so he got a buddy who knew about that stuff and they took the radio out of his car and then right there on the steering wheel where the horn is he put a 3x5 card there and put my name on it so he could faithfully consistently lift me
[time=2871] up to the throne room of grace you see he knew he knew the life of christ and he knew the life of
[time=2878] Paul he saw that people who build lives effectively for the cause of christ spend a consistent amount of time praying for the great themes of christ in their life well how are you doing are you having
[time=2894] that consistent time of prayer for the people in your life what it be true to say of us today that
[time=2901] we're a praying community and the kind of praying we're doing is for our wives and husbands and children and friends the people in our abf the people we call our christian community are we
[time=2912] down there on our knees and we're begging God that's an important part of the encouragement process
[time=2919] one last one is our time leaves us number one let the know you believe in them number two pray
[time=2930] for them on a regular basis and number three love them love them and i know this is a trite word i
[time=2936] know that it's overused i know that it barely carries any meaning at all in our society anymore
[time=2942] love in many circles has been synonymous with passionate sex and that's not at all what we're
[time=2948] talking about here paul says to some others that he was building his life into he says having thus
[time=2954] a fond affection for you we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of god but also
[time=2960] our own lives because you had become very dear to us he said i didn't just perform my duty i didn't
[time=2967] just do my apostolic duty in your midst and tell you the gospel i gave you my life there was something
[time=2973] inside of me the energy and the passion of my soul was directed at you and you felt it and you know it
[time=2980] last sunday after church i went home and was reading the sunday paper and there saw an article about jimmy johnson you know head coach of the dallas cowboys who four years ago uh couldn't beat their way out of a paper bag with a stick but because of his leadership as of late last year as you know they won the super bowl and our world champions and so now he is the critical catalyst
[time=3001] and all of this they're writing a book about him or he has written a book about himself i'm not sure which and he says in there the secret of my success the secret of my ability to take a group of people
[time=3011] and turned them from their plummet downward in the nfl to rising and soaring to the heights was my ability to tell them to do what was right to be an encourager to reaffirm the right things in their lives he used a couple of examples he says when my tailback is going out in a critical point uh in a football game to run the ball i don't say to him don't fumble because then he goes
[time=3033] on to the field with the message fumble in his head with a negative around it and so now he's
[time=3039] thinking about exactly what i don't want him to do fumble i say to him hang on to the ball
[time=3045] he says to his place kicker at the critical time he doesn't say don't miss
[time=3052] he doesn't leave the guy with this big misword in his head and a negative associated to it he says
[time=3058] make it and so through these and other techniques very powerful man very charismatic very capable
[time=3066] leader he reverses the trend of the Dallas Cowboys and they win the world championship i was interested
[time=3072] to know at the same time in the same article he mentioned the divorce of his wife he mentioned the divorce of his wife and i reflected on previous interviews where he had openly said i have divorced my wife because i can't give her the attention that she needs and the football game
[time=3091] and i said what a tragic loss what a waste of a life here he has this ability to encourage
[time=3099] and transform and make something wonderful out of something that is struggling no doubt his marriage was struggling as he was contemplating divorce but he takes the energy of his life and he sets it
[time=3110] over here to the exclusion of another area that's what i mean by love he is wrongly so but he is
[time=3116] passionately in love and committed to the game of football and he infuses his players with his energy
[time=3122] i can't tell you how many counseling sessions i have had with young married couples there the
[time=3128] third or the fourth year of their marriage and the wife says i don't know what happened but he doesn't love me anymore when we were dating and when we were in that engaged process when we were
[time=3140] kind of getting this whole thing started i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt i was the passion of his heart he loved me the energy of his life was coming at me as a human being but somehow since
[time=3153] we've gotten married in the last year or so it's not that way anymore oh yeah he profuncturally does
[time=3160] his husbandly duties it's not that he's off with some other woman it's it's just that the passion
[time=3166] the longing the commitment the energy of his life doesn't come at me anymore i feel a little bit more
[time=3172] like a checklist you know what a thing on the to-do list and i see his energy going other places
[time=3180] whether it's his work or his hobby but it's not that he shouldn't do those things it's just i'm wondering what happened to me you got to change people love them
[time=3194] let the passion and the energy of your life be directed at them and that may take all kinds
[time=3200] of different expressions and frankly the expressions don't much matter it doesn't matter so much whether
[time=3207] it's Taco Bell or McDonald's it's that you've grabbed a hold of this life and you said i want to spend time with you because i love you not because you're a checklist on my to-do list
[time=3219] do you understand what i'm trying to say i was thinking about the day that i asked
[time=3226] Heidi's parents if i could marry Heidi it's kind of a comic a little scene there around the table on
[time=3232] their patio and i was nervous as anybody would be and i had prepared this marvelous what i thought this marvelous speech of how i'd figured everything out when we would get married how we would pay for how we would not pay for the wedding but how we would pay for our you know existence after marriage and she would go to school here and i would go to school i thought i had all the really important questions resolved in my little speech and that i said you know can i can i can i marry your daughter then i'll never forget Marie's one simple question she said well do you love her
[time=3263] i mean i hadn't said a thing about that it was all this and that the externals of the whole thing
[time=3270] but she knew she said do you love her because that's what really matters the other stuff we can work
[time=3277] that out do you love her boy there's power there
[time=3284] well it's exciting to know isn't it that god has uniquely placed you into your sphere of influence
[time=3295] to build people up and you can do it you can do it you can be used beyond your wildest dreams
[time=3303] to build other people up do three things from your heart believe in them and let them know it
[time=3310] pray for them the way that jesus and paul prayed for people and love them but whatever it is inside of you out and fix it on them i think you'll be surprised
[time=3326] let's pray together father i'm thankful for the word of god and for the way that it gives us such nobility of purpose
[time=3342] i think of a community of people that's effectively doing this and i contrast it in my mind to a
[time=3349] group of unbelievers whether they be on a softball field somewhere or in a
[time=3355] in some other fraternity or association and when you strip the community of these dynamics when you take away from the collection or the assembly of people the dynamics of love and the
[time=3367] power of prayer and the confidence that god is at work you end up with such a mundane existence
[time=3374] and there seems no purpose anymore to go to the gathering why bother
[time=3381] it's just people superficially interacting with people but you give us purpose for our gatherings and there is a divine enablement that comes with it
[time=3393] give us the energy and the desire and the passion to be encouragers for the cause of christ
[time=3401] in jesus name amen
[time=3416] you've been listening to music from our chancellor choir the men's singers and soloist jony king
