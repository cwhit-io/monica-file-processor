[time=0] You know the Lord in this book of Matthew was confronting the Pharisees and he said to
[time=18] them later in this book, Matthew 23, he said to the Pharisees, "You guys spend your life
[time=25] tying up heavy loads and putting them on the shoulders and on the backs of people."
[time=32] And he's talking about the religious external performance that they continued to pile up
[time=39] on top of people so that people never really had a sense of being acceptable to God.
[time=46] They never knew what it meant to experience the fact that the Lord's load is light and that his yoke is easy, they plotted their way through life under the enormous spiritual
[time=58] legalism, and they never came to the end of the week.
[time=64] And could honestly say in their heart, "Man, it feels good to be in relationship with God."
[time=71] I feel at peace, I feel rested, I feel accepted, I feel as though I've done enough, and even
[time=78] if maybe I haven't done enough, I still feel as though I can rest in my relationship with God.
[time=96] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=102] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=105] Thank you for joining us.
[time=107] Jesus said, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest."
[time=114] As you look back over the past week, has your Christian experience been one of rest?
[time=120] Or have you perceived God as a demanding taskmaster, a God whose expectations you never meet,
[time=127] a God who would have had you accomplished just a few more things?
[time=131] Well, today Pastor Moore seeks to remind us that the Christian experience really is one
[time=137] of rest.
[time=138] Our special music today will be provided by Lori Scheiman.
[time=146] Let's join our service.
[time=147] [MUSIC], "I'm in a holy room, fade on onto more, I'm falling down, I'm in a deep promise, a little bit please and rest."
[time=177] Thank you very much for your good singing.
[time=180] We continue with music now as we welcome back Lori Scheiman.
[time=184] Lori has completed one year at Cedarville and traveled with a group of 12 young people called the Swordbearers for 10 weeks this summer in the eastern part of the United States
[time=194] and Canada.
[time=194] We appreciated her as a high school student here at Blackhawk and we continue to appreciate her music that she sings for us today.
[time=203] Let's welcome Lori as she comes and sings.
[time=210] [MUSIC]
[time=229] To God be all glory to Him be all praise from the early dawn of morning to the end of the
[time=238] day.
[time=239] May the words of my mouth and every meditation of my heart be an offering to God be all glory.
[time=256] No it comes from a heart surrendered to praise, living every moment call to always remember
[time=269] His grace, setting us apart to honor Him.
[time=277] To God be all glory to Him be all praise from the early dawn of morning to the end of the
[time=285] day.
[time=286] May the words of my mouth and every meditation of my heart be an offering to God be a glory.
[time=303] Our hope begins with the giver of life knowing He has come His truth.
[time=315] I'll never leave you ever and time, time will prove Him to be faithful.
[time=326] To God be all glory to Him be all praise from the early dawn of the day.
[time=333] The early dawn of morning to the end of the day.
[time=341] May the words of my mouth and every meditation of my heart be an offering to God be all glory
[time=353] to God be all glory to Him be all praise from the early dawn of morning to the end of the
[time=362] day.
[time=363] May the words of my mouth and every meditation of my heart be an offering to God be all glory
[time=377] to God be all glory.
[time=390] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour, I hope you've enjoyed the music, we're thankful that Lori Scheiman, one of our former students at Blackhawk Christian School is home for a few days as I mentioned she's been traveling this summer but we're thankful that she could be here to minister to us and you'll be hearing from her again in a little bit.
[time=407] I want to tell you about a special day.
[time=410] On September 12th it will be Friend Day here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=413] We're going to have a special musical guest that will be here in the Sunday morning services and also give a full concert on Sunday evening at 6 p.m.
[time=422] Her name is Robin.
[time=424] She's a soprano from Mishawaka, Indiana, has a marvelous voice.
[time=428] In fact, as I mentioned last week, if you know anything about music she has a four octave range which is an incredible range, a marvelous voice and I'm going to take a moment and show you her in concert.
[time=440] Just a little clip here to wet your appetite for the ministry that she'll have for us on Sunday September 12th.
[time=453] We shall make the nation take me home. What should we feel like? Let my shell rise.
[time=478] One of my most favorite authors and speakers is Charles Swindall.
[time=506] I have offered a number of books on our broadcast that he has written and he has another one that he has just completed called "The Quest for Character." I remember when I taught the children's choirs we had a song a number of years ago that had the phrase in it, "He's still working on me." This book is about how God just kind of chisels away and hammers and files and smooths out
[time=529] our lives so that we can become more like Christ in his image.
[time=534] It's a great study on how to become more like our Heavenly Father, how to live for him.
[time=540] The title of the book is "The Quest for Character." If you'll send a donation into the Bible Hour today we'd like to send you this book.
[time=547] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana
[time=555] and the zip code is 46815.
[time=559] Once again just send us a donation to help support the Bible Hour and we'll send you this book, "The Quest for Character." You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne,
[time=571] Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=576] This is a book that we gave to our graduates who graduated from high school and college this last spring and as I've looked through it it's helpful for anyone who wants to be more Christ-like, wants to be refined in his spiritual life.
[time=590] So either for yourself or for a friend, you might want to study with a friend together on what it means to be more Christ-like.
[time=598] This book by Charles Swindall will be a great help to you.
[time=601] Well, I hope you'll continue watching the Bible Hour.
[time=604] Our pastor Russell Moore has been preaching on topics, various topics each week and then
[time=611] in just a couple weeks he's going to begin in the book of Philippians.
[time=615] If you have opportunity to read the scriptures, why don't you turn to the book of Philippians and read it in preparation for the messages by our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=625] We're glad you stay tuned today.
[time=626] We go back for more music now.
[time=629] Stay with us, please.
[time=650] [MUSIC - 166 seconds]
[time=840] Well, with Lori's words still in our minds, let me ask you to turn in your Bible to Matthew, chapter 11, and Jesus here in his own words invites you to embrace the cross.
[time=858] He does it with a gentleness and a sensitivity that is very appealing to me.
[time=865] He is here in Matthew 11, verses 28, 29 and 30.
[time=872] Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
[time=880] Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart,
[time=886] and you shall find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy,
[time=893] and my load is light.
[time=898] I want to ask you a question this morning as we begin our study of God's word.
[time=903] Has it felt that way to you this week?
[time=910] In your relationship with God, has it felt like a place of rest?
[time=917] Has it been a light load and has the yoke really been easy?
[time=927] Or do you feel as though your God is more like a task master,
[time=937] who no matter how hard you try, always seems to be suggesting there were a few more things
[time=945] you could have done this week, and the things that you did manage to accomplish
[time=951] were marred in some way by your humanness, and so he might also be saying, and you could have done what you did even a little better.
[time=962] Do you picture him with almost a sense of an irritated face looking down at your life
[time=968] and saying, yeah, you could have done so much more.
[time=976] Is he upset? Is he irritated? Is he unsatisfied?
[time=983] Do his expectations for your life always seem to be just out of reach?
[time=990] So no matter how hard you try, you don't feel as though you can go to bed at the end of a day or a view a week or think back on a summer and say, you know what, I really think that I met the expectations of God.
[time=1005] You know, Jesus later in this book confronting the false religious system of the Pharisees known as legalism.
[time=1012] Said to them, in Matthew, he's 25, I think it is, he said, you know, you guys, you guys take and you bind together heavy loads
[time=1022] as if to say one thing wouldn't be enough, so you bind them together until you get a big group of them
[time=1028] and then you lay them on the backs of the people.
[time=1034] You weigh them down with external requirements.
[time=1037] You rob from them the joy of knowing the rest of salvation, the peace of salvation.
[time=1046] My loak and dee, yoke and dee, is really rather light.
[time=1053] It says over in Romans chapter 5 that we have been justified by faith
[time=1060] and therefore we are at peace with God.
[time=1065] Now that's not just a positional statement about our sins being washed away, that means that in reality we are at peace with God.
[time=1073] Through Christ, all of His demands on our life have been absolutely completely satisfied.
[time=1080] In fact, He isn't irritated and in fact He isn't upset and in fact He isn't frowning and in fact He isn't a taskmaster.
[time=1089] But I look at my own life and oftentimes I counsel with you and I feel like we have little Pharisees running around inside of us and they're whispering into our ears that we're not making it, that we're not cutting it, that we should have done more, that we should have done better, that God is really upset, disappointed, that we can't meet His expectations for our life.
[time=1113] And this morning, I want to try to lift some of the illegitimate guilt,
[time=1120] some of the Phariseeism in our life and even in our church.
[time=1126] I want to try to refresh your heart and remind you of the two things,
[time=1133] the irreducible minimums that God really wants out of you.
[time=1139] I had an interesting experience yesterday after dropping my in-laws off at the airport
[time=1148] and we in reality were sorry to see them go, they had served us so effectively the whole week long, they even sent Heidi and I away for a couple of days, they kept our little brood of children and in our absence they worked in the yard and they cleaned the house and they just did everything you could ever hope or imagine.
[time=1164] But we left them off, we left the airport about 7.30 on our way back and we were all hungry and we had all the kids and Heidi and everybody and we stopped at a McDonald's to get a bite to eat and we walked in there and suddenly at dawn on me I have made a great mistake.
[time=1177] It's hard for me to organize my family to order.
[time=1181] Do you ever feel that way?
[time=1183] You see I have all these people and they have trouble making up their minds and they think they know and they say it and they want to change your mind I sometimes get really irritated in this process and lose my temper with them and I'm normally in a practice of before we pull in the driveway to that restaurant saying now think about what you're going to order.
[time=1202] And please have it ready by the time we make it to the front desk where we'll place our order.
[time=1207] And as I come to the door I'm realizing I haven't done this, I'm wondering how much trouble am I in and then I come to see the individual who's going to take our order and my heart drops with compassion for this poor soul.
[time=1219] Because in this case it's even going to be a little more challenging I'm thinking
[time=1227] because this is one of those unique and lovely and wonderful individuals that McDonald's has a habit of hiring the handicapped.
[time=1236] They're standing in front of us slightly mentally handicapped 24, 25,
[time=1242] 6 foot 2, 24 year old 6 foot 2 height individual.
[time=1247] And I can tell that it's a little different because his head is shaped slightly odd and the hat there's gaps in his hat and his eyes are a little more beady than normal
[time=1258] and his mouth and his tongue and his teeth aren't formed the way that most people's are.
[time=1265] And there's a kind of a movement in the hands that shows you and I think to myself
[time=1271] Lord be with us.
[time=1273] But I want you to know something.
[time=1278] I was so remarkably surprised and moved by the experience.
[time=1284] Because this individual was phenomenal.
[time=1289] In fact I couldn't shake it from my thinking even as I left and as I was at the office last night I wrote down these words as I thought about him, attentive.
[time=1299] He stood there and looked deeply into the eyes of everybody who was trying to give their order or re-give their order and he was 100% there for them.
[time=1310] Never did I get the impression that he wished we could hurry up.
[time=1313] Never did I get the impression that we were irritating him by changing our order.
[time=1319] I noticed that he was very well trained.
[time=1322] I believe, and I don't know all about this individual, but I believe that he was operating at the very outside edge of his envelope with capacity.
[time=1330] But it was obvious to me that the training program at McDonald's, which produces a rather stereotypical person at the desk, which I appreciate, he had learned all of the maneuvers that they had taught him.
[time=1342] He knew exactly what he was doing.
[time=1344] He had taken what they had given him and he was using it to its utmost.
[time=1349] And stood in broad contrast to when we were ordering this breakfast meal and this breakfast meal
[time=1355] he always punched the exact right button.
[time=1357] There was no hesitation in his mind.
[time=1359] He knew where it was and then he waited and looked and listened and asked questions and punched in the next one.
[time=1364] His colleague next to him, who had, to my observation, no handicap whatsoever, had not taken the training course very effectively because she didn't know which button to push
[time=1374] for this particular breakfast order so she turned around and snapped at her manager and said, "Which one am I supposed to push here?" I thought, "My, what a contrast." I noticed, as I have alluded to, he was remarkably patient.
[time=1389] Never a sense of scurrying off, never a sense of distractedness, never a sense of wishing we would be finished or be done with or be over.
[time=1397] I noticed he was remarkably skillful when finally he had placed our order in his little computer.
[time=1403] He then moved with concise, definite patterns back into the array of food that's available,
[time=1410] the drinks and all the rest.
[time=1412] He would pick up exactly what he needed, he'd place it on the tray, he'd go get what else he needed, he never bumped anybody, he never dropped anything, he was never a bother to anybody.
[time=1421] He just did his job with a very high level of skill.
[time=1424] And then there was this one at the end which took me over the edge.
[time=1429] When we had it all there and he read it all back to us and we pretended to know that it was correct.
[time=1435] (Laughter) He then said, "Is there anything else I could help you with?"
[time=1447] And he meant it.
[time=1449] For once in my life, I didn't feel like somebody was asking me to buy something additional to what was already on the plate.
[time=1455] As you know, that's a very common way of getting people to buy anything I can help you with further.
[time=1460] And they don't mean that. They mean, "Please spend more money here." What he meant was, "Is there anything else I could get for you?"
[time=1471] And I was groping for a way to conclude this wonderful experience in my life with this individual.
[time=1478] And I didn't know how to tell him what was in my heart, and so I just looked him in the eyes and I said, "Thank you very much.
[time=1485] You've done a tremendous job." We were leaving after we'd eaten our meal and we were driving on the highway and I couldn't get away from it.
[time=1493] I said, "I'd rather have that guy serve me than any other waiter I've ever had in my whole life."
[time=1503] Because there were two things about him.
[time=1508] He served me with his whole heart, and he served me to the best of his ability.
[time=1517] That it struck something deep within me.
[time=1522] And I believe with all my heart, those are the two irreducible minimums in your Christian experience.
[time=1530] You know what God wants from you?
[time=1534] He wants you to serve him with your whole heart, and by that I mean a true heart.
[time=1541] And he wants you to use what he has given you faithfully for his glory.
[time=1551] If I could go back to that guy, and maybe I will, without embarrassing him or making him feel funny because of his handicap,
[time=1561] I would like to say three things to him.
[time=1564] I would like to tell him that I would choose you.
[time=1567] Of all the people who have ever waited on me and all the restaurants I've ever been in, I would choose you.
[time=1574] Number two, I'd like to tell him that I respect you, because you may never make six figures.
[time=1583] You may never drive a big expensive car, live in a big house, fly on big trips.
[time=1587] You may never have your name written up in the newspaper.
[time=1591] But you know something? You have the secret of life. You've arrived. You have it.
[time=1597] Because you do your job with a whole heart, and you're doing it as best as you can.
[time=1603] And then I'd like to thank him for reminding me of the two most important things in my relationship with God.
[time=1614] God wants my heart, and God wants me to be faithful.
[time=1621] Let's talk about it.
[time=1624] Come with me to 1 Samuel chapter 13.
[time=1627] When we think about a heart for God, if you were to peruse the scripture for a person who is noted as having a heart for God,
[time=1637] we have to go to David.
[time=1642] 1 Samuel chapter 16, did I say?
[time=1646] 1 Samuel 16.
[time=1649] And it stated positively, and it stated negatively, that David is a man after God's own heart.
[time=1657] It stated first in the rejection of one who might have taken the place as king of Israel.
[time=1662] You remember this day, Saul has been king, he's in trouble, he doesn't have a heart for God, and God's going to replace him.
[time=1669] Samuel is the prophet of the day, and so Samuel is sent by God to the house of Jesse.
[time=1673] He has a whole bunch of sons, and Samuel assembles the sons because he knows it's one of these who will be the new king.
[time=1682] In verse 6, chapter 16, it came about when they entered that they looked at Elias and thought, "Surely, the Lord's anointed is before him."
[time=1691] He looked at his appearance and said, "This has got to be the one." Verse 7, "But the Lord sent to Samuel, do not look at his appearance, or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him, for God sees not as man sees, for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."
[time=1716] I'm back a few chapters to chapter 13, and here is Samuel telling Saul that you're finished, and then a replacement has been selected, and the replacement has been selected upon the quality and the character and the disposition of his heart.
[time=1734] For Samuel 13, 13, Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly, you have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God which he commanded you for. Now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
[time=1746] But now your kingdom shall not endure. The Lord has sought out for himself a man after his own heart.
[time=1753] And the Lord has appointed him as ruler over his people because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you."
[time=1759] So negatively and positively, David is said to be the man with a heart after God. David is the one with the super heart, the heart that's fixed, the heart that is fast, the heart that has the things of God heavily upon it so much so it is the criteria for his selection, and it is that for which you remember him in history.
[time=1783] Now here's the encouraging part. Remember who we're talking about here? David.
[time=1790] We're talking about a guy who committed adultery, and a guy who murdered the woman's husband.
[time=1802] In a way we're learning that a man who has a heart after God's heart isn't the perfect man.
[time=1816] It's a heart that even though there's failure, it returns back to God.
[time=1824] I don't think it's a mistake that of all the people's hearts we know about in scripture, we know most about David's.
[time=1829] I don't know why we know most about David's because David wrote 73 of the 150 Psalms.
[time=1835] And the Psalms, that's the book about the heart, that's a book about the emotions, that's a book about the gut, that's a book that gets inside and tells us how we're really experiencing God.
[time=1847] It's funny, isn't it?
[time=1849] The one who is remembered as the one with a heart after God is the same one that God privileged to write most of the Psalms, nearly most of the Psalms.
[time=1858] Come with me for a brief review of David's heart from the Psalms.
[time=1862] I want to show you seven aspects of David's heart.
[time=1866] And I want you to take notes on these scripture passages because I'm hoping that in the quietness of your own life, and when you feel that you need your heart to be put back in order with God, we're going to go to Psalm 38 first.
[time=1881] That you'll look to this list of scriptures, and you'll find in David's heart the kinds of things that should mark your heart.
[time=1893] First of all, we find in David a contrite heart.
[time=1897] It's sensitive to its own sin, and it's willing to confess its own sin.
[time=1902] Psalm 38 O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, and chasten me not in thy burning anger, for thine arrows have sunk deep into me, and thy hand has pressed down on me.
[time=1912] There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation.
[time=1915] There is no health in my bones because of my sin, for my iniquities have gone over my head.
[time=1920] As a heavy burden, they weigh too much for me.
[time=1924] My wounds grow foul and fester because of my folly, I am bit over and greatly bowed down, I go mourning all day long, for my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh, and I am numb and badly crushed.
[time=1939] I groan because of the agitation of my heart.
[time=1942] He wouldn't know what it means to have a heart after God's heart, it's when you have sin, you seem utterly incapable of rationalizing your sin, excusing yourself for your sin, distancing yourself from your sin, becoming hardened to your sin.
[time=1957] You're like David, and it's like deep arrows driving into you, and your flesh is full of indignation, there's no soundness there, there's no health in your bones.
[time=1968] You feel as though your sin is like a flood tide that washes over you.
[time=1973] A man with a heart after God is a man who is willing to be sensitive to the prompting of the Holy Spirit to bring conviction for sin.
[time=1981] And when that conviction is there, there is a willingness to confess the sin.
[time=1986] He says at the end of verse 3, "There is no health in my bones." Why? Because of my sin.
[time=1995] You might turn over to Psalm 51, and that's the classic breaking point of confession in his life.
[time=2001] Listen to him, "Hold up and own up to his own sin." He cries out for the graciousness of God according to God's loving kindness, according to the greatness of thy compassion.
[time=2011] What? Blot out my transgressions, wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, cleanse me from my sin, for I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
[time=2023] Against thee, the only I have sinned and done what is evil in thy sight so that thou art justified without us speak and blameless without us, Judge."
[time=2033] He is welcoming the disciplining hand of God in his life there when he says you're justified when you speak and blameless when you judge.
[time=2040] Not only is he sensitive to the power of the Holy Spirit to convict him of his sin, he can't go on living.
[time=2046] He can't harbor unconfessed sin. It's impossible for him to continue to exist with unconfessed sin in his life.
[time=2053] Secondly, when the Spirit of God does that, he then confesses that sin and then welcomes the disciplining hand of God.
[time=2060] That's what it means to have a contrite heart. David had a contrite heart.
[time=2068] Secondly, David had a humble heart. David had a humble heart. Psalm 39.
[time=2077] If you don't want to follow me and read these passages, that's okay, just write them down and then read them in your quiet time of the Lord.
[time=2087] Listen to this, now, this is one of the most talented men that have ever lived. He is the most successful warrior and king of one of the greatest nations that's ever been on the planet.
[time=2097] He was marvelously gifted in writing as we are evidencing a great poet, a great power with words.
[time=2102] He was a phenomenal musician. He was handsome. He was effective as a leader.
[time=2109] You're talking about a very, very gifted man, but listen to what he says in Psalm 39 verses 4 through 7.
[time=2116] "Lord, make me to know my end, and what is the extent of my days. Let me know how transient I am. Behold, thou hast made my days as hand-breaths, and my lifetime as nothing in thy sight.
[time=2130] Surely every man at his best is a mere breath. Surely every man walks about as a phantom. Surely they make an uproar for nothing amassing riches, and they don't even know who's going to gather them."
[time=2143] This is a man who understands he is a created being. He is a finite being, and he stands in the presence of an infinite holy God, and he says, "God, the most important thing you can give me right now, is a clear impression of how flight he my life is, of what a lightweight I am, of how few days I will actually spend on this planet, and however great a thing I accomplish, it's like nothing."
[time=2167] Remind me of that. Constantly bring that to my conscious level of awareness. I am a zero in the scheme of eternity.
[time=2179] I am but a breath like a vapor. No sooner can it form out of my mouth than I can recognize it than it disappears. That's me. That's my life.
[time=2190] That's a humble heart. Thirdly, come to Psalm 5. He's got a contrite heart. He's got a humble heart, and I love this. He's got a dependent heart.
[time=2204] He's got a dependent heart. David did accomplish great things. David was talented. David was courageous, but listen to what goes on inside of his heart.
[time=2215] Psalm 5, "Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my groaning. He'd the sound of my cry for help.
[time=2224] My King and my God, for to thee do I pray. In the morning, O Lord, thou will hear my voice. In the morning, I will order my prayer to thee and eagerly watch."
[time=2236] This great, successful, powerful individual is finding it needful in the very beginning of the day. Not at the end of the day, but as he sets out on the course of life that's before him, he cries out for help from his heart.
[time=2251] And he says, "God, take all my talents notwithstanding. I'll apply them as faithfully as I can today, but if anything of any value is going to happen today, it's going to happen because you have brought it to pass."
[time=2264] There is no self-sufficiency in this man's heart. There is no sense of autonomy, independence. The John Wayne attitude is long from this man's perspective.
[time=2276] He says, "I'll just read to you in another place." And Psalm 61, he says, "Here my cry, O God, give heed to my prayer. From the end of the earth, I call to thee when my heart is faint, lead me to the rock that is higher than I, for thou has been a refuge for me and a tower of strength against the enemy.
[time=2296] Let me dwell in thy tent forever. Let me take refuge in the strength of my wings."
[time=2303] You know, I recognize that I am in the presence of a very strong man when I hear those kinds of words coming from his heart.
[time=2312] When I hear the dependence of the heart trying for help from God, then I know that I am in the presence of truly great and strong individual.
[time=2323] It's when I hear the pompous, arrogant, self-sufficient noise of a proud heart, of an independent heart that I know I am in the presence of true weakness.
[time=2337] David, it was always that way, it seems. He stood out on the plane facing the great Goliath and said, "You, taunting this huge giant, you come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin."
[time=2350] In other words, you come to me in your own strength. You come to me in the attitude of the day. You know nothing of dependence upon God.
[time=2360] But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel whom you have taunted. This day the Lord will deliver you into my hands.
[time=2369] And I will strike you down, and I will take your head off, all because he trusted and was dependent on God.
[time=2379] Number four, David, had a grateful heart. I love this passage in Psalm 16. Psalm 16 verses 5 and following. David says, "The Lord is the portion and my inheritance and my cup. Thou dost support my lot.
[time=2396] The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Indeed, my heritage is beautiful to me.
[time=2403] I will bless the Lord who has counseled me. Indeed, my mind instructs me in the night. I have set the Lord continually before me because he is at my right hand and I shall not be shaken.
[time=2414] Therefore, my heart is glad and my glory rejoices." This is a grateful heart. This is a man who looks at what he is.
[time=2422] Whatever God has decided for the individual to be, he says, "The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places." That's a throwback to when God was dividing up the nation of Israel to the 12 tribes of Israel when they came through the Exodus experience.
[time=2436] And God was now going to apportion the land. It's a remembrance of how God said, "This tribe will have this piece of property and this tribe will have this piece of property and mind you some property was better than other property."
[time=2450] And what he is saying here is, "The way you have defined my life, who you have made me to be, where you have brought me to live, the friends you have given me, the gifts, the talents, or the lack thereof, the job that I have." God, I'm thankful.
[time=2464] Not because they're the best, but because I have a grateful heart.
[time=2470] I am content to have what you would have me have. That's having a heart after God.
[time=2478] Number five, come forward a couple chapters to chapter 19 and find that David had a teachable heart.
[time=2487] David had a teachable heart, another mark of greatness.
[time=2492] He says in verse 7 of Psalm 19, "The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul, the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, even lightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.
[time=2509] The judgments of the Lord are true. They are righteous altogether. Now listen to his heart. They are more desirable than gold, yes, than much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb."
[time=2522] David was so teachable and so hungry for the truth of the Word of God that he apprised their value more than gold, much fine gold and more than the sweetest commodity they knew of, honey and drippings of the honeycomb.
[time=2538] Psalm 63 tells us that David not only had a hungry heart or a teachable heart, he had a thirsty heart, he had an insatiable appetite for the person of God.
[time=2554] You remember this, David exiled in the wilderness of Judah, seeing there no doubt a panting deer that's near death for lack of water and sustenance. And he grabs ahold of that experience and says in verse 1, "O God thou art my God, I shall seek thee earnestly."
[time=2577] "My soul thirsts for thee, my flesh yearns for thee in a dry and weary land where there is no water."
[time=2584] Verse 6, "When I remember thee on my bed, I meditate on thee in the night watches for thou has been my help, and in the shadow of thy wings I sing for joy."
[time=2593] Here it is, "My soul clings to thee." David was a man who continually brought the thirst of his soul and the thirst of his heart and the thirst of his being back to the only place that could be quenched the person of God.
[time=2612] You say, "Well, I don't know that that's my heart. I thought you were going to try to lighten my load this morning, Russell. You make it heavier because I read these passages and I see his heart and I say, 'That's not my heart.'"
[time=2628] Come with me to Psalm 139. Psalm 139. Listen to David. Listen to him now. He says in verses 23 and 24 of Psalm 139, "Search me, O God, and know my heart. Try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the way everlasting."
[time=2657] Even to have a heart, he knew he was dependent. And the moment you and I look at the heart of David and say to ourselves, "We don't have that kind of heart."
[time=2667] And we open ourselves to God and say, "God, search my heart and know my heart and see if there's any hurtful way in me and lead me in the path of everlasting."
[time=2676] At that moment we have the heart of David. At that very moment we have the heart of David.
[time=2684] If you look at this list and you say, "That's not my heart. Those aren't the consistent patterns of my heart. Those aren't the longings of my heart." And you simply confess it and ask God to change it in your life instantly. That's your heart.
[time=2696] That's the joy of it all. That's the freedom of it all. What God wants is your heart.
[time=2701] Even if it's a beat up mangled, atrophied heart, he just wants that.
[time=2711] The Marines have a tendency of appealing to our sense of exclusivity, and they say to us the Marines are looking for a few good men.
[time=2722] God is looking for a few good hearts. It says in 2 Chronicles 16, 9, "The eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth, that he may support those whose heart is completely his."
[time=2737] You know what that means? God's eyes aren't an active search. They are searching the people of Blackhawk.
[time=2744] The eyes of God are making their way into the hearts of the pastoral staff, and the elders, and the deacons, and the folks in the APFs, and all of us here this morning.
[time=2753] And you know what he's wanting to find? Not your accomplishments, not your credentials, not your business card, not your bank account, not your giving record.
[time=2763] He wants to see a heart that's fixed on him.
[time=2770] That's it. Give him your heart. Give him your heart.
[time=2781] Secondly, I want to talk to you about God's desire for faithfulness.
[time=2787] The first thing he wants from you is an irreducible minimum is your heart. The second thing he wants from you is faithfulness, and this is so liberating.
[time=2795] In 1 Chronicles 4-2 it says this, 1 Corinthians 4-2 it says this, "It is required of stewards to be found faithful."
[time=2805] God wants us to faithfully do the best with what he's given us.
[time=2809] He punctuates the point in Matthew 25 when he's talking about three different slaves of a particular master.
[time=2817] He draws this parable. He tells a story. He wants us to get the point.
[time=2821] And so he tells us about a master with three slaves, and he's going away on a trip, so he gives to the first slave five talents.
[time=2829] To the second slave he gives two, to the third he gives one.
[time=2833] He goes away on his trip, and he comes home sometime later, and he says, "Well, how have you guys done?" And the slave with five talents comes into his presence, and he says, "You had given me five, and I've gained five more."
[time=2846] And the master looks at him and says, "Well done, thou good and what?" Faithful servant.
[time=2856] And then you and I walk in there, and we're the slave with just two talents.
[time=2863] And my tendency is to kind of want to back in the room with God, and kind of look over my shoulder, because I don't have five more.
[time=2870] I only have two more. He gave me two, I only got two, and I want to kind of cower and hide it underneath my shoulder, and say, "Lord, I'm back."
[time=2879] And I got two more talents.
[time=2883] You know what God says in Matthew 25? Through the parable of the master, he says, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant."
[time=2893] You were given two, it's to be expected you would return two, you have done well, you are faithful.
[time=2901] And I love knowing that, because I'm not as gifted as the next guy, and I may not have as many accomplishments as the next guy.
[time=2910] The basis upon which God's being pleased with me has nothing to do with how gifted I am.
[time=2915] It has everything to do with how faithful I have been to what he has given to me.
[time=2921] See, it's no big surprise. I'm never going to be as famous as Martin Luther, or John Calvin, or John MacArthur, or Chuck Swindall.
[time=2932] I'm finding out I'm not even the most famous Russell Moore in the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=2938] Every time I introduce myself, they say, "Transmissions?"
[time=2945] "Hey, what am I?" And I say, "No, I'm the pastor of Blackhawk." And they say, "Oh, yeah, Rick Hox." I say, "No, let's roar!" You see, this is liberating. All I got to be is faithful.
[time=2965] All you've got to be faithful.
[time=2971] And you know what? You're going to get just as big a commendation before the Lord there in 1 Corinthians 3 at the Beamacy as Martin Luther.
[time=2980] He's going to say to you, "Well done!" Now, good and faithful, servant.
[time=2991] You know if we were going to stand up here today and introduce a famous person to you?
[time=2996] If I was going to stand up and say this, "Ah, this morning it's my great privilege to introduce to you a great man of God."
[time=3003] What are you expecting me to say?
[time=3006] You want to hear about how many books, how many radio ministries, how many thousands of people have come to Christ?
[time=3014] I'd like to suggest something to you that has nothing to do with whether or not he is a great man of God or a great person of God.
[time=3023] Those are external things, and his giftedness has no necessary connection to his godliness.
[time=3030] Let me prove it for you. Samson was a very gifted guy, happened to have been the strongest person to ever live.
[time=3036] He got his strength as a gift from God. He was a spiritual pygmy.
[time=3041] King Saul, very gifted guy, big, tall, handsome, charismatic, spiritual pygmy.
[time=3047] Try this one on for a second. Judas Escariot, read Matthew 10.
[time=3051] There he is, grouped with the 12, Jesus doing the big commissioning of the apostles.
[time=3055] He says, "I give you power to cleanse the sick, to raise the dead, to heal the leper."
[time=3061] He got all the same power they did. He wasn't even saved.
[time=3067] There is no connection between giftedness and godliness.
[time=3075] Paul said to the church at Corinth, "You fall behind in no church for gifts."
[time=3081] You're the most gifted church I know of, but you're carnal. You're carnal.
[time=3087] You know what God wants? God wants your faithfulness.
[time=3091] Let him determine how significant the impact is going to be, because that's all of him anyway.
[time=3101] You know what I'm excited about? I'm excited about being there at that beam of seat.
[time=3106] I'm excited about seeing Martin Luther. I want to see it happen. I want to see him evaluate it.
[time=3111] I hope that God just loads the rewards on this guy.
[time=3115] But I'm also really excited about seeing some housewives stand up there right next to him
[time=3121] and watch truckloads of blessings and rewards boom all over their life
[time=3127] and truck drivers and accountants and businessmen.
[time=3133] See, because God is not looking for your accomplishments.
[time=3138] God is going to evaluate you upon your faithfulness.
[time=3146] I hope you feel a little lighter.
[time=3148] You know what God wants from you? Watch your heart. Turn it towards him.
[time=3155] And he wants you to be faithful.
[time=3158] And you know, we look a long way. We can't find very many analogies of this in our world, can we?
[time=3164] Because if we take this same wonderful guy that helped us at McDonald's yesterday and we put him out there on the turf at Notre Dame,
[time=3175] coach is going to look at him and say, "Man, you've got a great heart, kid.
[time=3180] And you're doing the best you can do with what you've got.
[time=3184] But we're not going to give you a green jersey. You're off the team.
[time=3190] You don't make the cut.
[time=3194] We could take this same wonderful kid down there at McDonald's.
[time=3198] We could run him up to Harvard Law School and his professor's going to say, "Hey, you've got a great heart.
[time=3206] And you know what? You're really doing all you can do based upon your ability.
[time=3212] But we can't admit you.
[time=3216] You can't come here." And some of you are facing situations in your life where you're afraid to death that your employer is going to walk through the door and say, "Hey, pal, I know you're doing this with your whole heart.
[time=3231] And I really think you're doing the best you can do, but you're fired."
[time=3237] Isn't it weird? You can't find this stuff anyplace but God.
[time=3242] Let me tell you something. God is never going to say to you.
[time=3247] You're giving me your heart and you're trying your hardest.
[time=3251] You're trying to be faithful with what I've given you, but you're cut.
[time=3256] Now, he's going to say, "Well done. Well done." From the bottom of his heart, he'll say, "Well done.
[time=3266] Without good and faithful servant."
[time=3274] One of the things that additionally convinces me of this beyond even the proof of the Word of God is that when I look at my children, the last thing in the world I'm worried about
[time=3285] is whether or not they're leading perfect lives or whether they're the most gifted kid in the class.
[time=3293] When they make their mistakes, I'm listening for one thing, confession, a heart that's turning back, a grateful heart, a sensitive heart.
[time=3302] And when I feel and sense that heart in them, my heart wants to burst with joy.
[time=3308] When I watch them perform in athletics or in the classroom or whatever arena they find themselves in,
[time=3318] all I need to know is that they're trying their best.
[time=3322] They're being faithful, and my heart bursts with joy. Isn't yours the same way?
[time=3327] That's how God's heart is for you. You are his child.
[time=3331] He wants to know that your heart is with him and that you're being faithful.
[time=3337] Let's pray together.
[time=3344] Father, help strip from our lives the false impressions we have of you,
[time=3351] the scallowing face that we often see when our eyes are closed and we're falling asleep at night and we feel your displeasure instead of your pleasure.
[time=3361] Strip out of our lives the external components of performance and all that stuff.
[time=3369] And let us know your grace, a fresh and a new.
[time=3373] Let us know the peace that we have with you.
[time=3380] And Father, we even pray for the young man in McDonald's.
[time=3384] And God, I don't know where he gets that or why he's that way, but help us to be just like him and even for the opportunity to talk with him about Christ.
[time=3398] Help us, Lord, to convey this kind of unconditional love to those who are in our world.
[time=3404] Help us to treat each other this way and show the character of God
[time=3410] and make us the stronger for it. We pray this in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3426] I want to say a special thank you to Lori Scheiman for ministering to us today in music.
[time=3431] Our message was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3434] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray to our Heavenly Father and ask Jesus to come into your heart.
[time=3444] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for this opportunity to come to you today and to pray personally to you.
[time=3451] I want to ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3455] Come into my heart. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3460] If you made a decision today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
