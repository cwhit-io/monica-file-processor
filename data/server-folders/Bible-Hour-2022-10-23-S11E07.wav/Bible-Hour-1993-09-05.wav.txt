[time=0] I started discipling him and that was about, in a strict discipling relationship, meeting
[time=16] regularly teaching the Word of God, looking at the quality of his life, calling him to higher levels of commitment and ministry involvement for about eight years.
[time=27] Then suddenly it became obvious that we had passed that stage in our relationship and then it was just brother to brother, heart to heart, friend to friend and in many ways he has discipled me, as his heart, that same heart that I met so many years ago in my office
[time=43] has been a challenge to me and it still is to this day.
[time=47] And so in many ways having Kelly here today is a great, great stepping stone in our relationship
[time=53] for me to say to him, will you come and fill my pulpit and let me sit down in the audience
[time=59] and be ministered to as you preach the Word of God.
[time=62] It's all part of that second Timothy two, two thing where you find faithful individuals investing them and then they invest another man.
[time=82] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=88] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=91] Thank you for joining us.
[time=93] Do you ever experience crisis in your day to day life?
[time=96] Do the trials and pressures of life ever rear their head unexpectedly, increasing the
[time=102] tension and turmoil in your soul?
[time=105] Do you ever struggle with conflict in your home, at work or even at church?
[time=110] Of course you do.
[time=111] You're human, sinful and you live in a fallen world.
[time=116] Join us today as Kelly Bird, a former disciple and associate of pastor Moore, fills our pulpit.
[time=122] We'll be looking at Daniel chapter two and we'll be considering a biblical blueprint for crisis management.
[time=130] Our special music today will be provided by Michelle Smankins and Kevin Rowe.
[time=143] Let's join our service.
[time=159] We'll be seeing you in the next video.
[time=369] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=389] This has been an already exciting morning with some good music.
[time=393] We have a special guest as our speaker today, and I want to refer to our pastor, Pastor Russ.
[time=399] He's a good friend of yours.
[time=401] Tell us a little bit about our speaker.
[time=403] Well, it's an exciting day for me Pete, as you know, because Kelly Bird and I have known each other for about 11 years.
[time=411] He came into my office when I was a pastor at Grace Community Church.
[time=415] I was still really in the ministry, a young man myself, and being discipled by other men at that time of my life, and yet this other young man, Kelly Bird, about 6'7", came through
[time=426] my door and said, "You know, I really believe that God wants me to be in the ministry and I want to serve him, but I need help in my own personal life and in my character, and
[time=435] I want you to help me become the man of God that he would have me be." So with fear and trepidation, I agreed to do that.
[time=441] We met on a regular basis, studied the word together, prayed together, played basketball together, and had fun as well, but there was the consistent investment of my life and his life, and the joy of that is he's been so faithful, he's so capable and so gifted
[time=457] and has really desired to grow, and he's done that.
[time=460] Now, as you're a pastor, so that seems, for most people, watching, that's a natural thing
[time=466] to do to disciple someone else and encourage them in spiritual things.
[time=470] How have we been working as a church to relate this to lay people?
[time=475] That's right.
[time=476] I don't think it's only the pastor's responsibility to disciple other people.
[time=480] Now, if you read the New Testament, you'll find the instruction to women is to give their lives to younger women, and the same thing would be true of men whether you're a pastor.
[time=488] And we've had some exciting progression in our church to see that start to catch on and watch the people who are one step ahead of the person behind them turn around and give them a little piece of their faith and love and attention.
[time=499] Well, we certainly are thankful for a number of our lay people who are very faithful not owing to the church, but to the Lord in their ministry and their testimony in the workplace.
[time=509] And that is a thrust that I think is very important in our church, and I'm looking forward to hearing Kelly speak.
[time=516] We've heard so much about him, and I'm sure that that young man is going to do a great job.
[time=522] And speaking of the message, I want to remind you that we have a book called "The Quest for Character." And Kelly Bird's going to speak on that very topic today, it's very timely, and this book is being offered on the Bible Hour, and you can receive it by sending a donation to us.
[time=538] It's an excellent book by Charles Swindall, and just a good study on how God works with
[time=544] the Christian to chisel away at his life, to file it, to sand it down, and to refine
[time=550] it.
[time=551] And certainly all of us need some instruction in that area.
[time=554] So if you'd like to send us a donation today, we'd be glad to send you this book.
[time=558] You can simply request the book "The Quest for Character" by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=570] It's again right to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code
[time=577] is 46815.
[time=579] We go back to the live broadcast now as we hear music from Kevin Rowe, and again it's on the title of God Performing a Miracle in the Christian's Life.
[time=614] I cannot come blind, I relinquish this heart of my life, Lord, I am desperate for your
[time=625] handiwork, I'm ready for the change, look into my heart, give me a heart for you.
[time=638] It was for my joy, you endured the cross, and I am overwhelmed.
[time=646] I want my wheels to turn for you, not for myself, let my eyes be fixed on the hope that
[time=659] cannot fail, may my life be set, where the hammer meets the nail, place my feet, where
[time=674] the rubber meets the road, shake my heart, leave your eyes alone, that I may live my
[time=689] life, where the chisel meets the storm.
[time=700] Fill my mind with images of what you want of me, the path that I must take, lest I lose
[time=715] my way, oh my home is in your sovereignty, my destiny to be faithful before your fist,
[time=729] to serve at the throne of grace, when evil comes to cloud my sight, and lure me away,
[time=742] I will not be distracted from this holy place, let my eyes be fixed on the hope that cannot
[time=756] fail, may my life be set, where the hammer meets the nail, place my feet, where the rubber
[time=770] meets the road, shake my heart, leave for you alone, that I may live my life, where the
[time=789] chisel meets the storm, chip away what tries to hide the truth, until there is a remarkable
[time=808] resemblance of you, let my eyes be fixed on the hope that cannot fail, may my life be
[time=824] set, where the hammer meets the nail, place my feet, where the rubber meets the road,
[time=840] shake my heart, leave your eyes alone, that I may live my life, where the chisel meets
[time=855] the storm, I am all the way.
[time=870] Amen, and I agree, Kevin, thank you, that's a wonderful song, isn't it?
[time=885] Where the hammer meets the nail, where the rubber meets the road, and where the chisel meets the stone, in essence do anything you've got to do to me to make me into the image of Christ, I know that's your prayer.
[time=900] About 11 years ago when I was just recently on staff at Grace Community Church, and as
[time=906] I was being the recipient of a lot of godly men on that staff, investing their life in
[time=912] mine and teaching me about Second Timothy 2-2, where it says to entrust your life to faithful men that they in turn would entrust it to others, this rather large individual walked
[time=923] into my office and shut the door and sat down, and he introduced himself to me as Kelly Bird, and I had heard about Kelly Bird because he was out at the Masters College, 6'7 star
[time=935] basketball player, captain of the team, student body president, and a Bible major, anticipating
[time=941] future ministry for the cause of Christ, and so it was kind of an interesting situation,
[time=947] and he said to me, you know, I really want to serve God, but there are some major holes
[time=954] in my life, there are some things that are missing in my character, and in my perspective
[time=960] about God, and in my private life, and I don't know how to handle them on my own, and he
[time=966] asked me for help, and so for the next eight years we were involved in a discipleship process,
[time=974] where we would meet on a regular basis, we would pray together, we would study the scriptures, and most importantly, we would then take those times and talk about his life and my life, and iron began to sharpen iron, and God has been in the process of, through my efforts
[time=991] and the efforts of many other men and the spirit of God, shaping Kelly Bird into a person that
[time=998] really reflects the character and the heart and the passion of Christ.
[time=1002] He, when working at the Masters College, after he graduated from there and was attending the Masters Seminary, he ran a dorm for us, it was Hotchkiss dorm, and this pretty gorgeous
[time=1014] young freshman girl from Washington came to the college, and she caught his eye, and they
[time=1021] began to build a guiding relationship, and eventually she even lived with us, Kebra,
[time=1027] and lived with us for six months, and so my wife had the opportunity to disciple Kebra, and she got to watch our family in action, and watch Heidi, and they would pray together and study the scriptures, and eventually Kelly and Kebra got married, and Kelly graduated from Seminary, the Masters Seminary, and then we were on staff together at a different church,
[time=1047] Foothill Church, out there in California, and then when I came to serve here at Black
[time=1053] Ock, Kelly went on to a different church, Grace Baptist Church, a church of over several thousand people, where Kelly is an associate pastor there of the college ministry, young marrieds, and the singles ministry, and God is blessing his ministry there, and on many
[time=1069] occasions the senior pastor there, Tom Givens, is out speaking in various places, and Kelly has been a favorite of that family, as he would fill the pulpit in Tom's absence, and
[time=1081] so this morning it's kind of a privilege for me to introduce Kelly to you, and it's a step ahead in our relationship, really.
[time=1089] As about eight years ago it changed from kind of a disciple-disciple relationship to one of just genuine friendship and mutual accountability, and as Kelly's heart continues to challenge
[time=1100] my own to be a person of God, and so I think the disciple-lead disciple thing went away,
[time=1106] and now we're just good friends, but it really is a privilege to be able to open my pulpit to him and to expose him to you, the people that I've grown to love and care for here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1118] And so would you give a warm, Blackhawk Baptist Church welcome to Kelly and his wife, Kebberberg?
[time=1126] Thanks, Bill.
[time=1134] Thank you very much.
[time=1136] Thanks a lot.
[time=1137] So this is Indiana weather, huh?
[time=1139] This is great.
[time=1140] Listen to Russ on the phone, and you think it was always raining and cloudy.
[time=1146] This is beautiful.
[time=1148] Really nice to be here with you folks this morning.
[time=1151] Just wanted to say to you briefly, and I was here last November and was able to share it with a few of you, but wanted to just say to you all publicly this morning, how thankful we are for you.
[time=1161] There's so many people in California that miss and love the Moors so deeply, and to know,
[time=1167] and for me to see here in this family, in this church and ministry, to see how you have welcomed them into your families, to see how you have invited them into this fellowship, to see how you care and love them, care for them and love them, has been so encouraging for Kebber and I.
[time=1181] And I just wanted to say thank you for that.
[time=1183] It means an awful lot to us.
[time=1184] It's a huge encouragement to see them happy and apart.
[time=1187] It's such a wonderful place, like Blackhawk Baptist.
[time=1191] It's great to see Russ and Heidi in the, you can't say Russ and Heidi in the girls anymore.
[time=1195] Russ and Heidi in the girls and Bobby.
[time=1197] So fun to see them.
[time=1198] I've got to tell you a little bit about Russ and Heidi before we jump into our discussion this morning.
[time=1202] It's been an interesting road these last 12, 13 years.
[time=1204] You know, about 12 to 13 years ago, Heidi got pregnant with their first baby and they
[time=1210] were so excited.
[time=1211] Everybody was excited and I think most of the folks prayed for a healthy baby.
[time=1215] But I think there was probably a little bit of just private, very private prayerful thoughts
[time=1223] that it might be a little boy, but God gave him Randy and what a great thing that was.
[time=1228] What a joy Randy was to them and what a joy she's been and she's grown up to be a beautiful baby and lady and you all know that and then a couple of years later, Heidi got pregnant again and I think it kind of moved from the realm of thoughtful, prayerful thoughts to
[time=1242] just personal private prayer on individuals' parts for a boy and God gave him Nikki and
[time=1248] you all know Nikki and how much fun she is and the personality that she brings to that home and the blessing that she has been.
[time=1255] And we were as excited as everyone else and then Heidi got pregnant again and we kind of moved from the realm of thoughtful, private, thoughtful prayer to private individual prayer
[time=1266] and I think with the third one, we kind of went to small group prayer.
[time=1271] Now it was okay to kind of publicly, but in small groups, pray for God's blessing of a young boy more and God gave him Kellyanne and we were excited and they were excited
[time=1281] and again, you know, Kellyanne and her excitement and her smile and again, God blessed them
[time=1288] with her wonderful young lady.
[time=1292] Then Heidi got pregnant again, she's been pregnant an awful lot in our relationship and she got pregnant again and I think at that point, we kind of had gone the gamut and now we were moving into a national prayer chain.
[time=1304] We were calling across the country, inviting people to join us and prayer for a little boy and God gave him Whitney and you know Whitney better than we know Whitney and you know and I've seen in these last few days what an exciting, fun, personable little girl she is and we praise God and thank God as they did for her in her life.
[time=1324] And then Heidi got pregnant again and they're in Indiana and we all just said stop praying.
[time=1330] Don't pray anymore, pray for Russ and Heidi that they'll stop the insanity and I think
[time=1338] God answered that prayer and he gave him Bobby, Robert Russell and that's been so much fun
[time=1347] to see him and to see the girls and him and Russ and Heidi and him and he's so big and
[time=1354] he's so long and thick and you look at his dad and you can't quite figure that out but
[time=1360] you're thankful anyway that he's there and you're thankful for his life and you're thankful for that family I know you are and it's so nice to be able to see them again and again good to be here this morning.
[time=1372] Let me ask you a question if I can as we start our time off here this morning, a question that I've got to believe is I hope it is relevant, I hope it's practical for you I know as I ask myself this question it's a question that I need to ask myself because of the realities of my own life.
[time=1389] How do you deal with crisis?
[time=1393] Be honest, ask yourself this morning.
[time=1396] How do you respond to crisis in your own life in the workplace, at home with family, spouses?
[time=1406] In real pressure settles in and the flame of expectations and responsibilities or maybe
[time=1413] even the unexpected is turned up.
[time=1416] How do you respond?
[time=1417] We all face it don't we?
[time=1419] You face it I face it the things that make life at times very difficult and very challenging.
[time=1426] How do you as a believer deal with crisis?
[time=1429] How do you as a Christian deal with the unexpected in your life in the midst of an unbelieving godless world that at times is watching your every move, your every response?
[time=1440] How do you as a Christian tend to respond in crisis, in difficulty and in trial?
[time=1447] Ask yourself again this morning if you would.
[time=1449] Are you too often in the midst of crisis, too often quick to speak?
[time=1455] Maybe too often at times to want to go and just do your own thing, to fix the thing, to get it out of your life, to get it out of your way, to go and do your own thing, to
[time=1466] remove it from your existence.
[time=1468] Are you too often easily irritated in the midst of crisis, personal turmoil?
[time=1475] Do you find yourself at times increasingly self-centered?
[time=1479] Do you find yourself at times prone to panic?
[time=1483] And what do you do with the Lord in the midst of crisis?
[time=1487] What happens there in your relationship with Him?
[time=1490] Where does that go?
[time=1491] How does that work in the midst of the unexpected crisis of our life?
[time=1496] Well in your humanness and in your fallenness and in your sinfulness, if you're anything like me, you would answer yes to all of the above.
[time=1506] And at our best, maybe several of the things just mentioned.
[time=1511] And I know I can speak for myself and I would guess again I can speak for you that in the area of handling and grappling with crisis and the unexpected in our life we need a lot
[time=1521] of help.
[time=1522] I know I do.
[time=1524] And in light of that need for help in my life, I'm encouraged about our passage this morning.
[time=1528] If you've got your bibles open with me to Daniel chapter 2.
[time=1533] Daniel chapter 2 verses 17 to 49.
[time=1537] I'm encouraged about our passage this morning because in it we see Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, modeling powerfully for you and I, a mature,
[time=1549] strong, godly approach to crisis.
[time=1554] We see them as young teenagers.
[time=1555] Many scholars put their age at anywhere between 13 and 15 years old.
[time=1560] These are young boys.
[time=1563] These are young 14 year old boys functioning in a far off land, living under the tyrannical rule of a godless king and in the midst of it all, evidencing a level of character
[time=1574] and integrity and commitment that is astounding not to mention convicting.
[time=1580] Real briefly, let's just get some background and look at chapter 1, I'm sorry, just flip back a page and let's just make sure we understand where we find these four young men as we come to chapter 2.
[time=1590] It says there in verse 1 of Daniel chapter 1, "In the third year of the reign of Jehoia Kim, King of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and besieged it." And the Lord gave Jehoia Kim, King of Judah, into his hand along with some of the vessels
[time=1606] of the house of God.
[time=1608] And he brought them Nebuchadnezzar to the land of Sheinar, to the house of his God and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his God.
[time=1616] Then the king ordered Aspenas, the chief of his officials, to bring in some of the sons
[time=1623] of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles.
[time=1627] Stop there, let me just talk us through the rest.
[time=1629] Nebuchadnezzar comes in and takes Jehoia Kim, takes vessels from the temple, and brings
[time=1635] them back to Babylon 13 to 1500 miles away.
[time=1640] And along with that, he brings it says young men and it goes on in these next few verses to talk about how he wanted for himself and for his service and for his benefit and for
[time=1650] his palace and for his court.
[time=1652] He wanted young men, it says they were the best looking young men, the finest young men, the most talented, the most gifted, and he takes these kids and he kidnaps them.
[time=1662] He takes them hostage, away from their family, away from their friends, away from their home
[time=1668] and he takes them to Babylon, where he does what?
[time=1672] He changes their names.
[time=1675] He teaches them a new language.
[time=1677] He teaches them new customs.
[time=1679] He teaches them new literature.
[time=1681] He attempts to completely change who they are so that they will no longer serve their
[time=1687] God, but that they would serve him and be loyal to him and give themselves to him.
[time=1694] If you've studied the book of Daniel, if you've read through the story, especially in these first few chapters, you know that that did not work, that these young men stood strong.
[time=1704] They stood firm on the foundation that had been laid for them.
[time=1707] They changed their names.
[time=1709] They learned a new language.
[time=1711] They took on new customs, but they refused to compromise who they were, Babylonian brainwashing
[time=1718] as he attempted to thrust it upon them did not work in the end.
[time=1724] So let's look back now.
[time=1726] Chapter 2, we're going to try our best to make it through verses 17 to 49 and we're going to just call it character.
[time=1732] Character in the midst of crisis.
[time=1735] How does Daniel respond?
[time=1736] I want you to note and we'll try and look at three things this morning.
[time=1740] Three responses that Daniel has to crisis and I want to again just set it up briefly by going back to verse 12 and reading through verse 16.
[time=1749] Chapter 2, "Because of this the king became indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon." So the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them and that doesn't mean they were looking for Daniel and his friends so they could go and kill the wise men.
[time=1768] What it means in the Hebrew as you look at that is that Daniel and his friends would be killed as well.
[time=1774] They were going to be slain.
[time=1775] Nebuchadnezzar was furious and so they're all going to die.
[time=1779] Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Ariak, the captain of the king's bodyguard
[time=1786] who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
[time=1790] He answered and said to Ariak the king's commander, "For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent that Ariak informed Daniel about the matter?" So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him time in order that he might declare the interpretation to the king.
[time=1809] So Nebuchadnezzar's had a dream.
[time=1810] It's been very confusing for him.
[time=1812] He can't understand it.
[time=1813] He doesn't even know what he dreamed really, doesn't know what to make of it and he wants his magicians and his conjurers and the guys in his court, the wise men, to come in and tell him what he dreamed and to interpret the dream for him and nobody can do it.
[time=1827] And he's furious.
[time=1828] He's angry.
[time=1829] He wants them all killed and Daniel finds out, Daniel calmly requests time to do what?
[time=1836] Did you read it there?
[time=1838] To declare the interpretation.
[time=1840] Note, he doesn't say, "Give me time so I can figure this thing out on my own.
[time=1845] Give me some time so I can go and make this interpretation myself." He doesn't say that.
[time=1851] He doesn't say that because he knows better at age 13 or 14 or 15.
[time=1856] He knows and understands fully that the source of direction and wisdom in the midst of crisis is not himself and with that we come to our first point.
[time=1866] The first stop on the path to maturity in the midst of crisis.
[time=1870] Look and see if you can see it there in verses 17 and 18 of Daniel chapter 2.
[time=1877] When Daniel, it says, went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the matter, in order that they might request compassion from the God of heaven
[time=1889] concerning this mystery so that Daniel and his friends might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
[time=1898] Did you see it?
[time=1901] The first step in the middle of life-threatening, serious crisis.
[time=1905] What was the first thing that came to their mind?
[time=1908] What was the first thing that they did?
[time=1911] They prayed.
[time=1916] And you say to me, Kelly, is that it?
[time=1919] That's her first point.
[time=1920] They prayed.
[time=1925] The very first thing, the very first attitude, the very first act was to get down on their
[time=1932] knees and ask God for help, for assistance, for direction.
[time=1939] The first thing wasn't to rush off and find the newest book on crazed kings and their dreams.
[time=1946] Wasn't where they went.
[time=1947] The very first thing wasn't to huddle together, together their own perspectives on the matter.
[time=1953] The very first thing they did was not to run and consult the experts on what it all meant.
[time=1959] It wasn't even to come together and form an escape plan if things got crazy.
[time=1964] Not that there would be anything wrong with them or you and I going in the midst of crisis and reading a book, not that there would be anything wrong with consulting the experts or talking amongst ourselves for the sake of gathering perspective.
[time=1977] But what's the first thing that they did?
[time=1983] They got on their knees and prayed and asked for God's help, for His wisdom and His discernment.
[time=1989] That's the first thing typically that you do.
[time=1993] Ask yourself this morning.
[time=1994] What is the first thing in the midst of real crisis that you typically do?
[time=1999] More importantly, maybe what attitude do you typically initially evidence when things get
[time=2006] a little bit crazy?
[time=2010] Do words like irritated, angry, tense, frustrated, bothered, shut down, withdrawn, selfish?
[time=2029] Words like that come to your mind.
[time=2032] They do mind.
[time=2034] I have to admit to you, those are the words, those are the attitudes that more often than not come to my mind when I think about what my initial response is to crisis.
[time=2046] Wouldn't it be nice if our response, and I ask myself, and maybe you do too, why is
[time=2052] it that way?
[time=2053] Why isn't it trusting?
[time=2056] Why don't words like that come to my mind?
[time=2058] Why isn't it dependent?
[time=2060] Why isn't it faithful?
[time=2061] Why isn't it giving?
[time=2065] And the best answer I can come up with is that I think at the core of who you are and who I am, in our again, in our fallenness, we want so desperately to have people, relationships,
[time=2078] husbands, wives, children, friends, and situations.
[time=2083] We want so desperately for them to be what we want them to be.
[time=2087] What they maybe should be, but we want so deeply for things in our life to be the way we want them to be, and when crisis comes into our life, when the unexpected happens,
[time=2098] when turmoil and conflict rear their head, we lose what?
[time=2106] Control of it all, and boy, we don't like that.
[time=2109] You don't like that.
[time=2112] And so we fight and we scrap and we claw to get it back.
[time=2117] And we aren't trusting and we aren't dependent and we aren't faithful.
[time=2122] We are irritated, angry, bothered, frustrated, shut down.
[time=2129] Daniel evidence is here a deep trust, a deep reliance on God in the face of trial that
[time=2135] should be a challenge to each of us.
[time=2138] Have you experienced crisis in your life recently?
[time=2144] Do you anticipate one soon?
[time=2147] Sometimes we can see him coming, can't we?
[time=2150] Sometimes we can't.
[time=2152] Maybe you're here this morning in the midst of one.
[time=2155] Maybe you're here this morning sitting in your seat and you're smiling and singing, but on the inside you're hurting and you're frustrated and you're confused and crisis has engulfed your life.
[time=2169] How willing do you find yourself to initially in attitude and act?
[time=2173] Take the issue and thoroughly, genuinely give it over to the Lord in wholehearted trust
[time=2179] and dependence.
[time=2180] And it's sad, I think, for me, I'll speak for myself that something so vital and something
[time=2186] so foundational to what God has said, something so important to your life in mind, prayer,
[time=2192] has become sometimes in our circles, something so simple and so trite and so taken for granted.
[time=2200] I say my first point is prayer in the news day and I even say to myself, "That's it.
[time=2205] That's it." And that's powerful.
[time=2208] That's meaningful.
[time=2210] And it represents a path, I believe, we need to be willing to walk initially and attitude and act that we would give our needs and our desires to God, not just once, but in an ongoing
[time=2221] pattern.
[time=2222] Well, as Daniel responded in this way, what happened?
[time=2225] What was the result of him praying?
[time=2227] Look at verse 19 through verse 23, "Then the mystery it says was revealed to Daniel in
[time=2233] a night vision and Daniel blessed the God of heaven, Daniel answered and he said, 'Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever for wisdom and power belong to him and it was he and it is he who changes the times and the epochs.
[time=2247] He removes kings and establishes kings.
[time=2249] He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.
[time=2253] It is he who reveals the profound and hidden things.
[time=2258] He knows what is in the darkness and the light dwells with him to the oh God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise for thou hast given me wisdom and power.
[time=2267] Even now thou hast made known to me what we requested of thee for thou hast made known to us the king's matter.'" Sound like you're 14 year olds prayer?
[time=2279] What a kid, huh?
[time=2281] What a hard for God and what a perspective.
[time=2284] In this particular situation, now watch this.
[time=2287] In this case God answers immediately and specifically exactly what Daniel had petitioned.
[time=2295] He honors Daniel's prayerful attitude by specifically answering Daniel's petition.
[time=2301] Now am I the only one in the room this morning that wishes God worked like this in the midst
[time=2308] of prayer more often?
[time=2310] Am I alone in that?
[time=2312] I don't think so.
[time=2313] You would love it if God was always very faithful and quick to answer in a timely fashion, specifically
[time=2319] what we requested.
[time=2321] And that's great that it happened for Daniel, saved his life.
[time=2325] God bless him in that fashion.
[time=2326] But you know what?
[time=2327] It's not the point and I don't want you to walk away with the fact that he prayed and God answered it.
[time=2331] I want you to walk away this morning with the fact that he prayed, that he was willing to initially in attitude and act, take a posture and a position of prayer.
[time=2343] Answer is great but not key to what we're trying to communicate.
[time=2346] You think of Abraham in the Old Testament, he wanted so desperately to have a what?
[time=2353] A son, a little boy, God had promised him that.
[time=2355] Do you think in his 99 years prior to having the boy that think he ever prayed for a son?
[time=2363] I bet he did.
[time=2364] I would have.
[time=2365] I bet he prayed for a son and God said no, not now, not at this time, not at this place.
[time=2371] But he was willing to pray, I bet.
[time=2372] You think about Jesus, we know he prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane, the night he was
[time=2378] going to be betrayed.
[time=2379] He prayed a prayer.
[time=2381] Remember what he said?
[time=2382] Remember what he asked for?
[time=2384] That if it would be within the parameters of God's will, that the torment and the torture and the pain and the suffering would somehow maybe be able to pass from him and what did God say?
[time=2394] No.
[time=2395] God doesn't always answer prayers like this.
[time=2399] You know that and I know that, but there has to be.
[time=2401] There needs to be a willingness in your heart and mind to respond in that fashion.
[time=2408] Back to Daniel's response in crisis, number one, he prayed.
[time=2412] Number two, look at verse 24 of chapter two, says therefore Daniel, he's received this
[time=2418] from the Lord and Daniel went into Ariakum, the king had appointed to destroy the wise
[time=2424] men of Babylon.
[time=2426] He went and spoke to him as follows, first thing out of Daniel's mouth since his life has now been saved, first thing, do not destroy the wise men of Babylon.
[time=2439] Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon.
[time=2444] I would suggest to you this morning that the second thing we see in Daniel's life as he responds to crisis is that he remained others centered.
[time=2453] He remained others centered.
[time=2455] I'll tell you what, when crisis or turmoil hits my life, guess who tends to be the first
[time=2462] individual I think about?
[time=2466] Can you answer for me?
[time=2468] Me, myself.
[time=2470] And here are the questions that I tend to ask in the midst of my crisis.
[time=2476] How will this crisis affect me?
[time=2480] What will this crisis do to my plans and my desires and what I want to have happen?
[time=2488] How can I minimize the discomfort in the midst of this to me personally?
[time=2496] As a young seminary student, I wrote down a quote one day, I cannot for the life of me remember what professors said it, but it impacted me.
[time=2504] And I scribbled it down fast and I've kept it for years.
[time=2508] And he was talking about measuring and gauging real character and when you and I should really
[time=2514] do that with someone.
[time=2516] And he said this, "To gauge and measure the true character and compassion of a man, observe
[time=2523] him not at times of personal ease or when life flows as it has been planned, but instead
[time=2531] view and evaluate him when things and plans have gone awry when the unexpected and unwanted
[time=2537] complications have trashed his plans and forced him to deal afresh with the people and circumstances
[time=2545] around him." That's a good quote.
[time=2551] And it says a lot to me and I hope it says a lot to you about where it really matters in your life and mind.
[time=2557] So you don't judge your character or mind or rustles or anyone that you know, you never judge an individual's character by what they do in public, by what they do when life is good.
[time=2568] You judge and see the true character of a man and a woman by what they do in private and
[time=2575] by how they handle themselves in the midst of real conflict and crisis.
[time=2580] Daniel does a great job of modeling for you and I others-centered thinking.
[time=2587] I myself, I don't do such a great job.
[time=2591] I don't know what you all do in Fort Wayne for the 4th of July.
[time=2595] I don't know if there's any big traditions or things that you enjoy as a family.
[time=2599] But boy, we really enjoy, and this is going to sound so cliche.
[time=2603] We enjoy going to the beach in California on the 4th of July.
[time=2607] My wife and I have several families, some friends, seven, eight couples.
[time=2611] We always go to the beach on 4th of July, been doing it for years.
[time=2614] And we get our tents out, camp at the campsite, enjoy the beach for the three or four days, whatever it is, and just have a great time.
[time=2622] This year we got invited to go again and we accepted Deborah's little sisters were visiting from Washington State where she grew up and it fell on a weekend.
[time=2630] So I had church responsibilities that I had to be a part of.
[time=2634] So what I did was thinking it would be fun for them and enjoyable for her, I said, "You know what?
[time=2640] Why don't we bar a truck from some friends?" And I said, "Why don't we pack up the girls and you and get all the food and all the tents and all that stuff?" And why don't you guys just go down to the beach early and have a great time and just enjoy yourself.
[time=2653] And I'll keep, oh, I didn't tell you, we've got an 18 month old little boy named Russell.
[time=2660] And he doesn't look anything like this Russell, but he's an awesome little guy and we love
[time=2666] him a lot and we named him after Russell.
[time=2668] And anyway, I'll keep Russell, I said.
[time=2673] And I thought that was very sensitive of me.
[time=2677] And she said, "Great." And so she just did a great job.
[time=2680] She got the truck packed, I helped maybe a little bit, and she got the truck packed, got the girls packed, got the food packed, got everything in the truck.
[time=2688] She got directions for her down to San Clemente State Beach, and, you know, she's from Washington
[time=2694] State, you know, kind of back roads, country kind of thing.
[time=2696] So it doesn't always do really well in LA on the freeways, but she did a bang up job.
[time=2702] Got him down there, got the tents put up, got the food unpacked, got the girls all settled, and just did a phenomenal job.
[time=2710] And I was back at home with Russell, little Russell.
[time=2713] We were having a good time.
[time=2714] He and I get along great anytime.
[time=2717] This is the truth, anytime I spend a prolonged period of time with him, my respected admiration for my wife increases.
[time=2724] And he and I had a great time, a little rough, little rocky at times, but we did well to
[time=2730] get through the week.
[time=2731] And then Sunday came, went to church, and then he and I were off to the beach.
[time=2736] And even though we did well during the week, and I think by Sunday afternoon now we're cruising to the beach, I think he's a little bit tired of me.
[time=2743] And I'll be honest, I was a little tired of him.
[time=2747] And he starts to cry with about 45 minutes to go, and he's just not, he's not hungry,
[time=2753] he's not hurt.
[time=2754] You know how they get, they just, he's just tired, he just wants to get out of the stupid seat, and the sage is driving along, and he starts to cry and crying, crying, get louder and louder, and he's cranky and fussy.
[time=2765] I'm cranky and fussy, and I'm starting to think, and here's what's going on in my head.
[time=2771] I can't wait to get to the beach.
[time=2775] And I'll just be honest.
[time=2776] I can't wait to not hear this anymore.
[time=2779] I can't wait, I'm looking forward to seeing my wife, granted, but I can't wait to get in the ocean and body surf and boogie board.
[time=2787] I can't wait to get in the sand.
[time=2788] I can't wait to have my turkey sandwich and my snapple.
[time=2791] I can't wait to sit in my lounge chair and be done with this weekend.
[time=2797] And so I drove faster.
[time=2799] And he cried louder.
[time=2800] And we finally got to the exit to San Clemente off the Interstate 5 there.
[time=2805] He pulled off, and then it hit me, something else.
[time=2808] I'm realizing, because we've done this so often, that there's a very tricky thing about to happen.
[time=2812] I'm about to approach the guard booth with the ranger.
[time=2815] And it's going to be very important to my plan, that Kebra had thought ahead, because
[time=2823] she knows I don't carry cash, and she knows the way it works there, that you need a day pass to park in the parking lot that allows you just to park and get right down to the beach.
[time=2834] And I'm banking on the fact that she knows that if she doesn't do that, I get a 15 minute pass with strict instructions to go to a different lot where I have to walk further to the trail,
[time=2846] which is three-quarters of a mile down to the beach, where 18 million people are for that weekend.
[time=2851] Find her somehow, get six bucks from her walk back up to the car, go back to the booth.
[time=2855] I don't want to do that.
[time=2857] It's not inviting to me at all.
[time=2859] He's crying louder.
[time=2861] I want out.
[time=2862] He had better come through.
[time=2865] Drive up to the thing.
[time=2866] Nine cars.
[time=2867] We wait there for 20 minutes while he cries and does this in the car seat.
[time=2871] And we finally get there.
[time=2872] And I ask the inevitable question, and I get the inevitable answer.
[time=2877] Sorry, Mr. Bird.
[time=2879] No day pass here, rips off the tag, tapes that I'm from my window, that'll be a 15 minute.
[time=2884] I said, I understand why I was gone.
[time=2887] I was man, bothered, sinfully bothered, drove over to the 15 minute deal.
[time=2894] He's doing this.
[time=2895] I'm trying to get his bathing suit on him.
[time=2897] I'm trying to get the sunscreen on him, because she'll ask, could you put sunscreen on him, and I'll say yes.
[time=2903] Trying to get the towels out of the back, trying to, trying, I'm, I'm getting changed in the car, tinted windows down below the steering wheel.
[time=2910] He's looking at me like, what are you doing?
[time=2911] I'm picking him up.
[time=2912] I'm grabbing the towels.
[time=2913] We're a mess.
[time=2914] And we're walking down, there's the trail, three-quarters of a mile down.
[time=2917] I'm almost straight down.
[time=2918] I'm slipping.
[time=2920] I'm angry.
[time=2923] And I'm thinking to myself, you had better.
[time=2926] Be careful.
[time=2928] And we make it down to the beach.
[time=2929] I see you all smiling.
[time=2931] You've all been there.
[time=2932] You mean not to the beach, but.
[time=2935] And I look down the beach, and there everybody is.
[time=2937] I made it.
[time=2938] There's all my friends.
[time=2939] The day tents are up, the kids are playing, they're out in the waves.
[time=2943] There's my beautiful, lovely wife, her little sisters.
[time=2946] And they are racing toward me.
[time=2948] They're so happy to see me.
[time=2950] And we embrace briefly.
[time=2954] And she says, hello.
[time=2958] And the first thing out of my mouth isn't, boy, it's good to see you.
[time=2967] I'm so, come here.
[time=2969] I'm so proud of you.
[time=2971] You did a great job.
[time=2973] You're here.
[time=2974] I saw the tents.
[time=2975] They're up.
[time=2976] You got down here on your own.
[time=2980] You've done great with the girls.
[time=2981] I'm so glad.
[time=2982] I'm so happy to see you.
[time=2983] And I'm so proud of what you've accomplished, not anything close.
[time=2988] The first thing out of my mouth, and I don't say it to be funny, was, gosh, it didn't do
[time=2996] the parking thing real well.
[time=3001] Their countenance and her face just dropped.
[time=3007] And guys you've been there, you know, when you lose eye contact and you're not quite sure where they went, well, I knew where she'd gone.
[time=3016] And she just kind of kicked at the sand.
[time=3019] She took Russell from me.
[time=3020] She gave him to her sister.
[time=3023] And without looking at me, she said, you know what?
[time=3026] Why don't you just go play?
[time=3029] Have fun and go ahead and do your thing.
[time=3032] She reached in the diaper bag and she pulled out the keys to the car.
[time=3036] She walked down the beach.
[time=3038] She walked.
[time=3039] And I let her do it.
[time=3040] Another bad move.
[time=3042] Up the trail, down the car, got in the car, drove to the booth, paid the six bucks, the
[time=3048] car back, down the trail, down the beach.
[time=3052] Says an awful lot about my wife, but I'm very happy to share with you.
[time=3058] Says an awful lot about me that is embarrassing.
[time=3064] I didn't handle my crisis very well.
[time=3067] Maybe you don't either when it comes to remaining others centered in your life, in the midst of real difficulty.
[time=3074] I hope I can grow and mature.
[time=3077] After receiving the interpretation of the dream and having his prayer answered powerfully, not to mention timely, did you notice the first thing out of his mouth?
[time=3087] You say, Ariak, I've got it.
[time=3089] I figured it out.
[time=3090] I'm saved.
[time=3091] My crisis is over.
[time=3093] Is that what he said?
[time=3097] No.
[time=3098] You say, Ariak, take me to the king.
[time=3100] That was the second thing he said, but the first thing out of his mouth was don't kill the wise men.
[time=3105] What about them?
[time=3106] Are they going to be okay?
[time=3109] In the midst of crisis, he remained others centered.
[time=3112] Reminds of anybody in the Bible, any key, focal figure.
[time=3117] Reminds me of Jesus.
[time=3119] Reminds me of Jesus on the cross, when in the midst of a crisis that you or I will never
[time=3125] identify with, in the midst of pain and suffering that you and I will never come close to.
[time=3131] He said, "Father, wipe these idiots off the face of the earth.
[time=3134] They've hurt me." Did he say that?
[time=3138] He didn't, did he?
[time=3140] He said, "Father, forgive these people, these poor, dear, clueless people.
[time=3144] They have no idea what they're doing, forgive them, be there for them.
[time=3150] God help us, you and I to be more willing to forgo our rights and let go of our demand
[time=3156] that life or people be exactly like we want them to be." One more thing and we're going to close.
[time=3163] I want you to notice number three, in the midst of crisis, Daniel looks for and takes
[time=3169] opportunity to shift the thought and focus to the Lord.
[time=3179] Look at verses 25 to 28, "Then Ariak hurriedly brought Daniel into the king's presence and
[time=3185] spoke to him as follows.
[time=3187] I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known to the king.
[time=3193] The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belta Shazar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?" And here it is, verse 27, "Daniel answered before the king and said, 'As for the mystery
[time=3209] about which the king has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians, nor diviners are able to declare it to the king, however.'" Verse 28, "There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar
[time=3225] what will take place in the latter days.
[time=3228] This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed.
[time=3232] It's not me, Nebuchadnezzar.
[time=3233] I didn't come up with this, the God in heaven who knows all and tells all and who has full and complete control of everything.
[time=3240] He knows what you dreamed and he has helped me make this interpretation."
[time=3246] Bold, brave.
[time=3249] In the midst of crisis, you and I typically look for two things, I think, personally, two
[time=3256] things in the midst of real dilemma, a way out or if we're going to have to be in it, we look for the path of what?
[time=3264] Least resistance, again look at Daniel.
[time=3267] You think he'd just be happy to be alive.
[time=3270] You think he'd just be happy to be saved from the sword, but no, he's going to inject
[time=3276] into the situation.
[time=3278] He's going to share with this crazy king at age 13, 1500 miles away from home, having
[time=3284] just escaped death.
[time=3286] He's looking for and taking the opportunity not to get out safe or avoid further conflict, but he's taking the opportunity to shift the thought and focus to the one true God.
[time=3296] I wish I had those kind of guts.
[time=3298] I wish that were me more often.
[time=3300] How about you?
[time=3302] In the workplace with the unbelieving community that you know and have befriended, I hope,
[time=3308] in some ways, with those in your family that don't know God, that don't know Christ,
[time=3316] friends of yours, how prepared are you, how willing are you, how ready are you to respond
[time=3325] in light of what it says in 1 Peter 3.15, to be ready to make a defense to everyone who
[time=3331] asks you to, to give an account for the hope that is within you with gentleness and with
[time=3338] reverence.
[time=3340] I have no idea what you're facing this morning.
[time=3344] I have no idea the circumstances of your life that talk to the gentleman after the first service whose life is coming unraveled, working seven days a week, 15 hours a day, frustrated
[time=3356] at home.
[time=3357] My wife's frustrated, his kids are frustrated, and he's telling me, you know what, at least
[time=3363] this is encouraging.
[time=3364] I feel like I've got some things I can pursue.
[time=3367] And I could somewhat identify with him and I bet most of you can too, in some way, in some area of your life, it would be my prayer this morning that you would have the courage
[time=3378] and the integrity and maybe more than anything, the honesty, to truthfully go to God and say,
[time=3385] God, I need your help.
[time=3387] I need your assistance.
[time=3388] I need your direction.
[time=3390] To in the midst of trying to pursue that path, not forget the people in your life.
[time=3397] And at the same time, when given the right circumstance and opportunity to not forget God, to be able to, when given the chance, talk about Him, refer to Him, and let others
[time=3407] know of your trust and relationship with Him.
[time=3411] Let's pray.
[time=3412] Well, I hope that you found the music inspiring as you listened to soloist Michelle Smeckens
[time=3420] and Kevin Rold.
[time=3421] The message today was from our special guest, Kelly Bird.
[time=3425] Kelly is an associate pastor at the Grace Baptist Church in Newhall, California.
[time=3429] If as a result of his message or this program, you've made a decision to trust Jesus Christ
[time=3435] as your personal Savior, you can take a minute right now and pray this prayer with me.
[time=3440] Let's bow together.
[time=3442] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm going to tell you today that I'm sorry for the sins that I've committed, and I'm thankful that you died on the cross to take care of my sins.
[time=3451] I ask you to forgive me for the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3456] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3459] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
