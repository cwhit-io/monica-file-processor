[time=20] How could you be truly happy if you're poor in spirit?
[time=26] If you're full of grief?
[time=28] How could you be truly happy if you're gentle and you give up your rights and you're the opposite of being a selfish person?
[time=34] Wouldn't you get run over?
[time=36] Wouldn't you be taking advantage of how could you truly be happy?

[time=52] >> Welcome to "The Bible Hour," an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=61] Thank you for joining us.
[time=62] Can anyone be truly happy?
[time=65] In a day of broken families, crime, a failing education system.
[time=69] Can anyone be truly happy?
[time=71] Jesus has given us His nine-point list of prerequisites of being happy.
[time=76] Today, we look at the first one.
[time=78] Happy are the poor in spirit.
[time=80] Our music today will be provided by our special guest, Robin Hipschman.
[time=85] Let's join our sanctuary choir and orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=93] [MUSIC]
[time=117] >> I feel my voice singing to you, Lord, I try creation in its own.
[time=130] I feel the melody, the song you gave to me, full of your majesty,
[time=140] your proud and glory, and Lord, I sing your light and praise,
[time=152] the glorious virtues raise.
[time=155] I come before you singing, with singing, praise live for what you've done,
[time=165] for Jesus Christ your son.
[time=168] I feel the air with music with music of your friends.
[time=181] Your glory fills my very need, Lord, an energy that brings forth praise.
[time=194] And so I bless you, me, no worship is my aim, my sovereign life will play.
[time=204] In my heart you shall reign, Lord, I sing your mighty praise,
[time=215] the glorious virtues raise, I come before you singing, with singing, praise live for what you've done,
[time=229] for Jesus Christ your son.
[time=232] I feel the air with music with music of your friends.
[time=241] I sing your mighty praise, the glorious virtues raise,

[time=302] joined with the choir and orchestra in singing.
[time=304] We appreciate your participation in worshiping in that way.
[time=308] We also appreciate the ministry of Robin who you've already heard today, and we'll hear a couple more times in this service and then we'll join us for our evening service.
[time=318] What a privilege it is to have her here.
[time=320] I'm delighted that she was at Blackhawk about 18 years ago.
[time=324] I'm told we didn't know that until she came this morning and is back with us to minister in music.
[time=329] She has a great heart for music, a beautiful voice to serve the Lord, and please welcome where she comes back to the platform to sing for us.
[time=348] Precious Lord, take my hand, leave me alone.

[time=794] [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=961] [AMEN] The problem is stated in a variety of different ways, but if you listen closely to casual conversation, you can usually pick up a recognizable theme.
[time=979] Jim just hasn't found himself yet.
[time=984] Becky, well, she seems to be restless again.
[time=991] Frank has, again, filled his life with so many different people
[time=999] and so many different activities, and he just seems to be running at a breakneck speed, and he's never able to stop and think about his own life, and he runs so hard and so fast, even to the neglect of his own wife and his kids.
[time=1017] Becky seems to have done it again.
[time=1020] She's been kind of depressed lately, and so she does what she normally does when she's depressed.
[time=1025] She goes to the mall and just sees things and buys things more close than she ever needs, and as you know, the credit card debt has already been a problem for her, but she just can't say no, and in which she gets home, she feels worse that she's overspent, and so she tends to eat again far too much.
[time=1044] Well, Steve, yeah, he's having a pre-midlife crisis.
[time=1048] Dave is having a midlife crisis, and John, he's having a post-midlife crisis.
[time=1055] The theme is that somehow, some way, I will be able to satisfy myself.
[time=1064] It's the myth or the erodious belief that we carry around in our hearts that somehow I can do this.
[time=1073] There's something I can do, or there's something I can own, or there's some person I can have, or there's some place that I could just go to, and once I get there, or once I have that person, or that thing, or that I've accomplished that certain task, see, then I'll be really truly happy.
[time=1091] Then I'll be satisfied.
[time=1097] Well, it's an interesting thing.
[time=1099] If you read the recent edition of Time Magazine, there is in their article entitled, "The Most Happy Nation," and its subtitled contentment is pretty hard to find anywhere you go these days, or so say a variety of international pollsters.
[time=1115] They give us information about the French saying that 72% of them are less happy today than they were 10 years ago, and 60% of them are predicting that things will get worse in the future, not better.
[time=1128] The pollsters tell us that the people in Germany, though, enjoying remarkable productivity these days, and a higher level of personal income than in the past, only a third of them could admit to being "very happy."
[time=1143] The British, a half of them indicate that they feel their country is snobbish, a class-centered society, and they would like to leave there if they knew how, or could.
[time=1155] And the Russians, interestingly enough, 63% of them are sorry that the Soviet Union collapsed.
[time=1165] And 72% believe that life under capitalism is even more wretched
[time=1171] than it was under communism.
[time=1175] Interestingly enough, the article didn't survey, or give indication that it surveyed the United States of America.
[time=1181] We might just do that from our own seats today.
[time=1184] Are we a happy people?
[time=1186] Do you find the people you work with and to find the people that are on your block and that you have extracurricular activities?
[time=1192] Are they truly, genuinely happy, content people?
[time=1196] Maybe even survey yourself this morning.
[time=1198] Are you a happy person?
[time=1200] Can you honestly say that in the depth of your soul, there's a genuine sense of happiness?
[time=1210] Well, in that same article in time, this last issue, reported that the UN once formulated a 12-point list of prerequisites for being truly happy.
[time=1224] The list read this way.
[time=1226] You've got to have at least one radio.
[time=1230] You need a bicycle.
[time=1233] You need a complete set of kitchen utensils.
[time=1237] And then I got disappointed because the article didn't list the remaining nine.
[time=1241] And I, like you, would be intrigued to know what it was.
[time=1247] But I want to suggest that there is another list than the one that the UN presented
[time=1253] as far as prerequisites to being happy.
[time=1255] It is a list that is much older than the one they published and much better known.
[time=1260] It is a list that really has nine prerequisites, not 12.
[time=1266] And this list was given to us, not by the UN, but by God.
[time=1271] You see, he's very concerned that we are a happy group of people.
[time=1275] He's intimately concerned about your happiness and your state of blessedness and that you would have a sense of satisfaction in your life and with your life.
[time=1283] The list can be found in Matthew chapter five, and if you have a Bible, I invite you to turn there.
[time=1288] If you don't have one, I encourage you to look next door on the lap of a neighbor there.
[time=1294] There's a list of nine prerequisites to being truly happy, to being content.
[time=1300] We won't talk about all of them this morning, but at least let me list them for you.
[time=1305] It begins in verse three, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." Now the word blessed, just another word for happy.
[time=1310] Happy are the poor in spirit.
[time=1312] Verse four, "Happy are those who mourn." Happy are the gentle.
[time=1319] Happy are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[time=1323] Happy are the merciful.
[time=1326] Happy are the pure in heart.
[time=1329] Happy are the peacemakers.
[time=1331] Verse 10, "Happy are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness." Verse 11, "Happy are you when men cast insults at you and persecute you."
[time=1343] And you look at that list and you think, wow, that's kind of a weird list.
[time=1348] I mean, how in the world has somebody supposed to be happy, they don't talk about wealth, they don't talk about income, they don't talk about homes, it doesn't list cars, it doesn't list trips, it doesn't list what environment you live in, it doesn't talk about personal accomplishments, stature, a presence, degrees.
[time=1365] I mean, what kind of list is this?
[time=1367] How can you present this as a list that would lead to happiness?
[time=1370] It seems devoid of the things that we would normally think of.
[time=1374] I guess my response to that is, man, I kind of like that, that's almost refreshing.
[time=1378] Because I've tried some of those other things, maybe you have too, maybe we live in a world that's committed to trying to find happiness through some of the things or through some of the people or even through some of the possessions and personal accomplishments.
[time=1393] And again, as has already been noted through several different sources, that doesn't produce happiness.
[time=1399] And so I'm thankful that the list is free of those kinds of things because it would only be yet another disappointment in my life to come to yet another list that promises happiness and say, no, no, no, you see, it's the same stuff all over again just in a different order.
[time=1412] It's just people, possessions, and circumstances.
[time=1415] And I personally am absolutely convinced that those do not produce true happiness.
[time=1423] So I come to this list with a sense of freedom.
[time=1427] You see, it was the Lord Himself who said, Jesus Christ said that life does not consist in your possessions even if you have an abundance of them.
[time=1438] I have an idea.
[time=1439] He was reading the Old Testament and he came across the life of a man, a king actually, of a very famous nation at that time, a guy by the name of Solomon.
[time=1447] Solomon was very successful as a leader and he acquired things and circumstances and people for himself.
[time=1453] In fact, it says there in the Bible if you were to read about his account, that he had so much gold and so many jewels that silver became as common as an everyday stone that would be on the ground in the capital city of his country, Jerusalem.
[time=1467] This man had fleets of ships that would travel and traverse the globe and bring back for him the precious and fine things and be involved in commerce and trade and it made him fabulously wealthy.
[time=1479] With his wealth, he would acquire the kind of the status figure of the day, not cars and airplanes, but horses.
[time=1486] And he would bring the finest horse flesh from all around the world.
[time=1490] He had thousands of them. He built stables for them, kept them immaculate.
[time=1494] And then he wasn't going to be without women, so he also sent his ships out
[time=1500] and with his trading prowess brought some of the world's most beautiful women of all different shape, size and color from the far reaches of the globe and he housed them in his concubines and would frequent it as often as he chose.
[time=1514] He was also personally known.
[time=1519] He had a personal reputation for his greatness, for his brilliance.
[time=1522] He was given the gift of wisdom and it produced all of this wealth.
[time=1525] And so not only was he rich, it wasn't like he inherited it.
[time=1528] It wasn't like somebody else produced it.
[time=1530] He produced it and he was known for having produced it and so he had fame all around the world.
[time=1535] I mean, okay, now there it is. If that's not the list of stuff that you would expect to find in your wildest dreams to produce happiness, I don't know what it is, but he wrote this king in his own words that it was empty.
[time=1548] He used an old-fashioned word named vanity, which connotes that it didn't bring anything to me.
[time=1553] It didn't substantially change well, maybe for a while.
[time=1556] We know about that. You get a brand new car, it has that aroma of a brand new car aroma and you think to yourself, "Man, if only my friends could see me now." The problem is your friends eventually do see you in your car and they get used to you in that car and you get used to you in that car and then the nice smell goes away and then if you live in Indiana, it rusts.
[time=1575] You know what I mean? Here's this list.
[time=1580] Jesus is saying, "My friends, let me help you understand something about happiness." It doesn't come through the people and it doesn't come through the possessions and it doesn't come through the circumstances.
[time=1590] He even used a word for happiness in this passage, macarias in the Greek.
[time=1596] It was the word that the Greek writers used to describe the happy state of their gods.
[time=1602] You know, Greek mythology. You see, people were longing and seeking for a kind of happiness that wouldn't wear out, that wouldn't last for just such a short season.
[time=1611] And so they called, they invented their gods, these gods of Greek mythology and they attributed to them the kind of happiness they really knew they were built for and wanted for themselves.
[time=1620] It was an inner happiness and it came from within the gods themselves.
[time=1624] They were not dependent upon circumstances, people or things.
[time=1627] And so they ascribed to them this thing that they knew they wanted in their own heart but couldn't have.
[time=1633] Or at least so they thought.
[time=1635] That's the kind of happiness that is being described in this list.
[time=1638] If you want that kind of happiness, a happiness that comes inside, then he says, read my list, contemplate these thoughts and find real happiness.
[time=1654] Real joy, real contentment.
[time=1658] The secret of it is this.
[time=1663] What the Lord lays out here, what Jesus lays out here in his list of nine prerequisites to happiness,
[time=1671] are the beginning and the establishing and the continuing of a relationship with God, being right with God.
[time=1684] And he knew that that is where that inner blessedness is found.
[time=1692] Now look at it, we'll look at just the first one there.
[time=1695] Today, blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=1698] For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1701] Blessed are the happy, truly, genuinely, intrinsically happy are the poor in spirit.
[time=1705] And you say, no, that sounds like a contradiction in terms.
[time=1708] How can you be happy in spirit and poor in spirit?
[time=1712] Well, first let me say this to you.
[time=1714] It doesn't say blessed are the poor.
[time=1717] It doesn't say that.
[time=1719] And a lot of people through the ages have tried to tell us that if we were just poor, I mean financially poor, if we could just divest ourselves of all earthly things, then we would be happy, like the monastic movement of centuries gone by, where those guys just got rid of everything, barely had clothing on their back, disappeared from society and lived up in a cave and said that they were happy.
[time=1741] And in reality, they weren't.
[time=1742] That is not what Christ is saying, produces true happiness.
[time=1746] It's not the getting rid of all the possessions of your life.
[time=1750] And I think as we're discovering this morning, happiness has very little to do with whether you have something or don't have something, because we're in search here of a happiness that impacts my inner soul.
[time=1761] He also doesn't say happy are the depressed when some poor in spirit.
[time=1765] And they think, oh, okay, so I'm really happy if my shoulders are slumped and my head is hanging and my eyes have no glitter of life in them, and I just walk around and somehow this is some kind of new vogue, Savoy Fair Happiness.
[time=1777] It's not what he's saying.
[time=1779] You say, what is he saying?
[time=1781] What is he saying? What is a poor?
[time=1783] What does it mean to be poor in spirit?
[time=1786] The answer to the question comes in the notion of understanding that we are spiritually poor, poor in spirit, poor spiritually.
[time=1795] We are spiritually bankrupt.
[time=1797] We understand that there is nothing in us or about our life that has spiritual merit in the eyes of God.
[time=1806] We are spiritually bankrupt.
[time=1810] You say to yourself, wow, I don't know. Am I that?
[time=1813] Is that how I think about myself? If I were to value it myself, would I say that I view myself as being spiritually bankrupt in the eyes of God?
[time=1820] Well, let me give you a question that may help you assess that in your own life.
[time=1824] And this is the best question I've ever heard that helps us think about whether or not we actually have, you know, kind of take a personal inventory of spiritual bankruptcy.
[time=1832] Do I view myself as having something there or do I view myself as having nothing?
[time=1836] And the question goes something like this, and as I ask it, I ask that you honestly evaluate it in your own life.
[time=1842] The question is this, if in fact you were to be standing before God,
[time=1849] maybe somehow for some reason you were to die, then you envision yourself there in front of the pearly gates of heaven, the kingdom of God.
[time=1857] That's what it's talking about, the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1860] And God would genuinely look at you in your eyes and you look at his.
[time=1863] And he would say, now, there's this matter of where you'll spend forever.
[time=1869] Why should I let you in to heaven?
[time=1876] Now maybe that question catches you off guard.
[time=1878] Maybe you've never heard it before.
[time=1879] Maybe you've never been asked that question before, and it strikes right at the center of this issue, poor in spirit.
[time=1885] How would you answer?
[time=1887] Please think for a moment.
[time=1889] You'd say, well, I believe that I should come into the kingdom of God,
[time=1895] or I should have heaven, because...
[time=1901] So many times when I ask people that question, the answer comes something like this.
[time=1905] Well, God, I know I'm not perfect.
[time=1908] I mean, I know I would never make the pretension of being perfect.
[time=1912] And I know I've made mistakes in my life, and I know I've had failures.
[time=1916] But God, I really believe, if you'd consider this, that I have tried very hard.
[time=1922] I mean, I've done my best.
[time=1925] My failures notwithstanding, I really have tried to be acceptable.
[time=1928] I mean, I've certainly never murdered anyone.
[time=1932] I mean, I'm not like someone who would need to be thrown in prison.
[time=1935] And yeah, there have been some harsh words, but I'm generally a kind person, and I try to help, and I've done a good job, I think, as a father, and I've done a decent job in my place of employment, and I'm a relatively decent citizen of the country that I lived in.
[time=1949] And as I compare myself to other people, I think I'm striking in there somewhere.
[time=1958] Now, this, you see, I want to be honest with you.
[time=1961] This is close to your answer.
[time=1963] Now, you may have finished it in different ways, but if in your answer you are saying, "Yeah, I know I'm not perfect, but there are these things about my life which would merit my entrance into your kingdom." If that at all resembles your answer, I just want to be honest with you this morning.
[time=1977] And I want to let you know that is not at all what the Bible describes as a poor in spirit,
[time=1983] as a contrite heart.
[time=1986] And it may be that that is part of the reason that you're not as happy and not as satisfied and not as fulfilled in your life, because you have grossly misunderstood this notion of being poor in spirit.
[time=2001] I think a lot of us labor with a misconception.
[time=2004] We have the notion that as long as we are trying hard to please someone, that that is what counts, and it's the genuineness of our effort, and therefore whatever we do somehow is pleasing to the person we have in mind.
[time=2019] I remember learning that that is not the case very vividly.
[time=2022] Some years ago when I was living in California, there was a family there called the manas, and he was working in our church and overseeing the Sunday school division, just a hard-working guy had done it so many years with a faithful spirit, and I just wanted to say thanks.
[time=2036] I just had it in my heart to communicate a sense of gratitude for his hard work.
[time=2040] And so I thought to myself, "Well, you know, the weight of a man's stomach or his heart is through his stomach, maybe the weight of this guy's heart is through his kids." He had two, he talked about them often.
[time=2048] They were, I think, ten and twelve, a daughter and a son, and so I got some tickets to the Dodger game.
[time=2054] And I said to him, "Would it be hard if I take your kids to the Dodger game?" I just want to say thank you to you for all you've done here in a small way.
[time=2062] He said, "Sure, no problem." So I'm all excited.
[time=2064] I got these tickets. I hustled at his house on the appropriate day.
[time=2066] I grabbed his two kids. We go to the ballpark, not bad seats.
[time=2069] You know, on the third baseline, first level, kind of a nice situation.
[time=2072] It was definitely a beautiful day, and they're kind of getting into the game.
[time=2075] I get in the programs and doing the thing, and I'm kind of thinking, "Now, what else could I do? My intentions are really good here.
[time=2080] I really want to say something to this family today." I thought, "I know, food. I won't ask them what I'll just hustle it up.
[time=2086] We won't have to go through that squabbling thing.
[time=2088] Is it they going to pay for it? Am I going to pay for that kind of stuff?" They won't even have to ask. I'll just show up with the food.
[time=2092] So I dismissed myself. I go back to the hot dog stand.
[time=2095] I say, "Give me three big Dodger dogs," as we call them, where I come from.
[time=2098] And I get the sodas, and I get the candy bars, and the frozen malts, and I load them up in their each little box, and then it's time for me to decorate the hot dog.
[time=2107] So I go over to the garnishings, and I roll the mustard in there, and I roll in the ketchup, and then here comes the green stuff. It's called relish.
[time=2116] Thank you. I knew that. And I roll that in there, and then I wrap the thing back up, and I put each one, and I show up, and here I am.
[time=2123] You know, heavy laden with wonderful things, good intentions, and I pass them out.
[time=2127] And I'm just kind of keeping an eye out the side, seeing how this is going.
[time=2132] And I'm thinking, "This has got to be a little bit like Christmas, huh, gang?" Yeah. Well, they get to the hot dog.
[time=2138] And the guy does this first, the son, 12 years old, he opens that thing up.
[time=2142] He kind of looks at you. And I said, "What's the matter?"
[time=2148] He says, "Oh, I don't eat mustard." And no sooner does he do that, then she opens her wrapping of her hot dog,
[time=2159] and she looks at me kind of like, and she says, "I don't eat ketchup."
[time=2165] And it's not like, "We don't like it." It's like, "We don't eat it." And it's all over their hot dogs. You get my drift?
[time=2174] And I've gone from like this sincere attempt to try to be grateful, to like slap these kids upside their head and say, "Eat the food.
[time=2181] What is your problem? Can't you just accept what I am trying to do today?"
[time=2187] In other words, this came from a pure heart gang, and I don't appreciate the fact that you don't appreciate what I'm trying to do.
[time=2195] Now, you've had experiences like that.
[time=2198] But for some reason, we get the notion that as long as we're down here on planet Earth,
[time=2204] trying our hardest, and figuring we're doing a pretty good job trying to please God,
[time=2210] when we stand up there in front of a pearly gate, he's going to go, "Ha, well, look at that!"
[time=2216] I really am pleased by what you've tried to do.
[time=2219] You see, and somehow he's going to be jumping out of his shoes thinking we did a great job.
[time=2224] But it doesn't work that way with people. Why should it work that way with God?
[time=2231] Interesting thing about God. God has said a few things about us.
[time=2236] There's a statement that he's made that all of us have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[time=2243] Now, in the analogy, all of us are showing up at the heaven gate there with hot dogs.
[time=2248] It got all the wrong stuff on them, and we're saying, "Here, God, like this!" And he's saying, "Sorry, I don't eat that stuff!"
[time=2258] And we're assuming that because we're excited about it, and we think we did a good job, and we've satisfied ourselves that he obviously is going to be overwhelmed.
[time=2270] This idea of sin, all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.
[time=2273] It's a wonderful word. It was used in the olden days of a person who would shoot in archery, and the guy would stand there and draw his bow and let go, and the arrow would hit the target,
[time=2285] or it would miss the mark. He wouldn't hit the thing.
[time=2290] That was their word for sin. When you miss the mark, you have sinned.
[time=2295] God is saying to us that with the bow of our life as hard as we have tried,
[time=2301] and as carefully as we have aimed, when we let go, the course of our life,
[time=2307] you see, it misses the mark. He wants us to know that,
[time=2313] and he wants us to admit that to him. That's what it means to be poor in spirit.
[time=2318] To be poor in spirit is to say, "Lord, I have done what I think is an admirable attempt
[time=2324] at trying to hit the target." Now, of course, I missed, and it went off the side, not that I didn't get a bullseye. I mean, it missed.
[time=2331] God is saying, recognize that about your life. Admit that.
[time=2340] And there are some who would say, "Well, yeah, I know, but I didn't miss as far.
[time=2343] I mean, I almost hit the target. I mean, I was close.
[time=2346] I was a lot better than him, and a whole lot better than her, and a whole lot better than them.
[time=2351] And so don't you think on some relative basis, God would be pleased with me, at least in that criteria?" Interesting.
[time=2357] Verse, James 2-10 says this, God speaking to you and me this morning.
[time=2360] He says, "If you have kept all the law, all your life, you have kept every single expectation of God, but at some point in the process, the beginning, the middle of the end, you violate one law." He says you're guilty of all, because the standard is absolute perfection.
[time=2379] He is, in fact, not going to compare us with our neighbors, our family members, or other people. He is comparing us to his standard of perfection, and what he is saying is, you either make it all the way, you either meet all the requirement, or you miss the requirement.
[time=2393] It's an all-or-nothing proposition.
[time=2395] When we were younger, we were traveling across the United States, and we stopped by the Grand Canyon, standing there on the edge of this huge abyss that went forever, it seemed, to the other side.
[time=2407] And we all stand there, and there's an older person here, and then there's a middle-aged guy like me, and then there's this young Olympic athlete.
[time=2415] And we say, let's jump, see how far we can jump.
[time=2418] And the older folks, you know, they're not as young and youthful anymore, but they make a great effort, great intentions.
[time=2425] Let me tell you, they have real intentions of jumping, and they jump as far as they can, oh, three, four feet out.
[time=2432] Here I come with my middle-aged problems, a little overweight, got a bum knee, not in shape like I used to be, a back way up, get a little bit of a run, and I go, man, I'm out there eight feet.
[time=2441] I'm looking really good, I'm waving at the old people as I go by.
[time=2444] See ya.
[time=2445] But then this Olympic athlete comes by, jumps tall, 28, 30 feet.
[time=2451] He's just like, it's the breeze.
[time=2454] And then all of us get caught by this thing called gravity.
[time=2459] And we all end up at the bottom, dead.
[time=2464] And does it matter that the Olympic athlete out-jumped me, or that I out-jumped this dear old lady?
[time=2470] No, we're all dead at the bottom.
[time=2473] For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[time=2477] You see, in order to make it, you gotta make it all the way to the other side.
[time=2481] And then there's, you know, speed, demon, evil, can evil.
[time=2485] And he gets his motorcycle, and he goes all the way across the grand canyon, but he's a foot short.
[time=2492] Guess where he ends up?
[time=2494] Same place I do.
[time=2496] At the bottom, dead.
[time=2498] Do you understand the concept?
[time=2501] God is not pleased by intentions.
[time=2505] And the assumption that, well, I've done the best I could.
[time=2509] He's saying, no, you've missed the mark.
[time=2512] And secondly, he is not in the comparison business.
[time=2516] He is not trying to figure out if you jumped five feet, eight feet, six feet, or almost all the way across.
[time=2522] What he's saying is, you gotta make it.
[time=2525] You gotta make it.
[time=2528] And if you're not making it, and by the way, folks, we're not making it.
[time=2533] What he's crying out for us to do is to say, help, I'm not making it.
[time=2542] That admission describes the poor in spirit.
[time=2548] Think with me for a minute about the kinds of people you want to be around.
[time=2551] You've got a politician on your hands.
[time=2553] You elect him into office.
[time=2555] Behind the scenes, he makes some decisions that are disastrous for you and for your community.
[time=2559] What do you want that politician to do?
[time=2562] You want him to get on the horn, write an article, get on the paper, get on the news, and say, you know what?
[time=2567] I made a terrible mistake in my judgment.
[time=2569] This is exactly what I said.
[time=2570] This is exactly what I did, and we're all reaping the consequences of my failure.
[time=2574] The last thing you want your politician to do, which I have a feeling they do a lot of, is to try to cover it up.
[time=2579] Try to blame it on somebody else, or blame it on some circumstance.
[time=2582] And though you can't figure it all out, you walk away with this feeling.
[time=2586] He's not leveling with me.
[time=2588] I don't like him. I can't trust him.
[time=2591] I don't want to be in a relationship with him.
[time=2593] Same thing with your mechanic.
[time=2595] You take your car into the mechanic.
[time=2597] You've got this big, bad rattle, and he says, I'll fix your big, bad rattle, and you come back and pay him big time money to fix your big, bad rattle, and you drive away, and it seems to be gone, but within weeks, it's back.
[time=2608] You take it back to him.
[time=2610] You think down in your heart he didn't really fix it right, but he comes up with some crazy story.
[time=2617] You say, I can't trust you.
[time=2619] I don't want to be in a relationship with you.
[time=2621] I'm not coming back here anymore.
[time=2623] You may not say it to him, but you say it in your heart, and you don't.
[time=2627] On a more personal level, think about your relationship with the people that really matter in your life like your spouse.
[time=2633] I have found in my relationship with Heidi that when we, when I violate her and we get into a problem over that,
[time=2641] my lack of love for her, I get this, this wall kind of goes up, this separation between the two of us goes up.
[time=2648] And the longer I try to dance around the issues, it's like I'm putting bricks and mortar on this wall.
[time=2654] I'm getting it bigger and thicker and taller because it doesn't cut it.
[time=2658] You can't have real relationship when you violated somebody and then you just try to paste it over and pretend it wasn't really you,
[time=2665] and you have all kinds of excuses and extraneous circumstances why all that happened.
[time=2669] You know what brings our relationship to life?
[time=2672] So when I find the guts and the courage by the grace of God to walk in there and say, "Hey, would you forgive me?" This is exactly what I did.
[time=2681] It was selfish, it was unthinking, it was cruel, it hurt your feelings, it had an impact on the girls.
[time=2687] Man, boom, we're back together.
[time=2692] She's a very forgiving woman.
[time=2696] Let me tell you something, it's that way with people, it's that way with your politicians, your mechanics, your wives, even your kids, it happens to be that way with God.
[time=2705] When you and I sit down here on Planet Earth and say, "Hey, well, I'm working on it, or I'm trying hard,
[time=2711] or I know I'm not, I'm not perfect, but I haven't done this and I haven't done that." If I walk into my wife and say, "I know that was a bad experience, but I haven't been as bad to you as so and so was," she doesn't give a rep.
[time=2722] We're talking about our relationship here.
[time=2725] See, God doesn't so much care.
[time=2728] God is wanting a genuine relationship with you through which he will infuse your life with his joy and his contentment,
[time=2735] but it begins with an honest admission that you're falling short.
[time=2740] You've got to own up to it.
[time=2744] You've got to stand in the gap and say, "God, have mercy on me because I'm a sinner."
[time=2753] As we close today, I want to give you two thoughts that maybe you're running through your minds about this notion of coming clean with God.
[time=2760] I mean coming clean.
[time=2762] I mean talking to him about the things that are dark and secretive in your life, and I mean about the cruelty that you've had towards people and really laying it on the line and really giving up on this false hope that you because of your good intentions will satisfy him someday.
[time=2775] You might have two thoughts in your mind, two frightful thoughts.
[time=2779] The first one is this, if I really do that, I mean if I really come clean with God about all the ways I've failed him, he'll reject me.
[time=2789] I mean it'll just be obvious.
[time=2791] He'll just throw me out.
[time=2794] Well, that's not true.
[time=2795] The Bible, he labors in the Bible to promise you that he will forgive you.
[time=2801] It's just the opposite of what you might think with a person.
[time=2804] He will forgive you.
[time=2805] Let me give you some of the big classic forgiveness promises in the Bible where he is laboring to communicate with you through illustration how badly he wants to forgive you.
[time=2815] The first one is what we call the stain removal promise.
[time=2818] The stain removal promise.
[time=2819] It's found in Isaiah 1, 18.
[time=2821] He says this, "Though your sins be like scarlet, I will make them like snow.
[time=2826] Though they be read as crimson, they shall be like wool." What he's trying to do is talk to you people who are into garments and you know about your clothing and you spill this huge ugly ketchup stain on your white shirt.
[time=2839] You're saying that's my life.
[time=2841] God has the stain removal promise.
[time=2843] He's saying if that's your sin, I'm going to wipe it out.
[time=2845] I'm going to clean your garment.
[time=2847] You're going to be washed as white as snow.
[time=2851] To others of you, he makes the deep sea promise.
[time=2853] Micah 7, 19.
[time=2855] I will cast their sins into the depths of the sea.
[time=2859] What he's saying is when you make that confession to me of your inadequacies and your failures and your sins and you from your heart confess that you've missed the mark and you can't jump the distance and nothing you could do could ever.
[time=2869] He wants to take all that stuff, all that sin, bundle it up and tie a huge rock on it
[time=2875] and throw it in the deep sea and it sinks to the bottom and then he posts a little sign.
[time=2879] No fishing, no dredging that stuff up.
[time=2882] That's gone.
[time=2883] It's gone in the deep sea.
[time=2887] He makes another promise called the East West promise of forgiveness.
[time=2892] Psalm 103 12 as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=2900] When you make that confession, that broken hearted, contrite heart confession of your sinfulness,
[time=2906] God it says if he puts you in that direction, you're going to go that way and your sin and all the things that are ugly about you and his eyes are going to go that way.
[time=2914] You don't go around the globe and collide.
[time=2917] You just go straight forever.
[time=2919] It's a concept of infinity that blows our minds and the point of it is this with the passing of each day and you're further away from your sin than you were the day before.
[time=2930] He moves you inexorably away from the stain and the stigma and the consequences of your sin.
[time=2939] Then I like this one.
[time=2940] He makes the amnesia promise.
[time=2942] Divine amnesia, Jeremiah 3134, I will forgive their iniquity and their sins I will remember no more.
[time=2950] You're feeling bad about something you did a year ago or five years ago and some triggering event reminds you of a cruel moment where you were really abusive to somebody and you're a wonder did God forgive me for that and you come back into his presence and you're saying God I'm so sorry forgive me and he's going forgive me for what?
[time=2965] I can't remember what you're talking about.
[time=2967] I have no knowledge of what you're referencing something that we already threw in the deepest sea.
[time=2971] We set it in the wrong direction from you.
[time=2973] I can't even remember it.
[time=2976] You say all that?
[time=2978] That's the kind of forgiveness I can expect.
[time=2981] If I go to God and honestly fess up and tell the truth about me and my sin, he's going to do all that with my sin?
[time=2988] Yeah.
[time=2989] Kind of completely, totally, forgive it.
[time=2994] There's one of the thought you might be struggling with and that kind of comes from our own human relationships.
[time=3000] I've been loved and I am loved by some people who I think really approach this idea of unconditional love.
[time=3007] But I know that in human relationships there are limits.
[time=3011] I know that there are times when if I push them far enough and long enough and hard enough, I kind of wonder whether they still love me or not and I kind of think to myself, boy, if I kept on that path long enough, maybe they wouldn't love me anymore.
[time=3023] Maybe they give up on me.
[time=3025] See, that's not God's love.
[time=3027] Jeremiah 31.3, he says I have loved you with an everlasting love.
[time=3033] I can absorb all that stuff, all the violations that you've made because I love you with an everlasting love.
[time=3040] To the people who are into space, he speaks this way.
[time=3043] Psalm 103.11, as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is God's love towards them who reverence him.
[time=3051] As high as the heavens are above the earth, some of you know this stuff.
[time=3054] Some of you are into space.
[time=3056] Some of you know that the farthest star in our galaxy is 63,000 light years away.
[time=3062] We could never get there in our most up-to-date spaceship.
[time=3066] It's impossible and you know the size of the galaxy and you're saying that speaks to me.
[time=3072] He loves me that much.
[time=3074] He loves me as high as the heavens are above the earth.
[time=3079] Yeah, and you can trust him.
[time=3081] You can tell him your faults.
[time=3083] You can come true on yourself.
[time=3085] There's one more that speaks real loud to me.
[time=3089] Psalm 103.13, listen to this, will you?
[time=3092] It says, "Just as a father has compassion on his own children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him."
[time=3099] Do you have a child?
[time=3101] Have you ever had a child?
[time=3103] Do you know what goes on in the heart of a parent for a child?
[time=3106] That's how much God loves you.
[time=3109] Yesterday we were enjoying the beautiful afternoon.
[time=3112] I was sitting in a chair in our family room.
[time=3115] There's a sliding glass door.
[time=3116] We had the door open.
[time=3117] The screen was the only thing that separated me from that gorgeous day.
[time=3119] As I looked out on her backyard, I was reading a book and Heidi kind of came through.
[time=3123] She said, "Well, we're all going for a bike ride." I said, "Great, have a good time." So she loaded up on those roller blades and put a little Bobby in a stroller.
[time=3131] And she's doing that thing down the street and the girls are all on their trikes and their bikes.
[time=3135] And this entourage of the Moore family goes down the street for a wonderful Saturday evening bike ride.
[time=3140] I said, "God bless them and may the house be quiet." No, just kidding.
[time=3145] And so I go back to my reading and you lose track of time.
[time=3149] And all of a sudden, out the back of my backyard, you got truer and gegline, four-way stop.
[time=3154] It's not uncommon for us to hear some screeching because people don't see the stop signs as often as they should.
[time=3161] Well, this time the screeching came and it was longer and it was louder than most times.
[time=3167] And I'm waiting for that blood-curdling sound of crunching metal.
[time=3172] And it came.
[time=3174] And I was on the phone at that moment with somebody from California who had interrupted my reading.
[time=3179] And I didn't even say goodbye.
[time=3181] I just hung up the phone because this thing went through my mind.
[time=3185] How do I know that they didn't go down our street around the corner and they were going by that intersection?
[time=3190] I'm thinking that could be my family out there.
[time=3193] And so I bolt out of my chair, run through the door, and I can't see this intersection because we have an eight-foot-high fence
[time=3200] and you can't see through the fence and I'm running for the gate and I finally get the gate open.
[time=3205] And there's no more family out there.
[time=3209] And I don't even really know what happened.
[time=3211] I just kind of shut the gate because I'll be honest, I wasn't really caring about the accident.
[time=3217] I was petrified as I ran out there that one of my kids, or worse, my wife was going to be laying out there in the street, hit by an automobile.
[time=3228] And as I shut that gate out, I was making my way back to the house and almost felt like I would collapse under the weight of just the thought of it, much less it actually happening to me.
[time=3237] Bending down over this lifeless little body and weeping and everything inside of me just falling apart as I know the love that I have for my...
[time=3248] That's the way that God loves you.
[time=3250] That's it.
[time=3251] That's what he's saying as a father has compassion for his child so God has compassion on those who reference him.
[time=3261] He is dying for you to tell the truth about yourself, to admit that you are a sinner and that there's nothing you can do.
[time=3272] You've missed the mark.
[time=3274] And as you're heading on your way down, do what the text gathered did and cry out and say, "Oh God, have mercy on me for I am a sinner."
[time=3283] And you know what he puts in motion at that very moment?
[time=3286] The forgiveness that we've talked about, the love that we've talked about.
[time=3291] And he begins to fill your heart and your life with a level of happiness and contentment that the world cannot know.
[time=3299] That people and things and possessions cannot provide.
[time=3306] You say, "I'd like that." But I don't know how to have a contrite heart.
[time=3310] I'm hearing you talk about it.
[time=3312] It makes sense to me, but it doesn't express what's really in my heart.
[time=3315] I'm a pretty self-sufficient person.
[time=3317] I'm pretty proud.
[time=3319] Let me give you just three simple things.
[time=3322] If you want to pursue this direction in your life, three simple things.
[time=3325] Number one, the Bible tells you to humble yourself.
[time=3329] What that means is take a good long look at the standard of God and the way you treat people.
[time=3334] And just to yourself, not even to God, be honest.
[time=3337] And give yourself an honest evaluation.
[time=3339] Humble yourself.
[time=3344] Secondly, I want to encourage you to pray because the Bible tells you to pray.
[time=3347] David cried out for a contrite heart.
[time=3350] He said, "God, give me a contrite heart." God will listen to that prayer and God will answer that prayer.
[time=3356] If you want a contrite heart this morning and you don't have one and you want one, you pray to God that He'll show you your sinfulness.
[time=3362] He'll give you a contrite heart.
[time=3364] He'll give you a brokenness over your life.
[time=3367] He'll let you step out of the shadows of your self-protection and your defensiveness.
[time=3373] Ask Him.
[time=3375] The third thing is when you think about it in your own life and you ask God to show it to you when you finally see it, come clean.
[time=3382] Come clean.
[time=3383] Make a true confession to God.
[time=3386] And say, "This is really what I am.
[time=3388] I am really a sinner and I cannot earn my way or deserve your salvation." And cry out like the sinner.
[time=3394] Have mercy.
[time=3395] And He will.
[time=3397] He will.
[time=3400] Let's pray together.
[time=3409] This is Friend Day at Blackhawk Baptist Church and we had a number of people that are visiting
[time=3422] our church for the first time.
[time=3424] And if you're watching the Bible Hour for the first time, I hope you enjoyed the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir and orchestra and our special guest, Robin.
[time=3433] And if you have made a decision to trust Christ as your personal Savior as a result of the message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore, let's take a moment right now and pray this prayer together and you can accept Jesus Christ right wherever you find yourself right now.
[time=3448] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful that I can come to you right now, wherever I am,
[time=3454] and tell you that I'm a sinner and that I've disobeyed you.
[time=3459] And I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart and be my Savior today, and in Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3468] If you prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3473] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3482] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the book by Charles Windall entitled,
