[time=23] Can I become discouraged about America?
[time=27] Can I become angry at the people who are leading the parade?
[time=32] And I find myself more and more with the passing of each and every day a minority.
[time=37] A minority of thought, a minority of opinion, a lone voice.
[time=44] [MUSIC]
[time=57] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=65] Thank you for joining us.
[time=67] The cultural climate is fast changing in America.
[time=70] The biblical base upon which this great land was founded is crumbling, abortions, the homosexual agenda and many other issues raise great concerns in the minds of many Christians.
[time=82] How is the Christian to know joy in the midst of all this turmoil?
[time=86] How would God have us view the tragic conditions of our country and how would He have us treat those that are leading that parade?
[time=95] Stay with us today as we gain insightful answers to these questions from God's Word.
[time=100] Our special music today will be provided by Lisa Finney
[time=105] [MUSIC]

[time=597] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour again today.
[time=601] In just a few moments you'll hear this third in a series of messages from the Book of Philippians by our Pastor Teacher Russell Moore.
[time=609] This happens to be one of my favorite books of the New Testament, a great series of four chapters.
[time=614] I hope that you'll stay with us each week as Pastor Moore develops his messages and his theme from the Book of Philippians.
[time=622] Next Sunday on the Bible Hour we're going to have a special guest speaker.
[time=626] His name is Dr. Robert Neenheis.
[time=628] Dr. Neenheis is the new Vice President of Taylor University Fort Wayne campus.
[time=634] Just recently moved to Fort Wayne from the state of Michigan.
[time=637] We're delighted to have him in our city.
[time=639] He'll be speaking for the first time at Blackhawk next Sunday and on the Bible Hour.
[time=644] He has a special unique title of his message.
[time=647] It's entitled Goldilocks, the Ark and a sliding glass door.
[time=652] He takes it from the Book of Genesis, chapter 7, verses 6 through 24.
[time=658] I hope you'll stay tuned to the Bible Hour next Sunday and get acquainted with Dr. Neenheis.
[time=665] We are appreciative of Taylor University in Fort Wayne and also in Upland and are thankful for that school being right here in our city.
[time=673] We're also going to have a special guest singing that Sunday morning.
[time=677] His name is Dan Tharleton.
[time=679] Dan is from South Bend, Indiana, was formerly a student at Western Baptist College when I was teaching out in Salem, Oregon.
[time=686] Also has sung with the sunlight, trail and is now singing as a soloist around the country.
[time=692] I'm delighted to have him here for this Bible Hour next Sunday.
[time=696] I hope you'll join with us with our two special guests, Dan Tharleton and our special speaker, Dr. Robert Neenheis.
[time=704] In my brokenness, in my heart of darkness,
[time=729] I will lift my hands to worship you.
[time=740] In my brokenness, in my time of sadness,
[time=751] I will lift my voice to you in grace.
[time=763] Time stands still when I kneel down before you.
[time=773] Life draws me like waves upon the shore they touch me.
[time=788] In my brokenness, in these whispering shadows,
[time=799] I will lift the pieces of my heart to you.
[time=829] Time stands still when I kneel down before you.
[time=840] Life is here, your waves of power and glory fill me.
[time=856] In my brokenness, in my heart of darkness,
[time=867] I will lift my hands to worship you.
[time=938] Amen. Thank you, Bill.
[time=942] I want to invite you to take your Bible and come with me to Philippians chapter 1 as we continue
[time=948] in our study of this book.
[time=950] When we come this morning to the last four verses of chapter 1, I'd like to read them and ask you to follow along in your Bible.
[time=958] Philippians chapter 1 verses 27 and following.
[time=965] Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[time=970] So that whether I come and see you or remain absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel.
[time=981] In no way alarmed by your opponents, which is a sign of destruction for them but of salvation for you, and that too from God.
[time=990] For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake, experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me and now here to be in me.
[time=1004] This text addresses a point of great concern in my own life, and I believe in yours.
[time=1012] And that is our attitudes about our culture
[time=1018] and the government that our culture has been putting into power as of late.
[time=1024] I mean by that in the last 30 or so years.
[time=1028] And I will confess to you a sense of discouragement that fills my heart oftentimes as I think about our culture, as I think about America, as I think about the future of this country, and with that there can become an attitude of anger or bitterness or hostility
[time=1045] towards the people who are leading the parade.
[time=1051] When I think about the national debt in the economy, some would say to me, "Now just relax, the economy has a way of going up and down, these things are cyclical, be patient, everything will come back, maybe it'll be better than it was before, and maybe they're right, but maybe they're wrong, and maybe there are some things that are different now that have never been like this before in the history of the United States, namely the national debt," which doesn't seem to be, anybody who wants to seem to really address that and deal with that.
[time=1081] And I feel no assurance that the people in power are really going to be committed to backing that thing out or down or bringing it under control.
[time=1089] I read the newspaper the other day, you know, it's so hard for us to conceive of these billion dollar figures because a billion dollars is so far beyond any of our experience.
[time=1098] And so the article endeavored to bring the numbers of the national debt and the national income and that kinds of stuff into family household terms, and the comparison was this, if your family makes $100,000 a year,
[time=1113] then in comparison with that with the national gross income, and if you take the debt associated with our country, then your family would also be $385,000 in debt.
[time=1125] You'd make $100,000 a year, you'd be $385,000 in debt, and you were on your way to spending $125,000 in the next year.
[time=1136] Debt spending, so there's no possible way for you to deal with the debt you have, the nearly $400,000, because you're going to add $25,000 to it by the next 12 months.
[time=1147] Now I want to ask you a question, if that's going on in your family, how long is your family going to be able to exist?
[time=1154] How long until the roof caves in, how long until the floor gives out?
[time=1157] I mean, you can't just continue on like that.
[time=1160] I can confess that when I look at my future and I look at my children and I look at my home and my wife and the life that I have come to know and enjoy, I feel discouraged by that information.
[time=1172] And I, in a sense, can anticipate with some sense of plausibility that this country may go through a horrible financial crisis, maybe comparable to what happened in the Great Depression, I don't know.
[time=1185] But I can get discouraged and I can feel a sense of hostility and anger towards the people who continually lead our nation into this increased debt spending.
[time=1195] They have broken with the biblical pattern of living inside your means and they are leading us all into a potentially, financially and therefore family and community and culturally devastating event.
[time=1209] I also confess to you that when I look at what's going on in our country by way of public policy and the whole idea that abortion can be legal and that by now, since that decision, we have performed some 25 million abortions and now new laws are making it possible to sell off the product of these abortions
[time=1229] for a price, I become discouraged because I don't believe that God is going to allow
[time=1236] that to continue unpunished and unanswered for very long.
[time=1242] And I can become angry at the people who allow those kinds of laws to put my life and my family in jeopardy of the wrath of God.
[time=1252] I say also that same feeling with the homosexual agenda in the United States of America, which is only picking up steam and gaining momentum.
[time=1263] I think often of what is going on in Los Angeles, of course I'm from there and when we had Bob Vernon here and here was a great man of Christian stature and value and he and Bob, Chief Gates, through the last number of years,
[time=1278] have been able to take a relatively small task of men, some 6,000 police officers and police were the largest cities in the world and because of the biblical principles of truth and honesty and commitment and hard work, were able to have levels of efficiency in their police force that made them a leader around the world.
[time=1295] Bob is gone and so is Chief Gates by virtue of the ACLU and a whole lot of other people
[time=1301] who despise the notion that men of that virtue and character would hold positions of authority.
[time=1306] And I understand now that the Los Angeles Police Department is actively recruiting, openly recruiting, homosexuals into their force.
[time=1315] Now I didn't learn a lot about world history in high school, but I do remember studying the rise and fall of the Third Reich and I remember what happened when Hitler's regime became infested and was being led by homosexuals and the kinds of devastating things these people who are so full of hatred for themselves and for mankind are capable of doing.
[time=1334] I have great concern for that city and the people that I love who are still there and I can become discouraged over their future and I can become angry at the people who lead the parade.
[time=1345] And I know that though we are in a marvelous way protected in many ways by being here in the Midwest from some of those front leading edge issues just give it a few years and we'll be having it in our own city.
[time=1358] I become further discouraged and angry at what is going on with the youth in this country.
[time=1364] As our academic performance continues to plummet down national literacy rates and we are bumping our way down the list and young people in our country are not able to graduate from high school with competency level reading and math and writing much less ability to pursue and really penetrate the highly technological day in which we live.
[time=1383] And when I speak in the most simple terms to people who are instructing the children in public schools today
[time=1389] they tell me a guy teaching fifth grader in our school right here in our public school system in Fort Wayne says the problem is there is no discipline and I can't control my class.
[time=1399] And I can't control my class because the parents have no authority over the children in many case there are no parents or there's one or there's a broken home and the home itself is in the point of great flux.
[time=1410] And so I look at an entire generation of young people and the talent and the minds that God has given them
[time=1416] to be trained and cultivated to contribute to society and it's being thrown away.
[time=1420] And in its place the definition of a great day in the minds of our youth today is how much fun that I have.
[time=1427] Absolute total hedonism.
[time=1429] And did I do my drugs and did I listen to my music and did I do my safe sex which is obviously a myth
[time=1435] but that seems to be the vogue.
[time=1437] And so this whole generation of young people is sold down the river and virtue and integrity and character and contribution to society is forfeited and I lose hope for this country in the future because soon they will be in charge.
[time=1454] And I become angry and I could go on as you could to list off the ways in which this great country is falling apart.
[time=1466] The question that Paul is addressing to us this morning is joy, joy in the midst of this kind of degrading circumstances
[time=1477] in the devolution of a government and when a people, a Christian people, a people who have embraced Christ
[time=1483] mind themselves in a culture and its government that is hostile to the claims of Christ and the purposes of Christ
[time=1490] how can the citizen no joy in the midst of that.
[time=1493] And I must confess to you that this study this week was very confrontive of my own life and my own sin
[time=1499] as I have already told you the sense of discouragement and anger that fills my heart and how it's completely confronted
[time=1505] and revealing that my values are in the wrong place.
[time=1509] And so I'll share with you this morning the product of my study and I trust it will impact your heart positively for the cause of Christ.
[time=1517] In verse 27 at the beginning of that verse we understand that this is all about politics and it's all about a government
[time=1523] and it's all about loyalties and it's all about affinities to your citizenship because the word conduct though it is not translated to give that flavor is a word that means to be a citizen.
[time=1535] It is in fact the conduct of a citizen.
[time=1540] And the people in Philippi understood that because they were a Roman colony.
[time=1545] Their greatest pride and joy the esprit decor, the momentum, the sense of enthusiasm and excitement that made
[time=1553] Philippi what it was was the simple fact that they were a Roman colony.
[time=1557] And as such they spoke the Roman language, Latin, they dressed in the Roman dress and they called their magistrates by Roman titles.
[time=1565] It was a little Rome. They viewed Rome as their mother and she was the guiding light and she was that which gave them
[time=1572] and their city a sense of significance and it was a productive city and an aggressive city.
[time=1577] And there was a great pride taken in the fact of their Roman colonization so they worked for the common good
[time=1583] and it says in Acts chapter 16 that Philippi was a leading city in Macedonia, the region of Macedonia.
[time=1589] These people were fired up about being a Roman colony. Their citizenship meant everything to them.
[time=1597] Some of these people at Philippi who were making these great contributions to their city and to their citizenship
[time=1603] and to all that it meant to be in Philippi were coming to Christ.
[time=1608] And suddenly by virtue of the transforming work of Christ in their life they were put on the outside of society.
[time=1616] Their citizenship by virtue of being a colony of Rome was no longer an asset to them, it had become a liability.
[time=1625] They were becoming outcasts and they were becoming the object of persecution and they were no longer fitting in.
[time=1630] In fact their leader the man who had come and led them to Christ was now imprisoned by Rome itself.
[time=1636] He was in Rome and imprisoned waiting to find out if he would be put to death at the hand of Nero for his Christian faith.
[time=1642] And so these people had somewhat the same tension that I think I find in my own heart and that you may find in your heart.
[time=1651] What am I a citizen of? Philippi or the kingdom of heaven?
[time=1658] What am I a citizen of? America? America the beautiful? Or heaven itself?
[time=1666] Chapter 3, Philippians, the state will come back in just a second.
[time=1669] If you want to glance to Philippians 3 verse 20 he says this, Philippians 3, 24 our citizenship is in heaven from which also we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1681] We could track this theme in other places in the Word of God but won't for the sake of time this morning, Philippians 1 now.
[time=1686] We are citizens of heaven and he is saying conduct yourselves in verse 27 of chapter 1 in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[time=1696] I'll never forget my first experience in a communist country some six, seven years ago I flew in to communist China.
[time=1705] And I had no idea what to expect, how I would react, how it would be treated, what would happen to me but our plane landed there.
[time=1712] And I stood at the front of the top of the stairs and ready to exit down off the plane, through the stairs that led to the airport itself.
[time=1722] And at the bottom of those stairs stood a member of the red guard, a full fledged bonafide communist soldier.
[time=1731] And as I unexpectedly rounded the bend on the plane and looked down the steps and there he was, I jolted in my spirit and felt as if we were ready to fight.
[time=1740] Because I am an American and I was raised in a relatively conservatively political home and the communists are the bad guys.
[time=1750] And it was a confusing moment for me, a very confusing moment. My identity was in question because I had not come to fight this man, I had come to give him the gospel.
[time=1761] But I felt like I wanted to fight him.
[time=1765] And I began to remember in my mind all the massacres that the communists have carried out in their plots and their employees and the millions and millions of people that have been put to death and slaughtered by the communist regime of China in years gone by.
[time=1777] And suddenly I was standing in the middle of my own identity crisis, was I an American standing against this man ideologically and politically?
[time=1785] Or was I a citizen of the kingdom of God who had come with little regard for his ideology to bring him the gospel that he might come to Christ?
[time=1794] So I find these tensions in my heart not just when I'm in the Soviet Union or Russia, but now in our own country.
[time=1803] As I've already noted, many things caused me great discouragement and concern for the country.
[time=1810] And I am regularly finding myself in many identity crises as I watch this country fall apart and feel the attendant discouragement and anger of those who lead the parade.
[time=1823] But Paul is inviting us to another kind of life.
[time=1826] Paul is inviting us to know the uninterrupted joy of relationship with Christ and he is going to show us what our true values need to be in the midst of this kind of crisis.
[time=1837] He is going to show us how to resolve the identity crisis and land firmly on the side of my residency and my citizenship being in heaven so that I can have compassion, not anger and hostility on those abroad and those in my own country who would destroy a way of life.
[time=1854] It begins in verse 20, 7 when he says only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ.
[time=1862] The word only is in the English and the Greek put in the emphatic to understand you have but one citizenship.
[time=1869] You are really a citizen of but one place preeminently.
[time=1873] It has this presiding overall emphasis upon your citizenship in heaven which means therefore live in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[time=1883] It is a higher calling than your earthly citizenship.
[time=1886] It is a higher agenda, it is a place of greater pride and it should have your greater allegiance.
[time=1892] Your love for the citizenship in heaven and the gospel itself.
[time=1896] Let me say it to you this way.
[time=1898] Your joy and my joy should not be impacted by the deteriorating condition of this country.
[time=1906] Our joy cannot be tied to the welfare of America.
[time=1911] We cannot confuse our Christianity with our country.
[time=1918] John Seal in one of his books says it this way.
[time=1922] "A politicized faith not only blurs our priorities but weakens our loyalty.
[time=1929] Our primary citizenship is not on earth but in heaven.
[time=1933] Though few evangelicals would deny this truth in theory the language of our spiritual citizenship frequently gets wrapped in the red, white and blue.
[time=1942] Rather than acting as resident aliens of a heavenly kingdom too often we sound like and act like resident apologists for a Christian America.
[time=1953] Unless we reject the false reliance on the illusion of Christian America evangelicalism will continue to distort the gospel and thwart its genuine biblical identity."
[time=1964] That's true.
[time=1965] You and I are super culture.
[time=1968] You and I by virtue of our faith in Christ rise above the issues of this country or that country or any other country God may choose to place us in.
[time=1978] Allegiances are not with the country or allegiances are with Christ the kingdom of heaven and therefore the gospel and to live in such a way worthy of the gospel.
[time=1987] It should matter not to us which country we find ourselves in.
[time=1991] For in any country we find ourselves in we can pursue the cause of Christ.
[time=1996] You say how does this work?
[time=1998] Well he was going to explain this to us in verses 27 to 30 on two basic points.
[time=2003] For one the unity of the church to strive for the faith and the suffering of the church for the sake of Christ.
[time=2021] The first one the unity of the church.
[time=2027] Think of it this way.
[time=2029] The government the people in charge of this country could very easily turn the tables on us in such a way that because of our commitment to absolute truth.
[time=2040] And their absolute commitment to relativism the fact that there is no absolute truth.
[time=2045] They could change all the ground rules of this country and we could be out and out down and out.
[time=2051] They could take our building, they could take our property, they could take our jobs, they could take our homes.
[time=2059] You say what would your response be to that?
[time=2061] Have they taken away the most important things in your life?
[time=2065] I say not.
[time=2066] Because the ministry and the people of Black Hawk Baptist Church will go on.
[time=2071] Because we don't need this building and we don't need our jobs and we don't even need our homes.
[time=2077] You know what we need? We need each other. We congregate and we will do what the church has always done.
[time=2082] We will worship, we will pray, we will teach the Word, we will care for one another, we will bring people to Christ and we will baptize those people.
[time=2089] We will move the kingdom.
[time=2090] We will strive together for the sake of the gospel.
[time=2093] They can strip us of every luxury, every amenity, everything that is wrapped up in the phrase, the life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and they haven't taken anything from us.
[time=2104] Because our agenda and our priority and our first commitment and our higher calling goes beyond what America is and stands firmly and completely and solely in the person of Christ and His cause.
[time=2117] Let me give this to you as the passage does.
[time=2121] I want to explain three words to you that I think open our eyes to understand this.
[time=2125] In verse 20, says conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that whether I come and see you or remain absent.
[time=2132] I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind.
[time=2138] The word standing firm literally means to be at a post in war.
[time=2143] It describes a soldier who won't budge.
[time=2146] It describes a soldier who is committed to standing as post, what's the post that the church would be together in one mind and one spirit.
[time=2155] There would be a solidarity and a unity that would pervade the people of Blackhawk Baptist Church that no amount of outside conflict and disruption by the government or the other people who run this culture could ever intrude on or invade upon.
[time=2168] In fact, the more they turn the heat up out there, the hotter it would get in here for our sense of unity and our commitment to be of one mind and one spirit.
[time=2178] Secondly, he goes, jump to verse 28, "In no way alarmed by your opponents." That's a beautiful pictorial word.
[time=2186] The word alarmed in classical Greek described that action of a horse in battle.
[time=2192] A man would be on top of his horse and fighting his battle and suddenly, whether it be the report of the cannon or the flash of the sword or the commotion that goes on around,
[time=2201] this great horse would become spooked and it would bolt unexpectedly and the soldier on top of that horse would become very vulnerable.
[time=2209] He may fall off onto the ground and become easy prey or in having to distract his attention to the horse itself, take a blow that he otherwise wouldn't take.
[time=2219] The picture here is of you and of me, the people of Blackhawk Baptist Church understanding the cultural changes of our day and being anticipating that not being spooked, not being alarmed, not having to shy away from the battle.
[time=2235] So the one we serve will stand strong and his reputation will be unimpinged by our spooked reaction.
[time=2244] Then it says at the end of verse 27, go back there for a minute, standing firm in one spirit with one man, and this is where it comes together, striving together for the faith of the gospel.
[time=2255] If holding your post and not being spooked represent what we're not going to do, the striving together represents what we're going to do.
[time=2262] It's not just holding a defensive position, it's taking a very aggressive stance for the gospel of Christ.
[time=2270] The word striving together soon in the Greek is an athletic term, and it doesn't just mean to strive and to agonize in combat or in some athletic event as a district's runner might or as a wrestler might, this word describes a team concept.
[time=2288] This is a group of people, and this whole passage is about us.
[time=2292] If this can't be done individually, this must be done together as a church as we stand firm in one spirit with one man, and then we are striving together for the faith of the gospel.
[time=2301] The term reminds me of my earlier days playing football in high school, and you remember out there on the field, the sled, they called it the sled, and there'd be spots for six or seven linemen to get up and push that thing.
[time=2312] And you could send your biggest and your strongest lineman over to the sled, and he could hit it with all his worth, and the thing doesn't even move.
[time=2320] They built it that way on purpose because they wanted the lineman to understand unless they all move out simultaneously together and make their impact at the same time with equal force, nothing of consequence is going to happen in the game.
[time=2334] And when they all get down in front of that thing together and they all wait for the call and they all wait for the signal and it comes and they explode out of their stance and hit the sled, they can drive it all over the field, even with the coach standing on it.
[time=2347] So this is a wonderful passage of community. This is the church, the ecclesia.
[time=2351] This is all of us together striving passionately for the gospel amidst a very difficult culture and amidst a government empowered by that culture, which is hostile to the gospel.
[time=2363] I want you to notice we are not striving together for the old American way.
[time=2368] We are not striving together for our place in society. We are not striving together to hold the moral fabric of the community together so we can maintain our economic privilege.
[time=2378] We are not striving together for our buildings. We are striving for one thing and one thing alone, the faith of the gospel to bring people to Christ.
[time=2390] I hear people getting angry, I hear myself getting angry and I hear Christians getting angry and they are about ready to declare war on the unsaved world.
[time=2400] One national leader back in 1990 after a national prayer conference in Washington DC held a meeting for Christians and the purpose of this meeting was the formation of a Christian Anti-Defamation League.
[time=2413] A Christian Anti-Defamation League and he described it this way, you meaning the press and the government, you have called us fools so we will call you bigots.
[time=2425] Christians are tired of being stepped on and the time has come to stand up for our Christian rights.
[time=2431] It's as if the Christians are going to get in line with the homosexuals and the pro-abortionists and everybody else and say we got rights and we want our rights.
[time=2439] And if you don't give us our rights, we're mad at you and you're on the wrong side and we're angry.
[time=2445] No way. It doesn't happen folks. That's not what it means to strive for the gospel.
[time=2452] It doesn't mean we organize ourselves into political entities and demand our rights and force our way through that is absolutely foreign to the Christian concept.
[time=2461] Christ organized no such regime and Rome was entirely hostile to his message, to his person and to his program.
[time=2470] Almost as if the Christians are ready to declare war on the unsaved world.
[time=2476] For perspective on this, come with me to Titus chapter 3 for just a second.
[time=2483] This really lays it on the line.
[time=2487] Same thing going on here. These Christians are outcasts in their culture. The government is working against them.
[time=2492] They are counterculture. They are being persecuted. They are losing their property. They are losing their friends. They are losing their status.
[time=2501] And Paul writes to Titus and says I want you to remind them of a few things.
[time=2505] The first in verses 1 and 2, Titus chapter 3, remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed.
[time=2516] Who are these rulers? Who are these authorities? Everybody from Caesar to Pilate to Felix to Festus to Agrippa to Herod to Stalin to Clinton?
[time=2525] It's everybody who holds a position of power. It's everybody who's got a position of power in a government.
[time=2530] And it doesn't mean they're the ones you agree with. It doesn't mean they're the ones you like.
[time=2534] It doesn't mean they're the ones that are orchestrating the country in ways you think are proper.
[time=2538] It just says remind them to be subject to the rulers and to the authorities.
[time=2542] And we could go to Romans 13 and be reminded that they are in power by the power of God. Nobody comes into power, but God does not put them there.
[time=2551] What are we supposed to do with them? Verse 1, be obedient. Be ready for every good deed.
[time=2557] And of course our obedience stops when they ask us to violate biblical principles in our own lives, but short of that we will obey them.
[time=2564] But then look at verse 2, and this is really what puts a stopper on all my slamming Clinton jokes.
[time=2570] It says here, malign no one. Malign no one. The uncontentious gentle showing every consideration for all men, the word malign means to blaspheme.
[time=2581] It means to denigrate. It means to tear somebody down.
[time=2585] Folks, there is no place to be in the process of maligning the person of our government leaders, his wife himself, his vice president, that person's wife, the cabinet, the Congress, whoever it is.
[time=2598] That is anti-Christian behavior, and it sends a very strong message of your priorities to the people who hear you.
[time=2609] As you stand in the marketplace, as you talk with the people you work with and you jump on the political bandwagon and you slur these people and cut them and rip them and shred them, you are sending out an anti-Christian message.
[time=2622] It is contrary to striving together for the faith of the gospel. Why? Because our true loyalties and our true citizenship are not of this country.
[time=2631] Secondarily, we are here for one reason to bring these people to Christ.
[time=2637] And if we allow their political agenda and their economic agenda and their health plans to become points of contention to wherein our hearts were angry with them because they threatened our economic well-being, how in the world are we going to evangelize them?
[time=2651] How in the world are we going to love them and communicate the kind of care and concern for them that those who see us every day must understand about us?
[time=2666] Well, the second point he brings, verses 29 and 30, is that we should count at a privilege to suffer for the sake of Christ.
[time=2674] You say, "Okay, now I do all this stuff we're talking about here." Does that mean that because I'm a Christian, that it doesn't hurt and I don't get a feeling of sorrow in my heart, that all my stuff is being taken away and that these evil people are running over the land and that they're taking my family away from me and all that.
[time=2689] Does that mean that I just doesn't feel like suffering? Because I'm Christian, he waves a magic wand over me and a little protective bubble comes down and I don't feel the pain and the sorrow of it all? No.
[time=2699] You'll feel the pain and the sorrow of living for God's agenda just as much as Christ did.
[time=2704] Underneath it, there'll be true joy, but you're going to feel it.
[time=2708] And so he gives perspective, verse 29, "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake." The word granted.
[time=2718] Karidzo in the Greek, it's another word for grace. In fact, it's the primary word for grace. In other words, he's saying, "I have graciously given you the present, the thing you didn't deserve, not only to believe but to suffer." He counts suffering for the cause of Christ, a great privilege in our lives.
[time=2735] That's the kind that you get excited about. I get to suffer for Christ.
[time=2740] That's how he's describing it. You think he's weird. You think he's warped. No, you're warped. And I'm warped because my values aren't there.
[time=2747] I've never placed a high value on suffering for Christ, frankly.
[time=2752] But that doesn't mean the word of God is wrong. That means I'm wrong.
[time=2755] That means I need to go back to chapter 1, verse 9. "I pray this that your love may abound still more and more in what real knowledge and all discernment."
[time=2764] I'm a part of that youth culture that was taught hedonism and pleasure, and the definition of a great day is how much fun did I have.
[time=2771] And what we hope and pray is that the power of God will strip that and refine us in that way and fill us with an abounding love for the privilege if it should come to that to openly suffer for the sake of Christ.
[time=2786] Notice in verse 30, he says experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me and now here to be in me.
[time=2794] Now here to be in me. You know where he is. He's in Rome. He's in prison. He's under house arrest.
[time=2801] But what does he mean experiencing the same conflict which you saw in me?
[time=2806] For that, come with me to Acts chapter 16. This is an amazing little story that teaches us a lot about our citizenship.
[time=2815] And how to be joyful citizens even in a country that's fallen apart, that's going anti-Christian, anti-biblical, anti-God.
[time=2826] Paul went to Philippi by direct decree of God through what they call the Ethiopian vision, excuse me, the Macedonian vision.
[time=2836] And he shows up in the city, a wonderful little city and he meets a woman named Lydia and he leads her to Christ and that's exciting.
[time=2843] And then in verse 16 of chapter 16, the book of Acts, it happened that as they were going to a place of prayer, a certain slave girl having a spirit of divination met us who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune telling.
[time=2854] You see, they were using this gal like many of men in our day use a woman for prostitution.
[time=2858] They don't much care about her soul, the condition of her life.
[time=2861] The fact is she's got something they can sell and they're making a lot of money on it.
[time=2864] In this girl's case, it was the spirit of divination.
[time=2866] Somehow the demons within her gave her the ability to create wealth, maybe by telling people's fortunes or doing whatever.
[time=2872] She followed Paul and Silas around.
[time=2874] Verse 17 saying, "These men are bond servants of the most high God, proclaiming to you the way of salvation."
[time=2881] She continued doing this for many days, verse 18.
[time=2883] Paul greatly annoyed, turned and said, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out of her that very moment.
[time=2890] The problem is the masters got upset.
[time=2892] These guys just lost their little cash register.
[time=2895] This little girl wasn't going to make them any more money.
[time=2897] The unique kinds of money she can make by way of having a spirit of divination in her.
[time=2902] And so they gather their people together and the crowds rode up in verse 22.
[time=2907] The crowd rose up together against them and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods.
[time=2914] When they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into the inner prison commanding the jailer to guard them securely and having received such a command threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in stocks.
[time=2923] Unbelievable experience.
[time=2926] He liberates a girl from demon possession.
[time=2930] But the culture would rather see her enslaved by these greedy men than rejoice over her liberation.
[time=2939] And so they rise up together.
[time=2941] Money is obviously the element and the issue in this particular society.
[time=2946] And they rip their clothes off, they beat them with rods which in the hands of these masterful men would have left his back a bloody pulp.
[time=2954] Ripping and tearing and striking all the way to the bone.
[time=2957] And then they threw them in the inner prison in that little jail in Philippi.
[time=2961] A prison where there would have been all kinds of sanitary problems and it was dark and there would have been flies and maggots moving onto their bodies
[time=2970] which had just been beaten and the skin filleted opened.
[time=2973] And then their feet and hands are fastened in stocks.
[time=2976] And that's not the picture we have of early American history kind of drooping the hands and the head through the little holders there.
[time=2983] This is a very painful device of torture where the feet and the arms are spread out by this device and held to be that way until the body contorts an excruciating pain for lack of ability to move and exercise the limb.
[time=2998] What are they doing in verse 25?
[time=3001] We want to see some joy.
[time=3003] But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying, singing hymns of praise to God and the prisoners were listening to them.
[time=3010] Why?
[time=3011] Well because you see they had an agenda and the agenda was the gospel.
[time=3016] And it was their privilege to be in that place and to minister to those prisoners and to that jailer.
[time=3022] That became their new area of ministry.
[time=3025] And as you know from the story suddenly there was a localized earthquake and the earthquake broke open the jails and the Philippian jailer there who under Roman law would have been killed had he lost one of his prisoners began to prepare to kill himself.
[time=3037] And Paul yells out and says do yourself no harm and the Philippian jailer asks the question what must I do to be saved?
[time=3045] Why was that question on his mind?
[time=3046] Well because I'm sure that these songs and these hymns and these praising things were full of the truth of salvation.
[time=3052] You know what happened?
[time=3054] He prayed to receive Christ that night and so does his entire household.
[time=3060] This is what so I find so intriguing about this though.
[time=3062] Look at verse 35 this is where it really heats up with respect to our citizenship in America and heaven.
[time=3068] Now in day came the chief magistrates sent their policemen saying release those men.
[time=3073] And the jailer reported these words to Paul saying the chief magistrates have sent to release you now therefore come out and go in peace.
[time=3080] But Paul said to them you have beaten us in public without trial.
[time=3084] Men who are Romans and have thrown us into prison and now they are sending us away secretly?
[time=3089] No indeed but let them come themselves and bring us out.
[time=3093] And the policemen reported these words to the chief magistrates and they were afraid, exceedingly afraid when they heard that they were Romans.
[time=3101] And they came and appealed to them and when they had brought them out they kept begging them to leave the city.
[time=3105] And when they went out of the prison they entered the house of Lydia and when they saw the brethren they encouraged them and then they departed.
[time=3110] What is this about?
[time=3112] Let me help you understand this.
[time=3114] Do you realize that Paul is a Roman citizen?
[time=3116] There is a law that goes this way. A Roman citizen may never be tried.
[time=3121] Excuse me, may never be beaten, may never be thrown in prison, may never be put in stocks without a proper trial.
[time=3129] He never got it. It was a mob lynching.
[time=3132] The man who owned that slave girl got the mob going and they just went off half cock.
[time=3137] Here is the point. At any point in that suffering.
[time=3140] At any point in that beating. At any point in they are being thrown into prison.
[time=3145] At any point in they are being put into stocks all Paul had to say was I am a Roman citizen and the thing stops instantly.
[time=3153] You say why didn't he do that?
[time=3157] Why did he do that?
[time=3160] Well it doesn't say it in the text but I have to believe that somewhere in his relationship with the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God was saying forgo the rights of Roman citizens and endure this suffering
[time=3172] because I have some people that I want you to reach through this trial.
[time=3176] I have some people that I want you to touch inside that jail.
[time=3180] It just so happens it was the Philippian jailer and his entire household.
[time=3185] So at the beginning of the story he waves his Roman's rights and he holds on to his right as a citizen of the kingdom of God whereby we consider the blessing to suffer for Christ.
[time=3199] And then later in the story when they try to shoe him out of the city and make him go away then he says not so fast.
[time=3205] I got some rights here and I am going to use these rights not to keep me from getting a beating but I am going to use these rights to show the rest of the Christians in this city that I love them.
[time=3213] And so he goes to see Lydia whom he had just led to the Lord and he goes to see the other brethren and he encourages them
[time=3219] and he strengthens them and I am sure he teaches them about the citizenship issue.
[time=3224] When to express your rights as an earthly citizen and when to waive them and the only decision for that is not your personal comfort,
[time=3230] your desires or your hopes and your dreams, it is which one do I think?
[time=3234] To either stand for my rights as an American or to give them up, which choice promotes the gospel?
[time=3241] It puts a whole new light on our rights doesn't it?
[time=3245] You and I don't have any rights?
[time=3247] What do you mean rights?
[time=3249] I thought I was a hell bound sinner.
[time=3252] I thought my rights are to burn forever aren't yours?
[time=3256] I thought it was grace that saved me and I thought that with that grace came a compelling love and a compassionate desire to do anything and everything I can do to propagate the cause of Christ.
[time=3266] National rights? Who cares?
[time=3269] If they are helpful to me I will call on them for the gospel.
[time=3272] If they are not helpful to me I won't even mention them and I will get beat and thrown in prison.
[time=3276] Is the attitude Paul is conveying?
[time=3282] Well it's a great and wondrous day when believers begin to move in this direction.
[time=3289] For God is glorified.
[time=3292] The gospel goes forward.
[time=3295] Come back now to Philippians and let me just show you how this draws itself to a conclusion.
[time=3302] To let her about joy 16 times the word joy is used and what he is saying is though I have been thrown in prison in verse 12,
[time=3309] I rejoice. Even though I have lost my freedom I rejoice because there is the greater progress of the gospel.
[time=3316] And then later in the chapter in verse 18 he says even though my some of the best of friends, some of the men that I have discipled and brought to Christ though they preach to cause me strife and preach to cause me distress in my imprisonment verse 18 but I rejoice.
[time=3329] Why? Because Christ is proclaimed.
[time=3332] And then in the next few verses of the chapter when he thinks about his own physical well-being and the very real possibility of death at the hand of Nero he says at the end of verse 20 it doesn't matter to me because Christ even now as always will be exalted in my body whether by life or by death.
[time=3347] And then finally in this chapter he addresses citizenship and how to have joy in the midst of a hostile culture
[time=3353] and a hostile government installed by that culture.
[time=3356] And he says folks ladies and gentlemen let me give it to you straight.
[time=3359] Stand together as the body of Christ unified in one heart and one mind striving together not for your national rights,
[time=3365] not for your personal rights, not for your economic rights, not for your political rights but for the faith of the gospel.
[time=3372] Let it all go and stand for the truth of the gospel.
[time=3377] And then he says and you can anticipate suffering for that.
[time=3381] There will be some blows that will come your way but even then remember it's the gracious privilege of God
[time=3387] that will allow you to suffer for the sake of Christ.
[time=3390] It's quite a standard isn't it?
[time=3394] You set your heart free to be there?
[time=3397] As I'll pray to set my heart free to be there and as I say very convicting in front of message for me
[time=3403] I believe we'll know a level of joy that we've never known before.
[time=3408] Let's pray together.
[time=3417] [MUSIC]
