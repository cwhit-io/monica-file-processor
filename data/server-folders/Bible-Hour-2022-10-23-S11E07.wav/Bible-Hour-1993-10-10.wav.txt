[time=10] Say the word rainbow, and people think of experiences they've had when they've seen rainbows in the sky.
[time=30] Say the word famine, and we're reminded of the visual images that we have seen in our televisions of small children and adults who haven't eaten.
[time=42] And say the word evangelism in the church, and everybody either feels guilty or begins to come up with excuses or they feel pain.
[time=60] [BLANK_AUDIO]
[time=68] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=77] Thank you for joining us.
[time=78] Do you feel guilty when someone speaks the word evangelism?
[time=83] Well, on today's program, our special guest speaker, Dr. Robert Neheis, will be speaking on the subject of evangelism in a message he has entitled, "Tell the world I'm what?"
[time=94] Dr. Neenheis is Vice President of Taylor University at Fort Wayne.
[time=98] Our special music today will be provided by Dan Tharleton.
[time=102] Dan sang at Black Hawk several years ago when he was a member of the nationally known group, Sunlight.
[time=108] Let's join our sanctuary choir and orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=112] [MUSIC]
[time=123] This is the day.
[time=125] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=129] The Lord has made.
[time=131] I will rejoice.
[time=133] I will rejoice and be glad in me.
[time=137] And be glad in me.
[time=139] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=143] I will rejoice and be glad in me.
[time=147] This is the day.
[time=149] This is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=154] [MUSIC]
[time=158] I will enter his games with thanksgiving in my heart.
[time=161] I will enter his voice with praise.
[time=165] I will say, this is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=169] I will rejoice for his singing down.
[time=172] I will enter his games with thanksgiving in my heart.
[time=176] I will enter his voice with praise.
[time=180] I will say, this is the day that the Lord has made.
[time=185] I will rejoice for his singing down.
[time=189] [MUSIC - 50 seconds]
[time=250] [APPLAUSE]
[time=259] This month's special offer from the Bible Hour is a booklet by Charles Swindall.
[time=264] Fun is contagious.
[time=265] How to help your family lighten up.
[time=267] We're delighted to be able to offer you this booklet.
[time=270] Inside you'll find many creative ways to help relieve the stress that can take the fun from a family.
[time=275] To receive your copy, just drop us a note requesting the fun booklet.
[time=279] And if you can, please enclose a gift of any amount.
[time=282] Our address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=292] You've already heard our special guest musician Dan Tharleton sing for you.
[time=297] He's going to sing a number of times in our morning worship service.
[time=300] The privilege to meet him again was a number of years ago that I met him at a banquet in Salem, Oregon.
[time=305] We were across the table from each other and he was a young man just getting started and just singing career.
[time=311] Really enjoyed him, went out to a couple churches to hear his group sing.
[time=314] He eventually began singing with sunlight and now is in his own ministry.
[time=318] Met a young lady from this Midwest area and she persuaded him to move from the west coast to Indiana.
[time=325] Can you imagine that?
[time=327] They live in South Bend, Indiana and we're just delighted to have Dan here to minister to us.
[time=331] You'll note in his songs the ministry that he's had in his own life through trials and problems that have come
[time=339] and yet how God has used his ministry of music and those trials to help him write music that will help us in our difficulties.
[time=347] So would you please welcome him with a good Black Hawk welcome.
[time=350] (Applause)
[time=356] (Music)
[time=368] I will lay down my life, obediently, so that I might not be tempted away.
[time=380] From the one who loves me more than I even know, even though I have wandered astray.
[time=393] I followed so hard after success and all it did was leave me empty.
[time=405] But now I understand that the greatest command will one day make me holy.
[time=415] (Music)
[time=421] So that I can say now instead of living for myself I will lay down my life for a brother.
[time=432] In this world that says come do as you please even if it offends another.
[time=444] Well I tell you my friend when you come to the end of yourself and there's nowhere else to turn.
[time=457] I pray that you will see in Jesus and me that the most important thing we could ever learn is to love one another.
[time=475] More than we love ourselves, love one another, more than we love ourselves.
[time=492] Then the world will see and love that is real, living in you, living in me.
[time=505] (Music)
[time=516] In you and me, in you and me.
[time=527] (Music)
[time=549] In you and me, in us.
[time=562] (Music)
[time=586] I bring you greetings from the Bible hour today and I'm especially thankful to have the special musical guest Dan Tharleson with us.
[time=593] Dan was astute to mine a number of years ago when I was teaching in Oregon and I'm so thankful to see after a number of years out from the college that Dan is still serving God.
[time=604] We're really appreciative of those young people that prepare to serve the Lord and continue that ministry.
[time=609] I'm really encouraged by Dan and his musical ministry. You'll be hearing from him again in our service.
[time=615] We're just thankful that he has the opportunity to be here on the Bible hour today.
[time=620] I want to mention for those of you that are Founders Club members that you should have received a letter explaining ticket distribution for the living Christmas tree.
[time=628] You have a form that you should fill out and return to us just as soon as possible so that we can assure you that you'll receive the tickets for the day or evening that you want to come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=638] Then for those of you that are watching and you'd like to receive tickets, public distribution for free tickets for the living Christmas tree will be on Saturday, November 13th, beginning at 9 a.m. and lasting until the tickets are gone.
[time=654] So you need to be here early. You can receive up to eight tickets as you each adult that comes and that day is November 13th.
[time=663] We hope that you'll join with us. We'd love to see you here at the Living Christmas tree.
[time=669] And then a little earlier in our program you heard Jeff Carlson introduce our gift offer of the month.
[time=675] Fun is contagious. How to help your family lighten up. I hope you'll write for the booklet. It's a great little booklet and we all need to lighten up occasionally in our families.
[time=685] And this is an excellent book to help you do just that. So right into the Bible hour today.
[time=692] Our pastor Russell Moore is on a teaching assignment this weekend and we have a special guest. His name is Dr. Robert Neenheis.
[time=700] Dr. Neenheis is the vice president of Taylor University, Fort Wayne and he's most recently come from Michigan State University where he earned his doctorate and then began teaching there.
[time=711] We're delighted to have him preach this morning on the Bible hour and also we're delighted that he's a part of our family here in Fort Wayne.
[time=719] So you'll be hearing him just in just a moment. But before he speaks we're going to go back to the live portion with more music from our special musical guest Dan Thaldson.
[time=741] I seek to do the will of the one who's since under died, laid his life down for me to set this captive free, free from the chains within.
[time=769] All my past and praises and what would draw him to die for such a worm as I know how he loves me more than life.
[time=791] No other God has ever made this kind of prize. Oh to bear the shame of that day as he hung his head in humbly pray.
[time=806] Father not my will but yours is my desire to follow you more.
[time=818] Even if the cost is great, oh I'll follow till I see your face.
[time=828] Yes I'll battle till I see your face.
[time=846] And it's only for your grace that I stand here in this place.
[time=857] You've brought more into this life than these limits of time and space.
[time=867] Time to grow to know you more.
[time=872] Space to learn what living is for. How you bled and died for me for all my iniquity.
[time=887] And oh how you love me more than life.
[time=893] No other God has ever made this kind of prize. Oh to bear the shame of that day as he hung his head in humbly pray.
[time=908] Father not my will but yours is my desire to follow you more.
[time=920] Even if the cost is great, oh I'll follow till I see your face.
[time=930] Yes I'll battle till I see your face.
[time=957] I've been quite a number of years since I was at Black Hawk Baptist Church last.
[time=962] I think it was maybe 1981.
[time=966] And that last visit I distinctly remember because Chris came down from South Bend to meet me and we said at the fountain in this mall real close to here and talked about maybe God would have us to spend the rest of our lives together and that was his plan.
[time=983] We've experienced a lot with God. We've seen God do just many things that have been far more than we ever deserve.
[time=992] Of him showing his love, his grace and his mercy.
[time=995] Particularly this last couple of years we've seen God totally dismantle everything that we thought was so important to us to show us what were really important.
[time=1006] To begin to strip away and shed those things that we thought and put such high esteem in our job.
[time=1014] We owned part of a company and had a competitor hired two thirds of our people away and we lost that business.
[time=1020] We lost our house, we lost everything.
[time=1023] And I began to carry all of those things and that stress and that pressure.
[time=1028] It wasn't mine to carry because Jesus says to cast all our cares on me because I care for you.
[time=1035] We can take him at his word.
[time=1037] I let that stress and that pressure get to me even to the point of having a heart attack a week before I turned 35 in 1991.
[time=1045] All that to say this, all his allowance, all those experiences that he allowed us to experience was that he could reveal himself more to us, make himself more known to us.
[time=1059] And then through us to a whole world that isn't so much hurt and despair and they need to see in us the life of Jesus Christ, that love.
[time=1089] [MUSIC]
[time=1096] Riding your word is written of your love for this age.
[time=1106] Could it be true that it's you who's been speaking all along?
[time=1113] [MUSIC]
[time=1117] Written in each line on each page.
[time=1122] Spirit of God is here right now, just as with man of old.
[time=1133] Now your spirit witnesses of all your word has shown.
[time=1143] The more we know, the more we love to know you.
[time=1151] Oh, oh, oh, oh, the more we see, the more we love to see you.
[time=1165] The more we know, we grow to love you more.
[time=1175] [MUSIC]
[time=1183] Now you're right here in my soul, filling me and making me whole.
[time=1194] Feeling me with peace and love, I know you'll never let me go.
[time=1201] I know you'll never, never let me go, always right there by my side.
[time=1210] You're clapped in the right night, nothing will I fear as long as you are near.
[time=1223] Oh, oh, oh, the more we know, the more we love to know you.
[time=1233] Oh, oh, oh, the more we see, the more we love to see.
[time=1239] The more we know, the more we know, we grow to love you more.
[time=1256] Oh, oh, the more we know, the more we love to know you.
[time=1280] The more we know, we grow to love you more.
[time=1307] [MUSIC]
[time=1317] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1334] [MUSIC]
[time=1344] Thank you, Dan, for your ministry of music this morning.
[time=1349] Pastor Russ went to a build conference in Ames, Iowa this week and went on to California to speak to a group of young people.
[time=1356] You think about Russ and Heidi, please remember them in prayer as they minister there and return to us the first of the week.
[time=1363] I hope that we are pleased to introduce to you Dr. Bob Neenheis.
[time=1368] He's new to our community, formerly from Michigan, attended the University of Michigan, got his degree there and then taught for a number of years.
[time=1376] Has been a pastor and now is the Vice President of Taylor University in Fort Wayne.
[time=1381] I want to tell you that we have a great friend already in Dr. Neenheis and one that is going to influence our community.
[time=1388] I'm certain for the Lord through his ministry at Taylor University.
[time=1392] I'm so glad that he's here today to speak to you and he'll be here again this evening.
[time=1396] I hope you'll come back tonight at six o'clock and be with us for that service too.
[time=1400] Again, would you give Dr. Neenheis a good Black Hawk welcome as he comes to the pulpit today.
[time=1405] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1416] It's good to be here this morning. I'm grateful for the opportunity of sharing the Word of God with you today.
[time=1422] Words have extreme power.
[time=1426] They can bring forth images to our mind. They can recall memories.
[time=1430] The mere mention of a word can send us off on a trip in our mind that would last some time.
[time=1438] I'm a little Dutch boy. I grew up in Holland, Michigan.
[time=1442] On the west side of Michigan, if you say the word Dutchman, people know immediately what that means.
[time=1449] It means that you're tight and bullheaded.
[time=1452] Now, we who are Dutchman think of it as being frugal and tenacious, but you only have to say the word Dutchman and people have all kinds of mental images.
[time=1462] If I said the word rainbow, I'm sure that brings back to your mind a memory of a rainbow.
[time=1469] It may have been one that was particularly vivid or special because of the circumstances.
[time=1477] Say the word famine.
[time=1479] And you think of the mental images that we have seen in our television screens of small children and adults
[time=1485] who are struggling because they simply don't have food.
[time=1491] And in a group like this, say the word evangelism.
[time=1496] And people probably have one of three responses. One might be guilt.
[time=1502] Another might be excuses.
[time=1505] Or a third would simply be pain.
[time=1510] Guilt because we know we should be doing more in evangelism than we are.
[time=1515] We know we should be doing more about proclaiming Christ and we're simply not doing it.
[time=1521] And so we feel guilty about what's not happening.
[time=1525] There may be excuses because we know we're not doing it.
[time=1529] And we're trying to be creative in coming up with ways that we really don't have to do it.
[time=1533] And so people say, well, it's not my gift.
[time=1537] If it were my gift, of course I would be doing it.
[time=1540] But it's not my gift, therefore I'm not doing it and I don't have to do it.
[time=1545] Or people say, well, I am a witness, but I'm a silent witness.
[time=1551] Well, that's good. We all need to be living by our lifestyle a testimony to Jesus Christ.
[time=1556] But at some point we have to go from that silent witness to a verbal witness.
[time=1562] And excuses don't help us there.
[time=1565] And some people simply feel pain because they have in their own family or in their own circle of acquaintances.
[time=1572] People who have died without Christ and they feel the pain of those losses.
[time=1579] And knowing that they died without a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=1583] I have no desire today to add to your guilt. That's God's business.
[time=1588] If he wants to make you feel guilty about what you're not doing, that's his business.
[time=1592] And we probably all need a little guilt to motivate us to do what we ought to do.
[time=1597] Nor is it my intent this morning to give you new excuses for not doing what you should really be doing.
[time=1603] And I certainly am not going to try to add to the pain that you already feel.
[time=1608] If you have family and friends who have died without Christ.
[time=1613] Although I think sometimes that kind of pain does really motivate us to share Christ with people.
[time=1621] Rather my desire today is first to remind you of what we probably would all agree on.
[time=1628] The fact that as Christians we are called to do the work of evangelism.
[time=1633] It's not an optional item in our life.
[time=1637] It is something that we as believers must give ourselves to.
[time=1641] Jesus said in Matthew 28 verses 19 and 20, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[time=1650] and teaching them all that I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[time=1657] It was the great commission.
[time=1659] We use that at mission conferences to send missionaries around the world.
[time=1662] But we also must recognize that that great commission calls us to ministry in our own community.
[time=1668] Within our own families, into our workplaces and our neighborhoods.
[time=1674] The Apostle Paul restated that same charge in a little different term when he wrote in 2 Corinthians 5 beginning in verse 18.
[time=1685] All these things are from God who reconciles to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself,
[time=1695] not counting their trespasses against them.
[time=1698] And he is committed to us, the word of reconciliation.
[time=1702] Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ.
[time=1705] As though God were entreating through us, we beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
[time=1713] So whether it's Christ's great commission or Paul's charge to us as ambassadors of God
[time=1719] to proclaim the message of reconciliation through Jesus Christ, we as Christians are to be about the work of evangelism.
[time=1728] And now we turn to John chapter 1.
[time=1731] And I'd like you to turn there with me, please.
[time=1734] John 1 beginning at verse 35, where I believe we find three principles to guide and encourage us
[time=1742] as we get on with doing the work of evangelism.
[time=1751] As those who have been called to do evangelism, we need to know how to do it and why to do it.
[time=1760] John chapter 1 beginning at verse 35.
[time=1763] Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples and he looked upon Jesus as he walked and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God," and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed Jesus.
[time=1774] And Jesus turned and beheld them following and said to them, "What do you seek?" And they said to him, "Rabbi," which translated means teacher, "Where are you staying?"
[time=1786] He said to them, "Come and you will see." They came therefore and saw where he was staying and they stayed with him that day before it was about the tenth hour.
[time=1795] One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
[time=1800] He found first his own brother Simon and said to him, "We have found the Messiah," which translated means Christ.
[time=1807] He brought him to Jesus.
[time=1809] Jesus looked at him and said, "You are Simon, the Son of John.
[time=1812] You shall be called Cephas," which translated means Peter.
[time=1817] The next day he purposed to go forth into Galilee and he found Philip.
[time=1821] And Jesus said to him, "Follow me." Now Philip was from Bethsaida of the city of Andrew and Peter.
[time=1828] Philip found Nathaniel and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote."
[time=1834] Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph, and Nathaniel said to him, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
[time=1842] Philip said to him, "Come and see." Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and said to him, "Behold and Israelite in whom is no guile."
[time=1853] Nathaniel said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
[time=1863] Nathaniel answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel."
[time=1871] Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe?
[time=1876] You shall see greater things than these." And he said to him, "Truly, I say to you, you shall see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man."
[time=1888] What can we say about evangelism?
[time=1891] We acknowledge the fact that we as believers are to be involved in the work of evangelism, but what can we now say about that involvement?
[time=1899] How must we go about this?
[time=1901] Well, recognize first of all that our involvement in evangelism begins with a personal encounter with Jesus Christ.
[time=1909] Involvement in evangelism must begin with a personal encounter with Christ.
[time=1914] You see, you simply cannot share effectively what you have not experienced personally.
[time=1921] When we were living in the Lansing area, I was on a quest. I was in search of the perfect wet burrito.
[time=1932] Now, you may have never gone after the perfect wet burrito, but I have.
[time=1936] And I'm here to tell you, there's a little place called the wooden nickel in Danzville, which does a wonderful job of putting out a wet burrito.
[time=1944] We were invited there by some friends who knew of my personal journey.
[time=1949] And they said, "Now, when you go here with us, you need to understand that this is not a fancy place.
[time=1954] In fact, it's kind of a dive.
[time=1957] And if you don't have holes in your flannel shirt, you're overdressed.
[time=1961] But they've got great wet burritos.
[time=1964] So we went there one night with some couples.
[time=1967] We ordered the wet burrito, 595 at the time, and they brought it out, and it's falling off the plate.
[time=1975] There's cheese, and lettuce, and all the hot stuff that you put on top of wet burritos.
[time=1981] And it was just huge. And it was wonderful. And I ate the whole thing.
[time=1988] I had a great time with that wet burrito, and every time we'd go back, I'd eat that wet burrito with great vigor.
[time=1995] Sometimes it was so big I couldn't eat the whole thing, and I had to take some home and have it the next day.
[time=1999] What a tragedy.
[time=2001] But even as we talk about it, it brings back images in my mind of the wet burrito as it laps over the edges of the plate.
[time=2008] And I can almost taste it.
[time=2011] Now, before we left Lansing, I found out that there was a new place in town called Pancharos.
[time=2017] Pancharos also advertised wet burritos. In fact, they advertised a 2-pound wet burrito.
[time=2025] I've never been to pancharos. I've never had their 2-pound wet burrito.
[time=2029] People have been there and said, "It's pretty good." But I couldn't tell you that for certain because I've not been there. I've not experienced it.
[time=2036] Wooden nickel, however, I have experienced on more than a couple of occasions.
[time=2043] You see the difference between talking about something you know and something you only heard about?
[time=2049] I would imagine that in your mind, you conjured up a much more vivid picture of a wet burrito based on the wooden nickel experience
[time=2056] than you ever could based on Pancharos.
[time=2060] Imagine then trying to proclaim Jesus Christ without having first experienced Him in your own life.
[time=2066] It will simply not be all that appealing.
[time=2072] Our involvement in evangelism must begin with a personal encounter with Jesus Christ.
[time=2077] That's what's happening in John chapter 1.
[time=2080] Andrew is a follower of John the Baptist.
[time=2083] He had heard John the Baptist speak on more than a few occasions of the one who was to come after him.
[time=2089] The one whose sandals he was not worthy to loosen and tie.
[time=2095] And then John one day says, "There he is." And Andrew immediately begins to follow after Jesus.
[time=2104] And he asks him, I think, a rather curious question, verse 38.
[time=2109] Rabbi, where are you staying?
[time=2115] Are you staying at the Holiday Inn or at the Romada?
[time=2119] Are you at the bed and breakfast over here?
[time=2121] Are you staying in the park?
[time=2124] Where are you staying?
[time=2126] That's not really what he's asking. He's not asking for an address. He's not being nosy at that point.
[time=2130] What he's really saying is, how can I spend time with you?
[time=2135] I have some things I want to try to understand. How can I spend some time with you?
[time=2140] And Jesus said, come on, come on.
[time=2143] Now we know from the Scripture that they stayed with him well into the evening because the tenth hour, verse 39, is about four o'clock in the afternoon.
[time=2153] And they must have talked for a long time, although none of the conversation is recorded in Scripture.
[time=2158] Because the next morning Andrew goes out and tells his brother Simon, verse 41, we have found the Messiah.
[time=2167] Somewhere in the course of that conversation about Jesus and who he is and what his mission is,
[time=2173] Andrew becomes convinced of who Jesus is.
[time=2178] Philip also has an encounter with Christ in John chapter 1.
[time=2183] Unlike Andrew who sought out Jesus and said, how can I talk with you?
[time=2187] Philip was going about his activities. Jesus came by and said, follow me.
[time=2193] And Philip begins to follow after Jesus, and they too must have shared some kind of conversation together
[time=2199] because like Andrew, Philip goes out and finds Nathaniel.
[time=2204] That conversation is not recorded for us, but it must have included something with the Old Testament prophecies
[time=2211] because when Philip goes to Nathaniel, he says to him, verse 45, we have found him of whom Moses in the law
[time=2218] and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of Joseph.
[time=2224] Now I want you to notice one thing just briefly with me, the difference in the way that Philip and Andrew encounter Christ.
[time=2233] Andrew is kind of out of quest and he finds Christ and gets his questions answered
[time=2240] and becomes convinced that he is the Messiah.
[time=2242] Philip is going about his activities. He certainly was looking, he was knowledgeable of the Scriptures.
[time=2247] But Christ comes to him and says, follow me.
[time=2251] There's no one way to come to Christ.
[time=2256] If there is, then unless you were 16 and walked the sawdust trail in the Billy Sunday tabernacle, you're not a Christian because that's how I came to Christ.
[time=2264] And if that's the only way to do it, then you have to have walked that same trail or your conversion isn't valid.
[time=2270] But the truth is, some of you have never been to the Billy Sunday tabernacle.
[time=2276] And you've never walked the sawdust trail. You may have walked the carpeted path.
[time=2280] You may have knelt in a dormitory room or in a living room or in the quiet of a moment by yourself.
[time=2289] You yielded your heart to Jesus Christ. There's no one way to come to Christ.
[time=2294] There is one way to find salvation that is through Christ.
[time=2298] But we've all come by different routes at different ages through different circumstances.
[time=2304] The key is not how you come to Christ. The key is that you have indeed come to Christ.
[time=2311] To be involved in evangelism, you must have had a personal encounter with Christ.
[time=2317] It seems obvious, but there are some people who will try to share Christ without having really experienced Him.
[time=2322] It may be because they want to please their parents or to gain some measure of relationship with people.
[time=2331] It may be because they feel guilty. They've been hanging around the church for a long time and feel like they have to do this.
[time=2337] But unless you have trusted in Christ, unless you're convinced that He is God the Son, that He has died to pay the penalty for your sin, that He has given to you the gift of eternal life
[time=2348] and that He is Lord of your earthly life.
[time=2351] Unless all of that is a part of your own experience, you have nothing to share.
[time=2357] If, however, you have a relationship with Christ, then it's a relationship to be shared.
[time=2366] Our involvement in evangelism begins with a personal encounter with Christ.
[time=2372] But our involvement in evangelism then demands personal contact with unbelievers.
[time=2379] You see, good news is no fun unless you have someone with whom you can share it.
[time=2384] The good in good news is the opportunity to tell other people and have them celebrate it with you.
[time=2391] When a young man and a young woman get engaged, it's part of the celebration to tell everybody about it.
[time=2400] That's the way it was in our relationship with Betty Jo and I.
[time=2402] I am the last of the great sentimentalists. Betty Jo and I were dating.
[time=2408] I was working with Youth for Christ in Holland, Michigan. She was a nurse's training in Kalamazoo.
[time=2413] And I was burning up the road a fair amount of time building this relationship and we had talked about marriage.
[time=2418] One day I went to pick her up and we got in the car and she said, "Where are we going to go?" And I said, "Well, you'll know. We'll just go." And so we started out and we were riding down the road and she said, "Where are we going?"
[time=2431] I said, "I thought we'd go to Holland." Now I understand I had just come from Holland.
[time=2436] I drove an hour to Kalamazoo to pick up Betty Jo and now we're going to drive back to Holland, which means I'm going to have to drive her back to Kalamazoo and still drive home to Holland.
[time=2444] That's four hours on a road. That's love. I want you to know.
[time=2448] So we're driving. She said, "Why are we going to Holland?" And this is where it really gets juicy.
[time=2455] So I reached down alongside of the car seat and I presented her with a diamond and I said,
[time=2461] "To show your mother this." Now how many people get engaged at 65 miles an hour on the expressway?
[time=2467] Is that not touching?
[time=2470] Some of you are moved to tears. I can tell already.
[time=2474] But why would we go to Holland at all? It's that she could go and tell her parents and her sisters that we're engaged and that we're going to get married.
[time=2481] I have never yet met a woman who was recently engaged who walks around with her arm, with her hand covered.
[time=2488] Instead, it's kind of like, "Hi!" Because that's the celebration that deserves to be exploded for everyone to join.
[time=2499] Are there any golfers here? And if you folks play golf, a couple of you do.
[time=2503] Some of you are saying, "Do I dare raise my hand?" Have you ever had a hole in one? Not in the miniature golf course.
[time=2514] You have? All right. Do you tell anybody about it?
[time=2519] Yeah. If you have a hole in one, you want everybody to know.
[time=2524] Now, you want to know what the definition of a dilemma is?
[time=2530] The Christian who plays golf at 11 o'clock on Sunday morning and has a hole in one?
[time=2537] Who do you tell?
[time=2542] Good news is for sharing. It's for celebrating. You want everybody to know.
[time=2549] Listen, if you're a Christian, if you've trusted in Jesus Christ, you've experienced the best news that anyone can ever tell.
[time=2557] So tell it. Share it. Proclaim it.
[time=2562] Get the word out. Jesus Christ is changing lives. He's changed mine and he wants to change yours.
[time=2574] That's exactly what's happening in John chapter 1. John the Baptist shares with Andrew, who shares with Simon.
[time=2582] Jesus shares with Philip, who shares with Nathaniel. Listen, if you're not sharing the good news, which is gospel, if you're not sharing the gospel, I don't believe you're doing what God wants you to do.
[time=2595] I think it's that straightforward.
[time=2598] That, of course, raises the question with whom do I share? Well, the text helps us there. Look at verse 41.
[time=2607] Andrew, having become convinced that Jesus is the Messiah, goes and finds Simon, who is his brother.
[time=2615] He looked around and said, "Who do I know that needs to hear this good news?" Well, there's my brother.
[time=2624] We can be sharing the good news with family members who don't know Christ.
[time=2630] Philip becomes convinced that Jesus is the Messiah.
[time=2637] And he looks around and says, "Whom can I tell?" Verse 45, "Philip found Nathaniel, who was a friend, and he shared his convictions with his friend.
[time=2650] And we can share Christ with our friends." We share Christ with family members. We share Christ with friends.
[time=2660] And sometimes Christians come and say, "You know, I'd be happy to be a witness, but I don't know any unbelievers."
[time=2669] And you know what my response is to you? Then what good are you?
[time=2674] What purpose are you serving if you're just sitting here waiting for God to take you home?
[time=2680] Why do you think you're here just to take up space for a while to occupy a pew at Black Hawk Baptist Church for a few Sundays until he takes you home?
[time=2691] This is a great place, but God didn't save us so that we can come and congratulate one another on the great thing that God has done for us and then kind of hold hands until he takes us home.
[time=2701] I believe he's left us here so that between Sundays we can be sharing the good news with people who don't yet know Christ.
[time=2712] That's why we're here. He could have taken us home. He could save us and zap us out of here.
[time=2718] But he didn't. Instead he said, "Go and make disciples." He said, "Be ambassadors, proclaim the message of reconciliation." Don't just pat each other on the back saying, "Isn't it wonderful that we're going to be able to be together for all eternity?" It is wonderful, but let's see if we can't fill it up a little bit more.
[time=2737] There are people who are without Christ that you know family members and friends who need to hear the message of reconciliation.
[time=2750] And you're the one to bring it because they know you and you know them.
[time=2756] And if you really don't know any unbelievers, then take a walk this afternoon around your neighborhood.
[time=2765] And when you see somebody outside begin to strike up a conversation, my guess is you'll be able to find some unbelievers in your neighborhood.
[time=2774] If you live in a total Christian commune, unlikely, but if you do, then I suggest that as you get to work or school or into the store tomorrow,
[time=2786] that you strike up a conversation with someone, chances are they'll be an unbeliever, and you'll be able to begin to build a redemptive relationship.
[time=2796] As a new resident of Fort Wayne, I've come to know that this is called the City of Churches.
[time=2801] That's good, but it is not yet the City of all Christians.
[time=2807] And there's work for us to do.
[time=2810] Now don't ask someone else to do your work for you.
[time=2814] Don't be like the person that came to me one day and said, "Pastor, would you go visit my neighbor?" She's in the hospital, and I just know that she'd love to have you visit.
[time=2821] And I'm sure that if you shared the gospel with her, that she'd want to become a Christian.
[time=2826] When I answered a couple of questions for me, please, are you and your neighbor acquainted?
[time=2834] Oh, yes, of course.
[time=2836] And she knows who you are and what you believe.
[time=2839] Oh, yes, we've lived next door to each other for years.
[time=2843] Have you ever shared the gospel with her?
[time=2845] Well, no, I haven't.
[time=2847] I said, "I'll tell you what.
[time=2849] Since your neighbor knows you and has watched your life for all those years, I think that your message would be far more effective than mine because she doesn't know me." And she just thinks that he's just saying what he has to say because he's paid to be the pastor.
[time=2865] Why don't you and I meet, we'll talk a little about what you should say.
[time=2868] I'll go with you to the hospital to visit your neighbor, but you talk to her.
[time=2873] Because your message would be far more important than mine.
[time=2878] She already knows you.
[time=2881] Have you built redemptive relationships with unbelievers?
[time=2885] Have you reached out to those in your neighborhood, in your workplace, in your carpool, in your classroom, to begin to touch them with the gospel of Jesus Christ?
[time=2894] If not, what good are you?
[time=2897] I say that in love, but I say that to get at you a bit as well, my friends, because I really believe that's part of why we're here.
[time=2907] There are people all around us who need to hear the good news.
[time=2911] And we know it.
[time=2913] And we must share it.
[time=2916] And I challenge you to build redemptive relationships because our involvement in evangelism demands personal contact with unbelievers.
[time=2925] And then realize finally that our involvement in evangelism results in changed lives.
[time=2932] Before I became a Christian, my whole life revolved around one thing.
[time=2936] Building myself up.
[time=2939] Everything that I did was designed to help build me up in the eyes of others.
[time=2944] So my involvement in sports, my involvement in music, my involvement in student leadership activities
[time=2950] were all designed to build me up.
[time=2952] I was very egocentric.
[time=2955] I was only concerned about me and how I appeared to others.
[time=2960] I freely used people and circumstances to advance my own case.
[time=2969] Then I trusted in Jesus Christ.
[time=2972] And he began to point out in my own life some of the ways that I was using people.
[time=2978] And the focus that I had on me instead of on him and on others.
[time=2985] There were two changes that took place when I trusted in Jesus Christ.
[time=2989] One was instant.
[time=2991] When I trusted in Jesus Christ, he changed me from a lost sinner to a forgiven saint.
[time=2999] He promised me life eternal and a place in heaven when I died.
[time=3004] The other change is an ongoing change.
[time=3008] It's the kind of transformation that is still being worked out in my life where God uses people and circumstances to continue to shape me into his own image.
[time=3018] Evangelism results in changed lives.
[time=3021] If you begin to share Christ with unbelievers, you will become a different person.
[time=3027] It just happens that way.
[time=3029] As we give of ourselves in ministry to other people, it changes us.
[time=3034] Our priorities become different.
[time=3038] Our life becomes different.
[time=3043] But it also changes other people.
[time=3046] For those who trust in Jesus Christ become new creations in Christ Jesus.
[time=3050] And I see that happening in John chapter 1.
[time=3054] Simon is introduced to Christ by his brother Andrew.
[time=3059] And Jesus, verse 42, looks at Simon and says, "You are Simon the Son of John.
[time=3063] You shall be called Cephas." What did a change mean for Simon?
[time=3068] It meant a new name.
[time=3071] He goes from being just Simon to being Cephas, Peter, the rock.
[time=3078] And if you want to imagine the kind of transformation that that meant for him, then I challenge you to think about what we know of old Peter.
[time=3087] Peter, the bluster, or the impulsive one.
[time=3092] The one who took his foot out of his mouth only long enough to put the other one in.
[time=3096] That's Peter.
[time=3098] We see him always saying the wrong thing at the wrong time.
[time=3103] But then go over and read first and second Peter.
[time=3106] And notice the changes there.
[time=3109] The transformation of Peter is a dramatic one.
[time=3113] As he goes from being the impulsive headstrong fisherman to the humble servant of Jesus Christ.
[time=3120] That we read about Peter 1 and 2.
[time=3124] Or Nathaniel.
[time=3125] Nathaniel was changed.
[time=3128] He was given a whole new hope.
[time=3132] To Nathaniel Jesus says, "Because I said that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe you shall see greater things than these." Verse 51, "Truly I say to you, you shall see the heavens opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man." Here was this already religious Nathaniel who's going to have a whole new understanding of what it means to walk in fellowship with a living God.
[time=3158] Listen friends, the confident hope of evangelism for the believer is changed lives.
[time=3166] A changed life for the one who shares Christ.
[time=3170] And a changed life for the one who hears the message of reconciliation.
[time=3177] I think scripture is clear and my guess is we would probably be almost unanimous that as Christians we must be involved in the work of evangelism.
[time=3187] It begins with a personal encounter with Jesus Christ.
[time=3191] I don't assume for a moment that just because you are here this morning you have already put your trust in Christ.
[time=3197] I say that because I know from my own experience that I was very involved in a variety of church and parachurch ministries as a teenager never having trusted in Christ.
[time=3207] And if you've never put your trust in Christ that's the beginning point for you today.
[time=3214] That's where it starts.
[time=3216] You acknowledge him as Savior and Lord and seek to begin a lifelong relationship with a living God.
[time=3223] But if you have already had that personal encounter with Christ then I remind you that involvement in evangelism demands contact with unbelievers to go out and build redemptive relationships with the expectation of changed lives
[time=3238] yours, the evangelist and the ones with whom you share Christ.
[time=3245] There was a great song that a lot of us would sing at campfires in the 60s and 70s.
[time=3251] It's page 300 in your hymnal.
[time=3253] I'd like you to turn there for a moment.
[time=3256] And I want to look at the words to that song with you.
[time=3264] The song is I'll tell the world that I'm a Christian.
[time=3271] We sing a lot of songs without ever really paying attention to the words.
[time=3276] If you're like me you've sung that song dozens of times I'll tell the world that I'm a Christian.
[time=3284] But are we?
[time=3285] Are we telling the world that we're Christians?
[time=3288] We'll tell the world almost anything.
[time=3290] We'll tell them that we are bankers, that we're school teachers, that we're parents, that we're rich, that we're poor, that we're bright, that we're not.
[time=3299] We'll tell them that we're upwardly mobile, that we're downwardly mobile.
[time=3303] We'll tell them almost anything.
[time=3305] But don't ask us to tell them that we're Christians because we're not sure how they'll react to that.
[time=3310] They may make fun of us.
[time=3313] They may not want to be around us.
[time=3317] I'll tell the world that I'm a what?
[time=3320] I think the song is right.
[time=3322] I'll tell the world that I'm a Christian.
[time=3324] I'm not ashamed, his name to bear.
[time=3326] I'll tell the world that I'm a Christian.
[time=3328] I'll take him with me anywhere.
[time=3330] I'll tell the world how Jesus saved me and how he gave me a life brand new.
[time=3335] And I know that if you trust him, that all he gave me, he'll give to you.
[time=3341] I'll tell the world that he's my savior.
[time=3343] No other one could love me so.
[time=3345] My life, my all is his forever.
[time=3349] And where he leads me, I will go.
[time=3352] The world doesn't need more Christians who sing songs that they don't intend to obey.
[time=3359] What the world needs is more Christians who will stand up and say, "I'll tell the world.
[time=3364] I'll tell my world, my neighborhood, my workplace, my friends at school.
[time=3369] I'll tell the world that I'm a Christian." And the work that Christ has done in my life, he will do in theirs.
[time=3378] I challenge you, my friends, as I challenge myself.
[time=3382] Let's be about the work of evangelism.
[time=3386] It's why we're here.
[time=3388] Let's be building those redemptive relationships which will enable us to share Christ with those who are lost.
[time=3397] And let's do it until Jesus comes.
[time=3401] Let's pray, please.
[time=3415] To come to the close of another Bible hour, I hope you've enjoyed the music from our sanctuary choir and special guest, Dan Thorlson.
[time=3423] The message today was from Dr. Robert Neenheist.
[time=3426] Dr. Neenheist is the vice president at Taylor University in Fort Wayne.
[time=3431] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your savior, rededicate your life to Christ.
[time=3438] Just before we close, I'd like to pray this prayer with you.
[time=3441] Dear Heavenly Father, there are times when I need to come to you and ask you for forgiveness of the sins that I've committed and rejuvenate my life.
[time=3451] I know you as my personal savior, but I want you to live in my life again.
[time=3457] And then, Lord, there might be others that need to say, "Lord, I'm a sinner, and I've never accepted you as my personal savior, and I'd like to have you come into my heart today.
[time=3466] Would you please come in and forgive me of the sins that I've committed?" In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3473] If you prayed that prayer with me today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3478] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
