[time=0] We live in a society that is highly materialistic and self-serving and hedonistic and most of
[time=29] the decisions being made by most of the people in our culture is based around one question and one question alone.
[time=36] Is this really what I want?
[time=51] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=58] find to be an encouragement.
[time=60] Thank you for joining us.
[time=62] Which is the most Christ-like attitude to be found on earth?
[time=65] Love?
[time=66] Patience?
[time=67] Forgiveness?
[time=68] Grace?
[time=69] Oh Christ gives us the answer to our question in Matthew 11, 29 when he says, "I am gentle
[time=76] and humble in heart." The most Christ-like attitude on earth is unselfishness and this morning we come to a text that explains the selflessness of Christ and calls us to be just like him.
[time=89] Our special music today will be provided by the Handbell Choir and a duet by Kevin
[time=98] Rowe and Denise Mitchell.
[time=103] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=113] And I saw a new Kevin and a new earth for the first Kevin and the first earth who
[time=137] passed awake, and there was no more sea, no more sea, no more sea.
[time=159] And I've jumped on the Holy City, new Jerusalem, running down the road of hell.
[time=176] And I've heard a prayer as a riot wall for a sad, and I've heard a pray for every audience, a voice of a fellow saying.
[time=202] We hope the tenderness of God is with men, and it will bow the land they shall be saved on, and God is out shall be fed.
[time=223] Let me bear God.
[time=253] There shall be no more death, there shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more crying.
[time=266] There shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more crying.
[time=294] There shall be no more things, there shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more sorrow, there shall be no more sorrow.

[time=389] [MUSIC - 86 seconds]
[time=483] Well thank you for watching the Bible Hour today. If you're a member of the Founders Club, I'd like to remind you that you should have received a letter concerning the living Christmas tree tickets that are available to you.
[time=495] You receive the letter as well as a card and a return envelope requesting tickets. I hope that you'll send that card back right away so that we can get your ticket requests in the mail back to you.
[time=507] The final date for those requests is November 8th. I know that's a little ways away from the concerts, but in order to process everything and to ensure you of the night or day that you'd like to come to the living Christmas tree, we have to do this well in advance.
[time=521] So just a reminder, don't forget to get your ticket requests back to us as soon as possible. And then I'd like to remind those of you that are watching the Bible Hour today that we have a public distribution for living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=534] They're free, but you need to come here on November 13th. We begin distributing the tickets at 9 a.m. and give them out until they're all gone. So it might be noon or it might be 3 o'clock.
[time=546] You need to come and you can receive up to 8 tickets as an adult if you'll come that day to the Blackhawk Baptist Church. And remember that date again is November 13th.
[time=558] Our pastor Russell Moore was gone last week and Russ, we're glad to have you back here today.
[time=564] Well, thank you. And it's good to hear you're promoting the living Christmas tree. I can hardly wait for that time of year to come again and all the people that will come and share that event with us.
[time=572] Well, you know, last weekend Russ, we had our retreat, which is the choir getting together and hearing the music for the first time. And that's always kind of a nervous evening for me because I want the people to respond positively to the music.
[time=585] And I think our choir is pretty excited about the music that we have and the message we have. We're calling it Jesus the Heart of Christmas. I think it's going to be a great concert this year.
[time=593] Well, I'm excited to be a part of it too.
[time=596] Now, my last week I was in Ames, Iowa. I began there at a conference on lay leadership development. And there's some new curriculum out called Build.
[time=605] And it's produced by a local church to develop lay leaders in the church. And it's going very, very well, as you know, in our own church.
[time=612] We have about, well, most of our leadership team, our elders and our deacons are now beginning to move into that material.
[time=618] And we're seeing that it's very effective and training men in the Word and in ministry skills.
[time=624] And then I went from there to California for about four days. And I had an opportunity to speak at a college camp.
[time=630] A bunch of students from USC and UCLA and Northridge out in the Southern California area.
[time=636] And talked to them about the Great Commission and evangelism and discipleship. And I really think the Lord was working there, so I'm thankful for that.
[time=644] I don't think there's anything more exciting than to be among college students, particularly at a retreat.
[time=649] They're just invigorating and they make you feel really youthful.
[time=653] Yeah, their whole life is in front of them and they have all the idealism that has yet to be tempered by the hard knocks of life.
[time=659] And so they're an exciting group to try to challenge.
[time=662] And I'm also thankful, Russ, too, that our church is built on lay leadership.
[time=667] We have a number of men in the business world that are so active in our churches as lay leaders.
[time=673] And we're really thankful for that. I don't think we could exist without that.
[time=677] I don't either. A church is really established by the strength of its voluntary lay leadership.
[time=683] And the guys that are doing that here are really committed and they're very solid.
[time=689] They're very privileged to work with them.
[time=692] If you're watching the Bible Hour today and you're a member of one of our local churches, let us encourage you to go to your pastor or your leaders
[time=699] and ask them what you can do in your local church to help the cause there.
[time=704] We really encourage you to do that. When you get involved with people, you talk about the Christian life coming alive.
[time=710] It's really exciting to work with people. It's not easy. Sometimes the road gets kind of rough, but the rewards are great.
[time=718] You're a local pastor today and tell them that you're ready to help out in your church and ask them what you can do for the cause of Christ.
[time=726] A little earlier in our program, you were introduced to the book Fun is Contagious.
[time=731] By Jeff Carlson, it's a humorous book and it's written by Chuck Swindall.
[time=737] I hope you'll write for it today. I want to give you the address one more time where you can receive this book absolutely free.
[time=744] Just write to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=762] I want to encourage you to stay tuned to the Bible Hour next week as we'll have special guests from Cedarville College.
[time=769] Their string orchestra will be joining our orchestra and choir for some special music.
[time=774] I think you'll be inspired by that. Our pastor will continue his ministry in the Book of Philippians.
[time=780] I hope you'll stay tuned each week for the Bible Hour and send those letters and cards letting us know that you're watching us.
[time=799] I'll follow the sparrow to the ground, follow the road to where we're bound.
[time=816] They search when we're lost until we're found.
[time=826] Here's our new sea to the flower in the field.
[time=834] We see through each envelope we've seen.
[time=840] They see through the strongest walls we build.
[time=850] Oh, may I be pleasing to see when holy hives gaze upon me.
[time=862] Oh, may I be pleasing to see in his eyes.
[time=880] Here's our new sea through the deepest ice night.
[time=891] Into my heart and soul through their side.
[time=897] They turn from the wrong to love that's right.
[time=907] And his eyes leap from the throne of love and grace.
[time=915] Look through the rim of time and space to find in our heart each secret place.
[time=930] Oh, may I be pleasing to see when holy hives gaze upon me.
[time=942] Oh, may I be pleasing to see in his eyes.
[time=954] Oh, may I be pleasing to see when holy hives gaze upon me.
[time=966] Oh, may I be pleasing to see in his eyes.
[time=983] I am pleasing to see in his eyes.
[time=996] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1003] Thank you, Kevin and Denise.
[time=1005] Aren't we blessed here with the music ministry, the choir as they sang this morning and the bells and then the special music.
[time=1011] It's a real privilege and we're thankful.
[time=1015] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bibles and come to the book of Philippians and turn to chapter 2.
[time=1022] About a month and a half ago we began a study of the book of Philippians and we are marching our way through the text which God has presented before us to try to understand the word of God.
[time=1034] And we come this morning to chapter 2 verses 1 through 11 and we'll look basically at all these verses this morning but I want to begin by reading verses 3 through 4.
[time=1046] And I guess I have to confess that it was a difficult week for me to study this passage because the standard is so high in this passage.
[time=1057] And it is tied to the work and ministry of Christ and the example that he set that there was a sense in me which recoiled from the truth in the passage and said I can't do this, I can't live like this, this is too much, I'm confused, it's beyond me.
[time=1074] And I think as I read these verses if you're honest in your heart you may find the same feelings filling your heart in mind but we'll bring ourselves to it and ask the Spirit of God to minister to us.
[time=1086] Even though the standard is remarkably high, Philippians chapter 2 verse 3.
[time=1092] Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[time=1099] But with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than himself.
[time=1105] Do not merely look out for your own personal interests but also for the interests of others.
[time=1112] That's remarkable. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit.
[time=1117] And as I was thinking about that I oftentimes will come home at the end of the day and Heidi will be tired and somewhat frustrated and the kids will have been kids and life will have been life.
[time=1127] And I was kind of thinking about relaxing and resting and a lot of times I'll engage in the activity right there and help out with dinner and maybe do the dishes and it really has nothing to do with Heidi and ministering to her or helping the kids.
[time=1141] It has everything to do with the assumption or the hope or the belief that if I kick in for the first hour and a half of the evening I can get the next two for myself.
[time=1149] Do you understand what I'm talking about?
[time=1151] When I honestly look at my life and I hear somebody say do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit I must confess that there are a lot of nice and good and moral activities that fill my life.
[time=1164] And if the truth were known and if I were honest with myself it has everything to do with me and very little to do with the people I am appearing to serve.
[time=1172] So it cuts past the facade of my life.
[time=1176] And then it goes on with bold audacity to say that I should regard one another or other people as more important than myself.
[time=1186] I love me a lot. I think a lot about myself and I'll be honest with you my reflex reaction to situations and issues in my life that could cause me damage or suffer not just physically but my free time or my reputation or my ministry or my income or whatever it is.
[time=1206] I pretty reflexively think about me as being more important than somebody else.
[time=1212] So again it goes past what other people see about me and maybe people are perceptive and can see that I don't know but I know it goes right to my heart.
[time=1221] And then in the end of verse four but also for the interests of others.
[time=1225] There is a need to look out for my own personal interests but the flavor I get from this text is only to the degree I should look out for my own personal interests only to the degree that I can effectively serve everybody else.
[time=1239] And so even when I'm looking out for me I'm looking out for other people or at least that's what the text seems to demand.
[time=1247] That's an interesting experience this week and that's one of the blessings of going away. You change the pace and I went to this leadership conference for leaders in the church.
[time=1257] It was held in Ames, Iowa and I was greeted with a wonderful surprise.
[time=1260] I walked through the main door and into the lobby and there was Dr. Mark Mueller one of my in fact my favorite theological professor when I was at Talbot Theological Seminary.
[time=1271] I took all of my theologies from him. Absolutely brilliant man knows the number of different languages in fact in the Vietnam War was trained in Chinese to the level that he could decode their messages.
[time=1282] Not only did he learn their language he learned to break their codes.
[time=1286] And since earned his doctorate from Cambridge and had this enormous intellect and could wrap his mind around very deep and complex theological matters and present them in the classroom with clarity and inspiration and a sense of relevance.
[time=1303] I along with all the other guys in my year and years around me flocked to his classes and signed up for them but he was a professor.
[time=1311] He was somewhat intellectual and somewhat distant and somewhat removed and while we idolized him for his intellectual prowess and his ability to communicate and make difficult things clear there was a sense in our hearts where we wished we could know him better and we wished there would be some warmth and we wondered often about that.
[time=1332] Well it all changed this weekend I come through the door and there's Mark and I walk up to him out of admiration and respect and my heart's beating a little faster than normal I stick my hand out and say hi Mark.
[time=1343] And he grabs my hand and then pulls me close to his body and wraps his arm around me gives me one of these big bear hugs and then he says you know Russell I think of you often and I feel remiss for not having called you.
[time=1359] And I kind of looked at him like is this the same guy?
[time=1364] So I returned his warmth and thanked him very much and went on into the main auditorium to hear the keynote speaker and all of a sudden I look up and coming down the aisle is Mark and he comes and sits down next to me and no sooner does he sit down and he puts his arm around me and squeezes me over and says do you mind if I say something to you?
[time=1384] I'm thinking oh my goodness yeah sure say it.
[time=1389] He said you know I always really liked you but I just was never able to tell you that and in fact I don't believe I was the friend to you that I should have been.
[time=1405] At which point I felt his forehead for the fever checked his pulse I mean I was dumbfounded I was overjoyed in my heart but I was shocked at the change and the warmth.
[time=1419] We went to lunch the next day with a couple of other of his students who I had also been in school with and we had had him together and he began to tell us the path that God has had him on in the last five or six years and how he has started to view the value of relationships
[time=1433] and how he has begun to perceive how passive and how distant the American male can be and how selfish the male can be and how they can use their gift or bent in life to really distance themselves from vital relationship and caring for other people's needs
[time=1451] and being a self-sacrificial servant in other people's lives and several times during this lunch my buddies and I have our chins about hit the floor you know we couldn't believe what he was saying.
[time=1463] He went on to indicate that this happened not just with his seminary students but even in his own home and when there would be conflict in his home and things would not be right instead of being strong and caring and loving and penetrating the situation with his strength as the father and as the husband
[time=1479] and as the leader of the home he would sit in a chair and get somewhat intellectual and in that way be able to stay distant and removed and unloving and unsacrificial and he confessed that as a sin and said he's been working on it.
[time=1497] He's just a miracle. God has the ability to change us and to make us want to do things not from selfish ambition and to begin to regard one another is more important than ourselves and to begin to have the interests of others at our hearts
[time=1512] and to begin to take down some of the false barriers in our lives that keep us distant from other people and keep us a safe distance away from having to meet their needs.
[time=1525] And I don't think it's just true of intellectual seminary professors.
[time=1529] I look at our culture and I look at my own life and I hear lots of people saying well I don't meet that person's need because I don't really feel like it.
[time=1537] There's no something inside of me that draws me to that person and so I don't want to be a hypocrite and act without the proper feelings and so I don't help.
[time=1546] I hear other people say well I'd love to help that person and really minister to them but I'm just simply too busy and it's just a matter of scheduling and there's just no time in my life for that.
[time=1555] And I hear other people talk about it this way that the grid in their life is fun and whatever is fun is the primary point of decision making and if helping other people isn't fun then it doesn't occur in their life.
[time=1567] And I hear other people say they're too tired to help after a long day's work and all that's gone on when they come home they really don't expect to minister at home.
[time=1576] They expect to be ministered to because after all they worked real hard all day and we live in a very selfish society.
[time=1584] It's almost as if we came out of the idealism of the 60s where things were going to be right and people were going to love each other and there was going to be equality and all the hopes and dreams of those who were really aspiring to the ideals of the 60s gave way
[time=1596] to the disillusionment of the 70s and so the society at large kind of ran away from the disappointment in their life into drugs and sex and all the stuff that went with that and that gave way to the 80s where all of a sudden the word self and self preservation
[time=1613] and self actualization and self interest and a very selfish orientation has given away in our culture at a level and an intensity that has never been seen before in the United States of America.
[time=1625] It's my time and my strength and my desires and my hopes and my dreams and my dignity and my free time and my vacation and the motto is to look out for number one and we are a culture dominated by this notion of pursuing and defending
[time=1642] and maintaining our own personal rights and we say things like I've got it coming or I deserve a break today or I deserve this or I earned this or I paid my dues.
[time=1653] It's me, myself, mine, we are nothing but grown up, spoiled little toddlers.
[time=1664] He's only four months old, he doesn't know anything yet, he doesn't have self awareness, he sort of does, he looks at his hand but he doesn't know that this is his toy and this is his blanket and this is his room and he turned the TV on first
[time=1679] and he deserves this and he deserves that but you give him a few years, he'll grow right into it and pretty soon his whole world will revolve around himself.
[time=1690] That is the inborn sin within us, that is the pride, that is the lack of brokenness and humility and what we do as a society now in the 80s and the 90s is we enshrine that selfishness
[time=1705] and we demand it legally and when we go to get counseling our counselors tell us that until we can get ourselves straight and love ourselves and stand up for our own rights will never be healed
[time=1718] so we even lock it up inside of the counseling sessions and then we can find churches that will tell us the exact same thing
[time=1731] but I'm here to tell you today it doesn't work, selfishness and self love is not the answer, in fact it is the opposite of the answer
[time=1740] and what happens as we look at our society and we look at our own lives is when we are selfish, it leaves us feeling very alone, it leaves us feeling very empty, it leaves us feeling very manipulative because that's in fact what we are
[time=1752] and it leaves us without the ability to trust anybody else to act on our best interest, I mean we're not acting on anybody else's interest so why should they be acting in ours?
[time=1761] and so on isolated, lonely, relationally, debauched society and everybody's looking out for number one and the whole concept of community and relationship and trust and respect and investing in other people's lives is gone from our society
[time=1781] but there is another way, there is another way as frightening as it may seem and it's the way in front of us in our text this morning
[time=1790] it is the notion that you and I would not do things from selfishness or empty conceit, it's the notion that you and I would have as our first criteria the other person's interest, why? because we have to know because we are valuing them more important than we value ourselves
[time=1807] and so while we do look out for our own interests that really is only a means to a greater end so that we can stay strong and healthy and active and vital so we can continue to pursue their interests
[time=1818] you say well maybe show me an example of it, well that's what Paul is going to do and that's where I want to suspend most of our time this morning
[time=1826] I want us to look at the example that Paul gives us in verses 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 it's none other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[time=1833] see it in verse 5, have this attitude in yourselves, what attitude, the attitude he just described nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, esteeming others is more important than yourself
[time=1844] not acting in your own personal interests only but for the interests of others, have that attitude, have an others orientation, be selfless, be humble, be broken
[time=1852] be genuinely on the planet for other people's well being, have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus
[time=1859] and now these remaining verses tell us about how Jesus did that, about what it looked like in his life
[time=1866] and this is really hard because again you look at what he did and you say I can't do that
[time=1872] but we'll look at it just the same and maybe be encouraged to become a little more selfless than we are
[time=1879] maybe be encouraged to acknowledge our selfishness and repent of it and see the error of the way and pray that God would help us to chart some new uncharted territory in our life what you find in verses 6, 7, 8 are seven steps down, seven steps down for Christ
[time=1899] seven steps down into humiliation, seven steps down into selflessness and brokenness and a commitment to serve other people
[time=1908] the first one is found in verse 6, it's the starting point who, namely Christ, although he existed in the form of God, stop right there
[time=1919] before you can be humbled or before you can appreciate the degree to which someone has been humbled you got to know from where they started and Paul establishes without any shadow of a doubt that Jesus Christ existed in the form of God
[time=1931] Jesus Christ was God, he was the king of kings, Lord of lords, the creator of it all, the one who sustains it all this is the all encompassing alpha and omega, the beginning and the end, this is God of God's Lord of lords, king of kings, Jesus Christ is God he is the highest being of all existence, he never wasn't, he never will not be he always was, he is self-sustaining, he is independent, he is God John 1-1 says as much, in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and then in verse 14 and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us Jesus Christ for all eternity was God and for all eternity will be God there's never been a moment when he wasn't God he's the absolute ultimate of all that there is, Colossians 1-15 says and he is the image of the invisible God, the first born of all creation
[time=1984] he is in fact the image of the invisible God in Hebrews 1-3 and he is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his nature and upholds all things by the word of his power you want to know the point from which Christ descends the highest possible point being God the next step is found also in verse 6
[time=2010] and it says there, this is where we gain some additional insight although he existed in the form of God he did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped so equality with God was not an issue but what's important is that he didn't grasp to it the word grasp means to clutch or to seize or to hold on to something in other words he didn't hold on to his rights and privileges and honored and favored position as being God he didn't clutch to them then you look back over the annals of history and you find the men who have risen to great positions of prominence as kings of nations or in high positions of government and somebody threatens that and somebody suggests they no longer be that and what do you have you have a war on your hands Christ didn't do that Christ chose not to exploit his honored position he was willing to set it aside for someone else the third step is found in verse 7 starting out as God choosing not to grasp the equality and seek to hold on to it for himself he goes a step further he empties himself and the word but is in contrast to grasping he not only didn't grasp it and hold on to it he gave it away
[time=2086] it's a self-empting process kenosis the refusal to use what he had to his own advantage he had open hands he said here if this needs to go it can go I'll give it away I'll give the privilege I'll give the position I'll give the honor I'll give the glory I'll give the esteem of being God away now it's difficult at this point and this is where we get a little theological hang on for a second there is no point at which Jesus Christ stopped being God he was always God he always will be God he was God in the manger he was God as he walked along the seaside by Galilee he was God when they put him on a cross he was God when they put him in the grave he was God when he rose again he's God right now he's always been God he can't stop being God and anybody who tells you he stopped being God is teaching you heresy but what he did was he emptied himself he gave up prerogatives of divinity he gave up portions of what it meant for him to be God the Bible lists five let me give them to you number one his heavenly glory his heavenly glory and the glory of heaven he gave up the unbelievable glory and that he mitts from his very being by virtue of being God and it was veiled and masked in human flesh secondly he gave up the use of his independent authority Hebrews 5-8 says he learned obedience from the things which he suffered now this is an interesting concept imagine for a moment being Lord of all there is never having to check your desires or your will with anybody because you were it there was never a point of subordination there was never a point of submitting there was never a point of anybody else ever leading you there was never a point of you being under anybody ever and in order for you to meet our needs you submit and you learn obedience a word that is never used in relationship to a sovereign God John 5-30 I do not seek my own will but the will of him who sent me we see him in the garden of Gethsemane crying out oh God if there's any way for this cup to pass from me but not my will this is God speaking not my will your will he says to his heavenly father so he gives up his heavenly glory he gives up the use of independent authority and he gives up thirdly the full use of his omniscience to be God means you know everything all the time about everybody and everything to be God means you never don't know anything it means there's never a question that can be raised never the deepest most profound question cannot even be articulated but you know the question before it said not to mention the answer and all the answers that relate to that answer to be God means you know everything but in Matthew 24-36 when asked by a couple of people what in the world are the events that culminate the end of the age when is the son of man coming Jesus said but the day and the hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven nor the son but the father alone and so men of humiliation of having to stand before mere humans and say I don't know I don't know that's inconceivable for God to say that second Corinthians eight nine lists a fourth one says that Christ though he was rich yet for your sake he became poor that you through his poverty might become rich here is the God that owns everything here is the God with unfathomable riches riches that we can't even begin to understand not just worldly witches but spiritual riches and all that goes with that in domains and regions we can't conceive of and he gave them up he was fabulously wealthy and became poor for us in order that he might seek our best interest and the fifth one that talks about his being emptied in second Corinthians 5 21 and this is unbelievable it says there he who knew no sin became sin on our behalf he lost his purity he gave up his separate kindness from sin which to God is the ultimate he's holy he's transcendent he's separate from anything that has anything to do with sin and yet for your behalf and my behalf in the humbling process of walking down to the place of a servant he lost his purity and became sin
[time=2343] it's difficult to find analogies for these and so we'll try with this one the women that I have talked to who have been raped have a rage in their heart that their purity has been taken from them and they are now violated and in a sense they feel dirty by what has been done to them Christ voluntarily gave it up and took on the sins of the world and became sin wasn't just attached to his name he became it so there is this process of moving downward from absolute heavenly glory giving up the use of his independent authority giving up the perfect knowledge that he had giving up his personal wealth and giving up his purity you know he keeps walking downward back to our text you see there in verse six existing in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped emptied himself and now number four taking the form of a bond servant he goes from king to slave now folks this is not a masquerade this is not him putting on some show this is not putting on a costume what this is saying is that Christ actually became a slave a doulas Luke 22 27 I am among you as one who serves Matthew 2028 says he didn't come to be served but to serve and as a true servant he owned nothing he didn't have any possessions because slaves don't own things and so everything he used he borrowed he had to borrow a place to be born he had to borrow a place to sleep as you read the New Testament you'll find him often in the evening retiring to the Mount of Olives because he didn't have a place to sleep he didn't have an apartment he didn't have a house so he slept in the mountains like some vagrant like some homeless person he had to borrow a boat to cross the Sea of Galilee he had to borrow a boat to preach in he had to borrow a donkey for his triumphal entry he had to borrow a room for the Passover he even had to be laid in a borrowed tomb do you borrow many things do you know what it feels like to go over to somebody's house and say well maybe it's a rake okay but you know you're talking about that tension that goes on inside your life where you borrow things from people it's a weak position it's a position of being needy and you don't like doing it what we like to do as Americans is to buy our own things so we don't have to borrow it he borrowed everything he had nothing because he was truly a slave and a doula he was possessionless slaves carry burdens Isaiah 53 6 says he carried the greatest burden of all time your sin and my sin and so as a slave he serves by carrying the burdens of the sins of the world well he takes another step down in verse 7 you'll notice it says he was born or being made the in verse 7 being made in the likeness of men what does that mean total identification total identification he was made in the likeness of man and I want you to realize he was not made in the likeness of the pre-fall man the perfect man Adam that was created before the fall when he came he didn't take pre-fall Adam he took fallen human you say how do you know that well because look at his body it suffered pain it suffered sorrow it wept it cried it had tears it knew hunger it knew thirst it became weary it became weak and it eventually what died pre-fall man doesn't do that only post fall man he took on full humanity in every regard with the exception of sin Hebrews 4 15 says he was in all points tested yet without sin but he didn't come and take Adam's perfect body which would have been free of all the things we just listed he took your body and my body and thereby knew the pain and the sorrow and the weeping and the tears and the hunger and the thirst and the weariness and the weakness and the death that you and I know so he came in total identification with those he sought to serve and then it says this look at verse 8 the sixth step down says that he was being found in appearance as a man you say what does that mean he already said he was in the likeness of men how does that differ from being found in appearance as a man I believe the indication here is that he not only took the likeness of a man but when he was found when he was discovered when he was looked upon when he was viewed by his fellow man that's all they saw was a man it's one thing for God to become man it's another thing for man to only recognize him as man you say didn't they ever know he was God no well what about his works what about his miracles what about his preaching didn't that reveal his glory yes to a degree and what do they do with it in Matthew chapter 12 when he had finally proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he was superhuman that he was God they said this man is not of God this man is of Satan they didn't attribute his divine attributes to the fact that he was God in human flesh they just said he's getting this extra stuff from Satan never been somewhere where nobody knows you never been somewhere where nobody knows who you are your wife your kids your job your house aren't you just dying to tell them aren't you just dying to establish your identity with them how do we introduce people this is so and so from such and such he's vice president of such and such I mean we're all into that Jesus Christ came took on the likeness of fallen man saved sin itself and then walked around the earth and nobody ever worshiped him as the god he was so this royal majestic king of the universe and they don't even know it does he fight back does he demand they fall before him no look what he does verse 8 being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death even death on a cross went through a series of mock trials by a bunch of political leaders who were only trying to establish their own or maintain their own position of power they were wicked men they didn't care about justice they didn't care about the truth and in those trials he was spit on and slapped and mocked the whole while he knew he was on his way to his death the whole while he knew he could have snapped his fingers and stopped the whole process and annihilated everybody in his process but because of your best interest and my best interest he continued to walk down this path of absolute abject humiliation to the point of death on a cross the Persians invented it the Romans perfected it it was a devastating form of capital punishment probably the most severe and shameful in all of humanity accompanied by great pain and shame and nakedness and disgrace being lifted up in the public place tell you die
[time=2768] and people watch you agonize with the death process until finally it's over
[time=2774] you say how humble should I be you say how much of my right should I give away you say what do you mean when you say I shouldn't act in my own best interest or my own selfishness or empty conceit
[time=2788] what do you mean I should esteem one another as more important than myself do you have an example of this can you put shoe leather to it yes it's right there the person of Jesus Christ that's why when you study this passage at least if you're like me you back up and you say I don't understand it's too much for me it's too much I can't even treat the people I love this way much less the people who accuse me and insult me and hurt me much less the people I don't even know I was struggling for an analogy and again I hope you'll forgive me if this is falling far short of it but the analogy came to my mind would be that of a plantation owner just before the civil war
[time=2834] a man of great wealth a man of great privilege a man who was greatly honored in his society a man who would have owned many slaves and out of this text might have come a heart to say I need to free the slaves I need to treat them as more important than myself I need to to act in their best interest and this is obviously hypothetical because a person doing this wouldn't change anything as it did in the case of Christ but just imagine with me for a minute if he didn't grasp his ownership of the plantation if he didn't clutch it to himself and defend it against others what if he opened his hands and gave it away in fact gave it to the slaves themselves and then became like a slave actually became one of them was owned by the plantation itself became a slave and then in the likeness of men became black like the slaves were black so he could fully identify with their plight and then as an appearance of a man when he was viewed by people
[time=2906] he was not viewed as a former plantation owner who had sacrificed it all and become a slave a black slave all they saw when they met this man was a black slave they had no knowledge of who he was and what he had done absolutely totally humbled by the whole process
[time=2924] and then found that the only way he could help them was to offer them himself and so they themselves took him and crucified him
[time=2934] it's unbelievable what Christ has done for us
[time=2942] but I have good news the story does not end here look at verses 9, 10 and 11 therefore also God highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father what we're seeing here is a principle of truth that the Word of God reveals over and over and over again it's this whoever exalts himself shall be humbled and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted God had it in his heart to lift Jesus Christ up out of the grave in the resurrection and then to through the ascension bring him back into heaven and there crown him again as king of kings and Lord of lords and grant to him a new name a name which is above every other name the name of Lord and there is coming a day when every knee the knees of those who believe in him and the knees of those who curse him will bow before him and acknowledge him for who he is and worship him for who he is Luke 14, 11, for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled and he who humbles himself shall be exalted James 4, 10 humble yourself in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you first Peter 5, 6 humble yourselves therefore into the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you at the proper time and you say oh I understand now now I see how Christ could do this now I understand why he would be willing to walk down this path to a place of abject poverty and death as a slave rejected by the people he came to save now because he knew that after it was over God would exalt him in heaven you're right everything is true of you and me that's the whole point isn't that it aren't we supposed to be willing to walk down the steps of humiliation in our life and to consider other his interest as more important than our own and to refuse to act from selfish ambition and to let God do anything he wants in our lives to give up all of our stuff in our rights if God would have that of us and serve people of the same truth God is going to be pleased to raise us from the dead and through the resurrection we will ascend into heaven and there we too will be what crowned and sit there on the throne with Christ and rule with him and have forever the presence of Christ as our satisfaction of our hearts see what was true of him is true of us he gave it all up and God gave it all back and God wants us to give it all up because he's going to give it all back and far more than we ever lost Christ descended from all that stuff in the first place and only got it back you and I this is all we've known and this is all we are we don't deserve any of this stuff I think that's what the passage is trying to say to us I really believe that is what the Word of God is asking us to do and to be and I just want to confess as a fellow struggle with you this morning that it scares me and I look at my life and I look at my selfishness and I look at the way that I manipulate and I'm a long way but I really believe that is what Christ is calling us to to try with all of our hearts I don't think it's calling us to sell of our positions and to give up whatever course God may have us on I don't think that you can't push it out to an external extreme of what you own and those kinds of things it's talking about an attitude in our heart that as we are going through the life which God has given us to genuinely be seeking the interest of others because we esteem them more highly than ourselves I think that works out differently in everybody's lives I think that's why we have the Holy Spirit to help us know what that looks like I do believe with all my heart however but that is the path to joy not just in heaven but here I believe that this is the book of joy this is the book about joy and I believe if you and I want to know the joy that God would have for us we will live like Christ here and now and there will be great sacrifice but underneath it somewhere there is this residing joy and I'll say one last thing as I close I know little of this but I believe that as you walk in this way and you try to live for other people's best interests you are walking in the same footsteps as Christ walked and you have the same mindset as he had and you have the same priorities as he had and as a result I think you feel the sense of his presence in your life in ways you don't otherwise feel that when you are walking in the selfish ambition of your own heart and you're manipulating people and you're grasping and you're striving and you're defending and you're holding on to things while you're still saying I believe there's a relational distance that comes between you and Christ on a practical level and as when you convene with his path that you feel more of his presence in your life because you're doing what he did and there's a little rotary in a fellowship and I believe that's worth the world well let's pray together Father you bring us to passages such as these and they strip past the facade of our lives they open up our hearts and expose what we are and you know that we don't want to be this way you know we struggle with our own sinfulness you know that because of what you've done in our life through the grace of God you've given us new hopes and new dreams for the kingdom yet we are found wanting and we are thankful that we can ask for help we are thankful that you have not finished with us as it says in Philippians 1 6 the work which you've begun you will be faithful to complete and we know that this is bigger than our own effort that you are going to undergird us and walk with us and help us along and forgive us for our sin and our selfishness but it causes us to see Christ in contrast to our own sin and we see this magnificent prince who having it all
[time=3362] not for people of any repute but for sinners for people who he knew would reject him knew who would crucify him and we throw ourselves in there with those crying for his crucifixion and we just worship Christ we just lift him up and exalt him and say that he is everything we could ever want or hope to be and we are thankful for his death and his resurrection and he makes up for our sinfulness that the finished work of the cross makes it possible for us at one time to receive an exaltation in a place in heaven that we would never deserve and we ask for the help and the strength to try to live more for you and more for others than we do today thank you for the hope and the help in Christ Amen
