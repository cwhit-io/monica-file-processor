[time=0] You see, Christian growth is 100% you and it's 100% God.
[time=30] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=41] Thank you for joining us. What is the secret to spiritual growth?
[time=45] How do we break free from the sins which so easily entangle us?
[time=50] Is it a matter of personal determination, sacrifice and commitment?
[time=54] Do we just redouble our effort and try, try again or is it a matter of letting go and letting God produce the growth?
[time=62] Do we simply need to walk in the spirit and not carry out the desires of the flesh?
[time=67] Well today we find the answer to this vital and long debated question in our study of Philippians 2, 12 and 13.
[time=74] Our special music today will be provided by Brian Losen
[time=81] and from Cedarville College the Cedarville Chamber Orchestra.
[time=85] Let's join our sanctuary choir and combined orchestras as they begin our service.
[time=111] Thanks to thee, O Lord of all the people, I will sing praises to thee among the nations
[time=127] For the same that's on this page is free to the heavens, where I beg for others, where I beg for others, where I beg for others.
[time=146] We are so tender, oh Lord, I love my hands, oh Lord of all the hands, oh Lord of all the earth, we are so tender, oh Lord of all the earth.
[time=172] We are so tender, oh Lord of all the earth, we are so tender, oh Lord of all the earth.
[time=186] I will live God my holy sin pray to my salvation, I will bless thy holy name O Lord of all my King.
[time=206] And my verse is never end, and I think of it as forever.
[time=215] Now I'm worthy to busy glory, and honor ever.
[time=225] Oh Lord of all the earth, oh Lord of all the earth, oh Lord of all the earth, oh Lord of all the earth.
[time=246] Let thy glory, oh Lord of all the earth, we are so tender, oh Lord of all the hands, oh Lord of all the earth.
[time=319] [APPLAUSE]
[time=327] [MUSIC]
[time=348] Oh what a time will be, when we see loved ones there, those who have gone before, eternal joys to share.
[time=373] And oh what a song, when the blood was strong, start singing a song, the angels cannot sing.
[time=393] Oh what a moment, when we see Jesus, when we stand face to face in His embrace, and thank Him for a man's embrace.
[time=418] Oh what a moment, when we see Him.
[time=440] Harvest will then be passed, we'll no longer gather, only what's done for Christ is all that will matter.
[time=464] The seeds we have sold will then be made known, what joy shall fill our raptured souls, that may.
[time=488] Oh what a moment, when we see Jesus, when we stand face to face in His embrace, and thank Him for a man's embrace.
[time=512] Oh what a moment, when we see Him.
[time=552] [APPLAUSE]

[time=672] We have the men who erect the set working on that and presenting new parts of the set, building it, and there are seamstresses that are already at work.
[time=682] I met yesterday with the drama people so it's going to be a great day. I hope you get tickets for the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=689] We're going back now to the live portion of our service with some more music and then the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=702] [MUSIC - 293 seconds]
[time=1008] Let's take a minute and pray for Cedarville and for these young people. Father, we're thankful for, again, the wonderful morning of music we enjoy here. We're thankful for the talent and for the gifts that you've given to our own local body, as led by Peter Coby.
[time=1024] But we're also thankful for these visiting musicians, young people who love Christ and who are preparing to serve him at a place like Cedarville. We ask your blessing on Paul Dixon and on the many students from our own church here that attend Cedarville and are being trained in various disciplines for the cause of Christ. And Lord, we're just thankful for institutions like that.
[time=1046] And now as we direct our thoughts and our hearts towards the Word of God and towards what you would say to us, we pray that we would have teachable hearts and open minds that the Spirit of God would penetrate and lead us into the knowledge of the truth. We pray these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=1064] Well, let me invite you to take your Bible and come to Philippians chapter 2.
[time=1071] We'll continue our study of this book, and I want to involve you in the beginning of this study by asking you a question or drawing a bit of a scenario and asking you to formulate an answer.
[time=1082] The scenario is this. You're at a local restaurant here in town. You've got an hour or two to kill, and you're with a very good friend.
[time=1089] Someone you know to be a Christian, somebody that you have talked about spiritual things before in the past. It's not just an acquaintance. It's a close friend.
[time=1097] There's a cup of coffee and some spare time. Your friend says to you, "I'm struggling with a particular area in my life. I just can't seem to gain the victory in it."
[time=1108] And I deliberated in my own mind what kind of a problem this friend would present to you, whether it be a drinking problem or a problem with a spouse or a child or maybe a problem with eating and exercising, just feeling kind of out of control, but I've landed on this one, their prayer life.
[time=1124] They say to you, "I am really struggling with my prayer life." It's not that I don't know how to pray. I've studied that. I understand what the Word of God says about prayer, when to pray, how to pray, why to pray.
[time=1135] I've even had some success with prayer in my life at certain times and days gone by, but in the last six or seven months, I've just been failing miserably. I don't have a heart to pray.
[time=1146] I don't seem to get around to it, and I feel the conviction of the Spirit of God in my life. I'm in sin, and I just can't get any victory in this particular area.
[time=1158] What are you going to say? They're your friend. They're asking for your help. How are you going to counsel your friend?
[time=1166] It doesn't have to be prayer. It could be some other issue that maybe your friend did ask you about this week, or that you asked your friend about for your own help.
[time=1175] What is the secret to spiritual victory and growth and obedience in the Christian life?
[time=1182] Some of you might have been inclined to phrase it this way. Well, it's really a matter of spiritual duty.
[time=1188] It's a matter of your own personal commitment. There needs to be a refocusing of your priorities. You need to get excited about it again.
[time=1195] You might want to draw us to 1 Timothy 4, where it says that physical, disciplined, prophetess, little, but spiritual godliness avails in all areas of life.
[time=1206] You might draw the comparison. You spend 30, 40 minutes getting ready to go to work, just to be in public on your body.
[time=1214] The least you could do is spend that much time in prayer for the cause of Christ, studying the Word of God.
[time=1219] You might want to draw me to James, if I were your friend, and say, you know, you can't just be a hearer of the Word who looks in the mirror and sees the problem and then goes away.
[time=1228] You've got to be a doer of the Word, or Romans 12. I ought to be a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable. I've got to get myself back up on the altar.
[time=1236] I've got to sacrifice my life. It's duty. It's commitment. It's priorities. It's the energy. It's making a decision to live differently.
[time=1246] Others of you might have answered the question completely differently. You might have said, you know, you're probably trying too hard.
[time=1254] In fact, it's probably the fact that you're trying so hard, and you think the answer lies within yourself. That may be your problem.
[time=1261] In fact, it may be that you're working this out on your own, is preventing the power of the Spirit of God in your life, and you need to kind of fall back into the grace of God and trust His power to work in and through you.
[time=1274] And you might draw me to Galatians 5, which says, if I'll walk by the Spirit, I'll not carry out the desires of the flesh.
[time=1280] You'd want to remind me that it's the power of the Spirit of God inside of me that transforms my life, and in fact my trying may be precluding His ability to work.
[time=1293] Who's right? Is it the commitment group? Is it the spiritual duty group? Is it the spiritual sacrifice group? Or is it the let go and let God group?
[time=1305] Well, what is the answer? Well, your passage this morning has the answer. It's Philippians chapter 2. We're going to study verses 12 and 13 this morning.
[time=1317] Begin in verse 12. So then my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence.
[time=1326] The obvious issue here is obedience and growth in your Christian life, and it's that Paul is no longer with them, he's in prison, and he says your growth isn't dependent upon my being with you.
[time=1335] And even now in my absence you can grow. How? Well, look at the end of verse 12. Work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
[time=1346] Sounds like he's a part of the commitment group, doesn't it? Sounds like he's a part of the spiritual duty. You've got to get yourself fired up inside and get back on track and reprioritize and recommit and redouble your efforts and get this issue resolved in your life.
[time=1361] Then look at verse 13. He says, "For it is God. Who is at work in you? Both to will and to work his good pleasure."
[time=1371] Now he sounds like he's on the let go and let God group. It's not so much a matter of what you're going to do, it's what God is going to do.
[time=1378] In fact, God is at work inside of you to produce a will and a life full of good works that please him. You say, which one is it?
[time=1388] I mean, is it me or is it God? The answer is yes. Your Christian life is the product of your commitment and your sacrifice and your hard work and your diligence.
[time=1402] It takes all of you to live your Christian life and you have to be 100% called and committed to the task. Verse 12. Verse 13, it's all of God.
[time=1412] God is the one who is at work. God's power will produce the fruit. God's power will cause the growth. It's all of God.
[time=1419] You see, Christian growth is 100% you and it's 100% God.
[time=1424] Now just so you don't think I'm talking about some isolated thought, maybe misinterpreting these two verses, maybe imposing my own understanding upon them, I invite you to come with me to a couple of different texts this morning that teach the same thing. Come to 2 Peter chapter 1.
[time=1440] 2 Peter chapter 1 verse 3, and we'll see the same tension in these verses as well. It says in 2 Peter 1 3, seeing that his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness through the true knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and excellence.
[time=1463] Where did we get everything pertaining to life and godliness? We got it through his power. It's his divine power that gave us what we have and made us what we are and brought us into the kingdom and will grant us growth in our Christian life.
[time=1478] But look at the other side, look at verse 5. Now for this very reason, because he's done all that, here's what we got to do, apply all diligence. That's another word for hard work.
[time=1489] In your faith, supply moral excellence, and in your moral excellence knowledge, and in your knowledge, self-control, and in your self-control perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness, and in your godliness, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly kindness, the epitome of all the virtues of Christianity, love, agape, self-sacrifice, give yourself away.
[time=1512] So the same tension. I have been granted everything pertaining to life and godliness through his power. At the same time I am called to add to what he has given me, my diligence, my moral excellence, knowledge, self-control, perseverance, godliness, brotherly kindness, and love.
[time=1530] Come back a few books to Colossians, Colossians chapter 1. You'll see the same tension. This time, as it is applied to Paul himself, he's laboring here for the maturity and the growth of the saints at Colossae.
[time=1548] He says in verse 28, Colossians 1.28, and we proclaim him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom that we may present every man complete in Christ, and for this purpose I also labor and strive.
[time=1565] He says, you're going to grow because I'm admonishing, I'm proclaiming, I'm teaching with all wisdom, and I'm doing that to the point of labor, which means to break a sweat and I'm striving at it.
[time=1577] That's one side, isn't it? Look at the other.
[time=1581] Verse 29, and for this purpose I also labor and strive according to his power, which mightily works within me.
[time=1591] So it's my effort, it's my labor, it's my admonishing, it's my teaching, it's my striving, but it's all according to his power that works inside of me.
[time=1601] You sound confused. Well, hang on, it gets worse. Come to 1 Corinthians 15.
[time=1608] So far we've had to look at a couple verses to find the tension.
[time=1612] Now I'll show it to you in the same verse. 1 Corinthians 15 verse 10.
[time=1623] He says here, but by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me did not prove vain, but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God within me.
[time=1640] What's he saying? He's saying anything I am, anything that I've accomplished, any growth that's occurred in my Christian life, any point of maturity I've attained in my Christian life, I am that by the grace of God.
[time=1652] And his grace toward me did not prove vain. In other words, the impact of the grace of God was to affect in my life, that's why I can say what I am, I am by the grace of God.
[time=1663] But then he says, I labored even more than all of them.
[time=1668] As far as I know, any Christian I know of, I've worked harder than anybody I know in the process of growing and maturing and striving and laboring to grow and acknowledge in the grace of Christ.
[time=1681] But he finishes not I, the grace of God within me. You say this guy's schizophrenic. He can't figure out what's going on inside of him.
[time=1690] Well maybe he does know in reality. Come to Galatians chapter 2 verse 20, I'll show you just one more verse.
[time=1697] Galatians 2 verse 20, he says this, Galatians 2 verse 20, many of you have this verse memorized, he says there, I have been crucified with Christ.
[time=1714] And it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. You want to know why I'm an apostle to the Gentiles, you want to know why I preach, you want to know why I pray, you want to know why I get thrown in prison and beaten up
[time=1726] and shipwrecks and all the rest that occurs in my life, you want to know the force behind all that that keeps me on pace, that keeps me moving and growing and serving.
[time=1734] Well I'll tell you what it is. It's not me because I'm dead. I've been crucified. I no longer live. It's Christ who lives in me.
[time=1742] You go good. Thanks for solving that problem.
[time=1745] Then he says, and the life which I now live, oh thanks, so it's back to him again, the life which I now live, I live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, the life that I'm living, I'm living by faith.
[time=1763] So I hope that puts your mind at ease and you can come back now to Philippians 2 if you would. Philippians 2 verses 12 and 13, that this is not some isolated principle. This doesn't just happen once in the New Testament.
[time=1775] I won't take you there today. I could. 1 Kings 8, you might read that, verses 54 to 61, you'll see the same principle in the Old Testament. 1 Kings 8, 54 to 61.
[time=1790] You say, who is it? Is it God or is it me? And the New Testament answers, yes, it's both of you.
[time=1797] And in fact, you must maintain those two things in a dynamic tension against each other, or you will fall into great air.
[time=1806] It is only as you understand that your Christian growth is all of you, and at the same time your Christian growth is all of God, and as you hold those in a perfect dynamic tension, one against the other that you will have what we call balance, which is essential for your growth.
[time=1819] If you major on one side or the other, you get an imbalance in all kinds of errors developed. For example, if you major on the commitment side and you say it's all spiritual duty and it's all me and it's all my effort and it's all my striving, it's my laboring, then if you are in fact victorious in your particular struggle, who gets the credit?
[time=1838] If you lose those 30 pounds, who gets the credit? Well, you do. It was your effort. It was your striving. It was your refocusing. It was your reprioritizing.
[time=1849] And by the way, folks, that happens to lead to something called pride, and pride leads to something called a judgmental spirit against other Christians who aren't doing so well right now.
[time=1859] That leads to this unity in the church. That tears the whole thing down. If you major just on the commitment side.
[time=1865] The other danger over here on commitment side is when you've tried your hardest and you've read all the books you can read and you've memorized all the verses you can memorize and you've got all the accountability anybody could ever get and you've redetermined
[time=1876] and rewritten your purposes and you've said, I am going to live successfully in this area and then you fail.
[time=1884] Where else do you turn? You said it all depended on you. You gave it all you had and you failed. Where do we go from here? It's called hopelessness and despair.
[time=1893] And these kinds of Christians find their way out the doors of the church and back into the community and they kind of just drift away because they've reached the end of their rope.
[time=1900] They've done everything they can. They can't make it. They can't cut the mustard and they just give up.
[time=1908] Two remarkable dangers, pride and hopelessness if you say it is all dependent upon the individual.
[time=1915] If on the other hand you say it's all let go and let God. In fact, this happened to me early in my Christian experience.
[time=1921] One of my sisters came up to me with a neat little book about how to be spirit filled, how to be under the control of the spirit.
[time=1927] And it was all about what they called spiritual breathing and it was the key. It was the answer. It was the fundamental principle to Christian growth and maturity.
[time=1935] It went this way. When you sin you've got to exhale spiritual breathing and exhaling means you confess your sin and you get rid and confess and honestly openly acknowledge your sin before God.
[time=1944] And then you inhale the spirit and he takes control of your life. And the key is to submit. The key is to be passive.
[time=1952] The key is to allow the spirit to be in control of your life.
[time=1956] Well, there are some dangers with that one. What happens when you exhale your sin and you inhale the spirit and you mean in all your heart, be in control of my life and then you sin?
[time=1967] Well, whose fault is it? It's like something's gone haywire with the Holy Spirit. He's not enough. He's not strong enough.
[time=1973] Or something went wrong with me. Maybe I didn't exhale enough or inhale enough.
[time=1977] And maybe I need to do it some more. Maybe I need to give myself more to the Spirit of God, which eventually brings you right back over to commitment.
[time=1986] So an emphasis on either side and over emphasis. As soon as you let go of the tension, as soon as you let go of the balance, you're in trouble.
[time=1994] It's both. It's all of both. It's all of you and it's all of God.
[time=1998] Except doesn't make sense. Well, there's a lot of things in the Bible that are just like that.
[time=2003] God teaches the truth and we accept it because He said it.
[time=2007] It's all of you and it's all of God.
[time=2010] With that as a foundation, let's take a closer look at these two verses.
[time=2014] Let's take a look at the first side, the commitment side in verse 12.
[time=2018] It says there at the end of the verse, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."
[time=2025] Notice, He does not say, "Work for your salvation." He doesn't say, "Work at your salvation." He doesn't say, "Work up your salvation."
[time=2036] The Christian message is anything but getting saved by works. It's that we are saved by the grace of God.
[time=2041] So you don't work for it and you don't work at it and you don't work it up.
[time=2045] It's not a product of your effort. Getting saved is totally the grace of God.
[time=2049] Make no mistake about it.
[time=2051] He is writing here to believers. He calls them saints in chapter 1, verse 1.
[time=2056] He calls them brethren in verse 12. He calls them beloved in chapter 2, verse 12.
[time=2061] The very verse we're studying. These are terms descriptive of believers.
[time=2064] He's not saying, "Get saved through hard work." He's saying, "Now that you are saved, work hard at working it out."
[time=2072] The word means to bring something to fulfillment, to completion.
[time=2075] It was used in the classical language of people who would work in the minds, the Roman minds.
[time=2082] And this is a real good picture for understanding.
[time=2085] There is an mountain somewhere deep inside, great riches, gold.
[time=2091] It's there. It's a deposit that's been placed there, we believe, by the Creator God.
[time=2097] To work it out means to extract its riches.
[time=2101] It means to fight your way through the layers of rock and go down deep into the mountain until you finally grab a hold
[time=2107] and draw it out with the sweat of your brow.
[time=2111] When you and I are called to work out our salvation with fear and trembling, what he is saying is, as we have seen,
[time=2117] God has given us everything pertaining to life and godliness, 2 Peter 1.
[time=2122] Ephesians 1, "We have been blessed with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places.
[time=2127] He has given us everything. He has made a great spiritual deposit inside of us at the point of salvation.
[time=2132] It is our responsibility to extract it, to apply it, to appropriate it, to live it,
[time=2139] and to be involved in back-breaking activity, if you will, in the process, to apply ourselves completely and totally to the process, much like a musician.
[time=2149] A musician, a very, very gifted musician.
[time=2152] When I was at the Masters College, I had the pleasure of meeting one of the students named Jill, Jill Crumpton, and she had been given by God this enormous musical ability when she was six.
[time=2163] She found out that she no longer needed the notes to play whatever she heard on the piano.
[time=2168] All she needed to do was hear it, and she could play it.
[time=2171] Within three months of taking lessons, she surpassed her older sister, eight-year-old sister, who had been taking for two years and was very good, in three months, gone, just off the chart.
[time=2183] What I found so interesting was that the professor of music at the Masters College expected more hard work of her,
[time=2190] expected more diligence, more labor, more striving, more commitment, higher priorities to her music because of her gifts.
[time=2200] She was to be working out the giftedness that God had placed in.
[time=2205] Same thing in the spiritual realm.
[time=2207] God has placed these enormous spiritual treasures inside of us, and our life is to be a dedicated, arduous effort of working those things out.
[time=2217] Paul, instead of using the example of a musician, which came to my mind, he uses the example of an athlete.
[time=2224] Let me read you these verses.
[time=2226] Do you not know that those who run in a race all run?
[time=2230] Everybody's running. The point isn't to run.
[time=2232] Only one of them receives the prize, run in such a way that you may win.
[time=2237] And everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things.
[time=2242] They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable wreath.
[time=2247] Therefore, he says, "I run in such a way as not without aim, and I box in such a way as not beating the air. I buffet my body and make it my slave."
[time=2257] He sees his life, his Christian experience, his working out his salvation with fear and trembling, comparable to a great Olympic athlete.
[time=2265] It's not enough to be at the Olympics. It's not enough to run in a race.
[time=2269] There's got to be a level of dedication to win the race, and to do that, to exercise self-control to the extent of beating his body, bringing it into subjection.
[time=2281] First Timothy, let me read you these verses.
[time=2285] Speaking Paul now to his disciple, telling him the kind of effort it takes to live the Christian life.
[time=2290] First Timothy 4.15 says, "Take pains with these things.
[time=2293] Be absorbed in them so that your progress may be evident to all." He is banking so much upon Timothy's effort and energy and commitment and priorities that he describes it in terms of taking pains and being absolutely absorbed in them.
[time=2308] It's the only thing he can think about. It's the only thing he concentrates on.
[time=2311] It's the only thing he cares about. He's absorbed with his progress.
[time=2316] The next verse for 16, "Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching persevere.
[time=2321] Go after it. Get it. Work hard. Sacrifice."
[time=2327] In the same book, chapter 6 verse 12 he says, "Fight the good fight." Now he switches from the Olympiad over to the soldier in military duty and says, "Fight. Fight for your life.
[time=2337] Fight as if everything you stand for and your country stands for is on the line to win the fight." It's up to you. Be diligent.
[time=2347] So there's no question that the Word of God calls us to make heroic sacrifices in our life,
[time=2353] to stand for the truth of the Word of God, and to see it lived out in our lives.
[time=2359] Back in Philippians 2 I find it interesting.
[time=2362] He says, "Work out your salvation with fear and tripling fear of the Greek word phobos from which we get our word phobia and trembling traumas from which we get our word trauma."
[time=2374] So he's saying, "Work out your salvation with phobias and traumas." That's pretty committed. Work out your salvation with phobias and traumas.
[time=2384] A person who has a phobia loses touch with everything else and focuses on just this one thing.
[time=2390] A person who's traumatized is somebody who's been overwhelmed by a situation to where they can't think about everything.
[time=2396] They just think about the one thing that traumatizes them and they're shaking over it.
[time=2400] Let it be the consuming passion of your life to work out what God has worked in.
[time=2407] Fear and trembling before God, you say, "I know we're supposed to fear God, Abba Father.
[time=2411] I thought he was our Heavenly Father. He is." But he is also a holy and righteous God, and there is a healthy sense of anxiety to offend him and to suffer the consequences of violating his spiritual laws that he has set up,
[time=2425] to bringing reproach upon the name of Christ or the Church of Christ.
[time=2428] And so there is fear and trembling to live circumspectly and obediently to work out with great diligence to salvation,
[time=2435] which God has built in.
[time=2439] So whether it's alcohol or a problem with your wife or your husband or with a child or with lust or with your weight
[time=2445] or with your prayer life, work it out, work it out, run in such a way to win,
[time=2454] exercise self-control, buffet your body, take pains and be absorbed with your progress, pay close attention to yourself and fight, fight and gain the victory.
[time=2466] What's the other side? Look at verse 13. This, by the way, is my favorite side.
[time=2471] It's the fact that God is at work in me and you, both to will and to work for his own good pleasure.
[time=2478] Notice it's not God is working on you, it's not God working for you,
[time=2486] it's not God working around you, it's God working in you.
[time=2491] We stand alone friends of all the religions on the face of the earth who have a God who not only dies for us,
[time=2498] but then takes residence inside of us.
[time=2503] To work out and to assist and to empower our doing his good pleasure, and it's all of God.
[time=2510] John 16 says this, apart from the Holy Spirit, you and I would never even come to the knowledge that we were sinners
[time=2518] and had violated the holiness of God. That is the peculiar ministry of the Spirit of God.
[time=2523] And unless he convicts you of your sin, you can't even cry out for a savior, because you don't know you need one.
[time=2531] The Bible goes on to say, in Titus 3, that it's the Spirit of God and the power of the Spirit of God that regenerates us,
[time=2538] that makes us born again, that makes us new creatures in Christ, that begins to set the appetite and the longings of our heart towards God.
[time=2546] That's his work, that's his Holy Spirit in us that regenerates us.
[time=2550] We don't regenerate ourselves, we can't do anything of the sort.
[time=2555] Secondly, in 1 Corinthians 6 or 3, it says that the Spirit of God indwells us.
[time=2560] He takes up residence, makes us the temple of God.
[time=2563] He later goes on to baptize us in 1 Corinthians 12 into the body of Christ.
[time=2568] And then he seals us, Ephesians 1, that's talking about how this whole thing ends up when we go to heaven.
[time=2574] We're sealed at the point of salvation and it's his protective seal over us that keeps us safe until we get to heaven.
[time=2581] Do you realize it's the Holy Spirit who first shows us we're sinners, then regenerates us, then indwells us,
[time=2589] then baptizes us and seals us safe all the way to heaven?
[time=2593] Whose work is this, folks? It's not your work, it's his work.
[time=2597] Your salvation is the product of the work of God.
[time=2601] Turn back a page, Philippians 1, 6. This is my life text.
[time=2606] This is the one that I have on my wall because I love this notion that it's God at work in me.
[time=2614] It's bigger than me, it's bigger than my effort.
[time=2616] It's God doing this great thing in my life.
[time=2620] For I am confident of this very thing Paul says to the Philippians that he, namely God who began a good work in you, will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=2630] There's a beginning point and there's an ending point here.
[time=2633] God began your salvation and God will perfect your salvation. That means up in heaven.
[time=2638] The whole process from beginning to end is his process.
[time=2642] You enter into the power of his grace and he moves you inexorably, even though you fight and kick against it, towards perfection in the glories of heaven.
[time=2654] In John 15, try this analogy on, in verse 4 he says this, "Abide in me, says Jesus, and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[time=2664] unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in me." Envision a vine and then a branch coming off the vine.
[time=2672] You're the branch, break the branch off the vine and hold it over here and say okay, produce fruit.
[time=2677] Let's see it, grow, be obedient, mature, bring people to Christ,
[time=2683] disciple people, love your spouse, care for your children, overcome your addictive behavior.
[time=2688] What happens? This thing just dies. There's no life.
[time=2693] It has no power whatsoever to do anything apart from where, unless it's connected to the vine, through which comes the life-giving juices that make everything happen. You and I are a branch, unless we are connected to the person of Christ.
[time=2708] Nothing, absolutely nothing happens. We just shrivel and die. It's all of God.
[time=2718] That's why in 2 Corinthians 3.5 Paul says this, not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming from ourselves,
[time=2728] but our adequacy is from God.
[time=2732] If we're adequate for anything, it's not coming from us.
[time=2736] It's coming completely from God. Colossians 1.27 says Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[time=2743] You want to know what hope you have of getting to glory, getting to heaven.
[time=2746] It's not your effort. It's not your confession of sin. It's not your faith.
[time=2750] It's nothing about you. It is that Christ has come into you and He moves you to glory.
[time=2757] Yes, it takes a confession of faith to have Him in your life, but it's His process.
[time=2763] Isn't that wonderful? It's all of God. I can rest.
[time=2767] I can be assured. I can have hope when I fail.
[time=2772] He began it. He's going to finish it. He promised me that.
[time=2777] Well, what's He doing in you? Look at verse 13 again.
[time=2780] To be a little more specific, it is God who is at work in you, both to do two things.
[time=2787] To will and to work for His good pleasure.
[time=2790] To will He wants your will to be in line with what pleases Him.
[time=2795] He's not talking about your emotions, not a whim, not an impulse.
[time=2799] The studied, deliberate, intention, will of the believer.
[time=2803] He wants that to be brought into conformity to what pleases.
[time=2806] He's working inside of you to change your will, to conform it to His pleasure.
[time=2811] Doing that, you exercise your will to be involved in good works or acts, as I think the NIV says.
[time=2819] To will and to act for His good pleasure.
[time=2821] That's a lifetime full of good deeds of bringing people to Christ and discipleship and loving your family and giving to the glory of God and all the rest of it.
[time=2830] So He is at work inside of you to produce a will and a behavior pattern that resounds to His glory.
[time=2842] Well, let me wrap it up this way.
[time=2845] Some of you have been studying the book of Philippians with us for a few weeks.
[time=2848] You know the meaning. What is the theme of Philippians? Joy.
[time=2852] The book of Philippians is about the Christian emotion of joy, deep-seated happiness.
[time=2857] We're in a primer on how to know the joy of God. Let me show you the development of the thought just as we wrap this up.
[time=2862] Come back to chapter 1 for just a minute.
[time=2864] You remember Paul starts in chapter 1 by telling us he can have joy even though his circumstances are falling apart.
[time=2870] He's in prison now for four years in a row.
[time=2873] Verse 12, "I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel."
[time=2879] The thing that brings joy in his life about his circumstances is the person and the purpose of Christ.
[time=2885] And if in these adverse circumstances Christ can be exalted and his purpose can be advanced, I'm a happy camper.
[time=2893] Then he moves on to an even more intimate area of our life and that's the relationships of our life.
[time=2898] And you remember these men that he had discipled and trained all of his life?
[time=2901] Some of them had turned against him in his imprisonment and were preaching the gospel with strife and envy and selfish ambition
[time=2907] trying to take his position as leader and he knew it.
[time=2910] Nothing causes pain more than that to have your friends betray you.
[time=2914] Look at verse 18, what then?
[time=2916] Only that in every way, whether in pretense as those who were full of envy and strife or truth, those who were preaching from pure motives.
[time=2924] Doesn't matter, if Christ is proclaimed in this I rejoice and I will rejoice.
[time=2929] So even the relationships in my life, I look at them through the grid not of how they treat me, but as to how I can be used of God
[time=2937] to further Christ and the cause of Christ. And if Christ can be furthered through the way I treat these people then I'm happy, I'm full of joy.
[time=2947] Then you remember he was waiting to find out if he would live or die and so he knew joy even with his own well-being in question, life or death itself
[time=2955] because Nero could decide that very morning to put him to death and he'd be dead by sundown.
[time=2960] So how are we to handle it when our own physical health and well-being is held in the balance?
[time=2965] Look at verse 20, he said, "That didn't rob my joy, according to my earnest expectation and hope, that I shall not be put to shame in anything, but that with all boldness Christ shall even now as always be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death."
[time=2980] My joy, my excitement, the thrill of life for me isn't whether I live or die, it's knowing that in either case Christ is exalted.
[time=2988] That's the number one vantage point, that's the source of joy. And then he says even as a citizen, remember verse 27, only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[time=2997] The word conduct is my behavior as a citizen, a citizen of Rome as he was, but better than that, a citizen of heaven.
[time=3005] I even view my government and the circumstances in which I find myself as a member of a nation, whatever they do to me, whatever they take from me, however they treat me, it doesn't matter to me
[time=3014] because I find my citizenship in heaven to be the most important one, and I'll walk in a manner worthy of the gospel.
[time=3021] So he says at the end of verse 27, "I strive together for the faith of the gospel, there's my joy, there's my excitement, there's my hope."
[time=3030] And as you come through that, looking at your circumstances and relationships and your own physical well-being and even your position under the government, and it's all for Christ, and it's all for the purpose of Christ, somebody wants to stand up and scream,
[time=3043] but what about me? Don't I count? I'm an individual, you know, and I have desires of my own. Doesn't it matter what happens to me?
[time=3053] Am I a non-entity? And he answers the question. Look at chapter 2, verses 3 and 4, "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another is more important than himself.
[time=3068] Don't merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests of others." The point is this, yes, you do not matter.
[time=3076] Correct, you got it. You are an instrument in the hand of God, and what happens to your life is absolutely of no consequence so long as it resounds to the person and the praise and the progress of the gospel of Jesus Christ."
[time=3088] You say, "No." I say, "Yes." Look at verse 5, "Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although he existed in the form of God, although he started at the pinnacle of all existence, God himself, look how he gave his life away, emptied himself, taking the form of a bondservant being made in the likeness of men," verse 8, "being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross."
[time=3117] Yeah, that's right. That's the standard. That's the example. That's the height through which we should attain in our willing to give up our interests and our self-interest and our selfishness and become absolutely selfless for the cause of Christ and the purpose of Christ.
[time=3129] Remember last week we looked at that and said, "Uh-oh, that's too much. I shrink from such a standard. I don't know if I can do it. I look honestly at my life."
[time=3138] And I say, "Count me out. It's just too much. I'm too intimidated by it."
[time=3145] So he says in verses 12 and 13, "Don't give up. Don't shrink back. Don't step away from the challenge. Step up to the challenge."
[time=3152] Verse 12, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Look at the example of Christ and allow it to inspire you to recommit and rededicate and resolve once again to live with a greater sense of selflessness than you've ever seen in your life before."
[time=3167] And then verse 13, "The refreshing, cool breeze of knowing that God is the one who will uphold you and sustain you and undergird the path of your life and even though at times you would be kicking against the tide, feel confident that he'll move you in his own way and his own time.
[time=3185] He'll orchestrate the events of your life to begin to work on your will and on your actions and you will resound to his pleasure because the process is all of God."
[time=3196] Does that make sense? Do you see the wonderful flow of the Word of God as he tries to help us grapple with the personal struggles in our lives?
[time=3206] It's a marvelous account.
[time=3211] I want to close this morning with just two reflections, two thoughts, one about verse 12 and one about 13, and I trust you'll just open your heart to this.
[time=3221] With respect to verse 12 and the call to make a greater commitment to the cause of Christ, is there something he wants you to change in your life today?
[time=3232] Is the Lord putting his finger on something in your life that needs to be repented of?
[time=3237] Maybe it's a habit that needs to be changed. Maybe it's a relationship that you need to humble yourself and make right or maybe you need to break that relationship off altogether.
[time=3248] Is there an attitude that he's put his finger on that he wants to change, a desire inside of you he wants you to ignore, a longing he wants you to cultivate, a ministry he wants you to commit to, a spiritual duty he wants you to begin or to resume?
[time=3263] An area of faithfulness you need to be involved in again, a wrong that he would have you to write, and I would say this to you, work it out, work it out.
[time=3273] Struggle, agonize, fight, strive, kick, grunt, groan, push, pull, and work it out for the glory of God. Get it straight.
[time=3285] Take your volitional powers you've been given as an image bearer and change it.
[time=3294] But secondly, from verse 13, I want you to notice something about the example we find in Christ that we can't find in any other great example that's ever lived.
[time=3303] If you think of some of the great examples, Abraham Lincoln, for example, he sets a huge standard for leadership and many study his life trying to learn from his example and imitate his example and are inspired by his example or Mozart as a great composer and performer.
[time=3320] Or Michael Jordan on the athletic court sets this huge, at least, athletic standard for all the other athletes who will ever play the game of basketball.
[time=3330] You know something about all these great examples? All they can do is inspire.
[time=3337] Christ not only inspires, he enables. He enables. Abraham's Lincoln spirit does not come back and climb inside of you and enable you to be a great leader.
[time=3354] Mozart's spirit doesn't come back and come inside of you and enable you to great musical performances.
[time=3362] Michael Jordan, much to the chagrin of 500,000 young kids all over the world today, his spirit doesn't come back inside of them.
[time=3371] When he retires from basketball, his spirit can't empower them to anything.
[time=3377] All they can do is inspire. Christ not only inspires, he enables.
[time=3385] Through his own death on the cross and his ascension, he sends us the Holy Spirit.
[time=3390] Just as he said, "I do not leave you as orphans. I send you the Holy Spirit."
[time=3397] And so his example stands supreme of all the examples, both in the personal sacrifice it involves and the power it can bring into your own life to live differently.
[time=3408] Let's pray together.
[time=3415] It's been our privilege to bring you the Bible hour again. I hope you enjoy the music from our sanctuary choir and orchestra and special guests, the Chamber Orchestra from Cedarville College in Cedarville, Ohio.
[time=3426] The message today was a continuation in the series from the Book of Philippians from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3434] Just last week I received a letter from a lady that bowed at the close of our service and asked Christ to come into her heart.
[time=3440] I'm going to pray that prayer of repentance again today. If you need to trust Christ as your Savior, let's pray this prayer together.
[time=3447] Dear Heavenly Father, I am so thankful that you sent Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3453] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and become my Savior today.
[time=3460] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3464] If you prayed that prayer today, write us and tell us the nature of your decision. When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
