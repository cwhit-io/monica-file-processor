[time=15] Are we going to be the typical complaining, harping, mumbling, grumbling, demanding, insisting, consumer satisfaction oriented American or are we going to have in our heart the purpose and the plan and the person of Christ so that in circumstances where our needs are may not be met and where people may bamboozle us and take advantage of us, we may register some issue of complaint but our overriding emphasis isn't upon getting what we want and demanding our rights and holding our grudges and insisting and demanding our whole life is all about telling people about Christ and we find it very difficult to do that when we're demanding our own rights.

[time=72] >> Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=81] Thank you for joining us.
[time=82] We live in a society that loves to complain.
[time=86] We're the culture of complaint.
[time=88] We take issue with everything from the weather to conditions at work to the number of commercials that interrupt our favorite TV program.
[time=95] We seem to be the most indulged society in the world and at the same time the most discontent.
[time=101] Well today our study from Philippians chapter 2 gives us helpful perspectives about how and why to bring complaining under control.
[time=110] Our special music today will be provided by Scott Schindler and Reflection, and let's join our sanctuary choir
[time=124] and soloist read the favor as they begin our service.

[time=626] You'll enjoy it.
[time=627] Your entire family will enjoy it.
[time=630] Well, I want to tell you about November 13th.
[time=632] That's the day when we distribute living Christmas tree tickets to the general public.
[time=637] We'll begin at 9 a.m. here at the worship center lobby of the Blackhawk Baptist Church, and then we will give tickets away until they're gone.
[time=645] Russell, that's a very exciting day.
[time=647] There are a number of people that come, and we really do endeavor to try to give them the tickets that they need for each particular night.
[time=655] Now, it's interesting.
[time=656] In that one day, this November 13th, all the tickets are going to be gone.
[time=661] We have a distribution for our members through envelopes.
[time=664] And then that day, whatever we have left, which is hundreds of tickets, are all gone.
[time=669] And we do put people on a waiting list as they call in.
[time=673] And we have volunteers that we'll call then as tickets sometimes are returned back to us.
[time=678] And then we go down the waiting list and try to accommodate everybody that wants to come to the tree.
[time=684] Some 20,000 people.
[time=687] That's a phenomenal musical event.
[time=689] How did you ever settle in your heart to even go into the music ministry?
[time=695] I think that you go clear back to my college days when I started as a PE major in college
[time=701] and by the second semester changed to music because growing up in a pastor's home, I was always involved with music.
[time=708] And I knew that there were a lot of coaches that were really helping young men in their lives and keeping them morally straight.
[time=714] And I felt that that wasn't true in music.
[time=717] There was a dearth of men that were helping out in the field of music.
[time=721] And I really believe that there are a lot of men who are athletically inclined that also have a great appreciation for music.
[time=728] And we just try to combine the two in our ministry.
[time=732] And it's interesting, you have quite a few good athletes in the choir.
[time=736] You've got a couple softball teams?
[time=738] Yeah, we have two softball teams.
[time=740] One of the teams, the red team this summer, was undefeated, won the tournament, won the league championship that they were in.
[time=745] It's a great time of fellowship, but they are fine athletes, good singers and great athletes.
[time=750] And they combine both of their talents as they minister through our sanctuary choir.
[time=755] Now, how many volunteers are actually going to participate in the living Christmas tree,
[time=761] whether musically or behind the scenes, mechanically in some way?
[time=764] Well, we have about 160 this year that are preparing to sing in the living Christmas tree.
[time=769] Due to work commitments and so forth, we probably have between 150 and 140 and 150 that sing each night
[time=776] because of illness or whatever might happen.
[time=779] We have probably 20 children that will be involved.
[time=782] And then there's probably 250 people behind the scenes, sewing, preparing food, babysitting,
[time=789] parking cars, ushering, just doing a number of things that really make this program successful.
[time=797] And it is directly the success of the programs directly attributed to our volunteers.
[time=804] Well, there's no way we could ever offer that free of charge without their volunteer services.
[time=809] That's absolutely true.
[time=810] So, once again, we just really want to remind you that the living Christmas tree is for you and you can receive tickets by coming to the public distribution on Sunday.
[time=820] That is Saturday, November 13th, beginning at 9 a.m. and we'll distribute tickets until they're gone.
[time=827] So, I'm glad that you've tuned in to the Bible Hour today.
[time=831] Our pastor is going to continue a series of messages in the book of Philippians.
[time=835] I've already heard some of what he's going to say today, and I can assure you that they're going to be pertinent things that you need to deal with in your own life.
[time=845] Things like, "When do I complain? Is that really a part of my life?" Or, "What's the difference between complaining and just asking some questions?" Stay with us for the Bible Hour and the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=884] [MUSIC - 171 seconds]
[time=1079] Amen. Thank you, Reflection.
[time=1083] Well, let me invite you to take your Bible again this morning and come with me to Philippians chapter 2 as we continue our study in the book that God has put before us for this time and this place.
[time=1098] And I thought I might begin this morning by giving you a quiz, maybe a 10-question quiz.
[time=1105] It's not true and false, it's still in the blank, and you don't need a pencil or a paper because the same answer is the correct answer for all the questions.
[time=1112] So all you have to do is come up with the right answer once.
[time=1115] Here are the questions.
[time=1117] What do we like to do or tend to do about the following?
[time=1123] Number one, long lines.
[time=1126] High prices.
[time=1129] Food that isn't prepared exactly to our liking.
[time=1136] People who talk too loudly.
[time=1140] Smokers smoking in a non-smokers section.
[time=1146] Noisy inconsiderate neighbors.
[time=1150] Clothing that fits too tightly.
[time=1153] Flat tires.
[time=1155] A phone call just when you sat down to relax sometime in the evening.
[time=1162] Or bad weather.
[time=1165] What's the answer?
[time=1167] Complain.
[time=1168] Look at Philippians 2, verse 14.
[time=1173] It says here that we are to do all things without grumbling or disputing,
[time=1179] and that is a tough standard for an American.
[time=1183] We are so committed to having things exactly like we want them that we are the culture of complaint.
[time=1190] We have an oversense of self-indulgence and we have a sense of demandingness that absolutely insists that our sense of well-being be maintained, that our desires and wants be maintained, and if it doesn't happen that way, we complain.
[time=1205] And I ran across an article this week out of Money Magazine, and in fact it's titled How to Complain on the Road.
[time=1213] It's for travelers, and they want to make sure that the traveler knows how to properly complain and get what he wants.
[time=1218] Listen to just a few things.
[time=1220] In the opening paragraph it says this.
[time=1222] Knowing how to register a gripe is often the key to getting what you want.
[time=1228] Then these eight tactics of how to effectively complain.
[time=1233] Here's one of them.
[time=1235] Always stand up for your rights.
[time=1238] Here's another one.
[time=1240] If all else fails, demand a perk or a discount.
[time=1244] If they can't give you exactly what they promised, then you demand something extra.
[time=1248] Here's another one.
[time=1249] Don't turn passive.
[time=1251] Stay strong.
[time=1253] Another one.
[time=1255] Incest on the promised rate.
[time=1258] They give a hypothetical.
[time=1259] If you were promised 39 bucks a night and it's going to be 49 bucks a night, explain that you plan to call the company's customer service department for satisfaction.
[time=1268] If that doesn't change the issue, then you're supposed to memorize this little line.
[time=1271] Here it comes.
[time=1272] Ready?
[time=1273] Quote.
[time=1274] If I walk away, you're speaking to this person at the desk, you are not only losing my future business, I will send a letter to the president of your company with your name in it.
[time=1288] That'll get you some results.
[time=1291] Now, just when you said that, then say, and by the way, do you have a second I'd like to talk to you about your relationship with Christ.
[time=1299] Gotcha.
[time=1301] It was all making sense there for a minute, wasn't it?
[time=1304] Number seven, make it clear that you are a valued customer.
[time=1310] And number eight, if you absolutely fail to get satisfaction on the road,
[time=1317] hold your grudge until you get home.
[time=1321] And when you do, do the following things.
[time=1324] Call the company's consumer affairs office.
[time=1328] Number two, write a letter to the customer service desk and send copies to the president of the company and the chairman of the board.
[time=1337] If you still can't find satisfaction, then get in touch with the appropriate agency in Washington, D.C. and sick the bureaucrats on this poor fledgling little business.
[time=1347] Now, could you imagine?
[time=1349] The apostle Paul did quite a little bit of traveling.
[time=1354] If this was his practice, as he went to Philippi, as he went to the city of Ephesus,
[time=1360] as he went to Thessalonica, if his number one agenda in life was to get satisfaction,
[time=1367] and if he didn't get it, he had a list of ways to demand insists that he did.
[time=1375] It's interesting how we are here in America.
[time=1378] Some of you are saying that it's snowing rather early in the season, and some of you are saying it with a rather complaining tone in your voice.
[time=1386] Some of you are wishing you lived in Florida, or someplace like California.
[time=1391] It may interest you to know that this time last year, we had already had two inches of snowfall,
[time=1399] and this time two years ago, we had already had six inches of snowfall.
[time=1405] So just take that and put it in your complaining pipe and smoke it.
[time=1412] See, complainers, some of you are complaining that the cost of living has gone much too high,
[time=1420] and you're simply not making enough money.
[time=1424] Well, take it up with the pavement dwellers of Calcutta, who complain each night that they can't find a rag
[time=1433] to cover their body with as they fall asleep.
[time=1437] Some of us, and I need to get myself in this because I am in these categories, complain that our food is too cold, or it's not served just the broccoli is a bit soggy,
[time=1447] don't you think, honey?
[time=1449] We'll take that one up with the 10,000 people who starve to death every day on planet Earth.
[time=1458] We're at complaining sort because we're grossly over-indulged, and we suffer under the notion that our rights are preeminent, and we must get what we want all the time.
[time=1470] The Word of God in this epistle of joy, and God intends us to know joy,
[time=1476] and to know the excitement and the thrill of life, and to be happy people, is saying to us that the joy of God is not found in demanding your own rights,
[time=1486] and when they are not fulfilled by grumbling and disputing, they are instead found by tying yourself to the person and the purposes of Christ,
[time=1496] and knowing that in every situation you have an opportunity to represent the interest of Christ in that conversation, in that scenario, and that joy can come as we pursue that great cause.
[time=1510] Now we need to balance that, and I want to as we go on, but that is the beginning point of our understanding.
[time=1516] Paul, in this letter, as you know in chapter 2, verse 3, is saying this, "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit." He goes on to illustrate that in the life of Christ, how Christ was willing to leave the heavenlies and suffer humility all the way to the point of dying, not because he did something wrong, but for your behalf and my behalf.
[time=1535] He was not selfish, and he did not do things out of empty conceit.
[time=1539] And what he is saying to us is as we emulate Christ, as we go about this world, and we're living for the interests of other people, and we're seeking the betterment of the cause of Christ in their life, we're not to do that with a poor me attitude, with slunch over shoulders and kind of, well, I'll help you, but boy is it putting me out.
[time=1557] Boy is this difficult.
[time=1559] My, you're asking a lot of me.
[time=1561] There is supposed to be a magnanimous, gracious, loving self-sacrificial service
[time=1567] attitude in our hearts such that when we do make these sacrifices, it's not full of grumbling and complaining and disputing.
[time=1574] We've risen above that.
[time=1576] We've found another reason to live, and that's Christ.
[time=1580] Now, before we look at the specifics of this text, I want to invite you to the Old Testament for a minute.
[time=1584] If you want to turn, come with me.
[time=1586] We'll go to Numbers chapter 13.
[time=1588] If you're familiar at all with the Bible, you know that the number one group of complainers in all the history of the time recorded by the Bible are the Israelites.
[time=1599] They grumbled about everything.
[time=1601] But there is this one incident that really gives us some foundational principles about grumbling, about complaining.
[time=1608] Numbers chapter 13.
[time=1611] Verses 30 and following.
[time=1615] Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses and said,
[time=1621] "We should by all means go up and take possession of it for we shall surely overcome it." What's the situation?
[time=1628] There are some two million Israelites waiting outside the land of Canaan, the promised land, and God has told them that's the very reason I brought you out of the land of Egypt.
[time=1635] If you need to go into that land, you need to conquer that land, and you will build yourself a nation there.
[time=1640] And as a nation of Israel, you will be the ones who will spread the knowledge of the true and living God to all the other nations in the world.
[time=1648] And this conquering of this particular land was just part of the process.
[time=1651] And God had been miraculous in his provision for them all along the way.
[time=1655] You remember the parting of the Red Sea, for example.
[time=1657] It had never been their strength.
[time=1658] It had never been their ability.
[time=1660] It was always God providing supernaturally to accomplish this great objective.
[time=1665] They come to the edge of the promised land, and God says, "Send twelve spies in." Caleb and Joshua came back and said, "We should do this." You just read that, verse 30.
[time=1675] We ought to go up in there, but listen to the remaining ten, verse 31.
[time=1680] But the men who had gone up with him said, "We are not able to go up against the people, for they are too strong for us." And there was, from a human perspective, some truth to that.
[time=1690] These people had lived in the land of Canaan for a long time, and they were protected in city states and city forts and huge walls and refined weapons of war.
[time=1700] And Israelites, they were coming through the desert.
[time=1702] They didn't have anything hardly at all.
[time=1704] How are they going to fight all these people?
[time=1705] There was some truth to that statement.
[time=1707] Verse 32.
[time=1710] So they gave out this bad report to the sons of the land that had spied out saying, "The land through which we have gone, inspiring it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants, and all the people whom we saw in it are men of great size." There also, we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, are part of the Nephilim.
[time=1730] And we became like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.
[time=1734] Apparently, there were real huge human beings, giant-like human beings that inhabited this land.
[time=1740] And so, in addition to the weapons of war that the inhabitants had, they also had huge people, and these ten reported back a bad report to the land,
[time=1749] or of the land to the people.
[time=1752] Well, first point I want you to notice about grumbling, is grumbling is primarily against God Himself.
[time=1759] God is the sovereign of this world.
[time=1761] God sovereignly orchestrates all the experiences of the people of Israel's lives just like He does our own.
[time=1768] And so, though you may be directing your complaint at your boss, you may be directing your complaint at your church, or your pastor, or your elders, or your wife, or your husband, or your kids.
[time=1779] Whoever you may be complaining about or at, they are really secondary, and you are ultimately complaining at the God who brought those people into your life.
[time=1789] Ultimately, complaining is complaining against God.
[time=1794] Come over a page, if you're with me in Numbers, to Chapter 14.
[time=1798] And look at verse 36.
[time=1800] We'll learn another thing about grumbling.
[time=1803] This is intriguing.
[time=1804] As for the men who Moses sent to spy out the land, and who returned, and made all the congregation grumble against Him by bringing out a bad report concerning the land, these guys not only brought a bad report out against the land, by doing so it says in that verse that they made all the congregation grumble against Him.
[time=1825] What does that mean? Well, grumbling is contagious.
[time=1829] Grumbling is infectious.
[time=1832] All you need are a couple of disgruntled people inside a company, a business, a church, anywhere, a football team.
[time=1839] All you need are a couple of people who want to look at the negative side and want to speak against the purpose of that organization, and eventually that negative attitude can spread through the entire place.
[time=1851] And everybody then turns against that direction.
[time=1855] In the case of the church, everybody turns against and is derailed from the purposes of God.
[time=1861] One person I read this week said it this way.
[time=1863] We have no more right to put our discordant states of mind into the lives of those around us
[time=1870] and rob them of their sunshine and brightness than we have to enter their houses and steal their silverware.
[time=1877] In other words, grumbling is so contagious that when you sit down with someone else
[time=1883] and you begin to do your complaining thing, you steal from them their joy and their sunshine and their sense of willingness to follow God's leading in their life. However difficult, you steal that from them because you infect them with your bad attitude, your bad perspective, your negative way of looking at things.
[time=1903] And it says bad, so says the quote, as going into their home and stealing their precious silver.
[time=1910] Obviously joy and peace of mind are of greater value than some silver.
[time=1915] So secondly, we learned that complaining is infectious and it's contagious and you do your friends a disservice by spreading your malcontent attitude to them about it.
[time=1929] Look at verse 37, we'll learn something else. How does God feel about this?
[time=1933] Even those men who brought out the very bad report of the land died by a plague
[time=1939] before the Lord. The Lord brought a plague and killed these guys.
[time=1943] I don't think he considers it a minor offense. Why?
[time=1949] And particularly now with the people of God, when you have grumblers in the assembly, whether the nation of Israel or the New Testament church, this church or any other church, and they begin to speak against the leadership and the direction of God that God has for that church.
[time=1964] They spread their bad report and pretty soon the church no longer fulfills the purpose that God has.
[time=1971] What happened in the Old Testament account was they grumbled and the people grumbled and God then sentenced this entire generation of people to wander in the desert until they died.
[time=1983] And the purpose of God to raise up the nation of Israel to be a light to all the other nations was put on pause or hold until these people could die and another generation was raised up.
[time=1993] So in other words, when you grumble inside the assembly of God, you are tampering with that assembly's
[time=1999] effectiveness to accomplish the work of God. You put God on hold as it were.
[time=2004] We know that God is sovereign and undaunted in his purposes, but as he works with humans, somehow it works out that the whole program slows down and you're at fault.
[time=2014] And God feels very strongly about that. Why? Because God loves the unbeliever.
[time=2018] God loves the unsaid and God needs a church that will stand together in total unity focusing on the objective of reaching the lost.
[time=2030] So it's important stuff. What have we learned then from the Old Testament on grumbling?
[time=2034] One, that you're grumbling or complaining is directed ultimately at God who sovereignly orders your circumstances.
[time=2039] Two, that grumbling is an infectious thing that can poison and derail the people of God from their mission.
[time=2047] And thirdly, that God takes it very seriously and cautions us against it.
[time=2053] Okay? Back to Philippians now. With that kind of as a backdrop or an introduction, kind of a frame of reference, let's find out how it works out in the lives of the Philippians New Testament Church. Philippians 2, 14, 15, and 16, do all things without grumbling or disputing.
[time=2072] That you may prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world
[time=2082] holding fast the word of life so that in the day of Christ I may have caused a glory because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain. What does he mean by grumbling?
[time=2092] Verse 14, grumbling is an emotional reaction to God's sovereign plan in your life.
[time=2100] It's more of an emotional word than an intellectual word.
[time=2104] It is kind of a low toned muttering against God or against whoever it is you're directing your muttering.
[time=2112] This is not a public statement of reproach or discontent with a particular direction.
[time=2118] This is the kind of stuff that happens in the car on your way home and you say to your family or you say to a friend, "Mum-um-um-um-um-um-um-um-um-um-um-um-um-um-um." About whatever it was you didn't like. These are your grumblings that happen more in private.
[time=2133] This is the kind of stuff that happens when two or three people get together over coffee in a restaurant somewhere and somebody brings up the subject that they want to grumble about.
[time=2142] They bring a topic out and then they kind of get going and there's this grumbling and this murmuring. It's behind the scenes.
[time=2149] It's introduced by phrases like, "You know, I really like so-and-so, but there's just this one little thing."
[time=2155] See, that's the gateway and then they drive a truck through it.
[time=2159] All their bad attitude about so-and-so are such-and-such a place.
[time=2163] Sometimes it's this way. You know, forgive me for this, but this is just one of my pet peeves.
[time=2169] Gateway truck goes through.
[time=2171] Whenever somebody comes up to me and says, "You know, I probably shouldn't say this to you." But it's just one of my pet peeves.
[time=2177] I intellectually grab my invisible earplugs and try not to hear anything.
[time=2183] Because I know now I'm going to get this rehearsed, well-planned out bunch of junk
[time=2189] about somebody or our church.
[time=2191] Forgive me for saying this, but it's one of my "hot buttons." When you hear that stuff, you're on your way in to the murmurings and the grumblings, the emotional discontent with what God is doing in your life or in their life.
[time=2207] Now, disputing or arguing as the next word is in verse 14 is a little bit different.
[time=2211] It's more the intellectual side.
[time=2213] These are more the folks who analytically and critically stand aloof from a situation and come up with very profound thoughts about the church or the leadership of the church
[time=2224] or a particular situation.
[time=2225] For them, it's not so emotionally based.
[time=2227] You see, they're the erudite intellectual and they kind of give summary reviews of what's wrong or what could have been or how that might have been better.
[time=2237] And they may even do that publicly.
[time=2240] They tear down, not through emotions, but through kind of an intellectual analytical base.
[time=2246] And so Paul kind of covers both sides of the spectrum.
[time=2249] He's talking about your private grumblings with your friends and he's talking about from an emotional base and he's also talking about your critical analytical assessment of how it ought to be, how it might be done better.
[time=2262] Now, the issue here, as is the issue in all of Christianity, is the hard attitude.
[time=2268] God is not saying here that we don't have problems and that we can't address those problems.
[time=2273] God is not saying here that people let us down and when they do, it hurts us.
[time=2278] And there may be a place to give expression to that.
[time=2283] What he's saying is, when the hard attitude is to tear things down and beat people up and vent your own sense of anger or disappointment for your own therapy or your own sense of well-being because you get a rush out of being able to say negative things about other people, that's grumbling and disputing.
[time=2300] We know from the word of God that it says faithful.
[time=2303] Faithful are the wounds of a friend.
[time=2305] There's a place to be involved in someone else's life and say to them, you know, this could be done differently.
[time=2314] You're not reaching your potential in this particular area.
[time=2317] Or let me explain to you the way that that particular decision impacted me.
[time=2324] But those conversations typically are done face to face with the person involved.
[time=2328] It's not a third, fourth, fifth-party grumbling session.
[time=2331] There's a restorative attitude, there's a humility of spirit that's saying because I care about the purposes of God in this church because I care about you and your place, I want to share some things that I think can really help you.
[time=2345] You see the difference?
[time=2346] Huge difference between complaining, disputing and grumbling and those kinds of things.
[time=2351] Grumbling is an undermining, it stirs up negative feelings, it highlights in others' faults or failures, and it arouses suspicions and doubt.
[time=2361] And there is room for the other kind of faithful wounding that comes with real love and genuine support and is protective in the way that it says what it says.
[time=2371] Okay, so that's the standard.
[time=2373] That's what we ought to be as a church.
[time=2375] That's what we ought to be as a family.
[time=2376] I'm talking about the more family or your family.
[time=2378] Those are the kinds of tones that ought to really fill our home.
[time=2382] And when we hear the grumbling and we hear the disputing, we're in trouble.
[time=2386] Not just for our own personal discomfort, but then even our own families will fail to reach the purposes of God.
[time=2394] Often in the Word of God, we will be able to see these standards, no grumbling and disputing, supported with some reasoning.
[time=2403] And in this case, that is the case.
[time=2405] There are three reasons given in verses 15 and 16 why we should do everything without grumbling and disputing.
[time=2411] The first one, look in verse 15.
[time=2414] It says there that you may prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation.
[time=2424] The first reason you should fail or choose not to grumble and dispute is for your own sake.
[time=2429] For your own sake.
[time=2431] What is he saying here?
[time=2432] So that you can prove who you are, that you're really a child of God.
[time=2436] Sometimes in a family, there'll be a particularly gifted individual, maybe a mother who has exceptional athletic ability or she's exceptionally bright or these kinds of things, and you meet the daughter.
[time=2447] And you kind of look at the daughter and you wonder to yourself, now did she get that same gift?
[time=2452] And when you find that you say to yourself, "See, she's just like her mother." Well, that's what he's saying.
[time=2459] People who examine our lives should be wondering, do they have the same character as God?
[time=2466] Are they just like their father?
[time=2469] Hopefully they'll be able to say yes.
[time=2471] What are those characteristics in this context?
[time=2473] Well, there are three of them.
[time=2475] Verse 15, "That you may prove yourselves to be blameless." The first thing that we ought to look like as children of God is blameless, and that means that we can't be criticized.
[time=2483] Nothing can be taken a hold of in our lives and saying that we're responsible for some particular sin or selfishness.
[time=2490] There is no compromising in our life with right and wrong.
[time=2493] We stand for the truth. We're blameless.
[time=2497] The next one is the word innocent or pure, also found in verse 15.
[time=2503] To be innocent or pure means that we're unmixed, we're undefiled, we're genuinely people of character.
[time=2509] Our true longings are for the things of God and we're inexperienced with evil.
[time=2513] There's an innocent and a purity to us.
[time=2516] They look at us and they say, "Yeah, see, you're of the Father.
[time=2519] You're like your Father in heaven." And the last one is above approach, and that's a word that comes out of the Old Testament to describe the way a sacrificial animal would be brought for sacrifice.
[time=2529] The animal that is unblemished would come without a spot, or without a sore, or without scabs, without filth, without wounds.
[time=2539] And so our life is to be above approach.
[time=2542] We are to be found without the spot and the sores and the wounds and the scabs and the filth of sin that would be so characteristic of the people who are full of the crooked and perverse generation.
[time=2555] So he says, "For your own sake, for your own sake and your own happiness and your own joy, don't grumble and don't dispute, so that in fact you'll be blameless and innocent and above approach." Had an interesting situation with one of my daughters.
[time=2572] I think it was Sunday night.
[time=2575] And we had just had, last time that we had just had this bonanza weekend.
[time=2579] My folks came to town and took us to Chicago, and for the first time the girls got to see some really neat experiences going to the top of the Sears Tower, and they had us at a hotel that had all kinds of pools on the inside and Jacuzzis, and we were just going crazy.
[time=2594] We thought we'd died and gone to heaven, you know?
[time=2596] It was a super time, and they took us to the football game, the USC Notre Dame.
[time=2600] Well, we better change the subject, the SC Lost.
[time=2602] Okay, anyway, we did the football game and had a great time.
[time=2604] I mean, it was just exploded our senses.
[time=2606] It was so wonderful and perfect.
[time=2608] The weather was great, everything was super.
[time=2610] Sunday night, I come in from something late, and one of my daughters is kind of on the floor in her bed, you know, sleeping on the floor because mom and dad were in the bed, and she's kind of weeping a little bit, crying.
[time=2625] And so I said, "What's the matter?" "Well, you know, it's just really hard." I said, "What's that?" "Well, I had to go to bed earlier, and I heard that so-and-so got an ice cream, and I didn't get an ice cream.
[time=2643] I didn't get an ice cream." I didn't think in my last child, you have had everything in spades for the last three or four days, and you're crying about not getting an ice cream.
[time=2654] So I sat down and tried to work that perspective through with her, and as I'm doing this, I'm thinking about me, and I'm thinking about you.
[time=2664] I mean, in Christ, we have everything.
[time=2668] Forgiveness of sins, we're blessed with everything pertaining to life and godliness, everything we could possibly hope for, we're guaranteed a home in heaven.
[time=2677] I mean, it's a bonanza, not just for now, but forever.
[time=2681] And then some little trivial thing doesn't happen in our life.
[time=2686] We don't get an ice cream.
[time=2689] We begin to focus on that, and that steals our joy, and then we're sad, and then we're sorry, and then we're ineffective.
[time=2700] Man, don't focus on that stuff.
[time=2703] Don't grumble and dispute why for your own sake.
[time=2706] So you can prove that you're truly a child of God and that you know the blessings of being a child of God, and those blessings are enough for you.
[time=2714] So that should you have difficulty in struggles, and trials, and persecutions, and real hard things happen in your life, you can, like Paul, move through with purpose and real joy.
[time=2723] The second reason found also in verse 15 -- I, by the way, was proud of her response.
[time=2730] She did get the point, stopped her crying, and went to bed rather than thankful, or stayed in bed, and went to sleep rather than thankful.
[time=2737] It goes on to say, "Blameless and innocent children of God above her approach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you appear as lights in the world." The second reason is for the sake of unbelievers.
[time=2750] We need to fail to grumble and dispute for the sake of the unbelievers around us.
[time=2755] Notice in verse 15 it says, "In the midst of a crooked and perverse generation." Isn't it interesting?
[time=2760] God does not save us and then call us to hide and cower behind monastery walls secluded from the world.
[time=2766] He says, "We're in the midst of the world, in the comings and goings of life." It's there that we can be lights to a world that doesn't have any light.
[time=2777] Crooked and perverse generation, the word crooked, scoliosis of the spine, and that's a twisted spine
[time=2785] that in exaggerated cases can hunch a person over and interfere with their respiratory system and cause great pain.
[time=2794] That's the description of the generation in which we live there.
[time=2797] Crooked, they're twisted and they're perverse, meaning severely twisted.
[time=2802] And we're the only light they have.
[time=2805] We're the only hope they have of knowing the gospel and knowing Christ and the idea is just by who we are.
[time=2812] We are just emanating the light to this dark and perverse crooked world.
[time=2819] Now you got to know, survey for just a minute your workplace.
[time=2823] Is your workplace the king of criticism and complaint or not?
[time=2827] I mean, is that what it's all about?
[time=2829] Isn't that where all the discussions take place around the coffee machine or at lunch or at the desk or when you're left alone for a few moments, people just have a tendency to complain.
[time=2839] Supposing that you had worked there and never complained.
[time=2845] No, I'm not saying you were unaware of the problems and that you didn't effectively deal with some of the problems in appropriate biblical ways, but there was just never complaint coming out of your mouth.
[time=2856] People are going to notice a difference.
[time=2858] People are going to say, my lands.
[time=2860] What makes that person different?
[time=2862] And you haven't said a word yet about Christ.
[time=2865] All you've done is failed to complain, genuinely in your heart because you have your perspectives right.
[time=2872] Well, then they're going to come and ask, then they're going to want to know and then look at verse 16.
[time=2876] This is the second part of how you witness to them, holding forth the word of life, holding fast or holding forth the word of life, which is in classical Greek reference to somebody extending their arm to offer somebody a glass of wine, to quench some thirst, to meet a physical need.
[time=2895] You and I live like lights in the workplace, and suddenly people are saying how come you're different, and at that point you can offer them the word of life, which is nothing other than the gospel.
[time=2903] You can then articulate a person of Christ.
[time=2905] Have you ever done that?
[time=2908] Have you ever had the chance to do that?
[time=2911] Have you been living in such a way in your workplace, and of course not just grumbling, but your strong work ethic, and your honesty, and your integrity, and your willingness to stand up for what's right on behalf of your employer, or if you're an employer to treat people properly, and people come to you and say, "Man, you're different." And then you offer them, not a glass of wine, but the gospel.
[time=2934] And if you haven't, I hope you purpose in your heart this morning to live differently so that that'll happen.
[time=2938] That's why we're on the planet.
[time=2940] That's what this is all about.
[time=2942] Interesting, scoliosis in severe forms.
[time=2945] I learned this week.
[time=2946] You know how you fix it?
[time=2948] You have to break the person's back so that then you can straighten it with a thing called Harrington rods that begin to run up and down the spine, and then the person becomes erect.
[time=2959] Pain goes away, and they can function again, to some degree.
[time=2964] You know how people come to Christ?
[time=2966] Christ breaks their spirit.
[time=2969] They come to Christ because they've seen their sin in contrast to your light and they're broken over their own complaining, disgruntled attitude and all the harm that's brought to people in their life, for example, and they are broken over their sin, and then Christ comes and straightens them, and they can walk direct and become a part of the luminaries.
[time=2990] So there's great purpose there.
[time=2993] So our witness, we should not dispute or grumble because of a witness that is both who we are, just our character as we live and through our lips, what we proclaim.
[time=3004] Well, the third reason also found here in this text is for the sake of your spiritual mentor.
[time=3012] Looking at it in verse 16, holding fast or holding forth the word of life, so that in the day of Christ, I, he's speaking about himself, Paul.
[time=3020] I, Paul, may have caused a glory because I did not run in vain or toil in vain.
[time=3025] He's saying, "I'm anticipating the day when I stand before Christ, and Christ is going to look at the quality of my ministry." And if you folks, the Philippians, are involved in disputing and complaining and become derailed from the purposes of God for your church, I will have run in vain, and I will lose out on bringing glory to Christ the way I want to bring glory to Christ.
[time=3048] He's saying, "Be faithful in your own life for the sake of those who have poured their life into you.
[time=3054] Be properly spiritually indebted to those who told you the gospel and who led you to the Christ for the first time.
[time=3059] And those other people who came into your life and discipled you and spent time with you and encouraged you in the things of Christ.
[time=3065] You have a debt to pay, a wonderful blessed debt of being faithful to employ what they gave you." I think of that in my own life, my parents, and then Blaine Gibbs, the guy that discipled me the first year of my Christian life, and John MacArthur, and Bob Provost, and when I think about messing up and throwing in the towel and saying, "Forget it, I'll do something different, there's got to be an easier way to live." I think partly of those guys, and I think, "What would they say? How would they feel?
[time=3093] How could I do that?" Because of this remarkable investment that they made in my life over time, you have the same thing.
[time=3100] You have a responsibility to David Jeremiah and to Rick Hawks, men who have labored here in the Word and invested in you.
[time=3108] We can't derail, we can't get off track.
[time=3112] We need to be faithful for their sake, as well as for the cause of Christ.
[time=3117] It's a wonderful level of accountability, isn't it?
[time=3120] Those people deserve our best effort.
[time=3122] We want to maximize ourselves for their glory so that they can give their glory to Christ at His coming.
[time=3130] So it's a wonderfully intimate thought.
[time=3133] We're not out here by ourselves.
[time=3136] We're trying to be faithful to those who have invested in us.
[time=3140] So the passage is clear and it's simple.
[time=3143] Do all things without grumbling and disputing.
[time=3145] It's so absolute, it covers everything.
[time=3147] Relations with your wife, your kids, your work, your church.
[time=3151] Why?
[time=3152] Well, for your own sake, for the sake of the unbelievers and for the sake of those who have invested in you.
[time=3159] In closing, let me say just a few things.
[time=3167] Number one, this church, Blackhawk, you folks, you don't do a lot of grumbling.
[time=3174] There have been some pockets since I've been here, but they are minor and on the fringe.
[time=3179] The vast majority of you do not grumble.
[time=3183] You're a church that really works together and holds on to its unity.
[time=3186] And I think partly because of the elder board models that and shows a great example of that.
[time=3192] I want you to know I've been in a lot of meetings since I've been here with elders and senior staff members.
[time=3198] And everybody hasn't always agreed on everything.
[time=3201] It's not that we just presto come to the same conclusions.
[time=3204] And there can be some real discussion back and forth about which approach might be taken.
[time=3210] But invariably, it'll come to a point where one group of guys will say to the other group of guys, "You know, we don't have the corner on the trip.
[time=3219] We don't know.
[time=3220] This isn't doctrine.
[time=3221] This is an application of something in our church.
[time=3224] And we want to yield to you and to your perspective." That's great.
[time=3229] We want to yield.
[time=3230] We'll go with you on this.
[time=3232] And what's even more exciting is when they leave that meeting and they talk to people outside, they maintain that same position of yielding.
[time=3243] They don't go out and say, "Well, I was thinking of it differently." Because that is grumbling.
[time=3250] And so because we have a leadership team that's willing to, in humility, yield to another perspective and support that perspective, not just in the meeting, but everywhere they go in their church and their community, you have a church that stands in unity and strength and has been used of God.
[time=3266] And that's a wonderful blessing, something we should cherish and hang on to.
[time=3271] Something we should cherish and hang on to.
[time=3275] I've been in other churches where the guys leading the church would all vote unanimously without discussion, even though some of them really disagreed and then would go outside of the group and tell everybody how they disagreed.
[time=3290] And those churches are in ruins today.
[time=3294] So you say, "Man, what a little simple phrase.
[time=3297] Do all things without grumbling and disputing.
[time=3299] How important is that?
[time=3300] It is absolutely vital to the proper functioning of the family of God." And every time you refuse to grumble, every time you refuse to dispute, every time you shut down a situation where people want to go on and on and on about somebody or something, you are a contributor to the gospel of Christ going forward through this church.
[time=3322] So you have a vital part to play.
[time=3325] One closing thought.
[time=3326] This is one of those verses you might want to memorize.
[time=3329] Lamentations 3-9 says this.
[time=3333] Written by Jeremiah, the weeping prophet.
[time=3337] Jeremiah 3-9, excuse me, 3-39 says this.
[time=3341] Why should any living mortal or any man offer complaint in view of his sin?
[time=3350] That gets it down there, doesn't it?
[time=3352] Why should any living mortal or any human being ever offer a complaint in view of his own sinfulness?
[time=3358] What do we really deserve? Hell.
[time=3361] What do we really, if we get our just desserts, we're all in hell burning forever in constant torment.
[time=3366] Instead, the grace of God comes into our life, frees us from the penalty of our own sin, grants us eternal life, and so the question stands, why should any mortal or any human being ever offer a complaint in view of our own sin?
[time=3380] Comes back to a broken spirit in a humble heart and a delightful thought.
[time=3385] I can contribute to what God is doing on planet Earth.
[time=3390] Let's pray together.
[time=3416] Oh, I hope you enjoyed the inspirational music from our Sanctuary Choir today and soloist Reed LaFavor, as well as the music from Scott Schindler, our organist, and then finally the Ensemble Reflection, singing "Savior Like a Shepherd Leaders."
