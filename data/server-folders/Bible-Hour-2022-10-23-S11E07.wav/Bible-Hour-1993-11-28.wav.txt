[time=120] Just remember, Jesus, Jesus, how precious I give from your hand.
[time=133] Jesus, Jesus, my Lord.
[time=144] How could I have known when I came to Him alone?
[time=155] I'd leave with heaven in my heart.
[time=161] How could I have known?
[time=167] And how could I have seen what this quiet night would mean?

[time=406] Our special gift this month is the beautiful book by Johnny Erikson Tata, a Christmas longing.
[time=415] In it, Johnny writes a beautiful account of Christmas with all its joy and splendor.
[time=420] She's also illustrated this entire book with many full-color pictures.
[time=424] If you would like one of these books for yourself or for a friend, the Bible hour is offering them to you for a gift of $25 or more.
[time=432] Please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=440] [MUSIC - 247 seconds]
[time=707] Well, hello there and welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=709] It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas all over town, and I hope you're as excited about the Christmas season as I am.
[time=715] Well, for a number of weeks, we've been letting you know we want to talk to you about some of the financial needs of our ministry, and we'd like to do that even today.
[time=724] For the most part, the financial needs of the Bible hour are met by a group of people called the Founders Club.
[time=730] These are wonderful people who subscribe to our ministry and support it on a monthly basis, and they underwrite all the regular needs of our ministry.
[time=737] In fact, at the end of each year, it's not uncommon for us to have a couple of thousand dollars left over, and we'll set that aside in a special account for replacing capital equipment when that need comes along.
[time=749] And so, in general, our ministry is strong and it's being financially supported by these folks, and we're thankful for that because it means we don't have to come to you on a regular weekly basis asking you to give money.
[time=760] We can just present this ministry free of charge.
[time=763] However, there are some times in the life of our ministry when we do need to ask your help financially, and typically that'll occur when we're trying to buy new capital equipment, new cameras, or new editing machines, and that's what we're needing even right now.
[time=778] In fact, the editing equipment that we need to replace is about ten years old, and our technicians tell us that on a regular basis, as often as once a week, our tape machines will break, and they'll have to fix them, and they don't mind doing that,
[time=792] but they want us to know that sooner or later, the equipment will be beyond repair, and the Bible hour won't be broadcast that week or for another week until it's had to go out for special technical repair, and it's just moving beyond its lifespan.
[time=807] We've had our eye on some new equipment that's new on the market that would take us to a whole new level in technology and allow us to pursue a level of excellence we haven't been able to pursue even today.
[time=816] Let me show you a picture of this new equipment. It's called Media 100, and it's a nonlinear editing system.
[time=822] What that means is that the picture will go directly from the camera into the computer that you're seeing, and it won't involve a tape machine.
[time=829] It won't involve that kind of complicated process.
[time=832] The computer will allow us to edit the whole program right there on the computer, and then put it onto a tape where it can be sent to the television broadcasting station.
[time=842] We wanted to buy this for some time, but when technology is new, the cost is very high, and yet if we've waited as we have, typically the cost will drop, and that's exactly what's happened.
[time=853] So we've been waiting for the cost to drop, and we've continued to save money.
[time=856] Let me show you a little graph that shows how effectively we've been able to save some money.
[time=861] You'll notice that the Bible hour savings through the last number of years has risen now to where we have $21,000 in the bank.
[time=868] We also presented our need to the volunteer staff of the Bible hour television ministry, and they've donated some $3,000.
[time=875] And then we've had an individual donor give us $17,000.
[time=879] Well, that comes to a grand total of $41,000. We're excited about that.
[time=884] The equipment that we need is $56,000, and so if you subtract that, you'll find that we end up with a remaining need of $15,000.
[time=894] And we're coming to you as viewers of the Bible hour to help us meet that $15,000 need.
[time=901] So what I'm asking you this morning is to consider giving towards that $15,000.
[time=907] Maybe you could write us a check for $1,000 or for $500 or $100 as you anticipate your year in giving.
[time=915] We desperately need that help, and now is a time that we would like for you to contribute to our ministry.
[time=920] If you could mail your contribution to us at the Bible hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=930] That's 7,400 East State Boulevard, 46815, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=938] We are thankful that other people typically underwrite this ministry on a regular basis, and so it's only occasionally that we have to come and ask for your help.
[time=947] But we are doing that even today, and we would appreciate your help.
[time=951] We know through the correspondence we receive from people that people are coming to know the Lord through the Bible hour, and they're being encouraged.
[time=958] Many shut-ins can't come to church, and they receive their encouragement through us, and we'd love for you to help us with that.
[time=963] Thank you very much for considering our need.
[time=977] [piano music]
[time=984] A little girl is crying for affection.
[time=992] A little boy needs a hand to hold, and know how he loves those little children, how he wants to be a friend to young and old.
[time=1014] His tender spirit welcomes all who seek him.
[time=1021] His giving heart has nothing in return, and I have found his promises faithful.
[time=1036] I seek to live my life that I may learn.
[time=1045] To be like Jesus, to be like Jesus, to be the one I was created to be.
[time=1074] To be like Jesus, to be like Jesus.
[time=1090] May all who see my heart find him in me.
[time=1104] [piano music]
[time=1116] When I received his salvation, his heavenly love filled my earthly soul, and I became his new creation.
[time=1137] My brokenness he made completely whole, and through the darkness of this world I've been conditioned.
[time=1150] To be a light that shines for him alone, surrounded by his infinite mercy.
[time=1164] May my life always be known.
[time=1171] To be like Jesus, to be like Jesus, to be the one I was created to be.
[time=1193] To be like Jesus, to be like Jesus.
[time=1212] My only earthly gospel fear, when I'm centered in his way.
[time=1227] May all who see my heart find him in me.
[time=1242] [piano music]
[time=1262] Thank you, Becky.
[time=1283] We come to Philippians chapter 3, where a study of the book of Philippians, and we come to an exciting chapter in chapter 3, talking about salvation, and Paul really gives his personal testimony.
[time=1297] This is kind of an inside look at what happened and is described externally in Acts chapter 9 when Paul met Christ on the Damascus Road.
[time=1307] And in this passage we get to go inside and see the anatomy of salvation and see the transaction that occurred in his heart and his life as he gave up a way of life named, namely works righteousness and accepted salvation by faith through God, through Christ.
[time=1325] And to help us with this, I want you to notice that I have a watch with me this morning.
[time=1330] This is a gold watch, and when this watch was made it was back in the 60s, it was originally my grandfathers, he bought it in Switzerland.
[time=1338] It's one of those really expensive gold Swiss watches.
[time=1342] And back in the 60s, Switzerland had about 65% of the world watch market.
[time=1349] And about 80% of all the profits being made by selling watches were made by those who worked and lived in Switzerland.
[time=1356] They dominated the world market.
[time=1358] Ten years later, they only had 10% of the market share of the world and were forced to lay off some 50 or 60,000 expert Swiss watchmakers.
[time=1373] You see, what happened?
[time=1375] I mean, the Swiss had dominated the world watch market for about 100 years.
[time=1379] How come in a brief span of a decade, the whole thing reversed?
[time=1384] Well, you're wearing it today. It's a quartz movement watch.
[time=1388] It's the one that I normally wear.
[time=1390] And it was invented to just surpass this old kind of a watch.
[time=1394] It's got a little battery in here that runs it.
[time=1396] It's about 10 times cheaper and about 1,000 times more accurate.
[time=1399] It's remarkably versatile.
[time=1401] And today, it absolutely dominates the world watch market.
[time=1406] It's a great idea.
[time=1407] Who would have thought up, you know, powering this thing with a quartz movement and a little battery, as opposed to a main spring and bearings and all that kind of stuff?
[time=1415] And you say to yourself, the Japanese must have figured this out.
[time=1419] No, they didn't.
[time=1421] And then you go for second best.
[time=1422] Well, did we?
[time=1423] The Americans come up with this idea?
[time=1425] The answer is no.
[time=1427] The Swiss invented this watch.
[time=1431] In a little town called Nuschitel, which is about 40 kilometers outside of Lausanne.
[time=1438] And it was their practice to, as is often the case in great companies, to devote a large percentage or a certain percentage of their profits to research and development.
[time=1448] And in the own laboratories in Switzerland, the Swiss came up with the quartz movement watch.
[time=1454] They invented it.
[time=1456] And their researchers brought it to the presidents of their companies and said, "Look, we've invented this brand new watch and it's remarkably inexpensive.
[time=1464] It surpasses all of our quality standards as far as accuracy and time.
[time=1468] I mean, this is it." And the presidents of the company looked at it and said, "No, this isn't it.
[time=1475] It doesn't have a main spring.
[time=1478] And it doesn't have any bearings in it.
[time=1480] And it doesn't tick.
[time=1482] This isn't a watch." And so they just set it on the side.
[time=1490] Later that year, or I think the next year, they went to an international trade show of watches.
[time=1495] And they were so confident that it was useless and of no value.
[time=1499] They didn't even protect their invention by patent.
[time=1503] They kind of viewed it as a little novelty, so they put it out in one of their booths.
[time=1507] And Texas Instruments walked by of America, and Seiko of Japan walked by, and the rest is history.
[time=1515] They saw its value, and they now dominate the watch market.
[time=1520] So, well, good night.
[time=1523] How come these Swiss didn't see what they had?
[time=1526] How come they couldn't recognize it for the brand new innovative issue of the 80s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, and for who knows for how much longer after that?
[time=1534] What blinded them to that?
[time=1536] Well, as I've noted, it didn't have some of the really familiar characteristics of a watch, and I think beyond that, they were the experts of the world at this kind of a watch.
[time=1545] In fact, they prided themselves on this kind of a watch.
[time=1548] This was the stuff that they were experts in, and to divorce themselves from it, or to put it on a second burner, and to put this on the first burner, what would it mean about their pride, and all that accomplished, and all that they were, and their world-renowned commitment to these kinds of watches?
[time=1564] They couldn't see because they had so much personally invested in the old system they couldn't even recognize the new.
[time=1572] The same thing happens spiritually all the time.
[time=1579] People are confronted with the claims of Christ, and they say, "What do you mean salvation is by faith?" That's ridiculous. That's too simple.
[time=1591] Can't be. Salvation, you earn salvation.
[time=1594] You have to be better than your friends.
[time=1596] You have to be better than the normal people in society.
[time=1598] You have to work, you have to strive, and when you get to Heaven, God assesses your life.
[time=1603] He puts you on a scale, and if your good deeds outweigh your bad deeds, that's how you get into Heaven.
[time=1610] You can't get into Heaven by faith.
[time=1614] God can't give you Heaven. You must earn it.
[time=1618] You must work for it.
[time=1623] Well, as a result of that, they fail to see the beauty and the simplicity
[time=1629] and the wonder and the marvel of the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1633] And they reject coming to Christ in faith, and they reject true salvation.
[time=1637] They reject the only path to salvation, and they hang on to an old idea, and it dams them to hell forever.
[time=1646] The passage we're looking at is the internal reality of what happened in Paul's life when he gave up on the old idea, and he finally embraced the new.
[time=1657] When he gave up on an old system of works righteousness where he thought he could earn religious spiritual merit with God by his effort
[time=1667] and be weighed in the end and found to have enough to get into Heaven.
[time=1673] The day that he turned from all of that and said, "No, that's wrong.
[time=1677] The right way is through grace, through faith in Christ." Let's read the passage, and then we'll go back and look at it.
[time=1685] We can begin in verse 4.
[time=1688] Chapter 3, verse 4 says, "Although I myself, Paul speaking here, might have confidence in the flesh," he goes on to say, "If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more." He says, "You want to talk about the only way of viewing things.
[time=1702] I am the Swiss watchmaker of the religious world.
[time=1706] I've done it. I've got all the credentials." Listen to me now.
[time=1709] Verse 5, "I was circumcised the eighth day of the nation of Israel.
[time=1714] Now the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew, of Hebrews, as the law of Pharisee, as to zeal a persecutor of the church, as to the righteousness which is of the law, found blameless." He says, "Man, there's my list.
[time=1727] Those are my credentials. Those are my religious merits." "But," he says in verse 7, "Whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[time=1737] More than that, I count all things to be lost and view the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ, and may be found in Him not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith and Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, that I might know Him in the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His suffering being conformed to His death, in order that I may attain the resurrection from the dead." There's a huge transition that occurs in verse 7.
[time=1774] This "but," and by the way, this is the key to the whole text, "but whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake of Christ." The word "gain" is a word used of business.
[time=1787] It's a term to describe making a profit in business.
[time=1791] It's to describe an asset.
[time=1793] He's saying what all I had in me that was producing gain or profit or things of value,
[time=1799] I have now counted them as loss.
[time=1802] That word "loss" is also a word to describe a business loss, a financial loss.
[time=1807] You're no longer worth what you used to be.
[time=1810] More expenses than income.
[time=1815] He says there that I have counted them as loss.
[time=1819] It's another accounting word.
[time=1821] Really what he has in his mind here is a profit and loss statement.
[time=1824] He's saying all my life up to this point I've been working hard to put in the profit column these religious accomplishments in verses 5 and 6.
[time=1834] But when I met Christ, it was like my eyes opened up and I could finally see what was really there
[time=1840] and all of those assets turned into liabilities.
[time=1843] I went to the loss account of my profit and loss statement.
[time=1847] So he's viewing salvation as a transaction where he would have to give up all of his religious merit,
[time=1853] all of the things he tried to accomplish as an individual and rest totally and completely in the person of Christ for his salvation.
[time=1862] He even describes it stronger than a business statement.
[time=1864] If you look in verse 8, at the end of the verse, "For whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish," in order that I may gain Christ, the Greek word is scuba-lawn.
[time=1875] And it means two things.
[time=1876] One, garbage.
[time=1878] It means the kind of garbage you take out of your kitchen and you load it up in your trash can and then once a week you put it at the edge of the driveway and you hope somebody will come and take it away because it's useless.
[time=1888] It serves no purpose.
[time=1890] It is of no value.
[time=1892] You've already extracted all the things of value.
[time=1894] What is left now is the useless junk that you throw in the trash can and you desperately hope someone will
[time=1900] take it away because if they don't, it'll begin to contaminate you.
[time=1905] You've got to get it away.
[time=1907] He says, "All those religious accomplishments are nothing but rubbish to me." The word also means, this is a little graphic, but it also means human refuse, human excrement.
[time=1919] He's saying, "All my efforts at earning salvation, earning spiritual brownie points, I view them now as human excrement."
[time=1928] And again, what is that?
[time=1929] That is useless stuff.
[time=1931] All the value has been extracted and now it's just what remains and if it's not properly cared for and gotten out of the situation
[time=1938] and that's why we're civilized.
[time=1940] We have those sewage systems that get that stuff out of the system and it doesn't contaminate our water.
[time=1945] It doesn't contaminate our food because it's poisonous, it's damaging.
[time=1952] He's saying, "I spent my whole life trying to earn my way into heaven with a whole list of spiritual brownie points
[time=1959] and once I met Christ I recognized they were absolute rubbish and they had to get out of my life and they had contaminating potential if I didn't." A complete shift of his perspective about how to gain eternal life.
[time=1974] A total radical shift.
[time=1979] But with that as an overview, let's look at how it happened.
[time=1982] Let's look at specifically what he means.
[time=1984] And we'll begin with the seven religious credentials that don't impress God.
[time=1988] In verses five and six you're going to find seven religious credentials that don't matter to God.
[time=1993] He's not impressed, they don't move him, they don't tilt his scale.
[time=1996] He doesn't tip his hat, he doesn't say, "Oh my, look at you." In verse five Paul speaking from a Jewish perspective, the nation of Israel they were the covenant people of God.
[time=2008] He's saying, "I was circumcised on the eighth day when God made a special covenant with Abraham so many thousand years ago
[time=2015] by the time he wrote this.
[time=2017] God also gave them a sign, a physical sign called circumcision and that sign was to be a ritual of sorts
[time=2024] and an outward manifestation of a covenant that God had made with the people of Israel.
[time=2029] He also prescribed in the Old Testament that you be circumcised on your eighth day.
[time=2033] Not the sixth, not the seventh, not the ninth, not the tenth, but the eighth day.
[time=2037] It was very important.
[time=2039] Paul is saying not only was I circumcised, not only was I faithful to the cardinal ritual at birth,
[time=2045] not only was I nursed in the ceremonies of my ancestral tradition, but I was nursed at the proper time.
[time=2052] Even on the eighth day my parents were sensitive to the will and the word of God and they took me and had me circumcised.
[time=2059] He counted that a great, great spiritual advantage to gain entrance into heaven.
[time=2064] He had the mark of the covenant people.
[time=2069] The second one you'll find, also there in verse five, he was of the nation of Israel.
[time=2076] Of the nation of Israel and by that he doesn't mean generally the nation of Israel.
[time=2080] He means of Israel whose name was Jacob.
[time=2084] He's tracking his lineage back through Jacob and then Isaac and then Abraham because if you go on the other side of the tree,
[time=2092] you find you're the product of Ishmael and Esau and they produced Arabs.
[time=2098] They produced people who hate Israel and who would destroy all the Israelites if they could.
[time=2104] He was saying that only was I born to Abraham, I was born to Isaac and I was born to Jacob.
[time=2111] I was born on the right side of the family tree.
[time=2116] So I have the right race.
[time=2119] Thirdly he says that he was born there to the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=2123] As you know there were twelve and they were not all equal.
[time=2127] Judah had a special place for David and the Lord came through that.
[time=2132] Benjamin was probably second in rank.
[time=2134] They had a very unique place.
[time=2136] They were hailed as the tribe that when it was time for Israel to pick its first king they got it from the tribe of Benjamin.
[time=2143] Judges five noted that Benjamin, the tribe of Benjamin may have been the first end of battle.
[time=2148] They had a battle cry that went after the Obingement, after thee.
[time=2152] And so Benjamin was a high ranking tribe.
[time=2156] In fact Benjamin was the only one of the patriarchs who had been born in the Promised Land.
[time=2161] Consistent with the Old Testament religion they were looking for that kind of approval and that kind of status.
[time=2169] And so to say that I'm mentally of Jacob but I am a Benjamin is to say I was from a privileged tribe of great rank.
[time=2178] Those first three he had nothing to do with.
[time=2181] It's almost as if he's saying see by divine providence I didn't circumcise myself on the eighth day.
[time=2187] I couldn't do that and I couldn't be born into the tribe of Benjamin and I couldn't come through the line of Jacob.
[time=2194] You see it's almost as if God brings his pleasure upon me before I was born by his design.
[time=2204] The next one, the fourth one, he says he was a Hebrew of Hebrews.
[time=2207] What he means by that is he had maintained the tradition and the language of the Hebrew people which many Jews hadn't.
[time=2212] They weren't able to. They had been scattered abroad and their ancestors had lost their native tongue
[time=2218] and they had been forced to live in foreign countries and they had adopted the culture of those foreign countries and so they were secularized to use our terminology.
[time=2227] They weren't Hebrew of Hebrews anymore. They didn't carry out the Hebrew tradition and they couldn't speak the Hebrew language.
[time=2232] And Paul is saying not so with me.
[time=2235] My parents maintained all the Hebrew culture and all the Hebrew tradition and in fact I became fluent in the Hebrew language, Acts 21 tells us.
[time=2244] Beyond that he was sent to study under Gamaliel on Acts 22, or at least it's told us there in Acts 22 that he studied under Gamaliel,
[time=2251] who was the great, great Jewish thinker and teacher and espouser of doctrine of this day.
[time=2257] So he studied under the best of the best.
[time=2262] The fifth is that he was a Pharisee, a Pharisee.
[time=2266] There were only some 600 of them in his day.
[time=2270] It was an elite group of spiritual devotees.
[time=2274] Their emphasis was the very exacting keeping of the law.
[time=2278] In fact, they wanted to keep it so badly that they added extra laws, man's laws on top of God's laws
[time=2284] so they make sure they only broke man's laws and they were insulated from breaking God's laws.
[time=2289] It led to a very legalistic, damning way of religion, which the Lord confronted, but they were just totally committed to it.
[time=2297] And you had to remove yourself from all the normal activities of life to be considered a Pharisee.
[time=2301] It was a position of great sacrifice.
[time=2306] He goes on to say that he was blameless.
[time=2309] Number six, I believe, as the law of Pharisee, as to zeal a persecute of the church.
[time=2314] And then as to the righteousness which is in the law, I was found blameless, which means by human perusal.
[time=2322] If you inspect my life from the human vantage point, you'll not find me to have broken the laws of Israel.
[time=2327] I was above reproach.
[time=2329] And then, of course, he says, as to zeal, I was a persecutor of the church.
[time=2334] He was sincere beyond his wildest dreams.
[time=2337] He viewed Christianity as a threat to the nation of Israel.
[time=2341] And so he didn't just speak against them.
[time=2344] He got special permission to kill, persecute, and imprison them.
[time=2349] He was absolutely remarkably zealous.
[time=2352] He had won the awards of life.
[time=2355] He had won all the awards of Israel.
[time=2357] He had all the little decorations that his nation could award religious accomplishment.
[time=2366] And many of us struggle in the same ways.
[time=2368] And we know people who do, we think that by virtue of being circumcised, or some other ritual, maybe infant baptism, or some other kind of external right that the church offers that, oh, see, we're secure.
[time=2378] We're saved because of that.
[time=2380] But in fact, it has no religious merit with God.
[time=2382] God is not impressed.
[time=2384] Some of us think that it's not ritual.
[time=2386] It's our race.
[time=2387] We were born into a Christian family, or we were born into a Christian nation.
[time=2390] And by virtue of being in America, we're acceptable to God.
[time=2393] It grants you no standing with God, it grants you no standing with Christ, it doesn't bring you into the kingdom of God.
[time=2399] Nor does rank some of us thinking that because we're elders, or deacons, or have some position in the church, absolutely not.
[time=2405] It means nothing to God with respect to salvation.
[time=2410] Some would say, well, he was sincere, and others would say, I'm sincere in my religion, and we could think of the zeal of some priests around the world in false religious systems who carry great burdens of loneliness and self-flicking strikes to their own body, beating themselves
[time=2428] with all kinds of physical disorders and hardship, and it doesn't earn them any pleasure with God.
[time=2434] It grants them no points with the kingdom of God.
[time=2437] It's confusing because they think they deserve it because they've been so sincere and so dedicated,
[time=2444] but they don't deserve it.
[time=2446] It brings absolutely no merit with God.
[time=2448] He's not impressed.
[time=2450] He wants nothing to do with them.
[time=2452] He has nothing to say for them or for their accomplishments.
[time=2456] In our culture, we award people for extra effort.
[time=2461] Our great authors, we grant the Pulitzer Prize.
[time=2464] Our great warriors, we give a medal of honor or a Purple Heart.
[time=2467] Our great athletes, we declare most valuable players, or give them the Heisman Trophy.
[time=2472] Our producers and musicians and actors, we give Oscars and Grammys and Emmys,
[time=2478] and to our outstanding students, we declare them magna cum laude.
[time=2483] There's nothing wrong with those kinds of awards.
[time=2486] There's nothing wrong with recognizing extra effort on a human earthly level.
[time=2492] But when you assume that God works that way, it's a damning thought because you do not earn salvation.
[time=2499] You do not earn brownie points, and that is the point of his passage.
[time=2502] I've done everything I could possibly do from a human vantage point.
[time=2506] When I met Christ and I saw the truth about salvation, I saw it to be only rubbish, human refuse, garbage that needs to be thrown away.
[time=2519] So you say, "Well, what is the path of salvation?" Well, here are five things that he gained.
[time=2525] He says, "I gave up all my religious accomplishments.
[time=2528] I put those on the lost side, but here's what he gained." And he begins to recount them for us beginning in verse eight.
[time=2534] Five things that he gained at salvation.
[time=2536] Number one, he says in verse eight, "More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ." Well, he says, "I gained the knowledge of Christ.
[time=2556] I gained the knowledge of Christ, the true knowledge of Christ."
[time=2562] The great New Testament has two words for knowledge.
[time=2564] One is intellectual.
[time=2565] One is merely information.
[time=2567] The other word is an experiential knowledge.
[time=2570] It's a knowledge by intimate involvement.
[time=2574] When we were at the Master's College every year, we'd take the freshman to magic mountain.
[time=2578] It was just a few minutes away and there was this great ride there.
[time=2581] Six Flags Magic Mountain, there was this great ride there called Freefall.
[time=2584] Then you could stand there and you could look at this cage and it would get lifted up like an elevator about four or five stories and then it would move out and catch onto some rails that dropped straight down out of the sky for four or five stories.
[time=2596] A lever would release and this cage would drop and it would eventually flatten out and come to a stop some 30 or 40 yards down the track.
[time=2606] You could stand there and say, "I know about it.
[time=2608] I know about Freefall.
[time=2609] I understand Freefall.
[time=2610] I have an intellectual understanding of what that's all about." But then after you waited in line for two hours and you got in that cage and they hoisted you to the top and they rolled you out to the front and they let go of the lever and you felt your world fall apart and you felt your stomach rush up into your head and all of the sensations that went with it and you finally got out at the bottom you'd say to yourself, "Now you see.
[time=2632] Now I know.
[time=2633] I know about Freefall." What are you saying here is that I spent my whole life knowing about Christ, or rather God, knowing about religion, knowing about being right with God.
[time=2644] It was merely intellectual but when I came to Christ on the Damascus road I entered a vital union relationship with the person of Christ.
[time=2652] I knew him personally.
[time=2654] In John 17 verse 3 it says, "This is eternal life."
[time=2660] It says that, "They may know thee." This is eternal life that they may know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sin.
[time=2669] It's the same Greek word there.
[time=2671] Eternal life isn't knowing about Christ.
[time=2673] Eternal life isn't being able to answer a certain number of questions correctly about the person of Christ.
[time=2678] That's just intellectual knowledge.
[time=2680] True eternal life is having a personal intimate love relationship with Christ.
[time=2686] This word and concept in the Old Testament was used to describe the intimacy
[time=2692] of a marriage relationship.
[time=2694] It says there that Abram, excuse me, Adam knew his wife.
[time=2698] Adam knew his wife.
[time=2699] It means that he knew more about her than her name and what she looked like and how she got on the planet and what her characteristics were.
[time=2707] It's more than that.
[time=2708] It's more than knowledge about her because what it's referring to was their intimate physical relationship.
[time=2715] He knew her.
[time=2716] He loved her.
[time=2717] He was in relationship to her.
[time=2719] Paul is saying, finally, when I came to Christ, I knew him.
[time=2725] The second thing he gained is in verse 9.
[time=2728] It says there may be found in him not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ.
[time=2735] Here it is, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.
[time=2739] The second thing he gained was the righteousness of Christ.
[time=2743] He not only gained the knowledge of Christ, but he gained the righteousness of Christ.
[time=2748] Do you ever in the other people's attributes?
[time=2753] I do.
[time=2755] It's me in trouble sometimes, but yesterday watching the skins match and Freddie Couples, who's a great golfer and has this gorgeous, effortless golf swing that makes him millions of dollars.
[time=2769] I think it made him $90,000 yesterday in about two and a half hours.
[time=2773] Don't you hate people like that?
[time=2776] I was sitting there thinking now, I wish I had that swing.
[time=2780] If I just had that swing, wouldn't that be nice?
[time=2785] When I was teaching at the Masters College, I had a student named Paul Beto who was without question the most brilliant student I had ever had in my life.
[time=2792] Cher Genius went on to get his doctorate at Oxford and had to learn several languages to do it, and it was just no problem whatsoever.
[time=2799] You know, one of these huge intellects, but he had this unique ability to articulate truth.
[time=2804] He could study great theologians and communicate their theories and their thoughts and their kind of their subtleties with just a real eloquence.
[time=2812] I can remember just even as when he was a student in college saying to myself, "Man, I wish I had that brain.
[time=2817] I wish I had that ability." When I read through the Psalms and I get a little picture of David's heart and how passionately he loved God and how deeply he thirsted for the person of God,
[time=2830] I could find myself at times saying, "I wish I had his heart."
[time=2836] Well, what Paul is saying here is when you look at Christ, the thing about him you need most is his righteousness.
[time=2844] The thing with respect to your salvation that you need most about Christ is this particular attribute of his called his righteousness.
[time=2852] It's not his golf swing. It's not his intellect.
[time=2856] It's not even his emotions or his heart. It's his righteousness.
[time=2860] And true salvation, you are granted his righteousness.
[time=2863] It's given to you so that when God looks at you, he doesn't see you.
[time=2867] He sees the righteousness of Christ.
[time=2871] The third is in verse 10.
[time=2873] The third thing he gained that I may know him and the power of his resurrection.
[time=2878] He gained the power of Christ.
[time=2880] You say, "Why does it say the power of his resurrection?" Well, because of all the miracles that Christ did when he was on earth, the most powerful one was his resurrection.
[time=2889] It was when he raised himself from the dead that he said he had power over the physical universe.
[time=2893] He had power over the spiritual universe.
[time=2895] All the demons and Satan and the host of hell tried to hold him in the grave, but he had the power to break free.
[time=2902] It showed he had the power over sin.
[time=2905] It was unquestionably the greatest miracle that he ever did.
[time=2908] It was the most powerful evidence of his strength.
[time=2911] Paul says when I came to Christ, I got that power so that I can live faithfully and obediently all my life for the glory of God.
[time=2920] Salvation grants you and me the power of Christ.
[time=2922] And so a wife who is living with a man that doesn't love her and abuses her and is hard to her, that woman can claim the power of Christ and say, "I have what it takes to live obediently and faithfully to God to love this man who abuses me."
[time=2939] And I can live that way all my life by the power of God, because it is the power of Christ in his resurrection that now is mine.
[time=2949] A man who is stuck in a dead-end career and can't make a shift and finds himself doing things day after day he doesn't like, but underpaid for his efforts and yet he can say, "By the power of God, this is where God has me, and there are no other options, faithfully endure, and by the power of Christ I'll be a testimony to the glory of God."
[time=2971] It's the resurrection power of Christ that allows us to be unique as Christians to do what people who aren't Christians can't do.
[time=2981] Fourthly he says in verse 10, and this is interesting, he says, "I've gained a friend to have fellowship with in suffering."
[time=2990] Verse 10 says, "That I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being conformed to his death." Paul is saying, "When I suffer for the cause of Christ I don't suffer alone.
[time=3002] I suffer in the intimate fellowship of Christ who suffered for me, who knows all about suffering, and so he can be a great friend to me.
[time=3010] We can be communing together in the hardship and the ruin of our suffering together,
[time=3016] and I'm not doing it alone, I'm doing it with Christ."
[time=3022] And then verse 11 gives us the fifth.
[time=3025] It talks about in order that I may gain to the resurrection from the dead.
[time=3032] That was his passion from the beginning.
[time=3034] That's why all those seven religious merits that he was working so hard to attain
[time=3040] and to achieve and to put his confidence in.
[time=3042] He wanted to make sure that when he died he didn't go to hell.
[time=3045] He wanted to go to heaven.
[time=3047] When he was resurrected he wanted to go to life, not death.
[time=3051] And he's saying, "When I came to Christ I attained the resurrection from the dead.
[time=3056] In the twinkling of an eye my body would be transformed and I'll come forth from the grave and be new and know Christ and spend forever with him." So he exchanged a lifetime of hard work and religious merits and counted them but lost and said they're of no value, they can't earn religious merit with God, it's impossible.
[time=3076] It comes through faith.
[time=3082] Look at verse 9 again.
[time=3083] "Then I may be found in him not having a righteousness of my own." Those are his works.
[time=3089] But that which is through what?
[time=3091] Faith.
[time=3092] Faith in Christ.
[time=3093] The righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith.
[time=3097] It's mine to confess that my religious merit is of no value to God and to reach up with faith and receive Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[time=3109] It's as if he's saying, "I spent the first part of my life hacking through the jungle, the religious jungle and I was making great progress and I was making great strides and I was out in front of the pack and I was making my way through but then suddenly it dawned on me.
[time=3122] I was in the wrong jungle and it didn't matter how far I got in this jungle.
[time=3126] It's like he's saying I was climbing the ladder of religious success and I was moving up the rungs faster than anybody else.
[time=3135] But suddenly it dawned on me, my ladder was leaning against the wrong wall and I could climb all I wanted to and I'd never get where I wanted to go.
[time=3144] He absolutely repudiated everything he'd stood for, everything he'd lived for, everything he'd worked for in his works righteousness.
[time=3151] And he had the humility to admit he was wrong.
[time=3156] As we close this morning, come to Matthew 13 for a second.
[time=3159] Let me show it to you in the words of our Lord.
[time=3162] Matthew chapter 13 verse 44.
[time=3175] He's telling a parable here to illustrate the same truth.
[time=3178] He says the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in the field which a man found and hid.
[time=3186] So there's a man out in the field and he finds this huge treasure and as soon as he sees it he covers it back up.
[time=3192] Don't want anybody else to see it.
[time=3195] So excited that he goes and he sells everything that he has so he can do one thing with all of his life effort by the field.
[time=3206] What he's saying is everything I've earned, everything I've worked for is insignificant to the value of this one treasure.
[time=3214] And of course Christ is using the treasure to speak of himself, faith in Christ.
[time=3220] And so he sells everything to get that treasure.
[time=3224] He has another one in the following verses 45 and 46.
[time=3227] Again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant.
[time=3230] It's a businessman seeking fine pearls and this businessman on a ship sails all around the world seeking to find the best pearls of the world.
[time=3240] Well in verse 46 he comes upon one pearl of great value
[time=3246] and he went and sold all that he had and he bought it.
[time=3252] So everything I've worked for, everything I have, all that I own is of no value in comparison to this one single pearl.
[time=3262] And that's how Christ wants us to approach him.
[time=3265] He wants us to look at all the religious accomplishments of our life.
[time=3268] He wants us to look at all any works righteousness, any hope that we might have that we can earn the favor of God through works and say they're worthless. I'd sell them all.
[time=3277] In fact go so far as Paul and say they're rubbish.
[time=3281] All I want is Christ.
[time=3286] Because in Christ I have the knowledge of a true and living Savior and I have His power and I have His fellowship and I'll attain to the resurrection of the dead.
[time=3298] And it's only those who can say that about themselves that they look at their religious efforts and say they're of no value.
[time=3304] My only entrance into heaven is to the person of Christ.
[time=3307] It's only people who say that that go to heaven.
[time=3310] Everybody else is deceived and on their way to hell.
[time=3316] So as you hear this this morning you're in one of two camps.
[time=3320] You're either holding on to an old way that you might have learned from your ancestors and they prized it and they held on to it and they wouldn't trade it for anything.
[time=3333] You're holding on to works.
[time=3336] You're holding on to your own pride.
[time=3338] You're holding on to your own sense of sufficiency.
[time=3340] That when it's all said and done you'll stand before God and He'll say oh that's nice.
[time=3345] You can come into heaven.
[time=3348] And if you're there my friend you're deceived because God doesn't accept people into heaven on their own merit as you can see from the Word of God this morning.
[time=3357] Or you're in a different camp and you've said no, it's not works, it's faith.
[time=3363] It's faith in the work of Christ.
[time=3365] It's the righteousness of Jesus Christ that merits heaven for me and I accept Him as my Savior.
[time=3372] If you're in that camp you should be especially thankful that God allowed you to see the truth.
[time=3379] Let's pray together.
