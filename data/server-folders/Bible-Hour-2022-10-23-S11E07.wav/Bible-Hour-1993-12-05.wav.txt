[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=29] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=37] Thank you for joining us. Goals are important. They give us a sense of purpose and direction.
[time=44] They let us measure and evaluate our progress, and attaining them can bring a great sense of gratification.
[time=51] Do you have goals for your life? Do you have a sense of what God is trying to accomplish in and through your life?
[time=58] Well, in the text we study today, Paul gives us five characteristics of a life in pursuit of godly goals.
[time=66] Our special music today will be provided by celebration.
[time=73] Let's join celebration as they begin our service.
[time=97] Mary, did you know that your baby boy would one day walk on water? Mary, did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?
[time=114] Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you new? This child that you deliver will soon deliver you?
[time=131] Mary, did you know that your baby boy would give sight to the blind man? Mary, did you know that your baby boy would calm a storm with his hand?
[time=148] Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels try? And when you kiss your little baby, you've kissed the face of God.
[time=166] Mary, did you know? Oh, Mary, did you know?
[time=183] The blind will see, the deaf will hear, the deaf will live again, the blind will leave, the dumb will speak, the praises of the land.
[time=201] Mary, did you know that your baby boy is Lord of all creation? Mary, did you know that your baby boy will one day rule the nations?
[time=219] Did you know that your baby boy has heaven's perfect land? And the sleeping child you're holding is the great I am.
[time=245] Mary, did you know?
[time=269] Our special gift this month is the beautiful book by Jonny Ericcentata, A Christmas Longing. In it, Jonny writes a beautiful account of Christmas with all its joy and splendor.
[time=281] She's also illustrated this entire book with many full-color pictures. If you would like one of these books for yourself or for a friend, the Bible hour is offering them to you for a gift of $25 or more.
[time=293] Please write to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=300] Well, hello and welcome to the Bible hour. We're thankful that you're with us and that you'll spend this time with us as we think about the things of God.
[time=307] We're sure excited about this Christmas season and we're midway into our living Christmas tree performances.
[time=314] Our church will have about 11 of them each Christmas season and we'll see over 20,000 people come and celebrate the birth of Christ.
[time=322] And we're thankful this year we're featuring a testimony in the living Christmas tree in addition to all the wonderful music, but a testimony that speaks to the fact that our excitement isn't just over the birth of a baby some 2,000 years ago, but the presence of a resurrected living Savior, that same baby who grew and lived and died on the cross for our sins and rose again.
[time=346] The Bible tells us that when we accept Him through faith, He sends His Spirit to live inside of us and so it's true to say Christ in us, the hope of glory.
[time=356] And that means we have a vital relationship with the person of Christ on a day-to-day basis and we're featuring that in our living Christmas tree this year through a gal by the name of Julie Collins.
[time=368] And she's a dear, dear lady in our church, she and her husband Marty and they had just had a newborn babe, now I guess about a year old, her name is Molly.
[time=379] What's interesting was in the process of her pregnancy it affected her eyesight and the closer she got to delivery, the worse her eyesight became until finally at the point of delivery she was nearly blind and could see only a shadow of her little baby.
[time=397] And while that is a tragic loss, Julie is now completely blind and there is no hope of her recovering her eyesight.
[time=406] She really believes and we believe with her that it's the Lord Jesus Christ drawing her into a closer relationship with Him.
[time=413] She had prayed to Him some years ago, whatever it takes, Lord, so that I would know you better and serve you more completely.
[time=419] Please do that in my life and it's remarkable to hear her testimony of the way she senses the presence of Christ and the way He's working in her life and causing her to be a better Christian through this hardship.
[time=432] And I don't know what's happening in your life, whether there is some unexpected hardship, but I believe that if you'll look at it from a spiritual perspective and perceive the loving hand of God in your life it can be used to draw you even closer in your relationship with Him.
[time=448] Even this morning in our message we'll talk about the Apostle Paul and the one thing that he chose to do as he pursued Christ. Stay with us, won't you?
[time=478] To bring us the light, oh we manual, God has come to dwell, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night.
[time=507] Dark and world, receive your sight, oh the news to men, born in Bethlehem, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night.
[time=536] Oh holy night, shepherd to the angel sing, glory to the nearby king, death has now begun its end, the word has come to lay.
[time=562] Oh holy night, an ancient hope has come to light, oh Jesus born to die for us, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night.
[time=591] Oh holy night, oh holy night, shepherd to the angel sing, glory to the nearby king, death has now begun its end,
[time=615] the word has come to lay.
[time=623] Oh holy night, Christ has come to bring us the light, oh we manual, God has come to dwell.
[time=642] Oh holy night, holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night.
[time=669] Oh holy night.
[time=709] Oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night, oh holy night.
[time=737] God, the stable's gone, and the major that held the baby king to the door are all gone.
[time=760] But the stars still shine in the night, the stars still burn just as bright.
[time=773] The stars still need sound forever, with a holy light.
[time=791] Star, the world seems dark, till we follow the single ray of hope.
[time=808] Heaven star in the dark, here, his love is here, and it shines in our hearts like a beacon,
[time=832] strong and clear, God is here, and the stars still shine in the night, the stars still burn just as bright.
[time=851] The stars still need sound forever, the stars still need sound forever, the stars still shine in the night,
[time=869] the stars still burn just as bright.
[time=882] The stars still need sound forever, the stars still shine in the night, the stars still shine in the night,
[time=894] the stars still shine in the night.
[time=924] Well thank you celebration, it's a privilege to have you so many times on a one Sunday.
[time=935] It's just beautiful voices, thank you.
[time=938] Well let's in the time we have remaining take our Bibles and come back to Philippians chapter 3
[time=944] as we're studying this wonderful book of the Bible.
[time=949] And I'd like to begin by reading for you verses 12, 13 and 14 of chapter 3 and ask you to follow along.
[time=957] Paul speaking to the Philippians, not that I have already attained it or have already become perfect,
[time=965] but I press on in order that I may lay hold of that for which also I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[time=972] Brother and I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it, but one thing I do for getting what lies behind
[time=978] and reaching forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=986] Let's read 15 and 16 as well.
[time=989] Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, have this attitude.
[time=993] And if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that also to you.
[time=998] However, let us keep living by that standard to which we have attained.
[time=1004] Just at the first glance you get the impression that the Christian life is to be filled with passion and desire
[time=1011] and dedication for the cause of Christ.
[time=1014] The words he uses are those kinds of inflamed words, verse 12, press on, verse 12, lay hold, verse 13.
[time=1022] One thing I do, also in verse 13, reaching forward, verse 14, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=1033] Now you make some general observations immediately.
[time=1036] Number one, the Christian life is supposed to be goal centered or goal oriented, and there should be a passion and a zeal
[time=1044] and a dedication that drives us from one level to the next in our Christian experience.
[time=1050] The second impression that comes to my mind is that joy in the Christian life.
[time=1055] And as you know, this book, the book of Philippians is all about joy.
[time=1058] The word joy is used 16 times in the four chapters.
[time=1062] The theme of this book is joy.
[time=1064] That joy in the Christian life is bound up in being involved in this dedicated, passionate pursuit of goals.
[time=1073] Paul is saying to us that as human beings, we are not merely rational if we want to talk just to the mind of the Christian.
[time=1080] We might go to the book of Romans and learn the doctrine that is there.
[time=1083] We are not merely just volitional or able to choose.
[time=1088] If we want to talk to our volitions or choices or our will, we might go to the book of James, which over and over calls us
[time=1094] to choose consistently with our Christianity.
[time=1097] We are not primarily relational or we might go to Ephesians or 1 Corinthians, which talks all about our relationships.
[time=1104] But this book talks to us about our emotions.
[time=1107] It helps us discover and understand the truth of our Christianity, our level of maturity or the lack thereof,
[time=1113] through the avenue of our own emotions and the pinnacle of those of being joy.
[time=1117] And so Paul is giving us a primer of joy and how it works out in the Christian life and apparently a significant aspect of knowing the true Christian joy of a Christian is being goal-oriented, goal-centered.
[time=1132] To further push his point, he puts this passage in the analogy or the metaphor of an athlete or athletic games,
[time=1139] in particular a runner.
[time=1141] And if there is anything to be said about a running race, it is a very goal-oriented endeavor.
[time=1146] There is like one thing you need to do, and that is get across the finish line before everybody else does.
[time=1151] And that, to any good runner, is a very simplistic understanding of his effort, but it's clear to him that he must focus and dedicate himself to this one notion of completing the race.
[time=1162] There is a very defined goal or objective for him.
[time=1166] So in this passage, let's look this morning, at five characteristics of a goal-oriented life.
[time=1172] Five characteristics of a goal-oriented life, and as we are approaching the end of 1993, and we are on our way to '94, I know my mind has already been turning independent of this study on my goals.
[time=1185] How did I do? How effectively have I performed? Where have I been strong? Where have I been weak?
[time=1191] As I look at '93, in fact just the other day, I sat down with some guys and said, "How do you think you know me, you know my job? How could I be more effective?" And maybe you will anticipate that same type of evaluation as you are thinking about the new year.
[time=1204] So maybe write these down, these five characteristics of a goal-oriented life and let them shape both your evaluation of '93 and what you'll set for yourself in '94.
[time=1216] Number one, the first mark or characteristic of a goal-oriented life is a divine set of goals,
[time=1224] a divine set of goals.
[time=1228] In other words, Paul is saying that my purpose in life, the one thing that I do, the goals of my life, are distinctly biblical.
[time=1237] They come right out of my relationship with God.
[time=1241] They are entirely spiritual, and though they will have physical manifestations, and though they will work themselves out in a secular society, make no mistake about it, my goals are biblical, they are spiritual, they are divine.
[time=1256] You say, "Well, what is it? Or what are they?" Look at verse 12.
[time=1259] Remember that I have already obtained it, or have already become perfect, but I press on in order that I may lay hold, he's trying to lay hold of something, he's trying to grasp something, what is it?
[time=1269] Lay hold of that for which also I was laid old of by Christ Jesus.
[time=1274] In other words, he's saying, "Whatever it is that caused God to take a hold of my life, whatever his goals were for me in my life, as he took a hold of it in salvation and for Paul on the Damascus road, I have discerned those purposes and I have now also taken hold of them too.
[time=1290] God's purposes originally in my life have now become my goals, and his goals for me and my goals for me are now one and the same." You can also understand them as heavenly or spiritual or divine goals in verse 14.
[time=1304] I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God, excuse me in Christ Jesus, but these are still somewhat vague, aren't they?
[time=1312] I mean, they're sort of general. You don't need to turn there, but let me remind you. Let me remind you of why God took a hold of your life, why God took a hold of my life. In Romans chapter 8, it very clearly says,
[time=1327] "For whom he foreknew," that's his taking a hold of you in eternity past, entering into a love relationship with you before you even existed, "for whom he foreknew, he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son." We call that becoming like Christ or Christ's likeness.
[time=1345] That is the one simple, profound, underlying goal that God had in redeeming us and that we need to take hold of also in our own lives.
[time=1354] As we anticipate '94, as we evaluate '93, the question is, "Did I cooperate with God by assuming his goal for my life of me becoming more like the person of Jesus Christ?" Now, unless you think that's an introverted, self-interested kind of introspection, come back for just a moment, the Philippians 1, and look what it did in his life.
[time=1375] He is saying not just that I want to become like Christ, which means possibly in some people's mind, I'm a happier me or I'm a holier me or I'm a better adjusted me as if it began and ended with me.
[time=1388] Remember now, he's in prison and he is saying even though my circumstances are that I find myself in prison, because the one thing that I do is I try to become like Christ and therefore I am concerned about the cause of Christ.
[time=1401] Look at verse 12, I want you to know, brother, in my circumstances, have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel.
[time=1407] My goals are being wonderfully advanced now that I'm in prison, because my goal is to become like Christ and obviously then to care about the cause of Christ more than any other cause, more than my own cause, more than any other thing that could possibly exist.
[time=1423] And so by being in prison, though my circumstances are falling apart, I'm thrilled because my goals are being accomplished.
[time=1429] I'm becoming more like Christ and his gospel is progressing.
[time=1433] As you remember, the Praetorian Guard are hearing the gospel, they represent the epicenter of power in the known world at that time.
[time=1441] He goes on, what about my relationships?
[time=1444] And you remember that there were those he had trained up, brought to Christ, brought into the ministry, taught the preach, who were now preaching, not for the cause of Christ, but to try to usurp Paul's position of leadership in the church by virtue of his being in prison.
[time=1456] There was a leadership vacuum and many of these guys were seeking to fill it through selfish ambition and selfish motives.
[time=1462] Does that thwart his goals?
[time=1465] Does that take his joy?
[time=1467] Absolutely not.
[time=1468] Verse 18, what then?
[time=1469] Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed.
[time=1473] And in this I rejoice, yes, and I will rejoice.
[time=1476] Again, it's clear, the goal is that I want to become like Christ.
[time=1480] And in so doing, I care about the cause of Christ.
[time=1482] And so even though dear people who have invested in turn against me in the pretense of Christianity, it doesn't deter my goals and it doesn't knock me off schedule because my cause is the cause of Christ.
[time=1494] And he's being proclaimed, and so I rejoice.
[time=1497] Again, you remember, his well-being was in question.
[time=1499] At any moment, Nero could take his life.
[time=1502] He may not live to see the next sunset.
[time=1505] But again, because his goal is Christ and the cause of Christ, it makes no difference. Look at the end of verse 20.
[time=1511] Christ shall even now, as always, be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
[time=1516] If I die, my goals are instantly completed because then I am totally like Christ.
[time=1521] It's called glorification, and I'll be like him, for I'll see him as he is.
[time=1525] If I live on, no problem.
[time=1527] I'm going to continue to be transformed into Christ's likeness, and I'm going to continue to propagate the gospel.
[time=1532] So in either event, it matters not to me.
[time=1536] Come back to Philippians 3, and let me try to make this really practical.
[time=1540] What I mean to say is, excuse me, the only goal worth having in your life
[time=1547] is the goal to become like Christ and propagate the cause of Christ.
[time=1551] That's it. If you don't have that, you don't have anything.
[time=1555] Your life is meaningless.
[time=1557] Think with me about Robert Ballad, remember that name?
[time=1561] September 1, 1985, 350 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.
[time=1567] He is using all the latest technological stuff that is known to man to look down into the ocean some two miles, and what does he find?
[time=1575] The Titanic.
[time=1577] And you know, it's big stuff.
[time=1579] This guy has finally found the Titanic, and he says this about his life accomplishment, I quote.
[time=1585] My first direct view of the Titanic lasted less than two minutes, but the stark sight of her immense black hall towering above the ocean floor will remain forever engraved in my memory.
[time=1597] He goes on.
[time=1598] My lifelong dream was to find this great ship,
[time=1605] and during the past 13 years, the quest for her has dominated my life, end quote.
[time=1611] And the world says, man, wow, what an accomplishment.
[time=1614] What a goal oriented guy.
[time=1616] I mean, for 13 years, it's obvious he's a brilliant scientist.
[time=1620] It's obvious he's a brilliant entrepreneur to raise the money to do it, and he's able to marshal all of modern technology, and with his own stamina, he finds what no one could find, and there he's got it, the Titanic.
[time=1634] Meaningless.
[time=1636] Absolutely meaningless.
[time=1639] It maybe got a minute of primetime news the first night, 30 seconds the next, and then it got written up in a few major, you know, periodicals, US news, and we'll report a few other things, and then that's it.
[time=1649] Nobody cares.
[time=1650] What did he do?
[time=1651] What did he actually do?
[time=1652] What did he spend his life energy doing for 13 years?
[time=1655] Well, I'll tell you what he did.
[time=1656] He found an old sunken ship that is absolutely worthless.
[time=1662] And in the old sunken ship, he found some old dead bodies that are also worthless, and he found some old silverware that is worthless, and he found some other stuff.
[time=1671] I mean, the whole thing adds up to zip.
[time=1674] And you say, well, come on.
[time=1677] Think of someone else.
[time=1678] Okay, Michael Jordan.
[time=1680] Now, there's a guy that accomplished his goals.
[time=1682] I mean, you got to know, from a wee little tot.
[time=1685] He committed himself to being the greatest basketball player that ever lived, and he is.
[time=1689] I mean, he just retired, and they're not only saying he's the greatest that ever lived, they're saying he's the greatest that ever will live.
[time=1694] And look at his records, and look at his bank account, and look at his worldwide fame, and his name recognition around all the world.
[time=1700] I mean, you got to know this guy accomplished his goals.
[time=1704] Meaningless.
[time=1706] Absolutely.
[time=1707] Think about it.
[time=1708] Absolutely.
[time=1709] You know what he's spent his whole life doing?
[time=1710] Taking a little round ball, and sticking it through a little round rim stuck on a pole
[time=1716] in various cities around the United States of America.
[time=1719] That's the extent of his life accomplishment.
[time=1721] That's it.
[time=1722] He did absolutely nothing.
[time=1725] You say, come on.
[time=1726] You're a little harsh.
[time=1728] Well, let me give you some perspective.
[time=1730] Do you realize that if Robert Ballad would have had at the heart of his scientific
[time=1736] entrepreneurial exploring mission to find the Titanic because of Christ?
[time=1740] If in fact he was a Christian, and if in fact he believed that was God's leading in his life to use the talent and the resources that God had given him to be this great explorer, and really the whole thing was just a charade so that he could involve himself significantly
[time=1756] with unbelievers so that in that relationship with them as they see him struggling through the trauma of trying to do a very difficult thing, they can find the nature and the person of Christ on display, and at points they even asked or he told them about Christ, and one
[time=1772] person came to Christ through the finding of the Titanic.
[time=1774] It would be one of the most significant achievements that ever happened on the face of the earth.
[time=1779] But without that one convert, without that goal, without that purpose in his heart to become Christ, it is absolutely meaningless.
[time=1787] It is temporal, it is already over by the way, nobody remembers it, it has no eternal value,
[time=1793] nobody came to Christ, nobody was spared from heaven or come to heaven, spared from hell, and as a result it is just another passing vapor that forms for a moment and then disappears.
[time=1803] Same thing is true of Michael Jordan.
[time=1806] Exact same thing is true of Michael Jordan, most famous person, Hackley, that has ever been absolutely meaningless unless he had or possibly might come to Christ, and then sets
[time=1817] this one divine goal at work in his life and says my whole life is about becoming like
[time=1823] the person of Jesus Christ, and not even for me, so that then no matter whether my circumstances are prison, whether my friends desert me, or whether my life is taken from me, in that whole possibility of scenario events that might occur in my life, the whole thing is so that Christ can be made known in meaningful ways to unbelievers and then his life has eternal significance, without it it is meaningless, absolutely pointless.
[time=1850] Let me go one step further, that is also true of your life, that is also true of your
[time=1858] life, that is not just true of Robert Ballad and Michael Jordan and anybody else who we
[time=1864] think of as a famous person who is with great dedication to accomplish significant things on an earthly human temporal level, it is also true of your life.
[time=1873] You realize if you are here today and you are a business man or a business woman, and if at the heart of your business endeavor, it is not that you will be formed and shaped and
[time=1884] molded into the person of Jesus Christ in the hopes of having other people see and come to know Christ through your valiant efforts of character to live in a God honoring way in a wicked society, then your business is absolutely meaningless.
[time=1898] And every day you get up and go to work and you do meaningless things, same is true of
[time=1904] housekeepers, same is true of your housekeepers, you women who are dedicated and professional
[time=1910] and marvelously skilled at orchestrating a home and orchestrating a life and taking care
[time=1917] of all the myriad of things that must go on to have the kind of home that really exemplifies a professional homemaker.
[time=1923] All of the effort and all of the energy is absolutely meaningless, unless underneath
[time=1929] all that is this one simple goal that you would become more like the person of Christ so that
[time=1935] your husband, your kids, your neighbors, the people you come in contact with might know Christ.
[time=1941] Short of that, fold the tent up.
[time=1945] Pointless, absolutely pointless, the same would be true of a student who goes to school
[time=1951] to get an education, to get a job.
[time=1953] I'm here to get an education.
[time=1955] Wrong.
[time=1956] You're not here to get an education.
[time=1957] You are here to grow into the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1959] Are you talking about Christian college?
[time=1960] No, I'm talking about a secular college.
[time=1962] You go to those places to be transformed into the image of Christ and through all the stuff that they throw at you, you rethink it and you re-understand it according to the word of God and you go through the hardships and the tests and the midterms and all the stuff that goes on so that you can evidence the power and the person of Christ in your own life and
[time=1980] a teacher or a classmate might ask you or might give you the opportunity to tell them about Christ.
[time=1985] That's what Paul is saying.
[time=1988] I do one thing.
[time=1992] His name is Jesus.
[time=1993] And I do the Jesus thing in me by be telling me to look like Jesus and I do the Jesus thing in every avenue of life.
[time=1998] Now you and I know that Paul didn't sit around saying, "Oh, make me like Jesus, oh, make me like Jesus." I mean he had all these churches he was worrying about and Antioch and Philippi and Berea and Thessalonica and Corinth and he was making plans for them and he was receiving information and he was writing letters and he was taking care of his own physical needs and he was getting dressed in the morning.
[time=2014] I mean he was doing all the stuff that we have to do, but he was only doing one thing.
[time=2019] He was only doing one thing, Christ, becoming like Christ in the hopes that others would
[time=2029] become like Christ too.
[time=2031] You say that's true even of us believers, you bet it is.
[time=2035] Corinthians 3 says that you can spend your whole life inside the church doing all kinds
[time=2041] of stuff that looks like ministry or that looks like a Christian lifestyle and if it's not done with a motive to glorify God and exalt Christ and to bring people to the saving knowledge of Christ, it all burns at the beam of seed, meaningless.
[time=2054] That's the Lord's way of saying meaningless.
[time=2056] He gives you a visual demonstration.
[time=2058] Put it all there.
[time=2059] He lights the fire.
[time=2060] Only the stuff that's done from your heart with a true motive to become like Christ and lead others to Christ last, everything else is up in smoke.
[time=2070] So Mark 1, our characteristic 1 of a joy-filled Christian life is having a divine goal, the
[time=2079] person of Christ.
[time=2080] Number 2, number 2 is a discerning heart.
[time=2085] All these are going to start with these, a discerning heart like in verse 12.
[time=2093] Not that I have already obtained it or have already become perfect, but I press on.
[time=2101] What do you have here, a discerning heart?
[time=2103] He can see into his own heart.
[time=2104] He can see his own failures.
[time=2106] He can see his own sin.
[time=2107] In other words, he is saying that I am constantly in the process of understanding how I fall short of my goal.
[time=2113] I not only have a divine goal, but I'm honest with myself about the fact that I don't reach it, that I haven't reached it yet.
[time=2121] That's what I love about the Bible.
[time=2122] You know what this is full of?
[time=2124] This is full of a chronicle of people's failures.
[time=2129] Think about it, Adam and Eve, you know?
[time=2131] They send against God and got thrown out of the garden of Eve.
[time=2134] They read about Cain and Abel, and we read how Cain slew Abel.
[time=2139] And they read about Moses, one of the greatest leaders of all time, and the apple of God's eye, this great, remarkable, passionate, dedicated leader of the nation of Israel.
[time=2148] He never got to see the promise land the Bible tells us because he struck the rock, failure, never gets to see the end accomplishment of that series of his life because he sinned against God.
[time=2160] We read about Samson, strongest man in the world.
[time=2163] He gets crushed into the weight of his own sin with a harlot.
[time=2166] The Bible tells us this stuff.
[time=2167] It's just so honest.
[time=2168] It's just so open.
[time=2169] It's just so vulnerable.
[time=2170] You would think that if you were writing this, if you were God, you would have a tendency to delete the failures and just kind of bring in the high points of the positive stuff, God, God gives it to us in bloody detail.
[time=2182] All the account of the great king of Israel, David, not just having adultery but then committing a murder about his great prophet Jonah, who he selected to go tell the Ninevites, and Jonah didn't even like, he hated the Ninevites and went the other way, and when God finally brought him back and he told the Ninevites, and then the Ninevites repented, then Jonah got really mad.
[time=2201] You see, the Bible is so open and so honest, it shows us the conditions of people's heart.
[time=2207] Peter said he'd never deny the Lord, and then he did.
[time=2211] The Bible shows us that.
[time=2212] The Bible revealed that to us, and here's Paul, thirty years after the Damascus road, by the way, when he writes this little note, thirty years into his salvation and he is saying, "By the way, folks, I have not obtained it." What is he saying?
[time=2227] "I'm still temptable.
[time=2228] I'm still sinful.
[time=2229] I still fall to the weaknesses of my flesh.
[time=2232] I still struggle in areas, and I wish I didn't, but I do." We don't need to turn there, but listen to him.
[time=2239] He says, "In Romans 7, for that which I am doing, I do not understand that I'm not practicing what I would like to do, but I'm doing the very thing I hate." It's pretty honest.
[time=2249] I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh, for the wishing is present in me, but the doing is not.
[time=2258] He says at the end, "Wretched man that I am who will set me free from the body of this death." Paul, through his whole life, was honest and open and vulnerable, and he admitted his sin.
[time=2271] So the joyful Christian life is not just about having a divine goal, it is about having an honest, vulnerable heart by which you assess your own spiritual condition and acknowledge openly and honestly the level to which you are failing to meet your goals.
[time=2286] The Bible shows us both in principle by commands such, statements such as verse 12, not that I have already obtained it, and it shows us through personal example, as we've noted, as we go through the whole Old Testament and the New, God in principle and by personal example is encouraging us and calling us and inviting us to real, open, honest, genuine
[time=2308] levels of communication about our sin.
[time=2314] So while I love most about the scriptures that it is honest in its portrayal of humanity, I hate most about contemporary Christianity that it is full of isolation and facade.
[time=2325] I hate the fact that Christianity in America today pushes people off into isolated little places by themselves where they have to struggle by themselves with their sin because somebody said that mature Christians don't struggle or if they do, they struggle in such a managed way that it's always under control and there's no real crisis and there's no real need for open, honest communication, there's no real need for the wounding blow of a friend who would speak strongly about your life.
[time=2352] So we keep everybody out and we're all by ourselves and it's just not like what I read in the Bible.
[time=2361] Oh sure, generally we will say to each other, I'm a sinner, we keep it very general, I'm
[time=2367] not perfect, I've got weaknesses, I'm talking about sitting down with people and talking about the ways that we are not perfect.
[time=2376] One of the guys who the Lord has raised up in America today in Christendom and who has written several books that are national bestsellers, he is a great Christian man, people flock
[time=2387] to hear him speak, he's up there with people like Chuck Swindall or John MacArthur or Billy Graham or whoever it is out there that the Lord raises up for our country.
[time=2395] He's a guy by the name of Dr. Larry Krab.
[time=2400] He has recently written a book called Finding God, which I am reading and would recommend to you.
[time=2405] In it he talks about his struggle, listen to what he says, he's reflecting back on the
[time=2411] death of his brother Bill that happened about a year and a half ago and how he had hoped that something good would come out of that death and that it would really work to perfect and strengthen him and purify his life as is often the case with trials, but listen to the honesty.
[time=2424] And he says, "As I reflect on my life today, nearly a year and a half after the crash,
[time=2431] I conclude that my prayer for maturity has not been answered as I had wished.
[time=2436] No more than my prayer for the safety of family members was answered on that terrible day in March.
[time=2443] In spite of passionate pleas for maturity, I'm still a mess.
[time=2449] If I have a new glow about me, I rarely see it and when I do think I catch a glimpse, it quickly fades away.
[time=2457] I'm still far too irritable.
[time=2459] The slightest provocation can send a wave of fury through me that delights in destroying whatever lies in its path.
[time=2465] At times I am as thin-skinned as a spoiled child if my wife Rachel criticizes something
[time=2472] I do or fails to respond to my mood supportively, a pettiness both deliciously powerful and
[time=2478] repulsively immature sometimes rises within me.
[time=2481] Have I changed? I reacted the same way a quarter of a century ago when we were first married.
[time=2489] Unholy desires still burn within me, middle age is not refining my appetites, an obvious
[time=2495] illusion to struggle with physical lust.
[time=2500] Other feelings, some good, some bad, come and go, seemingly at their own whim.
[time=2504] For no reason I sometimes plummet into a loneliness that swallows every trace of joy and weakens
[time=2510] my usual passion for people and things.
[time=2514] For years I have lived through seasons of self-hatred when I feel unwanted and unwontable.
[time=2520] This self-loathing feels like a poisoned apple.
[time=2523] What does he mean?
[time=2525] Observe me from a distance and you think me desirable.
[time=2527] Get close enough to handle me and I still look good.
[time=2529] Bite into me and you'll be harmed, perhaps destroyed.
[time=2534] These poisonous feelings severely distort my thinking, drain me of productive energy and shut me up in the perverse joys of sulking.
[time=2543] I sometimes lose the vision for what God wants me to do through my life or wants to do through my life.
[time=2549] When that happens I either panic or feel lifelessly indifferent.
[time=2553] When I panic I accept too many opportunities for ministry preferring the possibility of burnout to the risk of being shelved.
[time=2560] When apathy sets in I feel put upon by people who want to exploit my gifts but care nothing for me.
[time=2568] Am I improving or getting worse?
[time=2570] Has my fervent pursuit of God moved me along the path that leads to enjoyable fellowship with Christ or am I on the wrong path or am I standing still?
[time=2579] That's pretty honest.
[time=2582] This guy is telling you specifically about the areas of struggle and weakness in his life
[time=2591] and he's a national Christian leader.
[time=2594] I don't see this very often, do you?
[time=2596] I don't see this kind of transparency.
[time=2599] I don't see a lot of people like Paul in Philippians chapter 3 verse 12, honestly opening that I have not obtained it and then in other books of the Bible showing us specific areas where he hasn't obtained it or doing what he did with Timothy.
[time=2612] Being involved in an intimate personal relationship with Timothy where Timothy confessed some of the same problems, lust and materialism and a desire to defect out of the ministry and they have this conversation privately and then Paul writes it in an epistle and records it for all of the church at Ephesus to read and then all of us through the centuries.
[time=2628] Do you think that God is saying something to us about the importance of being able to honestly appraise our own spiritual condition in the presence of others who love us and would help us work through our issues?
[time=2639] I do.
[time=2642] You say, "Oh, that's good.
[time=2643] Are you doing that?" Yes.
[time=2646] I mean, you're our pastor.
[time=2647] Do you do that?
[time=2648] Yes, I do.
[time=2649] I try.
[time=2650] I'm scared of it as you are.
[time=2654] One of the first objectives that I had when I came here was to develop some friends where I could do this with and I have, by God's grace, we have those friends and every week
[time=2664] and at the end of some of those sessions I say to myself because they have seen me for who I am, a struggling center and areas of real unguarded weakness and I say to myself as I get in the car and drive away, I will never do that again.
[time=2677] That is the end of that kind of stuff because I am feeling so exposed and just so penetratingly
[time=2684] seen for what I am and scared to death that these people will never talk to me again.
[time=2691] At the same time, when we work through those things and I find out they will talk to me again and they still do love me and they have been praying for me and their accountability does help me change and repent and walk along my path.
[time=2701] There are other times where I say to myself, "This is what Christianity is about.
[time=2705] We can weep and we can cry together over real issues of sin in our lives and the way they negatively impact other people and they can hold us accountable and we can keep moving together." Isn't that what we got saved for?
[time=2717] Didn't he say we could know the truth?
[time=2721] Not just the truth about him but the truth about each other and hold on to each other and grow each other and let, oh my, so yeah, I try.
[time=2730] Somebody came up to me after the first service and said, "Well, I have been looking for that in our church.
[time=2733] I can't find it." As if to say, "When are you going to stop talking about us doing this stuff and help us do it?" The person to me said, "There is no small group ministry in your entire church beyond some support groups just for the people like an A.B.F.
[time=2748] So how come that's?" And I had to say, "I don't know.
[time=2751] We'll work on it," doesn't make a little accountability.
[time=2755] But I believe that's what the Bible talks about.
[time=2757] I believe that is the heart and soul of the intimacy that God redeemed us to know and to share and to enjoy and yet so many of us, and this is my pastor's heart talking.
[time=2766] So I believe so many of us in Christianity never know that, never taste it, never experience
[time=2772] it.
[time=2773] And so there's just isolation and loneliness and continued defeat.
[time=2779] So I encourage you this morning to seek that out, seek that out.
[time=2783] Number three, he reveals to us a determined attitude.
[time=2789] Take it verse 13, "Because I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet, but one thing I do for getting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead." I've already told you what I think he means by "one thing I do," I think he means in all the activity of life there is this one passion for Christ and the cause of Christ which permeates every other thing.
[time=2809] And so it's true to say it may only do one thing, but he seems to give us some help in how to do that.
[time=2815] He says, "Forgetting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead." It's kind of a two-part thing.
[time=2821] You've got to forget what's back there and you've got to reach ahead towards what's in front of you.
[time=2825] And in the analogy of a runner which this passage is cast in, that's an obvious thing.
[time=2830] You can't win a running race looking backwards, right?
[time=2834] You can't run your fastest and your hardest looking backwards.
[time=2838] If you do, you're going to slow your pace, you're going to fall down or you're going to disqualify yourself on the line violation or a lane violation.
[time=2845] You can't do that.
[time=2846] You've got to fix your eyes, you've got to run and run hard.
[time=2850] What he's saying is, "I choose to refuse to focus on things in my past which keep me
[time=2859] from running with maximum effort in the future." Now, you've got to think with me for a minute here because he's not saying that he can't remember his past and he's not saying that he didn't have hardship in his past, right?
[time=2870] You just read three verses five and six, not too many weeks ago where he can tell you all about his past, circumcise the eighth day, nation of Israel, tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew Hebrew.
[time=2878] He goes on and on and on.
[time=2879] He remembers his past.
[time=2880] He knows well about his past.
[time=2881] He knows he persecuted Christians.
[time=2883] He can remember the people he's murdered in the cause of the nation of Israel as a zealot Pharisee.
[time=2889] It's not that I've forgotten my past, it's not that I can't remember my past.
[time=2895] Here's the problem that we get into in our society.
[time=2898] It's called, and this isn't a totally bad word, but it can be misused, this idea of victimization.
[time=2903] What we do in secular terms is we say to people, "Well, of course you shot that person.
[time=2909] You were victimized as a little child.
[time=2911] You were abused or you had an alcoholic father or you were raised in poverty and you had no way to get out and you had no avenues and so because of all that you did this great crime and so we understand that, we slap your hand, we give you some therapy and we go on." In other words, in our culture victimization becomes entitlement for disobedience.
[time=2930] Victimization becomes my rationalization and my justification for me continuing to live as a sinful, ungodly person because look at my past.
[time=2939] That's not what Paul chose to do.
[time=2940] Now I could hear him saying that, I could hear him say, "What do you think of course?
[time=2944] Of course." I killed Christians.
[time=2946] I was raised as a Jew, I was circumcised the eighth day, and then my parents just told me that I'd be nobody if I wasn't a Pharisee and so I was just abused by that whole process and I could see nothing but the Pharisee way.
[time=2960] I killed people and then I can remember those people I killed so now that I'm saved, you can't expect me to live for Christ.
[time=2966] I've got too much baggage in my past.
[time=2968] You could hear him saying that.
[time=2969] Couldn't you hear him leaning on the faults and the sins of his past as an excuse to live productively in the future?
[time=2977] He doesn't do that.
[time=2978] He means by saying I forget what lies behind is he says I choose to interpret all the junk
[time=2984] in my past and many of it was bad in ways that bring me to an ever devoted level of love and commitment to the cause of Christ because Christ forgave it all.
[time=2992] You understand what I'm saying?
[time=2995] Every time he thinks about his past, every time he thinks about how hard he was or that he was a murderer or that he was locked up in legalism and that he loathed huge bondages of legalism onto other people who were still suffering under that same bondage that he put on them as he was a leader of the nation of Israel, he thinks about the joy of being forgiven of it and so the desire to tell others about it.
[time=3016] That's the issue.
[time=3017] It's not a problem to look in your past.
[time=3018] It's a problem to look in your past with a way or a view or a mentality of being immobilized in the present and in the future and Paul just categorically denies that.
[time=3026] He rejects it.
[time=3030] The person who looms largest in my mind right now with this kind of an ocean is a gal by the name of Gail Bird.
[time=3036] She was my secretary at the Masters College for six years and just faithfully served me.
[time=3041] I got a phone call from her just the other day.
[time=3043] She's now in Russia as a missionary, only been there four or five months, been having a tough go of it.
[time=3048] The big carton of clothing that she had sent over, got way late and so she's been in there cold winters without her proper clothing and it's uncertain and it's hard and difficult but I got word that she had had an accident so I called her the other day.
[time=3063] At seven thirty in the morning her time and I hear this really cheerful voice Gail Bird saying hello.
[time=3069] What happened was she was up in the mountains ministering to some people with the gospel and she was coming into the lodge and she stepped on some ice and her feet went out from underneath her and she landed right on her face and broke her nose and they think she has a concussion and swelling all the way around her eyes and she can't even use her glasses because it's too painful to set them there so she can't read and then of course she has no confidence in the medical field there and she can't understand the doctors and she doesn't know if they've properly diagnosed her and she doesn't know that she doesn't have a concussion that might later have some real negative.
[time=3102] All the questions that fill her mind and we just sat there and talked through all those things and she felt them deeply and it hurt her and she was confused and lonely and which things were different.
[time=3111] She wasn't in denial is what I'm trying to say but you know where her last kind of sentence was of that part of the conversation she said but you know what bothers me the most Russell is I just now have to sit in my apartment and I can't do anything for anybody.
[time=3127] I can't I can't I can't be about my ministry I can't be telling people about Christ.
[time=3131] Well let me tell you a little bit more about Gayle Bird she was raised in near poverty
[time=3137] levels as a child with an alcoholic father and all the problems that go with that and
[time=3143] then she found her way to a very very negative legalistic controlling Christian college which messed her mind up on legalism and what it means to really be a Christian and then she married an outstanding student in that school who said he was going to be a preacher and so he went on to go through seminary and begin to preach and 18 years into their marriage she finds out in the entire time he's been involved in several different affairs actually she didn't find out at the 18th year she found out about year 5 but forgave him he got into another one forgave him again about year 12 until finally at the 18th year he just flat out divorced her.
[time=3176] But you talk to me about somebody who has a reason to allow their past to justify a lack
[time=3183] of love and the cause of Christ and taking hold of that for which they were taken hold of an all point to Gayle Bird and all I see in this woman though she hurts and though it's hard and though she wishes her life would have been different she absolutely refuses
[time=3198] to interpret that data in ways that immobilize her for the cause of Christ and instead she finds in it a constant renewal of her love for Christ his forgiveness his ability to make it all right in heaven and so in the interim she just wants to serve.
[time=3216] Old testimony well for lack of time I just want to read you these next two points and we'll close.
[time=3223] Number four the fourth mark of a goal oriented person is a dependent spirit a dependent spirit
[time=3229] look at verse 15 it says there let us therefore as many as are perfect that's kind of a play on words because he's already said he isn't perfect I won't take time to explain that.
[time=3239] Let us therefore as many as are perfect have this attitude what attitude an attitude that seeks Christ as the goal of life and attitude that is humble in their appraisal of themselves an attitude that looks at the past with a view to enhancing their future if you don't have that attitude if you're not tracking with this passage here's what he says God will reveal that also to you see it there at the universe 15 God will reveal that to you.
[time=3264] I like this you get real goal oriented you get real task oriented you're going to begin to think that you're the guy that's going to do it all and what he is saying is it's not that way you can try your best and you can get off track and God is so intimately and lovingly involved in your life that he will sense your attitudes he'll know the condition of your heart and he'll work strategically in your world to refine the attitude.
[time=3285] I wish I could say more about it number five is a discipline life a discipline life and
[time=3293] look at that in verse 16 however it says let us keep living by that same standard to
[time=3299] which we have attained however means I just let me throw one closing thought in he's saying
[time=3305] before I close this paragraph one more thing let me just say this it takes time you got
[time=3311] to have a disciplined life you got to have a long term look this doesn't happen overnight
[time=3317] just keep living by the same standard stay faithful through time over time through the
[time=3325] years maintain your standard you already know in the advance you're not going to be perfect
[time=3331] by the time you die anyway it's the climbing that matters it's keeping on with keeping on that keeps you fresh and vibrant and full the joyful Christian life marked by one a
[time=3344] divine goal Christ and the cause of Christ two a discerning heart a brokenness and a humility
[time=3350] and a vulnerability about personal sin three a determined attitude determined to look at
[time=3356] everything in the past with a view of how it contributes to my strength in the future for a dependent spirit knowing that ultimately God will reveal and care for my spiritual growth and five a disciplined life the long haul well at the bottom of the Alps and as
[time=3374] you know many folks have died trying to climb the Alps there is at the base of one of them a little tombstone of a guy that died and fell from a precipice in his attempt to climb
[time=3385] the Alps and on his tombstone it's very simple it just says his name and then this little epitaph he died climbing he died climbing let's let's let's die climbing let's die with as
[time=3400] much passion and as much vigor and as much dedication to Christ and the cause of Christ as we see in the heart and life of Paul let's pray together well we've come to the close
