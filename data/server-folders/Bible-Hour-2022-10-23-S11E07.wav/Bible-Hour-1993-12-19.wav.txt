[time=0] We could just understand what the people around him thought about him.
[time=16] They went on to describe some of their understandings, and they presented the contemporaries of our Lord as being equally confused because they said our Lord was confusing as a teacher,
[time=27] but when he spoke he was hard to understand because he spoke in parables and pithy little statements, and he didn't understand the cultural milieu and how, excuse me, people would
[time=37] misunderstand what he thought he meant, and so they left you as a reader with the very
[time=43] clear impression that Christ didn't know who he was, and even his own contemporaries who heard him preach and teach and saw his actions and watched his life and witnessed the whole thing, also were equally confused.
[time=70] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=78] Thank you for joining us.
[time=79] Who was Jesus?
[time=81] My tenorate preacher, healer, gifted teacher, pretender, troublemaker.
[time=86] One thing is for sure, contemporary theologians and scholars want to depict him as nothing more than one of history's most intriguing figures.
[time=94] They claim Jesus might not even have been certain of his own identity.
[time=98] They also suggest that those people in Galilee who knew him heard his teaching and even saw his wondrous works were also confused about his identity because they say he was unclear
[time=109] and vague in his teaching style.
[time=111] But should we accept what they say, stay with us today as Pastor Moore explores God's word to answer the question, who was Jesus?
[time=120] Our special music today will be provided by Crazed Kids, one of our children's choirs.
[time=129] And by Brian Losen.
[time=134] Join Crazed Kids as they begin our service.
[time=164] So come and ask Him in your heart, come now with your hand, come now before Him.
[time=179] This baby Jesus, or for all men, you will find Him in an everlasting prayer.
[time=191] So come and ask Him in your heart, oh come let us adore Him, oh come let us adore Him,
[time=206] come now receiving this baby Jesus, or for all men, you will find Him in an everlasting
[time=233] prayer, so come and ask Him in your heart, hallelujah, hallelujah.
[time=244] This baby Jesus, or for all men, you will find Him in an everlasting prayer.
[time=255] So come and ask Him in your heart.
[time=280] We want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
[time=281] We trust you have had a great year and that you are enjoying the holiday season.
[time=286] Our family has certainly gone through a number of changes in the last 12 months and we are always excited at this time to share with you some of those changes.
[time=293] Our eldest daughter Randy has just had her 12th birthday not too long ago.
[time=297] She is in junior high and excited about her life at school.
[time=301] She is involved in a lot of the athletics there, played volleyball, is now involved in basketball and also a cheerleader and she is excited about what God is doing in her life.
[time=309] Our two middle daughters Nikki and Kelly are also excited about the Christmas season because they have parts in the living Christmas tree and so they are thrilled each day to get ready for the living Christmas tree performances, get all dressed up and play their part as the gospel goes forth to the many thousands of people who come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=329] Our youngest daughter Whitney just recently had her fourth birthday and she has got new responsibilities in the home because our son Bobby has arrived and she is kind of number one mom when all the other girls are at school.
[time=342] And then of course we are thankful for our son, he kind of completes our family for us and some in our church had suggested that we call him Noah, Noah Moore as if to say
[time=352] we had enough kids and that is true we have I think now had enough but we chose to name him after my father Robert Imore and so little Bobby is a tremendous addition.
[time=362] And then of course I am always overwhelmed with thankfulness in my heart for my wife Heidi who manages our household of seven and somehow manages to keep up with my busy schedule and the needs of our church.
[time=374] And so we are moving along in the Lord we are thankful for His goodness to us and we trust that you and your family are enjoying the grace of God that you are reflecting upon the gift of His Son this season that you too are thankful for the many wonderful things that is going on in your life.
[time=388] God bless you and Merry Christmas.
[time=392] I love to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ my King to take you for His special gift of
[time=412] love.
[time=413] The greatest gift God gave to me was the gift of His own son.
[time=418] Now that's what Christmas means to me.
[time=424] Christ wants to Jesus, He is the life He lives today.
[time=432] Christ wants to Jesus, He is the truth of life He is the way.
[time=440] Christ wants to Jesus, our love to shout and sing.
[time=451] Jesus is to my King at Christmas time and all year round singing praises to my King.
[time=464] Now some kids just don't really know what Christmas is about.
[time=474] They think it's only toys and Christmas trees.
[time=482] Jesus came to give His life His greatest gift to all.
[time=489] Now that's what Christmas means to me.
[time=496] Christ wants to Jesus, He is the life He lives today.
[time=503] Christ wants to Jesus, He is the truth of life He is the way.
[time=510] Christ wants to Jesus, our love to shout and sing.
[time=517] At Christmas time and all year round singing praises to my King at Christmas time and all
[time=527] year round singing praises to my King.
[time=539] Our special gift this month is the beautiful book by Johnny Eric Zintata, a Christmas longing.
[time=546] When it Johnny writes a beautiful account of Christmas with all its joy and splendor.
[time=551] She's also illustrated this entire book with many full color pictures.
[time=555] If you would like one of these books for yourself or for a friend, the Bible hour is offering them to you for a gift of $25 or more.
[time=563] He's right to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=575] They're old familiar carols play and wild and sweet the words repeat of peace on earth
[time=594] good will to man, do you hear what I hear?
[time=604] Said the night wind to the little lamb, do you see what I see?
[time=616] Way up in the sky, little lamb, do you see what I see?
[time=626] A star, a star dancing in the night, where the tail as big as a kite, where the tail as
[time=638] big as a kite.
[time=644] Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear?
[time=655] Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear?
[time=664] A song, a song high above the trees, where the voice has big as the sea, where the voice
[time=676] has big as the sea.
[time=682] Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king, do you know what I know?
[time=691] A child, a child, chivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold.
[time=710] Said the king to the people everywhere, listen to what I say, pray for peace, people everywhere,
[time=738] listen to what I say, the child, the child, sleeping in the night, He will bring us goodness
[time=756] and light.
[time=782] Thank you Brian, beautifully done.
[time=787] Well I come to the pulpit this morning armed with three periodicals nationally recognized,
[time=795] all of which were published December 20th and I believe there's a connection in them somewhere.
[time=800] The first is People Weekly or People Magazine on the cover, it talks about little poly class
[time=807] the title Taken in the Night and you may have read this, I'm sure you've heard about it, this lovely young 12 year old girl in her own home, her mother and her sister sleeping in the room next door, a few of her friends over for a sleepover and what her was her life long fear that she would be taken by the boogie man was a reality and she was taken
[time=828] that the girls were, those left behind were tied up and she was taken off into the darkness
[time=834] and eventually killed and I guess this article by itself is horrible but when you recognize
[time=842] it represents a trend in our culture it becomes even more devastating that the young people
[time=848] in our country are being abused at a rate they never have been in the past, they are falling
[time=854] into the hands of people who hurt them and who lead them to the use of drugs and academically they struggle and they fall into gangs and teen pregnancies are on the rise and child
[time=865] abuses on the rise and as I've told you in days past teen suicide is higher than it's ever been by three times in the last 30 years.
[time=877] The next article also December 20th or the next magazine cover reports by time a picture of a Ruger, 9 millimeter, enough it explains the massacre on a suburban New York train escalates
[time=889] the war over handguns and it tells the horrible story of Colin Ferguson, how he brandished
[time=896] this weapon and shot 23 people killed six, unfortunately he's not alone, six such massacres
[time=904] and 15 days in the month of December have occurred, one article reported six commuters killed in a New York train, four pizza parlor workers slain in a Denver suburb by a man police say as a former employee, two shoppers gunned down in Oklahoma, the gun man commits suicide, a police officer and three unemployment workers killed in California, police shot the
[time=925] gunman, in separate work related shootings on Thursday a geologist shot and killed his brother and another man before committing suicide in Boise, Idaho and in Michigan a teacher involved in a union grievance was charged with slaying the school superintendent in wounding the principal and another teacher, all six of those incidents in the last 15 days or in
[time=947] a 15 day period in the month of December, we recognize that this cover only talks to
[time=954] us about a level of violence that's going on in our culture that is unprecedented, there seems to be no boundary to the kinds of violence that will tolerate or allow to occur even in Fort Wayne this weekend, the fifth car jacking this year, the corner of Roodasol and South
[time=970] Anthony, a man sitting there in a stoplight minding his own business, somebody jumps in the passenger side, points a gun at him and says get out. Also this weekend an 84 year
[time=979] old woman who is a part of our, who was a part of our super 60s ministry here regularly on Fridays enjoying the singing and the fellowship and the food and intruder broke into her home this weekend and for fear she died, overcome by the fact that a, somebody would break right
[time=997] into her home when she was there, her age, the situation overcame her and she's dead.
[time=1004] And then there is this third magazine also published December 20th, 1993, US News and
[time=1010] World Report. The question is who was Jesus and instead of a picture of a little girl
[time=1018] who was abducted and instead of a weapon that was used to kill six people, there is a picture of what they assume Jesus might have looked like, no one of course knows. And the question is who is Jesus and I seem to believe that these covers are related in no strange way.
[time=1034] The problem is nobody knows anymore and nobody cares. Seems as if nobody in America knows
[time=1042] anymore who Jesus was and nobody cares and if you were to read this article who was Jesus you would find that it offers no help whatsoever. In fact it contributes to the problem because
[time=1053] it presents the Lord as an enigma and enigma is something in fact they use that word in
[time=1059] the article which is unknown, it's intangible, it's impossible to really understand and they
[time=1065] go on a report that Jesus was and enigma and he remains throughout history as one of the most intriguing figures but still unknown and unknowable. In the article they cite a number
[time=1076] of what they allege to be great scholars and theologians and typically from very liberal
[time=1082] institutions around the country and all of these men are adding their voice, the voices of authority to the notion that we can't really know Christ, we can't really understand who he was, what he stood for, what his message was about. In fact they go so far as to say
[time=1098] they're not even sure Christ knew who he was and what Christ's mission was. They say that
[time=1105] he typically would refrain from declaring his own deity and it may have been later in his own life until he finally figured out that he was the Messiah but even then the word Messiah they say had so many different meanings in that culture that we can't even be sure which meaning he had for himself, whether he was a political liberator, a helper of the poor, a great teacher, what did it mean in his mind to be the Messiah so they even proposed
[time=1131] a notion that he was confused about his own identity and his own mission. Having said
[time=1137] that they then say we would be best to understand his identity by trying to comprehend what his contemporaries thought about him and they say that his contemporaries were uncertain
[time=1147] because he wasn't very clear in his message because he was known to use parables and use
[time=1154] pithy little statements and even in those statements he would misunderstand the meaning of his words in the cultural milieu of the day and so he left his own audiences confused
[time=1164] as to his message and to his identity. The end of the article says well I guess we'll
[time=1170] just have to assume he is the unknown, unknowable Messiah and that he doesn't even have a name
[time=1177] because the name that he chose for himself, Messiah, seemed to have been so misunderstood in its own day. I'll tell you what, I guess I'm wishing that little Molly Glass didn't
[time=1193] have to be on the cover and all that she represents, all the hundreds of thousands of young people that are being abused on a weekly basis in our country and I'm sorry for the picture
[time=1205] of a Ruger and its representation of a very violent and lost society that is resorted to
[time=1211] killing itself and I also, I guess I'm sorry for this news article, U.S. News and World
[time=1218] Report about Christ because it only continues to propagate the problem. It only seems to confuse the populous words and I guess there is a television show tonight that corresponds
[time=1229] was co-produced by U.S. News and World Report and so it will take this confusing message of Christ on the air and so in a time when we desperately need clarity about the person
[time=1239] of Christ the best we get from the media is a further statement of confusion about who he is and what he can do. So this morning I thought we might spend a little time on the
[time=1250] notion of was Christ clear in his claim to be God and did his contemporaries understand
[time=1257] what he was saying? Was Christ clear when he claimed to be God and did his contemporaries
[time=1265] understand him? We might begin by turning to John chapter 8 and I'm going to cite a number
[time=1271] of different passages this morning. We won't work out of any one particular text and I may reference as many as 25 or 50 different verses that I'll either read or comment on.
[time=1280] At times I'll ask you to turn to a few of them and when I do I suggest you turn there so you can see with your own eyes the truth of God's Word. John chapter 8, the first statement
[time=1292] I want to make this morning is that Jesus claimed to be God. Jesus claimed to be God
[time=1298] in no uncertain terms and he was perfectly understood when he said it. In John chapter 8 verses 57 and following you find the Lord and the company of some men who understood
[time=1309] the Old Testament. They hadn't just made a brief reading of it. They had devoted their lives to the study of the Old Testament and they understood all about the history of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and on through the line. They prided themselves and their understanding of the knowledge of the Old Testament. And somewhat of a dispute arose.
[time=1329] In verse 56 the Lord says, "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it
[time=1336] and was glad." Verse 57, "The Jews therefore said to him, 'You are not yet 50 years old
[time=1343] and have you seen Abraham?'" You see they didn't understand what the Lord was saying.
[time=1349] I mean they were questioning what in the world are you trying to assert here? You're not
[time=1355] yet 50 years old which was generous. At this time the Lord may have been 31 or 32 years of age and they're supposing how could a man who is only 32 years of age have known
[time=1365] someone who predated him by 1500 to 2000 years? How in the world could that have occurred?
[time=1373] What are you trying to say? And they are almost mocking him in their question and Jesus answers them in verse 58. Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly I say to you before Abraham was born
[time=1385] I am." Now when you and I hear that we think well that's bad English to say I am. What
[time=1392] does that mean? I am. It is a way to establish the Lord's absolute eternal existence. When
[time=1399] he says I am, he is saying there never was a time when I wasn't. In any time you can think of past, present or future I am in the present being or status of existing. I always
[time=1410] have been, I am and I always will be. There is a constant continuity of my existence. I've never been out of existence. And so of course I was before Abraham was born. Beyond that I'll tell you before time began I existed. Now still that may not be as clear to you
[time=1426] and me as it was to them. Having studied the Old Testament these people knew full and well that the only person who ever said I am was the true and living God. This was the statement
[time=1436] of Yahweh in the Old Testament. The creator of the heavens and the earth who made everything that is and created everything that ever will be. It was that Old Testament Yahweh, the true and living God who these men worshiped as God. Over and over and over and over in the Old
[time=1452] Testament Yahweh would say I am, I am, I am. Remember Moses? Who shall I say has sent
[time=1460] me? Moses asked Yahweh when he was about to embark on his mission to the Pharaoh and God said just say I am sent you. The one who has always been, the one who will never not
[time=1471] be, the one who has absolute eternal self-sustaining existence. God. And they understood it. You
[time=1480] say how do you know they understood it? Well look at verse 59. Therefore they picked up
[time=1486] stones to throw at him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple. They picked up
[time=1493] stones because that is what you did to someone who blasphemed God. Anybody who would claim
[time=1499] to be God would be in the category of blasphemy and what you did to a blasphemer was you picked up stones and you brutally killed them with those stones. That also was a part of the Old Testament law. These men not only knew the existence of God to be expressed through the phrase I am, they also knew the consequence of blasphemy to have been stoning, death by
[time=1517] stoning. There was no confusion in their mind what he was saying. In fact had he said it any other way he would have been less clear to them. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[time=1527] He knew who they were. He knew what they knew. He knew what they had studied. He knew the most powerful way to declare to them his own deity was to say that before Abraham was born
[time=1537] I am. There was a skillful and masterfully chosen set of words to bring to them in neon
[time=1545] signs the reality that he is saying I am the true and living God. The one you have worshiped
[time=1551] in the Old Testament, Yahweh, I take the same identity. What happens again? Matthew 26.
[time=1560] Come with me there. In the last several chapters of the book of Matthew we find the various trials of our Lord that led to his crucifixion and he has brought from one mock trial to
[time=1571] another. Matthew 26. In verse 57 he is before Caiaphas the high priest in one of these trials.
[time=1593] Now Caiaphas, like the group he was speaking to in John, is a man who has studied the Old
[time=1599] Testament and has distinguished himself as a preeminent intellectual and student so that he could hold the position of high priest. Also within there in verse 57 are the scribes and the elders. They were all gathered together. This is a group of very intelligent well studied men versed in the Old Testament. Verse 58 a little footnote about Peter. Peter also was following him in a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and entered in sat now with the officers to see the outcome. 59. Now the chief priests and the whole counsel
[time=1628] kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus in order that they might put him to death. They did not find even though they brought many false witnesses to come forward.
[time=1639] In other words they could find nothing to charge him with and so they brought false witnesses into the courtroom and even those were of no avail because they were false witnesses and they couldn't substantiate their claims. The end of verse 60, but later on two came forward
[time=1655] and said this man stated I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three
[time=1661] days. Now that's a claim to deity because only God could tear down the temple in three
[time=1669] days. They didn't have the kind of equipment and technology that we have today, let alone dynamite. How would a man, how would a mere man tear down a huge temple in three days
[time=1679] and then go beyond that and rebuild it? All in the space of three days. Verse 62, the
[time=1686] high priest stood up and said to him do you make no answer? In other words he's saying these guys are accusing you of proclaiming yourself divine. Do you make no answer? What
[time=1696] is it that these men are testifying against you? Verse 63, but Jesus kept silent and the
[time=1702] high priest said to him I adjure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are
[time=1709] the Christ the son of God. Now the question is posed to him by the high priest and all
[time=1715] who were in the hearing of that question the scribes and the elders knew exactly what it meant to be called the son of God. Verse 64, Jesus said to him, you have said it yourself.
[time=1727] You got it. Nevertheless I tell you here after you shall see the son of man sitting at the
[time=1733] right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven. All of those are Old Testament quotes that come to us out of the Psalms and Daniel and these men again knew those scriptures
[time=1744] and knew the exact import of such a statement that the son of man sitting at the right hand
[time=1751] of power and coming on the clouds of heaven that is a statement about his authority and about his position to judge not only am I the son of God the next time you see me you will see me coming in judgment with the authority of the very God that I am. I dare say he didn't
[time=1769] avoid saying who he was. In fact he was uniquely expressing his genius in the ways that he
[time=1776] said who he was because he knew his audience he knew their information and he knew the exact buttons to push to communicate to them beyond any shadow of a doubt his deity. Verse
[time=1788] 65, did they get the point? Do you think they understood? Then the high priest tore his robes
[time=1794] saying he has blasphemed. What further do we need of witnesses behold you have now heard
[time=1801] the blasphemy. What do you think? And so he turns to the scribes and the elders who were there they answered and said he is deserving of death. So why do they say that? Well like
[time=1813] the other group in John 8 they are fully aware that when you claim to be God you have blasphemed and you deserve to die. It was the death penalty in the Old Testament the blasphemed God they knew all about it. They knew exactly what he was saying and they were prescribing the proper punishment for one who would blaspheme against God. Then they go further. Verse 67,
[time=1833] they spat in his face and beat him with their fists and others slapped him and said prophesied to us you Christ. Who is the one who hit you? Which is another indication that they knew exactly what he was saying. He was claiming deity and with deity comes omniscience and so many would slap him in succession. He wouldn't see all of them and so they would test his deity by saying tell us which one hit you. Make no mistake about it. They knew exactly
[time=1860] who he said he was and that was the basis of their reaction against him. In John 14 he
[time=1868] said I am the way, the truth and the life, the definite articles in front of each one
[time=1876] I am the only way, I am the only truth, I am the only life and no man comes to the Father
[time=1884] but through me. That's pretty clear. That's pretty definitive. How a person could hear
[time=1890] that and misunderstand what he is saying goes beyond my ability to understand. You
[time=1896] almost have to say that language makes no sense. I mean to say that Jesus wasn't clear you almost have to say that language makes no sense and we can't even rely on the vehicle of communication anymore because that's pretty clean. John 11 he said I am the resurrection
[time=1911] and the life. He who believes in me shall live even if he dies and everyone who lives
[time=1918] and believes in me shall never die. The message is clear. The message is indisputable. He
[time=1926] claimed over and over and over and over again to be God and he was over and over and over again completely and perfectly understood by his contemporaries. Now certainly along the
[time=1937] way there may have been misunderstandings. Along the way there may have been son who queried at his comments and who didn't fully understand everything he was saying but the vast majority of people who heard him and is particularly the religious leaders of his day got it in bold, clear, tetna color. I am the true and living God. In Matthew 16, 16 Jesus asked Peter
[time=1961] who do you think that I am? And Peter said thou art the Christ the son of the living God
[time=1967] and the Lord affirmed him in that statement. Number two, number two you would expect that
[time=1974] if God were to come in the form of human flesh he would live an absolutely perfect sinless life because that's what it's all about right? The reason for the lamb of God, the reason for the need of a Savior, the reason for somebody to come and save us from our sins is because we're sinful and a sinful person can't die for sinful people and have any effect in the eyes of a holy and the righteous God. So if in fact he is the true and living God then what we would expect to find is a sinless life and that is exactly what we find. And he claims such. In John 8, 24 he said I always do the things that are pleasing to my father.
[time=2010] Now think about that. I mean what a wonderful thing to be able to say. All of my life in every circumstance, in every relationship, in every situation I always do the things that
[time=2023] are pleasing to my father. Both in heart, in mind, in spirit we read in the Gospels the
[time=2029] account of how he treated his family, how he treated his disciples, how he treated the multitudes, how he treated the false religious leaders, how he handled Satan in Matthew 4, the temptation in the wilderness, in every single circumstances he was blameless. Absolutely
[time=2044] sinless. Hebrews 4 said he was tempted in all things as we are yet without sin. He experienced
[time=2051] the full blast of temptation by Satan and a world system and yet he was without sin.
[time=2058] Hebrews 7 calls him holy, innocent and undefiled. So it is as we would expect. He said he was
[time=2065] sinless and he was sinless. You say did his contemporaries understand that about him?
[time=2071] Did they know that? I mean did they figure that out? You bet. Peter, a man who lived
[time=2079] with him for three years, traveled with him everywhere he went, saw him under all the pressure cooker situations of his entire life, both publicly and privately, said in 1 Peter
[time=2091] 2 he committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth. Walked with him day in and
[time=2097] day out and said he committed no sin and then he said, nor was there any deceit found in his mouth. You know what the Bible says about your mouth? It is the gateway to your heart and if you have sin in your heart it will eventually come out of your mouth. Peter knew that. What Peter was saying is this man not only didn't commit external behaviors of sin, he never even evidenced any internal sin. Absolutely righteous and pure. John said this
[time=2120] to you and to me, if any man says he has no sin, he is a liar and the truth is not in him. Anybody who has ever lived stands up and says I am pure, I am blameless, no sin in me. John says you are a liar. The truth isn't in you. But what do you say about Christ?
[time=2136] First John 3, 5, in him there is no sin. John was well acquainted as was Peter with the notion
[time=2144] of sin because they had studied the Old Testament and they had read Genesis 1, 2, and 3 and they had seen the fall and they had seen the depravity of man and they had seen the wickedness of people. They were men very familiar with the concept of sinful human beings and yet
[time=2158] they closely scrutinized his life and came up with the absolute verdict, sinless. The
[time=2164] thief on the cross, for example, said and we indeed, justly speaking about their crucifixion,
[time=2171] but he said for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong. So in the moment of crisis even that thief who was later in paradise with God was able to say and give testimony to this man, he is blameless. We are dying for just cause. He dies in innocence. He said well those were his friends. Of course
[time=2191] maybe Peter and John and even the thief on the cross, they were benevolent to the cause of Christ. What about his enemies? Well I already showed you in the trial of Caiaphas they brought testimony after testimony, false testimony, people who were paid to come and lie about the person of Christ and they could find no grounds upon which to convict him.
[time=2210] Beyond that in John 846 there is a crowd of people in front of him and he says this, which of you convicts me of sin? Now if I were to say that this morning, we'd have quite a little party here. A lot of you know of my sin, a lot of you have seen my fear. He stands silence. Nobody says a thing. Just absolutely nobody has any to say. Pilot in
[time=2230] Matthew 27 after trying the Lord steps out to the crowd of the Jews that are below him and you remember he is washing his hands to say I am innocent of this thing and he says what evil has this man done? Referring to Christ, he'd been in the chamber, he'd examined
[time=2245] his life, he'd heard the testimony, he could find nothing and so he goes to the crowds and say what did he do? You know what they say? Crucify him. They don't say what he
[time=2256] did, he didn't do anything, they'd just cry for his death. They had every opportunity to proclaim his sin and here a whole populace of people who would have watched him grow up and seen his life experiences and seen him when he thought nobody was watching him and none of them could say anything except kill him because there was no charge to make.
[time=2274] He was holy and pure and blameless. Most interesting to me is Judas. Judas is the
[time=2281] guy who also walked in his close company for those three years and saw the inner circle and heard the inside conversations and who himself betrayed the Lord. You remember for thirty pieces and after he had done his wicked deed and the Lord had been taken from the
[time=2295] Garden of Gethsemane, he repented of his deeds in a certain sense, was sorrowful that he'd done it, went back to the place those who had bribed him and tried to give the money back.
[time=2303] They said we don't want it and we don't care about you. So he dispensed with the thirty pieces and then said this, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." Those are the words of Judas, Matthew 27.4, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." If anybody on
[time=2318] the planet would have liked to have found fault to justify his own betrayal of Christ, it would have been Judas to assuage his own sense of betraying this great and awesome man if
[time=2330] he could have found but one sin in the guy's life, I'm sure he would have articulated it, but instead he said I have sinned by betraying innocent blood. So whether you be his friend
[time=2340] or whether you be his enemy, having watched him his whole life or parts of his life from the outer circle or the inner circle, the testimony comes up absolutely spotless, sinless as you might expect, as you might expect, when God becomes human, when God takes on the form
[time=2356] of human flesh for the very purpose of redeeming men from their sinfulness and has been foretold for two thousand years as the Lamb of God without spot, you might expect him to live a sinless life, he did, he did. Well there's a third point I want to make and it has to
[time=2372] do with his work, it has to do with his works, his miraculous works because the Lord knew
[time=2379] that he was walking around telling people he was God and they maybe didn't have the benefit of being there at the birth and seeing the star lead the wise men miraculously to
[time=2389] the very location and watching the wise men fall and worship him. Many of the people would have no knowledge of the Isaiah 7 testimony that he would be born of a virgin and how would they verify that he was born of a virgin anyway? I mean how do you prove that? They wouldn't have had the benefit of that information. They wouldn't have had the opportunity to
[time=2408] see his sinless life on the inside circle, they would have been on the outside and maybe just heard rumors about him and here he is saying is God and how would he ever prove to them that he was truly the living God? What evidence could he give them? Well he
[time=2423] gave them miracles. He gave them miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle and he did it any time he wanted to do it and there was no limit to it, there was no parameters for his miracles, there was no extent to which he would go. He absolutely performed every possible miracle conceivable over and over and over again so that anybody
[time=2442] who saw him would know this man is unique. Now what did he say about his identity? He
[time=2449] said he is God and he does this? Luke 7, 22, the blind receive sight, the lame walk, the
[time=2457] lepers are cleansed, the death here, the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to him. That is the testimony of the life of Christ. Matthew 4 and the news about
[time=2466] him went into all Syria and they brought to him all who were ill taken with various diseases
[time=2472] and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics and he healed them all. This isn't one of these
[time=2479] television huckster guys that brings people in an audience and they have certain maladies that may or may not actually exist and they fall on the ground, they get up and they're healed and they walk out. The Lord Jesus Christ healed every kind of conceivable disease known to his
[time=2494] generation and in fact in his three and a half year ministry through Palestine he basically eradicated all disease, wiped it out, gone. The Lord Jesus Christ could go down to part view
[time=2506] right now and go into any ward you lead him to and heal every single person in the hospital.
[time=2513] He could clean the place out, everybody goes home well, everybody goes home totally satisfied.
[time=2518] You say what do you mean? Well let me list it to you, listen to the miracles that our Lord did.
[time=2525] Three categories, first he had power over nature, power over nature. He turned the water into wine
[time=2531] in John 2, he stilled the storm in Matthew 8, he controlled the fish in Luke 5, he multiplied food
[time=2537] in John 6, he walked on the water in Matthew 8 and he caused a fig tree to dry up by merely cursing it in Matthew 21. Disease, he healed a leper in Matthew 8, a paralytic in Matthew 9,
[time=2549] he healed the fever of Peter's mother-in-law in Mark 1, the nobleman son in John 4, a withered
[time=2555] hand in Mark 3, death and dumb in Mark 7, blindness in John 9 and 10 lepers in Luke 7,
[time=2561] absolute 17, absolute total control over any kind of disease anybody brought him. You name it,
[time=2568] he healed it. Death, Jarias daughter, he raised her from the dead in Matthew 9, he raised the widow's son in Luke 7, and you remember John 11, he brought Lazarus back to life.
[time=2580] Against the warnings of his contemporaries, they were standing outside the grave and they said,
[time=2586] don't have that tombstone rolled away, he's been in there too long, his body has begun to decay, it's going to smell, give it up. Lord said, roll that thing away, Lazarus come forth and
[time=2597] Lazarus came forth, not smelling the stench of death but totally and completely brought back to life.
[time=2606] John 20 says, many other signs therefore Jesus also performed in the presence of his disciples,
[time=2612] which are not written in this book. Not only did he do the ones we've read about, he did a whole bunch of other ones that the book couldn't contain, it would have been too long to contain all of those.
[time=2622] Come with me to Mark chapter 2, let me show you, you say, well did they understand the import of
[time=2629] his miracles? When he did all that stuff did they get the message that he was really God?
[time=2634] You bet they did. Mark chapter 2 verses 1 to 12, when he had come back to Capernaum several
[time=2643] days afterward, Mark chapter 2, it was heard that he was at home and many were gathered together so
[time=2651] that there was no longer room even near the door and he was speaking the word to them. Now that alone is a testimony to the power and the influence of the life of Christ. Verse 3, they came bringing
[time=2662] to him a paralytic carried by four men. In other words the reputation was so strong and so predominating
[time=2670] that ancient world that Christ had the power to heal that when he showed up back even there at home the place is crowded, they're beating down the doors, there's no room for anybody else and people are carrying sick people to see him. Verse 4, being unable to get to him and being unable to get
[time=2689] to him meaning the paralytic couldn't get to Christ because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and when they had dug an opening they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.
[time=2698] Now that's an interesting thing. Think about what these four men were thinking.
[time=2703] Not only will they take their time and energy to pick up a pallet of a friend and haul him to the place where Jesus was but they were so convinced that he could heal people of this particular
[time=2715] disease and really any kind of disease that getting there they couldn't get to the door so they climb on the roof and then they tear up somebody else's house. That's literally what they did. They dug
[time=2725] through the roof. Now friends you don't do that on a whim. You don't do that on a hunch. You don't
[time=2731] do that on the suspicion that Jesus might be able to heal somebody. These men were absolutely
[time=2738] totally convinced that Jesus Christ could heal people from their sicknesses so convinced that
[time=2744] they risked the social embarrassment of climbing on somebody else's house and ripping the roof open
[time=2750] and lowering their buddy to the presence of Christ. That's conviction. That's conviction.
[time=2756] Verse five. Watch what happens. Jesus interested to make the point. Jesus seeing their faith
[time=2764] said to the paralytic, "My son your sins are forgiven." What? Verse six. "But there were some
[time=2772] of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts. Why does this man speak that way?
[time=2778] He is blaspheming. Who can forgive sins but God alone?" That's the point. He's got a sick
[time=2784] man in front of him and he says your sins are forgiven and these guys are going these scribes who know the word of God they're saying, "Wait a minute. You can't say that. Only God can forgive people's sins." And of course Jesus being God knows what's in their heart. He knows what they're
[time=2799] reasoning. Look at verse eight. So this is the first miracle in the story and immediately Jesus answered in aware in his spirit that they were reasoning that within them said to them, "Why are you reasoning about these things in your heart?" I mean they're like caught cold.
[time=2814] We haven't even uttered a word yet. We're just thinking these thoughts in our heads and you already know we're thinking it. Verse nine. "Which is easier to say to the paralytic, your sins are forgiven or arise. Take up your palate and walk." What is he saying? Only God can
[time=2829] do either one of those. Only the true incarnate God can say I forgive you of her sins or
[time=2835] take up your palate and walk. Both of those are things that only God can do. So which is easier
[time=2841] is the point. Look at verse 10. "But in order that you may know that the son of man has authority
[time=2847] on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic, I say to you, rise, take up your palate and go home." And he arose immediately and took up the palate and went out on the side of everybody.
[time=2856] You don't think they understood? I mean this is the characteristic pattern of Christ, absolute total complete healing. This guy not only can stand up, a paralytic who may have never
[time=2867] walked in his life or certainly would have suffered muscle atrophy, he doesn't get healed by Christ and then have to do exercises to be able to stand up and walk out of the place. And to prove that point, he says not only stand up and pick up your palate, show people that you can bend over, lift things up and carry them out of the room, fight your way through the crowd.
[time=2882] Absolute obvious undeniable proof that complete and total instant healing has occurred.
[time=2887] You think they got the point? Look at verse 12 again, the end of the verse, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God saying we have never seen anything like this.
[time=2901] You bet they got the point. You bet they got the point and he even went so far in that particular setting to clarify that I can both say your sins are forgiven and take up your palate
[time=2912] and walk and I can tell you what you're thinking. Now if there's any way to escape,
[time=2918] the obvious conclusion that the miracles of Christ were given to prove his identity as the true and living God, it seems inescapable to me that you can't draw that conclusion. Nicodemus for example,
[time=2929] in John chapter three, Nicodemus, a leading teacher of the Jews, a man who had distinguished
[time=2935] himself and electually as a student of the Old Testament, brilliant mind, unbelievable thinker, comes to Christ in the night and says this, we know that you have come from God as a teacher.
[time=2946] He says there's no question about that. It's absolutely obvious we know you have come from God
[time=2953] as a teacher. Why does he know that? For no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.
[time=2960] The miraculous testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ, absolutely undeniable.
[time=2967] So to the question who was Jesus as our liberal friends from U.S. News and World Report would
[time=2976] love to deceive an entire populace at a time when our country needs to know more clearly than ever
[time=2982] the true identity of Jesus Christ so that we can come to him, submit ourselves to him,
[time=2989] be washed and cleansed of our sin by the Lamb who was without blemish or spot, and find in him the power and the strength to lead uniquely different lives. At a time such as this,
[time=3002] they raised great questions and say he didn't even know who he was. We've spent 20 minutes
[time=3009] looking at the record. Do you agree? I'm absolutely convinced he was completely certain of his identity.
[time=3015] He knew exactly why he had come. Others would say, well, but yeah, he might have, but they didn't know. They didn't understand his message. He was confusing. He talked in parables. He talked in pithy little statements. He didn't understand what his words meant to his culture. Do you think so? I mean, is that what we've concluded? There are just a few examples
[time=3035] I've given you we could give you more. Let me give you the words of historian Philip Schof.
[time=3042] He says this, quote, "This Jesus of Nazareth, without money and arms, conquered more millions than Alexander, Caesar, Muhammad, and Napoleon. Without science and learning, he shed more light on things human and divine than all philosophers and scholars combined.
[time=3057] Without the eloquence of schools, he spoke such words of life as were never spoken before or since and produced effects which lie beyond the reach of order or poet. Without writing a single
[time=3068] line, he has set more pins in motion and furnished themes for more sermons, orations, discussions, learned volumes, works of art and songs of praise than the whole army of great men of ancient and
[time=3079] modern times." That's true. Any student of history knows that Jesus Christ stands absolutely singular
[time=3085] in his impact on humanity. His influence alone should draw one to conclude that he was not
[time=3092] a mere human being. Some say he was just a good teacher, but good teachers don't claim to be God.
[time=3101] Some say he was merely a good example, but good examples don't mingle with prostitutes and sinners.
[time=3108] Some say he was a madman, but madmen don't speak the way he spoke. Some say he was a
[time=3116] crazed fanatic, but crazed fanatics don't draw children to themselves or attract men of intellect
[time=3122] like Paul or Luke to be their followers. Some say he was a religious phony, but phonies don't rise
[time=3129] from the dead. Some say he was only a phantom, but phantoms can't give their flesh and blood to be
[time=3136] crucified. Some say he was only a myth, but myths don't set the calendar for history.
[time=3145] Jesus has been called the ideal man, an example of love, the highest model of religion, the foremost pattern of virtue, the greatest of all men, and the finest teacher who ever lived. All of these descriptions capture elements of his character, but they all fall short of the full truth. The
[time=3160] apostle Thomas expressed it perfectly when he saw Jesus after the resurrection and exclaimed,
[time=3166] my Lord and my God. As we look at what's going on in society, some of us have to look in our own
[time=3177] hearts. Some of you who are here today and say what's going on in society is going on in my heart.
[time=3180] I find in me the principle of sin. I find in me the longing and compassion to be involved in the
[time=3188] deeds of darkness. It seems overwhelming. It seems compulsive. It seems out of my control.
[time=3194] And maybe by that you need to face the fact that you have not ever met the person of Jesus Christ in a personal and transforming way. And though having come to Christ, we can still be tempted, there is a sense of being separated from the things of the world and longing instead the things of God.
[time=3209] And my hope and my prayer is that in this Christmas season, you will not be further confused.
[time=3216] I mean, it seems to me that the incidents which mark our generation, the mass murders that occur,
[time=3223] the way children that are being treated, the things that are going on in our culture seem to stand as even a stronger apologetic to the need for Jesus Christ as our Savior. Society back in 1962,
[time=3234] when they said we will no longer pray in our schools. In a sense, our country and our society
[time=3240] publicly said we want God no more. We will have nothing to do with him anymore. And since 1962, the crime rates and the abuse rates and the suicide rates, all of those things have done nothing but escalate as we have said we will live without Christ.
[time=3253] Who was Jesus Christ? Well, he claimed to be God and he was understood to be God by those who
[time=3260] saw him. He proved he was God by living a perfect, sinless life. He further proved he was God by
[time=3266] defying all feats of nature, of health, and even of death itself, not to mention his own resurrection.
[time=3274] And he stands ready to be your Savior. He stands ready for you to acknowledge him as king,
[time=3280] as God, for you to acknowledge your own sin, for you to repent, and come to a saving knowledge of the person of Christ. Let's pray together.
[time=3315] I want to thank you for watching the Bible Hour today. I'm glad that you had an opportunity to
[time=3330] meet our pastor's family. And I want to say for my family that we want to wish you a very Merry
[time=3336] Christmas and a joyous holiday season. My oldest daughter, Lisa, is down with her husband in
[time=3343] southern Indiana. They're in a new church down there and worshiping and praising the Lord there, and we're just thankful for their ministry. My middle son, Peter, is in Chicago and Andy is a
[time=3354] freshman at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. Carol and I continue to work here at
[time=3360] Blackhawk Baptist Church. We're thankful for the ministry that we have in music and especially the living Christmas tree. It was great to see many of you come to the living Christmas tree and I hope that was a special blessing to you as you came together and listened to the music and especially
[time=3376] the story about our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, being born in a manger. And more than that as we
[time=3382] tried to portray in those concerts the fact that Christ grew up, lived here for a time, and then
[time=3388] died and rose again for our sins. That was a special message for us to let you know that you can accept
[time=3395] Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. I hope if you've never done that you might even do that
[time=3401] just today. What a perfect time of the year it would be to accept Jesus Christ into your heart.
[time=3406] Well today on the Bible Hour you heard music from Praise Kids, our kids choir 4th, 5th and 6th grade
[time=3413] and just love their music and love them and it's a great opportunity to present them to you today
[time=3419] and then the soloist with solo was from Brian Losen. The message was a Christmas message from our
[time=3425] pastor, teacher Russell Moore. As I mentioned earlier if you'd like to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior let's just pray this prayer together and you pray after me and Christ will hear your prayer and come into your heart. Dear Heavenly Father I thank you for sending your Son Jesus
[time=3442] Christ to be born and then to die on the cross for my sins. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed today and come into my heart and be my Savior. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3454] If you prayed that prayer today write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3458] When you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in
[time=3465] your spiritual walk with God. Then I want to say a quick thank you for all of you that have sent in a year-end gift. We're so thankful for your faithfulness to the work of the Bible Hour.
