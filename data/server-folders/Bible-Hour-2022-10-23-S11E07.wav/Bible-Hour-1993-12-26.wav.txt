[time=0] The time we should be happiest, the time we should be most full of joy, and most full
[time=16] of peace, and most free of anxiety and stress, would be the time when Christ, who is called
[time=22] the Prince of Peace, Isaiah 9, 6.
[time=25] In fact, it was the announcement of the angels in Luke 2, glory to God in the heavens and on earth, peace among men, the time when we should most enjoy peace, we enjoy it as a
[time=36] humanity or as a society, the very least.
[time=52] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=58] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=61] Thank you for joining us.
[time=62] The holiday season, more than any other, seems to provoke a level of stress and anxiety that
[time=68] can steal our joy and our happiness.
[time=71] That's ironic, because Christ is called the Prince of Peace.
[time=74] The angels proclaim to His birth, glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace among men.
[time=81] Psychology tells us that by making the proper self-adjustments, we can know true peace and happiness.
[time=87] Did all their solutions start and stop with the individual?
[time=91] Is there really something we can do by ourselves, for ourselves, and to ourselves to be happy?
[time=98] Well, stay tuned as Pastor Moore answers these questions in our study of God's Word today.
[time=104] Our special music today will be provided by Stephen Maria Gardner and by Jenny Clancy
[time=117] Let's join Stephen Maria as they begin our service.
[time=122] [MUSIC]
[time=128] Jesus, how we thank you that you have come today, to be born there in Bethlehem on a
[time=136] veil of hate, we know that you chose to come to take our sins away, and though we cannot
[time=145] understand, we thank you for this day, and though we cannot understand, we thank you
[time=153] for this day.
[time=156] We thank you for the way you came, humble and unknown, you've shown us how to measure
[time=163] wealth the way we'd never known.
[time=167] Gladness comes inside a man when he gives himself away, and when we give ourselves to
[time=175] you, that gladness comes to stay, and when we give ourselves to you, that gladness comes
[time=182] to stay.
[time=185] So we thank you that you loved your home to suffer here on earth, and thank you for this
[time=192] day on which we celebrate your birth.
[time=196] We know if you hadn't come we'd be lost eternally, and so we praise and honor you, especially
[time=206] on this day, and so we praise and honor you, especially on this day, and so we praise and
[time=215] honor you, especially on this day.
[time=228] Oh come, in man you will, and ransom captive ease, rise.
[time=258] That mourns in lonely exile here, until the Son of God appears.
[time=276] Rejoice, rejoice, in man you will, shall come to thee, O will, to rise.
[time=302] What child is this who laid to rest on Mary's lab is sleep, who mangeals greet with anthem
[time=327] sweet, while shepherds watch art keep me, this, this is Christ the King, whose shepherds
[time=343] God and angels sing, haste, haste to bring you, Lord, the babe, the son of Mary, who
[time=357] lay to me.
[time=374] So bring him in, says golden room, compress and king to own you, the king of king salvation
[time=393] brings, let loving hearts and throne be, this, this is Christ the King, whose shepherds
[time=409] God and angels sing, haste, haste to bring you, Lord, the babe, the son of Mary.
[time=437] Well the wise men worshiped an infant, and it's his birth that we celebrate, but certainly
[time=452] it is the risen Lord in whom we rejoice today.
[time=468] See what I see, we have been the sky and land, do you see what I see, a star, a star dancing
[time=484] in the night, with a tail as big as a kind, with a tail as big as a fire.
[time=497] Set the little lamb to the shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear, bringing through the
[time=507] sky shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear, a song, a song high above the trees, where
[time=520] the boy says big as the sea, where the boy says big as the sea.
[time=534] Set the shepherd boy to the mighty king, do you know what I know, in your past war mighty
[time=546] king, do you know what I know, the child, the child, the shivers in the comb, let us bring
[time=558] him silver and gold, let us bring him silver and gold, set the king to the people everywhere,
[time=572] listen to what I say, pray for peace people everywhere, listen to what I say, the child,
[time=586] the child sleeping in the night, he will bring us goodness and light, he will bring us goodness
[time=598] and light.
[time=618] Our special gift this month is the beautiful book by Johnny Ericcentata, A Christmas Longing.
[time=625] In it, Johnny writes a beautiful account of Christmas with all its joy and splendor.
[time=630] She's also illustrated this entire book with many full-color pictures.
[time=634] If you would like one of these books for yourself or for a friend, the Bible hour is offering them to you for a gift of twenty-five dollars or more.
[time=642] He's right to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=672] We need you Lord, we need to love your grace to seek your holy face about this world of
[time=695] life, we need you Lord, we need your majesty to lend us dignity and make us worthy all
[time=713] our way, we need to save every way to live, we need to learn from you and our way to
[time=732] love, are we need to live, we need you Lord, we need your light to save what is eternity
[time=757] in our every daily place, we need you Lord, we need to cling to you, when we have reached
[time=774] the end of all our every heart and dreams, you just can't love our pain, how we need
[time=792] you Lord, we need you Lord, we need you Lord, we need you Lord, we need you Lord, we need
[time=1409] you and pull out and then up and then down, feels better already, now here's the kicker
[time=1419] in his little article, for a boost of energy during shopping, find a quiet spot in a corner
[time=1428] of a store, right now we know this psychologist is out of touch with reality, once you've
[time=1438] found this magical quiet spot in the corner of a store, rub the area above your kidneys,
[time=1446] now we're doing it, feeling better already, lots of new energy, what's the theme, you,
[time=1457] you, you can find peace by looking to yourself, now some of these ideas may be helpful, some
[time=1464] of them may even work to a certain degree, but the premise or the theme is that there is something we can do by ourselves, for ourselves and to ourselves that will bring a sense of peace, tranquility, and joy and happiness, and as I was reading all of these
[time=1481] articles and thinking about people who were jam-packed in the malls all across America
[time=1487] and who had high expectations for wonderful intimacy at family times and gift-giving and realizing that the statistics are just so clear and overbearing that that is not what happens.
[time=1499] People instead find a greater level of stress and anxiety and depression and loneliness and emotional breakdowns at the holiday season than any other and when they turn for help they turn to secular writers who say it's all within you, you can solve your own problem.
[time=1516] And that bothers me because I don't believe that's true and as I was thinking about what we might talk about, if we were to jump right into Philippians 4 here, verses 6 and 7 and talk about the peace of God, we might go past many of you who might be visiting here, some
[time=1532] of you might not even be saved, some of you may never have even come to know Christ as your Savior and we're going to talk about how to know the peace of God once you have Him as your Savior and I thought it might go right over your head.
[time=1542] So instead, using this text kind of as a springboard, I want to give you four fundamental reasons, four fundamental reasons why we can't find peace by looking to ourselves.
[time=1555] For basic, obvious reasons that mean we will never be able to find the kind of peace we
[time=1562] were built to know and experience by looking to ourselves.
[time=1564] Then I'll ask you to just think with me this morning and see if they're not true.
[time=1570] If you have a Bible, come with me first of all to Genesis chapter 3.
[time=1575] Genesis chapter 3, the first fundamental reason is this, we are too small to find peace within
[time=1582] ourselves.
[time=1584] We are too small to find peace within ourselves.
[time=1590] Genesis chapter 3 records the fall of humanity into sin.
[time=1595] It records the mark of departure from where we left having fellowship with God and being at peace with Him and experiencing the blessings of relationship unhindered by sin.
[time=1607] God as you know, created man in his own image, put him in a place called Paradise, the Garden of Eden, where God would have regular and immediate contact and fellowship with this
[time=1618] human being, later Eve, whom he also created.
[time=1623] And God left them in that paradise and said, "Don't do one thing.
[time=1626] You can do anything you want to do except one thing.
[time=1629] Don't eat of a particular tree." And it left God's moral agents with the opportunity to choose to obey Him.
[time=1636] And as you may remember, they chose against obedience and instead both of them were took of the fruit.
[time=1642] That's background.
[time=1643] I'll look at verse 8, chapter 3.
[time=1645] After they had taken from this fruit, had sinned against God, now this, verse 8, "And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day.
[time=1655] And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden." Prior to this point, when God came walking in the garden, they would have fellowship together.
[time=1667] They would enjoy each other and the people would be sustained by God Himself.
[time=1673] Now however, since they had sinned and since they had broken their relationship with Him by virtue of their own sin, God of course being holy and can't fellowship with sinful people, and He enters the garden, they sense their own unacceptability to Him.
[time=1689] They sense they are no longer fit to be in His presence until they hide.
[time=1693] They are marked by shame and fear and hiding.
[time=1698] And the rest of the book, the book of Genesis, goes on to list the dire consequences that came to man by virtue of this first sin.
[time=1707] Where we can finish the book of Genesis, we find accounts of murder, lying, stealing, jealousy, cheating, deceit, mass murder, rape, homosexuality, hatred and lust.
[time=1718] The whole human condition just radically declines and falls apart because they are no longer
[time=1727] in fellowship with God.
[time=1728] They are hiding from God, they are shameful and they feel fear.
[time=1734] So verse in the New Testament in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 12 that describes this condition, it says, "Having no hope and without God in the world." That says it.
[time=1745] That's why you can't find peace in your own personal life by making self-adjustments.
[time=1751] Ultimate peace, because you are without hope and without God in the world.
[time=1758] And that is a miserable condition.
[time=1760] Where people have no hope, by virtue of their own sin, and they have no hope of attaining the presence of God because they can't earn or work their way to heaven, there's nothing to live for.
[time=1771] Life is one endless repetitive movement day after day after day.
[time=1775] And though there may be some comparative ups or downs, life just goes on and we are without
[time=1781] hope and without God.
[time=1782] It's very difficult to know peace.
[time=1784] You might make some superficial adjustments and some of these suggestions might help.
[time=1790] But it would be like being in your own yacht somewhere in the ocean.
[time=1796] And a horrible storm has overtaken you and fog has lowered in and you can't see anything
[time=1803] outside the window of the cabin where you direct the yacht itself.
[time=1808] And also to make matters worse, the controls of your yacht, the compass and any other radio device has been broken.
[time=1814] And so there you are, lost at sea with a limited amount of food and a limited amount
[time=1820] of water and a limited amount of fuel.
[time=1824] And you need to get connected again to your life source.
[time=1828] You need to find a way back to the harbor where you can replenish food and water and
[time=1834] fuel and maybe even get off the yacht altogether.
[time=1838] And so you're lost and you can't see around you and you have no instrumentation to assist you.
[time=1844] And somebody comes along and says now the answer to your problem is to make a few self-adjustments.
[time=1849] And so they say sit more comfortably in the captain's chair and put more directly the
[time=1856] light onto the steering wheel so you can see that better.
[time=1860] And pull on your ears a little bit so you'll release some of the tension in your jaw.
[time=1865] And you're saying well that's nice.
[time=1866] I'm slightly more comfortable now than I was before but there's a bigger problem here.
[time=1872] I'm lost at sea and until I can return to the safety of the harbor, any self-adjustments are temporary and meaningless.
[time=1881] I'd far rather be uncomfortable in my own cabin but know that my ship was headed back to port.
[time=1888] And so in some senses to take people's point of felt need, how come I can't enjoy the holidays,
[time=1896] how come I can't seem to really be free of anxiety and free of stress and get into the spirit in a deep and meaningful way and then pop psychologists come along and say well
[time=1906] do this and do that.
[time=1907] It's like telling people lost in a ship to readjust themselves in the captain's chair and not ultimately deal with the fact that the whole program is headed in the wrong direction.
[time=1918] Until people can be rightly related back to God, until people can come back to the safety of the harbor where they can be nurtured in their relationship with God, how do you know
[time=1929] peace?
[time=1930] How are you free of anxiety?
[time=1933] How are you ultimately okay?
[time=1936] You see that the point is we are too small to be self-contained and self-sustaining.
[time=1942] We were created, we are dependent, we were built to be connected to a life source.
[time=1949] Much like a ship is too small to stay indefinitely at sea.
[time=1952] It must constantly come back and be replenished.
[time=1956] We have the opinion of ourselves at times that we are self-sustaining and then we read
[time=1962] articles that reaffirm that we might be self-sustaining and so the problem gets worse but the truth is this, there is no peace until that fundamental relationship between man and his maker has
[time=1972] been restored.
[time=1973] Now that's why they call Jesus the Prince of Peace.
[time=1977] That's why those angels said glory to God in their heavens and on earth peace among men because he is the only one who can provide the restoration of that relationship between man and his maker.
[time=1989] The only way the sin thing can be resolved, the only way all of our own personal sins can ever be dealt with and so that we could be back in the presence and connected to our life source.
[time=1999] God the Father is because Christ became the Lamb of God, died for our sins, paid the price and through him we find safe passage to God.
[time=2010] That's why he's the Prince of Peace and those of us who are believers, we understand the celebration of Christmas because it is this Christ child that brought us back.
[time=2022] So the ultimate issue is not being rightly related to yourself.
[time=2027] The ultimate issue is not making personal self-adjustments, the ultimate issue is being rightly related to God, therein is the beginning of peace.
[time=2036] The only person through whom we can do that is through Christ.
[time=2043] The second reason, the second reason why we can't find peace in ourselves and through
[time=2050] ourselves and by ourselves is because we're too smart.
[time=2054] We're not only too small, we're too smart.
[time=2056] If you would come to the New Testament for a moment to the book of Romans, Romans chapter 2, Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts and then Romans.
[time=2067] This is really an intriguing verse to some, it is a curse to others, it is a blessing.
[time=2074] Some people have worked hard to wipe this capacity out that they have and it's been given to them by God.
[time=2080] Others of it are very sensitive to it and see it as a tremendous guiding light.
[time=2084] What am I talking about?
[time=2086] The conscience, the conscience, Romans 2, verse 15, it says in that they show the work
[time=2094] of the law, capital L, which means the Ten Commandments, the basic moral absolutes of God, they show the work of the law written in their hearts.
[time=2103] Their conscience is bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them.
[time=2109] That's interesting.
[time=2110] God has given us what he calls a conscience and the conscience has a written record, not by pen and paper, but written on the tablets of our heart and put it indelibly in our mind.
[time=2121] And this just little passage has written to people who have never received a copy of God's word, people who have never heard a sermon, people who have never been taught the things of God.
[time=2131] God has been so gracious as to place in the heart of every single human being from the beginning of time up to this point a conscience and it is always doing one of two things.
[time=2142] It is either accusing the individual or affirming the individual.
[time=2148] If the individual is living contrary to the law of God, if the individual is living selfishly is lying, cheating, stealing, harboring bitterness, becoming angry, all those kinds of things
[time=2158] which violate the law of God, we have within us a conscience and it constantly tells us
[time=2164] that.
[time=2165] Now he doesn't come out and say in audible words like we were watching Pinocchio yesterday.
[time=2170] Somebody gave our family that little Walt Disney movie and remember he was a little boy made of wood that the miracle of fairy became a little boy but he didn't have a conscience so we needed Jiminy Crick and he didn't always show up but when he did he's spoken that's not how our conscience works.
[time=2182] Of course that is a fairy tale of the truth of God's word inside each one of us and it
[time=2188] doesn't speak necessarily in audible words but there's a gnawing sense.
[time=2194] There's just something wrong, there's just something wrong with me, there's something wrong with this day, there's something wrong with what I said, there's something wrong with the way I feel about that person and sometimes it's hard to fully understand it and some people don't understand that that is a conscience and so they drink themselves to no longer feel it or do drugs to no longer feel it or run off and endless activity to no longer feel it but it is the warning light of the life of a human, it's much like the
[time=2223] warning lights in your car and the manufacturer of the car knows when the car is out of oil or it needs some type of service and because you may not be as sensitive to that reality
[time=2235] he gives you or gives the car a conscience and when we have gone past certain acceptable limits then a little idiot light comes up on your dashboard there and it says service soon or oil or something of that nature and only a fool says well I'm not going to believe
[time=2254] that thing, my car is running fine, by George I'm just going to keep it right on driving
[time=2260] and for some period of time that may be true but in reality that idiot light has been given
[time=2266] by the manufacturer of the car to tell you you keep going in this direction and you are going to continue to hurt the automobile it's not serviced properly, things are not right inside and so it calls the owner of the automobile to take it in and have it serviced, it's the
[time=2281] exact same thing with your conscience, your conscience is in the process of accusing you or affirming you when it says it defends you, when you do something that is right, when you are honest, when you do show integrity, when you do stand up for those who are less fortunate than you, whatever the situation may be, then something inside of you says now that was right, that was good, that was wholesome, that was healthy, I ought to do more than that, I ought to do those kinds of things, the problem is we are utterly incapable
[time=2308] of fully and completely obeying our conscience, even though it's there, even though it tells
[time=2314] us that we're wrong, by nature being too small, we can't totally control ourselves,
[time=2320] we continue to sin, we continue to violate people, but the fact is this, we will never
[time=2327] be at peace with ourselves until we are first at peace with God because until we're at peace
[time=2334] with God, his conscience will continue to hound us and plague us and speak to us and
[time=2340] force us to recognize that things are not right, it's inescapable and no amount of self-adjustment
[time=2347] techniques will ever be able to do away with it. Thirdly, thirdly, the third reason why
[time=2354] we can't find peace by looking to ourselves is that we are too social, we are too social,
[time=2362] I mean we were built for relationships, we are all about being friends with people and
[time=2369] people being friends with us, if you would come out of 1 Peter chapter 2, you'll find the five bad words of good relationships, these are the five plagues that strike every
[time=2382] relationship on the earth, these kind of capture the problem, the Bible tells us that when
[time=2392] God created us, He created us to experience our greatest levels of joy and our greatest levels of happiness through relationships with other people, and if you don't believe that, just look around you, realize for a minute that what 95% of all the songs that
[time=2406] have ever been written have been about what? Relationships, could you imagine if the great
[time=2412] composers of the world spent time putting words and lyrics to some technical type of
[time=2419] information, how to assemble a clock? Well that's so, you know right? Here's a song
[time=2426] about how to cut a tree down, that'd be big, it doesn't work, we're not interested in
[time=2433] that stuff, we gotta know some of that stuff, but the passion and the drama of life, the thing that we were built to experience and care about and pay money to, people to sing to us about and buy their CDs is because they're singing about people and about love and about the great themes of life. How many movies would sell if all of a sudden all
[time=2452] the relationships were taken out and they just became remarkably dry documentaries about how a building was constructed? You think we're going to have blockbusters? Boy, I can hardly wait, they got a new one out on the Empire State Building, how they built that thing, you're going to love it. Absolutely not, we wouldn't go, we wouldn't do it. The movies we love, the movies we care about, the movies we want to go see are the movies that put the drama of love and people and relationships up there and we jump in there with them and excite something inside of us. That's a way of proving to you in your own experience what the word of God has said, we are built for people and until our people parts, our relationships
[time=2488] are in good health there will be no peace, there will be plenty of stress and plenty of anxiety and hardship and hurt and anguish. You say so okay, well let's just get going
[time=2500] on relationships, let's just get a bunch of those, well you've already done that haven't you? Here's what they're full of, look at chapter 2 verse 1, there are five words in
[time=2510] here that describe the problems which face most relationships, the first one is malice, it just means mean-spirited hurtful behavior, you had any of that in your relationships lately
[time=2520] where people are mean to you and they hurt you and they fail to think of you and care for you. The second word is guile, it means deceit, literally it was used to describe
[time=2532] the fisherman's process of baiting the hook. When people act towards us with guile in their
[time=2538] heart or deceit they are catching us like a fisherman does fish, they hold a certain
[time=2544] thing out and the fish goes after it thinking it's dinner and suddenly he turns into dinner because it wasn't what it looked like. That happened in your relationships, people offer
[time=2554] you certain things, people suggest this relationship could look this way and be this for you and they draw you into it and in fact they had a completely different agenda, the word we might use would be manipulation or being used by someone. Those are the things that plague
[time=2569] relationships mean hurtful wicked hearts involved in deceit where they really aren't interested
[time=2576] in your benefit at all, they're benefiting themselves by you and through you and at your own expense. The next word is hypocrisy, the third word is hypocrisy and you know what that means, pretense, pretending to be something you're not. The guile is the plot of baiting
[time=2593] the hook, the hypocrisy is when you have to act it out yourself and you present yourself
[time=2600] as something to someone but you're not that, those really aren't your motives, you're looking for something in return, you're looking to have your own gain and it is the inability
[time=2610] to trust people because you can't be confident that what they're saying is what they mean.
[time=2617] Look at the fourth word, envy. Envy, we might know a little bit of that through the holiday season, it's that one person grudges another for something they have. Maybe you saw somebody get a Christmas gift or heard about somebody else's Christmas gift this season and you envied them, it isn't just that you would have enjoyed having that article of clothing or whatever it was, it's that you grudge that other person for getting it and you didn't.
[time=2641] It's a hard word and you may envy them of position or money or someone else's affection
[time=2647] or talent or gift but these are the things that seep their way into our relationships
[time=2653] and what should be a cause of joy and peace, the absence of anxiety and stress gets polluted by this stuff, the last one is slander and that just means to run somebody else down to tell another person's secrets and it seems as if you're so envious of what they have
[time=2668] that you will find some retribution against them and the best way you know how is to tell others lies about them or to tell true things that aren't appropriate so you can tear their reputation down and they may have something but you at least taken something else away from them. See, that's hard. Listen to the words of Kipling. If you can keep
[time=2687] your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you but make allowance for their doubting too, if you can wait and not
[time=2698] be tired of waiting or being lied about, don't deal in lies or being hated, don't give away to hating and yet don't look too good nor talk too wise, if you can dream and not
[time=2709] make dreams your master, if you can think and not make thought your aim, if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same, if you can bear
[time=2720] to hear the truth you spoke and twisted by names to make a trap for fools or watch the things you've given your life to broken and stoop and build them up with worn out tools.
[time=2732] If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue and walk with kings not lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you but none too much, if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance
[time=2747] run, yours is the earth and everything that's in it and which is more, you'll be a man my son.
[time=2754] The problem is the biggest word in that whole poem is the word if, right?
[time=2760] Nobody can.
[time=2761] Here are just the words of a mere man trying to extol virtue and lift up how we ought to respond to the the vicissitudes of life and the way people treat us and the temptations of life and he just in his own human effort writes out what might be virtue and we look at it and go count me out, I can't live up to the if.
[time=2779] Our relationships are plagued, we plague them, we bring the malice and the guile and hypocrisy
[time=2786] and the envy and the slander to our relationships, it's not as if we have to point the finger and say he brought it or she brought it, we bring enough of our own.
[time=2795] To make matters worse they bring their own truckload of the same and so they collide and what should be the source of joy and the source of peace and the source of any absence of anxiety and stress becomes a little hotbed for all the same.
[time=2814] How can I enjoy Christmas when Christmas is about people and the people around me hurt me and I hurt the people I'm around?
[time=2820] You see no little matter of self adjustment can correct this colossal problem that has plagued the human race since it's beginning, no little bit of self-help psychology can
[time=2833] take our relationships to a level where we can trust one another and where we can care for one another and where people can meaningfully interact with us for our benefit and we can trust them to do the same.
[time=2844] Well the fourth reason, we can't find peace in ourselves because we are too sophisticated.
[time=2856] What do I mean by that?
[time=2857] We're too sophisticated.
[time=2860] Well when we recognize that our relationship with God is broken and so that puts this kind
[time=2867] of low buzz the hum of guilt in our life and then we recognize that God turns the volume
[time=2876] up by giving us a conscience which accentuates our failures and our guilt.
[time=2880] He does that by the way because he loves us and he wants us to return to harbor.
[time=2884] He wants us to return into a position of connectedness with him.
[time=2888] When we recognize then and turn to people to satisfy our souls and satisfy our hearts but those relationships are plagued as they are.
[time=2898] There's one place left to turn and that's to the temporal, that's to things, material
[time=2904] things, temporal pursuits, personal goals, things that we think well, people may not like me and I may not like people but at least I can accomplish my goals.
[time=2912] Come with me to 2 Corinthians 4 for a minute, 2 Corinthians 4 and Paul reveals this truth
[time=2921] to us from his own life.
[time=2924] 2 Corinthians 4 verse 16 he's talking about not losing heart though his outer man is decaying,
[time=2931] he was experiencing some hardship in life and he was near death.
[time=2936] He says no my outer man is decaying yet my inner man is being renewed day by day.
[time=2940] What's the inner man?
[time=2941] That's the place of peace.
[time=2942] That's where you find either the anxiety or the absence of it, stress or the absence of it.
[time=2947] Peace or the absence?
[time=2948] The inner man.
[time=2949] That's where it happens.
[time=2950] Verse 17 how is his inner man being renewed for momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison?
[time=2960] Note the difference between the two words momentary and eternal.
[time=2965] Verse 18 while we look not at things which are seen but at the things which are not seen.
[time=2971] Well what's the big deal there?
[time=2973] Well for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal.
[time=2979] You see there's a huge difference in life you can pursue the momentary things which happen to be the things which we can see which happen to be the temporal things the physical things of this earth that happen to wear out and they by the way are not sophisticated
[time=2994] enough to satisfy our souls anything that is temporal is not enough for the human being who is created with an eternal soul and which will live forever some in the presence of God and some separated from God.
[time=3005] But when frustrated by relationship or the absence of relationship with God with our conscience continuing to plague us with our social relationships falling apart we say well then I'm going to go after the things of this world the temporal things the things that I can see the toys the money the travel the environment the pets clothing all the
[time=3024] rest of it anything position power prestige I'm going to find that stuff and that will satisfy my soul.
[time=3032] And then people run hard after it and they achieve many of those things only to find out well here I am empty again here I am empty again because it's temporal because it's
[time=3044] temporal it's of this world we were built to be satisfied by eternal things relationship with God relationship with Christ relationship with each other we by the way as I have said our eternal and so to pursue people is to pursue an eternal reality and the word of God itself those are the eternal things which we can touch pursue those which we can be in contact with pursue those to pursue anything less than that with the hope of satisfying
[time=3069] your heart is to misunderstand just how God has made you how complex Malcolm Muggaridge writes
[time=3077] in a 20th century testimony he says this when I look back on my life nowadays which I sometimes do what strikes me most forcibly about it is that what seemed at the time most significant
[time=3088] and seductive seems now most futile and absurd for instance success and all its various guys
[time=3094] is being known and being praised ostensible pleasures like acquiring money or seducing women or traveling going to and fro in the world and up and down in it like Satan explaining and experiencing whatever vanity fair has to offer in retrospect all these exercises in self gratification seem pure fantasy what Pascal called quote licking the earth what does he
[time=3116] mean licking the earth that's Pascal's way and Malcolm Muggaridge's way of saying what Paul said it's temporary it's momentary it's passing away it's temporal pursue them all
[time=3128] you like what you find yourself doing licking the earth no satisfaction no ultimate peace
[time=3140] so to a culture that is being misdirected by people who say that you can find peace within
[time=3148] yourself the word of God speaks very definitively don't be deceived you're too small the only
[time=3156] person that is able to completely satisfy himself as God that is an attribute of deity you either
[time=3163] are totally sustaining in yourself as God is autonomous independent he needs nothing he needs no one he is by himself he is alone he is transcendent he is other and he is totally
[time=3173] self satisfied in himself all the rest of us dependent creatures can only no satisfaction
[time=3180] when we are connected to him we are too small we are too smart because he loves us he puts
[time=3187] idiot lights on the dashboards of our life and they go off and they blare in our eyes constantly no matter how much we try to tell ourselves they're not blaring they blare why
[time=3197] because he wants us to humble ourselves and admit we're too small and come to him through Christ thirdly we're too social and that is the fabric of life that is what life is about
[time=3207] it's not about work it's not about toys it's not about things it's not about money it's not about travel it's not about anything other than people that's what life is and when you're outside of Christ your relationships are plagued with sin and so they can't produce what they're
[time=3220] supposed to and then third fourthly we're too sophisticated built for the eternal and only God can satisfy that if our greatest need had been information God would have sent
[time=3231] us an educator if our greatest need had been technology God would have sent us a scientist
[time=3237] if our greatest need had been money God would have sent us an economist if our greatest need had been pleasure God would have sent us an entertainer but our greatest need was
[time=3249] forgiveness so God sent us a savior it's very simple it's very simple I hope that if you're
[time=3258] here today and you've just gone through the Christmas season and if you like so many others
[time=3265] have felt the complete absence of joy and happiness instead frustration has filled your heart and stress and you're asking the question why can't I enjoy what is supposed to be the
[time=3277] happiest time of all ye all the year I suggest you think deeply on these basic principles
[time=3283] from God's Word Jesus Christ fixes all that stuff he restores relationship back to God
[time=3293] your conscience then becomes your greatest ally because you long to obey God and Christ
[time=3300] in you empowers you to do the obeying and so you can find a level of victory in obeying
[time=3306] the Word of God that you've never found before and that reaps a benefit all of its own there's a great sense of satisfaction in obeying God Jesus Christ changes relationships because
[time=3318] he changes people and though I can't promise absolute unhindered bliss in all of relationships
[time=3324] I can say that when you get into relationship with somebody else and both of you confess yourselves as sinners and dependent on God and both of you are pleased to have Christ in your heart and he is the empowering agent and you're studying the Word of God and you confess your faults one to another when you do violate each other you can experience a level of joy in relationships that is really what it's all about there are some bloody
[time=3348] noses and some skinned knees along the way but there's a fundamental level of trust that can go on between two human beings it makes life worthwhile and Jesus Christ satisfies
[time=3360] our sophistication he is that which we would pursue he becomes the passionate pursuit of life the eternal God relationship with him and it doesn't mean we don't work hard and it doesn't mean we don't have cars and homes and bank accounts and all the rest but those are seen as means of giving glory to Christ and sharing the gospel with other people so
[time=3378] that they too might know the eternal pursuit of Christ Christ is the answer Christ is the
[time=3385] only way of peace that's why he's called the prince of peace that's why the announcement glory to God in the heavens and on earth peace among men what's pretty good
