[time=0] 3500 years ago, about two million Jews stood at the edge of the Red Sea, and at a word
[time=11] from Moses, they waited in, and the sea parted, and the Bible says they crossed on dry land.
[time=23] The New Testament tells us that they did this by faith, and we admire their courage and
[time=31] their trust, and say how wonderful their faith was.
[time=37] But just a few hours after that, the Egyptian chariot drivers did the very same thing, and
[time=46] every one of them was drunk.
[time=62] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=68] Thank you for joining us.
[time=70] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. Homer Kent, professor emeritus from Grace Theological Seminary in Manonalai, Indiana.
[time=78] Dr. Kent's message today deals with our faith.
[time=82] We encourage you to locate your Bible so that you can study along with us, as we look at this important topic.
[time=88] Our special music today will feature a solo by Becky Woman.
[time=93] Let's now join our service.
[time=130] Our special guest speaker today is Dr. Homer Kent, professor emeritus from Grace Theological

[time=692] Dr. Homer Kent, professor emeritus from Grace Theological Seminary in Manonalai, Indiana
[time=700] [AMEN] Thank you, Scott.
[time=705] You might ask the question when Peter Koby gets up about 530 on Sunday morning and it's snowing out like it is in Pastor Russ's in California getting ready to do a clinic there.
[time=715] What is the first thoughts that goes through his mind?
[time=718] Well, the first thought is how is this guest speaker going to get here?
[time=723] Where is he?
[time=724] Is he in Fort Wayne?
[time=725] Is he in Warsaw?
[time=727] So that's the first thing that I did this morning.
[time=729] Just as soon as I thought I could call Becky Woman and ask her if her father and mother were in this area
[time=737] and she assured me that Dr. Kent was in Fort Wayne and I was very much relieved.
[time=741] And you are demonstrating the same thought that I had a few hours ago.
[time=747] We're delighted that as I mentioned the pastor Russ is in California and we'll be ministering at Masters College.
[time=754] You might want to pray for him this week.
[time=756] He has some fellowships there and ministers to the students and also hopefully he'll have some good fellowship
[time=762] with some of the men with whom he's worked in the past.
[time=766] Dr. Kent is a friend of ours from Warsaw, Indiana.
[time=770] He has been a faculty member at Grace Schools for since 1949.
[time=775] That's a long time of faithful service to the Lord.
[time=778] He presently is Professor Emeritus in the New Testament department there.
[time=783] He's been the president of the school for ten years.
[time=786] But perhaps most importantly he's the father of Becky Woman and the father of Gary Woman who are in our church.
[time=794] And we appreciate the cancers.
[time=796] They come over from Warsaw regularly for our special programs and for their grandchildren's programs and just have supported us.
[time=805] And we consider them friends of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=808] And in just a few minutes Dr. Kent will be speaking to us this morning.
[time=812] Before he comes though, I'd like to have his daughter Becky come and minister to us in music.
[time=817] Let's open our hearts to the message that she has in song.
[time=838] There's much confusion in the world today.
[time=845] Peace has turned to fighting and love has turned to hate.
[time=852] This is not what God intended.
[time=855] This is not what he had planned.
[time=861] Things are very different now than when we first began.
[time=869] We say God is our father.
[time=873] We say we trust in Him.
[time=876] We have left His ways for our ways and fallen into sin.
[time=884] Yet we claim to seek forgiveness and we say we'll follow Him.
[time=891] But God would not have led us to this place where we know Him.
[time=899] The only hope for the world is Jesus.
[time=907] The only hope for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=914] Oh, how we need Him, we receive Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=925] There is no other help we know than Jesus Christ, we only hope for the world.
[time=939] Oh, it's time for all of the people to call upon the Lord and pray to God Almighty to touch and heal our world.
[time=954] So if every heart would be humbled and if so, it turned to God.
[time=961] And love would ring in every heart and love would be loved.
[time=969] The only hope for the world is Jesus.
[time=976] The only hope for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=983] Oh, how we need Him, we must seek Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=994] There is no other help we know than Jesus Christ, the only hope for the world.
[time=1005] The only peace is the prince of peace moving in our hearts today.
[time=1012] And the only good news is the good news that Jesus is away.
[time=1022] The only hope for the world is Jesus.
[time=1031] The only hope for the earth is a touch from God.
[time=1038] Oh, how we need Him, we must seek Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=1049] There is no other help we know than Jesus Christ, the only hope for the world.
[time=1060] We must seek Him with all of our heart and all our soul.
[time=1076] The only hope for the world.
[time=1106] The message of that song act as a theme for our meditation this morning.
[time=1118] 3500 years ago, about 2 million Jews stood on the banks of the Red Sea and out of word from Moses, they waited in.
[time=1132] The sea parted and the Bible says they walked across as on dry land.
[time=1140] The New Testament tells us in Hebrews 1129 that it was by faith that the Red Sea waters parted.
[time=1150] We admire their courage, their trust in God and say how wonderful their faith was.
[time=1159] But a few hours after that, some Egyptian chariot drivers did the very same thing and every one of them was drowned.
[time=1172] Faith must be a complicated matter.
[time=1177] It isn't just trust, it isn't just daring, it isn't just courage for those Egyptians were just as daring as the Israelites were.
[time=1193] For centuries, Jewish people have recited this shamah, their confession of the oneness of God.
[time=1201] Here, O Israel, the Lord thy God, the Lord is one.
[time=1205] It's an expression of their faith in contrast to the pagan idolatry all around them and we commend them for their faith.
[time=1216] But the Bible says that the demons also believe that God is one and they have no doubts about it and yet every one of them is rejected by God.
[time=1231] Faith is not as simple as it sounds.
[time=1236] Missionaries and evangelists who minister in foreign cultures caution us about taking at faith value.
[time=1244] All the reports we may hear in this country about thousands of people raising their hands or signing a card or praying a prayer.
[time=1255] They have cautioned us that some of that is not exactly what it seems to be. Apparently faith involves more than we may have supposed.
[time=1267] What is the faith that saves after all?
[time=1271] We hear all kinds of popular songs and statements of various sorts that you just have to have faith and things will work out.
[time=1282] What is the faith that saves?
[time=1286] In the world of religious thought, there's also a continuing tension about the relationship of faith and the way we live.
[time=1297] Do they have any relationship to each other?
[time=1301] It's the old conflict between creed, what I believe, and conduct, how I live.
[time=1311] Do they have a relationship? Should they have?
[time=1315] Are they two totally different issues?
[time=1319] I do one thing on Sunday and what I do the rest of the week has no relationship to what I do on Sunday.
[time=1327] That's what I believe have anything to do with how I behave.
[time=1333] Are they cause, perhaps, an effect? And the effect is merely a hope for a byproduct that may or may not occur.
[time=1345] Or is it an inevitable consequence of my faith?
[time=1351] Does what I believe determine how I live?
[time=1357] The Bible talks about this very issue in a number of passages and some of the most prominent occur in the Apostle Paul and in the writings of James.
[time=1369] And one of the interesting things is that when we read Paul and James together, there are occasions when it sounds like they really are saying something quite different.
[time=1381] Let me illustrate from the book of Romans chapter 4, where Paul was writing about what saves people, what gives them a relationship to God that merits his approval.
[time=1398] And he makes it very clear that it's faith, not works, and he uses Abraham as his illustration.
[time=1408] And he cites a particular passage from the Old Testament to prove that.
[time=1412] I'm reading from Romans 4 the first five verses.
[time=1418] What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather, according to the flesh has found?
[time=1423] For if Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about, but not before God, for what does the Scripture say?
[time=1433] And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[time=1439] Now to the one who works, his wage is not reckoned as a favor, but as what is due.
[time=1445] But to the one who does not work, but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness.
[time=1456] Paul seems very clear. It's faith that saves, not works. Abraham's experience proves it.
[time=1467] But then you turn over to the epistle of James chapter 2, and you find that James discusses the very same issue of faith and works.
[time=1480] And he also uses Abraham as his illustration, and even quotes the same verse from the Old Testament, and seems to be using it to prove the very opposite from Paul.
[time=1496] I'm reading from chapter 2, verse 21, "Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar."
[time=1510] You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected, and the Scripture was fulfilled.
[time=1521] What Scripture? The very same one Paul used, which says Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness, and he was called the friend of God.
[time=1533] Are they contradicting each other? Some people think so.
[time=1539] One of the great Protestant reformers even referred to the epistle of James as a right straw epistle, because it doesn't come across, at least it did not to him, as clearly on the doctrine of justification by faith, as Martin Luther thought it ought to.
[time=1559] What does the Bible teach us anyway? What is the faith that saves? Is it just any kind of faith, or is it a very certain kind of faith?
[time=1575] I want to direct your attention this morning to the second chapter of James, beginning with verse 14 to the end of the chapter.
[time=1583] We'll concentrate on James, because most of us, I suppose, in this audience, have a clear understanding of Paul's teaching.
[time=1594] The salvation comes by grace through faith, plus nothing. It's a free offer of the Lord Jesus Christ, in which God offers to give us righteousness, make us fit for His presence, for all eternity, on the basis of the price that the Lord Jesus paid for us at Calvary when He laid down His life for us.
[time=1621] It's James that causes the problems. So let's look at that today. James makes two propositions in this paragraph.
[time=1633] The first one is that faith without works is dead. Faith without works is dead, and he demonstrates that by showing three things that are wrong with that kind of faith.
[time=1649] If there is no activity, if there is no evidence of one's faith, James says not that it's sick, not that it needs a few things added to it, James says it's dead.
[time=1671] It's dead because there are three things wrong. Number one, it doesn't save the person who claims it, verse 14.
[time=1681] What uses it, my brethren, if a man says he has faith, but he has no works. Can that faith save him?
[time=1691] The person who makes a claim, oh, I am a Christian. But if you didn't hear him say it, you'd never know it.
[time=1702] He may recite the Lord's prayer on Sunday morning. He may recite the apostles' creed. He may know the right words to say that's on Sunday morning.
[time=1715] But the rest of the week you can't tell any difference between him and anybody else. If a man says he has faith, though does James doesn't say if he has faith, but if he says he has it, if he makes the claim, but there's no evidence.
[time=1733] James asks the question, "Can that faith save him?" And the way he phrases that question in the language in which he wrote makes it very clear that the answer expected to that question is no. That kind of faith can save him.
[time=1750] When I was a lead, I had a King James version, like everybody else, and it didn't read quite like this. James 214, the last part of it reads, "Can faith save him?"
[time=1769] And I want to say yes to that. Faith is what saves us. Paul certainly makes that clear. And so when we translate it, "Can faith save him?" And the answer to that, according to James is no, we have a problem.
[time=1786] The problem is in the translation, and not in James, because the translators of that earlier version of our Bible is left out of work. There's an article before the word faith.
[time=1801] So to simply translate, "Can faith save?" Doesn't fairly represent what James wrote. James wrote, "Can the faith that he claims to have, but there's no evidence, can that faith save him?"
[time=1819] I was reading this morning from the New American Standard Version, which I have in front of me, and they've used the word that. "Can that sort of faith save him?" And that makes it much clearer.
[time=1834] James says, "Just saying you have it doesn't make it so." The old Negro spiritual used to have it, not everybody talk about heaven as they go in there. Just saying so doesn't make it so.
[time=1849] You see, James isn't arguing in contradiction from Paul that we need two things to save us. Faith plus works, and those two together save.
[time=1861] James is saying you need a certain kind of faith, a kind of faith that works that is alive, not just a profession that's profession only, and nothing more.
[time=1877] Faith that works, not just empty claim. If all you have is empty claim, James says that doesn't help you.
[time=1888] There's something else wrong with a faith that doesn't have any works. Verses 15 to 17 say it doesn't help anybody else either.
[time=1898] He uses an illustration from everyday life of their Christian congregation, I presume, where there's some Christian brother or sister that's fallen on hard times, maybe through persecution and he's lost everything, or he's lost his job, or whatever.
[time=1917] If a brother or a sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and be filled, and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?"
[time=1938] He's writing to Jewish Christians, and he says if you see one of your Christian brothers in desperate need of material goods, and all you can do is give the usual greeting,
[time=1954] shalom, peace, be warmed, be filled, but you don't help him. What good is that? It's like one of us saying to a needy Christian brother, "Well, the Lord bless you."
[time=1972] And that's all we do. Forgetting that these are brothers and sisters in Christ, that we are members of the same spiritual family,
[time=1981] that we have a spiritual responsibility to one another, to assist in time of need, to show the kind of love that God in Christ has shown to us.
[time=1994] This is not a unique idea with James in our Bible. Paul said the same thing. He wrote in 1 Timothy chapter 5, that if any Christian has believers in his family, and he was thinking of those particularly in need and thinking of needy widows,
[time=2016] and you don't do anything about it, you have denied the faith and are worse than an unbeliever, because even unbelievers recognize that there is family responsibility.
[time=2031] They don't always fulfill that responsibility, but they recognize it exists. Certainly Christians ought to.
[time=2039] And if we shut our eyes to that sort of thing, where worse he says than unbelievers, John taught the same thing.
[time=2047] In 1 John chapter 3, verse 17, he writes, "Whosoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother having a need, and shuts up his heart of compassion against him.
[time=2062] How can you say the love of God dwells in him? How indeed, true Christianity has made us new creations," says the New Testament.
[time=2077] "It has made us sharers of God's life of compassion. There should be evidence, therefore, if you have new life, because life always evidences.
[time=2091] It's self." In fact, he says in verse 17, "Even so faith if it has no works is dead by itself."
[time=2107] Those last two words have posed a challenge for translators, probably forever, because the original text just has two words
[time=2120] that could be translated according to itself. But it isn't all that clear exactly how that fits together.
[time=2128] The translators of the verse and I have have supplied the word "being," it's in italics, to tell me it's a supplied word, "being by itself."
[time=2138] You could translate that preposition "by" as measured by. Often it's carries the idea of measurement, so that the sense would be something like this.
[time=2148] Faith that has no works, no demonstrations, no evidence, is dead as measured by itself.
[time=2159] If you just look at the claim that this person has, but then you examine all the ramifications and you see nothing positive coming out of it.
[time=2170] You draw some conclusions. When you see a body lying down, it may look like a man, same general dimensions, same features, same profile.
[time=2185] But when the coroner comes and he examines on the basis of the body itself, when he finds no heartbeat, no pulse, looks at the eyes, as measured by itself.
[time=2204] He will say, "Even though it looks like a living man, it's a dead man." James says, "When you look at somebody's claim to have Christian faith, and you find nothing but claim, there's nothing coming out of it.
[time=2224] There's no kind of demonstrations that hear his life and vitality and something has changed and something has happened." You conclude, "It's dead."
[time=2236] What's wrong with that kind of faith? It doesn't help the one who claims it. It doesn't help anybody else either.
[time=2244] In fact, the third thing he says about it, it's incapable of showing to anyone that it even exists.
[time=2255] Someone may well say, "You have faith, and I have works. Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works."
[time=2266] The only way you can demonstrate that you really have genuine, saving, living faith is by the evidences of your life.
[time=2278] And if there are no evidences there, James says, "Well show me your faith apart from those works, and he knows there's nothing to show."
[time=2290] Even a person who may make a claim and say, "Well, I did make the profession, I did say the words."
[time=2300] James says, verse 19, "You believe that God is one? You do well." Every Jewish Christian, even before they became Christians, used to recite that Jewish confession.
[time=2314] The Lord thy God, the Lord is one. The James says, "Even the demons believe that God is one."
[time=2324] And they're not just saying that without accepting the fact, they shudder because they know God is one, and they know their doom is certain.
[time=2334] One occasion demons said to Jesus, "Don't cast us into the abyss before the time." They had no doubts about what their future prospect held.
[time=2344] But even though they believed that that was in store for them, and they believed that there is one God, that didn't save them.
[time=2355] Because simply knowing something intellectually is far different from that trust in God that accepts His promises, and allows Him to make of them new creations in Christ, and give them new life, and set their feet on a different path.
[time=2374] Faith without works, says James, is dead. I'm glad he doesn't leave us on that note. He has a second proposition. He wants to declare.
[time=2387] And that is that the faith which saves us, the faith which wins God's approval, is a faith that works, verses 20 to 26.
[time=2402] He says, do you want some demonstration of that? Would you readers, you hearers like to know that that is really how it operates?
[time=2412] Let me give you an illustration, and it goes to Abraham, the friend of God, the father of that Jewish nation, the one whom we all revere as the great father of faith.
[time=2426] Would you like to know what kind of faith Abraham had? Do you think all he did was recite the right words and claim to have it, and that was all?
[time=2438] Or did he have the kind of life changing faith that demonstrated itself as making a difference in his life?
[time=2448] Well, he says, verse 21, "Was not Abraham our father justified by the kind of faith out of which works flowed, when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar."
[time=2462] Now, we have to stop and think through this just a little bit.
[time=2467] Let's not suppose that James is saying that when Abraham offered Isaac on the altar, that was the moment of his conversion, of his being brought to God.
[time=2482] Years before that, Abraham believed God, and it was counted as righteousness.
[time=2491] This passage takes place in Genesis 22, but long before Isaac was ever born in Genesis 15, verse 6, the statement is made that Abraham believed God.
[time=2505] And of course, he believed God even before Genesis 15. He believed God in Genesis 12, and God told him to leave his homeland to come to a place that he would show him, and so he did.
[time=2518] What James is demonstrating is the kind of faith that Abraham had.
[time=2523] Abraham had the kind of faith that saved, that God pronounced him justified or righteous or acceptable to him on the basis of it.
[time=2532] What kind of faith was it?
[time=2534] James says, "I'll tell you what kind of faith it was." It was the kind of faith that when God said to Abraham, "I want you to sacrifice to me your son."
[time=2547] Isaac, he was willing to do it.
[time=2554] I'm glad God never asked me to do something like that.
[time=2559] But Abraham had the kind of faith that was willing to say, "If God clearly indicates this is what he is asking me to do, I'll do it."
[time=2572] What a conflict that must have put into the mind of Abraham.
[time=2579] God had promised to him, "I'll make of you a great nation and give blessing to you and through you to all the nations of the world."
[time=2590] And Abraham had no children.
[time=2594] Later on, he had Ishmael by the slave woman and then Isaac threw Sarah.
[time=2605] And there came a time when Abraham asked some questions that God said to him, "In Isaac, will I fulfill this promise?
[time=2613] In Isaac, will your descendants be called?" And now he's asking him to sacrifice Isaac when Isaac has no children.
[time=2624] How is God going to fulfill that promise to Abraham if Isaac is taken before there any offspring?
[time=2634] But Abraham never faltered.
[time=2636] In fact, the book of Hebrews says that he did it expecting God to resurrect him.
[time=2644] "True men this faith." No wonder Jewish people honored him as the father of the faithful of the believing ones.
[time=2655] Our author, James, tells us that was the kind of faith that Abraham had.
[time=2661] And when he did it, his faith was the kind that was working, verse 22, with his works.
[time=2671] And as a result of the works, his faith was perfected or completed.
[time=2679] It doesn't say his faith was created at that time.
[time=2684] But his faith became fully developed. He always had that kind of faith.
[time=2692] But when that moment of the greatest test of his life occurred, that's when his faith reached its highest level of growth and maturity.
[time=2703] He always had that kind of faith.
[time=2707] But the offering of Isaac brought it to full growth.
[time=2712] Perhaps we could illustrate it by a very homely illustration.
[time=2715] I have a maple tree in my front yard.
[time=2718] And every spring, our yard is covered with little seedlings that sprout up to be an inch or two high.
[time=2729] What are those little annoyances in my front yard?
[time=2732] They're little maple trees.
[time=2735] That's what they are. They're not anything else.
[time=2737] They'll never grow up and yield tomatoes. They're maple trees.
[time=2742] And yet we can certainly say that those little maple trees have not been perfected or completed until they would grow and produce seedlings of their own.
[time=2755] But they were always maple trees.
[time=2758] So Abraham, long before he offered Isaac, had saving faith.
[time=2766] It was brought to its highest development and we can all grow in faith in our Christian lives.
[time=2773] It came to its highest development when he offered Isaac, but it was always that kind of faith.
[time=2779] And if Abraham had died before the Isaac episode occurred, he still had saving faith and God pronounced him righteous.
[time=2790] But his was the kind of faith that worked.
[time=2794] Well, I can imagine that some of those early readers might have been saying to themselves,
[time=2800] "James, your letter is convincing and it's interesting, but I'm finding it difficult to relate myself to Abraham."
[time=2810] Because we have him on a pedestal. He's the founder of our nation.
[time=2815] And he had the most sublime faith that most of us should even think about trying to follow.
[time=2823] Alright, says James, I'll give you illustration number two.
[time=2827] We'll go to the other extreme in the social circle.
[time=2832] We'll go to Rahab, the highlight.
[time=2836] The woman of Shady reputation, a Canaanite from Jericho.
[time=2845] What about her?
[time=2848] You recall the incident from the Old Testament that when Joshua set out the spies to look over the land of Canaan before the Israelites would move in to take over,
[time=2858] that this Canaanite woman who lived in Jericho sheltered the spies, hid them, sent them out by a different way to escape the wrath of the Canaanite leaders.
[time=2873] Why did she do that?
[time=2876] Let's look at the passage. Verse 25, "In the same way was not Rahab the Harlot also justified declared righteous by works when she received the messengers the spies and sent them out by another way."
[time=2896] What happened?
[time=2899] It came a day when this Canaanite woman, along with the others in her city of Jericho, must have stood on the walls of their city and looked out across the Jordan River to the valley on the far side,
[time=2917] and perhaps seen some of that horde of two million Israelites, a threat to her country.
[time=2927] She may have heard some of the stories going around that how this people used to be slaves in Egypt, the most powerful kingdom of that day,
[time=2937] and their guide brought them out, a series of miracles that were imposed upon the nation of Israel and brought her to her knees.
[time=2950] God led them out into the wilderness, a place where you really couldn't survive very long without some help, and he fed them forty years.
[time=2960] Even their shoes didn't wear out. She heard about all that, and Rahab decided, "I want to be a part of the worshippers of the God of Israel."
[time=2977] But that was no mere idol passing fancy on her part.
[time=2983] She believed it with the kind of faith that was alive, something happened to her.
[time=2992] God changed her heart, and she demonstrated the reality of her faith by the life she lived thereafter.
[time=3004] I'm sure that the name, Rahab the harlot, got attached to her because of her former life.
[time=3013] Surely she abandoned that lifestyle when she came into the knowledge of the true God.
[time=3019] But memories are long in the Middle East, Simon the leper entertained Jesus and the disciples for dinner.
[time=3026] He could not have still been a leper if Jesus and the disciples had gone there for dinner.
[time=3031] He must have been one of those lepers that Jesus healed, but he had gotten the name and he never could get rid of it.
[time=3038] I think that's true of Rahab.
[time=3040] Later on, she becomes one of the ancestors of Jesus himself, according to Matthew's genealogy and Matthew chapter one.
[time=3050] What kind of faith did she have? Empty profession? Oh no. She trusted the God of Israel and her works demonstrated it.
[time=3064] Therefore our author can say, as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
[time=3075] How can we bring Paul and James together?
[time=3080] I read a story many years ago that illustrated it, I think, in a very effective way.
[time=3087] A little boy lived in the country with his family and a thunderstorm with crashing thunder and bright jagged lightning.
[time=3102] Just took over the area for a time. A little boy was frightened and ran to his room.
[time=3109] And after it was all over, he came out and asked his father as they stood on the front porch and surveyed the damage and saw the big tree split down the middle.
[time=3121] What made all this wreckage? Was it the crashing thunder that hurt my ears or was it the lightning that was so bright?
[time=3131] And the father said, I know that thunder was very loud, that it frightened you and you covered your ears.
[time=3138] But really it was the lightning that split the oak tree.
[time=3145] When you ask the question, what saves people? Faith or works? Paul answers that question.
[time=3155] And he says, faith is what saves people. And you can never do enough works of law or any other kind of works to save yourself.
[time=3167] You have to trust God to do the work for you and he did it when he sent Jesus to die in your place.
[time=3176] But then the little boy asked another question, that he does all lightning hurt you.
[time=3187] And the father said, well, no, there are several kinds of lightning.
[time=3191] There's a kind of lightning we call summer lightning or heat lightning that comes at the end of a hot day and are part of the country where you see twilight coming on and the light shimmering in the heavens.
[time=3205] It's noiseless. That doesn't hurt anybody. So we don't make you come in. We just let you play.
[time=3216] When we ask the question, does all faith save us? That's the one James answers.
[time=3224] And he says, why, as a matter of fact, no, not all faith saves. Not mere empty claim. That doesn't say.
[time=3234] Not just intellectual awareness that there is a God. That doesn't say. Only the kind of faith that accepts the promises of God.
[time=3246] That trusts him. Not only believes they are true, but says, yes, I want that for me. Thank you, Lord.
[time=3256] That's when God steps in. And he regenerates. He gives new birth. He gives new life. He makes us brand new.
[time=3268] The faith that saves is the faith that is alive. It's the faith that works. It's the faith that makes a difference.
[time=3280] It's the faith that can be seen. And while Christians grow in their Christian lives at different rates, and none of us grows as quickly as we ought,
[time=3294] and as thoroughly as we ought in our Christian perceptions, we all, if we have the faith that saves,
[time=3304] will have the kind of faith whereby the Holy Spirit makes us new, gets us to work, makes us active.
[time=3316] And just as there is a discernible difference between a newborn little baby who's alive and a stillbirth,
[time=3330] so there is a difference between those who just make profession and those who truly trust with the faith that saves.
[time=3344] May God grant to each of us the understanding from this passage to make very sure that we have the kind of faith that saves.
[time=3354] Our Father, we thank you that you have not left us on our own, that you've instructed us. You've done the work.
[time=3363] And all we need to do is trust thee for it, but when we genuinely do, it'll make a difference. It'll make a difference in the way we live.
[time=3373] We want our faith to be more clearly seen as the days go by in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[time=3400] For so thankful that you joined with us today for the music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and soloist Becky Woman.
[time=3407] The absence of our pastor teacher Russell Moore, our guest speaker, was Dr. Homer Kent from Grace Schools in Winona Lake, Indiana.
[time=3415] A very appreciative of his ministry to us today. I know that you were thoroughly blessed by his message.
[time=3421] And if as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take this moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3430] Would you bow your heads with me? Do you have any Father? I'm really thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I have sinned against you and I ask for your forgiveness of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3443] I ask you also to come into my heart and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3452] If you prayed that prayer today would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision. When you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
