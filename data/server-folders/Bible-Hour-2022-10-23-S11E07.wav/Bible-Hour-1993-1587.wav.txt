[time=0] And I think that permeates our culture.
[time=4] I think that permeates Christianity as well as the secular culture, where people are more committed to a kind of life than principles by which to live their lives.
[time=30] And an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=35] Thank you for joining us.
[time=38] What are your plans for 1993?
[time=41] What are you hoping to see happen in your life over the next 12 months?
[time=45] On today's program, Pastor Moore draws six exciting principles from God's Word that promised to make 1993 the best year of your life.
[time=54] We encourage you to locate your Bibles so that you can study along with us.
[time=58] We will be looking at several different passages during today's study.
[time=62] Our special music today will feature our Sanctuary Choir,
[time=69] the Handbell Choir, and read LaFavor. Let's now join our service.
[time=101] We are gathered in this house to celebrate his name.
[time=110] To tell him we're happy, so happy he prayed.
[time=120] We know we're made worthy by the Holy Name.
[time=128] We stand here as tropeys of his power to save.
[time=141] Oh, with worship, worship, Jesus our Lord, our Lord, we magnify him, and glorify him, Jesus, the one we adore.
[time=172] We are sheep of his pastor, he knows us by name, and we're sure that he loves us, each one just must save.
[time=189] And we all need to see him in power and light, and it seems as he prays him, his Lord is inside.
[time=208] Oh, with worship, worship, worship, Jesus our Lord, our Lord, we magnify him, and glorify him, Jesus, the one we adore.
[time=236] Oh, with worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship.
[time=251] We magnify him, and glorify him, Jesus, the one we adore.
[time=266] Oh, with worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship, worship.
[time=296] [AMEN - 130 seconds]
[time=436] Well, I'm very thankful that you tuned into the Bible hour today, and if you're watching for the first time, I hope that you will enjoy the ministry of music and the message from our pastor.
[time=454] You've already been inspired, no doubt, by the choir and the handbell choir, and just a few minutes you'll hear, "Soloist Read La Favour."
[time=462] Our pastor is back this Sunday, and I want to encourage you to stay tuned for the entire broadcast in just a few minutes.
[time=468] He'll be giving a six-point message on encouragement, encouragement for the Christian to give 100% toward the serving of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=478] Now, I hope you'll listen, and you'll be inspired by what Pastor Moore has to say about the way Christians should live, and should represent our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=488] Also, next week, Pastor Moore will have a guest on the insert, and then his subject will be very timely as he speaks on the issue of abortion.
[time=498] I hope that you'll make a special note to tune in to the Bible hour next week, as Pastor Moore speaks on this issue.
[time=504] And then I want to tell you about a special event that's coming up in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=510] We're doing a musical program on Sunday evening February 14th at 6 p.m.
[time=516] We're entitling it, "Celebrate God's greatness." It'll be an evening of hymns, of anthems, of choruses, involving the sanctuary choir, our orchestra, and our congregation together, just celebrating the greatness of our Lord.
[time=532] Note that date, and come with and join with us for this great evening of worship on Sunday February 14th at 6 p.m.
[time=542] I know that the choir has been working on the music for some time now, and I've really been inspired and encouraged by the variety of music that will just help you and enrich your Christian life.
[time=552] So once again, that Sunday evening, February 14th at 6 p.m. Then last week, I told you about the Daily Walk calendar. Well, I'll be offering it during the month of January.
[time=564] It's a year calendar, also with some scripture reading, a thought for the day, and a process by which you can read through the entire Bible in one year.
[time=575] Again, it's called the Daily Walk Bible Calendar, and we want you to receive it absolutely free. You can write to the Bible Hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=592] Once again, just write to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=601] This calendar will be sent to you absolutely free, and we do this partly to give you something that will help you in your Christian life, and also just to confirm the fact that you're watching the Bible Hour, and we'd love to hear from you.
[time=615] We asked last week if there'd be 100 of you that would write in for the calendar, and I hope that next week I can tell you that 100 people wrote in to ask for the calendar, and that'll be a great encouragement to us.
[time=627] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our service for some more music, and then again that timely message from our pastor and title resolutions.
[time=636] I hope that you'll stay tuned for our entire broadcast.
[time=658] Oh, how I love the King, how I adore my breath and my sunshine, my all in all.
[time=682] Oh, the Great Creator, He gave my Savior, and our God's fullness, whoever He is, down from His glory.
[time=711] Ever living stone, my God and the Savior came, and the Jesus was His name.
[time=725] Born in a manger, to His own astray.
[time=735] A man of sorrows, tears and agony.
[time=746] What kind of sin shall bring us redemption, that in the dead of night not one face hope doesn't serve?
[time=763] God, in His mercy, laid aside His splendor.
[time=772] It's to be here to move and win, to save my own soul.
[time=798] Oh, how I love him, how I adore him.
[time=810] He is my breath and my sunshine, and my all in all.
[time=822] Oh, the Great Creator, He gave my Savior, and our God's fullness, and our God's fullness.
[time=849] Oh, how I love him.
[time=881] Nice song, Reed, but next time could you sing it with a little more passion?
[time=886] Good job, buddy, then that sounds good when he just knocks it out like that.
[time=892] Well, we're in a study of Revelation, and we've finished a section of the book, and I want to take a few Sundays and depart from the book.
[time=899] We've finished the first several chapters, and we've been talking about the seven churches that open up that book.
[time=905] And sometimes, when we're going through a book of the Bible, like Revelation, and we kind of reach a major point of division in the thought of the book,
[time=912] like to step away from the book and cover some other things.
[time=916] And this morning I want to do that, and next Sunday I want to talk to you a little bit about probably the abortion issue, as that's a day of recognizing the right to life.
[time=924] And then I may come back the following Sunday and talk to you about goals and vision for our church, and how God could use us in 1993.
[time=934] But this morning what I'd like to do is talk to you a little bit about your own personal life and your aspirations and goals, or maybe you could call them New Year's resolutions, although I'm not real big on that, but we might find ourselves into that kind of a category this morning.
[time=949] And it really comes out of a conversation I had with a couple that I dearly love back in California.
[time=955] We'll call them this morning, Dave and Debbie, Dave as a student at the Master's College, distinguished himself as a marvelously gifted young man.
[time=965] He was a leader among his peers.
[time=967] He eventually took on a role in chapel that the students just loved because he was one of them.
[time=972] They elected him to be their student body president, and he was very effective in communicating truth to them and shaping their perceptions and leading them in positive directions.
[time=982] He was so good at all of that that when he graduated, actually even before he graduated, we hired him to be a part of the student life staff and to be the director of all campus activities, which was an enormous job of responsibility to give leadership, and to demonstrate, and to organize, and to build vision, and to do things with the students.
[time=1001] He just performed wonderfully, and to this day he still is performing above and beyond the call of duty in that capacity.
[time=1009] Shortly after I left the Master's College, he married this gal named Debbie who is a tremendous young lady.
[time=1016] She comes from a missionary home. She spent most of her life overseas.
[time=1020] She has a real heart for missions and for people and for evangelism and for the things like that that would fill her life and heart and mind.
[time=1028] And you anticipate a couple like this just exploding into ministry and being greatly used of God.
[time=1035] It was their desire and mine as well to grab a bite to eat during these nine days that I had in California.
[time=1042] So we went to a little place called Danny's and it's a favorite place we have there in Newhall, where the Master's College is, and brought back some memories, and we were just chatting a little bit.
[time=1051] I said, Dave, how long do you suppose you'll be at the Master's College?
[time=1055] I mean, you've held this position now for three years. What are you thinking about the future?
[time=1062] And he said, well, I'm not really sure. I'm not really sure what I want to do.
[time=1069] And he said, well, actually I'm kind of thinking about being a camp director.
[time=1079] And I said, really, what is it about that that is attractive to you?
[time=1083] Well, it's up in the mountains. I'm really tired of living in the city. I just don't think I'm a city person.
[time=1091] And there's a beautiful little cabin up there and there's some trees and on the facility or on the campus of this camp, there's a lake and you can fish.
[time=1103] And it's just beautiful. And the house is really neat that they have there.
[time=1108] And I just kind of see myself there. I said, really? He said, yeah, he kind of knew then that my antennas were up.
[time=1118] I said, Dave, do you know what a camp director does? And he said, not really.
[time=1125] I said, Dave, camp directors spend 85% of their time doing two things.
[time=1132] One, making sure that the facilities are in good repair. And two, asking people for money to build new facilities.
[time=1143] I said, is that you? I knew it wasn't. And he said, no, I guess not, not really.
[time=1155] And what I heard in that conversation and what I heard in his heart, I hear often when Christians think about tomorrow.
[time=1164] Too often, Christians are wanting a kind of life.
[time=1170] Dave is envisioning a kind of life up in the mountains, away from the city with the trees and the birds and the bees and the lake.
[time=1183] And he is envisioning for himself good things in that kind of life.
[time=1189] And I want to suggest to you that there is another way to live.
[time=1194] That as we would look at 1993, and as you would ask yourself, what do I want out of 1993?
[time=1201] I would want to say some things to you this morning that would move you if you're in that condition, from anticipating and hoping and working for a kind of life, to instead devoting yourselves to certain principles by which to live life,
[time=1216] and then let the chips fall where they may as to what kind of life you end up with.
[time=1222] I believe that God has called us to live according to some very important principles.
[time=1229] I don't believe that God has called us to orchestrate our lives to a certain kind of life that is pleasing and that seems almost utopia of sorts.
[time=1238] And so if I could challenge your thinking this morning, I have about five or six points here that I'd like to just throw at you.
[time=1245] And I'd like you to write them down, and I'd like you to think about them with light of 1993, and to say, "Man, what would happen if I chose to live according to these principles in 1993?"
[time=1257] The first one. The first one comes out of John, John 12.
[time=1265] And if we're going to title this first little point, it would be "live to give."
[time=1272] And they're not all going to rhyme like that, so don't get excited. That one did.
[time=1278] But live to give, John 12 verses 24 and 25. Jesus is speaking in verse 23, John 12, 23.
[time=1290] And Jesus answered them saying, "The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified, and you know what he meant."
[time=1297] He didn't mean everybody was going to get in a line and say, "Praise Jesus. He meant everybody's going to get in a line and watch Him be crucified."
[time=1303] He's saying, "The hour is upon me, and I am going to die. I'm going to give my life away."
[time=1309] And then He draws the principle, verses 24 and 25, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains by itself alone."
[time=1322] It remains by itself alone, but if it dies, it bears much fruit.
[time=1328] He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world shall keep it to the life eternal.
[time=1338] My dad used to say there's two kinds of people in the world.
[time=1341] The first kind of a person is the person that wakes up in the morning and starts to anticipate the day and thinks through the calendar and thinks through what's coming in the next 24 hours and asks this one question.
[time=1352] What is in this day for me?
[time=1357] What are the things in this day that I'm going to enjoy and that I get out of this day?
[time=1361] What are the things that are going to make me happy in the next 24 hours?
[time=1366] That's the person that is like the grain of wheat that never dies.
[time=1372] It's never put into the earth and dies, and as it says in verse 24, it remains by itself alone.
[time=1380] Penetrating words. I mean, the Lord can just strike to the heart of an issue.
[time=1385] If we are the kind of people who wake up every morning envisioning what can happen right for us and what we can get out of our life, we will remain alone.
[time=1395] We will be hopelessly lonely, hopelessly empty, hopelessly lost, not in the sense of salvation, but lost with a sense of purpose.
[time=1405] And we will inevitably come to the end of every day empty and we will have bored no fruit.
[time=1412] The second out of person is the person who wakes up in the morning and thinks through the agenda of his day and the people he or she will encounter and says, what can I give to those people?
[time=1421] How can I meaningfully touch their lives?
[time=1425] What is it about me that can do something or give something to minister in a positive way to the people I'm going to encounter in the next 24 hours?
[time=1433] That kind of person is the person who dies.
[time=1437] He is surrendering his demand to have life in his own way and to be pleasing and to be satisfying and this kind of life that is so elusive.
[time=1448] And says instead, bury me in the ground, let me die for when I die I bear much fruit.
[time=1455] Verse 25, I refuse to love my life. I want to lose my life and he uses the contrast of love and hate.
[time=1463] He's not saying that you're supposed to hate life in the sense that you wake up in every day is an absolute bummer.
[time=1469] He's saying to compare and contrast, if you love you and if you love yourself and if you live for yourself and if you're only asking the question, what can this day bring into me for me?
[time=1481] If you love that, forget it, hate your life, give it up, throw it away, expend it on people.
[time=1489] Go into every encounter with every person in your day and ask this one simple question, what can I do to help this person?
[time=1497] What can I do to give to this person?
[time=1501] That's the way to live. That's the way to live. That's a principle you can live by.
[time=1507] Doesn't matter if you're living in the mountains or by the beach, you can live by that.
[time=1512] If we could ever realize just how the Lord has worked this principle into the fabric of life or reality.
[time=1522] This is as strong a principle as gravity. This is as strong a reality as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.
[time=1531] This is just the stuff of life. People who get up and look to satisfy their own needs are empty and alone and they bear no fruit.
[time=1541] And people who get up in the morning and say, "Who can I give my life away to today? Feel joy and they feel fullness and they feel complete and they bear fruit and they save their life."
[time=1555] You say, "Man, I don't have anything to give. You got this wrong." Yeah, it was good for Jesus and that may have been good for his apostles.
[time=1567] But you're talking, you got to remember, you're talking to me this morning. I'm just Joe Church member here.
[time=1573] I'm just Christian person trying to live till dinner.
[time=1578] I didn't go to seminary and I don't know the Bible really well and I'm just trying to eke out an existence on this planet. Right?
[time=1587] Wrong. Wrong. Come with me to one of my favorite verses in the whole Bible, Ephesians chapter 2, verse 10.
[time=1601] And this is just wonderful. It says there Ephesians 2,10, "For we are his workmanship."
[time=1609] We are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=1617] This word workmanship, as it's translated in my Bible, means masterpiece. You are the very masterpiece of God.
[time=1626] When you came to Christ, you were made a masterpiece by the master himself. You are his best work.
[time=1634] And you say, "Wait a minute, what am I so masterfully made for? I can't sit down at the organ or the piano like Scott and look up in the sky and just play anything that comes into my mind."
[time=1647] I am not Mr. Gifted intellectually. I don't run the major corporations in Fort Wayne. People aren't looking at me saying, "Now there is a marvelously gifted person."
[time=1661] I'm not the most beautiful thing that ever graced the planet.
[time=1668] What do you mean I'm a masterpiece? In what dimension are you trying to tell me that I am a work of art?
[time=1676] Because when I look in the mirror, I don't see it. You are a work of art with respect to your ability to invest in the lives of the people in your life.
[time=1691] That's it. That's it. You are a masterpiece created by God himself in Christ Jesus with a capacity to make a significant difference in the lives of the people you know if you're willing to do it.
[time=1705] And he can use you beyond your wildest dreams. The other thing that I wish we would understand about ourselves is that you are surrounded by a bunch of people who are starving to be touched by you.
[time=1719] I mean they are just dying for a touch from your life that is for them.
[time=1728] Let me give you some arenas. Excuse me in which to think about this. You husbands. This frog may or may not go away.
[time=1739] You husbands. Just let me put it right down here on the table. Are you as committed to being successful in your wife's life?
[time=1757] Or the life of your wife as you are at work or recreation?
[time=1767] Are you as purposeful? Are you as dedicated? Are you as premeditated? Are you as thoughtful? Are you as energized? Are you as motivated to move into her life and bless the socks off that woman as you are to move into the place of employment and keep your job for another day?
[time=1786] That's what it is. That's where he says bear yourself. Let yourself die. Be like a grain of wheat so you can bear fruit.
[time=1799] Let me ask you wives. Are you absolutely committed to the notion that you are going to crown your husband's life with your loving faithfulness as Solomon said?
[time=1812] I don't know what that means in your life. I know what that means when Heidi does that to me in the ways that she pursues that in my life and I know when she's not doing it.
[time=1823] We all know how we interface with our mate but what I'm asking is is that a priority in your life to get up in the morning and say how in the world can I enhance and enrich the life of the one I pledged my life to?
[time=1840] What about your kids? If we bring all your kids in here for those of you for those of us who have kids and we survey them and we say tell me about the energy in your dad's life.
[time=1849] What is he really excited about? Is the kid going to say me? I'm it. I'm the apple of his eye.
[time=1862] Not because he says that but because he spends time with me because he understands me because he is investing in me because he already has plans for 1993 to take me to so and so and do such and such.
[time=1877] Do you understand what I'm saying? That is a principle you can live by. Let me give you a real practical suggestion here.
[time=1883] Why don't you find a piece of paper about this big and write down on it the names of the people. You can't do this with all of Fort Wayne. We have to narrow this down.
[time=1892] Write down the names of the people that you really believe that God has you on this planet to invest in their life. Put it right there on a piece of paper and then stick that piece of paper in the front part of your Bible.
[time=1906] And then every Sunday when you come whether it's during a song or whether it's during that time before the service just open that and look at those names and ask yourself the question what can I do in the next seven days.
[time=1923] It's a positively impact. One, two, three, four, five, six names on this list and then do it. I promise you you'll have a great 93.
[time=1937] Principle number two. Principle number two. I just put in the front leaf of my Bible. Principle number two. Assume full responsibility. Assume full responsibility for your ambassador ship.
[time=1951] Now I know that's confusing. Come with me over to second Corinthians chapter five. Second Corinthians chapter five. Assume full responsibility for your ambassador ship.
[time=1962] Now notice I didn't say become an ambassador. You already are an ambassador. The only question is are you going to be a faithful ambassador and I'm probably going to return to this passage in a couple of weeks when I talk about our church.
[time=1974] Just briefly this morning, look in verse 20. Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ as though God were in treating through us. We beg you on behalf of Christ be reconciled to God.
[time=1987] He's saying we are ambassadors and our job and our mission is to entreat as if the living Christ were speaking in and through us to the unsaved people in our world that they would be reconciled to God.
[time=2000] Are you going to be a faithful ambassador in 1993? You say how do they become an ambassador? Look at verses 14 and 15.
[time=2008] For the love of Christ controls us. Having concluded this that one died for all. Therefore all died. Verse 15. And he died for all that they who live should no longer live for themselves.
[time=2022] There it is that they who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died and rose again on their behalf. You became an ambassador because Christ died for you and you received the loving gracious forgiveness provided in his death in his becoming like a grain of wheat that was buried and died and then bore much fruit. You're the fruit.
[time=2042] And in response to that what the Bible is saying is you can no longer live for yourself. Live for Christ. Live as a faithful ambassador.
[time=2052] Let me talk about one arena in which you are called to be an ambassador for Christ and that's your work. Most of us are going to spend five, six, seven days at work in the next seven days.
[time=2065] It's going to be a consuming thing with our time. Why are you going to go to work this week? Why are you going to go to work in 1993? Why are you going to get up in the morning, get showered, shaved, dressed and get in the car and go to work?
[time=2080] A lot of people are going to do that because they need money. It's pretty practical. I've got a lot of bills to pay. I've got a roof to put over my head. I've got clothes to put on our back and I've got food to put in our face. And that costs money.
[time=2092] I am simply going to work because I need the money to provide for my family.
[time=2099] Other people are going to say I'm going to work because I love my work. I mean this is my aptitude. This is what I do. This is what I've always loved engineering.
[time=2108] I mean as a little kid I was destroying the radios in our house and tearing everything apart. I always did that and now I get to do it for a living. I love it.
[time=2118] I love the principles of engineering. I love my work and when I go there I get trained and I get to explore and I get to see all these fascinating things and the mind that God has given me just permeates all the...
[time=2128] I just love my work. Some of you are teachers and you say I just, I live to teach. I want to teach. I can't wait to get to the classroom and see the little light bulbs go on the kids' minds inside that classroom when I do it this way.
[time=2141] Some of you are medical doctors and you're saying I've always been fascinated with biology and I love to help people and when I can get in there and figure out their medical problems and bring a solution, I just love that.
[time=2154] Some of you are going to go to work for money because you've got to pay for the bills, some of you are going to work because it's your aptitude, it's your energy, it's your excitement.
[time=2160] Others of you are going to work for a sense of identity and self-esteem. Who would I be if I don't go to work?
[time=2166] In other words, it's my station, it's my place, it's what marks me out in this community, it's the people I'd circulate with, this is my identity.
[time=2176] I'm not saying that any and all of those are necessarily wrong in another themselves but they fall far short of the kind of principle that makes for a great 93.
[time=2185] You want to know why God wants you to go to work? Because that is your sphere of influence for the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2193] That is your mission field. Those are your people. He led you to that place of work so that you could touch their lives with the gospel.
[time=2201] Whether you have opportunity to articulate it with your mouth or live it with your life, then of course I'm not an advocate of using work time to share the gospel.
[time=2210] But to see that whole arena as your place, your mission field, your desire and passion is to go to work and to be a godly person there and to do all those other things.
[time=2220] But ultimately for the cause that those people will see Christ through you.
[time=2227] I promise you that I'll transform your work habits and your view about life and your view about work.
[time=2235] So it's some full responsibility for your ambassadorship.
[time=2240] Let me just give you a little practical thing maybe if you wanted to do this.
[time=2244] You could just take a little piece of paper and write ambassador on it and just stick it right on your steering wheel.
[time=2252] So that every day when you go to work you have to look at the word ambassador and be reminded that this is not just about money, it's not just about your aptitudes, it's not just about a sense of self worth and being in existence in Fort Wayne.
[time=2265] It's really all about Christ, it's really all about telling people about Christ and ask Him how today can I do that?
[time=2273] Principle number three.
[time=2277] Make 93 the year in which you pursue genuine relationships, genuine relationships.
[time=2285] And if you would, come over to Galatians for a minute. Galatians chapter six verse one.
[time=2293] And there's a level of involvement that's described in these verses that is so appealing to me and at the same time so threatening to me.
[time=2300] There's something in these verses that I want desperately but I'm scared to death to have.
[time=2307] Galatians chapter six verse one.
[time=2310] Brother and even if a man is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one who in a spirit of gentleness, each one looking to yourself, unless you to be tempted.
[time=2320] Verse two.
[time=2323] Bear one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ. For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself, you know what you hear in that passage?
[time=2334] You hear people being involved at a level of real genuine contact where the rubber is really meeting the road in their life.
[time=2349] Where sin is becoming apparent and I don't think it has to be some major top 10 thing. I think anything there, you remember this word restore.
[time=2358] It's used in the New Testament of restoring nets are mending nets, the fishermen on the sea of Galilee and they throw the nets out and they get ripped.
[time=2365] Something would rip the net and the net becomes useless.
[time=2368] And so the word restore they would sit in their boat and they would use their little tools and they would restore that net and make it viable again, make it usable again.
[time=2377] This is describing a level of intimacy, a level of genuine trust in relationship that allows that kind of involvement to go on on a regular basis.
[time=2389] Where I let you see me for who I am, I let you know, I let you on the inside, you see the weaknesses, you see the failure, you see the struggle which puts you in a position to then mend me.
[time=2406] Like this, some of your, you would call your very best friends.
[time=2415] And the only place at which they really get to intersect in your life is to give much needed sympathy at points of trial.
[time=2422] But as far as letting them in to know and to trust them with your, your frailty and your weakness.
[time=2430] No, that's a lonely way to live. It's a lonely, it's not the way God meant for it to be.
[time=2438] Bear one another's burdens, what burdens?
[time=2441] In this passage, we're not talking about financial burdens and in this passage, we're not talking about the burden of being physically sick.
[time=2448] In this passage, we're talking about the burden of having stepped off the path of obedience.
[time=2455] One of the great concerns I had when moving to this city was leaving behind the four or five people that were at this level in my life.
[time=2466] Knowing that I was going to walk away from those men who were on the inside and who did really know me.
[time=2473] I mean, they knew me, my weaknesses and my failures and my sin and my struggles. And I was afraid for that because I didn't want to come here and be isolated and then be caught in some major way by my weaknesses and let them really hurt people.
[time=2489] And it was traumatic to think about opening that up again to other people.
[time=2497] But I just want to stand as an encourager and as an example in some sense to say that in the last 18 months God has been gracious and there are now three or four men again in my life that 18 months ago I didn't even know.
[time=2512] Who can ask me any question about my life they want to ask. Any dimension of my life they have freedom to have.
[time=2519] And short of their questions I will give them the vital information on Russell Moore. Why? Because I need their help. That's what the Bible is all about. That's what becoming a Christian is all about.
[time=2534] It's not being isolated and alone. It's being encouraged and held up and lifted up and carried by other believers.
[time=2544] And because I want to do that in their life I want to be that to them.
[time=2552] To be real practical let me just give you a suggestion. I would ask you to look across the landscape of your life.
[time=2560] The people that you know in this church or in this city they may not even go to this church but their Christians.
[time=2566] And identify one or two or three and say these are the people of all the people that I know even though this is a very scary thought these are the people that I think I could trust.
[time=2577] Not to become gossips with my weakness not to beat me up with my failures but to listen and to love me and to confront me and to help me.
[time=2588] I have challenged you this morning to identify those three or four names and maybe in the next week or two grab a lunch with them and say you know what?
[time=2599] I think we could do some things here that might really be strengthening and encouraging and see where that takes you.
[time=2611] Number four. Principle number four. I just want to call this one a positive attitude.
[time=2619] Let's see it over here in Philippians four for a minute. Philippians chapter four. Philippians chapter four verse eight.
[time=2630] Finally, brother, whatever is true, you know this verse, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute if there is any excellence, if anything worthy of praise let your mind dwell on these things.
[time=2643] What he's saying is man put your focus on what's good in life.
[time=2648] Set your heart and your mind and your attention on the honorable things, the good things, the right things, the pure things, the lovely things.
[time=2657] It's like two people standing on the edge of a meadow and the one person's got this verse in their life and so they see the beautiful trees and they see the breeze running down across the prairie or the meadow itself and the things are waving back and forth and the breeze and the cows are there and the stream is running over there and they're just alive with the beauty of the meadow and they're just soaking it in.
[time=2682] And the other person is sitting next to them, they don't see all that stuff. All they see is the manure in the meadow. All they can focus on are these cow pies that are all over the meadow and they all there's one over there and oh there's another one over there and oh there's another oh and I stepped in there when right there, you know this is just horrible.
[time=2700] This is a horrible meadow. We need a different meadow. Let's find another meadow. Well guess what? There aren't any meadows without that stuff in them.
[time=2710] Make up your mind. You're going to look at that stuff or you're going to look at the good stuff.
[time=2716] Now I'm not promoting denial. I'm not promoting just closing your eyes of the hard parts of life. The word of God calls you to embrace reality.
[time=2723] But what this verse is also saying while you embrace the difficult parts of your life, look in them and through them and and around them for what is honorable and right and pure and lovely and good.
[time=2734] Things that are excellent and worthy of praise. I mean there's just no perfect place. There's no perfect church. There's no perfect except the one I'm married wife.
[time=2746] There's no perfect kids except for my four going on five. I mean you just can't have all. I already have all that stuff so you have to live with.
[time=2753] You understand what I'm saying? There is no perfect reality. So make a choice inside of reality to focus on what is right and good.
[time=2762] Grab a hold of what is right.
[time=2767] Let me go step further with that. You know in 1993 some of us are going to lose our jobs. Some of us are going to lose our health. Some of us are going to die.
[time=2777] Some of our loved ones are going to become infected with cancer. Some of us are going to go financially upside down.
[time=2788] You know that right. The Bible almost guarantees that stuff and James one it says when you consider or when you encounter various trials.
[time=2799] Didn't say if it says when you encounter them. It's a given.
[time=2805] Now what I want to ask you to do this morning is to purpose in your heart right now that whatever those trials are going to be that God's going to a lot of come into your life.
[time=2814] You've already made up your mind today that in 1993 when that trial walks and knocks on my front door I'm going to open it stick my hand out and say hi.
[time=2822] Welcome. Been waiting for you. Come on in. Stay as long as you need to stay.
[time=2831] Because I know why you're here. You're a gift of God and you're going to make my life something better for the cause of Christ.
[time=2841] Welcome. The trial is a friend and let it transform you for the cause of Christ.
[time=2847] Lastly this morning number five. I really like this principle. I just wrote down a hundred percent. A hundred and then a percent.
[time=2861] A hundred percent. Go back a page in Philippians. A Philippians three.
[time=2868] There's a little glimpse of a guy that's going a hundred percent.
[time=2874] He's kind of short. He has a hook nose. Bad eyes. He's ugly. He's been beaten up. He's scarred. He's really not sure if he's been a success in life at all but he's going a hundred percent.
[time=2884] Philippians 313, brethren. I do not regard myself as having laid hold of it yet but one thing I do for getting what lies behind and reaching forward to what lies ahead I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[time=2902] Here's a guy that has the pedal to the metal. He has pulled out the stops. He is sick and tired of a mediocre life. He doesn't want to just get by. He doesn't want to just do enough to get by.
[time=2914] The guy is saying look this is my only life. I'm going to live it absolutely to the max. When it's time to work, work a hundred percent.
[time=2922] When it's time to play, play a hundred percent. When it's time to come in here and worship God, worship God a hundred percent. When it's time to sing songs in this place, sing songs a hundred percent.
[time=2931] When it's time to do your ministry and want to on a Wednesday night, do it a hundred percent. When it's time to be with your wife, be a hundred percent with your wife.
[time=2940] You understand what I'm saying? Just do it. Be where you are and do it with all you've got. Pull the stops out. Let go of yourself and your life.
[time=2951] I had so much fun at the Master's College, just we telling them, talking to them a little bit about this principle. And I used our church as an example.
[time=2960] I said, talking about going a hundred percent, I said, you know, 16 years ago, somebody had an idea as a way to get people into our church and to tell them about Christ.
[time=2972] And their idea was a living Christmas tree. Now you understand what that says, but they don't. They kind of chuckled. When you think about it, it's kind of funny.
[time=2984] I said, the first year I understand it didn't like wrap around. It was just this flat thing that kind of sat out there and they cut holes in it and people pop their heads through and saying Christmas girls.
[time=2996] And the kids are just laughing at this. They just think this is hilarious because they're picturing it. You know, they're thinking this is stupid. This is not a good idea. What a stupid idea.
[time=3008] But then I went on to tell them. I said it got better every year. And this year, it's not a flat facade. I told them about the 10,000 pounds of steel that's been specially designed by people in this church.
[time=3024] It's an original, nowhere else.
[time=3028] To hold our 165 choir members up. And I told them about Ron Hackett and how he spends three months of his life putting up and tearing down all the storefronts with those who are willing to help him.
[time=3048] And I told them about the guys who work up in the booth and string the five miles of electrical wiring that run its way in and around and through the living Christmas tree.
[time=3059] To hook itself up to 3,200 light bulbs that are run by those three computers that sit up there and make it all happen at the right time.
[time=3066] I told them about Ken Nore and his willingness to take his aptitude and his place of work and apply it to that steel frame and that steel structure and the guys that come in here and set that thing up and get it out of this church without ripping up our sanctuary.
[time=3081] I told them about all the ladies that come in and cover the facade and put on all the needles and the packages. I told them about all the choir members who go for a whole Saturday and a Friday night to make sure they're learning their music.
[time=3092] Week after week after week after week after week for months memorize reams and reams and reams of words.
[time=3099] I told them about this funny little guy named Pastor Peter Coby who just won't settle for anything less than the best.
[time=3111] And then I told them when we opened the doors to give away our tickets one cold brisk freezing morning.
[time=3125] There was a line of people that started from the front of our church went all the way down the side and around the corner.
[time=3131] And within three hours we'd given away 22,000 tickets and they went wow.
[time=3142] I said you want to know why the living Christmas tree works because there are a whole bunch of people in this church that are giving themselves completely and totally to the living Christmas tree when it's time to do Christmas tree we do Christmas tree.
[time=3158] And they got excited about that. They got excited about dreaming and thinking maybe I could be the next kin or maybe I could be the next Ron Hackett.
[time=3167] Maybe I could be the next Peter maybe I could do that with my maybe that could happen to me if I'm willing to give myself 100%.
[time=3178] I believe it can. I believe it can happen to them and I believe it can happen to you.
[time=3186] For every one of you there is capacity in your life to serve God and do incredible things if you'll just throw yourself at it and let him take care of the results.
[time=3195] Amen? Amen.
[time=3199] I went on to tell them about the living Christmas tree about a lady that called our church. She'd been to a living Christmas tree and she's dying of cancer.
[time=3211] And she called our church then come here just called our church because of the living Christmas tree she'd been living Christmas tree she needed help she called our church.
[time=3219] She said I'm dying of cancer could somebody come talk to me please about how to get saved. And so we sent our I told them I said we spent we sent our evangelistic Rambo and you white over to I said this woman can lead anybody and anything to Christ.
[time=3235] I said if she could just get demons to materialize she could lead them to Christ which I think may be true and her husband and another person.
[time=3244] And how when they arrived at the front door of this lady's house she was so overwhelmed with joy that someone from our church had come and she got her husband to sit down and then just as they were going to start talking the lady with the cancer.
[time=3255] So just a minute just a minute I got to go she ran out the door over to her next door neighbor and drug her next door neighbor over because she felt that her next door neighbor really needed to hear what was going to happen.
[time=3265] And so for the next three and a half hours our E.E. team our E.D. team shared the gospel three and a half hours at the end of that time every single one of those people prayed to receive Christ.
[time=3278] I'll tell you what you can take an idea like the living Christmas tree you put the flesh and bones of people who care and people who won't settle for second best and who are saying I'm going to do this for all I'm worth.
[time=3291] And great great great things can happen let's breathe together.
[time=3298] Father as I look to 1993 in my own life and as I look at the hearts and souls and lives of these I've grown to love and these faithful folks a part of our church a part of our family.
[time=3311] I ask Lord that you would bring these principles and others from your word to life. Help us to be principled people people who are directed by the power of truth.
[time=3323] Help us to rise above thinking about a kind of life that we think will satisfy us that we think will make us whole that we think will fill up the emptiness for.
[time=3335] We would become like the grain of wheat that never dies but just lays there and is by itself alone instead help us to throw ourselves at life recklessly abandonment giving our lives away.
[time=3354] Father help us to pursue genuine relationships with the passion help us to risk the vulnerability and the and the sense of being known for the sake of others who would carry our burdens.
[time=3367] Father help us to have attitudes that are positive help us to choose to see what is right and honorable and good about our lives about this church about our place of employment.
[time=3378] And Father help us to pursue excellence in everything we do. Help us to be 100% kind of people. We praise you and love you. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3409] We've come to the close of our program. I hope you've enjoyed the music from our sanctuary choir, our handbell choir and soloist Read LaFavor.

[time=3432] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and I can say to you that I've sinned against you and I ask for your forgiveness. I ask you to take away from my sins and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
