[time=0] [MUSIC - 25 seconds]
[time=39] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=47] What is the purpose of the church in the 90s? Some say it is to provide fellowship.
[time=52] Others say teaching, and still others say the church's main function is to worship God.
[time=58] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore reminds us of what the Lord has called the church to do with a message he has entitled "The Great Commission." Let's now join our service.
[time=71] Would you take your Bibles in open with me this morning, the Matthew, chapter 28?
[time=77] Matthew, chapter 28, "I want to spend some time this morning talking to you from my heart
[time=83] about Blackhawk Baptist Church." There are some things that I want to say to us with respect to who we can be and who we need to be in the coming year and the coming decade.
[time=96] And I'm excited about that, the opportunity to share some things that I've observed and would love to see happen in our church in the days ahead.
[time=103] But before we do that, let me begin by relating to a rather humorous event that occurred in our school.
[time=108] The other day, Steve Longbreak away from the campus, and for those of you who don't know Steve Longbreak, he's the principal of our Christian school.
[time=116] He called into the school and issued the following directions to his secretary.
[time=121] Tomorrow, at approximately 9 p.m., Haley's comet will be visible in this area,
[time=127] an event which occurs only once every 75 years.
[time=131] Have all the employees assemble in the parking lot, and I will explain this rare phenomenon to them.
[time=137] In case of rain, we will not be able to see anything, so assemble them in the cafeteria where I will show them films on it.
[time=145] Well, I went from the secretary to Dale Wright, Steve's administrative assistant, and came out this way.
[time=151] By executive order of the school principal tomorrow at 9 a.m., Haley's comet will appear above the parking lot.
[time=159] If it rains, assemble all personnel in the cafeteria where the phenomenon will take place.
[time=165] Something which occurs only once every 75 years.
[time=169] Well, I went from Dale Wright to the faculty, and came out like this.
[time=174] By executive order of the school president, tomorrow at 9 a.m., the phenomenal Haley's comet will appear in the cafeteria.
[time=184] In case of rain in the parking lot, the president or the principal will give an order.
[time=190] Something which takes place only once every 75 years.
[time=196] From the faculty to the students, tomorrow at 9 a.m., the school principal will appear in the cafeteria with Haley's comet.
[time=206] Something which occurs only once every 75 years, if it rains, the president will order the comet into the parking lot.
[time=214] By the time it got home to me, at the lips of one of my daughters that came out this way, Dad, you're not going to believe what's going to happen tomorrow.
[time=222] When it rains tomorrow at 9 a.m., the phenomenal 75-year-old school principal,
[time=229] accompanied by his girlfriend Haley, will drive his comet through the parking lot.
[time=240] None of that happened.
[time=243] But it does illustrate the point.
[time=245] The well-known point that when something can be given very, very clear to one group of people,
[time=251] and then as it is passed on to the next group of people, it gets changed a little bit, and then the next group of people change a little more, and on it goes, until the original directions are almost undesirable by those who are finally trying to live according to them.
[time=266] And I want to suggest that that happens not just in a humorous anecdote like that, but it happens in the church.
[time=272] Christ was very clear when he gave instructions to the church as to what their mission was before he left and went back to be with his father.
[time=281] And from generation to generation, we can pass that meaning from one group to the next on,
[time=287] and pretty soon almost undesirable what he had originally said for us to do and to be.
[time=293] And so this morning, what you've turned to here in Matthew, chapter 28, is the original copy.
[time=299] This is the first order issued by the principal, if you will, to his employees, we the church.
[time=305] And it begins in verses 18 and goes to verse 20. Let me read these and remind you of this.
[time=312] And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.
[time=318] Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=325] Teaching them to observe all that I command you and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[time=333] The question we've got to ask and answer this morning is what is the mission of the church?
[time=338] Some people would suggest that the church exists as a place of marvelous encouraging fellowship.
[time=343] It's the place where we who know and love Christ come for refuge to be encouraged and stimulated and motivated in our Christian walk.
[time=351] That's the real mission of the church.
[time=353] Other people would say, "No, no, no, that's not it." The mission of the church is to teach the truth of the doctrine and the theology that the church stands on.
[time=362] And that's the real mission of the church to stand for the truth.
[time=366] Other people would say, "No, that's not really the mission of the church." The real mission of the church is to praise God. That's what we do.
[time=373] We're a worshiping body of believers and we exist for this great and unending purpose of worshiping God.
[time=381] Well, ultimately none of those are necessarily wrong in another themselves, but when any one of those or anything else becomes the mission of the church.
[time=391] We have lost Christ's mandate to the church.
[time=395] You want to know what the mission of the church is as given not by a previous generation, but by the author of it himself, looking verse 19.
[time=402] He says, "Go therefore and here is the, in the Greek, the imperatival verb of this verse, the command. Go therefore and here it is, make disciples of all the nations."
[time=414] That is the mission of the church.
[time=418] That is why we exist.
[time=421] The church exists, whether it's Black Hawk or some other church in some other city, exists to do that one thing to make disciples of all the nations.
[time=430] And fellowship, as a part in that, encourages us and builds us up so that we can do that better.
[time=437] And teaching an instruction in the Word of God calls us back to that and equips us to do that one thing, make disciples of all the nations.
[time=445] And we worship God because we see in Him a heart and a compassion and a redemptive power that is willing to reach into all the nations of the earth.
[time=454] In other words, everything we do, everything we say, everything we think, everything we are must be defined by this one mandate that Christ has given to the church, make disciples of all the nations.
[time=467] That is the one command in the Great Commission, make disciples of all the nations. He gives three participles in this passage.
[time=474] The first one is in verse 19, it's the word go.
[time=477] And what he is saying is whether you, it could have been translated having gone because the assumption is so clear that we will do this.
[time=484] But whether you go to some foreign country to do this as a traditional missionary, whether you go to some foreign country to do this as a tent maker, you're an engineer here and you become an engineer there and then there's your platform to share Christ.
[time=495] Or whether you stay right here in the city of Fort Wayne as you are going through your life, make disciples.
[time=502] Say, how do we do that? Well, he answers that for us in verse 19, go therefore and make disciples of all the nations.
[time=508] The first thing is baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.
[time=513] The first step to making a disciple in a nation is to baptize those people. You say, well, why baptism? Why doesn't it say bring them to Christ?
[time=521] Well, in essence, that's the point. In the New Testament church, when people would come to Christ, they would immediately be baptized.
[time=527] They would make a profession of faith and without hours, they would be in the Jordan River or some other body of water that, where they would be baptized.
[time=534] And so those almost became synonymous in the New Testament. What he's saying is when these people to Christ and bring them to the place that they're ready to make public confession of that Newfound faith in baptism.
[time=544] So step number one in the mission of the church is to win people to Christ and bring that sense of commitment to Christ to a place that they're willing to stand in front of other people and say, I am a believer.
[time=558] The second step is also in this passage, it begins in verse 20.
[time=563] Teaching them to observe all that I command you. In other words, what he's saying to these 11 are, I have spent three and a half years with you and I have instructed you in the word of God, the ways of God, the purposes of God, the mind of God, what it means to be a real live, vibrant believer.
[time=582] I have entrusted that to you. I have passed to you at Patan. You are now accountable. You are now, if you're going to be faithful to the mission of the church, going to go and win people to Christ and then having won them to Christ, give them what I gave you.
[time=596] Which would mean mature them into a place of strength and maturity in their Christian life so that they are now ready to fulfill the same man they'd on their life to go and make disciples.
[time=608] So if you want to boil this down into two very easy words to remember, the mission of the church is to make disciples how evangelize and edify the two ease, the two ease.
[time=620] We exist to evangelize the lost and to edify them to a place of maturity that they can evangelize the lost and edify them to maturity and on and on and on it goes.
[time=636] We've been talking about America the last couple of Sundays. We've been talking about our society and what is happening to the American mind, what is happening to the American culture and we have highlighted two kind of salient features of the American culture, one in abortion and two in homosexuality, not to beat up on people who have had abortions or to berate them but to clarify how far away that is from God's will for life.
[time=663] And to clarify into the issue of homosexuality, what God really intended for a man to have with another woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
[time=672] And we have seen a level of decadence in our country that is astonishing, it is staggering and we have the impression that we are at the beginning of this huge slide.
[time=682] We have feelings that the cultural climate of our society is going to allow us to slip even further in the next ten years.
[time=691] And it is alarming, but I come away from those two messages with two distinct impressions.
[time=698] Number one, and I don't mean to be irreverent in this, but Christ is my hero.
[time=702] I have a sense of real adoration and admiration and like, yes, go get him, Lord.
[time=708] I mean, he is the kind of Christ that would see a society and a people that are so depraved and so given over to their own selfishness that when they involve themselves in this kind of activity, he dies for them.
[time=720] And since I can free you from that kind of lifestyle, I can bring back, as Kareen has sung, a new beginning to your life with new purpose and new meaning.
[time=730] I can write what is wrong and I just look at him and I say, what in the world? That's the one I want to be like.
[time=737] And the second impression I take away from those messages, if there was ever a day for the church, it's today.
[time=743] If there was ever a day for the church to be strong and to be dedicated to its mission as Christ gave it to us, today is that day.
[time=751] We are the ones who will be able to challenge in unique and significant ways what Satan is doing to the people in our society.
[time=758] We are the ones who have the answers in Christ.
[time=761] We are the ones who have hope.
[time=762] We are the ones who can move into society and say there are answers in Christ.
[time=766] And we can say it with relevance and we can say it with meaning and we can say it in the context of genuine relationship and bring people to Christ.
[time=774] So I believe with all my heart in Christ and I believe in all my heart in the mission of the church.
[time=780] And I want to spend some time this morning calling us back to that mission.
[time=784] When I came here, I promised for the first 18 to 24 months to try to change nothing just to listen and learn.
[time=791] And though I am different from the previous pastor that you were blessed with, there are some changes you've had to suffer through just because I'm different.
[time=799] But it's been my mission not to try to tweak the system or to change anything but just to get to know you and to have you get to know me.
[time=807] But this morning I'd like to share some observations about our church.
[time=810] I'd like to challenge us in some areas and you may be frankly offended by a few things that I say, you may feel feelings of defensiveness coming up inside of you.
[time=821] And I'll say to you that I will take responsibility for that.
[time=826] But please listen to it and think through it and allow the Spirit of God to ferret that out for you.
[time=833] And what isn't right and what shouldn't be there then let's throw it out and what should stick and stay then let's hold on to it.
[time=841] But before I do that, let me answer a question that I want to answer and that's this.
[time=845] Russell, what do you love about Blackhawk Baptist Church?
[time=850] What really excites you? I mean, what do you really love about Blackhawk?
[time=854] You know, my answer is one word, everything.
[time=859] I mean that. I love everything about Blackhawk Baptist Church. This is one of the greatest churches I've ever seen in my entire life.
[time=866] I love the fact that we have 23 years of history in this city where because of your lives and the lives of those who have gone before you
[time=875] and the lives of our previous pastors have stood unequivocally for the truth unturnished by some moral failure.
[time=883] We have equity in this city because of you and your lives over the last 23 years.
[time=890] I love the fact that this church has strong lay leadership. I look at our elderboard and I look at our deacons
[time=896] and I look at our ministry team leaders and I look at our teachers and our ABS.
[time=900] And I see a group of leaders who love God with all their heart and are standing for the truth and are doing their best to raise godly families and being successful at it.
[time=910] That's a tremendous privilege and a blessing.
[time=913] I'm so thankful for our children's ministry that right now across the street we're ministering to hundreds of young people.
[time=920] We're teaching them and nurturing them in the scriptures and on Wednesday nights they can come and be a part of the largest a wanna program in the state of Indiana that's full of games and fun and music and scripture memorization.
[time=931] And that should families in our church choose they can place those kids in the private Christian school and have even more of that influence.
[time=939] And I'm thankful for our youth ministry that is building stronger every day to support our kids not only in our Christian school but in our secular schools.
[time=947] We're excited about the renovation of what used to be the chapel to a dedicated youth center that will be totally remodeled and decorated and the money that you've raised for this new building was also a part of that to redo that chapel so that they can just really be excited about welcoming kids that aren't a part of this church into an environment that is accepting of them.
[time=967] Or we can win them the Christ and mature them.
[time=971] I'm thankful for our music ministry every Sunday morning we come in here and get some of the best music going on anywhere in the country because of the talents and the gifts and the diligence of the people who lead us in that.
[time=982] The living Christmas tree and the Bible hour give us a presence in this city.
[time=987] There's hardly a person you can talk to in this city that hasn't been or heard about been to or heard about the living Christmas tree or hasn't seen the Bible hour.
[time=995] Constantly daily I'm stopped by people I've never met before and they say I watch you on Sunday mornings I get up at seven o'clock and while I'm getting ready to go to my home church I watch you I appreciate that Bible hour ministry.
[time=1007] That's a tremendous privilege to have that kind of presence in a city. God has blessed this church in that way.
[time=1014] I look at our facilities they don't get any better than this folks I have been in Chuck Swindall's sanctuary now mind you they weren't candidate me for anything but I've been there and I've been the Jerry Falwell's sanctuary and I grew up in John MacArthur's sanctuary and they can't hold a candle to what we sit in every week.
[time=1034] I wish I could take you all there and show you what we have this is just beautiful the way it's all done and the sense of intimacy and we can all be so close and to communicate together and worship God.
[time=1046] And I think about this new educational wing and as many of you have been going on tours were amazed how God has allowed us to build and to continue to have that kind of the facilities are just unmatched.
[time=1057] A tremendous resource for the cause of Christ I'm also very encouraged because we're paying our bills and I mean that with a sense of joy and levity in my heart the way we finish 1992 and now moving into 1993 we're actually ahead of traditionally where we would be in January.
[time=1074] We gave $7,000 more in January than would be our pattern in previous January the last five years.
[time=1080] That's such a relief, that's such a joy and I'm thankful that this church has a heart for the truth that you'll allow me to stand up here for example the last two Sundays and confront abortion and confront homosexuality and state the truth about it in absolute opposition to the thinking of the world.
[time=1097] I want you to know I have not received one negative comment from anyone in this church in the last two weeks instead I have received 50, 60, 70, 100 phone calls cards letters and personal conversations where you affirm me over and over and over again and say cut it straight.
[time=1112] Now that says something about you that is a blessing for this church but let me say at the same time that when a church exists for 23 years there are certain dynamics that begin to work against it when a church reaches the size of our church some 1700 people on Sunday morning there are certain dynamics that begin to work against that group.
[time=1140] And this is true of any church that would live as long as we have lived and enjoyed as much success as we have enjoyed and grown as large as we have grown and it is simply this.
[time=1150] There is a dynamic that wants us to turn inward on ourselves.
[time=1154] There is a dynamic that begins that makes us want to exist for ourselves, for our fellowship and for our families and for our growth and for our needs to be met and we can become ingrown without even really realizing it.
[time=1169] I have heard stories of the early days when we were across the street in two trailers and seven families and David Jeremiah met and you got to know when a new family walks through the doors of that trailer, family number eight.
[time=1183] You got to know some things happened, there was a buzz, there was a "oh my goodness" look at that.
[time=1191] I have heard stories of people being pursued, almost at the point of stop it, would you please come and be a part of our church, how can we get you to be a part of our church, how can we involve you in our church and give you ministry.
[time=1205] Well now we are so big, we don't know who is new anymore.
[time=1208] You know what I'm saying, those are just natural dynamics and we can become timid and we can become secure in our own relational network and lose the sense of the great commission which says we exist for one thing to make disciples of all the nations that says we exist to evangelize people and train them to obey all that God has commanded them so that they can evangelize and train them.
[time=1235] So that's what I want to say, I want to tell you how I discovered this level of concern in my heart.
[time=1243] Every Wednesday night our church puts out a prayer bulletin, it's a wonderful prayer bulletin, we need prayer bulletins and we need to be praying.
[time=1250] But week after week after week after week after week I would look at the prayer bulletin and do you know what 75 to 80% of the prayer bulletin was about?
[time=1260] praying for our own sick people, praying for our own sick people, is there something wrong with praying for our own sick people?
[time=1269] Absolutely not.
[time=1271] Is there something wrong with 85 to 75 to 80% of a prayer bulletin every week, the one major prayer bulletin that our church puts out being predominantly praying for ourselves and our physical ailments?
[time=1283] The remaining 15% were for the salvation of principally our own family members salvation.
[time=1292] So even when we are praying for the great commission, we're praying for the salvation of people who are related to us.
[time=1299] I then went to staff meeting after staff meeting after staff meeting on Wednesdays which I do and I saw that the prayer request listed on the sheet had the very much the same reflection.
[time=1309] The same thing happened in the elders meetings month after month. The predominant request was for sick people, something wrong with praying for sick people? No.
[time=1318] It's wonderful, we need to do it. In fact we're going to do it again today at the end of the service, there are some real needs in our church, I want you to lift them up to the Lord.
[time=1325] Is there something wrong if when our main prayer bulletin and our main staff meetings and our elder meetings and then I checked with a few deacons about what was going on in the ABS and what was the basic percentage of prayer time given to for us?
[time=1338] Or for reaching the lost? And I didn't sample everybody and yours may be different but many of the ones I did indicated that same percentage. Now what's the problem here? Am I saying boy we're in trouble because we're not praying for the lost sort of but here's the greater concern.
[time=1354] If you pray for what's on your heart, which I think you do, if you pray for what's really on your heart and if consistently up on those prayer sheets and in ABS and in staff meetings and elder meetings, if consistently coming up out of our heart isn't a request for the guy that lives on my street or the guy that I'm working with or the lady that I'm hoping to win the Christ.
[time=1375] It may indicate we've lost a sense of vision for the lost. It may indicate the reason we're not praying for them is because they're not on our hearts.
[time=1388] Now I recognize that some of these prayer requests are personal and you can't parade people's names around in a public form and I see some of the frustrations in that but I get a feeling that maybe we're a little out of focus.
[time=1400] I told you this is my bother some of you. How am I doing? Got off a quiet. All right, let's go to a couple of passages on these themes of evangelism and discipleship.
[time=1411] Would you come to me with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 5. Here we are told something about ourselves. We are given an identity.
[time=1425] We are described. The church is given a name and a sense, a job description. 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 20.
[time=1438] Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ. As though God were in treating through us we beg you on behalf of Christ be reconciled to God.
[time=1449] We are here given the job description of an ambassador. Think with me for a minute about what an ambassador does. An ambassador is one who leaves his home country.
[time=1459] He goes to a foreign country. The first order of business he sets up an embassy or a foreign office. He rents a facility where he can meet on a regular basis.
[time=1469] He brings with him or hires a secretary and assistance and staff and he furnishes the place with phone and desk and couch and lamp. He has now established his embassy.
[time=1481] But I would suggest to you that if he is going to do his job, if he is going to represent the interests of his sovereign in that foreign country, he must leave his embassy and interact with government officials.
[time=1496] And interact with trade negotiations. He must get outside of his own embassy to represent the interests of his sovereign in the people's lives of that foreign nation to which he has gone.
[time=1506] And if he stays in his embassy and if his interest and focus becomes on the embassy itself that we are filing papers well and that the floor is clean and that the staff shows up on time and that we enjoy each other.
[time=1519] If that becomes the focus of the ambassador, he is delinquent and irresponsible to his duty to represent the interests of his sovereign in the nation to which he has been assigned.
[time=1530] We are called ambassadors for Christ. We, as you know, are in a foreign land. This is not our home. We are citizens of heaven.
[time=1540] We are citizens of the kingdom of God by virtue of rebirth into Christ. We have a new identity, a new home, a new citizenship which transcends our American citizenship.
[time=1551] And so we, in the truest sense, are strangers in a foreign land. We are here but for a brief time and we are here to do one thing.
[time=1560] To represent the interests of our sovereign in the lives of those who truly inhabit the earth.
[time=1571] And I will say to you that the church is our embassy. The church is our foreign office.
[time=1577] And we have it well-deckered and it ought to be. For it is in a way a statement to our love of our sovereign. And it must be well-organized. And it must be clean. And we must enjoy each other.
[time=1589] But if we are going to do our job, we have got to go in and get them out.
[time=1596] 1958, Ambassador Park Wallen in Cuba when the Castro regime was challenging the Havana regime and that country was in great turmoil.
[time=1609] Castro's rebels went to an American-owned nickel mining operation on the north coast of Cuba and took hostage 12 American citizens and dragged them into the jungle of Cuba.
[time=1620] Ambassador Park Wallen at that time received one message from the White House. "Go in and get them out."
[time=1632] As I read the account, he struggled at great length with his charge as an ambassador. He didn't want to leave the embassy.
[time=1638] He didn't know what he was heading into. He was scared. He was terrified. He would potentially lose his own life. He would leave his wife and his children in the safety there but by himself go pursue his responsibilities.
[time=1649] That's a fascinating account. He left the embassy. He made his way. He didn't know where he was going. Finally found himself and face-to-face confrontations.
[time=1658] With Castro's rebels eventually made his way to the Castro's brother and unequivocally demanded the immediate release of the American citizens in the authority of the American government.
[time=1669] At which time the Americans were released and he took them back to his embassy. Now that is a picture of my friends of our ambassadors for Christ.
[time=1681] We are on this planet not to stay within the shelter and the comfort and the supportive environment is if that were the end in itself.
[time=1692] What we are as a church is to build each other up so that we have the bravery and the courage and the strength to go in and get them out.
[time=1704] Would you take a minute if you have a paper and a pen and take what I will call the ambassador's inventory this morning?
[time=1710] I will draw a vertical line on your paper. On the left hand side if you write down a few numbers that will help you come to, we are going to tally the number of hours that you spend in an average week on the following activities.
[time=1725] This is private information. You may want to put your hand over it. It is nobody else's business.
[time=1730] First number that I would like you to try to put down in an average week the number of hours you spend in devotion.
[time=1738] What I mean by that is time and the word and prayer. And I estimated for an average person maybe in a church 30 minutes a day, six days a week, comes about three hours.
[time=1749] The number of, if you don't have a paper and a pen and maybe in your head, that first number, how many hours I spend with the Lord?
[time=1756] In prayer and devotion by I will say. Second category. Second number, how many hours do you spend at the church?
[time=1764] If you come to the Sunday morning service and have an ABF, you are here about three, three and a half, four hours on Sunday morning. You may have some further involvement.
[time=1776] So maybe there is a number there. I put down three hours just to try to represent an average situation.
[time=1782] The next category I would like you to try to add up in your mind. The number of hours you spend with Christian friends, whether it be socially or for fellowship, but it is you and other Christians and you are having dinner together or you are going to see a play or you are doing this or you are doing that.
[time=1800] And then maybe any other ministry that you do that is exclusively with Christians. Maybe you are involved in a Christian Bible study, a ladies Bible study.
[time=1814] Now if you would just total that number there. For this standard sample I put three hours for devotion, three hours for church and five hours for Christian friends and other stuff, other Christian stuff, 11 hours.
[time=1830] That is part one of the inventory. Part two on the right hand side of your column.
[time=1836] Would you write down the number of hours in a given week that you pursue an unbeliever to represent the interests of your sovereign in his life?
[time=1852] Please don't include work. Even though you work with unbelievers. When you are at work you need to work and you need to work hard and you work hard with anybody else.
[time=1860] Now if you build relationships at work that you then take them to dinner afterwards or have them over for a ball game or go somewhere with them, count those hours but don't count work.
[time=1870] Work is a part of your testimony but it is not a part of your being involved intimately in their life. If you are in school please don't include school.
[time=1878] Take those hours that are outside of those normal things and yes that builds a foundation for your witness but take the hours that are in addition to that.
[time=1888] Somebody gave this survey to me about eight years ago. I think at that time I had gone through seminary, I was on staff at Grace Community Church and not counting my work but just to try to look at it from the other perspective.
[time=1904] I probably had 15 hours a week under the left hand column and I had a goose egg on the right side. I couldn't put anything down as far as a consistent commitment to move into unbelievers' lives to represent the interests of my sovereign.
[time=1926] Went home, I shared it with Heidi. We got down on our knees and we prayed to God. We said something's wrong here Lord. Something's not right. Help us. Help us. Get out of the embassy. At least at points to represent the interests of the sovereign.
[time=1946] He answered our prayer in a couple by the name of Doug and Melody Saddam. Doug and Melody were next door neighbors of ours and with the spirit of God working on our hearts on Saturday it began just on Saturdays as I was doing the lawn work and his lawn was next to my lawn instead of being in a hurry and instead of being in a rush to get my work done so I could do something else.
[time=1969] I began to be a little softer and slower and make it very clear I'd be happy to talk or chat and we began to do that Saturday after Saturday just learning a little bit about what he does for a living and where he's from and all those kinds of questions.
[time=1982] Pretty soon we struck up a conversation about a common interest that we both have which was snow skiing and we talked about snow skiing and where he's skiing and where I've skiing and what the latest stuff is to ski on and all the kinds of things that once you get into an area of common interest you can talk about.
[time=1997] Find me one Saturday he said to me hey Russ there's a brand new ski movie out of a war and Miller ski movie and it's over here at such and such a high school you want to go with me and Mel my heart was pounding I never done that before with an unbeliever I choked out the words yes.
[time=2017] Went in the house and told Heidi what I just committed us to and she said well maybe that's part of all this so he got the tickets we went there there were thousands of people at this war on Miller ski movie I'd never been to one of my life I've never been to one sense but it was a incredible event they just show all these crazy guys doing crazy things you've seen some things like that on TV.
[time=2038] A couple months later we went to dinner together and he ordered a beer and she ordered a glass of wine and we started getting sweaty palms.
[time=2051] And then he said hey you know what you guys want to go skiing together let me be honest folks Heidi and I had never gone on a vacation with anybody other than family or Christian friends.
[time=2066] We thought of actually getting in a car and driving somewhere with these people for three days was absolutely terrifying what would happen how would it work.
[time=2080] But we said yes we'll give it a try we didn't say that to them we said that to ourselves we said yes we'd be excited to go so he got all the reservations he got everything figured out we'd wrote up there in his car we drove from Southern California up to mammoth mountain where we love to ski six hour drive.
[time=2095] We stopped at five hours right at there's a little town below the base of mammoth mountain called Bishop and there in that town there's a sizzler restaurant we got in there we went through the kind of that line where you get your food and we sat down everybody had everything they need and then almost as if on cue he looks up and says to me Russ what's the true meaning of Easter.
[time=2116] Now kidding this is a truth scouts honor I'm not lying to you I was shocked I took me by storm I thought to myself what what is the true meaning of Easter.
[time=2132] I was I would flush suddenly a done on me that's the heart of everything that somebody lived and somebody died and rose again his name is Jesus and he died for our sins so I get to tell him the real meaning of Easter.
[time=2149] You see Doug was raised by a Buddhist his mother was a Buddhist he had no conception he had nobody he could ask he had nobody he could find out what is the real meaning of Easter.
[time=2161] I was unbelievable. So we get up to mammoth and I don't know man he takes me up to the top of this mountain the very most difficult runs the triple black diamond stuff called the cornice and I'm like shivering in my boots at the top of this and he says now just follow me and so we traverse across the sheer cliff over the rocks and then we come to this even worse thing there's more narrow steep shoot with jagged rocks on the side and.
[time=2190] He kind of looks back at me with this sadistic smile and then he disappears I say my prayers I say God this is for you.
[time=2202] This is your idea I'm up here as your ambassador and I go over the edge and by God's mercy I didn't break every bone in my body absolutely fantastic weekend we never had so much fun.
[time=2218] We come back next month guess who shows up in church one Sunday morning Doug and Melanie far back right hand corner they're in a little late and they're out a little early.
[time=2230] But then it's every month and they're not leaving so fast and pretty soon they're coming almost every week.
[time=2237] And then I get a call to come to Fort Wayne Indiana and I leave that church but my buddy Kelly bird picks up where I left off and now Doug and Melanie go to the church he pastors at Grace Baptist that's only three miles from their house church of 1700 people much like our own they come every Sunday.
[time=2253] And they have a rotating responsibility in the nursery that if you put your kid in the nursery you got to serve in the nursery so those people still unsaved still unconverted are serving in the nursery on their rotation.
[time=2263] And they hear the gospel as clear as it could be presented every week by the pastor there.
[time=2270] I got a call last week picked up the folks at hello he says hey Russell it's Doug.
[time=2277] I said Doug how in the world are you he says I'm great I said what are you calling me for.
[time=2282] He says you got to know where I was this weekend I said where were you.
[time=2286] So I was at Manath Mountain and they just got a whole bunch of snow and you remember that shoot that we went down I said yes.
[time=2295] He says I skied that all weekend long but I had to call you and tell you I was thinking about you.
[time=2304] See he misses me he he I'm part of his life now whether he likes it or not.
[time=2312] That I'm praying that he was going to come to Christ someday.
[time=2317] But as scary as it is to move outside the embassy as scary as it is to let your schedule be manipulated and out of control by unbelievers who have needs and where you really have to make an investment in their life.
[time=2330] And where you even spend your money to go on vacation with them and scary situations if that's what God calls you to do.
[time=2338] Be an ambassador for Christ. I want to challenge you today right now.
[time=2343] That if you have a goose egg on the right hand side of the ambassador's inventory that if we were to give the same message this time next year you wouldn't have a goose egg there.
[time=2352] That you and your spouse would have looked at your lives carefully and closely and said we must make disciples.
[time=2360] We must baptize people we must be ambassadors for the cause of Christ.
[time=2367] Let me give you four practical suggestions on being an ambassador for Christ number one.
[time=2372] Find common ground with an unbeliever.
[time=2375] Maybe it's sports maybe it's history maybe it's art maybe it's mechanics maybe it's anything anything at all maybe it's fishing maybe it's hunting maybe you need to join a club just so you can get a part or be around some unbelievers.
[time=2389] But find some common ground with an unbeliever.
[time=2394] Number two be the best friend that unbeliever has ever had.
[time=2401] Be more faithful be more honest be more supportive be more understanding be more available be more committed than any friend they have ever seen in their life.
[time=2413] Notice I didn't say be judgmental be full of of condemning words about their behavior I just said be the best friend they've ever had.
[time=2426] Which I would think as Christians we would know how to do better than anybody else because of our friendship with Christ number three pray every day for their soul.
[time=2435] Pray every day for their soul pray every day for their soul God open their eyes to Christ God make it make sense to them.
[time=2445] God help them to see their lost.
[time=2449] Principle number four respond to the opportunities that you get.
[time=2456] I promise you you will get opportunities there will be questions they may not be tell me about the true meaning of Easter.
[time=2463] But they'll come there be questions about you and your wife there be questions about your children there be questions about your finances there be questions about all kinds of things.
[time=2471] And respond to those opportunities maybe it's a book that you can give.
[time=2476] That will help them maybe it's inviting them to the living Christmas tree and having a meal with them afterwards maybe it's actually sharing Christ but you watch those opportunities will come.
[time=2487] And realize you're not accountable to make them come to Christ you're accountable to be there in their life.
[time=2493] And God will take care of the rest and that's in his time.
[time=2499] So that's the first thing the great commission make disciples how well number one evangelize being ambassador for Christ personally in your own life grab a hold of that I challenge you number two number two.
[time=2513] He said nice he said and teach them to observe all that I command you teach them to observe all that I tell you everything that I've taught you I want you to teach them.
[time=2523] Come with me to second Timothy chapter two verse two for a minute we're going to wrap this up pretty quick but you got to see this verse this is one of my most favorite verses in all the Bible.
[time=2533] Because for me it just it just speaks to me of the marvelous miraculous wisdom of God.
[time=2541] He is so in touch with reality I know that sounds funny but it's just amazing to see it in this verse look at this second Timothy to two.
[time=2551] And the things which you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses these in trust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also same thing is in the great commission Jesus said in his 11 what I have given you give to somebody else.
[time=2565] Now in this first for four generations Paul says what I have given you Timothy I want you to give to another group of people called faithful men who in turn will give it to another group of people called others.
[time=2577] We cannot be called the sacks we cannot believe for a minute that this church and that our Christianity and that our relationship with Christ and the blessings that he has given us are for us.
[time=2589] They don't they don't they aren't for us they are so that we can in turn give that to someone else where we become a conduit of divine grace and teaching and training.
[time=2601] There is a principle here that astounds me it is called exponential growth you see in this passage you're seeing one dimension of Paul's life one one spectrum of it as he gave something to Timothy and tells Timothy to give it to another and another to another.
[time=2619] But he was also doing that with a paffress remember we studied that in Revelation and the church at Laodicea he had trained a paffress and a paffress had evangelized Laodicea and Colossi and Heropolis.
[time=2630] This is happening in Paul's life and this is how it works. In other words you and somebody to Christ and you take the time to disciple them and build them up in the things of Christ.
[time=2647] And the next year because that person has been taught by you and instructed by you though yet still a new Christian you you both win somebody to Christ.
[time=2657] So we went from one to two now two to four. The next year all four of you win somebody to Christ we go from one to two to two to four four to eight and then it goes to 16 then it goes to 32 then it goes to 64 and I don't know what it goes to whatever that is 64 times two.
[time=2673] And it's absolutely explosive let me illustrate it for you this way I have four daughters as you know if my eldest two would come to me and say hey dad let's renegotiate allowance.
[time=2683] And I say okay you got two options option number one you get a dollar a week for 52 weeks option number two you get a penny the first day.
[time=2693] You get two pennies the second week you get four pennies the third on we go every week it doubles eight sixteen thirty two sixty four.
[time=2705] Which option should they take.
[time=2708] Well if they take the first they get fifty two dollars. You're not going to believe me I know but this is what you get if you take the second.
[time=2717] The allowance on the fifty second week not the cumulative total the allowance on the fifty second week.
[time=2726] Twenty two trillion five hundred and seventeen billion dollars.
[time=2734] I see those looks you're saying yourself yes he has flipped.
[time=2738] He is out of his mind. No I'm not it's a mathematical principle and those of you who are an engineer know that when or mathematics know that when you double it every single time it starts really slow but eventually it gets out of control.
[time=2753] Piece of paper this piece of paper is approximately one one thousandth of an inch thick I'm going to now reproduce it now there are two four eight sixteen will stop there.
[time=2771] I don't know how tall is this if I could do that fifty two times.
[time=2778] Seventeen million miles high this piece of paper fifty two times seventeen million miles high that's thirty four round trips to the moon.
[time=2792] You say man how did Jesus know that I mean how to Paul know that they didn't understand those things I know this is inspired you see God wrote this God knew that.
[time=2802] You take an average checkerboard how many how many book how many checkers on a checkerboard square anybody know sixty four.
[time=2811] If we place one grain of wheat on the first two on the second four on the next eight on the next sixteen thirty two sixty four by the time we're done placing these these grains of wheat doubling it every time we have enough wheat to cover all of India fifty feet deep.
[time=2831] That's true. You see what in the world does this have to do with us this isn't a math class.
[time=2838] All right let me show you if you're an evangelist and you can win a thousand people to Christ every day you'd be some evangelist you'd be saying hey Billy Graham your day is over.
[time=2854] I am here now right a thousand a day three hundred and sixty five thousand a year yeah we're going to win the whole world of Christ world population of four billion yeah you'll win them ten thousand years from now.
[time=2873] That's how long it would take to win the world of Christ at a thousand people a day it take you ten thousand years to win everybody to Christ.
[time=2880] If you do it this first says and this year you won somebody to Christ and disciple them so that next year you both win somebody to Christ and disciple them so that next year they all win somebody to Christ you can reach the entire world in thirty two years.
[time=2899] I know that's amazing are we going to win the whole world of Christ no obviously not the Bible is very clear many are called fewer chosen.
[time=2908] But you understand what this could mean to you into your life you could be a part of that chain of winning people to Christ and discipling them to win other people to Christ that will soon go completely out of control you will be able to track all the people that have come out of your ministry.
[time=2928] It will be mind boggling so I'm asking you a second thing this morning who are you reproducing yourself in I would say to the elders elders who are you investing in to be the next elder who were who out there which faithful man have you taken under your wing and begin to build an interest and cultivate the appetite for being an elder.
[time=2952] I would say to you husbands who have been married for some time which young man in our church do you have your arm around and are you are you carefully nurturing to be a great father.
[time=2964] And as he looks at the struggles in your own life and he sees your own failures but he sees your heart and he sees your commitment to you mothers who are you putting your arm around to some young lady in our church.
[time=2976] And you're praying for and you're investing it and you're listening to the struggles and you're hurting when she hurts and you're crying when she cries then you're giving her books that help her deal with issues in her life because you're committed to reproducing yourself in her.
[time=2988] And all of those relationships saying and it doesn't stop with you disciple you're not the end of all this we're doing this with you so you can do it with somebody else.
[time=2998] That my friends is the mission of the church. That is why we exist. I want to close with three specific examples of how I think that could happen here at our church number one in our ABS.
[time=3014] I believe we have one of the greatest ABF ministries it's one of the strengths of our church you guys get together you're having fellowship you're carrying you're nurturing you're being taught the word of God.
[time=3025] What would happen if you as an ABF looking at Matthew 28 verses 19 and 20 saying we must make disciples would take upon yourselves as your deacon and with your teacher and your ministry team leaders and say we are committed to reproducing ourselves.
[time=3041] And by God's grace in the next three years we're going to raise up a replacement deacon a replacement teacher new ministry team leaders and we're going to win enough people to Christ that we can have two of us in three years.
[time=3053] Well we have 16 ABS that means in three years we'd have 32 and if that vision were in our hearts pretty soon we'd have 64 and we need a whole bunch more deacons and a whole bunch more teachers and a whole bunch more ministry team leaders and there be all kinds of openings for leadership that we would all have to rise to the level to meet that as we pass on our faith.
[time=3077] I believe that can happen I believe that the people of this city are so networked with everybody else in this city we've got everybody from presidents of company down to every other echelon of employment in this entire we are tentacles reach everywhere in this city.
[time=3091] We can reach this city.
[time=3094] Second area number two I'm so hopeful for this and I hope you will be two this summer four men from our church are going to go to Russia.
[time=3102] One of our elders Dick Kelly and the chairman of our missions board. He'll probably take with him Bill Culp another member of our missions team and then probably two other elders who may not have anything to do necessarily with missions.
[time=3116] These men are going to go there with some money that's been set aside within our missions budget because of your gracious giving and support and responding to a challenge that's been given to us by send international and Bob Provost for this church to adopt a region of Russia.
[time=3131] Not a city not even a church a region.
[time=3136] We have the resources they are telling us as a church to put our arms around an entire region of people and the hope is that these four men will move in and out through that region meeting with the pastors and their churches as they're in little house churches here in little house churches there and come back to us with an agenda for Black Hawk Baptist church to impact that region for the cause of Christ so that will be faithful to the great commission to make disciples of all nations.
[time=3159] I learned the other day that for $10,000 we can build 150 seats sanctuary in four classrooms in Russia turn key operation.
[time=3171] Do you realize a church like ours we could build 10 of those we could build 20 of those we could build 30 of those.
[time=3181] We could have reproduced Black Hawk 30 different times in the Soviet Union in the next 10 years and in the process we could be sending our elders to train their elders and we could be sending our wanna people to train their wanna people and we could be sending our ED people to train their ED people and we could be sending our choir people to train their choir.
[time=3200] The only thing that stops us from doing that is desire. You understand that vision.
[time=3210] A longing and a passion deep within our hearts to take a hold of what God has brought us to the planet to do.
[time=3217] One last thing. ABF's Russia and then this third one. I wanna challenge you this morning to start what I call a great commission prayer group.
[time=3225] I know that's not a fancy name. It's not even a very fancy concept but I think it has the power to change all of us in significant ways.
[time=3234] A great commission prayer group. Get together with four or five other people that you invite and agree to meet with on a weekly basis for one hour and pray.
[time=3243] Not for our sick people. We do that other times. Pray for evangelism. Pray that God would let us win people to Christ. Pray that God would have mercy on this church and that his spirit would work in the hearts of the unredeemed of this city and let us bring them to Christ.
[time=3260] And then pray for edification. Pray that the people of our church, those who are already here, would have a profound sense of conviction of their own sinfulness and a longing for God and a hunger for the word and a love for the brethren.
[time=3272] And that we would grow to the place that we each one of us are reaching in to draw people to Christ.
[time=3277] I don't know what would happen if that happened. We could have three or four hundred great commission prayer groups start right out of this service.
[time=3286] And you would do that on your own and you would beseech God. God. We're not here to pray about my concerns and my problems.
[time=3293] We are here to ask you to let us complete the great commission that you have given to this church.
[time=3299] Man, I'll tell you, watch out. Watch out. We start doing stuff like that. Refocus our vision. Take the incredible resources that God has given to us.
[time=3312] Watch out.
[time=3315] Let me close with this one little thing. It kind of puts it in perspective. There is a legend which recounts the return of Jesus to glory after his time on earth.
[time=3324] Even to heaven he bore the marks of his earthly pilgrimage with its cruel cross and shameful death.
[time=3330] The angel Gabriel approached him and said, "Master, you have suffered terribly from men down there." I did, he said.
[time=3338] And continued, "Gabriel, do they know all about how you love them and what you did for them?"
[time=3344] "Oh no!" He said, "Jesus, not yet. Right now only a handful of people in Palestine know. Gabriel was perplexed. Then what have you done?" He asked to let everyone know about your love for them.
[time=3359] Jesus said, "Well, I've asked Peter and James and John and a few more friends to tell other people about me."
[time=3365] Those who are told will then turn, still tell other people about me. And my story will be spread to the farthest reaches of the globe. Ultimately all of mankind will have heard about my life and what I have done.
[time=3378] Gabriel frowned and looked skeptical. He knew well what poor stuff men were made of.
[time=3385] Yes, he said, "But what if Peter and James and John grow weary? What if the people who have come after them forget? What if way down in the 20th century people just don't tell others about you? Haven't you made any other plans?"
[time=3402] And Jesus answered, "I haven't made any other plans. I'm counting on them."
[time=3410] 20 centuries later, he still has no other plan. He's counting on you. He's counting on me. We're it. Let's do it.
[time=3425] While the Bible Our Message today was pointed directly to our members and friends of Black Hawk Baptist Church, I hope it was a challenge for you also to live for Christ and to be a witness wherever you are.
[time=3445] And the Bible Our Seeks to let you know that you need Jesus Christ as your personal Savior. If you've never accepted Him, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer. Why don't you pray it with me?
[time=3456] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3463] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=3474] If you prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision. When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3487] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or a copy of the series on Satan, demons and spiritual warfare entitled "The Christian in the Face of the Enemy" please write to the Bible Our 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
