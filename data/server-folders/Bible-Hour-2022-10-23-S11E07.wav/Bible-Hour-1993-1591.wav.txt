[time=0] You know, there are other kinds of storms, too.
[time=23] They're different yet similar, and these are the storms of life that we face.
[time=28] The difficulties, hardships, trials, suffering, some are stronger than others.
[time=34] Often, they catch us unaware, unprepared, for the intensity that these storms come into our life.
[time=58] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=65] Thank you for joining us.
[time=68] Associate Pastor Tim Tetter will be speaking in Pastor Morris Absence.
[time=72] His message today is entitled "Strength Through Storm." Please locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of 1 Peter, chapter 1, verses 3 through 9.
[time=85] Our special music today will be provided by the men singers quartet.
[time=90] Let's now join our service.
[time=95] The Lord that God in the midst of thee is mighty, is mighty. He will save me. We'll rejoice over thee with joy.
[time=113] The Lord that God in the midst of thee is mighty, is mighty. The Lord that God in the midst of thee is mighty. He will save me. We'll rejoice over thee with joy.
[time=133] He will rescue us all. He will joy over thee with singing. The Lord that God in the midst of thee is mighty, is mighty. He's mighty. He's mighty.
[time=148] Let God arise, let enemies be scattered. Let God arise, let enemies be scattered. Let God arise, let God arise.
[time=166] Let God arise, let God arise, let enemies be scattered. Let God arise, let God arise. In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, we have the victory.
[time=192] In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, Satan will have to flee. Who can tell what God can do? Who can tell of his love for you? In the name of Jesus, Jesus, we have the victory.
[time=217] Who can tell what God can do? Who can tell of his love for you? In the name of Jesus, Jesus, we have the victory. The name of Jesus, we have the victory.
[time=240] Jesus, in the name of Jesus, we have the victory. Jesus, in the name of Jesus, we have the victory.
[time=283] Let God arise, in the name of Jesus, we have the victory.
[time=298] Well, thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today. It's been a few weeks since I've had the opportunity to chat with you.
[time=306] I think the messages from Pastor Moore have been very pertinent on specific subjects concerning homosexuality and abortion, and many of you have written in for tapes, and we appreciate your response to those messages.
[time=320] Just a few weeks ago, Pastor Moore spoke on a series on demons and Satan, and we put them together in a series of four messages called the Christian in the face of the enemy.
[time=332] And you can receive these by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=342] We'd like to suggest that you send in a donation of $15 or more to help defray the cost of preparing this series of messages.
[time=350] Once again, you can receive them by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=361] One of the ministries of the Black Hawk Baptist Church, as you know, is the Bible Hour, and as we are a church that has a diversified program, from time to time, we like to introduce you to other aspects of our ministry.
[time=376] There are so many support teams that meet regularly here at Black Hawk Baptist Church, and perhaps there are some of these that, as we introduce them to you, you might have the need to get involved in one of these support programs.
[time=390] Our pastor has gone this week, but just a few days ago, we had the privilege of having a guest in here in our studio, and Pastor Moore interviewed this person who leads one of our support programs.
[time=403] I think this is a very pertinent subject that you might be interested in, and I'd like to take you now just to this interview, and perhaps this will be an opportunity for you to get involved in this support team.
[time=417] Now here's Pastor Moore with this interview.
[time=422] Today we want to talk about Panic Disorder, or otherwise known as Acute Anxiety, and I'm thankful to have with me in our television studio today, Ron King, who is a member of our church and a man who has a heart for people suffering from Panic Disorder.
[time=436] Good morning, Ron.
[time=437] Good morning.
[time=438] Tell us a little bit about Panic Disorder.
[time=440] Panic Disorder, numbers I've seen recently, estimate as many as one out of ten people in this country suffer from some type of anxiety related disorder.
[time=450] Panic Disorder relates more to the Panic attack, could also involve a Gorgorforbia.
[time=456] I guess a classic textbook example or definition would be a fear of fear.
[time=461] Quite often people talk about a fear of wide open spaces, but it's really more of a fear of feelings that people experience when they have the Panic.
[time=469] It's such a intense feeling of terror that they start becoming very fearful of how they're feeling.
[time=476] And therefore they start avoiding places where they may have felt that intense anxiety at some of the places.
[time=482] So they start associating the anxiety with maybe the place or the situation that this occurred, and therefore the avoidance behavior starts to develop.
[time=491] And it's not unlikely for a person to limit themselves at some point to driving or traveling.
[time=498] The classic case is maybe the 1% of the people suffer from this become housebound where they're so terrified and afraid of the Panic that they simply won't leave their home.
[time=509] That's a very small percentage.
[time=511] Most of these, the vast majority of these people are able to continue on with a somewhat normal sense of their being.
[time=519] But with a lot of anxiety and a lot of fear and a lot of panic.
[time=522] So if I'm suffering from panic disorder at some level, I'm going to become fearful of the fear that I experience when I go to certain places.
[time=531] Quite often that can happen, yes.
[time=533] And it'll be so intense that I won't really want to go there anymore.
[time=536] The person starts associating the fear with that place, maybe a supermarket or a high building or flying or driving.
[time=543] These are places where they experience this panic before and so they kind of associate the fear with that place that seems to evoke those kind of feelings.
[time=551] Now I know you're leading a ministry in our church, a support group. Tell us about that.
[time=555] We started meeting back in 1988. It's been almost five years ago, a group of us started meeting.
[time=560] And I guess the response to at that point I kind of hit bottom as far as the condition I was suffering with.
[time=566] And I was looking for some type of resource where I could recover from this and wasn't real successful.
[time=573] I came across a couple different places that offered some home study type materials.
[time=579] And so I decided to start our own support group.
[time=581] And we've had people, a few of us still continue to meet on a weekly basis.
[time=585] And we've also added quite a few new people to the group.
[time=589] We meet once a week for an hour, maybe 15 minutes. And I think for the new people coming in, it's so critical to really understand what they're really facing.
[time=598] They put a name to it. It is an actual condition that's recognized by the medical field. And this gives them a lot of encouragement, basically.
[time=606] So what day of the week do you meet on?
[time=608] We meet on Thursday evenings from 7 to 815.
[time=612] Oh, that's great. Is there a charge for that? There's no charge. It's a free seminar.
[time=617] There should be a Christian support group for people with panic disorder.
[time=620] That's run by our church. And really, you're the leader of that.
[time=623] That's correct.
[time=624] Well, that's great. Thank you, Ron.
[time=626] Just want to let you folks know that that ministry is available to you through our church.
[time=630] If we could help you with that, call Black Hawk Baptist Church, 493-7400. Thank you.
[time=647] [MUSIC - 217 seconds]
[time=874] What a great thing to be able to trust in a God who doesn't change.
[time=882] I know that I change. I know that sometimes my wife isn't sure how I'm going to respond to her
[time=888] because maybe I'm not in a good mood that day. There are sometimes, believe it or not, when I actually, I don't act out of love
[time=895] just because I don't feel like loving that day. And that's because I change.
[time=901] I'm thankful that we trust in the God that we don't have to wonder what kind of mood he's in when we go to talk to him.
[time=906] I'm thankful that when I study God of the Old Testament, I'm learning about the God that I served today.
[time=912] The God of the New Testament, he's the same yesterday, today and forever. I don't have to wonder.
[time=916] There's a consistency about his faithfulness that we can trust in and that is something to praise him for.
[time=924] I like you to turn your Bibles to 1 Peter, 1st chapter.
[time=930] I want to look in this letter and just learn some things this morning. Probably many of you can remember where you were and what you were doing
[time=942] when the storm hit last fall, a wind shear that came and plowed through the Black Hawk subdivision.
[time=950] I was upstairs in our standing at the counter in the bathroom to my left as the window that was slightly a jar open just a little bit.
[time=959] It had been raining a little bit, but a sleet was hitting against the window and also my attention was turned as I listened to the sound of air going out of the bathroom window rushing out.
[time=970] Now, in my logical thinking, I concluded that if air is rushing out of this window, it must be rushing in another window with all the rain and the sleet and everything else.
[time=980] So I set out on my mission to discover what window in the house was open quickly, surveyed the upstairs bedrooms, didn't see anything.
[time=987] I was headed downstairs when I heard the sound of the train engine. Some of you hear that that night.
[time=993] And I'm a smart guy. If I hear a train coming through my house, I did the only thing I could think of. I ducked, I fell with the floor covered my head.
[time=999] And that's when the wind shear at least the edge of it hit the front of our home and blew open the front doors.
[time=1006] And all kinds of debris, leaves, rain, everything just came flooding into our entryway and into the living room.
[time=1013] And I remember getting out, making my way down the steps, trying to fight against the wind on the slippery floor, trying to get our doors shut against and struggling against the power of that wind that came into our home, looked for an exit, found that little crack upstairs and just blew our whole bathroom window that the glass shattering across our back lawn.
[time=1034] And we didn't even get the full brunt of it. Other homes did. The mailies know something of the force of that storm. And if you drove down State Street that night or the day after, you saw the intensity of a gust of wind that came in blue homes apart.
[time=1052] We learned something of the strength of a storm when I was young growing up in Florida. I lived on the west coast and there were many tropical storms that would come our way.
[time=1062] And I remember one storm, particularly when I was in grade school, we had the warning that the storm was coming and the rain hadn't come yet, the severe weather hadn't come yet, but the wind had started to pick up.
[time=1072] And I looked outside the home and I saw the palm trees bending. And I thought, well, this could be fun. Now, if you know me, there's one dream I've always had. I continue to have. That is the dream of being able to fly.
[time=1085] I want to fly. There are still some times when I lay down to sleep. I can't sleep. And I just start thinking about flying. And it helps me drift off into that never, never land. When I get to heaven someday, you can blink from one planet to the next in God's creation. I'm going to fly there. That's just my dream to do that.
[time=1102] So I looked out and I saw this wind and it gave me an idea. And I went into the back closet, got my mom's umbrella, took it outside. And I figured if Mary Poppins could do it, I could do it too.
[time=1112] When my strategy was this, I started running down the middle of the road and I jumped, I'd leap into the air, open the umbrella at the same time and see if I could start flying.
[time=1122] Well, about two jumps and nothing really significant happened, but on the third try as I leaped into the air, opened the umbrella, wind actually caught my little body holding onto that umbrella and carried me.
[time=1132] And what seemed to be miles, I'm sure it was just 30 or 40 feet, but picked me up into the air and then plopped me back down again in the yard off the side of the road. And I quickly finished my experimenting with the wind for the day, closed the umbrella and ran home.
[time=1145] I had to experience something of the might and the power of just even a little gust of wind to carry me.
[time=1150] And in this day of media and video cameras, we are able to witness firsthand more than ever the power and strength of a storm.
[time=1158] We can see, played on our television screen, the might of a hurricane that sweeps along a coast or a tornado as it goes through town, tearing and ripping and flinging buildings and cars and trees this way and that.
[time=1175] Through our experience and through what we observe, we learn something of storms, we know that some storms are stronger than others. We also know that sometimes we're caught unaware in storms and perhaps you've been out somewhere and found yourself inappropriately dressed for the change of weather that takes place or caught out in a sudden gust of wind that threatens to carry you over to make you fall.
[time=1199] We've also learned to view storms pretty much as destructive in nature. Storms don't come and fix things, they tend to tear things apart.
[time=1208] If my home needs repair on the outside and I know a storm's coming, it's not my first inclination to go into the garage and get my tools and lay them out in the front yard and hope that somehow the storm will come and fix my house for me.
[time=1219] I know that probably the storm's going to come if it does anything that's going to do greater damage. That's the nature of a storm to be destructive.
[time=1227] Well I want to talk about a different kind of storm, other kinds of storms that are different yet similar to the ones we've talked and talking about.
[time=1236] These are the storms of life, the difficulties, the trials, the suffering. We know that some are stronger than others and sometimes we're caught unprepared for the intensity in which the storms hit us.
[time=1248] We're threatened, we're hurt. Sometimes we're even fearful that the storm is going to utterly destroy us.
[time=1258] Peter talks about facing those storms in 1 Peter chapter 1, look at verse 6.
[time=1265] He writes that down the middle of that verse it says, "Now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
[time=1275] Now Peter is writing this letter to a group of people who suffer simply because they call themselves Christian.
[time=1287] He's writing to people who live in a time that willingness to be identified with Jesus Christ would result in ridicule, social discrimination, physical abuse, even death.
[time=1297] This is the kind of suffering that these believers face. You see it over in chapter 4 verses 12 through 16. He says dear friends, don't be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering as those something strange were happening to you but rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of Christ.
[time=1315] Verse 16, "However if you suffer as a Christian do not be ashamed but praise God that you bear that name." These were people who are suffering because they were followers of Jesus Christ.
[time=1326] And yet here in verse 6 of the first chapter, when he refers to trials he refers to them in a very general sense.
[time=1334] He talks about all kinds of trials rather than specifically saying persecution or even tribulation.
[time=1340] He talks about all kinds of trials that the believers face.
[time=1343] And I think Peter in this letter provides us with some insight into how we can face the variety of storms that come into our life.
[time=1350] When the storms come we may struggle but we won't be defeated. When the storms come we may be swept off our feet but we won't be left lying there.
[time=1359] And when the storms come no matter how severe they may be we can find the strength to stand.
[time=1367] Let's just read this passage beginning at verse 3 through verse 7, "Follow with me as I read." Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In His great mercy He has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[time=1383] And into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade, kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[time=1396] In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials.
[time=1402] These have come so that your faith which is of greater worth and gold which perishes even though refined by fire, so that your faith may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.
[time=1417] I believe in this portion of the letter Peter is telling us this, Peter is saying that we can stand through life storms by clinging to two truths.
[time=1429] Now there are other things, other truths that we can look at that are worthy of holding on to but Peter refers to two great truths that we can cling to, that we can hold on to when we face the storms of light.
[time=1442] I'll just tell you ahead of time these truths aren't new, they're not profound, you're not going to go, oh my I've never heard that before.
[time=1449] These are truths that we have learned but we tend to forget and need to be reminded.
[time=1454] In many ways we as a church are like the members of a basketball team who come to practice day after day, learning the rules of the game and over and over again they rehearse the skills that hopefully will allow them to win the game.
[time=1470] And then the event finally arrives and they go out into the court, they face the opponent, they've been trained to do the job but watch the coach, what does the coach do?
[time=1478] The coach sit back on his coach seat and just glory in the fact that he has trained and taught them well and very confident that they will remember all the basics and he just quietly watches the game as they live out all their training.
[time=1491] I mean no the coaches I have seen are sometimes wildly walking up and down the side of the court yelling at the players, get that ball down there, pass it, pass it rebound.
[time=1502] And you think well my goodness a whole season of training he still has to tell them to pass the ball, I mean don't you kind of figure that out after the first practice or two.
[time=1510] But a coach knows that when the players are in the middle of the game, when they miss the struggle they even then need to be reminded of the basic truths that keep us going that are important in the game.
[time=1520] And if you'll allow me the privilege of the opportunity this morning I'd simply like to play the role of coach to remind you of the truths that you know already that we need to be reminded of.
[time=1534] You can stand through life's storms by clinging to these two truths, let me tell you what they are and then we'll talk about them.
[time=1540] The first truth is a truth of promise found in verses three through five.
[time=1545] It is simply this, my salvation will be completed though I don't experience it now.
[time=1554] My salvation will be completed though I don't experience it now. And the second truth that we cling to is the truth of purpose found in verse seven.
[time=1564] And it is this that my suffering has a purpose though I don't understand it now.
[time=1571] My suffering has a purpose even though I may not understand it now. First of all the truth of promise. My salvation will be complete though I don't experience it now. Verse six again begins this way it says in this you greatly rejoice.
[time=1585] Now what's Peter talking about? What is the this that we greatly rejoice in? Is it the trials? No. He's referring back to what he just mentioned at the end of verse five.
[time=1596] When he says that the coming of there's a coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time.
[time=1603] The coming of the salvation. The salvation that is coming that causes us to greatly rejoice. Now I ask the question what since is our salvation coming?
[time=1613] I mean don't we already possess salvation? Let's go back and look at the context verses three through five again.
[time=1622] He says praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. We're going to spend time this evening on the truth of that verse as we praise God for his goodness and his greatness.
[time=1633] Praise be to the God. Why? He says because in his great mercy. I like that phrase in his great mercy. You know if we got what we deserved.
[time=1648] We deserve death but here it says that God gives us new birth in his great mercy.
[time=1656] We really deserve nothing more than utter despair and hopelessness and yet God gives us hope. We deserve judgment but here it tells us that God gives us an inheritance.
[time=1671] He says he gives us a new birth. Living hope is giving us a new birth into a living hope, new birth. The spiritual life that God gives us is real.
[time=1684] A man came to Jesus one day his name was Nicodemus and said how can I have eternal life? How can I be part of the kingdom of God?
[time=1690] And Jesus said to be part of the kingdom of God you have to be born again which was confusing to Nicodemus.
[time=1696] He wondered how can it be that me a grown man can enter back into my mother's womb and go through the whole birth process again. Jesus said that's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about spiritual birth.
[time=1708] Jesus explained it this way. He said you know flesh gives birth to flesh. There is physical birth but spirit gives birth to spirit.
[time=1717] That gives birth to spiritual birth. Spiritual life. God gives us spiritual life in what the Bible calls a new birth and it's real.
[time=1728] In fact in many ways this spiritual life is of greater importance than even our physical life. You notice how Peter addresses this letter.
[time=1739] It's beginning of the letter Peter and Apostle of Jesus Christ to God's elect strangers in the world.
[time=1747] Strangers in the world. Now before we are made part of the family of God before that new birth takes place our identification is in this world. This is our home.
[time=1757] But once spiritual birth comes about once we go that process of new birth we're no longer part of this world. We're part of a new family.
[time=1765] There is a different place that is our home that is heaven and Paul Peter understanding that refers to the God's people God's elect the believers as strangers in this world.
[time=1777] The reality of spiritual life that sometimes we don't even recognize but it's real. It says that we are giving us new birth into a living hope.
[time=1788] The new birth is something that God gave us in the past. The living hope is something we experience right now. We live with the assurance that there is a life beyond this life.
[time=1796] Why do we have a living hope? How do we get that? It says through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[time=1802] Because Jesus Christ broke the power of death and raised from the dead. I have the assurance that there is more to this life than what I'm experiencing now. There is something yet to come.
[time=1814] And that gives me hope.
[time=1817] I know there are people that in testimony will say something to the effect. You know if all there was to Christianity was just this life that would be enough.
[time=1826] That would be good enough. It's reason enough to be a Christian. And I understand what they say but Paul had a different perspective.
[time=1833] Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 15, 19 through 20, said, "If only for this life we have hope in Christ. If only for this hope we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitted more than all men."
[time=1843] But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead. In other words, Paul was saying, "Yeah, there's a lot of good things about life."
[time=1850] But there's just a lot about this life that I just rather do without. And if all there is to Christianity is just what happens in this life, Paul says we're to be pitted.
[time=1862] Yet Christ is guaranteed that there is more to come. It's given us new birth into a living hope and look it to the future.
[time=1870] So what, into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade, he says, "kept in heaven for you." An inheritance that lasts forever. For who? For those who by faith are shielded by God's power.
[time=1884] It's talking about the Christian here. The person that is not a believer, the person who has not come to the place where they have yielded to the authority of Christ, person who has not experienced the new birth, does not have spiritual life, does not have this hope.
[time=1898] And not hold on to the truth that somehow, someday things will be better and different because their salvation will be complete.
[time=1905] It's only those who belong to Christ, who belong to God, who are shielded by His power through faith. And when do we get this?
[time=1914] It says that the coming of the salvation in the last time. Now we come back to the question again, "Well, haven't I been saved already?"
[time=1921] What is this referring to when it talks about the coming of the salvation in the last time?
[time=1927] Well, yes, in a sense we've been saved already and no, in a sense we haven't been saved yet.
[time=1932] I think too often we tend to look at salvation as an event that happens in the life of a person.
[time=1937] They come to the place where they understand the message of Jesus Christ and they yield to that and refer to that incident, that event as their salvation.
[time=1946] The Bible has a broader perspective of what salvation is.
[time=1950] We've seen the Bible that it talks about salvation as something that has happened in the past to us. It talks about salvation as something that is happening to us now.
[time=1958] And it also talks about salvation as though it's something that's going to happen in the future.
[time=1962] Salvation really, most accurately seen in Scripture, is a process that we are in.
[time=1968] Now don't misunderstand me and understand what Peter is saying here.
[time=1972] Your salvation, if you are a believer, your salvation is secure. Nothing can take that away from you.
[time=1978] In verse 4 it says that we have an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade.
[time=1985] And it says that we have a living hope that we are kept in.
[time=1991] In verse 4 it says that it is kept, an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you.
[time=1996] If you have a new American standard, this word kept is translated reserved and that's literally what it means.
[time=2002] An inheritance that's reserved for you, it's secure. Not too long ago, it was in the airport.
[time=2008] And I had about an hour layover before I was to catch my next flight and I was just sitting in the waiting area of the terminal.
[time=2016] And I noticed that more and more people were coming and you could tell that this flight was going to be full.
[time=2020] In fact, about a half hour before the flight was due to depart, they began announcing over the speaker.
[time=2026] If any of you are willing to give up your ticket, we'd be happy to give you a $200 voucher and put you on another flight.
[time=2034] I've always wanted to be bumped. I want to get those free tickets.
[time=2038] Pete Colby gets them all the time. I've never been able to get so I'm sitting here going, yes, here's my chance.
[time=2043] Also thinking, realizing that my flight is going to arrive at its destination about 30 minutes before I have to speak.
[time=2048] So I'm trying to think, now how can I work this out? Can I call in sick? Is that ethical to do that? Probably not.
[time=2053] But I listen. I sat there for about 20 minutes as the offer kept getting higher and higher and higher.
[time=2059] I think I could have walked away from there a millionaire if I could have just given them my ticket.
[time=2063] But the problem was more people had come wanting to get on the flight than they had space for.
[time=2069] And there were people that came without reservations but they wanted to try to get on the flight.
[time=2073] I walked on to the plane with my ticket, with my seat assignment, I sat where I was assigned to sit.
[time=2079] I reached my destination because my reservation was good.
[time=2083] We don't have to fear that someday we'll kind of come to the pearly gates, so to speak. And be welcomed by an official of heaven that says, well, we just didn't anticipate this, but we're full.
[time=2097] And we're going to have to send you someplace else. Because folks, I'll tell you the alternative to heaven doesn't sound that good to me.
[time=2103] And I would look forward to someone giving the message that, you know, we're just too full. The reservation is no good.
[time=2109] I have a place reserved and the person that guarantees my reservation is none other than Jesus Christ himself.
[time=2115] He told us disciples that I'm leaving and I'm going to prepare a place for you.
[time=2121] And he said an interesting thing. He said, you know, if that were not so, I would tell you. I wouldn't lie to you.
[time=2127] I'm not trying to make you feel good. I'm not trying to mislead you. I'm not trying to give false hope. If this wasn't true, I'd tell you it wasn't true.
[time=2133] But you can depend on this. You can hope on this. And I'm preparing. I have a place reserved for you. Hope of what's to come.
[time=2142] And inheritance that we will have. We are secure. Our salvation is secure. And yet it's not complete.
[time=2149] There is still an element of our salvation where there's more that is yet to come. God's not finished.
[time=2156] I may be free from the forgiveness of sin, but there's still the effects of sin that continue to affect me every day of my life.
[time=2163] And someday my salvation will be complete, and even that will be taken care of. There are passage and scriptures that talk about that.
[time=2169] Let me give you a couple of Romans 13-11. It says, understand the present time. The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber because our salvation is nearer now, is nearer now than when we first believed.
[time=2182] Our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed Hebrews 9-28. So Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people.
[time=2191] And He will appear a second time to bear, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for Him.
[time=2198] The future aspect of salvation, Charles Wesley understood it. The first Him we sang this morning. Just read part of the last verse.
[time=2206] Love divine, all loves its excelling. He writes, finish then thy new creation. Finish it.
[time=2214] Pure and spotless, let us be. Let us see thy great salvation perfectly restored in the process of salvation that is still at work in my life, and I have the hope that someday it will be completed.
[time=2230] Now, why is it that in my life when difficulties come, it is so hard to focus on that truth, on the truth of promise that someday my salvation will be completed even though I don't experience it now.
[time=2245] Why is it difficult to live in light of that perspective? Well, I know for me it's hard for me to accept what I have an experienced or observed.
[time=2254] And when I consider life, everything by my perception is measured in life spans. I have seen birth, I have seen death. And roughly there's a span of life in between that is 75 years or so.
[time=2271] And that becomes the measurement of life for me, the measurement of reality. I can't comprehend eternity. It doesn't make sense to me.
[time=2281] My existence is also filled with disappointments every day and disappointed by things. How am I supposed to live in light of a life that is perfect, holy bliss? I can't comprehend that.
[time=2294] This earthly life is the only one we really know. How can we live with a heavenly perspective? Well, it's hard. And yet that is the very essence of faith.
[time=2309] Believing and living according to what God has said, even though it goes sometimes against reason, even though it goes against our experience, to know that it's true and to live by it. That's in verse 8.
[time=2321] He says, "Though you've not seen Jesus Christ, yet you love Him, and even though you don't see Him, now you believe in Him that's faith." That's faith.
[time=2330] And yet how do I live in this existence with the understanding, with the perspective, with the focus, of the greater reality that's going to come?
[time=2340] I don't have all the answers for that, but there's something that helps me think about it at least. Try to gain some perspective in my mind.
[time=2346] Try to imagine yourself being able to go back into that time of your life when you were being formed in the womb of your mother.
[time=2356] And let's just imagine that you were able to go back and we're told that the babies, even though those stages of development are aware, they respond, their brains are working, they respond to sound, to motion, to touch all those things.
[time=2369] There's some response that's happening. Let's assume you're able to go back and to reason and think about your existence in your mother's womb.
[time=2376] That's the only reality you would know. The dark warmth of your mother. If someone somehow could send a message to you and say, "You would not believe what's out here, what's waiting you?"
[time=2391] The colors, the sights, the sounds, that would make no sense to us because all we know is the reality of the womb and yet there comes a point when we go through a painful birth.
[time=2402] And we come into what we call being born into the world and all of a sudden a new reality takes place and we begin a process of life where we become aware of this new life.
[time=2411] And we don't even remember that other existence, even though it was real. Now this is reality, this existence, this life.
[time=2420] But I believe in the same way there's coming another birth that's going to be perhaps painful. That is the birth that comes about through death.
[time=2429] And we will be born not into the world but will be born into heaven. And I believe that when we experience heaven, it's just like John trying to write in Revelation about streets of gold.
[time=2440] I mean, it doesn't make sense to us, but we will experience something that is beyond our comprehension now. But once there, we will look back and wonder why we put so much into this existence in this world.
[time=2452] There's coming a greater, better reality that God has promised for us. I want to tell you folks, maybe this seems trite because I've never personally been threatened with death.
[time=2467] But where I am now, when I think about dying, I am not afraid to die. Now the process of death, that's a different story.
[time=2475] If you give me a choice, there are ways that I might choose to die and ways that I would avoid if given that choice. I don't have the choice. But that itself does not frighten me.
[time=2486] I welcome it. And I hope God grants me the grace to embrace it when my time comes because I know the hope that I have, what God has called me to.
[time=2496] That's the first truth of promise that my salvation will be completed, though I don't experience it now. I experience disappointment, suffering, trial.
[time=2506] There's coming a day when salvation will be complete that will not be there anymore. I can hold on to that.
[time=2513] There's another truth. It's the truth of purpose. My suffering has a purpose, though I don't understand it now. Look at verse 7.
[time=2521] These have come so that and stop right there. Peter was able to write that these trials have come so that and he fills in the blank.
[time=2534] That statement tells me that there is a purpose in trials.
[time=2541] Now the Bible talks about various purposes that may be coming about in the trials that we face.
[time=2547] And first Peter, as in Job, the purpose for trials and mentioned is that to prove that our faith is genuine.
[time=2554] John chapter 9 talks about a blind man. The disciples of Jesus asked why is this man blind? Is it because he sender his parents? And Jesus said, "None of that is true. This man is born blind so that the work of God can be displayed."
[time=2569] Another reason might be to produce perseverance, character, and hope in us. That's what Romans 5 and James 1 talks about.
[time=2575] Second Corinthians 12 talks about God's desire to show his strength through our infirmities and weakness and struggles.
[time=2581] That might be another reason, or perhaps in Romans as Hebrews 12 says. It's to bring about discipline and training in our life.
[time=2588] Or maybe it's something completely different.
[time=2591] The meaning of our trials and our sufferings in the storms of life may be totally incomprehensible to us as they were for Job who has never given a reason for what he suffered.
[time=2602] They may make no sense at all. But the truth that we can hold on to is that there is a purpose.
[time=2612] If there's a purpose, then there must be a plan. Sometimes our children are playing down in the basement and things will get a little more and more physical.
[time=2622] Until we hear the cry of pain and one of our children stumbles up the stairs and crying because one of their brothers or sisters hit them.
[time=2632] So we'll call the offending party upstairs and ask the question, "Now, did you do that on purpose or wasn't an accident?"
[time=2641] And the reason that we're asking the question of purpose is that we wanted to find out is there really a plan in play here?
[time=2647] Did one of them kind of sit out and think, "You know, I'm going to hurt my brother." And they set out to achieve the plan and so the hitting or the kicking or whatever happened.
[time=2655] Oftentimes it's just a matter of accident. But where there's purpose that means that there is a plan.
[time=2662] And where there is a plan, there must be a designer, someone who's doing the planning and the comfort to the Christian is that God is the sovereign master designer.
[time=2673] And here's something that is difficult to explain, to understand, but the fact is clear in Scripture that even our suffering is under the sovereign control of God.
[time=2685] We don't have time to look at all the places that Scripture speaks to that. Let's look at a couple verses just in this letter.
[time=2699] Chapter 4 verse 19. So then those who suffer according to God's will should commit themselves to their faithful creator and continue to do good.
[time=2707] Suffering fits within the sovereign will and purpose and plan of God even though the suffering itself we look at and we say, "That is bad, that's not good," and yet God is sovereign even in that.
[time=2717] Now that doesn't always make us comfortable. To think about both goodness and severity coming from God.
[time=2724] We like to think of God in terms of goodness and love and grace and gentleness, but judgment and severity and discipline we wrestle with.
[time=2733] And yet the Bible is clear. Lamentation 328. Is it not from the mouth of the most high that both calamities and good things come?
[time=2742] Romans 11-22 encourage us to consider the kindness and stirdness or severity of God.
[time=2749] We're not comfortable with that because we have a difficult time explaining how a good, righteous sovereign God can allow pain and suffering. It doesn't make sense.
[time=2760] Why would he let people hurt? And I'm not here tonight to try to explain all the whys of that.
[time=2768] All I know is to the believer it can be our comfort to know that somehow it all works together.
[time=2777] There are people who just can't comprehend this and cannot accept this. They can't accept this kind of God. Recently about a month ago, I was asked to be part of a panel at a local public high school.
[time=2792] As a panel of religious leaders in the community and a group of students ask those of us in the panel are beliefs concerning the Word of God, the Bible, and concerning God himself.
[time=2807] And one part in particular is members of the discussion got around to the judgment of God, how God would judge in the severity aspect, the severity side of God, who he is.
[time=2817] The gentleman next to me simply made the comment. He said, you know, that's not the kind of God I worship.
[time=2823] It's not the kind of God I worship. You know why? Because he wants to worship a God that can be explained that he can be comfortable with.
[time=2833] We need to worship the God of this book, who tells us that God is great and God is good, that God is sovereign and is sovereign to all things work together for a purpose and plan that is ultimately right and good, even disobedience and sin and suffering work together under His control.
[time=2856] And to the believer, the sovereign control of God is our comfort, because I know that nothing can happen to me. Nothing can happen to me except what God allows.
[time=2865] And if God allows it, there's a purpose. Now I'm not trying to make a light of suffering. I'm not trying to just put some glib explanation. Oh, you're going through some great trials, but there's a reason for it.
[time=2877] There's a purpose for it, so just praise God. I'm not trying to be glib. I know suffering and pain is sometimes to have immense proportions that people go through great trials and wrestling with it, but still the truth still stands that we can have comfort and the fact that God is in control.
[time=2894] Perhaps one of the people that has taught me greatest -- the greatest amount of understanding in this area by her own testimony has been a woman by the name of Johnny Eris and Tata, many of you are familiar with her story, her testimony.
[time=2907] A number of years ago I was at a pastor's conference at Moody Bible Institute, and Johnny spoke. If you don't know, Johnny was raised in a Christian home, lived a fairly normal life, very involved in sports and very active girl.
[time=2928] As a teenager, she went with some friends to swim, and she dove into a spot that hadn't been checked out, and it was too shallow, and with one snap of a bone, her life changed like that.
[time=2940] From that moment on, Johnny Erickson was paraplegic. And at this conference, she just related the different explanations that people would try to give to her to try to explain the reason for her suffering, the reason for this trial that she was going through.
[time=2957] And no one's able to explain it. No one's able to really say why, but one thing she was able to do, or she was wheeled to that microphone, was to say, "You know, I don't know why, but I know who I have believed in, and I have every confidence that I am trusting in a God who is sovereign, a God who is in control.
[time=2978] And whatever his reason is, I can give myself to trust him." There's comfort to the believer because of the promise, because of the purpose, because my suffering has a purpose, even though I don't understand it now.
[time=2997] You know, when I think about these truths, some things come to mind, and let me just close by challenging you with a few things.
[time=3006] First of all, I want to encourage those of you who are not in the storm to be ready for it, to prepare.
[time=3013] All of us face trials. All of us face storms of different proportion, of different degree.
[time=3021] You need to be ready for it. You need to prepare for it. You need to be holding onto the truth is the standing. So when the storm comes, you're braced. You're ready. Otherwise, you'll probably find yourself falling.
[time=3035] I stepped onto one of those shuttles in an airport that take you from one building to the next, and these little trains, as you step onto it, there are benches around and poles in the middle of this little space, and I just simply decided I was going to stand, not hold onto anything.
[time=3053] And it came to an unexpected turn, and an unexpected swing of the cart, and all of a sudden I was sharing the lap with the person that was seated behind me, to my embarrassment, and I quickly stood up and grabbed hold of the pole.
[time=3064] What was going to be ready next time? I've braced myself. I was ready for the next stop, the next turn, so I wouldn't fall.
[time=3071] If you wait till the trial comes, if you wait till the storm comes, you'll be down, and you'll be struggling to find something to hold onto, to try to make sense of it all, how much better to draw close to God, to know Him, to be comforted by His promise, to be comforted by His purpose, to hold onto those truths.
[time=3088] So when the storm comes unexpectedly, you're already standing. My wife and I have talked about the reason why we were able to endure the death of our daughter, who lives seven months, and we watched her in illness, we watched her in suffering, and then watched her die.
[time=3108] And we've talked about why is it that we were able to go through that? Other people go through similar circumstances, and there's a great deal of struggle, of pain, of anger, and understandably so.
[time=3122] I'm not trying to say where it's some way better, but why were we able to go through that without that sense of despair and anger?
[time=3131] We both concluded that it was because God had already brought us to the place that we were trusting in His purpose, that God is great, God is good.
[time=3142] He's in control, and He will do the right thing, even in bad situation, that's even under the sovereign control of God.
[time=3150] So when we face that storm, we were already holding on to that truth, it didn't catch us unaware, and we were able to stand through it, prepare yourself for the storm.
[time=3160] Another thing I'd like to encourage you is that when you're being pounded by the storm to be hopeful, to know that there is something else,
[time=3169] get help from those who are standing if you've fallen, and when you're able to let yourself go from their embrace to embrace and cling to the truths that we've talked about and don't let go.
[time=3182] All of us need to see our suffering in the right perspective.
[time=3187] It's easy for us to think that the trial and the suffering we're going through nothing could be worse.
[time=3192] I mean, I've been through times when I've been looking for a parking place, and I drive around for minutes, and I think that that's a great trial in my life.
[time=3200] What could be worse than that? Until the next week I get a cold that kind of sticks with me for two weeks straight, and I think, "Man, this is suffering. What could be worse than this, and then I get the flu?"
[time=3212] And I think, "No, this is real." I wish I could go have the cold again. Now I'm really suffering in the pain that everything in my body is doing, and I think this is real suffering.
[time=3223] And then I break a shoulder, and I'm up laying in bed, not even able to sleep because of the pain, and knowing it's going to be two months, at least before I even get some normality to the movement of my shoulder again, and I think, "No, this is real suffering."
[time=3237] I'd rather have the flu again. "Man, I never want to have something like this." And then I'm holding my seven-month-old daughter, and I feel what she's gone through.
[time=3249] And I experience the grief of watching her breathe her last breath, and I think, "What greater grief and life can there possibly be than this?"
[time=3260] And yet others experience greater grief, greater trials. And yet, through it all, we can learn that God is above it, and that we can trust in a God who is sovereign and in control.
[time=3280] I sit holding my dying daughter thinking, "No grief could be greater." Yet I know there are parents of this church who have a bond with a child that grows over eight years, 12 years, 16 years, and then they lose that child.
[time=3295] And I think that's a greater suffering, a greater pain. I think what could be worse than that? And then I watch a husband or a wife who watches a spouse battle with the disease that takes them.
[time=3308] And I think what could be a greater pain than that? And then I have a friend who comes and says, "My wife left me to go to someone else, and that's worse than death because she chose to leave me."
[time=3323] She has a deliberate rejection, and I'd rather death had happened than to go through this. And I think, "What could be greater suffering than that?"
[time=3332] And somehow, if we could realize the greatest suffering in life, or somehow we were to be able to experience it, let me just tell you this, and again, I'm not trying to belittle suffering.
[time=3341] Our suffering is great, it's significant, and we will wrestle through it all our life, but somehow we could see the greatest suffering from the perspective of eternity.
[time=3351] If we could look back, I am confident that even the greatest trial would be described in the words of Paul, as he says in 2 Corinthians 4, it would be described as light and momentary trials.
[time=3364] I mean, Paul suffered tremendous trials, persecution, pain, suffering in the prospect of death, and yet he was able to write, "We do not lose heart."
[time=3373] Though outwardly, we are wasting away at innerly where we are being renewed day by day, for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory.
[time=3383] That far outweighs them all. You see, he saw his suffering in perspective of eternity, and he said, "So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but what is unseen."
[time=3395] For what is seen is temporary, what is unseen is eternal.
[time=3413] I hope you enjoyed the music today from our sanctuary choir and the men singers, and we want to say again, praise the Lord, he never changes.
[time=3434] The message today was from our youth pastor, Tim Tetter, on the topic of an encouragement in the midst of a storm in our lives.
[time=3442] If as a result of today's program, you know that you need to trust Christ as your Savior, just before we close, let's pray this prayer together.
[time=3451] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm so thankful that I have this opportunity to come to you and tell you that I've sinned against you, and that I need you as my Savior.
