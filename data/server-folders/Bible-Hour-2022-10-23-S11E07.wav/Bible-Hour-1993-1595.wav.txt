[time=0] >>Genesis 6 says, God says there, "My spirit shall not always strive with men."
[time=23] And so Revelation 6 brings us to what is the Old Testament calls the day of Jacob's
[time=29] trouble. What the Lord calls birth pangs, the day of vengeance in the book of Luke and
[time=35] the day of the Lord in 1 Thessalonians chapter 5.
[time=47] >>Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=55] you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us.
[time=59] The Bible is full of warning against the judgment of God, though the message of vengeance, retribution and judgment is not a popular one, it must be told. Today we begin a study
[time=70] from the book of Revelation that deals in the coming judgment of God. We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation 6. We will be looking
[time=80] at verses 1-8. Our special music today will be provided by reflection. Let's now join
[time=90] our service.
[time=119] [MUSIC - 214 seconds]
[time=342] (gentle music) - I can't tell you how happy we are
[time=352] that you've joined us for the Bible hour again today.
[time=354] I have three important points of information that I'd like to give you in a limited time.
[time=359] So I hope you'll listen and hope you have a pencil to write down some of this information.
[time=363] First of all, let me remind you that we're going to have Jeremiah people here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church on Saturday, March 27th at 6.30 p.m.
[time=372] You can call the church office for ticket information for this dinner and comedy theater on that evening.
[time=378] The number is area code 219-493-7400.
[time=384] And then on Sunday evening, March 28th at 6 p.m., we're going to have a quartet from Minnesota entitled The First Light.
[time=393] That'll be a great evening of music.
[time=394] If you don't normally go to church on Sunday evening, join us Sunday evening, March 28th at 6 p.m.
[time=401] And then finally, I want to remind you of the series of tapes on Satan and demonism entitled, The Christian in the face of the enemy.
[time=410] You can receive these tapes by sending a donation of $15 or more to the Bible hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Lane, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=423] Let's go back now to the live portion of our service for some more music, and then the message from our pastor.
[time=430] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 248 seconds]
[time=706] (audience applauds) - Amen.
[time=713] Don't you love on a group like that, just nails a song.
[time=716] Wonderful song and well done.
[time=718] Thank you so much.
[time=719] What a blessing.
[time=721] Well, let me invite you this morning, if you have your Bible with you, to take it and open to Revelation chapter six.
[time=729] And study with me or begin studying with me.
[time=734] Wonderful section of Scripture that really opens to us truth about the end of the age.
[time=741] And it happens to be truth about the judgment of God, the wrath of God coming to earth.
[time=748] And this section goes from chapter six, all the way to 16.
[time=753] It's a part of the things that are yet to occur, the future prophecy about the end of the age.
[time=760] And it describes a cataclysmic holocaust worldwide that has never been seen before by this earth and frankly which this earth will not survive.
[time=772] This is the beginning of the end.
[time=774] It's called the Tribulation Period.
[time=776] It's seven years long and it ends the day of grace.
[time=780] It is the ending of the day of grace and it is the beginning of a whole new day, a day of judgment.
[time=788] The day of grace is the one in which we live.
[time=791] Second Peter three says that God is patient, not wishing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.
[time=799] God is seen now for the last 2000 years since the time of Christ as having been patient with the world.
[time=805] And we don't know for how many more years, 10, 15, 20, 100, 2000 more years, 10,000 more years.
[time=812] We don't know how long this period of patience will go on.
[time=815] We don't know how long the tolerance of God or Romans 2 says the kindness, the forbearance and the patience of God will continue.
[time=824] But I can assure you that that period of time, the grace of God, the patience of God, will someday come to an end.
[time=831] And when it does, this is what will happen.
[time=835] This is the Tribulation, this is the end of that period of patience, kindness, forbearance, and grace.
[time=842] God said in Genesis 6, "My spirit shall not strive with man forever." And it might be best illustrated for us in the account of the flood.
[time=852] You remember Noah preached for about 120 years.
[time=857] There was a period of time where there was no judgment.
[time=860] Judgment was coming, but during that 120 years, no judgment, just warning, just caution.
[time=867] Just the prophetic word of Noah saying, you need to repent, you need to get right with God.
[time=873] You need to turn from your wickedness for judgment is coming.
[time=875] But eventually that 120 years, though the people in his lifetime didn't know that the timing of it, they didn't know it was gonna be 120 years, but eventually it stopped.
[time=885] And you remember the Lord Himself closed the door of the ark.
[time=889] And once the door of the ark was closed, there was no room for repentance.
[time=896] There was no room to turn.
[time=898] There was no way to get on the ark.
[time=901] It was just rain and more rain.
[time=904] In fact, 2 Peter 3 says that the heavens and the earth are being reserved by the power of the word of the Lord for a day of judgment.
[time=915] The reason we are not already gone is because we are being in reserve.
[time=919] We are being held for this great day of judgment.
[time=922] And so that's what's described.
[time=925] Chapters 6 and following.
[time=926] It really is 14 chapters of the judgment of God.
[time=931] And though there will be some really exciting bright spots in here, we'll get to look at the 144,000 Jews that are redeemed and are preaching and proclaiming the gospel.
[time=940] We'll get to meet the two great witnesses who are probably other than Christ, my heroes and the New Testament.
[time=947] We'll get to meet the angel that flies through the air, heralding the gospel to all the world.
[time=952] We'll see that people come to Christ in the tribulation period, that they are rewarded marvelously for their faith, though there will be bright spots.
[time=960] This is basically 14 chapters of judgment and wrath.
[time=963] And it kind of strikes a note of fear in my own heart.
[time=966] If we could cover a chapter a week, we'd be here for 14 weeks on this theme of the judgment and the wrath of God.
[time=975] That takes us to June, folks.
[time=977] It'll be summer by the time we're done talking about the wrath of God.
[time=982] And there is a hesitancy in my own heart.
[time=984] And though I don't want to be pedantic in all of this, I don't want to be consumed with details.
[time=988] I have no intention of throwing up detailed exquisite charts and timelines up on the screen.
[time=994] I don't want to immerse us into extravagant explanations of imagery that we'll find inside.
[time=1000] I want to stay with the big major themes of this book.
[time=1005] I also don't want this time to be, in the heart of the preacher, an angry, vindictive, vengeful, kind of pulpit, pounding, fire
[time=1014] and brimstone series of messages where we all feel scorched at the end of every hour.
[time=1020] But still, to stay on the theme, as we will need to, for a number of weeks, in my mind, demanded some justification.
[time=1026] And so I have six reasons this morning why I think it's worth our time as a church to spend extended periods of time thinking about a theme such as judgment.
[time=1036] In a day when most preachers are seeking to be as positive and as affirming and as comforting as possible, let me give you six reasons.
[time=1045] First, Paul says over in the book of Acts that he to the saints at Ephesus did not shrink from preaching the whole council of God.
[time=1052] There is a responsibility to do that.
[time=1054] And this is a part of the whole council of God.
[time=1056] There is in the Old Testament and the New Testament an enormous amount of the word of God which is devoted to warning a coming judgment.
[time=1065] And so to be faithful to that charge, we will work our way through these chapters.
[time=1069] Secondly, we must learn from the Old Testament prophets, men of God, who were faithful in their commissioning and calling before God to speak to the people, the message that God had given them.
[time=1079] And oftentimes, more often than not, it was a message of judgment and a message of warning.
[time=1083] And like Jeremiah, though, doing it with tears, the weeping prophet, but faithful still to preach, all that God would have given them to preach.
[time=1092] Thirdly, we find in the life of Christ great support to spend time talking about the judgment of God.
[time=1099] It may interest you to know that Jesus Christ spent more time warning people about hell than he did telling them about heaven.
[time=1107] Jesus spent more time warning people about hell than he did telling them about heaven.
[time=1113] If you were to take a red pin as I have done and read through the book of Matthew and underline every verse where Jesus talks about hell
[time=1123] the gnashing of teeth, the eternal punishment, the destruction, the departs from me, I never knew you.
[time=1129] All of those references to hell, you would find 16 of them in total.
[time=1134] The Lord, because of his compassion and his heart and his love for people, didn't shrink from the responsibility to warn them of a coming day of wrath and judgment.
[time=1144] Fourthly, the Holy Spirit, by the words of our own Lord, in John 168 has come.
[time=1151] It says, "When he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment." Sin and righteousness and judgment.
[time=1161] And so it is consistent with the ministry of the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, in this time, to the New Testament church to give attention and to focus on the theme of judgment.
[time=1171] Fifth would be the words of Paul, when in 2 Corinthians 5, 11, he said this, knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.
[time=1182] There is reason to look at the hard parts of Scripture, the judgment parts of Scripture, because in looking at them, we are reminded and we see very clearly the wrath of God to come and therefore the terror of the Lord that is coming.
[time=1196] And that served in Paul's life as a great motivator to win people to Christ, not just that he loved those people and not just that he loved Christ and that love would compel him, 2 Corinthians 5, but also this terror of the Lord, knowing that it's coming.
[time=1211] Looking past the thin veneer of people's lives and the circumstances which say all is well and knowing the wrath to come and looking at them for what really is their lot in life without Christ to suffer the consequences possibly of the tribulation and then certainly of hell.
[time=1228] It's a wonderful account of Paul in Acts chapter 24.
[time=1233] And he is before a man by the name of Felix and Felix was the governor of Judea and an ungodly man.
[time=1239] He had stolen another man's wife.
[time=1241] Her name was Drosilla and he had taken her from another man.
[time=1244] He was immoral and ungodly and expedient and a pragmatist and without virtue and without character.
[time=1250] And Paul knew it and Paul was in his court on trial for his life, his life hung in the balance.
[time=1257] Do you know what he was discussing with Felix?
[time=1260] It says there he was discussing righteousness, self-control and judgment.
[time=1267] What a message for a guy that lived the life of Felix.
[time=1272] Let me talk to you about righteousness and let me talk to you about self-control, your ability to control your life and conform to the standard of righteousness.
[time=1281] And now Felix, let me talk to you about what happens when you don't, judgment awaits.
[time=1286] And there is one other and we might turn there.
[time=1290] Keep your finger here in Revelation and come with me to 1 Thessalonians chapter five, just for a brief moment.
[time=1296] This is a passage that also describes the coming of the Lord, the day of the Lord.
[time=1302] Paul is giving it and he explains some of the reason why the preacher should teach, not just for the unbeliever, but also for the believer.
[time=1311] 1 Thessalonians chapter five, it begins in verse one, of course, he's talking about the times and the epics, verse three, they'll be saying peace and safety, but destruction will come upon them.
[time=1323] But verse eight, he says, but since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.
[time=1334] Verse nine, for God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1340] In other words, we're not gonna go through the tribulation, we who know Christ, he hasn't destined us for this great judgment.
[time=1346] Verse 10, who died for us that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him, then verse 11, therefore encourage one another and build up one another just as you also are doing, for the believer, back to Revelation 6, for the believer, those of us who know Christ, the study of this enormous time of wrath and judgment and vengeance and retribution stands as an encouragement to us.
[time=1371] And we can encourage each other that we don't go through that, that God has not destined us for the day of wrath, the day of the Lord.
[time=1379] And so maybe if you've jotted these down about May, you could take it back out and reflect, oh that's why we're still talking about the judgment of God.
[time=1387] These are the reasons, I remember now.
[time=1390] And if those aren't enough, maybe the book of Revelation itself would be enough.
[time=1394] It is the only book in the Old and the New Testament that begins with a promise of blessing and ends with a promise of blessing.
[time=1400] It is the book of Revelation alone that says in chapter 1 verse 3, "And blessed is He who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, the one who reads, that's the preacher, the one who hears, that's the folks in the congregation, and all of us together would heed the things which are written in it for the time is near." God, Christ himself, has promised both at the beginning and the end of the book, great blessing for those who would not only read it, but hear it and heed it.
[time=1429] And so I am encouraged, in my own heart, to embark on a series of study that will take some time all about what is typically the negative, the discouraging, the overwhelming sense of God's judgment and wrath.
[time=1443] And I would invite you to join me in this, not just by your physical presence, but by joining me in your heart and in your mind to learn and explore the things that God would teach you and show you as you expose yourself to this teaching on the wrath of God, the judgment of God.
[time=1464] With Revelation 6, we begin the discussion of a seven-year period, and I want to give a bit of an overview to it.
[time=1472] It is the tribulation.
[time=1474] It is the time in which Christ will not only judge the ungodly, but He will take back the earth.
[time=1480] And you remember what brought us to Revelation 6.
[time=1482] It was in chapter 4 that we saw God enthroned on His great majestic throne from which peals of thunder and flashes of lightning were exploding, and it was on a crystal sea, and the angels were worshipping, and the redeemed church already raptured, was there worshipping Him.
[time=1497] And to give us a sense of what was happening, God is described in human terms as if He had a hand, then He stretches out His hand, that in His hand sits a little scroll with seven seals.
[time=1507] And we said that is the title D to the earth.
[time=1510] That is God's rightful title D to the earth, and Christ is the one.
[time=1516] Though John wondering who would take it, the question is heralded, who would be worthy to take the scroll, and no one is found in heaven on earth, under the earth, in the earth, nowhere as there one worthy, and so He begins to weep.
[time=1526] Uncontrollably, for fear that no one will be sufficient to take the earth back from Satan, take it back from death, and from sin, and redeem the thing completely, and totally, and so He weeps.
[time=1537] And then He's told a look behind Him, that the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, the lamb of God, the arneost, the little lamb, who was slain but standing, crucified but resurrected.
[time=1550] It's the glorious, resurrected living Jesus Christ.
[time=1554] And all heaven breaks out into this great pay-on of praise, and not only heaven, but all the creatures in earth, and on the earth, and under the earth, because it was He who took out of the right hand of God the scroll.
[time=1566] And it is this scroll with its seven seals that now we begin to understand as in chapter six and following Christ breaks the first seal, and we read what is there.
[time=1577] And then He'll break the next, and the next, and the next until all seven seals are broken.
[time=1584] The first three and a half years,
[time=1590] typically the tribulation is divided into two parts, because that's how our Lord looked at it.
[time=1596] In Matthew 24, He talked about the beginning of birth pains, and that was the first three and a half years of this judgment.
[time=1602] And it's for us seals one through five, which we'll look at here.
[time=1606] But this time is descriptive of natural disaster.
[time=1612] The second three and a half years, it is supernatural disaster.
[time=1617] There's a great shift.
[time=1618] And what happens in the middle is what they call the abomination of desolation.
[time=1622] That's the antichrist, that's a human person who has empowered by Satan himself.
[time=1628] And he becomes a world leader, and midway through this seven year period, he goes to the temple in Jerusalem, and he desecrates the temple.
[time=1636] He sets himself up as God, and says, I am the one to be worshiped.
[time=1640] And that is the midpoint in the tribulation.
[time=1642] What happens prior to that is natural destruction, what happens after that is supernatural destruction.
[time=1647] But the Lord uses a wonderful term for the first three and a half years, and it's birth pains.
[time=1652] The term that the Lord gives for the second three and a half is called the great tribulation.
[time=1659] The birth pains begin it, and really the birth pains run underneath all the way through, and it's a wonderful analogy, as only our Lord could teach and communicate.
[time=1667] Think about birth pains with me for a moment, those of you who have had children, and for those of us who have watched you have children.
[time=1673] Never forget that with my wife.
[time=1676] Watching those birth pains kind of begin quietly and subtly, and there is not excruciating pain, it's unavoidable, it's definitely there, and then there's a long pause, and then another one comes.
[time=1689] But as time goes by, the pain becomes far more intense, and the duration between the pain shortens itself up, and that is exactly the picture of the tribulation.
[time=1700] There will be beginning pains, and they will be somewhat painful, and they will be separated in time, but eventually they'll begin to hit in rapid fire and rapid succession, and the pain will intensify and escalate till it is absolutely unbearable.
[time=1715] And what comes at the end of birth pains?
[time=1716] The great event, a birth in human terms, a baby, but in terms of the tribulation and the picture that Christ is picturing, the great event is not the birth of a baby, it's the coming of Christ himself, and he will come at the end of that period.
[time=1730] And so he is the great one that is expected, he is the great event.
[time=1734] So it is a seven-year delivery process.
[time=1738] It is a seven-year time of birth pains, and it anticipates and culminates not in the birth of a baby, but the birth of a king.
[time=1747] The first three and a half years called the beginning birth pains by our Lord in Matthew 24/8, then the abomination of desolation, and then this great tribulation, as he called it, in Matthew 24/21, which when we're finished with that, the event of Christ himself.
[time=1762] The first three and a half years are described for you here
[time=1770] in Revelation six.
[time=1774] In chapter six verse two there are four horsemen described.
[time=1779] The first is on a white horse, and we'll talk about him in detail in a minute.
[time=1784] The second is a red horse in verse four, and he brings war, a great time of war.
[time=1790] The third horse is pictured for us in verses five and six.
[time=1795] He is a black horse, and he brings famine.
[time=1801] And the fourth horse is in verses seven and eight, and he is an ashen horse, and he brings pestilence.
[time=1810] So as I said, those are the first birth pains, those are the first three and a half years, and all of those are just natural causes.
[time=1819] What eventually comes though in the second half is this great devastation intensifies, and dramatically changes the character of the earth.
[time=1826] The third of the earth burns up in the second three and a half years.
[time=1830] A third of the ocean, and all of the creatures in the ocean, and all of the ships on the ocean are destroyed in the second three and a half years.
[time=1839] A third of the sun and the moon are darkened, supernatural phenomena.
[time=1845] Satan in the second three and a half years is given a key,
[time=1851] and he takes the key down to what they call the pit, described in Jude, where there are demons locked up there who have not been accessible to the human race since, prior to the flood.
[time=1864] A whole host of demons are there, and Satan finally gets the key, and he unlocks the key, and flooding out of this pit comes a demonic host that are best described as scorpions, and they have the power to sting, and hurt, and afflict, though they cannot kill.
[time=1879] And also in the second three and a half years, Satan rallies an army of some 200 million.
[time=1888] And we don't know, the Bible isn't sufficiently clear, whether or not it is an army of actual just humans, or if it's demons, or if it's demon possessed humans, but it is this vast army that assembles, not at the, not at the Armageddon battle.
[time=1903] This is prior to that, and they will kill a third of the earth's population.
[time=1907] So it is a second three and a half years of supernatural destruction.
[time=1914] And as we have been taught, it is a period of chaos, of natural disaster, of escalating war and crime, all the earth is on this fast slide to destruction.
[time=1926] But it doesn't start that way.
[time=1929] It doesn't start that way at all.
[time=1933] There is first a calm before the storm, and we can see that in the first two verses of Revelation six.
[time=1940] Follow along as I read.
[time=1941] And I saw when the lamb broke one of the seven seals,
[time=1947] and I heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder, come.
[time=1952] And I looked and behold a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.
[time=1964] What's going on here?
[time=1967] Well, let's just spend a minute trying to understand some of the descriptive phrasing here.
[time=1971] First of all, it's a white horse, and that of course is the horse of a great conqueror.
[time=1975] It's the horse of a victory.
[time=1976] It's the horse that kings and great generals would ride in their victory parade, as they would come back with all the spoils of war, and the men they had taken prisoner, and possibly the other king himself, and they would parade through the great city they would return to, and he would be riding upon his noble steed, and it would be white, and he would be the victor.
[time=1996] So this horse's color indicates a victory, and it indicates great accomplishment.
[time=2001] As does the crown that you'll notice has been given to him.
[time=2005] There are two crowns described in the New Testament, two different Greek words to describe the crowns.
[time=2010] One is a diadem in the Greek, the word is diadem, and it is a crown by virtue of your lineage.
[time=2016] You have royal blood, and when your father dies, you become the king, and you get the crown, the diadem.
[time=2022] The other crown is a stefanos, a stefanos,
[time=2028] and that is not a crown you get by virtue of having the right lineage.
[time=2031] It is one you must win.
[time=2032] It is one you must conquer to receive.
[time=2036] It was used in the games, the Olympic games of old, and when the athlete would compete and would win, they would crown him with a stefanos, a wreath to acknowledge his victory.
[time=2046] And that is the crown here.
[time=2048] It is a stefanos that this, the writer of this white horse wears, it is not given to him by his lineage, it is given to him because he is a great conqueror, and he is conquered.
[time=2057] But interestingly, notice in verse two, I looked and behold a white horse, and he sat on it, had a bow, but what is missing?
[time=2067] His arrows are missing.
[time=2071] He has just a bow without arrows.
[time=2074] And so we believe, and I'll try to support this for you in a minute, we believe that this describes a peaceful conquering, a conquering by peace and for peace.
[time=2084] It is an ideological victory, it is a political victory, it is a victory without weapon, without warfare, without bloodshed, without destruction of human life.
[time=2092] It is a worldwide peace that comes upon the earth as Christ opens the first seal.
[time=2099] You say, Russell, why do you think that's true?
[time=2102] Well, a number of reasons.
[time=2105] The passage we looked at in 1 Thessalonians 5, who remember that people are saying peace, peace and safety.
[time=2110] It is while they're crying out peace and safety that destruction will come upon them.
[time=2115] So the beginning of this tribulation period, people have a false sense of assurance, people have a false sense of peace.
[time=2123] I also believe that this first seal describes a time of worldwide peace because Daniel 927 says that the Antichrist will make a pact with Israel for peace.
[time=2133] And it seems there, he is representing the other nations of the world.
[time=2137] It seems as though the Antichrist has come to a position of power where he can speak for the other nations of the world and grant to Israel a pact of peace.
[time=2146] And so the world seems to be at peace.
[time=2150] The calm before the store, Utopia has come at last, worldwide harmony, worldwide cooperation.
[time=2158] No more wars, no more terrorism, one great colossal, global community of harmony.
[time=2165] That's where it starts.
[time=2169] You say, how in the world would that ever happen?
[time=2172] The world has never seen peace like that.
[time=2174] The world has never been at peace with itself.
[time=2176] There have always been nations at war with other nations.
[time=2179] There have always been peoples at wars with other peoples.
[time=2181] What would bring you to the notion that this world could ever come to a place of worldwide peace?
[time=2189] Somebody once said the only time this world is known peace is when it was stopping to reload.
[time=2194] Then that's true of history.
[time=2197] Well, just think with me for a minute.
[time=2202] I mean, maybe there are things already in place in our world today that would call us to or lead us to a day of world peace.
[time=2210] As you know, the world gets smaller by the second.
[time=2215] We know today things about other nations and other parts of the world in immediate response to its occurring there that we have never known before.
[time=2222] The whole vehicle of satellite television and all that that represents.
[time=2227] The facts machines, the traveled by jet aircraft.
[time=2230] They, as you know, shrink us to what they call the global village.
[time=2234] We are all a part of each other.
[time=2236] We all share each other's problems.
[time=2238] We are no longer isolated as the ancients were or even as people 100 years ago were in this country from the other nations of the world.
[time=2246] We all watched the same war at the same time on the same television station in the Gulf Conflict.
[time=2252] That never happened before in the history of the world.
[time=2254] It posed difficulties for military confidentiality.
[time=2258] And Bush at that time really was the spokesman for this new era.
[time=2263] He kept talking about a new era full of promise, a time of peace for all peoples.
[time=2269] He was calling us to resist aggressions or it will destroy our freedoms.
[time=2272] And if you will remember, his first efforts were to work through the United Nations to somehow put pressure on this other nation without bloodshed, without war, saying the real way to solve the world's problems today are not with military might.
[time=2286] They are through the various strategies that nations in coalition with each other can force peace.
[time=2292] Because of economic concerns and food and fuel and just the raw necessity to live.
[time=2297] Because nations are now so interdependent upon each other.
[time=2300] Gorbachev spoke, and I quote, of a budding world order in which peaceful coexistence and mutual cooperation based on goodwill will be universal norms.
[time=2313] The prophets of that day, the prophets who both of them have brought to us a whole new world, a whole new composition of world thought,
[time=2323] dawned in their administrations.
[time=2325] They were predicting this great day of worldwide peace.
[time=2329] And we do look at the world today.
[time=2332] And we noticed that the concerns for food and fuel and population explosion and the care of the environment and the sustaining of the economy as fragile as it may be are no longer viewed as one nation's problem but as all the nation's problems.
[time=2346] And so we talk about a global economy and a global food supply and a global environmental concern.
[time=2352] And so serious are these concerns and compelling that they are driving the attention of world leaders away from military issues to just hanging on to life itself and cooperating so that the strengths of one can be enjoyed by all and the weaknesses of some can be compensated by the other on a national level.
[time=2376] We are an extensive international interdependence network.
[time=2381] The world has become a very small place.
[time=2383] Robert Mueller with the United Nations for some 33 years and considered their great profit of hope said this, quote, "There will be no third world war between the big powers.
[time=2396] Instead a new age, a new world, a new genesis, a true global God abiding political moral and spiritual renaissance to make this planet at last what it always was meant to be the planet of God." Here you have an unbeliever.
[time=2414] One who would speak like the antichrist, one who would speak like one of the prophets who will be in great number.
[time=2421] They will flourish towards the end of the age and they will sing this song or one like it and they will propagate a time of worldwide peace as the new order and the new day and they will finally have in their grasp utopia.
[time=2436] Now obviously I'm not trying to suggest to you that that these are the days, I don't know the days, I don't know when they come.
[time=2445] I see the decay of our society and I see the absolute shrinking of the world and this may be the day but I'm not here to tell you that these are the beginning false prophets who usher us into that and it will soon be raptured and that then this first seal will be open.
[time=2460] The Lord said in Matthew 24 that no man knows the day or the hour, all I'm trying to describe, these are the kinds of factors, these are the kinds of dynamics that are existing which can lead to our understanding of a worldwide peace, a commitment to a worldwide peace.
[time=2477] And that's how this whole thing begins.
[time=2482] This is the calm before the storm and you'll notice as we study through this fascinating that the world having tasted this world peace just once in this first seal, as brief as it is, having tasted it just once will spend the rest of the seven years believing they can get it back.
[time=2498] Even though the world continues to degenerate they will continue to cry out peace and safety.
[time=2503] They will continue to believe in their heart and their mind that somehow, someway this total decay and destruction of the world as we know it, it really must happen because then we can get on with the old or get away from the old and get on with the new day.
[time=2518] So this really becomes the trap of Satan.
[time=2520] This is the way he lures the world into thinking that man we had that peace for a moment and though everything's falling apart, maybe that's okay.
[time=2527] Maybe that's good, maybe the destruction of the world as we have known it is necessary for us to get to this new day of peace.
[time=2534] And he'll perpetrate that lie because he doesn't want people in the tribulation period coming to Christ.
[time=2540] Now something they can hang on to, they'll take a hold of this first seal, the peace herein, as a reason not to believe that what the Bible says is true, that it is the end and I better come to Christ.
[time=2551] And so this will be the lie that is perpetrated by Satan and his false prophets in the any Christ.
[time=2557] They'll hang on to that brief moment of peace at the beginning of the tribulation.
[time=2561] Doesn't last long because the guy in charge is in heaven,
[time=2568] his name is Jesus, he's the worthy one.
[time=2570] He's the one who is slain yet standing and he holds in his hand the scroll and as easily as he opened the first one, he'll then open the second one.
[time=2576] And look at it with me.
[time=2577] When he broke the second seal in verse three, I heard the second living creature saying, come and another red horse went out and to him who sat on it was granted to take peace from the earth.
[time=2587] That's another reason I believe the beginning of the tribulation starts with the first seal of peace because it is this red horse that takes the peace away.
[time=2595] What the earth had in peace, it is now ripped out of their hands by the red horse and the force that the red horse represents.
[time=2601] That men should slay when another and a great sword was given to him.
[time=2606] A great sword was given to him.
[time=2609] The red horse, obviously a symbol of blood.
[time=2611] The false peace is over and it falls apart.
[time=2614] The world's society begins to degenerate and they are now killing each other.
[time=2618] Look at it in verse four, that men should slay one another.
[time=2621] Ezekiel 38, 21 says, every man's sword will be against his brother speaking of the same era.
[time=2627] So it's not just nation against nation now beginning to fight, it's a war on a community level.
[time=2632] It's a war on a household level.
[time=2634] It's a war where brother takes brother's life.
[time=2637] War is the prevailing reality of the day.
[time=2641] The world is at war.
[time=2642] And the sword there, the Makira.
[time=2649] It's really an assassin's sword.
[time=2651] It's great in its ability to do destruction but it is small in actual physical size.
[time=2657] It is the assassin's dagger, which also strengthens the notion that this killing will not just be national fighting and wars, it will be the individual murder and assassin one of another.
[time=2669] The world will be unleashed with its murderous intent and the anger and the lust and the jealousy of man will run rampant.
[time=2678] Following on its heels is the third seal.
[time=2684] Look at it in verses five and six.
[time=2686] And when he broke the third seal, I heard the living creature saying come and I looked and behold a black horse.
[time=2695] And he who said it, said on it had a pair of scales in his hands.
[time=2700] And I heard as it were a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying a court of wheat for a denarius.
[time=2704] And three courts of barley for a denarius.
[time=2707] And do not harm the oil and the wine.
[time=2709] This is famine.
[time=2711] This is describing the conditions of famine.
[time=2715] And the writer doesn't have a sword.
[time=2719] The writer has instead the scales.
[time=2721] The scales which are measuring out what little you can buy
[time=2728] for your day's wage.
[time=2731] A denarius was typically a day's wage.
[time=2733] And you could only get a court of wheat.
[time=2737] You could only get enough to maybe feed yourself for one day.
[time=2740] You'd work all day to get enough to eat for that day.
[time=2742] That's all you'd have.
[time=2743] These are famine conditions.
[time=2747] Which seems to be the obvious conclusion when war breaks out and everybody's involved in killing everybody and everybody's given themselves to the defense effort as it might be described.
[time=2757] Who works?
[time=2759] Who produces food?
[time=2760] No one and famine strikes and people starve to death.
[time=2765] And then the Lord up in heaven opens the fourth seal.
[time=2771] And that's found in verses seven and eight.
[time=2772] And when he broke the fourth seal I heard the voice to the four living creatures saying come.
[time=2777] And I looked and behold an Ashen horse.
[time=2780] And he who sat on it had the name of death and Hades was following with him.
[time=2784] And authority was given to them.
[time=2785] Over a fourth of the earth to kill was sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.
[time=2793] The Ashen horse that's kind of a yellow, green, sickly color.
[time=2798] It's the horse of sickness.
[time=2800] It's the horse of pestilence.
[time=2804] It's the consequence of war followed by famine followed by death followed by disease.
[time=2810] The world is diseased.
[time=2812] And it's the lives of those who live on the world are being taken by disease.
[time=2816] Maybe a pestilence such as AIDS would be able to account for such a great number of people dying.
[time=2821] Notice in verse eight it's a fourth of the earth that dies.
[time=2825] And they die by the sword, the wars of the second seal.
[time=2828] They die of the famine, the consequence of the third seal.
[time=2831] And they die of the consequence of this, the fourth seal, the pestilence.
[time=2835] It is death.
[time=2837] It is the sickly yellow, greenish look of death.
[time=2842] And notice also they wild beasts get into the act.
[time=2846] The society is so degraded.
[time=2848] The man is so stripped of his society.
[time=2851] And what we know today as your ability to care for yourself that even the wild beasts are having a field day.
[time=2857] And they are destroying and killing.
[time=2858] They are taking part in this great massacre.
[time=2864] And so a quarter of the world's population dies.
[time=2868] Now this basically takes us to the end of the first three
[time=2874] and a half years.
[time=2875] These basically, there is the fifth seal that we'll look at next time, which is the margin of the people who have come to Christ in the tribulation.
[time=2881] But these are descriptive of the turmoil and the crushing reality of the first three and a half years.
[time=2887] And if you would, keep your finger there for a minute and come with me to Matthew 24.
[time=2892] And I want you to see some of the same from the Lord.
[time=2894] Matthew 24, 25 is called the Olivet Discourse
[time=2907] because the Lord gave it while sitting on the Mount of Olives.
[time=2910] Matthew 24 verse 3, he was sitting there on the Mount of Olives and the disciples came to him privately with these questions.
[time=2919] Tell us when will these things be?
[time=2921] And what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?
[time=2925] They want to know, man, how does all this work out?
[time=2927] When does this happen?
[time=2929] And how will we know that it's coming?
[time=2931] What will the signs be?
[time=2933] Well, he answers the first question when over in verse 36.
[time=2936] You might just look at that.
[time=2937] He says very clearly, but of that day and hour, no one knows.
[time=2944] Nobody knows.
[time=2946] Stop asking me when.
[time=2947] I'm not going to tell you because nobody knows.
[time=2948] Not even the angels of heaven, nor the sun.
[time=2951] I don't even know.
[time=2953] In my humanist, I don't even know when the hour is.
[time=2956] Only the Father knows.
[time=2957] So these people who want to run around and set dates, these people who want to predict a particular year, or tell us a particular decade, or tell us that this has got to happen now because this has happened and this has happened and this thing in Europe has gone on.
[time=2972] And while those are interesting and need to be looked at, you always need to stop short of trying to say, oh, this is the day.
[time=2978] See, this is the hour.
[time=2980] The Lord said, don't do that, nobody knows.
[time=2982] And if anybody tells you they know, the obvious implication is they're a liar.
[time=2986] The obvious implication is don't give yourself to try to figure that out.
[time=2989] The only thing he really says to us about that is that the day of the Lord is like a thief who comes in the night, he comes suddenly and unexpectedly.
[time=2997] Nobody's going to know.
[time=2999] Nobody's going to be able to figure out the exact time.
[time=3002] But back in verse 3, tell us when will these things be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?
[time=3010] Now that, he does answer.
[time=3012] He does give some preliminary indicators and they parallel this first four seals of Revelation 6.
[time=3019] Look at verse 4, and Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one misleads you.
[time=3024] For many will come in my name saying, 'I am the Christ and will mislead any, will mislead many.' This is the great deception of the first seal." And we don't have time this morning, but if you looked at the message of the false prophets, you would continually see them saying peace and safety.
[time=3038] You would continually hear them crying out peace and safety.
[time=3042] Their job, the job of these false Christ and these false prophets is to continue to lure the people into a false sense of assurance that what they had experienced in that false peace at the beginning they can retrieve.
[time=3054] And so this great misleading is the first seal.
[time=3059] Then verse 6, and what you, and you will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars.
[time=3065] See that you are not frightened for those things must take place, but that is not yet the end.
[time=3070] In fact, those wars are occurring.
[time=3072] There is war, a worldwide war.
[time=3075] Nation, verse 7, will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom.
[time=3078] And in various places there will be what?
[time=3080] Famine, famine is what followed war in Revelation 6.
[time=3086] It's the third seal.
[time=3088] And earthquakes he adds, but all these things are merely what?
[time=3093] The beginning of birth pains.
[time=3100] This is just the start.
[time=3102] This is just the beginning.
[time=3104] This is the first three and a half years.
[time=3107] Now look at verse 15.
[time=3109] Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place, let the reader understand.
[time=3118] In other words, once that happens, that's the midpoint.
[time=3120] Then comes the great tribulation.
[time=3122] And when that happens, run.
[time=3125] Look at verse 16, then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.
[time=3128] Let him who was on the house top, not go down to get the things out that are in his house.
[time=3133] Don't even pause to get your belongings.
[time=3134] Just get out of there.
[time=3136] Verse 18, and let him who was in the field not turn back to get his cloak.
[time=3139] But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babes in those days.
[time=3143] In other words, they're slowed down in their flight from that place because they're pregnant.
[time=3147] And they gotta feed their newborns.
[time=3149] Verse 20, pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath because winter slows down your flight and so does the Sabbath if you're observing Sabbath law.
[time=3158] Then verse 21, "For then there will be a great tribulation
[time=3164] such as has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall.
[time=3169] And unless those days have been cut short, no life would have been saved for the sake of the elect those days shall be cut short." That is the basic division.
[time=3182] Now back to Revelation chapter 6.
[time=3186] What we find in Revelation chapter 6 is this deceptive misleading ministry of the false prophets and the false Christ and the antichrist.
[time=3198] They promise peace and they somehow make it happen.
[time=3202] The global concerns may draw people to a place of datant and they proclaim themselves the ones who have finally given the world what it deserves, a new age, the utopia.
[time=3212] But they are not in control.
[time=3215] And Christ opens his second seal, which is vast war that breaks out all over the world, all over the world in all the households, which is followed by this great famine, which is followed by great pestilence and a quarter of the world is dead.
[time=3233] There are some four billion plus people on the planet.
[time=3237] You know what it would be like?
[time=3240] Over a short period of time, three and a half years, to see a quarter, a billion, a billion people die.
[time=3247] There haven't been a hundred million people die in all the wars of the ages, phenomenal, phenomenal death.
[time=3255] And that's just the beginning.
[time=3260] That's just the warm up.
[time=3262] That's just the preliminary birth pains of labor.
[time=3266] We haven't even started the big stuff, the hard stuff, the supernatural stuff.
[time=3271] You say, is there any hope for the world?
[time=3276] No.
[time=3279] There's absolutely no hope for the world.
[time=3281] Where is the world headed?
[time=3283] Destruction.
[time=3284] Will the vice president and those who are conscience of the environment be able to save the world?
[time=3290] No.
[time=3293] God made this world a disposable world.
[time=3296] God made this world a consumable world, and He will dispose of it, and He will consume it.
[time=3303] And when He is done, He will make a new one.
[time=3305] You say, is there any hope for the world?
[time=3311] No.
[time=3312] Is there any hope for me?
[time=3316] Yes.
[time=3317] Listen to the words of the writer of Hebrews chapter two.
[time=3320] "How shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?" If you come to Christ, if you know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, if you have confessed your sin, if you have said, I have violated the glory of God, I have fallen short, I am worthy of death, I cannot earn salvation, I cannot do enough good works to benefit heaven, and instead say, so give me the Savior, give me the Christ, give me the one who died in my stead, and take Him unto yourself, then there is wonderful hope, and you will not only not see the great tribulation, or the birth pains, you'll be raptured before all of that with the rest of us who know Christ, you'll be in heaven watching all of this, praising God as it all occurs.
[time=3364] You'll miss the terrible trouble that the earth will have,
[time=3370] and then you would also miss hell.
[time=3373] The eternal damnation which awaits all who have not accepted Christ.
[time=3377] And so this morning, a little bit like Paul Revere, on his famous midnight ride, when he cried out the British are coming, the British are coming, I would say to you, the wrath of God is coming, the wrath of God is coming.
[time=3396] I don't know when, it may be in our lifetime, it may not be for another 2,000 years, but the sure message of the Word of God is if you're alive today, and you've heard the gospel, and you know that wrath is coming.
[time=3410] Today, repent, today, humble yourself,
[time=3416] today come to Christ.
[time=3418] Let's pray together.
[time=3422] (gentle music) - Music plays a very important part in the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=3431] I hope you enjoyed the sanctuary choir and the ministry of reflection.
[time=3435] The message today was from our pastor, Teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3438] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3446] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that you sent your son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3454] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3457] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3462] In Jesus name I pray, amen.
[time=3465] If you prayed that prayer today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3470] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, Lessons on Assurance, to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
