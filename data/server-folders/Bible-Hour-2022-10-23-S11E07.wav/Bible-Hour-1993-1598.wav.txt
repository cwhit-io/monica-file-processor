[time=36] >> Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible Study Music and Fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be in encouragement.
[time=42] Thank you for joining us.
[time=43] Jesus Christ enters Jerusalem to the friendly cries of several hundred thousand voices.
[time=49] It's their best effort at declaring Him King of Israel.
[time=53] But within a few short days, those same voices are now crying for His crucifixion.
[time=57] What went wrong?
[time=58] Stay with us this morning for an exciting look at the triumphal entry of Christ.
[time=62] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Matthew chapter 21.
[time=67] We'll be looking at verses 9 through 11.
[time=70] Our special music today will be provided by the Handbale Choir and Michelle Smecken's.
[time=82] Let's now join our Sanctuary Choir as they sing God's Almighty Son.

[time=823] Amen. Thank you, Michelle. Well done. What is it in the heart of a believer that just wants to have that song? Just that way. Beautiful job.
[time=833] Well, if you have your Bibles this morning, I want to invite you to come with me to Matthew chapter 21 and we'll depart from our study in the book of Revelation and look at the triumphant entry.
[time=846] The last entering of Christ into the city of Jerusalem. And maybe to set our thinking for that, let me ask you to think first a little bit about the importance of credentials.
[time=860] And I know that as a young boy of about 16 years of age, I had to have operations on both of my feet. They were slightly deformed. They had to be corrected.
[time=870] And my dad was very, very careful in the selecting of the orthopedic surgeon to do that. And he not only looked to ensure obviously that he was state or board qualified, that he had the right documents hanging on the wall, but that he had quite a reputation as being able to perform in accordance with those printed credentials.
[time=891] I remember visiting over five or six different orthopedic surgeons, each one offering his recommended procedure to fix my feet until finally my dad with the counsel of some of his other physician friends landed on a particular doctor and we went with his procedure.
[time=908] And whether it be a physician or whether it be someone who prepares your taxes and you have much at stake there, misrepresenting yourself before the federal government and possibly have not properly done losing money or whether it be someone who help you with your investing program, there are obviously tests and credentials that those individuals must have and perform to.
[time=929] We are accustomed to the notion of credentials, both the printed document which says this person has been tested and is approved and then their reputation shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are capable that they are credentialed for their job.
[time=945] With that in mind, look for a moment at verses eight and following the triumphal entry.
[time=953] Chapter 21 and most of the multitude spread their garments in the road and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road and the multitude going before him and those who followed after him were crying out, saying, "Hosanna to the son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord."
[time=971] "Hosanna in the highest." And when he entered Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, "Who is this?"
[time=981] Then the multitude were saying, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee."
[time=988] You see, this was some awesome display and though it may not immediately present itself to you a closer examination of this text will tell you they were trying to make him king.
[time=998] This was their attempt at a coronation service. They were trying to inaugurate Jesus of Nazareth as the king of Israel.
[time=1006] You see, what do you say that? Well, in verse nine, this word or a little phrase, "The son of David."
[time=1013] This is the messianic title of the Old Testament. This is the one who would be the Messiah, the great one who would deliver his people and establish the kingdom, the eternal kingdom.
[time=1025] And so by calling him son of David, they knew that wasn't his name. They knew his name was Jesus.
[time=1031] But what they are saying is, "You are indeed the Messiah. You are the promised one of the Old Testament."
[time=1039] Also, they are shouting the name or really the word "Hosanna," which is an Old Testament phrase, "Yasha in the Hebrew."
[time=1046] And it means to make a broad place, to make it wider, to make it longer, to make it deeper, to make a confined space very broad to give it breadth and depth.
[time=1058] The Hosanna experience of the Old Testament was in the Exodus when the people of God were encamped there on the red sea and they were being pressed in upon by Pharaoh's army.
[time=1069] They were in a confined place, they were constrained, and they were crying out for a broad place to be delivered from this constraining between the red sea and the army of Pharaoh.
[time=1082] The whole experience of the Exodus is remembered by the law of God and the Jewish nation through this thing we call the Passover.
[time=1092] The Passover is the remembrance of the great deliverance of the people of Israel, not just from the red sea and Pharaoh's army, but from the whole Egyptian experience.
[time=1100] And God never wanted to have them forget his delivering power, and so every year they would remember the Passover.
[time=1107] When they were done with the Passover as a part of the concluding exercises, they would sing Psalm 118.
[time=1115] You don't need to turn there, let me read two verses from it. They sang after the Passover from my distress, "The Lord answered me and set me in a large place."
[time=1127] This is the Hosanna thought. You have expanded us, you have set us into a large place.
[time=1133] Verse 29, they sing, "Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord." Look again at verse 9, "Hosanna to the Son of David.
[time=1143] Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest." Make no mistake about it.
[time=1153] They viewed Jesus Christ to be the Old Testament Messiah who would deliver them.
[time=1158] They viewed Him as the Hosanna, one, the great one who would make their space enlarged and give them room to breathe under the oppressive Roman government who had taken charge of their land.
[time=1170] Verse 8, "Please notice, and most of the multitudes spread their garments in the road and others were cutting branches." We know from one of the synoptics that it was a series of palm branches. What are they doing there?
[time=1182] Well, in ancient times, in this particular time of world history, when they would inaugurate a king, when a king would enter, they would take off their garment and throw it at his feet.
[time=1191] As if to say, "We are your people. We are your subjects. We are available to do your bidding call, in fact, walk over us if need be."
[time=1200] So they were saying, "You are the Messiah. You are the one who will deliver us." Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We throw our garments down in front of you, and the palm branches indicating the great victory and celebration of the deliverance of the people from their bondage in Egypt.
[time=1219] What they are saying is, "You are the Hosena man." And this is the Hosena time. In other words, they had come to Jerusalem. The city had swollen to an unusual population of some two million people because they had all gathered there to remember the Passover.
[time=1236] And so in their mind, this is it. This is the great moment they've been waiting for. The Hosena man is coming at the Hosena time, the great Passover itself.
[time=1245] And they're envisioning, "This is the way that God is going to unfold for us, deliverance from Rome. There couldn't be a better time. He's the one. This is the day, and we are the people."
[time=1256] And we're going to get to experience this great and awesome deliverance from our Roman oppression.
[time=1265] What brought them to this conclusion? What brought this multitude? Several hundred thousand who had come with Him from His previous ministry of raising Lazarus from the dead, and then He moved on through the countryside and came to the outskirts of Jerusalem.
[time=1278] And He was surrounded by a multitude, the text says. And here another multitude rushes out from the city. There are probably several hundred thousand people in this one great throng, crying out Hosena to the Son of David.
[time=1290] What brought this on? What are His credentials? What are Christ's credentials? What is it that makes this humble little son of a carpenter receive this kind of accolade, this kind of parade, this retenu of rejoicing and celebration and this attempted coronation of a king?
[time=1314] Well, it's hinted at in verse 10. They entered Jerusalem and all the city was stirred. Everybody was asking that question. Who hadn't known? Who is this? What are His credentials?
[time=1324] This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth and Galilee. This morning I want to spend some time examining the credentials of the king.
[time=1335] That's what the book of Matthew is all about, especially the first nine chapters. And so if you will, come back with me to chapter 1.
[time=1342] Matthew chapter 1, let's look at five credentials of the king. There are many in this book. There are many elsewhere in the synoptic gospels.
[time=1352] But we will look at five this morning that are kind of laid out in order by Matthew who wrote this book to present Christ as king.
[time=1360] Now again Matthew writes after the fact, and in this throng that is screaming Hosanna to the son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, I don't think they would have laid it out in this very proper sequential order.
[time=1375] But certainly they had were students of the Old Testament and certainly they had heard things about Christ. And these are the kinds of things that the people in the nation of Israel would have been talking over their cup of coffee or whatever they were drinking as they were eating.
[time=1388] And as they were traveling to Jerusalem and the ongoing of their life for the last three and a half years they've been hearing about this guy named Jesus.
[time=1395] And there's been all kinds of discussion as to whether or not he's the Messiah. And their discussions would have no doubt touched on these high points.
[time=1403] And Matthew chronicles them for us and puts them in order. The first one. The first credential of the king. Look at chapter 1 verse 1.
[time=1411] The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. To make Christ the son of Abraham, you remember Genesis chapter 12, Abraham was the founder of the nation of Israel. He was the beginning of the nation of Israel.
[time=1427] It was with Abraham that God made a covenant to make this great nation, the nation of Israel.
[time=1432] So first of all we note that Christ is from the line of Abraham, but that's nothing too unique. I mean everybody who is a Jew is from Abraham. He began it.
[time=1441] So next in verse 1 he says the son of David. He has the genealogy of the son of David.
[time=1449] The Old Testament Jew knew that it was 2 Samuel chapter 7 verses 12 and 16 that God promised and made a covenant, the David covenant with King David, that it would be through David's line that the Messiah would come.
[time=1463] It would be through David that this one would come to establish the eternal kingdom.
[time=1469] So credential number 1. Credential number 1 is that Christ comes from the royal line and we won't go through verses 2 and following but you can see a whole bunch of names there.
[time=1480] And what that is is that's that's Matthew giving the lineage of Christ all the way from Abraham down through David until finally in verse 16 it says into Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary by whom Jesus was born.
[time=1496] Who is called Christ? Look at that in verse 16 it's interesting. Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary and then this phrase by whom was born Jesus, the word by whom in the Greek is a feminine singular.
[time=1511] And if you knew Greek and you were reading this in the original language it would just jump out at you like a neon sign and it says this, Christ came through Mary not Joseph.
[time=1522] It's already hinting at the virgin birth. So credential number 1 is that Christ is worthy to be king. Christ is worthy of this great accolade, Hosanna to the Son of David because he came from the right family tree.
[time=1540] Credential number 2. Look over with me at verse 22. Credential number 2, verse 22 and 23.
[time=1549] Now all this took place that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet. Be fulfilled saying this verse 23, "Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a son and they shall call his name immanuel," which translated means God with us.
[time=1568] He's quoting Isaiah 7. There was an Old Testament prophecy which meant or which declared that the Messiah had to be born of a virgin in fulfilling that Old Testament prophecy.
[time=1583] Look at verse 5 of chapter 2. And when they said to him in Bethlehem of Judea, "For so it has been written by the prophet," speaking of Micah chapter 5 verse 2, "and you Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you shall come forth a ruler who will shepherd the people of Israel."
[time=1607] There was another Old Testament prophecy that the Messiah had to fulfill, and it is that he had to come out of Bethlehem.
[time=1614] Look at chapter 2, verse 15. We could begin in verse 14. "And he arose and took the child and his mother by night and departed for Egypt."
[time=1625] And I remember why Pharaoh, or rather Herod the king, was looking to destroy him. Verse 15, "And was there until the death of Herod that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophets might be fulfilled saying," and now he quotes Hosea 111, "Out of Egypt did I call my son."
[time=1646] So yet another Old Testament prophet, which says, "The Messiah must come from Egypt." And then one other Old Testament prophecy, verses 22 and 23, "But when he heard that Archelleus was raining over Judea in place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there and being warned by God in a dream he departed for the regions of Galilee."
[time=1670] And came and resided in a city called Nazareth that what was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled. He shall be called in Nazarene.
[time=1680] What's Matthew telling us? Matthew is telling us that the second credential to be the king, the Messiah of Israel, is that you have to fulfill specific Old Testament prophecies.
[time=1692] Number one, you've got to be born of a virgin, Isaiah 7. Number two, you've got to come out of Bethlehem. Number three, you've got to come out of Egypt.
[time=1704] And number four, you've got to be in Nazarene. And God sovereignly orchestrating the circumstances of Herod and speaking to Joseph and leading this whole thing, conceiving Mary through the Holy Spirit.
[time=1718] Here Jesus fulfills completely the Old Testament prophecies required of Him to be credentialed as the king.
[time=1726] Credential number three, come to Matthew chapter three. This is a fascinating credential. This is without question the most important if you can rank them.
[time=1737] You remember John the Baptist was prophesied by Isaiah that he would be the voice crying in the wilderness, making ready the way for the Messiah.
[time=1744] And of course John the Baptist did that. He had his message loud, long and clear, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand in verse two.
[time=1753] And finally in their lives, John the Baptist and Jesus met up at the river Jordan. Verse 13, then Jesus arrived from Galilee at Jordan coming to John to be baptized.
[time=1765] That's an interesting thought. Christ being baptized. And that was done according to the Lord's desire. But after the baptism, look at verses 16 and 17.
[time=1775] And after being baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water and behold the heavens were open and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him in in verse 17.
[time=1785] And behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, quote, this is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased.
[time=1794] My beloved son, the term beloved speaks of the deep, rich, intimate relationship of God the Father and God the Son.
[time=1802] He says, my beloved son in whom I am well pleased and this little word in the Greek well pleased is used only after careful scrutiny and examination.
[time=1812] God is saying, this is the one that I love. I have examined him thoroughly and completely and after that examination, I'm well pleased.
[time=1822] This is my boy. This is my, this is my son. This is God in the form of human flesh.
[time=1830] And so this third qualification is none other than God himself speaking from heaven in an audible voice to all who would hear this one has divine approval from heaven.
[time=1844] This is the Messiah. Divine approval from heaven. Qualification number three. Divine approval from heaven.
[time=1854] He says, I have looked him over. I have scrutinized him. There is no defect. There is no imperfection.
[time=1864] Now look at chapter four. And listen or see with me. Qualification number four.
[time=1875] And this is, this is an intense moment in biblical history. Chapter four verse one, then Jesus was led up by the spirit into the wilderness, the wilderness of Judea, a barren and lonely place.
[time=1887] Desolate to be tempted by the devil. To be tempted by the devil.
[time=1894] And that is to be tested. Christ is now going to be put to test in the greatest spiritual confrontation that has ever occurred.
[time=1904] The living God and human flesh is going to face the devil and the devil is going to try to entice him in his flesh, in his humaneness, and draw him into pride and autonomy and independence to step away from complete and total obedience from God, his father.
[time=1920] Verse two, as if to stack the deck and after he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights, he then became hungry. That may be the greatest understatement in all the word of God.
[time=1930] Try famished. Try emotionally weak, spiritually weak, mentally weak. The man has not eaten for 40 days and 40 nights. He is in the perfect place to do what he saw did and sell his entire birthright.
[time=1948] To be consumed and under the control of his appetites, he is at a weakened state and then the tempter came, verse three.
[time=1957] And three times the tempter temps, if you are the son of God, command that these stones become bread.
[time=1963] In the midst of your starvation and the midst of your hunger, let me appeal to the lust of the flesh.
[time=1968] In verse six, he comes, "If you are the son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written he will give his angels charge concerning you."
[time=1977] And on their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against the stone now, Satan, even Marshall's scripture itself reveals a very good understanding of the Old Testament and quotes Saul 91 in the face of Christ.
[time=1991] Appeals to the pride of life. Then he temps him again in verse nine, "All these things I will give you."
[time=1999] One of these things, verse eight, took him to a very high mountain, showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
[time=2004] I don't know how Satan did that, but they were certainly his to give. Satan is the monarch of this age.
[time=2009] He took Christ to a mountain and the top of the mountain, the pinnacle. And somehow, I don't understand it, but somehow he seems to have revealed the kingdoms of the world.
[time=2017] Maybe all the centuries of time were spun in front of the face of Christ. And Satan is saying, "These are mine."
[time=2023] They have been given to me by God, and the monarch of this age, and the prince of the power of the earth, Ephesians six, I'll give them to you.
[time=2031] You don't have to suffer on the cross. You don't have to walk down to the place of Galgotha.
[time=2036] You don't have to die. I'll give all of this to you, their mine. All you've got to do is fall down and worship me, verse nine.
[time=2046] Verse 10, "Here comes the king." Then Jesus said to him, "Be gone, Satan. For it is written, you shall worship the Lord your God and serve him only."
[time=2060] What kind of a qualification is this? This shows Christ to have an impeccable character. What impeccable means without sin?
[time=2070] Credential. Number four is that Christ has a godly, sinless character, and he can go face to face all alone in the wilderness with Satan one-on-one after fasting forty days, and forty nights, and be offered everything that Satan has to give him, and his character is so strong, and so pure, and so right, and so just, he just says, "Be gone."
[time=2094] I'm not interested. And so what the god had spoken from heaven in verse 17 of the previous chapter, "This is my beloved son and whom I am well pleased. I have examined him. I have looked him over. He is without flaw. He is without any inherent intrinsic movement towards sin is then proved and declared beyond any shadow of doubt as he faces Satan."
[time=2118] So it's an amazing testimony to the credentials of Christ. Christ came from the royal line. Christ fulfilled four different old Testament prophecies, at least the four cited by Matthew in chapter two.
[time=2135] Christ had audibly the divine approval of God speaking from heaven, and Christ had an impeccable character. He could face Satan himself and not sin.
[time=2147] But the question comes, "What can he do? What can he do?" Okay, he was born in the right family. Okay, he was hustled around the Middle East by his parents and got to all the right places. Okay, some voice spoke about him from heaven.
[time=2164] Okay, he went all by himself into the wilderness and were told he didn't sin.
[time=2170] If those are the documents on the wall, maybe those could be viewed as the paper that hangs on the wall in the frame that says, "Bored approved." What can he do?
[time=2179] I want to see one of his patients. I want to see the product of his labor. Can he actually perform as he is credentialed to perform?
[time=2189] Well, the answer is unequivocally yes, and that answer is given repeatedly in chapters eight and nine of Matthew. Let's look at it for just a minute.
[time=2198] You tell me if this guy's got power. You tell me if this guy has the power to perform as a king ought to perform.
[time=2209] Chapter eight, verse two, "Behold a leper came, bowed down to him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."
[time=2216] He stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing, be cleansed." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
[time=2224] Verse five, "When he had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him and treated him and saying, 'Lord, my servant is lying, paralyzed at home, suffering great pain.'"
[time=2235] Now, when Jesus heard this in verse 10, he marveled and said, "To those who were following truly, truly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel, and I say to you that many shall come."
[time=2244] From East and West and reclined at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, then verse 13, "Go your way, let it be done to you as you have believed."
[time=2253] And the servant was healed that very hour.
[time=2257] Verse 14, "Jesus had come to Peter's home. He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever. He touched her hand and the fever left her, so complete was her healing. She immediately arose and awaited on him."
[time=2272] Does he have any power? He's got power in those three cases over sickness.
[time=2280] Well, what other kind of power does he have? Look at verses 23 and following.
[time=2284] And when he got into a boat on the sea of Galilee, his disciples followed him.
[time=2289] Remember now, many of these disciples had made their living fishing. They were acquainted with the sea of Galilee.
[time=2296] Behold, there arose a great storm in the sea so that the boat was covered with the waves, but he himself was asleep.
[time=2304] And they came to him and awoke him, saying, "As if in panic, save us! We're perishing! Grown men, fishermen!"
[time=2314] And he said to them, "Why are you timid young men of little faith?" Then he arose and rebuked the winds in the sea, and it became perfectly calm.
[time=2322] You read one of the synoptics on this, it says that Jesus stood up and said, "Hush!"
[time=2328] He literally just hushed the wind and the sea. And notice it says it became perfectly calm.
[time=2333] Typically when a storm is raging and the waves are crashing over the aside of the boat, that storm will eventually reside at a very slow pace.
[time=2342] It will back off gradually and finally it will be calm, and there will be the calm after a storm.
[time=2348] Jesus stood up, said, "Be quiet to the storm, and instantly the wind stopped, and instantly the sea of Galilee became smooth as glass."
[time=2360] Then in verse 28, "Come to the other side, got out of the boat." He was there with the getterines.
[time=2366] Two men were demon-possessed, met him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so exceedingly violent that nobody could pass by the road.
[time=2373] They cried out, saying, "What we have to do with you, son of God, you see these demons, they know who Christ was."
[time=2379] Have you come here to torment us before the time? Apparently these demons have a pretty clear view of eschatology. They've read the book of Revelation.
[time=2387] Now there was a distance from them, a herd of many swine feeding, and the demons began to entreat him, saying, "If you are going to cast us out, send us into the herd of swine."
[time=2396] Then he said to them, "Be gone, and they came out and went into the swine and behold the whole herd rushed down the steep bank and into the sea and perished in the water."
[time=2406] He freed these demon-possessed men of their demons.
[time=2413] And of course, then the whole city came out in verse 34 and asked Jesus to leave.
[time=2419] "Don't be doing that to our swine anymore. Please get out of here."
[time=2425] Chapter 9 verse 2, "Behold, there was bringing to him a paralytic lying on a bed. Jesus seeing their face said to the paralytic, "Take courage, my son, your sins are forgiven."
[time=2434] Oh, your sins are forgiven. Now we're really talking about big power, not just power over sickness, not just power over storm in the sea, not just power over the demonic world.
[time=2444] Now we're talking about the power to forgive sin.
[time=2448] And it aggravated the scribes and the Pharisees in verse 3 behold some of the scribes said to themselves, "This fellow blasphemes."
[time=2455] In other words, only God can say, "Your sins are forgiven." And Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why are you thinking evil in your hearts?" Which is easier to say, "Your sins are forgiven or rise and walk." They're both miraculous. No mere mortal can do either.
[time=2470] And if you can do one, you can do the other because the one proves your God.
[time=2473] To be able to say, "Rise and walk to a paralytic is to say I am God. I free you from that persecution or that being constrained and of that physical disease."
[time=2482] And I also have the power to free you from the disease of sin.
[time=2487] Verse 6, "But in order that you may know that the Son of Man is authority on earth to forgive sins, then he said to the paralytic rise, "Take up your bed and go home."
[time=2495] And he rose and went home.
[time=2500] Look at verse 18. There's another whole category of power that Christ reveals while he was saying these things to them behold there came a synagogue official.
[time=2511] He bowed down before him saying, "My daughter has just died. Come and lay your hand on her and she will live."
[time=2519] Verse 23, "And when Jesus came into the official's house, apparently it took some time to get there and saw the flute players and the crowd and noisy disorder."
[time=2528] This is the picture of mayhem. This is the mourners in mayhem and these flute players were customarily hired by the people of Israel to come and give solace to the mourners.
[time=2538] And so they've been hired and they're performing their duty and the crowd is gathering and they can't believe that the daughter of this official has died.
[time=2547] Verse 24, "He began to say depart for the girl has not died, but is asleep."
[time=2554] And they began laughing at him as if to say, "You fool! She's dead in a doornail. Leave her alone."
[time=2563] Verse 25, "But when the crowd had been put out, he entered and took her by the hand and the girl arose."
[time=2571] And this news went out into all the land.
[time=2575] Verse 27, "Jesus passed on from there to blind men, followed him, crying out saying, "Have mercy on us, son of David."
[time=2582] And after he had come into the house to blind men, came up to him and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" And they said to him, "Yes, Lord." And he touched their eyes, saying, "Be it done to you according to your faith and their eyes were opened."
[time=2595] He's got power over blindness. And one last thing here in verse 32, there was a dumb man.
[time=2604] He was dumb because he was demon possessed, couldn't speak.
[time=2608] And after the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke and the multitude's marveled, saying, "Nothing like this was ever seen in Israel."
[time=2618] Overwhelming display of the authority of the King. He could cleanse a leper by stretching out his hand. He could heal the paralytics.
[time=2626] He could cool the fever of Peter's mother-in-law by the touch of his hand.
[time=2630] He could stop the raging storm on the sea of Galilee with the mere mention of his word and it went from a raging storm to being calm like glass in a matter of seconds.
[time=2640] He could cast out the demons of the two violent men. He raised a girl from the dead.
[time=2647] He did it all. He gave sight to the blind, restored the speech to a demon possessed man, but now look at verse 35. This sums it up.
[time=2658] Jesus was going about all the cities of the villages teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom.
[time=2664] And here it is, healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
[time=2669] What you see here in these nine or ten miracles is just a mere sampling of the power of Christ to heal.
[time=2676] He moved in and around the promised land and wherever he went, he brought complete and total healing to the people.
[time=2683] And they flocked after him. He was not like the healers of our day who have very specific conditions under which they will heal.
[time=2692] You don't very often see the contemporary healers of our day walk into Parkview Hospital and say, "Okay, everybody's healed."
[time=2699] Clear the deck. Christ could have done that. Christ did that.
[time=2704] They didn't have Parkview Hospital. Everybody just laid around in their homes and he just walked around and he healed, and he healed, and he healed, and he healed, and he healed.
[time=2711] I believe that by the time he was done with his three and a half year ministry, he had basically healed all the disease in Palestine.
[time=2718] Everywhere he went, evidenceing that he was indeed the son of David, that he was indeed the great deliverer.
[time=2729] And he said, "Oh, okay, now I understand why hundreds of thousands of people upon his coming to the city of Jerusalem would come out to him and cry out, "Hosanna, put us in a large place, push away the constraints."
[time=2745] And what they really were hoping for was the constraints of the Roman government, get them out of our land, were sick of the tax collectors,
[time=2753] were sick of these guys coming around and robbing and stealing from us and putting the heavy burden on us, were sick of these Roman governors like Pilate and the others who would sit in oppressive domination, they were wicked men, get them out of our land,
[time=2769] allow us to return to the laws of the Old Testament and govern us, grant us the same glorious deliverance from Rome that you granted to the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.
[time=2780] And do it right now at the Passover, right when we're all gathered here in the city.
[time=2786] Hosanna, there was a sense of expectation that was bubbling over in their hearts, blessed is he who comes, but it raises another question.
[time=2802] How is it that with all those credentials within just a few days that same crowd was crying out for his death?
[time=2814] How is it that same crowd was crying with that same energy and that same passionately this time not to make him king but to kill him and crucify him?
[time=2823] You say, well, had they found him out to be an imposter? Had somebody looked into the genealogies of the nation of Israel and found out that Christ really didn't come from the tribe of David?
[time=2836] From the house of David? Had they found out that somehow that voice which was speaking from heaven was really some type of a ventriloquist trick and it was echoing off a mountain and it just sounded, it just appeared like it was from heaven?
[time=2849] Was that one of his buddies kind of echoing the whole of my son and whom I am well pleased?
[time=2856] Had they discovered that he had actually failed and sinned and compromised with Satan up there and the wilderness of Judea?
[time=2863] Had somebody seen it? Had somebody learned? Had there been some admission of sin and guilt in the life of Christ?
[time=2870] Had they re-examined the thousands of miracles that he performed and discovered that all of them were phony, all of them were fake, that none of it had really happened after all?
[time=2880] He was just one big huge imposter and so in righteous indignation against one who would presume to be the Messiah, they cry out kill him.
[time=2889] Is that what happened? No. No, that's not what happened. You know what happened?
[time=2898] They found out he wasn't going to do what they wanted him to.
[time=2903] They found out he hadn't come to give them Hosanna from the Roman government. He'd come to give them Hosanna from sin.
[time=2911] They found out that Christ had come to give them deliverance from their own sin, their own lust, their own anger, their own hatred, their own murderous behavior and they didn't want it.
[time=2924] They loved their sin. They reveled in their sin.
[time=2931] All they wanted was a Christ who could come and give them deliverance in a political, economic, social form.
[time=2939] And as soon as it finally dawned on them that he wasn't going to deliver them from the nation of Rome, that great exuberant joy, that intense joy turned to an equally intense anger and they were as fickle as they could be.
[time=2959] And they cried out, we don't want Christ, we want Barabbas. Give us a convicted killer, a convicted criminal rather instead of the Christ.
[time=2973] Let me show you this, Matthew chapter 4, verse 17.
[time=2984] By this point, as you remember in Matthew's gospel, Christ is confirmed as having come from the genealogy of David.
[time=2992] Christ is confirmed in chapter 2 as having fulfilled Old Testament prophecy. Christ is confirmed by divine approval for the audible voice of the living God that says, "This is my beloved son."
[time=3003] And Christ has already fought his way through the temptation of Satan.
[time=3008] Now, verse 17, from this time Jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[time=3020] Lest you think he had misled them. Lest you think he had come into the nation of Israel and misled them as to his agenda.
[time=3029] As if he had indicated I'm really here to relieve you from Rome, and at the last minute I'll change my mind. No, from the very beginning, even from the one who heralded his coming, John the Baptist said, "Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."
[time=3042] From the beginning, the deliverance described was one from sin, and he preached that message all the way through his earthly ministry.
[time=3053] He said, "I will deliver you from sin, not from Rome, render under Caesar, remember the things which are Caesars and under God, the things which are God."
[time=3064] I will put you in a large place, not a large place of political freedom, but the large place of the realm of righteousness.
[time=3071] I will transfer you from the kingdom of darkness or the kingdom of his beloved son. I will put you in the broad place of truth and righteousness and godliness, where there are no boundaries, where you're free.
[time=3082] I shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.
[time=3088] I will remove the oppressive constraints, not of Rome, but of your own sinful nature, of your own flesh.
[time=3098] He was talking about a radical transformation. Remember the conversation with Nicodemus?
[time=3103] I will allow you to be born again. There is a new you that can be born, that will give true and total freedom from your tyranny, under sin.
[time=3113] An interchange, a genuine freedom of heart and soul and mind. I can release you. We can drop the fetters of sin from your life and you're free to run into the pursuit of God.
[time=3127] That was his message from the beginning. Look at it in chapter 6. Matthew chapter 6 verses 5, 6, and 7, of course are the Sermon on the Mount. This is the preaching of the king. This is the dogma of the king.
[time=3141] This is the program of the king, and just the central thought of it right there in verse 33, "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you."
[time=3154] Christ is saying, "I will give you a freedom that will supersede and transcend the common realities of life, and whether you're under Rome or some other oppressive government be seeking my kingdom, become a citizen of the kingdom of heaven, and seek that first, seek that as your priority in life."
[time=3172] And as you remember previously in the Sermon on the Mount in chapters 5 and 6, he says, "I'll free you from your anger." You say, "Raka in your heart, I'll free you from that."
[time=3181] "I'll free you from your lust to look on a woman and to lust for her. You've committed adultery. Whether already in your heart, I'll free you from that compulsive desire to lust after women."
[time=3192] "I'll free you from divorce." Matthew 5, he talks there about being unbiblically divorced, and he says, "I'll free you from that thing within you which demands that if this person becomes unacceptable to you, even though you don't have biblical grounds, I'll free you from the compulsion to divorce that person."
[time=3208] "I'll give you the strength to love them unconditionally for all your life. I'll give you real freedom."
[time=3215] "I'll give you freedom from your lying tongue." In Matthew 5, he talks about their oaths, and how they'd make an oath by this, and then they'd break it by a higher oath, and they'd break that by a higher oath, and they knew before they began, they were going to break all those promises. They were liars because they had a liar's heart.
[time=3231] "I'll free you from your lying. I'll give you a new heart, a heart of flesh instead of a heart of stone."
[time=3238] They were given as a people to vengeance, and they believed that you could love your neighbor and hate your enemy, and Christ said, "No, no, no, love your neighbor and love your enemy."
[time=3250] "I'll free you even to the point that you can love the people that hate you. I'll free you to the point that you can be nice and gracious and considerate and compassionate for the cause of Christ in the life of those who would take your possessions and take your life."
[time=3264] "I'll give you a freedom that this world would never know." He said, "I'd give you a freedom to love people."
[time=3273] But they didn't want it. They only wanted him to make their physical, material, natural, external, circumstantial world more enjoyable.
[time=3283] That's all they wanted from him. Make my life happier. Make my life better. Make me richer. Make my circumstances more convenient.
[time=3295] Satisfied the demand in my heart to have life the way I wanted. And when it dawned on him that he was making no such offer, but instead that they should fall and beat on their breasts as a beggar does in the marketplace, crying out, "Have mercy on me. I'm a sinner."
[time=3312] Such that the longing of their heart would be freed from sin. When they figured out that that was his message, when it finally dawned on him, they stood outside the court of pilot and screamed for his crucifixion.
[time=3326] Scream for him. Kill him. With one accord, they lifted fists in the air and cried out, "Kill him."
[time=3336] One more scripture out of Matthew, this morning, Matthew, chapter 11. Look at verses 28, 29, and 30.
[time=3347] He wanted to be their Hosanna. He wanted to free them from the constraints and the burdens of life.
[time=3353] "Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you shall find rest for your souls."
[time=3365] "For my yoke is easy, and my load is light." They missed it. They completely missed it.
[time=3395] We're so glad you tuned in for the Bible hour today. I hope you enjoyed the music from our sanctuary choir, the handbells, and so on.
[time=3424] The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3431] Just before we close this service, I'd like to invite you to pray this prayer with me if you've never accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3438] When this be a great time of the year to just acknowledge that you need Christ as your Savior, let's bow and pray together.
[time=3444] Dear Heavenly Father, how I thank you for sending your Son to die on the cross for my sins, and today I set the need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3453] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed, and be my Savior today. In Jesus name I pray, amen.
