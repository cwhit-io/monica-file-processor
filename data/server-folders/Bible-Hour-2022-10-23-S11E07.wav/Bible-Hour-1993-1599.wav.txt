[time=0] So now I believe with all my heart that America needs to get past the superficial embracing
[time=16] of Easter as a time to take your child to the mall, have them sit on the lap of a bunny
[time=22] and get their picture taken as you hand them another chocolate Easter egg.
[time=27] Nothing wrong with that but there certainly needs to be more to Easter than that.
[time=45] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=51] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] For nearly two thousand years now we have been celebrating Easter.
[time=57] Christ is alive and risen from the dead.
[time=60] But do we celebrate it out of mere tradition?
[time=63] Is it now nothing more than just a routine, a new dress, a tending church, going out to
[time=69] lunch?
[time=70] Or is there in the resurrection of Christ something relevant and vital to our lives in the 90s?
[time=76] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of John chapter 14.
[time=81] We will be looking at verse 6.
[time=85] Our special music today will be provided by the sanctuary choir with Kevin Rowe and Michelle Smekens and a solo from Denise Mitchell.
[time=113] We will be looking at the church and have them open to the book of John chapter 14.
[time=143] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of John chapter 14.
[time=320] [MUSIC - 404 seconds]
[time=754] [APPLAUSE]
[time=760] Well, what a privilege it is today to serve the risen Savior. I'm so thankful that we have this opportunity to go into your homes or wherever you might be today to minister to you on this resurrection Sunday.
[time=772] Russell, we've been anticipating a special guest for a number of months now. His name is Bob Vernon.
[time=777] That's right, Peter, and he's had a tremendous impact here in the city of Fort Wayne. On Thursday night, he met with area law enforcement men and women and spoke with them.
[time=787] And then, Friday, he had two different meetings with businessmen and around the city, and then he's been with us at our men's retreat.
[time=793] Some 200 men and he's back in our service today to speak to our church family.
[time=797] Now, just to be very clear on what we mean by today, as we're recording this on April 18th, Bob Vernon will be in our morning worship service.
[time=805] So, if you're watching this program today on television, you can still have time to come and be in our services at 9/15 or 10/50.
[time=815] And here, Bob Vernon, the assistant chief of police of the Los Angeles Police Department.
[time=821] And while we're talking about him, he just recently released a book entitled LA Justice.
[time=826] This was written with some of the lessons that were learned during the Rodney King episode, a year or so ago, in Los Angeles, and how it's really affected the Christian family.
[time=838] This book is available through the Bible hour, during the month of April, and you can receive it by sending a donation of $15 to the Bible hour.
[time=847] At 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=854] Once again, just right for the book, LA Justice, right to the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=867] I hope that you can join us for his live message here again on Sunday morning, April 18th at 9/15 or 10/50.
[time=876] Let's go back now to the live portion of our service as we listen to Pastor Moore give his Easter message.
[time=906] From the moment men first disobeyed the Father.
[time=913] We were then held captive by our sins.
[time=920] The law of God demanded a sacrifice restoring to Himself His own again.
[time=938] So the land God's only Son was freely offered.
[time=945] Atonement for our sin, forever made.
[time=952] He innocent and holy, still God and God only could ran some and redeem us back again.
[time=969] Alleluia praise the Lamb. Alleluia praise the Lamb.
[time=983] My heart sees this praise again. Alleluia praise the Lamb.
[time=999] So to the cross, they carried Him with all our guilt and all our sin.
[time=1009] The Lamb of God was slain for our transgressions.
[time=1016] And on that cross, those nail pierced hands, reached up to God and down to man.
[time=1024] And just as if I'd never sin, He took man's arms, embracing me willingly for gain.
[time=1041] We all first seek grace and love that knows no bounds.
[time=1048] Though guilty and condemned, I'm now in free.
[time=1055] For ever I'm forgiven, for Christ the Lord is risen, and risen with Him we will one day be.
[time=1072] Alleluia praise the Lamb. Alleluia praise the Lamb.
[time=1087] My heart will see His grace again. Alleluia praise the Lamb.
[time=1102] Alleluia praise the Lamb. Alleluia praise the Lamb.
[time=1116] My heart will see His grace again. Alleluia praise the Lamb. Alleluia praise the Lamb.
[time=1138] My heart will see His grace again. Alleluia praise the Lamb.
[time=1157] Praise the Lamb.
[time=1168] Amen. Thank you, Denise.
[time=1179] I don't know if you caught it last night, but CNN trying to be contemporary and responding to the season here with Easter,
[time=1189] ran a little three or four minute blurb on the connection, the mysterious connection between the Easter bunny and Easter.
[time=1197] They were trying to figure out where did the Easter bunny come from, I mean why the Easter bunny, how did he get tied into this whole picture.
[time=1204] And what was so amazing is nobody knew. They took their reporter to a mall and there was an Easter bunny there,
[time=1211] and there were kids and parents and pictures being taken and candy being given out of typical scene.
[time=1216] And the reporter began to ask around and they even asked the Easter bunny.
[time=1219] And the Easter bunny didn't know how he got to be associated with Easter.
[time=1224] And the kids sitting on the lap of the Easter bunny, they didn't know why the Easter bunny was associated.
[time=1231] The parents didn't know. The people taking the pictures didn't know. They finally called a local library.
[time=1236] Because they figured if anybody would know, the librarian would know. They called the library and she didn't know.
[time=1242] But she dug around her books and edited as this thing was. It finally came back that the Easter bunny got tied to Easter.
[time=1250] They think. They don't really know. But they think it's tied to an ancient Egyptian fertility cult of an ancient religion.
[time=1258] And it's associated with spring because with spring comes the new life and the flowers and the grass and all the stuff that happens and winters finally over in growth and new life.
[time=1267] And so to symbolize the new life, they picked the most prolific animal they could think of and it happened to have been a bunny.
[time=1272] And so we have now this Easter bunny.
[time=1276] What I found most interesting about this little clip was not that nobody knew because I didn't know. Maybe you knew. I didn't know.
[time=1284] I was just like everybody else. I don't know. But what seemed most amazing to me was that nobody seemed to care that they didn't know.
[time=1293] In other words, it didn't seem to matter to anybody that this holiday had religious roots or that there had been at one time real meaning and significance to Easter in these people's minds as they looked back to ancient Egypt.
[time=1307] It really just appeared to be another thing that the people in the 90s frantically run to and do. Oh, it's Easter this weekend. Okay, we'll just frantically run and do this along with 90,000 other things that we've got to do this weekend.
[time=1319] I came across a little description of life in the 90s. See if it fits. You feel like life is whizzing past you at 90 miles an hour.
[time=1328] You work 90 hours a week and you still have 90 things to do on your to-do list.
[time=1333] You're on a 90 calorie a day diet because you look 90 pounds overweight in your swimsuit.
[time=1340] You have 90 different bills to pay and you're already 90 dollars overdrawn in your checking account. The interest payment alone on your Visa card is 90 dollars this month.
[time=1352] You're still paying 90 dollars a month on your college loan and you have absolutely no idea where you're going to get the 90,000 dollars to send your own kids to college.
[time=1363] You've got 90 channels on your television. There's still nothing worthwhile to watch. You drive your kids to 90 different activities and events every month and your toddler has just asked why for the 90th time today.
[time=1383] And you're absolutely certain. You're sure. You're positive that if you could just find a way to make 90,000 dollars a year, everything would be okay.
[time=1393] Are you living in the 90s? Sound familiar. The frantic rush of the 90s may in fact be more than happenstance. It may kind of be a needed anesthetic.
[time=1408] We may need to be rushing from one thing to the next because if we're rushing from one thing to the next, we don't have to slow down long enough to ask ourselves some really important questions about the 90s, for example.
[time=1424] Why is it that a group of young, athletic, clean cut looking high school boys in Lakewood, California formed themselves in a little group called the spur posse?
[time=1438] The whole purpose for which is to see how many girls they can have sex with before they graduate from high school.
[time=1447] They're telling us about the 90s and about the people who live in the 90s and how one of them reported to have brought it up to the number of 60 gals.
[time=1458] And if queried as to why are you guys doing this, they could very easily say, well, that's what our role models are doing.
[time=1466] Don't you remember when Wilk Chamberlain came out and publicly said he'd had sex with 20,000 women in his lifetime, at least that's what he estimated?
[time=1475] And wasn't it imagine Johnson who just came out not too long ago and said that his problem with AIDS was the result of a incredibly loose moral standard sleeping with women?
[time=1484] Some he never even knew their name.
[time=1487] We're just doing what our role models are doing.
[time=1491] I mean, they could say to us, aren't these the great athletes that you as a society are lifting up and paying millions of dollars and worshipping every Saturday and Sunday at the ballgame?
[time=1504] Why is it that one out of every three young ladies in America today will be molested by the time they're 18?
[time=1519] Why is it that 135,000 young people in America take weapons with them every day to high school?
[time=1528] Why is it that 21% of the young people surveyed in high schools today say they avoid using the restroom at all cost?
[time=1537] Because they're absolutely terrified of what may happen to them if they go inside the restroom.
[time=1545] Why is it that 40% of the gals in America are going to be pregnant by the time they're 19? And here's a real tough question that if we just slowed down a little while, we'd probably have to answer.
[time=1558] Why is it that in the last 30 years, the suicide rate among teens in America has gone up 300%.
[time=1575] The last 30 years, the 60s, the 70s, the 80s, and now just a small slice of the 90s.
[time=1586] Compare this with what teachers indicated in the 1940s. They were given a survey and said list the seven hurdles to education in your classroom today.
[time=1599] And then they asked it again of teachers in the 90s. Listen first to what the teachers in the 40s said. This is what's giving us a hard time communicating and educating our youth.
[time=1607] Number one on their list. Number one, the biggest problem talking out of turn. Number two, chewing gum in the classroom.
[time=1617] Number three, making noise in the classroom. Number four, running up and down the halls.
[time=1626] Number five, six and seven, getting out of line, wearing improper clothing, and that didn't mean scandalous clothing. That meant clothing that didn't fit probably the standards of dress code.
[time=1637] And number seven, failing to put the paper in the waste paper basket. Those are the big seven. That's what was really bothering the teachers in their pursuit of educating our children in the 1940s.
[time=1651] You ready for the list in the 90s? Number one problem, drugs. Number two problem, alcohol abuse. Number three problem, pregnancy.
[time=1667] Number four, suicide. Number five, six and seven, rape, robbery, and assault.
[time=1682] Believe it all my heart today, that our society needs to get passed a very superficial embracing of Easter. And grab a hold of something meaningful, something life changing, something worth living for.
[time=1705] I think it's time that our society admit that we've lost our way. That somehow in the last 35 years we've taken a horrible, wrong turn.
[time=1716] And that we no longer seem able to even grab a hold of anything called truth. Seems so elusive.
[time=1727] And that as a result of a wrong turn and a failure to find truth and discover truth and hang on to truth, we're now all beginning to live lives that are really questionable.
[time=1737] Quality of life in America for ourselves and for the youth of this great nation. Seems fast in decline.
[time=1749] I don't know if you have your Bible with you this morning, but if you do, I'd ask you just to turn to John chapter 14 and look at a verse there.
[time=1757] This Sunday we're going to focus obviously on the person of Christ. But rather than try to survey his life, I want to focus in on one simple statement that he made.
[time=1767] One simple statement. One sentence in all of his teachings. And I hope it makes some sense to you this morning.
[time=1779] John chapter 14 verse 6. Jesus said this, I am the way. I am the truth. And I am the life.
[time=1794] And no man comes under the Father. But by me. I am the way. I am the truth. And I am the life.
[time=1806] For the few minutes it remained this morning if I could just talk a little bit about what I think Jesus meant when he said that he was the way the truth in the life.
[time=1814] First of all, I am the way. I am the way. I grew up in California in a little place called the Santianes Valley. It's about 15 miles long. It's about seven miles wide.
[time=1826] It's surrounded by a 3,000 foot mountain range that just over the one side of that mountain range you'd ascend into the city of Santa Barbara and then the Pacific Ocean.
[time=1835] It was undiscovered for many years. But eventually the people of Los Angeles and kind of the big famous people discovered the smog-free, beautiful rolling hills of the Santianes Valley.
[time=1845] So everybody started moving there. President Reagan had his ranch there. Many of you may have seen the Michael Jackson interview the other night and notice that he lives in the Santianes Valley.
[time=1856] Jimmy Connors lives there. Bo Derrick lives there. Whole lot of famous people live in the Santianes Valley. And in addition to that there's a little town called Solving inside the Valley.
[time=1866] It's what they call the Danish capital of America. It's built according to Danish architecture specifications. It's almost a duplication of Denmark.
[time=1875] So as people travel up and down the coast of California we see some 1 million visitors every single year coming to Solving.
[time=1883] I'll never forget being in a gas station there. I live there just filling up.
[time=1888] I have my window down. The gas station guy was helping me with this. This was some time ago.
[time=1893] One of these tourists rolled up into his gas station, rolled down the window and said, "Say, sir, could you tell me where President Reagan's ranch is?"
[time=1902] Why knew where President Reagan's ranch was? It was over there on that mountain.
[time=1907] The gas station attendant said, "Absolutely." His ranch is over there. If you just take a refugio down this way here until it tees take a left you'll come to it eventually.
[time=1918] I thought to myself, "That's a lie." That's a lie.
[time=1924] The guy in the tourist said, "Thank you very much, Mr. Gas Station attendant." I mean, not supposed to be able to trust those.
[time=1930] So rolled up his window, headed down refugio. I never saw a hurt from the guy. I'll tell you one thing. He did not find President Reagan's ranch.
[time=1938] He got locked into the wrong way. He got heading in the wrong direction.
[time=1943] Several hundred years ago some men stood up in the period we call the Enlightenment and they said that Jesus Christ is not the way.
[time=1953] For too many years we as humanity have been looking up to the transcendent values of God the Father and Jesus Christ the Son.
[time=1963] And these men like the gas station attendant in the same as Valley stood up and said, "That's not the way. The way is over here."
[time=1971] The first man to stand up was a man by a name of Emanuel Kant, one of the great philosophers, great in the sense in my opinion of notorious.
[time=1980] He said, "Stop looking up. Look inside for the way." If you want to find the way the truth and the life look within there's a compass inside of you.
[time=1989] It's called your mind and you cheap in humanity and you cheap in your own existence. You're smarter than needing to rely upon some transcendent values of God.
[time=2001] Look inside yourself, think the issue through, you're smarter than that, discern for yourself by looking within with the powers of your own rational capacities and set your course.
[time=2016] Kant pleaded with people to stop looking up and start looking within to the inner compass of the mind. His movement became known as rationalism.
[time=2026] Another man stood up in the Enlightenment period and said, "I agree with Kant. We've got to stop looking up. We've got to start looking within but not to the mind."
[time=2036] The Swiss-born philosopher Russo said, "Look to your emotions. It's your emotions. That's the compass. That's the key. Those are the internal instruments by which you can discover the way and the truth and the life.
[time=2051] We know it today in the little phrase, "If it feels good, do it." An entire generation, many of you are sitting here today of the sixties. Grab the hold of that and ran with it for all. It was worth.
[time=2062] And many of us to this day as a society are still running with it.
[time=2067] Russo said this now, "Children, you must understand our born intrinsically beautiful. They are like little flowers that if you will just water with good love and protect them from the harsh realities of an external oppressive religious system and remove from them the dominating, domineering influences are absolute truth."
[time=2088] These gorgeous, beautiful little children will just blossom into roses and sunflowers and miracles. Not weeds, dandelions, poison ivy and skunk weed.
[time=2103] Well, those of us with kids are saying, "Russo didn't know the first thing about kids. Did he? He's clueless. We've got those little ones. We know what they're really made of."
[time=2116] Russo said, "Your heart is bursting with goodness. Don't mess it up with religion and absolutes. Inner goodness will eventually, if you'll just follow your feelings, will eventually prevail and society will be good."
[time=2132] A third man stood up and said, "No, Jesus Christ isn't the way the truth and the life. I agree with these other philosophers. We must look it within but not the mind and not the emotions."
[time=2145] Frederick Nietzsche said, "You've got to look to your own will. You've got to power up and do it. You've got to choose and make your own rules by the power of your own will.
[time=2157] Take charge of your life, flex your volitional muscles, power up and do whatever you want to."
[time=2168] Isn't that strange? We shouldn't be celebrating as a society. America today, really. We shouldn't be celebrating Easter. We should be celebrating the enlightenment.
[time=2177] The thinking of these three men and their contemporaries, more dominate and more influence and more control and more shape and more direct the lifestyles of the people of America today than Christ, and certainly more than an Easter bunny.
[time=2195] We need a new holiday. A holiday to the enlightenment and we ought to give gifts and we ought to set aside a special day and dress a certain way and go certain places all in the memory.
[time=2206] Of the thinkers of the enlightenment.
[time=2213] So when Jesus says he is the way, he is saying to you, "Unlike someone who would falsely direct you to look back inside yourself, I stand at the apex of history, I am the only religious leader, I am the only philosopher, I am the only great teacher, I am the only whatever you want to call me."
[time=2235] Who predicted my own death and my own resurrection and fulfilled it.
[time=2244] Jesus Christ stands alone in that and he says, "I am the way. I am the way to life and I demonstrate that to you by being the one who overcame death."
[time=2256] Secondly, in this verse, Jesus said, "I am the truth. I am not only the way, but I am the truth." A study was recently taken of the people of our society, not just of what they thought was right and wrong, but what they actually practiced in their life to give evidence to what was really for them right and wrong.
[time=2275] Listen to the conclusion of the researchers. They said this, I quote, "In the 1950s and even in the early 60s, there was something much closer to a moral consensus in America."
[time=2285] But there's absolutely no moral consensus at all in the 1990s. Everyone is making up their own personal codes, everyone is making up their own ten commandments.
[time=2296] And so these researchers, having done all of this work and surveying the mentality and the practices of people thought they'd write up what really are the true ten commandments of the 1990s, based upon the practices of the people of the 1990s.
[time=2309] Here they are, you're ready, the new ten commandments. Number one, I don't see the point of observing the Sabbath.
[time=2316] Number two, I will steal from those who won't really miss it. Three out of four people say, "That's me. I do that. I steal from people when I don't believe they'll really miss it."
[time=2330] Number three, Commandment number three, I will lie when it suits me as long as it doesn't cause any real damage.
[time=2341] Commandment number four, I will drink and drive if I feel like I can handle it. Commandment number five, I will cheat on my spouse.
[time=2353] After all, given the chance he or she will surely cheat on me, 53% of the people said, "I live by that commandment."
[time=2366] Number six, I will procrastinate and do absolutely nothing in about one full day in five, speaking of the work environment.
[time=2374] Commandment number seven, I will use recreational drugs, 41% of the people surveyed said they do that.
[time=2381] Commandment number eight, I will cheat on my taxes to a point. Commandment number nine, 31% of the people say this.
[time=2391] I will put my lover at risk of disease. I mean, I sleep around a bit, but who doesn't?
[time=2402] Commandment number 10, technically, I may not have committed date rape, but I know that she really wanted it.
[time=2413] One out of five women in America today have been sexually assaulted in the context of a date.
[time=2421] They summon all this way, quote, "Almost all of us have a highly individualistic moral menu."
[time=2429] That's even couched in very contemporary terms. All of us, almost all of us, have a highly individualistic moral menu.
[time=2437] We decide, we decide what is right and what is wrong.
[time=2444] So truth is relative. You might be interested to know that only 13% of the people studied in this survey said they agree and tried to abide by the original 10 commandments in the Bible.
[time=2458] We've got a society of 250 million people, 87% of which are making their own rules, living by their own code, deciding in their own mind or in their own heart, their own emotions, or in their, by the power of their own will, what is right and what is wrong.
[time=2480] And what kind of a life does it give? Point number three, and the little sentence of the Lord, "I am the way, the truth in the life." I don't know, you tell me.
[time=2487] If you're the two little twins living in Philadelphia, nine months old, and you happen to irritate your father one too many times, so your dad picked you up and threw you across the room, and you collided with the wall in your house.
[time=2502] Babies don't do very good with walls. Those little babies were rushed to the hospital but died several days later.
[time=2509] Kind of a life is that. What kind of a life is it when you're driving down the streets of Chicago or better yet pulling out of your own driveway in your own house in a suburb of Chicago and some men decide they want to have your car.
[time=2525] It's the latest, you know, car jacking. I don't know if you read about it, but they ripped the woman out of her car and jumped in and they were in such a hurry to get going that somehow she didn't break free of the car and she was caught.
[time=2537] And they were driving down the road, dragging this woman. They finally pulled over close enough to a fence so she could hit the fence and be loosened from the automobile.
[time=2549] A few minutes later down the road, they noticed that her child and her 18-month-old child was in the back and that wasn't part of the bargain, so they picked the baby up and threw it out the window and never even stopped.
[time=2558] Kind of a life. What kind of a life is it?
[time=2563] Now I don't know if these people powered up in their own will. I don't know if they went with their feelings. I don't know if they rationalized their way to this behavior, but they did and they want you to do the same.
[time=2575] Let's be fair about this now. There is no particular way and there is no particular truth and so therefore you're free to think it through or feel it through or power it through any way you want to to have the kind of life you want to have.
[time=2589] Not too long ago in the city of New York a family was visiting, showing the stench of liberty and all the great sites of the marvellously diverse city of New York and they were in a subway traveling from one place to another but there were some teenage boys in New York City who wanted to go dancing that night.
[time=2610] But they didn't have any money to get into dancing so they went down to the subway and they came across this little family from Utah. They whipped out their knives and started slashing and cutting until they got the money they wanted and when they were done the son of this family from Utah was dead and the father was bleeding to death.
[time=2630] You know what's worse? You know where those guys went that night? You know what they did when they left the subway? They went dancing.
[time=2639] What kind of a life is it? And you know until our society comes to its collective senses this stuff just keeps getting closer and closer to home.
[time=2651] You've read about a little bit of it already in the newspapers of Fort Wayne. I don't think we've seen the last of it.
[time=2660] When Jesus says some 2000 years ago predicting his own death, predicting his own resurrection that I am the one you can trust, I am the way, I am the truth, I am the life.
[time=2676] I just want to say to anybody who will listen to me, stop looking inside and start looking outside at the consequences of the inside look and let's look up together.
[time=2689] And find life and find truth and find the way in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2699] You know there's just one single verse in the Bible that reveals why an inside look will never work.
[time=2707] Just one little verse just shows exactly why an inside look will never work. It's Jeremiah 179. The heart is more deceitful than all else and is desperately sick.
[time=2719] The heart and the Old Testament Hebrew language was the word that they would use to describe the seat of your mental powers, your rational powers.
[time=2727] It was the seat of your emotional powers. It was the seat of your volitional powers. The heart and the Old Testament was the seat of everything that you are emotionally.
[time=2736] And mentally, rationally and volitionally. The Bible tells us that the heart is desperately sick.
[time=2746] In other words, when you look inside for the information, the values, clues, the way to find the way and the truth and the life, when you are looking inside, whether to your mind or to your will or to your emotions, the Bible is telling you you are looking in the wrong place.
[time=2761] You are giving yourself too much credit. The Enlightenment era gave us all too much credit to suggest we needed to stop looking to the answers for transcend values from God and start looking within.
[time=2776] We have all been led on a tragic goose chase of absolute nothing and I don't know if you are ready to admit it, I am the last 35 years and this country has been an unmitigated disaster.
[time=2791] When are we going to wake up and stop looking within and start looking up?
[time=2800] The first step in all of that is to admit that my heart is desperately sick. Did you know that? The first step in turning your life and beginning to turn this society around is with the admission that my heart is desperately sick.
[time=2814] My heart is not a reliable compass for navigating the course of life. Now that is a tough admission to make. My dad was a pilot, a private pilot. He had a little Sesna 182 that he would use in his business.
[time=2830] I can remember countless mornings he and I would sit together on the runway there in the city and his valley waiting to take off whether I was going to go to work with him that day or whether we were going to go snow skiing or whether we were going to go visit some friends, whatever we were going to do.
[time=2842] I remember we would get there early in the morning and we'd sit there all revved up and ready to go and we were waiting for something. You know what it was? Sunrise.
[time=2851] My dad was not instrument-rated. In other words, my dad couldn't fly at night and he couldn't fly through the clouds.
[time=2857] He had to fly visually and with no light there's no vision so we couldn't take off and I remember as a little impatient kid wanting to get where we were going saying, "Come on dad! It's almost done!
[time=2868] It's always going to be, by the time we get the altitude, it'll be light! Let's go!"
[time=2875] He said, "No, we can't go yet, Russell. I'm not instrument-rated." I can remember my dad leaving the house for work and he'd have just with him his briefcase for a day's journey. He was planning to go to the airport and hop over the mountains over to a place called Fresno which was a five hour drive in the car but it was about a 45 minute flight in his plane.
[time=2894] That's why he got the plane. He wanted to be home at night and spend time with the kids.
[time=2898] I can remember seeing him go to work saying, "Hey, I'll see you later today, Russ. See you tonight for dinner." I said, "Great day."
[time=2904] 15 minutes later he'd come back in the house. I said, "What's happened?" He said, "Well, I got to the airport, got the plane set up, checked in with the people to tell me all about the weather."
[time=2913] They said, "It's all fogged in over there in Fresno." There was a remote chance it might break. You know, I could maybe find my way down through the clouds but not on.
[time=2921] He'd go to his bedroom. He'd pack his bag. He'd get in his car. He'd drive five hours and come back three days later.
[time=2931] Oh man, what a lesson. The beginning is to admit that you're not capable of navigating your own life.
[time=2942] I'll never forget the day. We're sitting around the house and he was reading the paper. He said, "Come on over here."
[time=2948] I sat down next to him and he said, "What's that headline say?" Very clear, Fletcher Jones dies in aircraft crash.
[time=2959] Fletcher Jones, he was another one of those really big names in the St. Nicholas Valley. Fletcher Jones had made some technological breakthrough into the computer chip many years ago.
[time=2968] He made $40 million in four years. That's a lot today. Imagine what that was 20 years ago.
[time=2976] He was brilliant. He owned his own company. He had a lear jet there at the airport and he also had a nifty little single engine plane which for some reason he had chosen to take the Los Angeles to be a part of some big political fundraiser for the Republican party.
[time=2992] He got into his plane that night and checked in with the people that told him about the weather and they said that the Santianez Valley is fogged in.
[time=3002] With some ridiculously low ceiling of a couple hundred feet. But see, Fletcher Jones, he didn't know how to admit that he couldn't navigate his own life so he got his plane.
[time=3015] He took off up the coast of California. The last they ever heard from him was in a little town called Oxnard when he radioed into Verify's location.
[time=3023] The next morning, when the fog lifted, all they could find of Fletcher Jones was a half dollar size of his skull.
[time=3034] They don't know exactly how the accident happened but they believe that he got into the fog and his plane got inverted.
[time=3039] When you're flying in the air like that, you don't even know you're inverted. You can't feel it. You think, "Oh, my seatbelt." No, you don't even know it.
[time=3047] And he thought he was too low so he pulled back on his stick. Which when your right set up, makes you go up. When you're upside down, it makes you go down.
[time=3055] They believe that he knows dive right into flat land. Brilliant man, successful man.
[time=3064] But he never came to the place where he could admit to himself, "You know what? There are limitations to my navigational abilities."
[time=3074] I hope it's obvious to you this morning that there are some significant limitations to the navigational abilities of the heart and the inside look.
[time=3083] And what we need desperately is that refreshing, liberating, admission, we can't do it. We need to look up to the person of Jesus Christ who is the way the truth in the life and accept his transcendent values and principles of life.
[time=3099] If you know something, the government of the United States of America cannot make any policy so strong that it can hold the families of America together.
[time=3108] Did you know that? There's nothing they can do in Washington that can hold the families of Fort Wayne together. But I know and believe with all my heart because I have seen it with my own eyes that the person of Jesus Christ can hold families together.
[time=3121] This church is full of them. This church is full of people who before they knew the way the truth in the life, we're living right here in the Black Hawk area and these little homes all scattered out in this part of our town.
[time=3132] And their kids were downstairs beaten on drums and playing loud guitars and who knows what else was going on down there.
[time=3141] Unlike probably not unlike all the other kids in the country doing the drug thing and the sex thing and feeling empty and maybe they were just a little bit of a time bomb waiting to take their own life.
[time=3153] And the moms and the dads in that home were so frustrated and exacerbated by the children and by their own lack of relationship that they were talking about divorce.
[time=3164] And no government policy in the world could change that situation. But those people came to Christ. They met the way they met the truth and they met the life.
[time=3178] And those kinds of people now populate this church and they're held together.
[time=3185] You realize that no criminal institution in the United States of America can regenerate or renew or revive our criminals. They sit inside the prisons and they waste away and they just learn more about crime and they learn more about hate and they learn more about all the things that brought them there in the first place.
[time=3204] But I believe with all my heart because I've seen it with my own eyes. I've seen the person of Jesus Christ take a convicted criminal, a drug addict, a drug dealer and an adulterer and absolutely totally revolutionizes life to where today he has a wife that he loves and kids that he's raising and he's an elder in a church somewhere in Southern California.
[time=3228] And Jesus says I am the way the truth and the life he means it. You know something folks this whole idea of safe sex which has got to be the biggest myth I've ever heard of in my life is not the policy to help the youth of America today.
[time=3247] I can't do it. You know who can do it. Jesus Christ can do it. I've seen with my own eyes college student after college student after college student running and throwing their lives away and all the trash of this world thinking they've got life by the tail when in reality it's got them by the tail and they're living out a real short fuse.
[time=3268] And I've seen those kids get down on their knees and say I can't navigate my life. I'm only 16 but I've seen what it's doing already.
[time=3277] I need the way I need the truth and I need the life and I've seen those kids turn 180 degrees.
[time=3283] Go on through high school finish college and now living productive godly lives.
[time=3294] Let me just make it real clear God there is a god in heaven despite what Nietzsche said. He's alive and he loves you with all his heart.
[time=3303] And he has given in the word of God these transcendent values that you can bank on that you can live your life by.
[time=3313] And you say to yourself that may be true but I've broken so many of you know my life you're talking about society in general you could be talking about my life.
[time=3321] Well that's what the cross is all about because not only is there a god the father in heaven there's a god the son who came to earth and died to pay the price for our violating all of these principles.
[time=3331] And just to punctuate the fact that he can forgive you of your sins he was raised from the dead.
[time=3337] But there's better news than that there's not just god the father up there and god the whole god the god the son there's got the Holy Spirit.
[time=3344] And when you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior when you bend the knee and say I can't navigate my life I need help.
[time=3350] And the help needs to come to me in the person of Jesus Christ and you accept Christ as your Savior the Spirit of God the Holy Spirit takes up residence inside your heart and he empowers you to live these principles.
[time=3363] He'll give you the strength day in and day out to live according to the word of God.
[time=3370] I believe with all my heart it's time for America it's time for you to get past a very superficial approach to Easter.
[time=3379] And let the Easter bunny be who he is or what he is or how he is and get past all that and come to Christ because Easter is really all about the resurrection of the living Lord Jesus Christ and through him you can find the way the truth and the life.
