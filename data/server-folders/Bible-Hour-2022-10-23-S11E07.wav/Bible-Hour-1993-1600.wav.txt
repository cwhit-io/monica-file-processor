[time=0] He didn't say, "In this world system, now that you're following me, everything's going
[time=16] to be easy for you." No, to the contrary, he says, "In this world system, you shall have tribulation.
[time=22] That's life.
[time=25] It's gospel of prosperity and wealth and ease is not biblical, folks.
[time=31] If you're coming to church thinking that everything is going to be from now on, easy, you've been deceived."
[time=42] Welcome to the Bible out, an hour of Bible study, Music and Fellowship, which we hope
[time=56] you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=58] Thank you for joining us.
[time=60] Much has been written about the social and moral decline of America today.
[time=64] What does the Bible say about a nation that turns away from its commitment to God's principles?
[time=69] Today with us, as our special guest Robert Vernon shares with us six signs from the Bible of a society in decline.
[time=75] Bob is the former Assistant Chief of Police in Los Angeles.
[time=79] He brings a unique and timely perspective on this issue and light of recent current events.
[time=83] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Isaiah so that you can study along with us.
[time=91] Our special music today will be provided by Scott Schindler.
[time=96] Let us now join the Sanctuary Choir as we begin our service.
[time=275] I am so glad that you joined us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=278] We have been anticipating this day and just a few moments you will be hearing from the former assistant police chief of the Los Angeles City Police Department, Bob Vernon.
[time=288] But before we talk about him and hear his message today, I want to tell you about a special event that is coming up in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=296] Always get excited when we talk about the children.
[time=299] We are going to have a children's musical on Sunday evening May 2nd.
[time=303] This is the King's Kids Choir, grades 1, 2, and 3.
[time=307] They are presenting the musical Good Kings Come in Small Packages.
[time=311] I hope that if you don't regularly attend church on Sunday night that you will join with us for this great musical on Sunday evening May 2nd at 6 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk
[time=321] Baptist Church.
[time=323] Then as I mentioned in just a few moments you are going to hear from the assistant police chief Bob Vernon.
[time=329] And I know that you are going to be excited by his message.
[time=332] Just about a year ago we had the arrest of Rodney King and most of you know about that situation
[time=338] that created great tensions in the city of Los Angeles.
[time=343] And at that time assistant police chief Bob Vernon was involved and he has made some observations about that arrest and subsequent events that took place.
[time=353] And he also suggests that what happens in a large city such as Los Angeles can happen right
[time=359] here even in Fort Wayne.
[time=361] And he suggests some of the events that have taken place that have concerned him and also concerned us as Christians.
[time=368] But there are solutions to it.
[time=369] So I hope that you will write for this book today.
[time=372] It's entitled LA Justice written by assistant police chief of the LA Police Department Bob Vernon. You can receive it by writing to the Bible hour today at 7400 East State, Fort
[time=385] Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=390] Once again the address is the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip
[time=397] code is 46815.
[time=401] We had a tremendous time this last weekend with police chief Bob Vernon in our men's retreat
[time=407] and it certainly was a stimulus for the 210 men that gathered together and was an encouragement
[time=413] to us.
[time=414] You're going to hear him in just a few moments but I hope you'll write for the book and send a donation to the Bible hour of $15.
[time=421] Thank you for joining us.
[time=422] We go back to the live portion of our service now.
[time=451] Thank you.
[time=467] [MUSIC - 129 seconds]
[time=606] [APPLAUSE - 16 seconds]
[time=636] Well you were asked to pray and I know you have been for some time for chief Vernon's visit to the city of Fort Wayne and I just am so happy and thankful that I can report back to you that God has been using this man in our city in a great way.
[time=651] Thursday as you know he met with the area law enforcement officers and just gave a great rundown on his perspective of what happened with the Rodney King incident and the riot and what happened wrong and what happened right and by the way he's cataloged all that in a book that he's recently written and we have that on a book table out there for you if you'd like to get that from a source other than the press.
[time=676] And then Friday he had two different meetings with CBMC gatherings one in the morning and then a large one at noon with some 250 guys in which the gospel was so wonderfully presented and I know men made responses in their hearts to Christ.
[time=691] And then Friday night and all day Saturday all day yesterday he was sharing with over 200 men from our church many of you of course were there and we saw firsthand just in our own hearts what God was doing in response to this man's ministry.
[time=705] And I just want to report back to you thank you for your prayers and the strength of this church as we try to stand behind some unique opportunities that it is for us to impact the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=716] Bob Vernon his father served on the Los Angeles Police Department for some 20 years.
[time=724] Chief Vernon himself served 38 years with the Los Angeles Police Department he rose up through the ranks from rookie officer to the second in command of one of the nation's largest and most respected police departments.
[time=739] Chief Vernon is a graduate of the University of Southern California's managerial policy institute he's also graduated from the FBI's national executive institute and also holds an MBA from Pepperdine University.
[time=754] He's married to his wife Esther he has two grown children seven grandchildren and he and Esther live in Pasadena California.
[time=764] His interest in police work came at his father's knee listening to the stories that were told him of his father's work day.
[time=772] His recently published book LA Justice Lessons Lessons from the Firestorm as I have told you is available today at catalogs and gives insight marvelous inside into society as he cleans it from the whole Rodney King incident and the riots.
[time=788] Beyond that formal introduction I just am so thankful that I have had the privilege of knowing Bob Vernon for some 12 or 13 years as we got to know each other at Grace Community Church.
[time=799] And as I was a young aspiring man in the ministry had the privilege of looking at this man's life and the way God was using it in my city and he has stood from that day as he does today as a great contemporary Joseph of the Old Testament or a Daniel.
[time=817] A man who didn't go into the priesthood so to speak didn't go through seminary and become a preacher though God has marvelously gifted him in his study of the word of God and his ability to communicate that.
[time=828] But in the secular workforce to rise up and to stand for Christ and the principles of Christ has been a great encouragement to my heart through the years and I'm thankful that he can be here with us this morning.
[time=840] Would you give a warm black hawk welcome to chief Vernon.
[time=858] This is kind of a reverse usually I wire somebody they don't wire me but today I'm wearing how many men were to retreat which raised your hands let show them how it's done.
[time=868] Good morning troops.
[time=870] All right, nothing made me feel better.
[time=873] You ladies didn't have to get involved in that it's all right.
[time=877] Well, it's indeed a pleasure to be here Fort Wayne, Indiana. What a great place, middle America, solid earth.
[time=887] We're all kind of you know the rest of America kind of depends on this stability of not only the food that you grow and everything else but the values that you still endure yourself to here in middle America and what a wonderful place to be in many ways I envy you.
[time=906] Probably some of you are wondering this guy is a cop what's he doing up here behind the pulpit what's the cop going to say from the Bible is there such thing as a cop that can talk about the Bible.
[time=919] I just want you to know that police officers many of them believers a lot of them what I call American Christians you know what American Christian is.
[time=929] It's like I was for a number of years like my dad you know it says on our coins in God we trust.
[time=934] So if you're an American I mean you know you believe in God and not only that you go to church once in a while.
[time=941] Friend of mine came to me when I said that as I was a young man and said look if going to church make you a Christian then going into a garage on a make you a car right.
[time=948] I thought I won't wait a minute it doesn't make sense here you know.
[time=951] And thirdly I believe then I think most police officers believe but a dear elderly lady came up to me one day and said Bob Vernon I've heard you say you believe.
[time=960] I want you to read this verse and you open the Bible to the book of James and I've memorized this verse not because it means so much to me it says you believe in one God you do well.
[time=970] You do well is kind of King James for a big deal yeah the devil's believe and tremble.
[time=976] And so I thought whoa there's something else there's something deeper than just believing just being American just going to church.
[time=983] And you know there's a lot of police officers like me who have realized there's more to that than just being an American Christian.
[time=989] In fact it's just a few weeks ago we were gathered at Hume Lake we had over 500 nearly 500 police officers counting their wives we had about 40 on a waiting list because we couldn't get them all in.
[time=1002] And we had a retreat there to talk about principles from the Bible just cops and their wives and some female officers with their spouses.
[time=1010] And what a time it was we always have a good time getting together one of the things that happens when cops get together it gets get together as they share cops stories.
[time=1020] I don't know why it always happens the war stories you know and it's kind of who can top you this you know one year this was several years ago we had a contest who could tell the most far out is weirdest yet true cops story.
[time=1033] Of course that last condition through a lot of us out of the competition but the guy that won that year had two or three people who were from the same department that testified that what he was telling was true and not an exaggeration.
[time=1045] Seems as though they had chased abandoned through the streets of their city he had finally got to his house he had hold up there in his house barricaded himself.
[time=1052] He was shooting at the police officers outside so they had what we call a barricaded man situation they set up a command post across the street in the parking lot of a church interestingly enough.
[time=1061] And there was about a four foot masonry brick wall that they were all huddled behind and they called for the sergeant the sergeant got there and they said what happened here he said well this guy we chased him back from committing this robbery and he's over there in that house and he's shooting at us he won't come out we've evacuated the house on either side we got officers back in the alley we got the place around it.
[time=1078] He said wait I know who that is give me the bullhorn that's Joe what's his name you know any grab for the bullhorn they said sergeant sergeant better stay down he he's been shooting at us this time is yeah but I know this guy hey Joe this is sergeant so and so knock off the foolish man get out of there and about that time a shot ring out in a bullet ricochet off the wall and he dropped to his knees and he said I see what you mean Joe's mad this time okay let's go on from there look bring me the gas kit so one of the officers went to the office of the sergeant's car and brought out this big what we call it's it federal is the company that makes it federal gas.
[time=1107] And it has a launcher that looks like an oversized shotgun that breaks in and there's three kinds of missiles you can put in there the first one is a missile it doesn't even leave the barrel of the gun just the end pops off of the shell and gas feels room we're using in close situations like a room like this normally we don't gas church groups but I mean if we had to you know we used to deal like that then there's the medium rain shell it's good for about 50 yards.
[time=1132] It comes out very slow rate of speed if it hits someone it doesn't kill him it tumbles and over and you can actually see it going through the air it has slits down the side tear gas comes from out the slits it turns real hot so they're not supposed to throw it back but somebody always finds a glove and throws it back at us you know but anyhow that's the kind of probably should have been used then there's what we call a flight right projector you fire that thing and it comes out of the end of the barrel and three fin snap into place there's a rocket charge boost it good for about 200 yards.
[time=1158] So the sergeant said get the gas kitten let's see don't shoot it here we've we've got the street between us and the house and then we've got the lawn.
[time=1167] You might miss a window taking around in the alley and fired in through one of the back windows the officer said yes sir.
[time=1174] So we took the gas kitten he went back in the alley and he got all set up there you know the sergeant got out the megaphone he said Joe we're going to use the gas.
[time=1182] Get serious now man come on out why you have a chance you got one more chance are you coming out.
[time=1188] Bam another shot rang up you pull it ricocheted off the wall he said fire the gas.
[time=1192] Kid in the back look down in the gas kid he grabbed the first shell it was there it was the wrong one it was a flight right project.
[time=1198] He put it in there you know close the gun got it up to a shoulder aimed at the window in the back door fired this shell.
[time=1205] It came out at the end of the gun three fin snapped into place a rocket charge took off he missed the window in the back door.
[time=1211] Hit just below the window and apply with thing it was just a flimsy back door on a porch like area you know.
[time=1217] It blew a hole about that being an applied one streaking through into the door was open between the back porch and the kitchen went into the kitchen.
[time=1223] There were cafe doors between the kitchen in the dining room went rocketing through the dining room.
[time=1229] Glance off the wall went over glance off the wall of the entry hall hit the front door which was a hollow corridor.
[time=1234] Bull hole at big in the hollow corridor went across the street hit the wall and gased all the cops behind the wall.
[time=1252] We said you win this year.
[time=1256] We gave him the award pick up your bibles if you will and turn to Isaiah the fifth chapter and before we get into the book.
[time=1263] I always like to pray before I read the Bible.
[time=1267] God wrote it through men but God inspired it.
[time=1273] And I always like to ask the author to be here would you join me.
[time=1277] Father as we open your book the one that you designed wrote.
[time=1282] Given for our identification Lord bless us as we look to it and as we learn from your principles.
[time=1290] I acknowledge that nothing that I can say from my human wisdom will really do any good here.
[time=1296] But you know all you're the God of the universe we depend on you.
[time=1301] You be the teacher in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=1306] Chief Parker was one of the great chiefs of L.A.P.D. that rocketed the police department to its predominance and preeminence in law enforcement throughout the world.
[time=1316] William H. Parker.
[time=1318] He had a favorite book.
[time=1321] It was called The Blind Eye of History.
[time=1326] You can kind of get an idea what the book was about when you just look at the title.
[time=1332] We don't seem to learn from history do we?
[time=1336] Noted historians will an aerial Durant very famous in Southern California because they did most of their work at the University of Southern California in history.
[time=1344] And Arnold Toine Bee from England and all the other great historians you can amass together have kind of together identified certain conditions that occur in a society before it becomes unraveled and begins to come apart.
[time=1358] It happens over and over again and we seem to not learn for the mistakes of those that have gone on before us.
[time=1365] Did you know that these six classic causes of national decline for the first time as far as I know are recorded in the Bible.
[time=1374] Here in the fifth chapter of Isaiah we have what Bible scholars refer to as the six rows of Isaiah 5.
[time=1381] A whoa is a warning. It means look out, beware.
[time=1388] And here we have an Isaiah 5, six warnings. Israel was much in the condition that America is in right now.
[time=1396] Maybe a little further down the skids but they had reached their peak during David and Solomon and then they had begun to fall from within to decay.
[time=1406] They turned from God. They turned from their commitment to him and his principles. Some of them are already taken into captivity by the time this was written.
[time=1415] But they were still intact as a nation and Isaiah was sent to give them a warning to call attention to the six reasons that they were covering from within.
[time=1424] The first one is in verse 8. He says whoa, this is the first whoa, whoa to those who add house to house and join field of field until there is no more room. Stop right there for a minute.
[time=1433] What is he saying? He is talking about the overdevelopment of the real estate market. Now he says there is no more room.
[time=1440] There was as much dirt as there was before. There was as much Palestine as there was before he said this. What is he saying?
[time=1446] He is saying there is no more room for young people to get into the real estate market. You guys have overdeveloped it.
[time=1451] You have raised the prices too high. Develop, develop, develop. Not what kind of a nice house can we put here on this lot to make the most beautiful but how many 8,000 condos can we put in these three square miles?
[time=1462] To get the most money and raise the price. So today young people have to get a special loan from their parents or from the government some kind of first mortgage loan or something because they just can't afford it.
[time=1475] And mothers have to leave the home where they are really needed to take care of their children because we add house to house and join field of field until there is no more room.
[time=1487] What is he describing? He is really describing the cult of materialism. And students of history will tell you you can always tell when a society is becoming too materialistically because the prices of real estate skyrocket. They are connected somehow.
[time=1505] That is not familiar. Look at the next world. Verse 11, "Wooders who rise early in the morning that wine may inflame them who pursue strong drink, who stay up in the evening that wine may inflame them and their banquets are accompanied by liar and harp and by tambourine and flutin by wine.
[time=1522] But they do not pay attention to the deeds of the Lord and do they consider the work of his hand." Here they describe, he describes, a hedonistic society. A society bent on pleasure and it is really interesting the way he describes this. He says they mix intoxicants with music for pleasure's sake.
[time=1542] And today, at least in California, the rock concerts. That is exactly what is happening.
[time=1548] The music is mixed with various kinds of intoxicants, marijuana, cocaine, alcohol, whatever it is. Get loaded, dig the vibes.
[time=1559] And we are so much into being entertained we can't even walk down the street with having your phones on, plugging in and listen to the music.
[time=1567] It seems as if it is a priority in our lives. In fact, someone has observed you can kind of tell about a society's values when you see and ask the question, who is really getting the biggest rewards, who is getting the highest salaries and of course in our society.
[time=1581] We pay people $3 million a year to play games for us. Or to sing for us, to make us feel good, to entertain us.
[time=1591] And a person who devotes their life to finding a cure for the HIV virus, if they are lucky 35,000 a year, and a plaque, when they find it, thanks a lot Joe for saving the human race. Really appreciate it.
[time=1603] But the person who plays a game, bring a million bucks. How's that sound? No, 4 million. No, 3 million is not enough.
[time=1609] I am not saying it is evil to play a game, but I am saying it tells you about a society's priorities.
[time=1616] Verse 18, "Woe to those who drag a niquity with cords of falsehood and sin as if with cart ropes, who say, 'Let him make speed. Let him hasten his work." In other words, God zapped me.
[time=1627] And he gives you a word picture. I want you to see this. He says, "It's like you've taken a cart, and you've put your sin on it, and then you put ropes next to that cart, so you can drag it with you everywhere you go."
[time=1639] In other words, something different is happening in America. I think this is just risen in the last five or six years. We've always been imperfect. All of us know we're not perfect.
[time=1648] We've always had things we're ashamed of, but you know what we do today as a country? We get on nationwide TV, and we tell a world about what we should be ashamed of.
[time=1657] We go on the Phil Donahue show and say, "Yeah, let me tell you about my sexual perversion. Let me tell you about my kink."
[time=1666] And we're unashamed about it. In fact, we boast about it. I'm more evil than you. No, I'm more evil than you.
[time=1675] That's a new phenomenon in America. And it's an indicator of a society in trouble, according to God's Word.
[time=1683] Verse 20, "Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness, who substitute bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter."
[time=1691] We literally reverse right and wrong. You say, "Well, at least we haven't got that far." Oh, yeah. We have a vice president that says, "We had one," that says, "You know, it's good for a man and woman to be committed to one another for life and to have children in that arrangement. It's good for the children."
[time=1709] And he is ridiculed. It's like, "What a jerk. That's passé. That's a hazy inherent. That's dumb."
[time=1719] And a TV program that features someone called Murphy Brown, who decides, "I'm going to have this child without a father."
[time=1730] "Hooray for you, Murphy Brown." And she's cheered. And she's championed like she's a hero right and wrong or reversed.
[time=1738] And in Los Angeles, last June, and from from here they're on, every June they say, "We're going to have an entire month devoted to gay, pride, month."
[time=1748] And our children are going to be taught what homosexuality is all about, and that it's a good alternative. And this is something you should consider, and it's okay.
[time=1756] A whole month from kindergarten through 12th grade. Right has become wrong. Wrong has become right.
[time=1766] Verse 21, "Wall to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight, and here he talks about arrogant elitism."
[time=1774] We see much of that. I think perhaps one of the most vivid illustrations I can give you. I was at a college not too long ago debating with a bunch of college students about legalizing drugs.
[time=1787] And I said, "You know, many people have wondered for years about the man in Aztec cultures and the Inca cultures they were at one time very advanced. They had a calendar.
[time=1798] We still haven't been able to fully duplicate as far as its accuracy and all that. They had incredible scientific knowledge. They had beautiful temples and buildings, and now those cities are overgrown with jungle.
[time=1808] Something happened, and for many years there's been all kind of theories of, "Why did it happen? What happened? What fell apart?"
[time=1817] And there were some theories that, well, it was a conquistorist that kind of messed things up. And they said, "No scientific evidence shows it was happening long before they came."
[time=1825] It was already on the way. Some people thought it's some kind of a virus, a plague, somehow they've been able to rule that out.
[time=1832] The latest, and they think the most viable theory is, the societies turn in mass to the use of drugs as part of the culture.
[time=1840] The Inca civilization, for instance, still choose the cocoally from which we get cocaine. And it's part of their culture, and it's okay, and it's adopted, and pretty soon they lost their motivation.
[time=1855] They would rather go out and look at a tree or hug a rock and just kind of be loaded.
[time=1861] And you know, I said, "We had to learn from the experience of some cultures that were perhaps more advanced than we are today in many ways.
[time=1868] And now they're having trouble." And a young lady raised her hand and she said, "Well, chief, you have to understand something. Those were a bunch of Indians, were Americans."
[time=1879] And I thought, "The arrogance, the racism in that statement. That's outrageous. That's arrogant elitism."
[time=1888] And that's what the Bible concerns us about here. He says, "Woe to a society that thinks somehow you can go over the same hurdles that other cultures have gone over and knock them down and not be concerned about them, but somehow you are better, you cannot fall as they have fallen."
[time=1905] And finally, he talks about corrupt leadership in verses 21 and 22.
[time=1909] "Woe to those who wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight." And then he goes on to say, "Woe to those who are heroes in drinking wine and valiant men and mixing strong drink, who justify the wicked for a bride."
[time=1920] Now, clearly, he's talking about leadership because they have the power to justify the wicked for a bride.
[time=1926] And we have ample examples in the last 10 years of corrupt leadership. I'm not even going to take the time to give them to you. You figure that one out.
[time=1936] We're in, first and rest, sledding. Our country's in trouble. Our beloved America is taking a downward turn.
[time=1945] I talked to a Russian general. I shared this with the men last night.
[time=1950] Who said to me, "In an amazement, and I can understand, I thought I had said something to cause an international incident because it was a formal luncheon, and he was kind of yelling at me, and he was going like this and saying words in Russian that sounded to me pretty bad.
[time=1964] He was yelling at me, you know. And then he pointed at me and shook his finger at me. And I said to my interpreter, I said, "What did I say? All apologizing? Am I causing an international incident? Did I offend the general?" He said, "No, no, no. He's just excited." I said, "Yeah, I can see that."
[time=1979] He said, "What he's trying to say is, our two cultures are passing. We are going the direction you came from. You're going the direction we came from. Then he pointed his finger at you and when he shook his finger, he says, "Don't you understand? That way that you're going doesn't work. We've tried it."
[time=1993] We are going toward the free market. You're going toward socialism. You are trying to rip God and all of his influence out of your culture. We've realized that doesn't work. We're trying to put God back in as fast as we can.
[time=2007] Why are you going the way I feel here? I couldn't answer him. That is a good question. There are rough days ahead, but there are rough days ahead.
[time=2019] But not only because of social conditions, you must be prepared to face rough days ahead because you know what? Jesus promised rough days in this world system. You say he did.
[time=2031] I thought if you came to church, if you got your life right with God, if you had God in your life, if you had a relationship with Him, everything would be fine.
[time=2040] But since that's right, but let me quote you the words of Jesus. He looked to his disciples and he said this, "In this world," and he used the word "cosmos," so he wasn't referring to the dirt of the world.
[time=2052] He was referring to the world system. He was saying, "Because of this world system and how it's been literally saturated with sin and selfishness and intolerance and racism and everything else that goes with that."
[time=2069] In this world system, he pointed at his own disciples, his own followers who were following him since early he said, "You shall have tribulation."
[time=2079] I want to say that to you today. There are only two types of people in this room. There are people who have gone through some very deep seas. You've lost a child to leukemia. Maybe in a traffic accident.
[time=2093] You've heard the doctors say those awesome words. Sorry. It was positive. You have cancer. You've lost the love of a wife, a husband. You've lost a job.
[time=2108] There's that group of people who have been through the rough times. And guess what? There's another group. The other group is those who will go through rough times.
[time=2116] You see, there's no other alternative. In this world system, Jesus said, you will face hard times. Whether it's because of a deterioration of your culture, generally speaking, or whether it's something personal that comes into your life.
[time=2129] In my case, it was kind of mixture of both. And in the last year, I've gone through some very rough seas. I've been accused on national television of things that I didn't do. And I haven't had an opportunity to clear the record.
[time=2143] I feel that there's still a lot of people out there that believe some of the lies that were told about me. I'm deeply hurt because of that.
[time=2150] I feel like I want to run up to everybody and say, let me tell you the truth. And I know I can't do that. So I just plot along in a friend of mine put it this way.
[time=2160] He said, well, the people that know you don't believe it. The people that don't know you, who cares? And I said to myself, although I didn't say it out loud, I care.
[time=2171] I care about people who don't know me, who believe this stuff. And for the first time in my life, I've really fully understood the words of Solomon where he says a good name is better than gold, ye even precious stones.
[time=2183] I know what that means now, folks. My heart is ached because of my reputation loss. And I've had to divorce a woman I love. You say, wouldn't it? You divorce Esther? No.
[time=2197] The love of my life, my wife of 38 years is closer to me than she's ever been. She's been a pillar of strength to me through all of this. We've hung on one another.
[time=2207] But I had to divorce the LAPD. And right behind my family, that was very close. My God, my wife and family in the LAPD. I love the LAPD. I love police work.
[time=2222] And it was necessary for me to leave. Some of the men know the reasons I'm not going to go into that today.
[time=2228] But in light of all this, I want to give you some hope. What are we to do when we're facing trouble times socially, breakdown socially? What are we to do when we face personal tragedies? Some of which we just discussed?
[time=2241] What is the word of God say? I want you to turn in your Bible to Psalms 37. One of my most favorite Psalms. Just an incredible Psalm. It gives so much hope in so much specific direction on what we're supposed to do.
[time=2255] Because you see, David was there. David felt a persecution unjustly. And he was angry as I have been angry. He was fretting as I have fredded.
[time=2270] He was angry because God didn't answer him and he kept on hearing the words that I have heard when I look to the book of the Bible.
[time=2277] Wait. And I'll have to tell you one time I literally shouted while looking up toward heaven. God, I'm tired of waiting. I want you to do something now.
[time=2286] And his answer was still wait. Have you ever got that kind of an answer from God? I have. I didn't like it.
[time=2295] I sin. I got mad at God. That's sin. I've confessed it. I've treated it like any other sin. But let's look at what God said to David.
[time=2304] He says, "Fret not yourself because of evil doers." He knew David was fretting. He was looking at evil guys. And they seem to be getting ahead. And he trying to follow God was in trouble.
[time=2314] I felt like that. I could really identify with David. Fret not yourself of evil doers. Be not envious toward wrong doers. For they will wither quickly like the grass and fade like the green herb. And then he gives him four principles, the first one in verse three.
[time=2327] Number one, he's got the context again now in the times of stress, intribulation. Number one, trust in the Lord and do good, dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.
[time=2337] Let's pick out the first word there. Trust in the Lord. Now for some reason, in times of trial, the human thing to do is say, "God, if this is all you're going to do for me, if you're not helping me now, if you're not going to do something, if you're going to allow me to go through this, I'm going to give up on this."
[time=2353] I'm giving up on you. I'm not even sure you're there. You're not answering my prayers like I want you to answer him. I'm hanging it up.
[time=2363] In 1989 and 90, I took two trips down the Colorado River. The first one, I'm not going to go into the details, but I had an accident in the rafting.
[time=2371] There's over 100 rapids as you go through the Grand Canyon. And I broke three ribs. And those three ribs were pushed into my lung and ripped the big hole in this left lung and this left lung collapsed.
[time=2381] And I remember laying on that beach and thinking at that point, nearly 35 years of law enforcement, gun battles and all that, and I'm going to die in a Colorado River in a rafting accident.
[time=2391] Well, I didn't die. And I went back the following year because I figured it's like a bucking horse. You can't buck you off. You've got to get back right on.
[time=2400] So I told my wife, "I'm going back next year. I'm going to make it all the way this time. I'm going to make all eight days." She said, "You're not going without Bobby. Bobby's our son." And then when she called Bob over, she said, "I want you to bodyguide your dad. Don't let him do anything dumb like it did last year."
[time=2414] So we went down together. And there's over 100 rapids in those eight days.
[time=2423] And the worst one usually is lava falls. They call it lava falls because it's more than a rapid. It's falls. You drop down 37 vertical feet in 75 horizontal feet. You can figure it out.
[time=2434] In that big rush of the Colorado River, the huge river it is, the violent river it is. That is a massive drop of 37 feet and 75 feet.
[time=2442] Your raff literally is inundated. It disappears. It goes under the water. You pop up. You don't know where you're at. You go under again. You take another breath. It's incredible.
[time=2450] But for some reason this year, the serious rapid was Kermit. They adjust the level of the water somehow at Parker Dam and for some reason, because of the rocks in this particular rapid, Kermit was the most violent.
[time=2466] And as we approach Kermit, we had this raff master Robin and we soon learned that he had a euphemism that he learned to describe the rough rapids.
[time=2474] When we were approaching some rough ones, he would say, "This is going to bear a good one." And we all knew that meant, "We're all going to die."
[time=2485] Well, as we approach Kermit and he was assessing the level of the water and all that, he said, "This is going to be a real good one."
[time=2495] Great Scott. And so Bob said, "Dad, hold on. Get a grip for our part." The lashings of rope that went over the tarps that were over our sleeping bags and food.
[time=2507] I grabbed for the rope and I lay down. And as we started into it, a strange thing occurred. Robin turned the rough sideways.
[time=2517] And we heard the roar. We saw the mist. We knew it was going to be a terrible experience and we're going into it sideways.
[time=2525] I had been talking to Robin. He had mentioned a few problems he had personally. They didn't seem to be that bad. I didn't think he was at it.
[time=2531] But I thought, "Great Scott. He's going to commit suicide and he's taking all of his weapons." And my initial reaction just for a second was, "Get out of the raff. Jump." And of course, I really would have been killed if I'd done that. Fortunately, I stayed under raft. And then as we went over the brink and started down through the rapids,
[time=2548] a new boulder, when I say new, within the last year or two, because it wasn't smooth yet with the water, still jagged, was right in the center of the rapids.
[time=2558] Sticking up, a huge old thing. Would have flipped the raft over if we'd had hit it in fact a week prior, some people had lost their lives at that point.
[time=2566] Robin had turned the raft sideways for a reason. He had his weapon of redemption on the back, turned all the way up, and he pushed us around that jagged rock.
[time=2575] He knew exactly what he was doing.
[time=2578] I hope you see the illustration.
[time=2583] In the middle of my problems, sometimes I think, "God, why are you turning the raft sideways? We're going to be killed."
[time=2594] My reputation's gone, "God, you know what you're doing?" And I'm tempted to jump from the raft.
[time=2601] That's why God told David in the middle of trial, "That's a trying to trust even more. You need me more now than you did when things are going good."
[time=2610] There's a rock in the stream ahead, "Man, I've got to get you around it. Don't you understand? You need me more now than ever."
[time=2618] America needs God today more than it ever did. Word of time of crisis. And I want to call your attention to something I've told the men all this week.
[time=2627] America is not a piece of dirt. It's not a constitution. You know what America is. You and me.
[time=2632] If America is going to have a turn around, you and I are going to have to have a turn around.
[time=2637] The point is trust in the Lord. Stay on the raft. Stay close to Him.
[time=2648] Number two, delight in the Lord. I want you to see a word picture here.
[time=2652] When I started thinking about my emotions, I stepped down. I want you to just envision right here a pool of quicksand.
[time=2660] And when I would step into that pool of quicksand, which was my emotions, and think about all that was happening, I would begin to sink. I would begin to be very depressed.
[time=2669] I would get down right despondent. I had trouble sleeping. But when I looked back here and said, "There is a rock."
[time=2680] You know, I don't think it's by happenstance that in the Bible, the Lord is referred to as the rock, the cornerstone.
[time=2686] When I would climb back on that rock, realizing, "Wait a minute. I know who God is. Those situations are bad news. I realize that."
[time=2693] But my God is the God of the universe. He's omnipotent. He can do anything He wants. He's omniscient. He knows everything.
[time=2702] He loves me so much. The Bible says, "While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us on the cross." You know, that's the real message of the gospel.
[time=2708] God became a man, lived the perfect life, died on the cross of substitutionary death for our sins, our imperfections.
[time=2716] And I want you to notice something as you look at that portion of the verse. It says, "Delight in the Lord."
[time=2724] A lot of people misunderstand it. They go around telling one another. When something happens, when you lose a loved one, just flank the Lord.
[time=2731] Well, I'm sure they mean well, but right here, what the Bible is saying, "No, you're not supposed to thank the Lord." When someone says, "Hey, buddy, you've got cancer. Thank you, Lord, I've got cancer."
[time=2740] But he says, "Delight in me when you're told you've got cancer." You've just lost a loved one. God doesn't expect you to like that.
[time=2749] But he expects you to delight in him, in fact, at a time like that, is a time when you most need to recognize who he is.
[time=2756] And I found when I got out of that pit of quickset of my emotion and poor Vernon, look what's happening to him, and I got back up on who is God.
[time=2765] God's a creator of the universe. God loves me. God has a plan for me. He's got the raft sideways for a reason.
[time=2773] This is God we're talking about, not man that makes mistakes. You know what? My spirits would boy up. I would suddenly say, "That's right!"
[time=2781] And I would begin delighting, not in the circumstance, but in God. And then the third principle, commit your way to the Lord.
[time=2791] Trust also in him, and he will do it. Commit. I looked up that word, interesting background. It came from a root meaning in Hebrew to roll.
[time=2800] That didn't make sense to me, so I had to do some further reading. I found out that it came from the concept of rolling a log down a hill.
[time=2808] And let me tell you something. When they cut down one of those logs, and if you've ever been over to Israel, around Palestine, there are a lot of hills.
[time=2815] In fact, Jerusalem is on a hill. Pretty big hill. There are trees there now. You can see a lot of trees, just as you approach Jerusalem.
[time=2823] And if you're on the side of a hill, and you cut down a tree, and then you start that log rolling, you know what? You're committed.
[time=2829] There's no stopping that log once it gets rolling. That's the concept here. That you take an action that you cannot recall. That's what commit means.
[time=2842] He says, "Commit your way to the Lord." Don't keep on taking it back. Commit it to him.
[time=2850] Roll the log. Take that step of action that cannot be recalled. God, I'm in the middle of some problems here. I can't handle it. I'm committing this to you know, sometimes I think it's helpful to visualize.
[time=2865] I kind of visualize putting all of my problems in a kind of a sack, and putting it over my shoulder, and walking into the throne room where God is, you know?
[time=2876] And covered by the perfection of Jesus, because I have no right to be in God's presence. I'm a sinner except I'm in Jesus. And so I just kind of like Jesus is a sheet over me hiding me, you know?
[time=2886] It's his perfection. I walk into God's throne room, and I got all these problems, and I kind of like to visualize taking that sack off, and just throwing it in front, and then getting away from it, and leaving it there.
[time=2895] Kind of like rolling that log. Committing it to him. And leaving it there. My problem is, I find myself rushing back in and starting to pick it up again.
[time=2905] He says, no, no, no. Roll it. Commit your way to the Lord. Take that step that can't be recalled. I like that. Then the final principle. Rest in the Lord, wait patiently for him.
[time=2921] Fret not yourself because of him who prospers. Seize from anger. Forsake wrath. You know, it's so easy to get mad when things are not going your way. Even at God, I've already confessed to you. I found myself doing that. That was wrong.
[time=2936] Getting mad at the person involved, perhaps, even when they have done you wrong, it says, forsake wrath. That doesn't do any good. That's just bad for you. Make yourself sick if you let it go too long.
[time=2946] Don't let the Son go down in your wrath. Says another portion of the Bible. Forsake wrath. Rest in the Lord. If our God is who we believe he is and he is, you don't have to continue to get angry.
[time=2959] Who that dirty guy, he did me wrong. I'm going to get him. Don't get mad. Just get even some people say. That's not what the Bible says.
[time=2970] Seize from anger. Forsake wrath. Rest in the Lord. You know, the Lord uses things in our life for very many reasons. I want to focus our attention as we close just on one verse.
[time=2992] If you turn in your Bibles to Isaiah, the 30th chapter, there's a remarkable verse that talks about one of the reasons. It's not the only reason, but one of the reasons that God allows things to come into our lives.
[time=3006] Charles Stanley, as you're turning in, I want to give you a quote from Charles Stanley. Charles Stanley has a great quote. He says, "Some things are so important to God that they are worth interrupting the happiness and health of his children in order to accomplish them."
[time=3021] I like that and I think this is one of those. Isaiah 30 and we'll begin reading with verse 16.
[time=3034] Hope I got the right verse here. It's 18.
[time=3038] Therefore, the Lord longs to be gracious to you and therefore he waits on high to have compassion on you. For the Lord is a God of justice. How blessed are those who long for him?
[time=3047] Old people of Zion, inhabit, inhabit in Jerusalem. You will weep no longer. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry.
[time=3059] When he hears it, he will answer you. Now look at verse 20. This is important. Although the Lord has given you the bread of privation and the water of oppression, tribulation hard times, he or teacher will no longer hide himself, but your eyes will behold your teacher and your ears will hear a word behind you.
[time=3076] This is the way. Walk in it. Whatever you turn to the right or left and you see what he's getting at here is sometimes it takes God allowing something to come into our life to kind of get our attention so we'll listen to him.
[time=3091] I want to close this morning by telling you the true story of a friend of mine, a friend of your pastor Russ's. His name is Lynn Crowley.
[time=3100] Lynn Crowley is a remarkable man. He has everything going for him. Good looks, brilliant, athletic. One of those guys has everything going for him.
[time=3110] He lived three doors down for me. His father was a mayor of Pasadena where I live in the city I live. He has a younger brother Phil. Phil came to know the Lord of the young life camp.
[time=3119] I disciple Phil for a few years brought him along in a faith. We began praying for his brother Lynn, but his brother Lynn had so many things going for him. Everything was happening so good for him. He didn't need God.
[time=3131] And here we see an illustration of this verse that I just read to you from Isaiah where sometimes God has to put something in our life and don't order to give our attention.
[time=3139] So he can listen so so rather we can listen as his still small voice says this is the way turn to the right here turn to the left here. We seem to listen to God more when the midst of trial.
[time=3149] Sometimes that's the reason for it. And Lynn Crowley within a few years suffered four major in not four years within just a few months really suffered four major impacts in his life.
[time=3161] He lost his brother Alex his older brother that he dearly almost idolized who was at Harvard Law School and was killed in a tragic accident.
[time=3172] His career in professional football was wiped out by a knee injury free agent with the Kansas City Chiefs.
[time=3181] He then went to Minneapolis Minnesota started a business a few months later the business was belly up to his bankrupt. And to top it off the girl he was intending to marry who had been dating for several years left him for what he thought was his best friend.
[time=3194] All of those things happened within a period of time. Have you seen those scales when this happens at 30 points when this happens another 20 points and when this happens and when you get 100 you're dead he had about 120 points.
[time=3204] And a few months later Lynn Crowley found himself in Chicago. A guy had given him a track in in Minneapolis he had heard a brief explanation of the gospel the guy had talked to him on the phone he was kind of an eccentric guy said look all you have to do is confess to God your center and pray and and he'll come in are you willing to do that and let Lynn said well yeah.
[time=3224] He was just trying to start getting interested the guy said okay man great see in heaven click him up on him kind of unusual but a couple months later Lynn found himself in in Chicago being trained in a seminar and how to raise money for Harvey mud because those are the people that hired him for this new job and he couldn't sleep and he was up in the morning he was still seeking God he had so many problems he had turned to God in his desperation and he found an open chapel and he walked in that open chapel and just prior to going into the open chapel he had bought an out of town.
[time=3253] He bought an out of town newspaper from he wanted to get the newspaper from Topeka Kansas where this guy that stole his girlfriend was writing a sports column he couldn't get one from Topeka the guy at the out of town newspaper rack says here I got phone from Kansas City Kansas that close enough he said well they may cover to yeah give it to me he took it and folded put it in his arm went into this chapel the chapel was empty went down to the platform God down in his knees in his in his effort to seek God begin to cry out to God eventually God please help me God if you're there I don't know if you're there but if you're there.
[time=3282] God I need you if that guy that said something to me on the phone if that made any sense I don't know it's kind of sounded bizarre but if it's true God I want you God I need you God and then he was overcome with emotion he began to weep
[time=3296] Lynn Crowley the strong man the handsome man the athlete the guy that had everything going for him was crushed and broken he found himself actually laying on his face
[time=3303] there weeping his heart out and saying God please help me heal me I need you God he said I did that for 45 minutes no one came in he got up got to control
[time=3315] himself walk back to his hotel walked into the place where they serve breakfast they had opened by that time he said down he got a
[time=3323] menu he ordered a short stack and some orange juice as the waitress walked away he opened the newspaper from Kansas City
[time=3330] Kansas and there in the front page in a little box it said Bible verse for the day and he read it and it said behold I have seen your tears I have heard your prayers I will heal you
[time=3351] and then Crowley began crying all over again when then Crowley came back to Pasadena I began running with him every morning I
[time=3363] disciples him two years later he told me he was being called to the ministry he worked with Russ at grace church he now
[time=3371] he now as a pastor of the Highland Park Baptist Church at great church north of Detroit with a president of moody Bible Institute was a pastor
[time=3382] Lynn Crowley the broken man is now Lynn Crowley the strong man of God because he reached out to God at a time of trouble and trial and God was there
