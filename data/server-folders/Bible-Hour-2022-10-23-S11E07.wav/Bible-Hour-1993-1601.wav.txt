[time=0] And I often wondered and wished secretly in my heart and thought to myself, "What would
[time=17] happen if Christ would just show up in his home when I was there maybe?"
[time=23] And Jesus would say to kids, "See, I'm real and you can touch me." And then maybe Jesus would do a miracle or two, right in front of his eyes.
[time=36] And I wondered, "Boy, would that be enough to cause my beloved grandfather to repent?"
[time=56] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=63] Thank you for joining us.
[time=66] Why do some people refuse to accept Christ?
[time=69] It seems with some that, no matter how clearly the gospel is presented, they just won't repent and come to Christ.
[time=75] Maybe you have a loved one or a dear friend like that.
[time=78] You know they know the truth about Christ, but they simply refuse to turn their life over to Him.
[time=85] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore leads us in an exciting study of the Unrepentant.
[time=91] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the Book of Revelations, Chapters 8 and 9.
[time=98] Our special music today will be provided by Kevin Rowe and Denise Mitchell.
[time=104] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=133] We are the Holy God.
[time=185] We worship you of mighty God in you.
[time=208] We worship you of the Holy God.
[time=237] We worship you of mighty God in you.
[time=246] We worship you of the Holy God.
[time=352] I'm so thankful that you joined us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=372] I just want to remind you that if you're watching the Bible Hour in Fort Wayne, tonight is a special program right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=380] We're going to have the musical presentation "Good Kings Come in Small Packages." This is a musical presented by our King's Kids Choir, grades 1, 2 and 3, joining together.
[time=392] They've been preparing for a long time.
[time=394] If you want to see something that's really inspiring, seeing these children act and sing, and just understand some biblical principles about what it means to be a good king and a bad king,
[time=405] come tonight to Black Hawk Baptist Church here at 7,400 East State in Fort Wayne at 6 p.m.
[time=412] and see the musical "Good Kings Come in Small Packages." And then for the last couple of weeks, we've been offering to you a book called "L.A. Justice" by the former Assistant Police Chief of the L.A. Police Department.
[time=427] That's right, Pete.
[time=428] And I just want to say what a tremendous time God gave us with Bob Vernon, and I know that many of you were aware of his coming
[time=435] and joined us in praying that God would use him and his ministry here.
[time=439] And it's been phenomenal to see the number of people who have prayed to receive Christ at some of the CBMC breakfasts and lunch,
[time=447] and then of course he met with area law enforcement men, and it was greatly used of God in that form.
[time=452] And then as you know, Pete, you were a part of that. He was just powerful at our men's retreat.
[time=459] We had over 200 men there, so we're excited about that.
[time=462] And this book, "L.A. Justice" gives you an inside look at what actually happened in the Rodney King incident and then the subsequent riot.
[time=472] And a lot of times I'm suspect of the press and the way they choose to present different issues.
[time=478] And for once, there's here's a man, and I can trust and I believe his faith in Christ is strong, and he was in the middle of it all.
[time=485] And so it's a great firsthand look of what actually happened in that whole situation.
[time=489] Well, I want to echo your sentiments that I was inspired by him being here.
[time=494] Often we expect, I guess, what we call pastors to be really out there in the workplace representing Jesus Christ.
[time=502] But here's a man that dedicated some 37 years to law enforcement in a major U.S. city that really has an unblemished record as it relates to representing the Lord Jesus Christ while serving his city.
[time=517] And so that was a great time with him.
[time=520] And perhaps there are some of you that would like to receive the book and read what Mr. Vernon has to say about this issue.
[time=528] And not only that issue, but what he feels about the family and the deterioration of the family.
[time=534] And some of the solutions presented through God's Word that he uses in his book LA Justice.
[time=541] While you can write for that booklet today, that actually book, and by writing to the Bible Hour, at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=554] Again, write to the Bible Hour, just ask for the book LA Justice.
[time=558] The address is 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=566] We'd like to suggest to you that you send a donation of $15 or more to help defer the cost of providing this book.
[time=574] And then we want to plan ahead and have you put on the calendar a special date.
[time=580] Russell, the other day, I was playing golf, and I played golf with the former mayor of Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=588] And we were talking about, in fact, he brought up, when is the patriotic panorama?
[time=593] He has come every year for a number of years, and we wanted to tell folks that that is coming up on June 27th.
[time=602] The annual patriotic panorama here at Black Hawk Baptist Church, we're entitling it, "reflections on America from sea to shining sea."
[time=611] It'll be a chance to sing music and to give honor to those that have served in our country's armed services, time to clap your hands and to be thankful for America and be thankful for our God.
[time=626] That's allowed us such freedoms in America. You know, Russell, we are really fortunate as a country to be as free as we are with our freedom of worship.
[time=635] Well, I think that has been of all the resources given to us in this country, the greatest, to be able to freely worship our God and to serve Him.
[time=644] I know even the Bible hour being able to be broadcast on television.
[time=648] A lot of countries that would be censored and shut down and here we have an opportunity. And just the other day, Pete, we were talking about a family who had watched us on the Bible hour for a couple of times.
[time=659] They've been looking for a church and they came and experienced our church and saw there's a whole lot more to us than the Bible hour, all the ministry for kids and ladies, Bible studies and all the rest.
[time=670] And they just joined the church after spending about six months with us. So it's just a privilege of proclaiming your faith in a country that permits that.
[time=679] Perhaps you've watched the Bible hour and you've never come to join us. Come on a Sunday morning or for one of our special events as we announce them, we'd love to see you in person.
[time=689] We're going back now to the live portion of our service for more music and then the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=700] [MUSIC]
[time=730] Somebody here has a broken heart. Somebody's gonna cry when they're all alone.
[time=747] Somebody here just does not quite yet understand that Jesus died to bear every single care that we have.
[time=765] There's no heartache, there's no pain that he cannot feel.
[time=777] Not a wound, it's a pain that he cannot hear. No burden to break to bear, or Lord he won't share.
[time=791] 'Cause in our weakness he's a friend indeed.
[time=811] Somebody here has a question now wondering if others ever hurt this way.
[time=825] Somebody's dying just to know that Jesus hears every single care and he will never leave you alone.
[time=843] There's no heartache, there's no pain that he cannot feel.
[time=854] Not a wound, it's a pain that he cannot hear. No burden to break to bear, or Lord he won't share.
[time=868] 'Cause in our weakness he's a friend indeed.
[time=877] He sees and hears he knows my Jesus knows every heartache we endure.
[time=895] I know that Jesus is the cure. There's no heartache, there's no pain that he cannot feel.
[time=920] Not a wound, it's a fear that he cannot hear. No burden to break to bear, or Lord he won't share.
[time=934] 'Cause in our weakness he's a friend indeed. No heartache, there's no pain that he cannot feel.
[time=949] Not a wound, it's a fear that he cannot hear. No burden to break to bear, or Lord he won't share.
[time=963] 'Cause in our weakness he's a friend indeed.
[time=990] Amen. Thank you, Kevin and Denise, for singing so beautifully about our high priest who can make intercession for us,
[time=1000] because he took the form of human flesh and felt all the pain and sorrow in the heart of life.
[time=1006] Well, if you have your Bibles with you this morning, I'll invite you to take them and come to Revelation 9.
[time=1013] We come in the portion of our service where we open the Word of God and study it and look to apply it to our lives and worship God through the study and the careful examination of his Word.
[time=1027] And we're in a series or really a book study of the book of Revelation and we come to chapters 8 and 9 this morning, but we're gonna go to the end of those two chapters, because they're driving us in that direction and read verses 20 and 21 and then back up and get a context for it.
[time=1045] Revelation 9, verse 20.
[time=1048] And the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, so as not to worship demons and the idols of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk.
[time=1066] And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their immorality, nor of their thefts.
[time=1077] This is a remarkable statement or series of statements about people's unwillingness to repent.
[time=1085] The word repent means to change your mind, it means to change your mind about something to have formerly viewed it this way, then you repent now, you view it the other way.
[time=1095] And these people are refusing to change their mind about their religious beliefs, their idolatry, their worshiping gold and silver.
[time=1103] And they're also unwilling to change their minds about their deeds, their murdering, their sorcery, their immorality, and their thievery.
[time=1113] One of the most painful memories in my life to date is standing there at the grave of my grandfather, Russell B. Seymour.
[time=1123] And our family was gathered there, and I was presiding, and it was just a small family gathering, and our family was in unity, the pain didn't come from my family.
[time=1132] The pain came from the very realization that our grandfather, we call him Kid, that was kind of our grandfather name for him, that Kid had all of his life refused to repent and come to Christ.
[time=1146] And there would have been times before I was even born that my parents would have shared the gospel with Kid, and later my sisters, as they grew up before me, my older sisters.
[time=1157] And finally, when I came to Christ at about the age of 20, named after him, Russell Moore, Russell B. Seymour, his own namesake, I would sit with him, a seminary student, living with them at the time.
[time=1168] Great level of respect for my grandfather, he was a federal judge, and often we would hear reports of his honesty and integrity in the courtroom, he was a moral man.
[time=1179] But for that brief window of time when the grandchild and the grandfather are both adults, I had the privilege of sharing the gospel time and time again, and trying to answer questions that he had about the scriptures.
[time=1193] But in the end he continued in his agnosticism, he just didn't know, he wasn't there, and he can't believe in things, he wasn't there to see, and all that went with that.
[time=1205] And I remember at different points in my relationship with him, wondering, and really wishing, what would happen if Christ himself would show up in this room where we were talking about the gospel?
[time=1218] And if Christ would say, "See here, my nail pierced hands and my feet, and here's where the sword got me, and I'm the living Lord, and to prove it for you, kid, I'll do a few miracles."
[time=1230] And maybe he would have performed just a few, just a smattering of miracles right in front of my grandfather's own eyes, and I often would wonder, "Would that be enough to bring repentance?"
[time=1242] If he had just seen the living Christ and watched the miracles, would that have been enough?
[time=1249] And I don't believe it would have been, and I base that belief on other passages in Scripture, not the least of which chapters 8 and 9 from the book of Revelation.
[time=1260] And what I think you'll see this morning is that people choose not to repent, not because a lack of information, not for lack of proof, not for lack of solid information about Christ,
[time=1271] and about heaven, and about hell. People choose to repent for a different reason, which I'll share at the end of this message.
[time=1278] But let's back up and come to Revelation chapter 8 and get an overview of these two chapters, and we're going to try to cover two chapters this morning in about 40 minutes time, and so we'll move rather rapidly, and just try to take the high points from these passages.
[time=1292] It begins chapter 8 verses 1 and 2, and when he broke the seven seals, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
[time=1303] Now some have used this verse to prove there will be no women in heaven. It's a joke, I'm sorry. We'll go on.
[time=1313] Of course, we know that men talk more than women, if you don't think so, ask my wife. Verse 1 again, and when he broke the seven seals, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
[time=1324] And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. Now this silence is really something. You've got the whole multitude of heaven there.
[time=1335] You've got myriads and myriads and myriads and myriads of angels. You've got the whole redeemed church because they've been raptured, represented by the 24 elders, and it's a loud place.
[time=1344] Do you remember our study so far? In chapter 4 verse 1, there was a voice which sounded like a trumpet speaking in heaven.
[time=1352] Around the throne of God, there were peels of thunder. We had some of that last night. That's very noisy.
[time=1358] In chapter 5, there was a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice asking this question who was worthy to open the book.
[time=1366] We found also in chapter 5 that they were singing a new song. This redeemed church was singing a new song, and making all the noise that that would represent.
[time=1377] And then myriads and myriads and thousands of thousands of angels were saying with a loud voice, worthy is the Lamb.
[time=1385] Today, heaven has been full of noise, and God apparently likes it loud when people are worshipping, and they're doing that, and there's a huge innumerable host of people doing all of this worshipping.
[time=1395] But suddenly, with the opening of the seventh seal, the whole thing goes dead silent. And for a long time.
[time=1410] That was pretty long, for me to stand here and be quiet. Imagine it for 30 minutes. A whole multitude of folks, angels and redeemed folks just absolutely silent, not a pin drop, nothing for a half an hour.
[time=1423] We don't know exactly why, but it seems as if they understand what's coming with the seventh seal. The seventh seal brings forth seven trumpets.
[time=1432] It opens up a whole new series of judgments, and these judgments come faster in their pace. This is near the end of the tribulation, and they're going to happen now rapid fire, and they're even more intense than the first six seals that we've looked at.
[time=1448] The devastation and the destruction is more intense than what has already come, and so maybe they're just silent. They're almost stunned in the silent set. What did they have read as the seventh seal is opened?
[time=1459] Now, the scroll is fully open, and they can peruse the whole lot of it.
[time=1466] Today, we have found in the six seals the first that false world peace which gave way to worldwide war, which gave way to worldwide famine, which gave way to worldwide pestilence, and then the fifth seal, the prayer of the saints for vengeance from God.
[time=1482] And then in the sixth seal, not an earthquake, not an earth shaking, but a universe shaking, and all of the universe was shaken by the power of God.
[time=1491] And the sun went to black, and the moon went to blood, and the stars, our parts of stars fell from the heavens and crashed into the earth, and the sky, it said, split apart like a scroll.
[time=1503] I mean, just the horizon, just split and disappeared, and the islands and mountains, probably entire continents were beginning to move, so mighty were the earthquakes that followed.
[time=1515] And that's tough, and that's bad, and that's horrible, but silence indicates here that what's coming is even worse in these six trumpet judgments, and I just want to skip across the top of them with you this morning, and then draw some application from them.
[time=1530] And the first of these trumpet judgments is in verse seven.
[time=1534] And the first sounded, and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth, and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
[time=1551] This is an absolutely devastating picture. Wood that all of us depend upon for construction, those of you who are in that endeavor, would suddenly find your product increasingly more valuable, or if you happen to own the forests that were destroyed, you're instantly out of business.
[time=1566] A loss of animals, the cropped destruction, the globe is scorched by this fire mixed with blood that's thrown from heaven.
[time=1574] And then the second angel sounds in verse eight, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood, and a third of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life they died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
[time=1592] Probably a part of a great star comes crashing through the earth's atmosphere and crashes into one of the oceans, and it turns the ocean into blood.
[time=1602] And so that kills all the fish, a third of the fish, and they no doubt float to the top, and now we've got a worldwide pollution problem that we don't know what to do with.
[time=1612] And when this huge mountain crashes into the ocean, it says a third of the ships are destroyed, probably because of a great tidal wave that it created, and it just destroys all these ships, and everybody who's in it.
[time=1624] Verse 10, a third angel sounded, his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell in a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters, and that's a little bit more difficult to envision.
[time=1638] And how does one star kind of spread out and land in all the springs and the fresh water sources, and maybe because of its composition, when it hit the earth's atmosphere, it kind of explodes, and begins to rain itself down.
[time=1653] Verse 11, the name of the star is Wormwood, which is an ancient title for poison, a very bitter poison, and a third of the waters become poisoned, Wormwood, and many men die from the waters because they were made bitter.
[time=1667] They got to drink something, and they drink it, and they die.
[time=1672] And then a fourth trumpet is sounded, verse 12, and the fourth angel sounded, and a third of the sun, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were smitten, so that a third of them might be darkened, and the day might not shine for a third of it, and night in the same way.
[time=1689] And now, unbelievable things begin to happen, because it's involving the heavens themselves, the whole structure of the weather system now begins to fall apart, and everything that's controlled by the moon and the tides, and everything becomes unpredictable, and everything is uncertain.
[time=1708] So these people, if you'll follow the flow of these trumpets, first the land, a third of the land is destroyed, then a third of the sea is destroyed, then a third of the fresh water source is destroyed, and then a third of the heavens are destroyed.
[time=1722] A radical drop in temperature all over the earth, violent storms, weather changes, a total interruption of the botanical and biological cycles.
[time=1733] And you can bet that people all over the world are scurrying together for news conferences, and seminars, and summits, and papers, and meetings, and all the brilliance of the world is coming together to try to figure out what in the world are we going to do?
[time=1749] Now that everything we've always counted on is falling apart, and you don't need to turn there, but the Lord says in Luke 21 verses 25 and 26 about this very period of history, He says this.
[time=1760] And there will be signs in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth dismay among nations.
[time=1768] Absolute dismay.
[time=1770] In perplexity, at the roaring of the sea and the waves, they won't have any idea what to do.
[time=1778] They'll be gathering and plotting and scheming, but the problems will be of a far greater magnitude than they've ever experienced before, and their resources to combat the problems will be insufficient.
[time=1789] And they'll just be in dismay, and they'll be perplexed.
[time=1792] In fact, it goes on, he says, men will be fainting from fear, and the expectation of the things which are coming upon the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
[time=1803] People will just be fainting.
[time=1806] They'll just be so overcome with the fear and the terror of the uncertainty of the heavens themselves being shaken, and everything they've counted on in the past being repetitive and constant and steady.
[time=1817] None of that is true anymore, and they just are overwhelmed with fear and they faint.
[time=1823] It's a horrible scene, but look at chapter 8, verse 13.
[time=1829] There's an eagle flying around in mid-Heaven, and he's saying with a loud voice, Revelation 8, 13.
[time=1837] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! To those who dwell on the earth, because of the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound.
[time=1849] In other words, in the vernacular of the day, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[time=1853] We just get started here. These four trumpets affect kind of the natural laws of nature, but what you're going to see in the next two trumpets,
[time=1862] the demonic force gets involved. Hell itself is unleashed on earth.
[time=1868] And so the eagle says, "Man, whoa! Hang on to your seats."
[time=1874] Well, let's look at it. The fifth trumpet, chapter 9, verse 1, and the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from heaven which had fallen to the earth, and the key of the bottomless pit was given to him.
[time=1884] This is obviously a different kind of star. This is not a star that falls out of the universe. This is a star with personality. It's called a hymn.
[time=1892] And as you know, the angels are often called stars. The morning stars are saying at the dawn of creation. The angels are saying, as God created the heavens and the earth, the book of Job tells us.
[time=1902] This is a demon. This is a personality demon. This is a star that has personality, and it's given a key, and it takes that key, and it opens what is referred to here as the bottomless pit.
[time=1915] And look at verse 2, when that happens, smoke comes up out of the pit. Like the smoke of a great furnace. It would bring to our mind the erupting of a great volcano, but beyond anything we've ever seen or dreamed of before.
[time=1928] So bad that the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. Verse 3, "Out of the smoke came forth locus upon the earth, and power was given them as the scorpions of the earth have power."
[time=1940] And they were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but only the men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
[time=1949] And apparently the believers living in this time have a seal on their forehead, not the mark of the beast, a seal put there by God that protects them from this demonic host that is being belched out of the bottomless pit.
[time=1962] Verse 5, "And they were not permitted to kill anyone, but to torment for five months, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings a man."
[time=1974] Now this bottomless pit is, the Greek word there is "tartarus," and it occurs in other places in the New Testament. It's a holding pit. It's a demonic prison is what it is.
[time=1984] And since the creation, God has sovereignly taken demons that got out of line, and they're all out of line, but out of line with respect to His parameters, and He has thrown them in this pit.
[time=1995] And you remember Jesus confronting the Moniac, and the demons inside said, "Have you come to torment us before our time?" And they besieged that He not threw them there in the pit, and He put them in the swine, and they jumped over the hill into the ocean.
[time=2009] This is a demon prison, this bottomless pit, and I don't have time, I could, but I don't have time to develop that whole theme for you this morning.
[time=2016] But what is happening is there's a demon up in the heavens, and He receives a key to this demon prison, and He unlocks it, and it belches out an innumerable number of demons that have been incarcerated there for who knows how long, thousands of years.
[time=2033] And they come out like locusts, and here you have some wonderful imagery, and if you don't think about locust plagues, the most recent one was 1951, 1952 in the Middle East, and they descended on the Middle East like a big black cloud.
[time=2053] And they just darkened the sky, and they chewed up an ate in rapid time, everything that was green or growing, and they left absolute desolation.
[time=2063] And so He draws upon the imagery of locust plagues, which have plagued mankind for centuries, to describe the number and the kind and the all-encompassing devouring of humanity as they are tortured and tormented by these demons.
[time=2080] They carry with them the sting of a scorpion, so He kind of crosses over in His analogy now from the devouring concept of the locusts to the power of the sting of a scorpion, and did a little research on the sting of a scorpion.
[time=2094] And if a young child is to receive the full blast of the scorpion sting, it can kill them. And full adults, when fully inflicted by a scorpion, they fall on the ground in agony, they foam at the mouth, they grind their teeth.
[time=2109] The pain is just relentless. But this pain doesn't appear to be, the kind here doesn't appear to be physical. This is some type of spiritual scorpion.
[time=2120] These demons, like locusts, come down upon a people, and they're able to inflict spiritual pain in the soul that would be analogous to the physical pain of the scorpion to the body.
[time=2134] I guess one way to look at it would be as if we just went around to all the prisons and penitentiaries in the world today and released all the criminals.
[time=2142] In other words, we are not now confronting as the church, all the demons that are, many of them are confined, and there's going to be a day when they're all released.
[time=2150] And imagine the state of America or the world, if all the prisoners were released and let to go do whatever they wanted to do.
[time=2157] Well, that's kind of the picture here. You say, "How bad is it?" I mean, how bad are these people really hurting? Well, look at verse 6.
[time=2169] And in those days, men will seek death and will not find it, and they will long to die, but death will flee them. Now, that's a very interesting verse.
[time=2184] What that's saying is, these people are trying to kill themselves, but they can't. They're unsuccessful. They're going to take razors and knives and slit their wrists, but they're not going to bleed to death.
[time=2195] They're going to take heavy things and tie them around their necks and their legs and kind of fall over into lakes and rivers and streams and pools and the ocean in hopes of drowning themselves, but they won't drown.
[time=2207] They're going to take their guns and put them to their heads and pull their triggers and the bullet will come out, but it won't kill them. They're going to seek death, but they can't find it.
[time=2217] They're going to long to die. They're going to jump off buildings and cliffs and bridges, but they won't be crushed when they hit. They'll take poison and overdose on pills, but it won't do what it normally does.
[time=2228] They won't be able to find death. Absolute picture of hopelessness. I mean, this is despair at the bottom of the pit.
[time=2239] They have seen everything they love in their created world begin to be destroyed. They have seen all their hopes and dreams dashed as the world catastrophe is so large and so significant.
[time=2250] The significance, they have no hope of eventual repair. They just believe the world is beyond hope and there's no place for them here and the torturing pain of these demons scorpion are so bad they are literally trying to kill themselves.
[time=2267] In Victor Hugo's musical version of Les Miserables, you find it said this way, "I dreamed a dream and time gone by when hope was high in life worth living.
[time=2279] I dreamed that love would never die, I dreamed that God would be forgiving. Then I was young and unafraid and dreams were made and used and wasted.
[time=2290] There was no ransom to be paid, no song and song, no line unpasted.
[time=2296] But the locus came at night with their voices soft as thunder and they tear your hope apart as they turn your dream to shame.
[time=2306] I had a dream my life would be so different from this hell I'm living, so different from what it seems. Now life has killed the dream I dreamed.
[time=2320] That'll be their experience. There will be no hope. They'll be beside themselves.
[time=2327] They'll look at their circumstances and their life and their own spiritual pain and they'll just say I want to die.
[time=2335] But they won't be able to.
[time=2338] Verses 7 through 12 go on to give somewhat of a graphic description of these demons and how they work and we're going to go over the top of that and come to the sixth trumpet in verse 13.
[time=2352] And the sixth angel sounded.
[time=2355] And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God and one saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet,
[time=2362] it's the four angels who are bound at the Great River Euphrates. So apparently the one angel blowing the sixth trumpet has the power to release four others, verse 15,
[time=2371] and the four angels who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were released so that they might kill a third of mankind.
[time=2380] And the number of the armies of the horsemen was 200 million. I heard the number of them.
[time=2388] Now we know that in the 1970s that Chinese army was reported to number about 200 million.
[time=2394] I personally don't believe this is a human army. If it is, I believe it's demon possessed. I believe and we won't look at it in great detail, but I believe that these are just demons.
[time=2403] This is a demon army of some 200 million. I believe that the first four trumpets related to the laws of nature and they affected the sea and the land and the water and the sky.
[time=2414] And when you come to these next two you've gone into a completely different category, the category of hell, the category of the demons and they compose this 200 million.
[time=2422] It may be men I prefer to understand it as demons. The significant thing about them is that they kill one third of the earth's population.
[time=2433] We already know that in the fourth seal, a quarter of the earth's population was destroyed. So now over half the earth's population is gone. They're dead. And at most six and a half year period.
[time=2446] Now folks, what are we going to do with the bodies? I mean the carnage alone is going to be impossible and it's degeneration and it's falling apart and a disease that comes with it.
[time=2462] In verse 17, I saw in the vision the horses and those who sat on them, the riders and the breastplates, the color of fire and hystenith and of brimstone and the heads of horses are like the heads of lions and out of their mouths proceed fire and smoke and brimstone.
[time=2477] And then he says it again. And a third of mankind was killed by these plagues. What plagues? By the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which proceeded out of their mouths.
[time=2490] So we have here a point of absolute total devastation. And we come back now in verses 20 and 21, look at it. This is unbelievable. And the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues.
[time=2509] These are the folks that survived all this stuff. They did not repent of the works of their hands and then verse 21 and they did not repent of their murders.
[time=2523] By this time, think with me for a minute. These people have seen the devastation of everything they treasure. Many of their loved ones are dead.
[time=2533] The physical planet is just unexplainable. It's beyond comprehension. It's smoking. It stinks. It's horrible place to be. They want to get off it. They've seen evil unleashed like no other generation. They've seen the antichrist.
[time=2548] They've seen the working of Satan and demons like no other generation. And they've heard the gospel like no other generation.
[time=2556] They've been alive to hear the voices of the 144,000 who are protected by God and who seem to make it through all these plagues without ever being affected.
[time=2565] And I'm sure that the 144,000 carry with them copies of God's Word and when they witness they take people to the book of Revelation and they begin to go through the seals and the trumpets.
[time=2575] And these people, if there is such a thing as news at this point, if that kind of stuff is still functioning after this devastation, they would know full well that they are living right in the pages of the biblical record.
[time=2587] And the very figures they hear from the news, a third of mankind is dead or a third of the ocean has been turned to blood or a third of the fresh water.
[time=2596] I mean it's all going to line up in their minds. And they're also going to hear the testimony of the Gentile believers. Many of these are not protected and they are coming under the curses and the opening of the seals and their lives are being taken by natural cause and also by martyrdom.
[time=2615] And that's a powerful witness, folks, when somebody's standing there telling you about life in Christ and coming to forgiveness in Christ and then because they refuse to take the mark of the beast they're put to death, that leaves a little bit of an impression.
[time=2628] Beyond that, they will have had the privilege of hearing from the two greatest preachers that ever lived, save the person of Jesus Christ, these two witnesses that he'll raise up during this period of time.
[time=2638] And they'll have miraculous powers and they'll have golden tongues and they'll have the ability to just devour people who try to kill them with the breath of their mouth.
[time=2650] And beyond that, they will have heard the angel who is flying around over the heavens who's preaching the gospel.
[time=2657] There's an angel in this period of time who's flying through the heavens proclaiming down to earth the true and living knowledge of Christ.
[time=2665] So they've seen it all. They've seen the devastation of all their hopes and dreams. They're at the bottom of their pit.
[time=2671] God has struck out of them every ounce of hope for life itself. They want to die. They have seen the pages of history.
[time=2678] Of the Word of God fulfilled before their very eyes. They've heard the gospel like no other generation has heard the gospel.
[time=2685] And yet they refuse to change their mind. They refuse to change their mind. They just won't repent.
[time=2697] Of two things. In verse 20, their false religious system, the work of their hands so as not to worship demons, the idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood,
[time=2708] which can neither see or hear or walk. And that's kind of a spiritual dig. In other words, it's your gods who can't see here or walk.
[time=2717] In other words, your gods can't cope with what's going on here.
[time=2720] You keep going back to your idol asking for protection. You keep going back to your idol or your false religious system trying to make sense of all this and trying to find a shelter and try to find some comfort.
[time=2730] But he can't see, he can't hear, he can't walk. Your god has shown to be impotent. And then it says in verse 21, they also refuse to change their mind about their sin.
[time=2744] Their murdering. Their sorcery, which is in the Greek, is the word called pharma-kea, from which we get our English word pharmacy.
[time=2753] It means drugs. They will not give up their killing and their murderings and they will not give up their drugs. Their drugings, which probably means more to them than now.
[time=2765] They got to get somehow separated from reality. They got to get drunk or stoned or high on cocaine or blown out of their mind on LSD or whatever else they're using because they can't face reality.
[time=2776] And their immorality, they won't give that up. This is the word pornea. In the Greek, it's the garbage can of the New Testament for sexual immorality.
[time=2785] And it includes pornography and sexual sin and homosexuality and rape and pedophilia and child molestation and bestiality and fornication.
[time=2793] It's all right there. They won't give it up. They won't change their mind about it. And they won't change their mind about their thefts.
[time=2803] They want to continue to loot and pillage and steal and take what isn't theirs.
[time=2810] Listen to those four sins. Murder, drugs, immorality, sex, sin, and theft. Sounds a lot like today.
[time=2828] So they refuse to change your mind. Let me just, as we close, draw four points of application that I hope will bring this portion of scripture to a place of real relevance in your life.
[time=2839] Number one, let me answer that first question at the beginning of the message. Why won't people change their minds?
[time=2845] I mean, if Jesus would have come down and stood in kids living room and performed some miracles and done that whole thing, would that have been enough?
[time=2852] Well, it wasn't enough for the people who lived in Revelation 8 and 9. And I don't believe it would have been enough for my grandfather.
[time=2860] Let me read you a passage. You can write this down and look it up later. It's John chapter 3, you remember verse 16. That's the one we've all memorized for God's to love the world that He gave His only begotten Son.
[time=2870] But listen to verses 19 and 20 and you'll find the answer to the question. And this is the judgment.
[time=2877] That light is come into the world and men love darkness rather than the light for their deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, less to his deeds should be exposed.
[time=2891] The problem here folks is not information. The problem is not facts. The problem is not a clear presentation of the gospel. The problem with my grandfather, the problem with friends of yours who you love and labor to bring to Christ and you bang against your head why won't they accept Christ?
[time=2907] It isn't a lack of information. It isn't a lack of truth. It isn't a lack of light. The light has come into the world. The problem is the affection of their heart.
[time=2916] They love two things. They love darkness and they love their sin. They love their darkness and they love their sin and they're not going to give it up.
[time=2935] Point number two, we've heard a lot about David Kourish lately. He presents himself as some great biblical scholar. He says that he was in fact the Lamb of God because of his ability to interpret the symbolism of the seven seals.
[time=2958] And I just have two things to say about that. David Kourish is as close to a biblical scholar and a man of God as Kovorkian is to a good doctor. They are worlds apart.
[time=2974] Let me give you the marks of David Kourish's movement. Number one, it brings reproach upon the name of Christ. He is a false Christ and he brings reproach upon you and upon me because he names himself as a biblical scholar and says I'm going to learn something from the book of Revelation.
[time=2987] Number two, he's a murderer as we have witnessed. And number three, he's full of immorality. Now if those aren't the three hallmarks of the work of Satan, murder, immorality and reproach upon the blessed name of Christ, I don't know what is.
[time=3008] And by the way, your ability to understand the seven seals does not make you the Son of God. Remember what Revelation 13 says? Blessed is he who reads and that's the man who preaches.
[time=3021] And those who hear, those are the people who hear and obviously understand the words of the prophecy and heed the things which are written in it for the time is near.
[time=3030] The only thing you'll get by understanding the seven seals and heeding it is a blessing and the blessing is coming into relationship with Christ, not becoming Christ.
[time=3042] Number three, it's been Earth Week this week. I find it interesting that it's Earth Week in America, the very Sunday we come to the absolute devastation of the Earth in our study of Revelation 8 and 9.
[time=3056] And I know there are some very good people in the Earth movement and we as America need to answer for our raping of the environment for materialistic purposes.
[time=3065] There's probably some truth in that. But there is a whole bunch of people inside the Earth Week or Earth Day movement who are after this because they love the Earth and they want to worship the Earth and the Earth is their God and they are classic Romans 1 people who reject the true creator and worship the creation.
[time=3084] And what I find so interesting about this is that the very heavens and the Earth which for millennia have declared the glory of God and shown forth his handy work to all who would look.
[time=3096] It screams to them of his invisible attributes that very heaven and that very Earth will one day not declare his glory and his handy work but will declare his wrath and he'll use the very elements of nature to come crushing down on the very people who worship nature itself.
[time=3112] What they worship will eventually kill them and take their life.
[time=3121] And this fourth point and maybe the most important point of application for us.
[time=3127] This is a missionary mandate, folks.
[time=3132] You and I believe this, right? We look at this. We don't have questions about this. We believe this is coming. There's no doubt in our minds that this is coming.
[time=3141] And it's our belief in the veracity of Scripture and the truth of Scripture that calls us and impels us and compels us to tell others about Christ because short of a relationship with Christ they're going to experience this.
[time=3153] Either on Earth or in hell itself.
[time=3157] Vance Hebner, a great famous Southern preacher said it this way. The real test of how much we believe of prophetic truth is what we are doing to warn men of the wrath to come.
[time=3170] To believe the solemn truths of prophecy and then make our way complacently through a world of sin and shame is not merely unfortunate. It's criminal.
[time=3180] And as you and I have a glimpse into the future and we're certain that it's coming and others don't. There's a whole bunch of people around us who don't know this, who've never read this, who wouldn't believe it if they did read it.
[time=3192] And our knowledge compels us to be graciously, consistently telling them about Christ, to spare them from the wrath to come.
[time=3205] It was this morning with her, a note that was written by a young African Christian not too long ago before he died for the cause of Christ.
[time=3215] And what we see behind the scenes in Revelation 8 and 9 is a whole bunch of believers who are not protected from these trials and trumpets except for the demonic ones and who are standing bold and strong for their faith.
[time=3232] Among African seems to capture the spirit of their heart. This note was found in his office after his martyrdom. It says this and I quote,
[time=3241] "I am a part of the fellowship of the unashamed. The die has been cast. I have stepped over the line. The decision has been made. I am a disciple of Jesus Christ.
[time=3255] I won't look back, let up, slow down, back away or be still. My past is redeemed, my present makes sense, my future is secure.
[time=3264] I'm finished and done with low living, sight walking, smooth knees, colorless dreams, tamed visions, worldly talking, cheap giving and dwarfed goals.
[time=3276] My faith is set, my gate is fast, my goal is heaven, my road is narrow, my way is rough, my companions are few, my guide is reliable, my mission is clear.
[time=3288] I won't give up, shut up, let up until I have stayed up, stored up, prayed up and paid up for the cause of Christ.
[time=3295] I must go till he comes, give till I drop, preach till everyone knows, work till he stops me.
[time=3305] He comes for his own, he will have no problem recognizing me because my banner will have been clear."
[time=3314] I believe a passage such as this should fire that level of conviction in our heart to remember that we live for but a brief moment in time.
[time=3325] The greatest, most important thing we could ever do is serve wholeheartedly, unrelentingly and unapologetically for the cause of Christ.
[time=3332] Let's pray together.
[time=3335] Father, thank you for this glimpse into the future.
[time=3339] Our hearts overflow with a sense of gratitude that because of the sacrifice of Christ we will not be there.
[time=3346] And even more importantly, we won't be involved in what comes after that, the unrelenting torment of hell itself.
[time=3355] We are deserving of what we've read today.
[time=3358] We belong in that period of time.
[time=3360] Our sins speak loudly against us and leave no question that we would be the deserving ones of such torment and pain.
[time=3367] Nothing we have ever done or ever will do or ever could do would remove from us that just deserts of such a day.
[time=3377] It's unmerited favor, it's the grace of God, it's the mercy of God, it's the loving compassion of God that spares us from such a time as this.
[time=3388] And with hearts full of gratitude we thank you for sparing us.
[time=3393] Thank you for that moment when we have repented.
[time=3397] For that time of salvation when we changed our mind about ourselves and our false religious views and our sins and we clung to the cross of Christ.
[time=3406] And we love you and we praise you.
[time=3408] In Jesus' name, amen.
