[time=0] God does not allow the seventh trumpet to be blown.
[time=19] He stops at the sixth trumpet.
[time=23] The seventh is going to be blown in chapter 11, verse 15.
[time=25] But before that happens, there is this brief time, this intermission, this catch your breath,
[time=31] this be encouraged, be reminded that even though your world is falling apart, God is still
[time=37] in control.
[time=50] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=56] Thank you for joining us.
[time=58] What is the Christian supposed to hold on to when his world is falling apart?
[time=62] When God allows your life to turn out different than you thought it would, what should you hang on to?
[time=67] Today as we come to Revelation 10, God gives a group of tired, exhausted, frightened Christians
[time=73] five truths to hang on to when your world is falling apart.
[time=77] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them open to the book of Revelation chapter 10.
[time=82] Our special music today will be provided by Bill Laman and celebration.
[time=90] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=120] Who will fill the sky with raven stars through over and wide the light?
[time=134] Who knows the families of to the dwelling place of light?
[time=142] Creator Master, Holy Mass, the stinger of my soul.
[time=155] He raised it all and sent down, Almighty God, Almighty God, who used his words to lay on the
[time=178] foundations of the earth.
[time=193] To all of the other mighty sustainer of my soul, he raised it all and sent down, Almighty God,
[time=222] Almighty God, who used his words to lay on the foundations of the earth.
[time=240] He raised it all and sent down, Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God,
[time=286] Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God, Almighty God,
[time=315] If there were no manchains on the hills of glory, and there were no streets of gold,
[time=338] no walls of jasmine, no crest or river, O Lord, I'd still want to go.
[time=365] If there were no saints for me to talk to, and there were no loved ones caught on before,
[time=386] your joy pales ringing, no angel forcing, O Lord, I'd still want to go.
[time=406] When it does last for me, just as long as this face I see,
[time=427] Jesus died that I might be free, and with him is where I long to be.
[time=448] If there were no manchains on the hills of glory, and if there were no streets made of gold,
[time=469] all I'm looking for is Jesus, my heart, and that's why I still want to go.
[time=491] That's why I still want to go.
[time=506] Jesus, Jesus.
[time=523] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today, what a special privilege it is to have you with us.
[time=529] I just want to remind you that on Wednesday mornings, our staff gets together at Richard and Marge Meade, and I pray for those many requests that come in through the Bible Hour.
[time=541] We're encouraged by some of you that said that you had cancer treatments and that there was evidence that the chemotherapy had really helped you, and I'm really encouraged by those of you that wrote in and thanked us for praying for you.
[time=554] And I just want to remind you that when you send in a request, we are faithful in praying for that that God will intercede in your lives.
[time=562] Well as we're recording this, you're watching this on Mother's Day, but we're one week delayed,
[time=568] so I want to remind you that Pastor Moore will have a special Mother's Day message next Sunday on the Bible Hour.
[time=575] I hope you'll tune in and be with us and be encouraged, mothers, by his message.
[time=580] And then there are some events that I'd like to remind you of.
[time=584] Our sanctuary choir is going to be joining with Steve Green at the Fort Wayne Coliseum on Saturday evening, May 15th.
[time=592] You might want to come and join and see Steve Green, he's a marvelous musician.
[time=596] Our choir will join him for a couple of numbers on that evening, May 15th.
[time=601] You can call the Coliseum ticket office for information.
[time=605] And then another special event on Sunday night, May 23rd, our hand bell choir will be giving a mini concert.
[time=610] It'll be a beautiful concert.
[time=612] If you don't normally attend church on Sunday nights, I hope you'll join with us on that evening, May 23rd at 6 p.m.
[time=621] And finally, I want to remind you about our patriotic panorama.
[time=624] We're calling it Reflections on America from Sea to Shining Sea.
[time=629] That'll be on Sunday, June 27th at 4 p.m.
[time=633] I want to tell you that well in advance so that you can set aside the time and join with us for a great celebration of America.
[time=641] We are indeed thankful that we have the privilege to serve God in the United States of America.
[time=647] Now we're going to go back for some more music and then the message from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=652] Again, thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=677] We're going to go back to the church on Sunday, June 27th at 6 p.m. and we're going to go back to the church.
[time=705] The reason we sing, the reason we lift our voice is more than just making harmony.
[time=721] The reason we sing is to praise the one who gave his son to be.
[time=731] The reason we sing.
[time=741] More than just any motion, his spirit gives us joy that we can't hide.
[time=750] We will not be silent, we've got to let the world hear what's inside.
[time=758] And as we praise him with our music, Jesus is the one we glorify.
[time=774] The reason we sing, the reason we lift our voice is more than just making harmony.
[time=790] The reason we sing is to praise the one who gave his son to be.
[time=806] The reason we sing, the reason we lift our voice is more than just making harmony.
[time=838] The reason we sing is to praise the one who gave his son to be.
[time=854] The reason we sing.
[time=870] [APPLAUSE]
[time=878] Beautifully done, thank you, celebration.
[time=888] Come back and do that again.
[time=894] I'm excited to be here with you this morning.
[time=902] And this is an interesting chapter.
[time=914] Another said that as he approached the study of this chapter, he wondered what in the world he would say about it.
[time=926] I would like to approach this chapter with a couple of questions for you this morning.
[time=932] The first is what in the world are we supposed to hang on to when our world is falling apart?
[time=942] What are we supposed to hang on to when our world is falling apart?
[time=946] What do I hold on to when God is allowing my life to turn out much differently than I thought it would?
[time=962] I got a call yesterday from good friends of mine, Eric and Denise Costa.
[time=978] When I met them and when they met each other and when they were anticipating graduation and what would life be like after graduation?
[time=994] None of us expected them to, yesterday, to have delivered a little baby girl that within three hours had passed from this planet to go home and be with its Lord.
[time=1006] Life's much different for them than they had expected.
[time=1012] Paul and Julie DeCourt, a family at Grace Community Church in Southern California, where I grew up spiritually.
[time=1018] They were a leading couple. He had this gorgeous voice and would minister to us on Sunday mornings as he had opportunity.
[time=1024] It was an executive with Hannah Barbera. They had three kids. They were just kind of the family that everybody idolized, everybody liked.
[time=1032] But when he turned about 50, he had an unsuspected heart attack and he just dropped dead on the spot.
[time=1039] And Julie has been left these last many years with the question of how to continue to raise her kids and how to live the rest of her life without the men she loved.
[time=1048] They didn't anticipate that when they got married. They had no way to foresee that. Life's turning out much differently for Julie than she thought.
[time=1058] What's thinking about George and Jerry Shackleford, another couple back in my past at Grace Community Church.
[time=1065] I don't think when they got married and had their first son Rod and then later their second child, a daughter, they named her Stacey.
[time=1072] They had no idea that when Stacey was 13 years of age, she was going to be diagnosed with leukemia.
[time=1078] I was in a Sunday evening meeting with them. It's called search. It was a program for the kids. It was a prayer request time.
[time=1084] And George raised up his hand and said, "Our daughter's been diagnosed with leukemia." Stacey fought valiantly for three years, but later that cancer took its life when she was 16.
[time=1096] Life is dramatically different than they had anticipated. Thinking of Ray and Barbara Brown, another member at Grace Community Church, Ray and Barbara have three young, strong, strapping sons and they're the athletic family of the church and they bite together and run together and run marathons together and all of them college athletes and just the epitome of health and success.
[time=1119] Just doing tremendously as a salesman, they'd given him a huge territory. It was a toy company and he'd worked his way through that territory and built it up from ground zero.
[time=1128] And just when he was about 50 or 53, when the thing was reaping all kinds of fruit, the company fired him, brought in some younger men who they could pay less for the same job and raked the profits off the top and Ray and Barbara facing financial devastation.
[time=1146] Boy, life is different for them than when I met them. Thinking of another couple who will remain nameless, they met at a major Christian university. He was on the baseball team. She sang in a group like celebration for the university. They fell in love, they got married and they had absolutely no idea at that time that the sexual molestation that she received from her father and her brothers and her uncle when she was a little girl was going to cause the kind of emotional, relational trauma.
[time=1175] That they've been living in for the last five or six years. My life's different than they thought it would be.
[time=1185] It's thinking about Jeff and Peggy's on Jeff was a picture for the angels major league picture first string big time money all kinds of fame around the city.
[time=1196] Peggy had no idea when she fell in love with Jeff that after he retired from his professional baseball career, he would fall into the arms of another woman and have an adulterous affair and everything that she thought about for her life as far as being loved and supported and encouraged and he being faithful to her and the public disgrace boy.
[time=1213] He had no idea that was coming her way. Life's really different than she expected it to be.
[time=1222] We've been kind of enjoying a trip back to the future in the book of Revelation. We've been looking ahead by looking back at the writing of the Apostle John.
[time=1231] We've been seeing it from God's perspective. We've been kind of just rejoicing in the power and the awesomeness of God and the end of sin and death and Satan and demons.
[time=1241] And this eventual outcome in the book of Revelation with the new heaven and the new earth and we're all already in heaven by chapter five.
[time=1248] But you know there's some believers living down here on planet earth during this tribulation.
[time=1255] They're not all of the 144,000 the Jews that are sealed and protected. We're just talking normal average folk like you and me.
[time=1262] And they have lived now for the last six and a half years in war and famine and death. They have seen God shake the literal universe until the sky fell in on them.
[time=1274] They have seen fire and blood mixed together and scorches a third of the earth surface.
[time=1280] They've seen a great mountain crashing to the sea and turned it to blood, a third of the sea to blood. They've seen a star crashing to the earth's atmosphere, probably disintegrate and spoil a third of the earth's fresh water population.
[time=1293] They've lived it and it's gone on and on and on this way for them.
[time=1301] And I believe with all my heart that they've been grateful for their salvation. There's a sense of bohan, but I'm on the right side.
[time=1309] They've been encouraged. They've been preaching the word of God. I believe they've been carrying around the copy of the book of Revelation and showing anybody and everybody who'd listen.
[time=1316] See what we're living. It's right here.
[time=1319] I believe they've been doing that. They've been holding a strong testimony.
[time=1324] But I believe with all my heart that these are just normal average ordinary folks and they get discouraged just like the rest of us do.
[time=1331] In the last six and a half years as they've gone through all of the seals and the first six trumpet judgments, I'm sure they've lost loved ones.
[time=1340] Some of the ones they love have died. Maybe a husband or a wife has died or children have died.
[time=1345] I'm sure that as this earth waxes worse, they've had their children molested and raped and horrible things have happened to them.
[time=1355] They themselves have gone hungry and not had food by virtue of the worldwide famine.
[time=1359] They themselves have become sick at different points because of the disease that run rampant with the death and the carnage and all the result of war and its devastation.
[time=1369] They've been scared to death themselves by the shaking of the universe and seeing these pieces of stars crashing into planet earth and listening to the earthquake and feeling it tremble underneath their own feet.
[time=1381] In the last six and a half years they've lost dear friends, dear Christian friends.
[time=1386] Remember now the church is raptured. They're probably not meeting in buildings like this. They may not have opportunity to meet at all.
[time=1391] They may not have pastors, they may not have elders, they may not have deacons, they may not have sunny school classes. It may be all just unorganized Christianity during this brief period of time.
[time=1402] So the normal support systems that are here for you and me, may not be there for them.
[time=1407] Their friends have been martyred and their friends have died through natural causes.
[time=1414] They've gone without water. They've been caught in the unpredictable storms that are raging upon the earth because of this cataclysmic disturbance of the universe.
[time=1424] They've been confused, they're tired, they're full of disappointment, confusion, doubt, defeat and failure.
[time=1432] You know, I think these people are just normal Christians and I'll bet you that's pretty standard fare when you're living in the tribulation.
[time=1440] And so God pauses, God pauses to give them encouragement.
[time=1447] Chapter 10 and 11 is a pause of encouragement. It's an interlude of encouragement to strengthen the hearts of the believers who are living on planet earth.
[time=1456] You say also why do you believe that? The word encouragement doesn't even appear in chapter 10.
[time=1461] The word pause doesn't occur. Interlude. None of that stuff. Why do you think that this is what God is doing?
[time=1468] Well, hold your place in chapter 11. Come back with me to chapter 6 for a minute. I want to show you a pattern of God.
[time=1474] I believe it's very clear. Chapter 6 is all about the seven seals.
[time=1480] You remember it very well. Number one, worldwide peace, then open war, then famine, then death, then vengeance.
[time=1487] Then the sixth seal is physical disturbance and that's when the stars, verse 13 of the sky, are falling to the earth as a fig tree casts its unrighted figs when shaken by a great wind.
[time=1498] The sky is split apart like a scroll. Verse 15, the kings of the earth, the great men, the commanders, the rich, the strong, the slaves.
[time=1505] They're hiding themselves in caves and among rocks, verse 16, they have a death wish. They cry out that the rocks and the mountains would fall on them.
[time=1515] That's the first real series of judgment, those first six seals.
[time=1520] But do you remember? He doesn't jump right into the seventh seal. God pauses. He stops with chapter 7.
[time=1529] And we read in chapter 7 that great chapter of encouragement about world revival, 144,000 come to Christ and are sealed and are protected from the judgments.
[time=1540] And in verse 9 of chapter 7, after these things I looked and behold a great multitude which no one could count from every nation tried people in tongue.
[time=1549] So before he just moves in to the seventh seal which opens up all these seven trumpets, he pauses for a moment and reminds both we reading this now.
[time=1559] The people reading it then in the ancient world and especially the people reading it in the tribulation, hey God is it work.
[time=1568] God has not lost control. It just so happens that in this the greatest hour of terror on planet earth there is also the greatest revival that's ever occurred.
[time=1578] Having encouraged them he moves into the sixth trumpet judgments. We saw that last week in chapters 8 and 9.
[time=1585] But before he opens up or lets the seventh trumpet sound, the last part of chapter 9 only comes to the sixth trumpet.
[time=1594] Remember the army of 200 million demons that kill a third of the earth's population? That's the sixth trumpet but the seventh doesn't sound.
[time=1601] There's yet another pause. There's an interlude. And that's what we come to this morning. That's why I believe this is a time of encouragement for the saints particularly living on the earth.
[time=1612] Saying catch your breath. Be refreshed. God has not lost control. You know I tend to think God has lost control when a minor thing goes wrong in my life.
[time=1623] Something doesn't work out the way I thought man I'm starting to want to hate. Hello. Do you still love me? Is this really where you were leading me?
[time=1635] Is this really your plan for my life? The slightest disturbance, the slightest tribulation and I'm back here in my prayer closet asking God those kinds of questions.
[time=1644] Imagine what they're asking God. Why did I have to live in this period of time?
[time=1651] Why did my wife have to be killed by the beast? Why was it my lot in the scope of redemptive history to have to live in this particular time?
[time=1662] And don't forget it was trumpet five that released more demons than the world has ever seen.
[time=1670] As that angel goes down and unlocks the bottomless pit and out comes this roaring hoard like locus they cover everything and they have the sting like a scorpion only they have a spiritual sting not a physical one.
[time=1682] Boy it's different than ever before. And then this army of 200 million assembles into six trumpet and they're killing a third of all the earth's population.
[time=1691] I wonder if these people aren't asking in their own heart these believers man you know maybe this whole tribulation thing is gotten out of control maybe it's spinning out of control and even God can't control it anymore.
[time=1702] Maybe now that these demons are out God's kind of up there going oh oh whoa what's our auxiliary plan.
[time=1711] Sirens are going off lights are flashing trouble trouble trouble no God says no God says no I'm still in control.
[time=1721] Let me give you five truths to hold on to when your world is falling apart from chapter 10 five truths and they're all about God.
[time=1729] They're all about God.
[time=1732] First one is this God is sovereign God is sovereign God is in control read with me verses one through three.
[time=1741] In contrast to all these demons and all these angels that are evil angels that are running all over the earth and doing all this death.
[time=1749] Chapter 10 verse one I saw another strong angel coming down out of heaven.
[time=1755] He was clothed with a cloud remember God the she kind of glory he's got on the clothing of God.
[time=1763] And there's a rainbow upon his head that's the promise of God and his face was like the sun oftentimes Christ faces depicted as beaming like the sun.
[time=1773] His feet are like pillars of fire remember the feet of Christ in the vision in chapter one like iron.
[time=1780] And in his hand there's a little book which was open I believe that's the scroll of chapter five that's the seven seals he's got it in his hand.
[time=1789] Now look at what he does this is what's so significant.
[time=1792] It's beautiful gorgeous strong angel this isn't Christ this is one who has come from the presence of Christ and is adorned as if just coming from the presence of Christ.
[time=1800] What's he do he places his right foot on the sea at his left on the land.
[time=1808] And he cries out with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he cried out the seven peels of thunder uttered their voices.
[time=1816] You say what's the significance of this angel placing his foot on the sea and another foot on the land.
[time=1824] No need to turn there but do to run me 11 24 God says the nation of Israel every place on which the soul of your foot shall try shall be yours.
[time=1836] I believe this is an emblematic way that God sends one of his mighty strong messengers adorned as if in the very presence of God.
[time=1843] And this I don't think he's standing on a seaside here and he's got one thing on the sand and one in the ocean as if it's a human size.
[time=1850] I think this is a monstrous angel just gigantic as big as your imagination will allow you to envision him and he plants one foot firmly in the middle of an ocean and the other in the middle of a continent.
[time=1863] And he stands there with the scroll of God in his hand the title deed of the earth and he roars like a lion.
[time=1871] This is an incredible picture is roaring comes out of Joel chapter three verse 15 it's a picture of the day of the Lord that God gave to the Old Testament prophet Joel listen to this.
[time=1883] The sun and the moon grow dark well that sounds familiar that's what's going on here and the stars lose their brightness yep that's happening and the Lord roars from Zion and utters his voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the earth tremble.
[time=1900] But the Lord is a refuge for his people.
[time=1907] God has always depicted this final day of the Lord in which the Lord would absolutely roar like a lion before it takes its final leap upon its prey.
[time=1919] So God is saying in no uncertain terms to people whose life has been infested with evil angels and who may be suspecting that this whole thing has spun out of control.
[time=1933] He says let me show you through the word of God something I won't let you see with your eyes.
[time=1938] I believe this angel is invisible there's nothing to indicate that he could be actually seen by the people on the earth and let me make a dramatic representation of my sovereignty by sending this massive strong angel.
[time=1952] Physically displaying my sovereignty over all that is in the ocean over all that is on the earth he holds in his hand the title deed to all that is and he roars like a roaring lion crying out the judgment of God I am in control.
[time=1970] And he's answered by these seven peals of thunder. Now I bet they heard that I bet they actually hear this enormous thundering of God as he answers back to the angel who is roaring.
[time=1986] Thunder has always been a picture of judgment in the word of God won't take time to develop that for you this morning. Jeremiah 25, Habakkuk 111, Joel chapter 3, the thunder always speaks when God is speaking of judgment of his great divine truth.
[time=2008] So truth number one when you feel like your world is absolutely falling apart and you're fearful that maybe God has let this thing spin out of control.
[time=2020] Just remember that behind the scenes in places you can't see God is demonstrating his absolute sovereignty. He is in total complete absolute control.
[time=2032] Principle number two or truth number true to hang on to look at me at verse four. This is amazing. Apparently these peals of thunder had content this judgment that thunders from heaven actually had content.
[time=2046] And when the seven peals of thunder had spoken I was about to write this is John speaking and of course he had been commissioned to write everything he saw in chapter one.
[time=2056] So he hears the thunder he hears the content in the thunder and he begins to write it all down.
[time=2064] But there's a voice from heaven saying seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have spoken and do not write them.
[time=2070] In other words this is not for public consumption I let you write what you saw in the seven seals I let you write what you heard the seven trumpets I'm going to let you write what you see in the outpouring of the seven bowls of judgment but these seven peals of thunder you're not allowed to communicate that to anybody.
[time=2088] It's not for public consumption and that often happens in prophecy in Daniel's life he had received a great vision about the evenings and the mornings and we don't know a lot about it because in Daniel 826 it says and the vision of the evenings and the mornings which has been told us it's true.
[time=2106] But keep the vision secret for it pertains to many days in the future God wouldn't let him communicate it. Paul and 2 Corinthians 12.4 said I was caught up into paradise and heard inexpressible words which a man is not permitted to speak you know Paul wrote most of the New Testament and he wrote most of those out of the visions he received we believe while in the Arabian desert receiving all the revelation of God there to communicate to us the mystery of the Jew and the Gentile and the body of Christ all this stuff we read.
[time=2135] But there's other stuff he didn't write. There's other knowledge there's other truth that's outside our perusal God holds it back from us.
[time=2147] God hasn't told us everything. The question why is God allowing this to happen to me. The question why is God a holy and a righteous God allowing my son to die or my husband to cheat on me or my business to go bankrupt or
[time=2164] why has God allowed my daughter to be molested. These would be the kinds of questions that these people are asking in this day. Why did I have to watch my little daughter starve to death in the famine. Why did I have to see my son his throat pars and his tongue swell as he died from drinking poison water. But the world.
[time=2186] No, we don't know everything. We don't know the answers to those questions. The only answer to that question is we know we don't know everything. God knows more than we know. God hasn't told us everything and there should be some consolation in that.
[time=2202] Because there really are a lot of significant questions when you're living in that fire that you don't have answers to.
[time=2208] And what God wants us to do is submit to the fact that he has chosen not to tell us everything. He doesn't owe us an explanation is the point.
[time=2220] One of my favorite verses along this line or this truth or this principle and we often only quote the first part of it. You probably could quote it from memory.
[time=2230] The secret things belong to the Lord our God but the things reveal belong to us and to our sons forever and that's usually where people stop quoting it. They say you know the mysteries of God they belong to God what's been given to us belongs to us.
[time=2246] But the first does go on. It says this. The secret things belong to the Lord our God but the things reveal belong to us and to our sons forever and then there's a that.
[time=2258] In order that we may observe all the words of this law. See the point is he hasn't told us everything but everything he has told us were obligated to obey.
[time=2270] In seminary had a wonderful professor Dr. Mark Mueller. He taught us theology one and theology two and that's where you get into some of the deep stuff about God and some of the deep stuff about predestination and double predestination and all the different forms of the decrees and when this happened and when that happened and as a bunch of young guys.
[time=2287] He had to fire in questions at him that frankly he couldn't answer. He just couldn't answer. We put him in a box and we place him and we had to find say I don't know. I don't know the answer to your questions.
[time=2304] Questions like if God created everything and if God is the first cause of everything then why isn't God responsible for sin.
[time=2315] Questions like if God is omnipotent and God can create anything then can he create a rock so big he can't lift it up. Questions he couldn't answer.
[time=2326] And he would look straight in the eye and he turned over to Deuteronomy 29 and said man I can't answer all your questions because the Bible doesn't answer all your questions because God is interested in answering all your questions.
[time=2338] He's given you revelation what he wants you to do is obey what he's given you and humble your heart and humble your mind before an infinite mind and be content to know you don't know everything and you won't always get all your answers answered.
[time=2353] Maybe they all get answered in heaven. Maybe the most used word in heaven will be the word.
[time=2360] Maybe we'll just be up there and he'll just be answering that question then he'll answer that question. Now I see. I don't know maybe yes maybe no.
[time=2373] But the point is for right now folks we don't have all the information and it's nice to know we don't have all the information because then when we can't make sense of a situation we can just rest in that reality.
[time=2381] I'm really confused but I'm gonna obey. I'm gonna stay faithful. I'm gonna stay on track.
[time=2392] So principle number two the thing you want to hang on to when you feel your life is falling apart is the realization that God has not told us everything.
[time=2400] Number three comes out of verses five and six and the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to have any prepared to take an oath which you then did in verse six and swore by him who lives forever and ever who created heaven and the things in it and the earth and the things in it and the sea and the things in it.
[time=2421] That this is his oath. There shall be delay no longer. When your world is falling apart I want you to remember that God is on schedule.
[time=2437] God is not only sovereign. God not only knows more than I know about everything but he's right on schedule and that is the hard part when you get in the trial.
[time=2446] That is the difficult part when you are under pressure and God is applying a significant amount of pressure to strip from your life things that he knows must be stripped.
[time=2456] And it hurts and you're tired of being under there you want to get out and you want to say how long oh lord how long will you cause me to endure this.
[time=2467] And we want to question his divine timetable we want to question his ability to orchestrate all the events of our life we want to say hey you're being unjust here God this is going on too long.
[time=2478] Well may I strengthen your courage by saying God has been orchestrating every single event in human history since its inception and he hasn't been late once.
[time=2489] Never he never forgot he never huh my lands I got a hustle just never happens it just doesn't happen that way God just moves with exact precision and he is moving in exact precision in your life.
[time=2507] He will not hold you under longer than you can and that is best for you.
[time=2513] So what are you saying here in the oath of this angel in this context there shall be delay no longer God is saying to evil your days are running out this is your last domain.
[time=2526] God is saying to the demons this is your last day of liberty God is saying to the godless men this is your last chance to repent and God is saying to the believers living on the planet at this time this is your last suffering.
[time=2544] I will delay no longer the end is coming and with the blast of that seventh trumpet everything begins to move so fast and so quickly in the day of the Lord is there.
[time=2557] Verse 7 look at it but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he is about to sound then the mystery of God is finished as he preached to his servants the prophets.
[time=2570] Some people believe that history is cyclical they believe in reincarnation and they take it in all different forms and shapes and sizes under all kinds of different false religious terms.
[time=2580] They believe that we basically are moving through a cycle of life and it comes over and over and over and over and over again and what we have lived today we will live tomorrow in another life we may live it from a different vantage we may live it from a different perspective but it's just an ongoing endless sense of a cyclical movement in history and for them history has no meaning.
[time=2599] It's not going anywhere it's not culminating it doesn't ever end it doesn't add up to anything they may try to find their own personal significance inside this repeating cycle.
[time=2610] Ultimately they might may try to reach a place of nothingness called nirvana where the fact that it repeats itself over and over and over again ceases to matter to them but for them history has absolutely no meaning.
[time=2623] They're going nowhere others view history in somewhat of an atheistic existential way in other words history is just a long line we don't know where it began we don't know where it ends we get some little slice out of it and all we can do is make the very most of it we can.
[time=2641] It's not heading anywhere it's not going anywhere it didn't come from anywhere these people are disillusioned but God is saying is I'm going to bring this all to culmination it's all been on schedule it's all moving in a particular direction history God says is working out my purpose as I explain it in the word of God.
[time=2663] History is a sovereign God in providential care over all the events of all the ages moving it to his appointed end and Christ is the main person of all of history and he will be exalted in that position.
[time=2679] God started it God controls it and God is bringing it to conclusion and let me tell you friends when you're in the heat of the fiery furnace.
[time=2688] And you're wondering if your life and your world is falling apart in your stripped of your dignity and your stripped of your sense of well being and you're wondering why it's nice to know.
[time=2700] That God has not allowed this thing to be some random help or skelter cyclical repeating thing or some long never ending line.
[time=2715] Truth number four look at verses eight and nine and ten.
[time=2720] Boy this one really meets the makes the rubber meet the road.
[time=2724] The voice which I heard from heaven I heard again speaking with me and saying go take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.
[time=2734] And I went to the angel telling him to give me the little book and he said to me take it and eat it and it will make your stomach bitter but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.
[time=2744] And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and when I had eaten it in my stomach was made bitter.
[time=2754] What is this? This is the apostle John being instructed to eat the word of God that little scroll we've already read much of that we are in the process of studying that's the word of God.
[time=2765] And it's not uncommon for us to be instructed as believers to feast upon the word of God to long for the pure milk of the word like a newborn babe in other words it's this graphic picture of so assimilating and taking the word of God into yourself as if you've eaten it.
[time=2778] It begins to work its way through your body and energize you and give you strength.
[time=2785] So that seems pretty clear John eat the word of God assimilate it receive it take it into yourself but be warned as you do that it'll be a bitter sweet experience.
[time=2797] It'll be sweet in the context of this book because this is the ultimate day of the glorification of Christ it'll be sweet because sin is conquered once and forever.
[time=2807] It's sweet because Satan and demons are destroyed it's sweet because the kingdom of God comes to earth in the millennial kingdom.
[time=2816] But it's bitter because it's full of bloodshed and wrath and vengeance and judgment and it inevitably takes people to hell.
[time=2826] God in the book of Ezekiel is seen there weeping with tears over the judgment that he brings upon people even for God it is a bitter sweet experience.
[time=2839] You know what that's the way it is with the word and the will of God that's the way it is with the will and the word of God.
[time=2846] It's a bitter sweet experience Paul knew that Paul was so thrilled to be saved Paul was so sweetly surrounded in the grace of God and he found his greatest and highest privilege in calling to go tell everybody he could find about the grace of God.
[time=2861] And as he writes back to these believers at Philippi and at the festival in Ica and at Ephesus he always says my heart is full of joy and I'm constantly rejoicing and praying for you that you've come to the sweet knowledge of Christ.
[time=2877] But at the same time it was bitter listen to his words in Romans chapter 9 he understands the judgment of God upon the nation of Israel for having rejected the Messiah and he says there I am telling the truth in Christ I'm not lying my conscience is bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart.
[time=2900] He's overwhelmed with the bitterness of the will and the word of God for the nation of Israel he says then in verse 3 for I could wish that I myself were accursed separated from Christ for the sake of my brother and my kinsman according to the flesh.
[time=2916] He knows what's awaiting his kinsman he knows what's awaiting his brother and he says from the depth of his heart he says I'm telling you the truth I'm not lying I'd be happy to trade places.
[time=2927] So bitter is my feeling about their burning and hell forever and they're losing out on the eternal kingdom of God I know I've got that I know I'm saved I'd be willing to trade places I'd be willing to take hell and give the nation of Israel life in Christ.
[time=2945] The bitter sweet experience of the will of God for your life when you walk through the fiery parts of your life and life isn't turning out the way you thought it was going to turn out there's a there's a bitterness there because there's such disillusionment and there's so much pain that's so drastically different and typically involves some type of public embarrassment in your your image or your self esteem is being heard and you're just you're just warped and racked with pain and sorrow and it's not how you wanted it it's bitter.
[time=2974] But at the same time there's a sweetness in that because you know that this is God's refining hand stripping the draw out of your life breaking you humbling you tearing you down to a place where you can cry out with to God and say just let me be whatever you want me to be.
[time=2993] The passage of faith moving from this place to this place moving from a place where God is seen as the cosmic vending machine and you plug into him a couple of spiritual quarters and he pops out whatever you've asked for moving past that elementary that young faith in God and moving through the hardship of life over to a different kind of faith that believes in God even when there's no experiential reason to even though when he hasn't given you what you wanted
[time=3019] even though when your life didn't work out like you want it to you believe there's a passage of pain and sorrow the bitter sweet will of God for your life.
[time=3033] Abraham walk through it Peter walked through it the great men of God walk through that passage and came to embrace and welcome the bitter sweet will of God.
[time=3048] So what am I to do in my world is falling apart I am to remember that God is sovereign even though it doesn't appear that way to me.
[time=3056] I am to remember that God hasn't told me everything I don't have complete knowledge I can't make an assessment of this situation I don't have all the facts.
[time=3066] I'm to remember that God is on schedule he's moving with the same decisive purpose that he has through all the ages.
[time=3075] And I have to remember that God's will is bitter sweet that's nothing new that's nothing extraordinary that's nothing different that shouldn't be unexpected that's par for the course.
[time=3091] Principle number five look at verse 11 I like this part so much.
[time=3098] And they said to me speaking back to John you must prophesy again concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
[time=3108] John himself is in a bitter sweet experience he has been exiled to the island of Patmos all of his buddies have been martyred he wonders he's watches Christianity hanging in the balance.
[time=3118] He doesn't know if this thing's going to go anywhere at all he doesn't know what we know but God reminds him I've called you John to a specific purpose your mission is to write this book you must prophesy this is a book of prophecy you must write this book concerning many peoples and many nations and tongues and kings.
[time=3140] You know I draw from this I draw this truth God is making my life count God is making my life count in his plan of redemptive history.
[time=3152] Let me try to make this clear I'll never forget reading an account of a guy who fought in World War II.
[time=3161] And he and his troops his comrades have been sent to a Japanese infested island somewhere in the South Pacific and they had fought a bloody battle.
[time=3171] And many of his buddies had been wounded and many of his buddies had died and his own life at different points had been put at risk and he now since that day carries the burden and the emotional baggage of having lived that hard experience.
[time=3185] They eventually took the island and they were relieved of duty. But it was years after that when the Pentagon declassified some information about World War II and he found their report about that conflict on that very island in which he had fought and in which his friends had lost their lives.
[time=3203] And the assessment of the Pentagon was this that that battle those battles on that island had absolutely no consequence in the outcome of World War II it was pointless it was meaningless they never should have sent men there.
[time=3218] If a Japanese on that island had never been killed if they had never taken that island it wouldn't have made one hill of beans a difference in the outcome of the war.
[time=3227] And the guy just articulated the absolute sinking feeling in his heart and his life we died we fought we suffered for nothing.
[time=3238] You know what God never ever does that in the life of a believer. God never asks you to take a stand or to suffer or to go through some fiery situation without having it count for the cause of Christ.
[time=3253] He never does that. He has designed you uniquely and with special purpose in mind Ephesians 2.10 says that he has created us his workmanship in Christ to perform the good works which he has prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=3271] Each one of us as we walk an obedience to the word of God can be guaranteed a significant contribution to redemptive history even though like Joseph we may not understand it see it or perceive it when we're doing it.
[time=3286] Joseph had no idea that his being sold by his own brothers to an Egyptian bunch of slaves on their way to Egypt that his being thrown again in prison for refusing sex with Pharaoh's wife.
[time=3298] He had no idea as he was walking through that experience that he would be the very one to create the womb for the nation of Israel to come and multiply it as supernatural growth rate and exit some years later for 2 million strong. He didn't understand all that.
[time=3312] I believe he does today. I believe he does today.
[time=3317] And though your life and mine I've may not be used at that grand scheme. I believe that God is as interested in using your life for the cause of Christ as he was Joseph.
[time=3331] So when it's all break and loose and you're questioning the hand of God in your life your world is falling apart and you don't seem to have any place to put your feet.
[time=3343] Relationships in your life are coming apart and your physical health may be ailing or your financial situation is crumbling or you can't seem to achieve educational goals that you've set in your life to open a new vista that you've wanted so desperately to involve yourself.
[time=3358] You realize that God is bringing you in and through that experience so that out of your heart will emerge a kind of faith that comes only through brokenness.
[time=3368] A faith that can only touch your life when you can say I don't know all the answers I don't understand all that God is doing and frankly I don't even demand all the answers.
[time=3378] I just want to submit to his will for my life and as I do that and as I see the fray and as I see all that I can't interpret I want to remember that God is sovereign that God hasn't told me everything that God is exactly on schedule that God's will is often a bittersweet experience and that God is making my life count somehow in his plan for redemptive history this will not be for not.
