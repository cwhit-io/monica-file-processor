[time=12] And so the obvious question begins to ask itself in our head, "Why is God allowing this to happen to me?
[time=20] How can I continue to pray to a God who would allow that kind of thing to happen in my life?"
[time=28] [MUSIC]
[time=40] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=47] Thank you for joining us.
[time=49] Some of the most common questions asked by Christians when tragedy strikes in their lives are, "How can a loving God allow this to happen to me?" If God is really there, and if He really loves me, why is he allowing this to happen?
[time=63] How can I continue to pray to a God who would allow this kind of thing to continue in my life?
[time=68] These are not only common questions, but important ones also.
[time=72] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore seeks to help us answer these questions from our study of God's Word.
[time=79] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available.
[time=82] Pastor Moore will be leading us to several passages.
[time=85] Our special music today will be provided by Becky Woman and Reflection.
[time=94] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=101] [MUSIC]
[time=113] My faith has found a resting place
[time=119] not in device or creed.
[time=127] I trust the ever-living one His words for me shall be.
[time=138] I need no other argument, I need no other reason.
[time=148] It is enough that she's a star, and that He died for me.
[time=163] [MUSIC]
[time=166] My life is meaning of the Word, the written Word of God.
[time=175] Salvation, God, life, Savior's name.
[time=179] Salvation through His blood.
[time=186] I need no other argument, I need no other reason.
[time=197] It is enough that Jesus died, and that He died for me.
[time=211] [MUSIC]
[time=216] My grave will see, shine, heels of sin, the laws He came to save.
[time=230] For me His precious, for me shall.
[time=236] For me His life began.
[time=243] [MUSIC]
[time=251] I need no other argument, I need no other reason.
[time=265] It is enough that Jesus died, and that He died for me.
[time=292] [MUSIC - 10 seconds]
[time=320] Smile, make them think you're happy.
[time=330] Smile, and say that things are fine.
[time=338] And hide that empty longing that you feel.
[time=344] Don't ever show it, just keep your heart concealed.
[time=357] Why are the days so lonely?
[time=365] I wonder where, where can my heart go free?
[time=375] And who will draw the tears that no one's seen?
[time=381] There must be someone to share your silent means.
[time=393] Caught like a leaf in the wind, looking for a friend, where could you turn?
[time=402] Whisper the words of a prayer, and you'll find Him there.
[time=408] Arms open wide, love in His eye.
[time=416] Jesus, He needs to wear your heart.
[time=424] Oh, Jesus, He heals your secret scars.
[time=432] All the love you're longing for is Jesus, the friend of a wounded heart.
[time=445] Joy comes like the morning, and hope deepens as you grow.
[time=464] And peace beyond the reaches of your soul comes flowing through you.
[time=474] For love has made you whole.
[time=483] One like a leaf in the wind, looking for a friend, where could you turn?
[time=491] Oh, you spoke the words of a prayer, and you found Him there.
[time=497] Arms open wide, love in His eye.
[time=506] Jesus, He needs to wear your heart.
[time=513] Oh, Jesus, He heals your secret scars.
[time=522] All the love you're longing for is Jesus, the friend of a wounded heart.
[time=538] Oh, Jesus, He heals your secret scars.
[time=547] All the love you're longing for is Jesus, the friend of a wounded heart.
[time=564] Oh, friend of a wounded heart.
[time=610] Well, once again, it's really great to feel the presence of the Lord as we worship here in the sanctuary of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=622] I hope a little bit of that feeling is coming through the television so that you too can enjoy the joy of the Lord in His presence as you worship with us.
[time=630] And thank you for joining us today.
[time=633] I want to tell you about a special event. It's an annual event here at Black Hawk Baptist Church, the Patriotic Panorama.
[time=639] That will be on June 27th at 4 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=644] This year we're calling it Reflections on America from C to Shining C.
[time=649] Next week, I'll be playing some of the music that we sang last year just to give you kind of the flavor of the atmosphere on that particular Sunday.
[time=658] Let me give you the date again. It's Sunday, June 27th at 4 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=665] And then just before we go back to the live portion of our service, I want to offer to you one more time the book LA Justice.
[time=672] A number of you have written in for it. It's written by Bob Vernon.
[time=676] It talks about the situation when the Rodney King episode took place in California.
[time=682] And some of the response and the responsibility that we have as family members to protect and to live the Christian life.
[time=690] I hope you'll write for it today at the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Lane Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=700] And if you can, please enclose a donation of $15 to help defray the cost of the book.
[time=720] Let me just give you to his presence and my feeling is standing on the ground.
[time=730] Seems I'm closing out to touch you and my heart can hear you speaking without a song.
[time=744] Something was first and he silent, but his glory filled the temple through and through.
[time=754] I just came into his presence in the holy place with Jesus.
[time=762] I just came into his presence, I lay blue.
[time=778] I lay blue, I lay blue. I lay blue, I lay blue. I just came into his presence, I lay blue.
[time=799] I want to be quiet, Lord, and let you do the talking.
[time=812] I want to stay close to you. Together we'll go walking.
[time=825] I want to be ready, Lord, to do what you tell me to.
[time=838] I want to be quiet, Lord, and let you do the talking.
[time=858] I lay blue, I lay blue. I just came into his presence, I lay blue.
[time=874] I lay blue, I lay blue. I lay blue, I lay blue. I just came into his presence, I lay blue.
[time=887] I lay blue, I just came into his presence, I lay blue.
[time=918] (Applause)
[time=924] Thank you, reflection. It's been a wonderful morning already, hasn't it, just with the music and the worship.
[time=930] And let me invite you now to take your Bibles and come back to the book of Revelation and open there to chapter 10.
[time=938] We've already two lords a day ago, study chapter 10, and we'll just touch your briefly this morning to kind of springboard into our message.
[time=948] You remember Revelation chapter 10 caused us to ask the question, what do I do when my world is falling apart?
[time=956] Revelation chapter 10 describes a picture behind the scenes of God that is meant to be a great source of encouragement to some people who love Christ,
[time=967] who are believers. The rapture of the church has already occurred, but they have come to Christ since the tribulation has begun.
[time=974] They're probably on planet Earth now for some six and a half years, and the world is falling apart.
[time=981] There have been disease and war and famine and death and physical disturbance by this time, like the world has never seen before.
[time=989] And many of these believers have lived through this, and they have not been immune to it.
[time=994] It has touched their lives in very personal ways. They've lost a husband or a wife, or they've seen their children starve to death, or they've seen good friends taken from them.
[time=1005] And it's lasted a long time, six and a half years, and Revelation 10 is known as an interlude of encouragement.
[time=1013] It stops at the end of the sixth trumpet, before the seventh trumpet blows, which opens up a whole new battery of God's judgment and the seven bulls that will come and even a quicker rapid pace and more rapid pace with a more severe judgment.
[time=1028] But before those happen, those seven bulls are poured out on planet Earth. God seems to stop and pause in Revelation 10 and 11 to give perspectives so that believers can catch their breath.
[time=1042] And what he does in Revelation 10 is he reassures us that he is still in charge. It's a chapter all about the sovereignty of God.
[time=1050] And we won't go back through it this morning. If you missed the message, you might pick up the tape and be refreshed and encouraged in your heart, five elements of the sovereignty of God that give us perspective and something to hang on to when our world is indeed falling apart.
[time=1066] But in thinking about this a little bit over the last week or two, it dawned on me that it's when life is really hard and incredibly difficult circumstances find their way into our lives.
[time=1077] That really the truth about the sovereignty of God becomes a stumbling block rather than a help for a lot of us.
[time=1085] For most of us, it is the fact that God is sovereign that causes so much distress. It's the fact that God is in charge that makes the whole thing so difficult to understand.
[time=1096] And as you remember, we talked about the death of a child or the adultery of a mate or the death of a husband or a financial situation where your company went bankrupt.
[time=1106] It's the fact that God is sovereign that makes those circumstances so difficult to understand and to cope with.
[time=1114] And the tape begins to play in your head and questions begin to be asked like, why is God allowing this to happen to me?
[time=1120] If he really is sovereign, if he really is in charge, then why this in my life?
[time=1127] How can I continue to pray to a God who would allow that kind of thing to happen to me? Just even this week, one of the men that I have the privilege of discipling, the first words that came out of his mouth as we met in my office this week, he described a horrible heart-wrenching situation that brought tears to both his eyes and my eyes as something was going on with one of his children.
[time=1149] And it was, I can't go into the details obviously, but just a horrible situation. And having described that, he said, I've been living with this for a long time now and I'm finding it very difficult to pray to God.
[time=1162] Why would a loving sovereign God allow this to happen in my life? And when I take it to him in prayer, he does nothing about it.
[time=1170] You see, oftentimes it's the truth that God is sovereign that causes us as believers to struggle the most with the circumstances in our lives.
[time=1179] How can he allow this and still be a loving God? It's a question that's really asked quite frequently by Christians.
[time=1187] If he's sovereign and he's letting this happen, then he's still loving. Is he just? Is he holy? Is he righteous? I don't understand. It doesn't compute.
[time=1197] And so having addressed the sovereignty of God in Revelation chapter 10, I want to take a few moments this morning and try to deal with the fact and how we are supposed to think about the sovereignty of God in our lives even when life becomes very, very difficult.
[time=1214] And to do that, I want to begin by asking you to come with me to Luke chapter 11. Luke chapter 11. And I find that even among strong Christians, the issue eventually comes back to questioning the character of God, the character of God.
[time=1236] In verses 11 and 13, really in this whole beginning part of this chapter, Jesus is giving instruction about prayer. And he strikes at the question we've raised in verses 11 through 13 of Luke chapter 11. It says this.
[time=1249] Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish. He will not give him a snake instead of a fish. Will he?
[time=1259] Or if he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion. Will he? If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more shall your heavenly father give you the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
[time=1278] The Roman Askis came into our lives about four or five years ago. Mr. Roman Askis is a pastor in Utah. He's really a missionary for the gospel. He has landed his ministry or God has placed him in ministry right in the middle of Mormonsville.
[time=1293] If you will, everybody there is a Mormon. Everybody he talks to, the people he buys his groceries from, the people who fix his car, the people that he socializes with at the softball games. He's right in the heart of Mormon country in Utah.
[time=1306] As you might expect, he and his wife, they have two daughters about ready to graduate from high school at this time and then a younger son about nine years of age. They had not enjoyed a remarkably fruitful ministry. They hadn't seen great numbers of people come to Christ. Their church hadn't been involved in huge building programs. They weren't asked to go speak places. They were just struggling for the glory of God and for people to comprehend the reality of Jesus Christ in a very hostile environment.
[time=1335] They had a hope and a dream though. They've been waiting for their two daughters to come of age to come to be sophomores and juniors in high school because they had anticipated planned and saved all their lives really for their daughters to go to a Christian college.
[time=1351] It was their plan to leave Utah for a little trip with their family and check out some of these Christian colleges in Southern California. The Master's College, where I ministered was one of those, another would have been Biola, another would have been Azusa.
[time=1364] Give the kids an opportunity to look and see for themselves which place they'd like to go to college.
[time=1369] Well, that great, great they finally came and they loaded up their family, mom and dad, the little boy, the two daughters and then they'd also been ministering to two foreign exchange students, taking them into their home as yet another opportunity to present the gospel in a meaningful way to people who needed to know Christ.
[time=1385] They all pile into the car before they left. They prayed to God for traveling mercies. They asked that God would give them a safe trip.
[time=1394] They asked that God would keep them safe on this very important time and even beyond the physical safety really allow the spirit of God to work in their hearts to help them decide which college would it be for their daughters.
[time=1407] They left and arrived safely in California. Their first stop was the Master's College. They were thrilled to see the campus and Pastor Romanoski had been feeding on John MacArthur's tapes for many years.
[time=1418] It was a thrill for him to meet John and see some of the faculty and the facility and their daughters were overwhelmed with the dorms and the music department they wanted to go into the music ministry.
[time=1428] So they were anticipating singing in the choirs there at the college and they got to see the music department and receive all the admissions material.
[time=1436] With joy in their heart and a great sense of satisfaction they were going now to another Christian college. They started heading east on Placerita Canyon.
[time=1444] I drove that road every day of my life when I lived there and it heads into another kind of a major street. See here a highway. It would be a lot like Coliseum here.
[time=1454] A major street, you know, laying two lanes going in opposite directions, signals periodically to let cross traffic come.
[time=1461] Mom and dad were in the front seat with their little boy, the two foreign exchange students were in the middle seat and their two daughters were in the back, kind of the jumper seats of the station wagon. It was a hot day so they had the back window down.
[time=1473] As they were approaching Sierra Highway, Mr. Romanoski did not notice the red light of the signal. Mr. Romanoski only has one eye. One of them is glass. The other is the one that works. He's legal. It's okay for him to drive but it does impair his ability.
[time=1488] He rolled through the red light. Nobody else in the car saw it either when they got to the intersection. They were hit by a van going 50 miles an hour.
[time=1497] It spun their car around. Mom and dad and junior were okay. The two foreign exchange students were taken to the hospital and treated for internal injuries. Their two precious lovely daughters were catapulted out the back end of the station wagon and died in that intersection.
[time=1520] Heidi and I had the privilege of bringing the Romanoskis into our home for that remaining next week as they cared for their daughters and tried to figure out how to have transportation home because their car had been totaled.
[time=1533] Mr. Romanoski accounted to us that as he finally came to his senses and pulled himself out of his car and began to look around him at what happened. He couldn't believe his eyes.
[time=1543] As he saw laying there on the hot pavement of the Santa Clarita Valley, his two beloved daughters.
[time=1554] Now suppose one of you fathers is asked by his son for a fish. He will not give him a snake instead of a fish. Will he?
[time=1563] Or if he is asked for an egg, he will not give him a scorpion. Will he? If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?
[time=1578] What had God the Father given to the Romanoskis that day? Fish or snake? Egg or scorpion?
[time=1591] It's a difficult question, isn't it?
[time=1594] And I want to make a comment here. Jesus is not calling us as he speaks in this passage to play some type of mental game in our heads and to begin to call snakes eggs and scorpions fish.
[time=1605] I mean to call blue red and red blue just to walk through life and when anything happens bad, just say to yourself, well I've got a Heavenly Father that really can't be bad.
[time=1613] So I'll just choose to view it differently as if we get involved in some stupid mind manipulation positive thinking endeavor.
[time=1619] Jesus is the truth. He said the truth shall set you free. Coming to Christ is all about coming to embrace reality for what it is.
[time=1627] That would be the opposite of what Jesus would teach us. He is saying that what appears to you as a scorpion, what appears to you as a snake is in reality exactly what you need.
[time=1641] A fish and an egg. And the problem that we have is understanding that and allowing ourselves to perceive what God has done as what it really is instead of our own kind of personal agenda that we bring to the events of our lives.
[time=1660] I believe that we as believers even as mature believers, we have this certain parameter of life that God needs to fit us into. In other words God, work my life out and yes I love you and yes I'll serve you and yes I'll do what you want.
[time=1674] But make sure it stays within these boundaries of acceptable norms, of happiness, of reasonableness, of joy. Don't you dare move my life outside of these parameters and if you do I'll call you're doing that a snake and a scorpion.
[time=1695] You say the Christians really do that. Well come with me. Will you to one more place? The Old Testament this time the book of Job and I want to spend the remainder of our time looking at his life.
[time=1708] I've mentioned him too you often and alluded to the truth that is in this book. But Job better than anyone else struggles with the sovereignty of God.
[time=1716] Job better than anyone else struggles with this notion of has he given me a snake or has he given me an egg. A scorpion or a fish.
[time=1727] And so we look briefly at kind of the mountaintops of the book of Job and Glean from it. How we should perceive God.
[time=1735] As you remember there in Luke 11 the question is can I really trust God is he really righteous. If you being evil he says to earthly fathers know how to give what is good how much more than your heavenly father i.e. your righteous holy heavenly father.
[time=1749] It's outside of God's character to give a snake. It's outside of God's character to give a scorpion. It's impossible by virtue of his character.
[time=1756] Why did then do we insist to interpret what he does in our life differently as if he had an unholy unrighteous unloving character. Well we meet the man Job verse 1.
[time=1769] There was a man in the land of us whose name was Job and that man was blameless and upright fearing God and turning away from evil.
[time=1781] Could you think of a better thing to have written on your tombstone than those descriptive terms. Here lies so and so.
[time=1788] Blameless upright fearing God and turning away from evil all the days of his life. Job is an elder status. Job is a godly man. He is a mature saint.
[time=1798] He has walked with God. His commitment is firmly placed in the person of God. There is no question about it.
[time=1805] He also happens to be very, very blessed circumstantially. Verse 2 says he has seven sons and three daughters and his possessions, 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camel, five hundred yoke of oxen, 500 female donkeys and very many servants.
[time=1822] And that man was the greatest of all men of the East. He even had a reputation as a godly man, a great man, a multi-millionaire in the verbiage of that day.
[time=1834] Now isn't that more like what we were thinking of when we thought about Christianity? Isn't that kind of what we signed up for?
[time=1841] When we committed our lives to Christ, we repented of our sin. We said, I want to be a Christian. I want to follow God. I want to be what God wants me to be. Isn't this kind of the way it was supposed to work out?
[time=1852] We would be holy. We would be righteous. We would be turning away from evil. We'd have a wonderful family. We'd have all the physical blessings that we could possibly hope for and we'd have a marvelous reputation.
[time=1862] So it was with Job. Verse 6, "Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them."
[time=1872] And the Lord said to Satan, "From where do you come?" And Satan answered the Lord and said, "From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it."
[time=1879] And the Lord said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, for there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil?"
[time=1889] Verse 9, "Satan answered the Lord. Does Job fear God for nothing? Has Thou not made a hedge about him and his house and all that he has on every side? Thou has blessed the work of his hands and his possessions have increased in the land? But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he has. He will surely cursed thee to thy face."
[time=1910] In other words, Job understands the human frame. Job understands how we, excuse me, Satan understands how we think and he is saying the only reason that Job is as faithful to you and loves you and serves you as he does is because you have given him everything he wants.
[time=1928] You have put him right in the center of his own will for his own life. Why would he do anything but love you?
[time=1936] You are the great cosmic vending machine. You give him everything he wants!
[time=1942] Verse 12, "Then the Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, all that he has is in your power. Only do not put forth your hand on him, so Satan departed from his presence."
[time=1952] The presence of the Lord. Now, verses 14 through 19 catalog the absolute destruction of Job's life. This messenger comes with him in verse 14 and says, "Your oxen, their gone, your donkeys, their gone, and all your servants with them, their gone."
[time=1966] Before that first messenger can finish speaking, another comes in verse 16 and says, "Fire of God fell from heaven and burned up your sheep and all your servants."
[time=1976] Verse 17, "While that messenger is still speaking and other comes and says the caldians have taken all your camels and all of your servants."
[time=1984] And while that third messenger is speaking, yet a fourth comes in verse 18 and says, "Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brothers' house. They were enjoying fellowship together."
[time=1996] Verse 19, "And behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell in the young people and they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you."
[time=2009] Now, what do you have here? A 45-minute conversation? Each messenger shows up, and before the one can stop talking, the other has arrived, and the other has arrived, and the other has arrived, and before they're done giving their messages.
[time=2020] The man learns that absolutely everything he owns, everything he has, by way of family, except his wife, is gone.
[time=2029] God's taken it all away. Listen to his response in verse 20.
[time=2034] Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground to worship. My. He was a plainless man. He was upright. He did fear God.
[time=2044] Verse 21, and he said, "Naked, I came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there." The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord, and now the commentary from the Word of God, verse 22, through all this, Job did not sin, nor did he blame God.
[time=2062] What a remarkable response to the sovereignty of God in his life. He says, "Look, God is sovereign. I'm not. I'm His created being. He can do anything He wants to with my life. He gave me everything I had in the first place, because I came forth naked from my mother's womb. When I die, I won't have anything anyway, and so if the Lord wants to take it away, blessed the name of the Lord."
[time=2087] That, by the way, is the right response to tragedy in our lives. The right response to a loving, sovereign God's will for our life.
[time=2097] But it goes on, chapter 2, "The sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord. Satan also came among them to present himself before the Lord."
[time=2104] Now, verse 4, "Satan answered the Lord and said, 'Skin for skin. Yes, all that a man has, he will give for his life. However, put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh. He will curse thee to thy face."
[time=2118] In other words, all you've done is taken away his physical belongings and his children, touch his actual body with sickness.
[time=2125] Verse 6, "So the Lord said to Satan, 'Behold, he is in your power. Only spare his life. He can't kill him." Verse 7, "Then Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and smoked Job with sore boils from the soul of his foot to the crown of his head."
[time=2140] We don't know medically exactly what these sore boils are, but we do know from the account here in the Word of God that they were from the bottoms of his feet to the top of his head and everywhere in between.
[time=2150] That means there was no possible position or posture that he could take, lying down, standing up, being hung from ropes. There was no way to escape the weight of his own body bearing down on these incredibly painful sore boils."
[time=2167] Absolute physical trauma. Verse 9, "His wife saw his condition and said, 'Do you still hold faster integrity? Curse God and die.'"
[time=2180] She said, "You know what? Your life is so horrible and so bad, the best thing you can do is curse God and maybe he'll smite you dead."
[time=2190] But look at verse 10, "You speak as one of the foolish women speaks. Shall we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?"
[time=2204] In all this, again, the Bible comments, "Job did not sin with his lips." It's interesting.
[time=2211] He says, "Shall we accept good from God and not accept adversity?" He doesn't say bad. He doesn't say evil. He doesn't say scorpions. He doesn't say snakes. He says, "Are we only going to accept the good and not the hard, not the difficult?"
[time=2228] So again, Job has properly responded to the sovereign will of God in his life. Job and effect has said, "There are no standards which God must meet in my life for my own personal pleasure and comfort. There is no way that my life must work out for God to be God. God is sovereign, God is loving whatever he brings into my life. I will graciously and willingly submit to it because he is God and I am not."
[time=2254] The interesting thing is though, his boils don't go away. Every day he wakes up if he can fall asleep and he still has boils all over his body.
[time=2266] And his kids don't come back to life. They're all still dead and all their wives. And all of his millions of dollars of stuff doesn't reappear.
[time=2278] In other words, God, even though Job has responded in the purity of his heart with godliness before God, God doesn't take all the pain away. He doesn't reverse the circumstance.
[time=2290] The condition of his life stays the horrible thing that it was.
[time=2295] So much so that in chapter 3, verse 1, listen to what Job says. He opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. Job said, "Let the day perish on which I was to be born and the night which set a boy is conceived," verses 10 and 11, "because it did not shut the opening of my mother's womb where I hide trouble from my eyes. Why did I not die at birth? Come forth from the womb and expire."
[time=2320] He's saying, "My land's how in the world that this continued to happen. Why was I ever born? I hate my life. It would have been better for me that I never, ever, ever existed."
[time=2335] Well, he runs into his friends. They come and they sit with him for an entire week, just because his condition is so severe, words would be inappropriate, so they just sit and mourn with him for a week.
[time=2345] Then one of them speaks up in chapter 5, verse 8, look at what he says. This is Elephaz, one of his counselors.
[time=2354] Verse 8, "But as for me, I would seek God, and I would place my cause before him."
[time=2362] And here, Elephaz puts a seed thought into the heart and mind of Job that he ought to get before God and present his case and maybe the thing could change.
[time=2373] Another of his friends shows up in chapter 8. This friend's name is Bill Dad, Elephaz and Bill Dad. Job, but I'd get some friends with better names. Maybe that's part of his problem.
[time=2388] Here's a common remark. Look at this in verses 5 and following.
[time=2393] "If you would seek God and implore the compassion of the Almighty," here it is now, verse 6, "If you are pure and upright, surely now he would rouse himself for you and restore your righteous estate, though your beginning was insignificant, yet your end will increase greatly."
[time=2411] In other words, the real problem here, Job, isn't with God, it's with you. See? You're not pure. You're not upright. You must have some uncomfessed sin in your life. You have Christians like this, who every time you go through a hard time show up and say, "Boy, been in sin lately, huh?"
[time=2426] Real encouraging. Real positive. Now of course, sometimes God disciplines us for our sin, but every time that our life goes sour, every time a hard event show up, it doesn't mean that we've been in sin.
[time=2440] Well, now we're about nine or ten chapters into the book of Job, and Job has been sitting on his boils the whole time, and Job has been hurting, and Job has been in anguish, and Job has been in pain emotionally, physically, spiritually, and Job, by the way, folks, at this point, has had enough.
[time=2459] He has had enough. Chapter 9. Now I want to track with you the demanding heart of even a mature Christian. Beneath the very thin the near of our Christianity, if God strips us of all the conditional blessings in our life, we find there this raging heart that demands that God perform.
[time=2485] Watch it develop. Verse 32. Job speaks, "For he is not a man as I am a man that I may answer him, that we may go to court together. There is no umpire between us who may lay his hand upon both of us."
[time=2502] Now the words Job is beginning to fantasize in his mind that what he really needs here is a courtroom, and in the courtroom there would sit a judge, an umpire. It wouldn't be God himself, because God is the accused. God is the one who has done the wrong here, and what we need is an opportunity that I could present my case as Job and say, "This is how I've been wrong. This is what the God of the universe has done to me."
[time=2526] And in the presence of this umpire, I could be justified. I could win the case. Look at Chapter 10. Verse 1, "I loath my own life, but I will give full vent to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my own soul. I will say to God, "Do not condemn me. Let me know why thou dost contend with me."
[time=2551] Oh, my lands. Is it right for thee, indeed, to oppress, to reject the labor of thy hands, and to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked? This is a scathing indictment of God.
[time=2565] He says, "I am full of bitterness. I am full of anger. And I'm going to vent it in this courtroom. And when I do, I'll see if you'll contend with me." Verse 3, "Is it right for you to oppress?" Talk about a loaded question.
[time=2580] Who says he was oppressed? And who is he to question God whether what God does is right or wrong? It's obvious if God is heavenly, if God is the heavenly Father, then he can only do what is right.
[time=2594] Job's pain and Job's sorrow and the duration of his trial and the demandingness of his heart is bringing Job to say and think some things that are completely out of bounds.
[time=2605] They're blasphemous. They're wicked. Verse 15, "If I am wicked, woe to me." In other words, if I deserve all this stuff, then I deserve it. Curse me. That's what woe means. But look.
[time=2622] And if I am righteous, I dare not lift up my head. I am sated with disgrace and conscience of my misery. And should my head be lifted up, thou wouldst hunt me like a lion.
[time=2636] And again, thou would show thy power against me. Now he's accusing God of being an unreasoning bully. In other words, we could show up in the courtroom. You might not even listen to me. You're bigger and you're stronger than I am. And you just beat me up.
[time=2649] Facts would have no persuasive power of on you. You're not ready to listen to reason. You're not ready to be corrected. You're just a big bully. And you would like a lion hunts its prey. Hunt me down. I'm helpless.
[time=2663] Again, he indicts God as some type of horrible omnipotent cosmic evil that is not right. We'll not listen to reason. And if he is opposed, he'll just kill whoever opposes him.
[time=2679] Come to chapter 13. Verse 3. But I would speak to the Almighty and I desire to argue with God.
[time=2699] Now down to verse 15, a most often misquoted verse, misapplied verse, verse 15, chapter 13. Though he slay me, I will hope in him and people will usually stop there and say, see what faith he had.
[time=2711] Well, finish the verse. Nevertheless, I will argue my ways before him. In other words, he is like a lion. He is bigger than I am. He is stronger than I am. And if I argue my case, he likely will slay me. But I don't care. I'd rather die trying to prove he's wrong than accept him the way he is.
[time=2728] Though he slay me, I will hope in him nevertheless. I will argue my ways before him. The anger, vengeance. He questions the character of God. He questions the righteousness of God, the acts of God, the wisdom of God.
[time=2747] Now it all comes to a crescendo in Job chapter 23. Chapter 23, verses 1 and following, then Job replied, even today my complaint is rebellion. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.
[time=2774] In other words, he's insensitive. He doesn't care. Oh, that I knew where I might find him. That I might come to his seat. I would present my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. I would learn the words which he would answer and perceive what he would say to me.
[time=2794] Would he contend with me by the greatness of his power? No, surely he would pay attention to me. There the upright, namely that's me, would reason with him and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
[time=2809] Job, Job, hang on to yourself here, pal. You're so messed up. He is actually saying, if I could just find where I could get into his presence, I know I could begin to listen to him and argue with him.
[time=2823] I'd become very persuasive and eventually I'd be able to argue my case with such convincing power that it would put off his own ability to kill me. He'd pay attention to me, verse 7, the upright, that's me. I'd reason with him and I'd finally be delivered from him who is my judge.
[time=2843] That would be my day in court. Weird things happen to people. When God allows their comfort zone to be violated for a long period of time and He gives them no answers and He gives them no help as far as their circumstances.
[time=2863] And though He begins this book as being described, blameless, upright, fearing God and turning away from evil, all God has to do is knock the props out from underneath His life as Satan accused.
[time=2873] All he has to do is rip the thinned the near of his Christianity off and Job never cursed God but He's sure God in His face and He's sure questioned His integrity and His character and all that God stood for and He accused God of doing things that were wrong.
[time=2893] Well, as you've noticed God hasn't been saying much but He's going to speak here now. Come to Job, chapter 38.
[time=2909] Chapter 38, verse 1, "Then the Lord answered Job out of the world when, could have been translated storm, you know you're in trouble when God's going to answer and He answers out of a storm."
[time=2926] I mean, that's like punctuating His feelings. Here it comes. What does He say? Verse 2, "Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?"
[time=2938] Now, gird up your loins like a man and I will ask you and you instruct me. Now, here it is, "Laced with sarcasm, listen to these questions and vision yourself, standing before God, demanding a presence with Him, demanding to plead your case because you find Him unrighteous and that He has done you wrong, answer His questions."
[time=2958] Will you? Verse 4, "Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?" Tell me if you have understanding. Who said its measurements since you know?
[time=2970] Or who's scattered or excuse me stretched the line on it? On what were its basis sunk? Or who laid its cornerstone?
[time=2978] When the morning stars sing together and all the sons of God shout out for go, that's a picture of the creation of the heavens and the earth and the angels, they're described as the sons of God, are shouting with joy at the magnificent wisdom and power of God who can create this whole thing out of nothing.
[time=2993] He says to Job, "Where were you?" Verse 8, "Who enclosed the sea with doors when bursting forth it went out from the womb who said to it in verse 11, "Thus far you shall come but no farther."
[time=3007] And here shall your proud wave stop, Job. Are you okay with this? Can you do this too? Can you say to the wave, stop right here? Can you move the Pacific Ocean 150 miles that way?
[time=3022] Or are you pretty much just upon at the hands and the power of the proud waves of the ocean?
[time=3030] Verse 12, "Have you ever in your life commanded the morning and caused the dawn to know its place?
[time=3036] What was the last time, Job? You just kind of wanted it to be daytime, so in the middle of the night you said dawn and the sun came up."
[time=3048] He goes on, verse 16, "Have you entered into the springs of the sea or have you walked in the recesses of the deep, have the gates of death been revealed to you or have you seen the gates or of deep darkness?"
[time=3063] Verse 19, "Where is the way to the dwelling of light?" That's a question. And darkness, where is its place that you may take it to its territory, that you may discern the paths to its home?
[time=3075] Yeah, we handle light, we flick a switch, it comes on, we flick a switch, it goes off. What God is saying, Job, just grab a little bit of light, just hold it in your arms and take it somewhere, put it in its home and tell it to stay there until you come back for it.
[time=3087] Do the same with darkness. And you know, for this is amazing and Job can't begin to answer these questions, but this is just absolutely mundane compared to the questions God could have asked Job about an atom or about a molecule that we now have a little more understanding into.
[time=3106] I mean, this is just basic stuff. Verse 34, "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds so that an abundance of water may cover you, can you send forth lightnings that they may go and say, 'Here we are, can you command and have lightning appear in the sky? Can you command and have it disappear? Who are you, Job? Where do you come from? Who are you?"
[time=3129] To sit in judgment of me. Well, listen to Job's answer in chapter 40.
[time=3140] Verse 40, verse 1, "Then the Lord said to Job, 'Will the fault finder contend with the Almighty? Let him reproves God, answer it.'"
[time=3150] In other words, who do you think you are? Then verse 3, Job answered the Lord and said, "Behold, I am insignificant. What can I reply to you? I lay my hand on my mouth."
[time=3165] It's like when you've said something that you wish you hadn't said, you go, "You're trying to grasp the words back, but you can't."
[time=3172] You stop speaking. Verse 5, "Once I have spoken, I will not answer, even twice I will add no more."
[time=3179] Job thinks it's enough that he just shut up, that he say, "I'm insignificant. I stop."
[time=3188] But the loving hand of God has not finished in Job's life. So verse 6, "Then the Lord answered Job out of the storm and said, 'Now gird up your loins like a man. I will ask you and you instruct me, will you really unknow my judgment? And will you condemn me that you may be justified?"
[time=3213] There it is, folks. There is the pattern of the believer who, when they do not like the way God's sovereign loving hand is leading them into the loss of a husband, the loss of a wife, the loss of a job, the loss of a reputation, the loss of whatever it is.
[time=3232] And when the severe circumstances are so hard and they toil so long on the mere human frame, eventually the human heart will strike out at God.
[time=3242] And try to unknow his judgment and condemn him that that same human heart will be justified.
[time=3250] God, you have made a mistake. You are wrong. I am right. If you would just listen, you'd learn that from me.
[time=3264] Will you really unknow my judgment? Will you condemn me that you may be justified?"
[time=3272] Well, Job's going to talk one more time in this book, come to chapter 42.
[time=3282] Then Job answered the Lord and said, "I know that thou canst do all things and that no purpose of thine can be thwarted. Here we are back to the sovereignty of God. I am fully aware that you are totally sovereign."
[time=3298] Verse 3, "Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have declared that which I did not understand things too wonderful for me which I did not know. As your finite creature, I have no ability to comprehend, understand you in totality, and therefore I have no position to sit in judgment of your behavior."
[time=3324] And what you are doing in my life. Verse 4, "Here now and I will speak. I will ask thee and do thou instruct me. There is a humble, teachable heart."
[time=3336] Verse 5, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees thee. Therefore I retract and I repent in dust and ashes."
[time=3347] Verse 5 is the most blessed verse in the whole book. You know what's going on here?
[time=3351] Verse 5, "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear. He was blameless. He was upright. He was turning away from evil. Why? Because he had been taught about God. He had heard about God. He had learned certain things about God."
[time=3366] But God loves him so much that he see his own sinfulness and that he enter into a deeper, more intimate relationship with him, that he allows Satan to destroy the externals of his life.
[time=3377] So he can come to the place of saying, "I used to hear of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you. You have acted personally and intimately in my life. You have put your finger on direct problems in my life to show me how conditional I am with you. That if you give me what I want, I love you. If you don't, I blame you."
[time=3399] Here we have a picture of a loving, intimate God that refuses to allow jurors' knowledge to be second-hand.
[time=3408] "Therefore I retract and I repent in dust. That's a happy place."
