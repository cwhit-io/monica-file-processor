[time=13] >> Well, wherever you are in that continuum of learning to share the Gospel, we are going to learn from Revelation chapter 11 from two witnesses, two true witnesses.
[time=22] And the truth, I believe we can glean from this chapter, goes above personality and culture and style and a way of sharing the faith.
[time=30] And I hope we can draw some, well, some transcendent principles about evangelism and being a true witness for the cause of Christ.
[time=38] [MUSIC]
[time=52] >> Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=60] Thank you for joining us.
[time=62] How effective is your witness for Christ?
[time=64] What are the factors that make for an effective witness?
[time=68] Stay with us this morning as Pastor Moore gives us the four marks of a true witness.
[time=74] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available.
[time=77] Pastor Moore will be speaking from the Book of Revelations, chapter 11.
[time=83] Our special music today will be provided by Peter Coby and Susan Stum.
[time=91] [MUSIC]
[time=95] Let's now join our sanctuary choir and orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=100] [MUSIC - 176 seconds]
[time=286] [APPLAUSE]
[time=290] [MUSIC - 198 seconds]
[time=498] I know I'm feeling the kind of the uplifting spirit of spring and summer as the weather warms up and as the sun comes out on a more regular basis, you can almost forget how much you enjoy the sun and all of God's creation.
[time=511] And it's just another way that we can give glory and honor to our great and awesome creator.
[time=516] Well today in our study of the Book of Revelation we're going to look at the two faithful witnesses of Revelation chapter 11 and draw from that passage specific truths about or marks of a faithful witness.
[time=529] And I was thinking about that and I'm so encouraged that we're even sending some witnesses to Russia.
[time=535] Our church is sending over three men on a short term basis just a couple of weeks really and they'll be traveling in and through Russia at the direction of Send International.
[time=545] That's a very strong evangelical mission agency that's being used greatly of God in Russia as of late.
[time=552] And we'll be going our men will be going with them to Russia and they'll be reviewing the work of many many different Christian churches there in several different parts of Russia.
[time=563] And our objective in sending our three men there is that they'll come home and give us a report of the ways in which we might be useful to those churches.
[time=572] And I know it's our heart at Black Hawk Baptist Church and also through the Bible Hour and maybe we'll invite you to be a part of something where we can support some of the work that Christ is doing in the former Soviet Union.
[time=585] And what a remarkable outpouring of the Spirit of God this has been in the last several years as the gospel has been given free proclamation to a people here to for have been rejected that truth.
[time=596] And I know you're excited about that and I would invite you to pray for the people of Russia and for even our men as they go these next two weeks that God will guide and lead and direct them to bring home to us the ways that we can be of help and assistance.
[time=612] We're also thankful for our own country, the United States of America and what a blessing it's been to live here in the United States and to know the freedom economically and politically and religiously that we so much enjoy.
[time=625] And as you know, Fourth of July is coming up and we're always anxious to celebrate that and to praise God for the privilege of being Americans and to enjoy the kind of freedom that we have.
[time=635] We call it our patriotic panorama. If you've never been to a patriotic panorama, we just love for you to come. We give you an invitation. It'll be June 27th at 4 o'clock. That's a Sunday afternoon right here in our sanctuary at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=649] Pastor Peter Coby, our music director and the 175 voice choir of our church are planning a special celebration. They'll be singing patriotic songs as well as songs about Christ and the liberty we have in him, the freedom from sin and from the domination of Satan.
[time=667] It's going to be a great day, a great day of celebrating our freedoms both as a country and as citizens of heaven.
[time=673] And again, we want to invite you to be a part of that. June 27th at 4 o'clock right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church. Bring your family, bring some friends and allow us to encourage you and stimulate you in your celebration of our wonderful country.
[time=687] Also, as summer is coming, that will be an extra opportunity to spend time with our children and even our grandchildren. We're making a special offer to you through the Bible hour for your summer months. It's the Bible character cards.
[time=701] And each of these cards has the face or the picture of a famous Bible character. And then on the back of the car, there's a brief description of their life that highlights some of the accomplishments that they've made to the Kingdom of God.
[time=714] Also, on the back of the car, there's a Bible verse that comes from their life and it would be a tremendous tool to help your children learn and remember the things of God through these Bible character cards.
[time=727] So, write us if you'd like a set of these. Write us at the Bible hour, 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wind Indiana, 46815. That's the Bible hour, 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wind Indiana, 46815. And we'd love to send you your own set of these Bible character cards.
[time=751] Well, we go back now to the regular portion of our service. And again, I'll just encourage you to evaluate your own witness by the testimony of these two witnesses in Revelation chapter 11, and we'll find encouragement and strength from God's Word.
[time=781] I can write the morning winds and you are there.
[time=805] I can't say all the whitest seas and you are there. I can't find the darkest light and you are there.
[time=824] I can never be lost from you.
[time=836] The decisions rise that must be made. I compromise so debts are paid. It's all too much. I couldn't cope, but with your touch I find you home.
[time=856] I can't write the morning winds and you are there. I can't say all the whitest seas and you are there.
[time=872] I can't find the darkest light and you are there. I can never be lost from you.
[time=896] Please search me now in all my heart. Then show me how to do my part to walk the way you'd have me go.
[time=910] And if I stray, Lord, still I know. I can't write the morning winds and you are there. I can't say all the whitest seas and you are there.
[time=936] I can't write the darkest light and you are there. I can never be lost from you.
[time=962] I can never be lost from you.
[time=988] Thank you, Susan and Scott. Wonderful truth about an omnipotent omnipresent God who will never ever allow us out of his presence.
[time=1001] I'm sure that the people who will be living on the earth during the portion of Scripture we are studying here in the Great Tribulation will cling with a great tenacity to that truth as their world falls apart.
[time=1014] If you will this morning, take your Bibles and come to the book of Revelation. We're studying this book chapter by chapter and we come to chapter 11 this morning and the account of two witnesses to people that God uses in a marvelous, miraculous way to bring a clear testimony to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1037] As we set our minds to think about that, I was thinking back on my own experience in witnessing and I guess I have a lingering sense of disappointment or embarrassment even this morning as I think back on the fact that I had graduated from seminary and I've been on staff at this church, Grace Community Church for some five or six years.
[time=1059] And I was given the assignment to lead a group of college students to New York City to give leadership to a bunch of high school students who would also come to New York City and we would witness.
[time=1071] We would tell people about Christ and it was the end of the refurbishing of the Statue of Liberty and it was the great Fourth of July there. You may remember that and people were flocking to the City of New York and we were going to lead an evangelistic campaign there.
[time=1083] We were going to do that through a man by the name of Tom Mejeras. And Tom is a pastor still in New York City. He grew up in New York City. His parents were immigrants there and he just kind of ran around the streets and the ghettos of New York City didn't know Christ became a drug addict.
[time=1101] He was a very talented musician and singer and had his own rock band and he was just kind of doing his thing at his own level there in the City of New York.
[time=1111] Yet life was empty and he overdosed on drugs and almost lost his life, did it again, almost lost his life until finally somebody said, would you ever be willing to go to Scroon Lake?
[time=1123] Actually, word of life in upstate New York and he went there and he tells this story, it's absolutely hilarious. It was his first morning there. He'd kind of come at night and it's a lake and an island on a lake is where this camp is and so once they get the kids on there they can't get off.
[time=1141] And he was sitting there in the morning fog on this lake sitting on a rock, thinking about his life and how it almost killed himself and what was he going to do and who was he and where he was going to go.
[time=1151] And he looked over to his side and they're walking down the beach. Out of the fog was this man with white hair and a big white beard.
[time=1161] Tom really thought it was God. He thought, you know, quite a camp God is the speaker. And this man was Jack Wurtson and he told him about Christ and Thomas Harris came to Christ that we can return to New York City and started telling everybody about Christ that he could find and actually told so many people and so many people came to Christ, they started a church and today it's a church of some 1200 people with their own private Christian school.
[time=1187] It's kind of a beach head for Christ right there in Manhattan. We were going to do our evangelistic outreach at his invitation and through him and I was doing a preliminary visit to set this trip up and I think Tom being a wise mature pastor sensed very quickly that he was dealing with a rookie when it came to evangelism and that was really true.
[time=1206] I never let anybody to Christ personally in any other way than maybe just a friend that I had had coincidentally they came to Christ. I'd never gone out and pursued people with I want to tell you about Jesus.
[time=1218] And so as he showed me the sites, the Statue of Liberty and Wall Street and all the places, you know, Times Square, Madison Square Garden, all the hot places that we were going to take our kids as they came to visit that summer.
[time=1230] He began a share of Christ with everybody he saw. He'd tell people on the taxi, he'd tell people on the street, he'd tell people in the building, he'd tell people at the restaurant. It was absolutely amazing. You know, he could walk by a homeless person and just engage them in conversation and tell them all about his own life and his own sin and his own pride and how Christ forgave him and transformed his life.
[time=1250] The guy's kind of sitting there going, "Man, I need that." And some guys would pray to receive Christ and some wouldn't. About three or four days into this, I think it started to happen to me exactly what he wanted to happen to me.
[time=1262] I started to walk a little bit in front of him because I wanted to tell people my story and how Christ saved me and the transforming power in my life that God had brought.
[time=1272] He kind of lagged behind and sure enough before I knew it, I was witnessing and that's kind of where I learned to witness to people that I didn't already know.
[time=1281] And I'm thankful for that. I'm thankful for the power of his testimony. People say that the witnessing skill is better caught than taught and that may be true.
[time=1290] And I don't know if you learned how to witness from somebody like Tom Maharest or whether it was your parents or whether it was EE and ministry, very effective in teaching people how to witness or maybe you're like I was and you've never learned.
[time=1302] You to this day feel very uncomfortable and have never done that and maybe something inside of you says I wish I could.
[time=1311] Well, Revelation Chapter 11 is about two witnesses and they're not going to give us strategy as much in witnessing but they're going to give us kind of transcendent truths about being an effective and a true witness.
[time=1323] They're going to go beyond culture and they're going to go beyond personal style and they're going to go beyond personal circumstances and any given place at any given time.
[time=1331] And I think we're going to draw from their lives and from the teaching about them for marks, if you will, of an effective witness and you can measure your own witness by them and by their testimony.
[time=1344] So four marks of an effective witness, the first begins in verse three. It says there I will grant authority to my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1260 days clothed in sack cloth.
[time=1360] These 1260 days or three and a half years are the last three and a half years of the seven year tribulation. This is a very difficult time. The world is falling apart as you know if you've been with us in this study.
[time=1373] And God is bringing with His escalating evidence of judgment, God is bringing an escalating witness to the truth about Christ and about the gospel. And it began back in chapter seven with 144 witnesses who were sealed. They were given divine protection from the calamity that was going on in the world and the catastrophes that were occurring.
[time=1392] And they were sharing their faith and you remember also in Revelation chapter seven a great multitude of Gentiles, myriad upon myriad of Gentiles were coming to Christ. And it was the greatest revival in the history of the world. They were coming out of every people nation and tongue and tribe.
[time=1408] And so with this ascending level of judgment is coming and ascending level of light and we'll get there soon but in Revelation 146 there's an angel that's flying in the heavens and he is proclaiming an eternal gospel. This is an evangelistic blimp if you will and it goes across all the barriers of land and he just yells to people on the earth the gospel that they could come to Christ.
[time=1431] Well another incredible witness to the gospel and to Christ in this period of time are these two witnesses. And the first mark of their witness is they have a message of repentance.
[time=1445] A true witness has a message of repentance and you say how can you say that the word repentance doesn't occur in this chapter. It certainly doesn't occur in verse three. All it says there is that you'll grant the authority to prophesy and that they'll be clothed in sack cloth.
[time=1461] And if you know anything about the Old Testament and as you know much of the book of Revelation is drawn from and out of the Old Testament. It's kind of like an inside joke with your friends and it's funny to you because you knew about it and you were there when it happened and a lot of the readers here are Jewish and they have studied the Old Testament inside and out.
[time=1479] And when they hear of a preacher coming in sack cloth they instantly think that guy is coming to preach repentance because if you were to go back into the Old Testament you would find that it was the job of some prophets to come and tell the people of their sin, tell the people of the corresponding judgment of God and that they need to repent and then tell them if you will repent God will forgive you, God will give you grace.
[time=1502] And more often than not they came in that message of repentance wearing sack cloth. It's kind of like the stuff we carry our potatoes in, it's some burlap, it's rough, it's coarse, it's very drab when it comes to appearance as far as a tire would be concerned.
[time=1519] There was a message of repentance, in fact so strong was it that they were tormenting the people with it. Look at verse 10 and we're jumping ahead a little bit, these witnesses are eventually martyred and those who dwell in the earth will rejoice over them and make Mary and they will send gifts to one another because these two prophets tormented them who dwell in the earth and as you'll see in a minute they tormented them with their ability to do miracles but the main torment was their message of repentance.
[time=1548] There are confrontational message that you are in sin, you're going to experience the judgment of God if you don't repent and if you do repent God will forgive you.
[time=1558] And you are thinking to yourself, well that's okay, I mean for the Old Testament, I understand you know God did a lot of strange things in the Old Testament and he was a fierce and wrathful God in the Old Testament and I can understand why repentance would be a message for the apocalypse for the last seven years of world history that is prior to the Millennium.
[time=1577] I mean that's okay for the Old Testament, that's okay for the apocalypse but you're not suggesting are you that we who live in the age of grace, that we who are a part of the New Testament church would bring a message of repentance, isn't ours a message of love and of grace and of mercy?
[time=1595] Well that's a good question, if you'll turn with me to just four passages, if you'll hang on Revelation chapter 11, put your finger there, come with me to Matthew for a minute, Matthew chapter three and we'll try to answer that question.
[time=1607] Is a call to repentance, to turn from sin aware of the judgment of God to receive forgiveness, is that a message that should mark us?
[time=1617] Should that mark the New Testament church, you remember John the Baptist, he was kind of the prophet that stood between the Old and the New Testament, he was a little bit old and a little bit of new, he was the four runner of Christ, it says in Matthew chapter three verse one.
[time=1630] Now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[time=1640] Well that was his message, what about the message of Christ, come to Matthew chapter four verse 17, Matthew four 17 says from that time, namely from the time Christ entered his public ministry, the three and a half years of public ministry.
[time=1658] From that time Jesus began to preach, what did he say, repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[time=1667] If you turn with me to the book of Acts for a minute and Acts in the New Testament is the book all about the beginning of the church, after Christ was crucified and before he ascended he instructed his disciples to wait there until they were given the Holy Spirit and that really marked the day of Pentecost and the beginning of the New Testament church.
[time=1686] You say what about that is the message of the New Testament church, that of repentance, look at Acts chapter two verse 38 that's stunning message that was given by Peter on the day of Pentecost, he is there found saying and Peter said to them repent and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[time=1710] Now baptism as you know that's a public statement of repentance. Peter says you're not only supposed to repent of your sins but you're supposed to do it publicly, where all your friends will see, where all your people will know it's not some private little decision in your heart OG, I'm sorry for my sins I repent.
[time=1725] It's such a change of mind and heart that you're willing to publicly stand before people and say I repent, I was a sinner, I was justly given the judgment of God but by his grace I have been forgiven and Christ.
[time=1737] You say well how direct was he about their sin, look up at verse 36, he's preaching to a largely Jewish audience therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him namely Jesus Christ.
[time=1753] What is he, both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified, that's pretty confrontational, that's called calling for repentance.
[time=1765] That's called being in and amongst the people who were the very ones that crucified the living Lord of the universe and saying to them you're the one that did it.
[time=1775] And let me tell you who he is, he is Lord and he is Christ. Now if you like to repent of your sin and find forgiveness we can do that in Christ.
[time=1786] One more passage about preaching repentance come to Acts chapter 26, Acts chapter 26 verse 20.
[time=1799] And now you're going to hear from the ministry of Paul and Paul as many of you know was the greatest evangelist and the New Testament, he was the great missionary, he was the witness that God used to take the gospel to the Gentiles.
[time=1812] phenomenally successful ministry, he is now on trial for his life, what he says can and was used against him, he isn't a court of law, it eventually brought his own death.
[time=1824] Verse 19, consequently he stands before King Agrippa. I did not prove disobedient to the heavenly vision, in other words I did exactly what God told me to do, what was that?
[time=1833] Verse 20, I kept declaring both to those of Damascus first and also at Jerusalem and then throughout all the region of Judea and even to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God performing deeds appropriate to repentance.
[time=1849] So now we learn that not only are we to preach repentance and that people when they repent should stand publicly and say I repent, but that the rest of their life should show the deeds of repentance, performing deeds appropriate to repentance.
[time=1865] In other words repentance means to think the opposite way, it's a 180 degree change in your thought and I used to think this way about God and about me and about my sin and about life and now I think 180 degrees opposite, I think that I am a sinner, that God is holy, that I am a judgement, worthy of judgment and that Christ saved me.
[time=1883] So I changed my thinking, that's repentance, then I say that I changed my thinking in public, in baptism, and then the rest of my life I live repentance, I perform deeds appropriate to repentance.
[time=1895] My mind has been so completely changed that my life shows it, repentance, back to Revelation 11.
[time=1904] In the 70s there was an evangelistic tool that came out, many of you used it, I was aware of its use, though not using it at that time because I wasn't saved, I wasn't evangelizing anybody.
[time=1917] And the men who invented it and the men who used it are godly men and they have been used of God and many people have come to Christ through it and buy it.
[time=1925] It was this little phrase as you come up to someone and you've never met them before after introducing yourself, you were supposed to say, "Did you know that God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life?"
[time=1937] Well could you imagine these two witnesses coming up to people in the great tribulation and saying, "Hi, I'm one of the two witnesses. God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life."
[time=1947] To which the person responds and says, "Oh really, what is it?" So the prophet says, "Well, we've already been through the seven seals and the six trumpets. Let me show you the seven bowls of judgment."
[time=1955] Because that's God's plan for your life right now. God is in the process of bringing judgment on you.
[time=1962] In other words, the message might be God loves you and he has provided for your sin, he has provided for your direct violation of his person and his law.
[time=1973] And in fact right now, his plan for your life is hell.
[time=1979] But if you repent and if you acknowledge him as Savior and Lord, God's plan for your life is heaven. You understand the difference.
[time=1989] Now I'm not saying that we're supposed to go up to everybody we meet or don't meet. I mean, just people on the street and grab them by the lapels, drag them within six inches of our face with our blood vessels popping out and say, "You know what? You're in sin."
[time=2002] And you need to repent and you're going to have judgment. Of course not. Of course not.
[time=2009] In the course of our life as being limsical because of the transforming love of Christ in our life, we will find opportunity to share with people about Christ.
[time=2022] Let me just say this though. If our sharing, if our inviting people to Christ does not include the message of repentance, we are not a true and faithful witness.
[time=2037] If our sharing Christ with people does not include some understanding and explanation that they are sinful and that they stand in judgment, the judgment of God,
[time=2047] and that they need to turn categorically and completely away from that way of thinking and away from that lifestyle, then we are cutting our own new path in the notion of witnessing.
[time=2061] We would be out of line with the Old Testament. We would be out of line with John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus Christ, Peter and Paul, and the mandate of the New Testament.
[time=2073] So as we find ways, whimsically and powerfully and compellingly, in the context of relationship to witness, we must remember we are under mandate that a true witness brings the message of repentance.
[time=2090] Principle number two. The true witness is marked unmistakably by the power of God, by the power of the Holy Spirit working in and through Him, verses 4 through 6.
[time=2102] Look at it there. There are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands to stand before the Lord of the earth, and I'll explain that in a minute, that's kind of confusing.
[time=2110] And if anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. You've heard of morning breath. That's it.
[time=2122] They didn't teach me that in seminary. I wonder why not. And if anyone would desire to harm them in this manner, he must be killed. Verse 6.
[time=2133] These have the power to shut up the sky in order that the rain may not fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth, and every plague as often as they desire.
[time=2145] These are men whose life and whose ministry is uniquely marked by the power of the Spirit of God. You'll notice first, verse 4, which demands some explanation.
[time=2155] Why is he calling these two witnesses, two olive trees, and two lamp stands, who are standing before the Lord of the earth?
[time=2162] And again, if you knew the Old Testament, maybe some of you grew up in the church, and you know that if you didn't grow up in the church, I'll try to give you a brief explanation.
[time=2169] A Jew would instantly understand this to Zechariah 4. The two that are being mentioned in Zechariah 4 are Joshua, not the military leader, but the high priest, and Zerubbable, the king.
[time=2181] And these men were an exile in Babylon. And the people of the nation of Israel had been deported from the land, and their land had been destroyed.
[time=2189] And it was now the responsibility and the privilege of Zerubbable and Joshua the high priest to come back with a contingent of Israelites to the Promised Land and rebuild the temple.
[time=2199] And it was going to be a marvelous testimony to the power of God. It was going to be a light and a witness. And so the vision here of olive trees providing the fuel, the olive oil, for the lamp stand to illumine to the glory of God.
[time=2214] And what is so poignantly stated in that passage is that the power there is not the power of these men to do this work. It is not that they are the power, it is the Holy Spirit who is the power.
[time=2226] And so you remember the familiar verse, Zechariah 4.6, then he answered and said to me, "This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbable," saying, "Here it is, not by might nor by power, but by my spirit," says the Lord of hosts.
[time=2241] So there is an Old Testament reference to the fact that if we're going to be witnesses to God, if we're really going to be used to bring light into a dark world that will be because the Spirit of God is empowering us.
[time=2252] So verse 4, now I hope clear, these are the two olive trees, the two lamp stands at stand before the Lord of the earth. It's a colorful way of saying these men will be blessed by the power of the Spirit of God, and therefore they will illumine the gospel in the end of the age.
[time=2268] That illumining comes in four different ways. First, there is this power of fire that comes out of their mouth. I think it's interesting to note, it says in verse 5, "And if anyone desires to harm them," I mean, all you got to do is think it and you're in trouble with these guys.
[time=2282] You don't have to pick up a gun, you don't have to pick up a knife, you don't have to pick up a rope to lynch them. All you got to do is have the desire in your heart, and apparently they can sense that and fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours whoever was thinking it.
[time=2295] This is pretty hard stuff. And then it says, "They have the power to shut up the sky in verse 6 in order that the rain may not fall." Two witnesses, they're able to do these things.
[time=2310] And again, if you're familiar with the Old Testament, there's a guy in the Old Testament that did both of these. His name was Elijah.
[time=2317] Elijah had the power to stop the rain, to create a drought. In fact, he did that. King Ahab and Jezebel, she was a foreign woman and she made him worship false gods or she influenced him and he's responsible for leading the nation in false god worship. The worship of Bale.
[time=2333] And Elijah had the uninviable task of trying to turn them back from that sin and they absolutely refused to do that. And so he pronounced a drought. And James 5/17 tells us it lasts for three and a half years.
[time=2346] And as that was coming to an end, he called the people of Israel up to Mount Carmel, 1st King 17 and 18. And the prophets of Bale were there and Bale was the god of fire. And he said, "Let's prove this day who is the true and living God."
[time=2361] It says, "You build your altar, you prophets of Bale, all 400 of you and you sacrifice your animal. All build mine, all sacrifice my animal. You guys go first. If your god is the god of fire, then you do what you do and he'll burn that thing up."
[time=2372] I mean, he'll burn, he'll, there'll be a fire inside your altar and that animal will be properly sacrificed.
[time=2377] Well, you know what happened? They did their deal, they ran, they danced, they cut themselves, flagulating, doing all kinds of weird things. And nothing all day long, they finally wore out and got tired.
[time=2387] Elijah kind of walks up there with a real humble heart, I would think, and a real confidence in his god and he calls upon the god of heaven and says, "Hey, make it real clear for everybody here today. Who is the true and living God?"
[time=2398] And all of a sudden, right out of the heavens, not just fire to burn the sacrifice, it burnt the sacrifice, it burnt the sticks, it burnt the stones, it burnt the trench, it burnt the water, it burnt the land, it says the fire just licked it up, it was gone.
[time=2411] Awesome. Those are the marks of Elijah. He could bring drought and he could bring fire.
[time=2417] Apparently this guy can do, one of these guys can kind of do the same thing and then it says in verse 6, "They have power over the water to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague."
[time=2426] And if you know the Old Testament, you think that's Moses. Moses was the guy who said about the Nile River, you're going to turn into blood and it did and all the other water in the land of Egypt. He turned it to blood.
[time=2436] And Moses is the guy, they're an Exodus chapter 7 through 10, who was able to bring plagues upon the earth. All kinds of different plagues.
[time=2444] And so commentators throughout the years have said, "Oh, you know who this is, this is Elijah and this is Moses." And they're going to come back at the end of the world.
[time=2452] And they're going to do all this great stuff. And you know what, actually we don't know who this is going to be. It might be Moses. It might be Elijah.
[time=2460] Did you know that they never found the body? The Bible says they never found the body of Moses. He died. They never found his body.
[time=2466] And remember about Elijah? He never did die. He went to heaven in a chariot.
[time=2470] And you remember Matthew chapter 17, the amount of transfiguration Jesus pulls back as humanity and outcomes the glory of God?
[time=2476] Peter says, "Let's build some booths here. This is a great place to be." Who was standing there with Jesus? Moses and Elijah?
[time=2483] So maybe it's Moses and Elijah. Maybe it's just two contemporary men who have a ministry like Moses and Elijah.
[time=2491] We can't be definitive. We can't be dogmatic.
[time=2493] I kind of like to think about it though, as if it were Moses and Elijah. Can't you see these guys?
[time=2498] Whether it in experience, they've been in the presence of God for thousands of years now. They come back to planet earth and they're looking around going, "Man, this place need help." You know, this place is bad.
[time=2508] You people have really messed this planet up. And people are looking at them. They're dressed in sack cloth, but they're these spiritual giants.
[time=2517] You know, it'd be kind of like sending George Washington and Abraham Lincoln back to Washington and say, "Hey boys, clean the place up."
[time=2524] You go, "Go get them, George. Bring all that experience. Don't be affected by contemporary thought. Just stand for the Constitution."
[time=2533] Well, we don't know. It might be these two guys. It might not be, but they will be characteristic of their ministry will be the marks of Elijah and of Moses.
[time=2544] It will be a great and spectacular day. They will preach and preach long and preach hard. And they will interpret the events of the time.
[time=2553] Their ministry will be marked by the power of the Holy Spirit. You see, well, that's great for them.
[time=2558] Is my ministry supposed to be marked by the power of the Holy Spirit? Well, just come to one other passage if you would hold it in Revelation 11.
[time=2566] And come to 1 Thessalonians chapter 1 for a minute. I want to show you an exciting verse about the power of the Spirit of God in our ministry.
[time=2576] 1 Thessalonians 1, chapter 5 says this, "For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit."
[time=2585] And with full conviction, just as you know what kind of men we prove to be among you for your sake.
[time=2591] Paul was saying, "When I came and ministered at the little church in Thessaloniki, I came in the power of the Holy Spirit. More was going on there than just me."
[time=2601] That's true of these prophets in Revelation 11. There's a whole bunch going on inside of them besides just themselves.
[time=2609] Now, I could take you. We don't have time this morning. I could take you to a number of different New Testament passages which clearly define the fact that unless the Spirit of God ministers in and through us, we are speaking but mere empty words when we articulate the gospel.
[time=2624] We are effective in evangelism only if the Spirit of God comes in full power and conviction.
[time=2632] And so that would indeed be a mark of our ministry as well or should be.
[time=2635] Then you've seen that in your own life back to Revelation 11. You've said the same words with the same heart of compassion and the same desire to bring people to Christ.
[time=2643] And that situation fell on deaf ears. They're blind to the gospel. They're a heart of heart. And you think about yourself, man, that was just horrible. That person didn't even contemplate the claims of Christ.
[time=2655] You go to another person over here. You say the exact same words. You've got the exact same heart. You want to see that person come to Christ and all of a sudden bells and whistles are going on. Lights are coming on. And the guy accepts Christ.
[time=2665] What's the difference? Spirit of God. Spirit of God working in that guy's heart and not working in that guy's heart.
[time=2672] So the witness is clearly to be given with an understanding of our dependence upon the power of the Spirit of God.
[time=2679] Point number three, or mark number three of an effective witness. Number one, he brings a message of repentance.
[time=2684] Number two, he's marked by the power of the Spirit of God. Number three, and I like this one, he has a lifelong commitment to the gospel.
[time=2693] A lifelong commitment to the gospel. Look at verses seven and following. And when they had finished their testimony, the beast, that by the way is the antichrist. And we'll talk about him when we get to Revelation chapter 13.
[time=2707] The beast that comes up out of the abyss, we've talked about the abyss already. It's a holding tank for demons until God lets them out.
[time=2715] This beast will come up out of the abyss and he'll make war with the two witnesses. And overcome them and he'll kill them. And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city which mystically is called Sodom and Egypt. And it's still a mystery. We don't know why it's called that.
[time=2730] We're also their Lord was crucified. So that tells you it's Jerusalem. And those from the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days and will not permit their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb. They'll desecrate the bodies.
[time=2744] Leave them there for that period of time. And those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, make Mary. They will sin gifts. Why? Because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
[time=2759] The phrase is interesting there at the beginning of verse 7 and when they have finished their testimony. There is then an appointed period of time for these two people to bring witness to Christ. It was for them three and a half years.
[time=2773] I believe with all my heart based on Old Testament scriptures in the Psalms and the Proverbs that there is an appointed number of days for your life and my life. And we think, oh the poor man, he lost his life prematurely. He was in a car accident at 32 or the poor person died of cancer at at 58 and their lifespan was cut short.
[time=2792] No, they weren't. They lived exactly as long as God has appointed them to live. They just happen to have ended their life by that tragedy. You and I are on this planet for the number of days that God says so. And nothing intervenes with that. Nothing changes that. We are as sovereignly protected as these two witnesses.
[time=2812] We don't know the duration of our life yet. We'll know that later, obviously, but we are as sovereignly protected. We are as cared for.
[time=2822] What I find interesting here is that these people are having a veritable party. Their ministry was across the entire world because every people tribe tongue and nation is celebrating their death and they turn it into what some have called the devil's Christmas.
[time=2837] They are literally celebrating the death of these people. They are celebrating on righteousness and it's rain on earth and they are celebrating air. The falsehoods that they continue to believe about the end of the age.
[time=2849] And so it is a wicked day. It is a wicked generation. You see, am I supposed to have a lifelong commitment to the gospel?
[time=2859] Yes. Absolutely. Of course, Christ's commitment to call people to repentance brought his life to an end. It was the apostles' commitment to call people to repentance that brought their life to an end all within the appointed period of time.
[time=2875] But it was because of the agitating nature of their ministry that provoked those people. Why should we be any different throughout the centuries?
[time=2883] We have had martyrs who have stood for the gospel at the sake of their own life. And I guess for us, for those of us who live in America today, the real challenge isn't the die for Christ, it's the live for Christ.
[time=2895] I mean, we're supposed to be a living sacrifice. That may be more difficult than a dying sacrifice.
[time=2901] It's hard to continue to live for Christ day after day after day after day and keep your heart hot and continue to evangelize and continue to see your primary role here on earth as being a witness to the glory and the gospel of Christ.
[time=2914] All the materialism, all the pleasure, all the instant gratification, all that stuff, which some of that in and of itself isn't necessarily wrong, but we can set our heart on that and we have difficulty being a living witness for Christ.
[time=2927] Remember some five or six years ago when the Soviet Union first loosened its iron clad grip on its citizens and allowed some of them out for furlough or for some limited period of time.
[time=2938] A man by the name of Georgi Vens, maybe you've read about him or seen him. I met him. He came to the church. I was involved with at that time. He was talking to our pastoral staff and he was telling us all about what it meant to be a pastor in the Soviet Union and the sacrifice and the imprisonment and the starvation and all the conditions that they lived through.
[time=2956] Separation from family and friends and he got to the end of that and we were like in our hearts feeling so unworthy to be in the ministry because all he had had to go through.
[time=2966] And then he looked at us and he says, you know, but we pray for you pastors here in America because we believe you have the harder job because you have to try to stand for Christ amidst all the pleasure and the materialism of your age.
[time=2985] Your enemy is much more subtle, ours is black and white and that kind of took us back, made us, you know, look inventory times they boy how much have I been subtly taken in.
[time=2998] You know what I think it's harder to live for Christ than it is to die for Christ. And there's nothing on our immediate horizon here in the United States of America which would suggest that we would actually have to die for our faith. That may not be our challenge.
[time=3010] Our challenge will be to live for him with the same dedication and zeal and the fire that would be on a heart that would be on fire as if we were being persecuted for our life.
[time=3022] That's our challenge.
[time=3025] So the marks of a true witness number one has a message of repentance is marked by the power of the spirit of God has a lifelong commitment in this last one has the hope of a resurrection has the hope of a resurrection look at verses 11 through 13.
[time=3040] And after the three and a half days the breath of life from God came into them and they stood on their feet and great fear fell upon those who were beholding them.
[time=3049] And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them come up here and they went up to heaven and in the cloud and their enemies beheld them and in that hour there was a great earthquake and a tenth of the city fell and 7,000 people were killed in that earthquake and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
[time=3066] God punctuates their their resurrection with this earthquake.
[time=3072] I find it fascinating what's going on here. These prophets have been coming and they've been saying these two witnesses have been saying this is this is the end of the age.
[time=3083] You folks are under judgment you need to repent and they stand against a whole host of false prophets who are proliferating at this particular time and place.
[time=3093] And the antichrist himself is on the scene and he has worldwide dominance and influence that's hard for us to comprehend. But these two guys they show up and they say the antichrist is wrong and all the false prophets are wrong.
[time=3104] This is not the beginning of a new day the disappearance of all the church in the rapture that wasn't some alien thing that took away all the evil people so that you folks could then continue now to bring in the new era, the new way, the new life.
[time=3117] And these catastrophic events are not birth pains of a new era. This is the end of the world and it's coming because of your sin and it's God's judgment on you.
[time=3128] And they're making life very difficult for the antichrist and they're making life very difficult for these great host of false prophets.
[time=3135] So much so that it says in verse 10 they're tormenting the people with their message.
[time=3141] And it was tough to deny them because they could cause a drought or they could bring a localized plague or they could just kill people with the fire out of their mouth.
[time=3149] How do you write those people off? How do you explain them away? They're very difficult. They're very persuasive. But then finally they died.
[time=3160] You see, that's celebration time. Great. They're dead. That must mean their God is dead. And they're celebrating not just over the death of two witnesses. They're celebrating the false hope that there's a new day coming, that they're not really in trouble with a God, that they don't have to stop their sin.
[time=3179] They're celebrating this whole notion that there is no God because his witnesses are dead so he must be dead too. And God allows them to do this worldwide party for three and a half days.
[time=3193] And they're now beginning to articulate that very line of reasoning, I believe. They're saying see, there is no God. We don't have to repent because his witnesses are dead and they sing their songs and they do their thing.
[time=3205] And just when they're in the frenzy of their celebration, God raises them from the dead. It's hilarious. It's unbelievable. God is so clever. He's got them right where they want them. They're now articulating the very thing he wants them to say.
[time=3222] He must be no God because they're dead and just when they formulate the thought and articulate it with their lips and build a national, international holiday around it, he raises them from the dead.
[time=3231] And says think again. Think again. I will verify the veracity of their message not only by their fire, not only by their drought, not only by their ability to turn water into blood, not only by their ability to bring plagues but I'll verify it in front of your very eyes by my ability to raise them from the dead.
[time=3251] You don't be a mistaken world. You're in sin. This is my judgment and I've given you forgiveness in Christ. Won't you please accept it?
[time=3261] So you see the heart of God, his grace and his mercy to allow them to die and then raise them so they'll have yet another polemic, another evidence of his power and his love.
[time=3278] Well, there's a little question as we read the New Testament is there that the hope of the New Testament believer is that we too are going to raise from the dead.
[time=3286] The fact is this, folks, the reason you and I are supposed to be willing with ever increasing level of sacrifice to live for the cause of Christ and the here and now, the reason we're supposed to be willing to give up our time and our interest and our money or use all the same for the cause of Christ and to divest ourselves of our own agenda and really be committed to the gospel.
[time=3307] It's because we know that life is but a vapor and we will live here not for three and a half years but for 70 or 80 years which in the time frame of eternity is about the same amount of time and we're going to have this very brief moment of life but we're going to be resurrected.
[time=3323] We're going to come back from the dead and when we do, God's going to give us eternity and over and over and over again from the Old Testament that has been a driving theme and a passion in the hearts of those who would truly serve God.
[time=3337] I will live a sacrificial life here and now. I will be like the grain of wheat who falls in the ground and dies in my life here and now. I will be a servant. I will give my life away because I know and I believe with all my heart I'm going to be raised again.
[time=3352] And when I get raised again I'll live forever and God will fill me with his glory. God will satisfy every longing of my heart. God will meet every one of my needs forever and so for this brief time I will live for him.
[time=3370] How is your witness? How is your witness? Is your witness marked by the message of repentance? Is your witness marked by the power of the Holy Spirit? Do you have again a renewed sense of dependence upon the Spirit of God for you to be effective?
[time=3390] Are you willing to live for Christ to have a lifelong commitment to the cause of Christ and are you driven and motivated by a resurrection hope?
[time=3401] Which seems to call you to higher levels of commitment and sacrifice with the passing of each new day. For brief are the days of our life.
