[time=16] But Jesus in Matthew 24 verse 4 says this.
[time=20] Jesus answered and said to them, "See to it that no one mislead you.
[time=25] For many will come in my name saying, 'I am the Christ, and will mislead many.'"
[time=33] [MUSIC]
[time=45] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Satan has long been called the deceiver.
[time=57] He has worked through the ages to bring people to believe his lies about God and about the Word of God.
[time=63] Today in our study of Revelation, we will see his final effort to deceive the world and the devastating effect it will have on those who accept his lies as truth.
[time=74] We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available.
[time=78] Pastor Moore will be speaking from the book of Revelations, chapters 12, 13, and 14.
[time=85] Our special music today will be provided by Michelle Smekens.
[time=93] Let's now join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=99] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=105] Early in the morning, our song shall rise to be.
[time=110] Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful, and mighty.
[time=116] God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[time=121] Holy, Holy, Holy, all the saints of or thee, casting down their golden crowns around the glassy seat.
[time=132] Cherubim and seraphim, falling down before thee.
[time=138] Who word and art and evermore shall be?
[time=143] Holy, Holy, Holy, Thou the darkness, Heidi.
[time=149] Thou the eye of a sinful man, thy glory may not see.
[time=154] Only Thou art holy.
[time=157] There is man beside thee, a perfecting power in love and purity.
[time=165] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=170] All thy works shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[time=177] Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful and mighty.
[time=182] God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[time=192] Holy, Holy, Holy, Amen.
[time=203] As God walked with his creation, man began to know his master.
[time=208] This was a God so mysterious that he moved among worlds beyond our knowing.
[time=213] So mighty that he spoke with thunder, so gentle that he breathed the evening breeze.
[time=219] So wise that he understood tomorrow, so wonderful that he walked and talked with man.
[time=227] In those first cool evenings in the garden, God opened his heart to his creation, and man
[time=233] came to know him by one word, holy.
[time=249] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.
[time=261] Early in the morning, what sunshine brights to me.
[time=273] Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful and mighty.
[time=285] All in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[time=305] Holy, Holy, Holy.
[time=311] All the saints of God Almighty, casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea.
[time=327] Thereof the Mansour of Him, falling down before thee.
[time=338] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, O the darkness high.
[time=368] Holy, I have sinned for them by glory in the sea.
[time=412] Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, of thy worship, praise thy name.
[time=428] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful and mighty.
[time=446] All in three persons, blessed Trinity.
[time=475] Holy, Holy, Holy, O the darkness high.
[time=492] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour.
[time=500] We're so encouraged when we hear from you and through letters and even telephone calls to the church letting us know that you faithfully watched the Bible Hour.
[time=510] Last summer, I came across some Bible character cards and I thought this might just be a great way
[time=517] to spend some time with your children or grandchildren.
[time=519] So I thought if you didn't take advantage of the opportunity to get the Bible character cards,
[time=525] we'd offer them again this summer.
[time=526] They're a set of 72 cards, each one having a picture of one of the Bible characters,
[time=532] a little bit of their biography and it's an excellent way to share the different characters
[time=539] that are listed in our Bible and a little bit about their lives and how they how they represented the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=546] So you can receive these character cards by writing to the Bible Hour today at 7400 East State,
[time=553] Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=558] If you have the opportunity to write and consent us a donation, we'd appreciate it but we'll send the cards to you free if you'll just write to us and ask for the character, Bible character cards.
[time=568] It's a great way to spend a summer with your grandchildren if they come to visit you.
[time=572] We have a special event coming up, but Russell, this is the 20th year for the patriotic panorama.
[time=579] It's hard to believe that, but we have been singing songs about God in country for a number of years now.
[time=586] And, you know, we are so blessed to have something to sing about.
[time=589] I know that we come to appreciate that even more in the last many years as the former Soviet Union
[time=595] has finally given up on Communism and to think that through the centuries we have enjoyed freedom
[time=601] in this country, freedom to pursue our beliefs and in our case the cause of Christ.
[time=606] [AMEN] That special event we're calling it Reflections on America from Sea to Shining Sea
[time=614] and we'll be having that program on Sunday afternoon June 27th at 4pm.
[time=620] That's an excellent time for you to come and visit Black Hawk Baptist Church if you're not a regular attender and join with us on that special tribute to America and in particular those who have faithfully
[time=631] fought for the preservation of the United States of America. We're so excited about the program.
[time=636] We want to take just a little bit of time on our insert here to show you some of the programs of the past and give you a little bit of an idea of the music, the video and the atmosphere
[time=647] that's created during our annual patriotic panorama.
[time=670] [MUSIC]
[time=700] God bless America.
[time=710] Land that I love.
[time=716] Stabby cinder and guide her through the night with the light from above.
[time=728] From the mountains to the prairie, raise your hands wide with love.
[time=740] God bless America.
[time=746] My home sweet home.
[time=752] Well, I hope that gives you some excitement for our patriotic panorama.
[time=768] Once again, that'll be Sunday afternoon June 27th at 4pm right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=776] 7400 East State Boulevard in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=780] I hope you'll come and join with us.
[time=782] We're going back to the live portion of our service now.
[time=785] Stay tuned for more music and the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=790] [MUSIC]
[time=810] When others see with earthly eyes, just what they want to see.
[time=822] You will see the things that never die.
[time=832] You will know when bright can eyes, I simple just like faith.
[time=842] The priceless truth that others will deny.
[time=854] When others say you're just a man, you'll like to dream his dreams.
[time=864] When others call on miracle, omit.
[time=872] You'll listen for eternity.
[time=876] Omits as they pass, and see, with spirit eyes, what others miss.
[time=886] Oh, born this rock.
[time=892] I built my kingdom.
[time=896] And on this rock forever and ever it shall stand.
[time=904] And all the powers of Hell itself shall never more breathe them.
[time=910] I can't sit for Satan throughout our build.
[time=914] I think he's dead.
[time=918] Because this rock.
[time=922] I built my kingdom.
[time=926] And on this rock forever and ever it shall stand.
[time=933] I can't sit for Satan throughout our build.
[time=961] You see the sun of God.
[time=966] If you would choose to lose when you could wait.
[time=973] If you would give your life away for nothing in return.
[time=981] Then you are where my kingdom will begin.
[time=987] Oh, born this rock.
[time=992] I built my kingdom.
[time=996] And on this rock forever and ever it shall stand.
[time=1003] And all the powers of Hell itself shall never more breathe them.
[time=1009] I can't sit for Satan throughout our build.
[time=1175] I remember not too many years ago flying from one part Southern California to Northern California.
[time=1179] I was going to speak somewhere.
[time=1192] I began to find things in common with.
[time=1976] I quit, I don't give up.
[time=1977] I continue to play in the hope.
[time=2745] Now then, back to chapter 14.
[time=2747] You'll find, if you take that mark, the mark of the man to yourself,
[time=2753] that will be your entrance ticket into eternal hell.
[time=2760] Verse 9, he receives the mark on his forehead on his hand.
[time=2763] They will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which has mixed in full strength and the cup of his anger.
[time=2770] The world has never seen this before.
[time=2772] If you look at the wrath of God in other situations, even in the Old Testament, you'll find that it was mitigated in some way or in some portion in either length or severity.
[time=2782] But here comes the full strength undiluted, unmitigated wrath of God.
[time=2789] You say, what is that?
[time=2790] To be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the Lord, the Lamb.
[time=2796] And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever and ever and they will have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and the image.
[time=2805] Those who receive the mark of his name.
[time=2809] So it is a horrible, horrible lot.
[time=2812] It is the end of their life.
[time=2816] You know, when you try to get people to make good choices today, sometimes you need to show them tomorrow.
[time=2822] And the consequences of their decision.
[time=2824] There have been some great ads out on smoking that try to say, wow, it looks really popular and it looks like a lot of fun that makes you kind of feel a certain way as far as being accepted in some particular group.
[time=2835] They'll endeavor to show the end of smoking and show what happens to the human lungs and show people dying of cancer in the hospital and trying to say, hey, before you start here, look at what it brings you to.
[time=2847] Look at what it eventuates.
[time=2851] And God, I think very graciously here, shows us.
[time=2854] He cuts through the gloss of Satan's incredibly deceptive situation.
[time=2858] The people who are being deceived by Satan in this particular time.
[time=2861] They won't think they're being to save.
[time=2863] They'll be sincerely believing in the Antichrist.
[time=2866] They will sincerely be giving their allegiance to this one who they believe is attested to by signs and wonders as the one that they should worship and follow.
[time=2878] And God goes behind the scenes and tries to show them, "If you do that, if you place your confidence and your trust in him by receiving his mark, you will end up forever tormented in hell."
[time=2892] Unrelenting pain.
[time=2896] Well, there is this dark, dark picture of deception.
[time=2899] But in the midst of it, there are the undecieved.
[time=2902] And let's look at them for a minute.
[time=2904] There are four little vignettes of the undecieved.
[time=2906] It begins in chapter 12, verse 17.
[time=2910] This is the group I want to be in.
[time=2912] This is the group I'm thankful I am in.
[time=2914] And if I lived in this day, I would hope I had the courage to live in.
[time=2918] Speaking of Israel, first, chapter 12, verse 17.
[time=2923] And the dragon was enraged with the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her offspring who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus.
[time=2936] They are described here as keeping the commandments of God and holding to the testimony of Christ.
[time=2946] They are the undecieved.
[time=2949] They will not fall into the sin of the end of the age.
[time=2952] They will not deny Christ.
[time=2954] Look at chapter 13, verses 8 and 10.
[time=2960] Another little picture of the undecieved.
[time=2962] This time not the nation of Israel.
[time=2965] And all who dwell on the earth will worship him.
[time=2967] Everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain.
[time=2975] In other words, everybody accepts those whose names have been written from the foundation of the world in the Lamb's book of life will fall in this deception.
[time=2985] And there we find that the remarkable love of God that would pursue people from before the foundation of the world and put their name in the Lamb's book of life.
[time=2993] They survive this time, survive at I.E.
[time=2996] They don't fall to the deception of the dragon and his false prophet and the any Christ.
[time=3004] Look at chapter 14, verses 4 and 5, a beautiful picture of faithfulness to our Lord and the midst of all of this.
[time=3011] These are the ones speaking of the 144,000 who have not been defiled with the women, excuse me, with women, in the words they are sexually pure for they have kept themselves chaste.
[time=3023] They are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes.
[time=3026] These have been purchased from among men as first fruits to God and to the Lamb and no lie was found in their mouth.
[time=3034] That's interesting.
[time=3035] In an age of escalating deception they are absolutely full of truth and they are blameless, a word that describes maturity in their faith.
[time=3045] So these undissieved, stand undefiled, chaste, sexually pure, following the Lamb wherever he goes, without lying in their mouth and blameless in their behavior.
[time=3059] And then chapter 14, look at verses 12 and 13.
[time=3064] Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
[time=3074] I don't know if you can see it any clearer or anywhere else in the New Testament to come to Christ and to be truly born again means that you are going to keep the commandments of God.
[time=3086] If these people in this day under this kind of persecution, when they come to Christ, stay faithful to Him all the way to the end and that faithfulness is defined by their keeping the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=3103] Now, anyone can believe that you can come to Christ and live a habitually, characteristically sinful life escapes my understanding
[time=3113] because it's taught all through the New Testament and then again reinforce right here in this climactic point of world history that the true believers are marked by their perseverance and what is their perseverance, their faithful, continual, unending obedience to the commandments of God.
[time=3131] There is no such thing as a habitually, characteristically, disobedient Christian.
[time=3138] Believers faithfully follow the Word of God.
[time=3142] Yes, there may be times of struggle, yes, there may be times of disobedience, but obviously here disobedience to step on the other end of the line to step over the divider between the side of Christ and the side of Satan is to have lost your perseverance, is to have lost your ability to obey the commandments of God and therefore to reveal you were never truly saved in the first place.
[time=3165] There are only two camps, there are only two camps spiritually.
[time=3169] You're either in Satan's camp or you're in Christ's camp and those who are known to be in Christ's camp are not so because they made a profession of faith.
[time=3178] It says nowhere here that they made a profession of faith.
[time=3183] It says that they are keeping the commandments of God and their faith in Christ and we understand that a faith that is a true faith works.
[time=3192] So even as we look to the end of the age, we find those who are truly saved to evidence that salvation in their perseverance defined as their faithful obedience unto death.
[time=3205] And that is exactly what's happening to these undecieved.
[time=3208] They are obeying and for their obedience they are being killed.
[time=3214] So it's a strong encouragement, isn't it?
[time=3218] Strong encouragement.
[time=3220] As we close, let's go to Titus 3, just one more scripture.
[time=3224] Titus 3, 3.
[time=3234] And this is just a wonderful point that the Bible makes about you and me, and we should be arrogant about being the undecieved.
[time=3245] Titus 3 verse 3 says this, "For we also once were foolish, disobedient and deceived."
[time=3254] There isn't a person in this room who hasn't been deceived.
[time=3258] And I mean by that, deceived outside of Christ, unsaved, lost in our sin.
[time=3264] And though you may have come to Christ at an early age, that by the grace of God.
[time=3269] All of us were once foolish and disobedient and deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures,
[time=3276] spending our life in malice and envy and hateful, hating one another.
[time=3283] But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appear, who saved who?
[time=3290] He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness,
[time=3297] but according to His mercy by the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ.
[time=3306] That being justified by His grace, we might be made airs according to the hope of eternal life.
[time=3314] You know why we're not over here on the side of the deceived?
[time=3318] Because God chose to save us, God poured His grace and His mercy out on us through the person of Christ,
[time=3325] and instead of our in-and-life being to be bound to hell forever and ever, where the smoke of our torment would rise day after day after day after day, forever and ever.
[time=3335] It is instead the grace that has made us airs according to the hope of eternal life.
[time=3340] No merit of our own.
[time=3343] Not our own ingenuity, not our own thinking processes, but the mere grace of God spares us
[time=3349] from being lost and blinded in our sins and full deception under Satan,
[time=3355] and by the grace of God transferred out of that lost state into the light.
[time=3361] That it's our privilege now to walk in the light, to walk worthy of our calling.
[time=3366] Let's pray together.
[time=3371] Father, we're thankful as we peek behind the curtains of humanity and see the spiritual warfare that goes on.
[time=3379] We're thankful one that we see you winning.
[time=3383] We see that you are in charge, that you're in control, and that even Michael and his angels
[time=3389] are strong enough to throw the dragon and his demons out of heaven.
[time=3394] We're thankful that we see in our own lives our own sin, and our own unrighteousness, and our own need for Christ,
[time=3402] which is the greatest evidence that we're not deceived.
[time=3405] We've come to the conclusion of another Bible Hour program.
[time=3414] I hope that you were encouraged by the music from our sanctuary choir and soloist Michelle Smekens.
[time=3420] The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3424] Just before we close today, I'd like to pray this prayer, not only for those of you that might want to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior,
[time=3431] but those of you that just have a special need and you need Christ to intercede in your life right now.
[time=3436] Let's pray together.
[time=3438] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed.
[time=3446] I need you as my Savior. I ask you to come into my heart and be my Savior today.
[time=3451] And then for those that have particular needs, maybe physical hurts or emotional needs right now, we pray that you'll intercede in their lives, and you'll help them in a particular way today.
[time=3461] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3465] If you prayed the prayer with me, would you write to us and tell us the nature of your decision?
[time=3470] And when you write to us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=3479] To receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or a copy of the Bible character cards, please write to the Vidal Hour, 7400D State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=3492] To receive a cassette copy of today's message, write and request tape number 6106 or mention the message by Pastor Moran titled "The Deceiver"
[time=3503] and please close a gift of $3 to help to pray the cost of providing this tape.
[time=3523] The Vidal Hour is made possible by gifts from members of the Founders Club, a group of committed Christians who support this outreach ministry.
[time=3531] To learn how you can become a member of the Founders Club, please write to the Vidal Hour, 7400D State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
