[time=0] this is the divinely decreed wrath of God on a people who are rejecting Jesus Christ and
[time=17] choosing instead to worship Satan and worship the false prophet and worship the antichrist.
[time=33] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. It says in John chapter 3, verse 36,

[time=50] in our study of Revelation, we come to a worldwide outpouring of God's wrath on those who have rejected
[time=56] Christ. The day of grace has ended, and the day of wrath has come. We encourage you to locate your Bibles and have them available. Pastor Moore will be speaking from the book of Revelation chapters

[time=530] Thank you again for watching the Bible Hour today, I want to tell you a little bit about the
[time=536] patriotic panorama coming up. In fact, let's just get a little bit of the flavor of what takes place
[time=542] on that particular day.
[time=572] Thank you again for watching the Bible Hour today, I want to tell you a little bit about the patriotic panorama coming up.
[time=602] From home.
[time=632] On Sunday, June 27th at 4pm right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, we will present our 20th
[time=639] annual patriotic panorama. We're calling it Reflections on America from C to Shining Sea.
[time=646] What a great day as our soloists and our 150 voice choir join together to give thanks to God
[time=653] for the privilege of living in America. Once again, the patriotic panorama Reflections on America
[time=660] from C to Shining Sea Sunday, June 27th at 4pm. I hope you'll come and join with us for this spectacular event.
[time=691] Thank you again for watching the Bible Hour today, I hope you'll come and join with us for this wonderful event.
[time=917] [APPLAUSE]
[time=926] Thank you, Rachel.
[time=928] She's one of the young people that's graduating tonight from our Christian school, and she'll be greatly missed, but it's been a joy.
[time=935] Even in the short two years that I've been in this city and a part of this church to watch her grow and mature and continue to use her gifts for the glory of God.
[time=943] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come with me to Revelation chapter 15, and if you're visiting us today or have been away for a little while, we're involved in a study of the book of Revelation.
[time=957] And we come this morning to two chapters, chapter 15 and 16, that really take us to the end of the wrath of God in the tribulation.
[time=970] It says in chapter 15, verse 1, "And I saw another sign in heaven, and great and marvelous, seven angels who had seven plagues which are the last, because in them the wrath of God is finished."
[time=987] And as I was studying this this week, an image continued to come back into my mind over and over again, and it was when I would get in trouble as a kid,
[time=999] which wasn't all that unusual. I would be sent to my room by my dad for a spanking, and he would tell me to go to my room, and I would do that.
[time=1012] And then he would have to go find the instrument of love, as he called it. It was a ping pong paddle, and often that would get lost.
[time=1025] And so he would have to find it, and he would finally retrieve it from wherever it was, and then he had the unnerving habit of slapping it against his leg on his way down the hall.
[time=1041] And you know, you wince every time you hear it as he does it on the way down the hall, because you know eventually it's not going to be against his leg, and they are in a sense precursors of the wrath of my father.
[time=1054] And what you find in chapters 15 and 16 is the final culminating physical blows of God against the physical universe.
[time=1065] And it's really almost as if he's been walking down the halls, not of our house, but of time. And God has been using this instrument and slapping it against his leg, and the world has been hearing the precursors of this final judgment throughout all of time.
[time=1080] And we could go back to Egypt and see there the ten plagues and realize that God was, in a sense, warning the world of impending wrath.
[time=1092] And we could go even as recently in the book of Revelation to the seven trumpets, which really mirror a lot of the wrath that we're going to find in these seven bowls, and again God was slapping it against his thigh, and there were warning signals.
[time=1106] In Egypt it was somewhat localized, it just impacted one nation. In the trumpets it was again somewhat localized, it just impacted a third of the world.
[time=1117] But as you'll see here this morning in these seven bowls it is worldwide, and no one escapes it. No people group, no nation, there is no place that you can hide.
[time=1129] And God brings his wrath squarely upon its target. As we think about wrath this morning I want to, for a minute, speak generally first, and to remind you that there are two kinds of wrath, or two kinds of judgment that God will bring upon people.
[time=1148] The first is just a matter of cause and effect. God has built into the moral universe certain laws, and when you violate those you will affect bring the consequence of that upon yourself.
[time=1163] The principle is that you reap what you sow, and we'll try that. Thank you. And it's an unusual thing, but it's very consistent and it's very regular, and God personally may not even be involved in this cause and effect relationship.
[time=1183] I mean first think of it in the physical realm with the obvious illustration of the law of gravity. Someone once said that man can never really break the law of God. All man does is he breaks himself against the law trying to break it.
[time=1200] Let me try to make this clear. A person says I'm going to break the law of gravity, so they get up on a tall place and they jump off. Have they broken the law of gravity? No, they're now going to be broken by the law of gravity.
[time=1213] You can't, as if to break it, as if to make it null, as if to make it non-existent, as if to say I'm going to remove, I'm going to break, I'm going to shatter, I'm going to reduce the law of gravity to nothing. You can't do that. It's impossible.
[time=1224] Jump all you like and all you do is break yourself against the law itself. You can say I'm going to break the laws of the human body and I'm going to choose not to breathe for 10 minutes. I'm going to break the laws of the human body.
[time=1237] You can't. All you do is you break yourself against the laws of the human body and the need for oxygen and you die. It's very simple. It's very obvious. You just can't do that. The same is true in the moral dimension.
[time=1253] The person says, I don't like the fact that God has said I shouldn't commit adultery. So I'm going to break that law of God. Well, there's no breaking it, folks. It's just like the law of gravity. You can break yourself against it. You can commit the act. You can commit adultery and receive all of the natural consequences of it.
[time=1273] You can't remove the law that thou shalt not commit adultery. All you end up with is a broken soul and a broken heart and broken relationships and a broken character and a broken reputation.
[time=1283] You can't break the law itself. You just break yourself against it. Right? There is this law of God that we should not be angry with each other.
[time=1297] It's a harbor anger and a heart against one another and we can say, well, I don't like that law. I'm going to break that law and we can choose to harbor and fester all kinds of anger in our life against people that we don't like.
[time=1309] And in effect, have you broken that law of God? No, you haven't. It's still there. It's still wrong to be angry with people. And if you carry your anger and you don't confess your sin and you don't forgive them for what they've done, you become an incredibly bitter person and you shut yourself down from the relationships in your life and nobody wants to be around you.
[time=1326] All you do is break yourself against the moral law of God. Same thing is obviously seen, for example, Ephesians 5 says we should not be drunk with wine and people who are committed to getting drunk with wine, we call them alcoholics. Can you break the law of God? Of course not.
[time=1343] When you become an alcoholic, you destroy your life. You can't hold your job and you can't be faithful in your relationships and you can't accomplish what you could otherwise accomplish.
[time=1353] You can't nullify the law of God. It's there. All you can do is break yourself against it. And that is a form of the judgment of God.
[time=1362] And in the same sense that God isn't there pushing a person down to earth when they jump off a building. In that same way, God isn't bringing all that calamity into a person's life because they violate his moral law.
[time=1374] Those are just normal, natural consequences and the cause and effect. You reap what you sow of the moral universe. But there's a second kind of judgment, the kind that we have in these chapters today.
[time=1386] And this is not an impersonal form of judgment. This is a form of personalized wrath that God brings upon people because of their refusal of Christ.
[time=1398] It is so personal that the word used in chapter 15 verse 1 for the wrath of God is the Greek word themas. And it means rage and anger. It is an emotional word.
[time=1409] It's not describing the acts of judgment as much as it is the attitude of judgment. God is upset. God is angry. God is outraged.
[time=1421] And we move beyond the normal cause and effect of his judgment to his specific and personal acts of judgment upon people who refuse to accept Christ.
[time=1433] And you'll find, especially here at the end of his judgment as it comes to its climactic end in these seven bowls that it is traumatic and it is horrifying and it is relentless. It is unescapable and it is exacting.
[time=1448] And we think of Hebrews 1229 where God is said to be a consuming fire. And inevitably whenever this aspect of God is being discussed, we question God. Why would God do that? Or how could God allow this to occur?
[time=1465] And so again in the book of Revelation, before he unveils the disclosure of his wrath, his specific and personal anger and wrath against human beings for the rejection of Christ, he gives a prelude to it.
[time=1480] Not to defend himself but to help us understand him. And that happens in chapter 15 verses 1 through 8. It is the shortest chapter in the book of Revelation and it gives two basic reasons why the wrath of God.
[time=1492] Why the wrath of God? The first one, look at verse 2. And I saw as it were, a sea of glass mixed with fire and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his image and from the number of his name standing on the sea of glass holding harps of God.
[time=1509] And they're singing verse 3, a song, a song of Moses, the bond servant of God and the song of the Lamb saying, and then there's this marvelous song, great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty, righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the nations, who will not fear O Lord and glorify thy name, for thou art holy, for all the nations will come and worship before thee, for thy righteous acts have been revealed.
[time=1538] The first reason for the wrath of God is the character of God. The character of God demands His righteous judgment against sin. And that's difficult for us to understand.
[time=1551] It's hard for us to understand why He's going to condemn the world to this kind of severe outbreak of plagues and it's harder yet for us to understand how God will take the soul of a human being and confine it to hell forever and ever and ever and ever without any possible recourse without any way out.
[time=1574] And there are some who, when pondering that long enough, begin to try to reinterpret the Scriptures to say that there is no hell because they don't know how to take the reality of hell and bring it into concert with God and what we know about God. How could He do this?
[time=1594] Let me remind you, who is it that singing this song? Verse 2, "I saw the sea of glass mixed with fire." That's the scene there in heaven. That's the sea of glass that comes from the throne of God. It's mixed with fire to speak of His judgment. Now who's singing? And those who had come off victorious from the beast and from His image and from the number of His name, they are standing on the sea of glass and they're holding harps of gold.
[time=1615] These are people who have lived through the tribulation and who have not bowed down to worship Satan. They are, in fact, believers. And we've seen them once before in the book of Revelation. Hold your finger there at chapter 15 and come back to chapter 6. Let me remind you of these people.
[time=1630] They showed up in the fifth seal, Revelation 6.9. He broke the fifth seal. I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of God.
[time=1642] Because of the testimony which they had maintained. In other words, these are the same people. They were believers in the tribulation. They refused to compromise their testimony. They refused to compromise the word of God and they were killed for it. They are martyrs that come out of the tribulation.
[time=1655] They are underneath the altar there in the throne room of heaven. What are they doing? Verse 10.
[time=1662] They cried out with a loud voice saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, wilt thou refrain from judging and avenging our blood on those who dwell on the earth."
[time=1673] They are praying a prayer of vengeance. They are praying to the God of heaven that He will bring His mighty and fierce wrath upon those who have taken their life.
[time=1684] Here they are glorified. Now that's an interesting thought. These folks are not normal human beings.
[time=1691] They were born again while on earth. They have seen Christ face to face and they have become light Christ. They are in their glorified state.
[time=1698] That means they no longer sin. They no longer think selfish thoughts. They no longer think selfish things. All they do is they are consumed with the glory of God and what is right.
[time=1707] They have a far better knowledge and understanding of God than we do here on earth because they are glorified.
[time=1714] So we learn from them. We say, "Here are people just like us who would have had the same questions about God when He outpours his wrath."
[time=1723] But because they are now glorified and in heaven they are praying for his wrath. They are begging for it.
[time=1731] They are saying, "How long, holy and true will you refrain from judging and avenging our blood?"
[time=1739] Now look at them again. Chapter 15. Here they are again in verse 2. "I saw as it were a sea of glass that puts us back in the same basic throne room, the same place in heaven."
[time=1751] And they had come off victorious from the beast and were they standing? They are standing on the sea of glass holding harps of God.
[time=1760] They have come out from underneath the altar of God. They are no longer in a posture of prayer, besieging God to have vengeance on these wicked people.
[time=1768] They have come out from underneath there. They are standing up and they are holding harps. And harps in the Old Testament are the instrument of joy.
[time=1778] In fact, when the Israelites went into the Babylonian captivity, it says, "They hung their harps up."
[time=1784] Because there was nothing happy to sing about. They were full of sorrow. They were in captivity.
[time=1789] So the picture emerges of these same saints who were praying for vengeance. They now have seen the seven seals.
[time=1795] They have seen the seven trumpets. They know they are right on the edge of the seven bulls and they are so full of joy in their heart that they move out from underneath the altar.
[time=1803] They pick up their harps and they start to sing. What are they singing about? Well, it's the greatest compilation of the attributes of God.
[time=1814] Look at it in verse 3. Listen to their song. As they envision his wrath upon the earth, they sing your great.
[time=1821] They sing your marvelous for your works, which works, the works of wrath that you've done and that you're going to do.
[time=1827] You're Lord, you're God, you're Almighty, you are righteous, you are true. You're the King of the nations.
[time=1834] You are to be feared, you are to be glorified, you alone are holy, you are righteous.
[time=1842] And so we are again strengthened, if you will, bolstered, if you will, in our ability to continue to believe in a God who will bring this kind of wrath upon the earth,
[time=1852] even though in our current condition filled with the Holy Spirit as we are redeemed as we are, we still struggle with this concept.
[time=1860] All I can tell you is that when you get to heaven and you're glorified and you know all that you will know then,
[time=1866] you too will rejoice in singing this very song about the wrath of God upon a nation and upon nations and upon a world that has rejected Christ.
[time=1878] The second reason for the wrath of God is given in verse 5. It says there, "After these things I looked."
[time=1885] Now an interesting phrase here, "and the temple of the tabernacle of testimony in heaven was opened."
[time=1893] He's seeing there the heavenly temple, but he's calling it or it's being referenced or it's being viewed as the earthly temple of the Old Testament.
[time=1902] It's called the temple of the tabernacle of testimony. That was an often used phrase for the temple or the tabernacle in the Old Testament because it held the testimony of God.
[time=1913] It was in the tabernacle itself that the two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments, it was placed in there.
[time=1920] And so they would often refer to the temple or the tabernacle as the tabernacle of testimony, the place where the word of God is held.
[time=1927] So the obvious point is being made here by the Spirit of God. The second reason that the wrath of God is going to come is because the word of God has predicted it throughout all history.
[time=1938] All throughout the ages, the word of God has been faithful as he has sent his prophets to speak the word of impending doom and judgment.
[time=1946] Not just upon the nations of that day, but it even speaks of this great day of the Lord at the end of time.
[time=1954] You don't need to go there. I could take you to several Old Testament passages that speak of the wrath of God at the end of the age.
[time=1962] I'll just go to Joel chapter 3 verse 9 for a minute. He says, "They're proclaiming this among the nations. Prepare a war, rouse the mighty men, let all the soldiers draw near, let them come up and beat your plowshares into swords."
[time=1976] And your pruning hooks into spears, hasten and come, all use surrounding nations and gather yourselves there, bring down O Lord thy mighty ones.
[time=1985] Let the nations be aroused and come up to the valley of Jehosephat, for there I will sit to judge on the surrounding nations.
[time=1992] Put in the sickle for the harvest is ripe, come tread for the wine presses full, the vats overflow for their wickedness is great.
[time=2001] Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.
[time=2009] That's the Old Testament prophet Joel describing the day of the Lord, the great battle of Armageddon, and these seven bulls take us right to that moment in history.
[time=2020] So God is saying that my wrath comes because one of my character and two because I have promised wrath, I have promised wrath by my word to this wicked world.
[time=2029] Verse 6 shows how it happens. The seven angels had the seven plagues, they came out of the temple, clothed and linen, clean and bright and girded around their breasts with golden girdles.
[time=2039] And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bulls full of the wrath of God.
[time=2046] These are saucer like bulls we believe that would be rather shallow but rather broad, and the picture here is now these seven angels are just going to dump the wrath of God out by turning the bull over.
[time=2058] And out will flow all these plagues that we'll read about in chapter 16.
[time=2063] Notice verse 8 and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one was able to enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels was finished.
[time=2073] He fills the temple itself with his wrath and with his anger and with his glory as he's about to bring this final cataclysmic judgment upon the world.
[time=2082] 161 and I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels go and pour out the seven bulls of the wrath of God into the earth.
[time=2095] And that is what they're going to do. And as I have noted is a different wrath and has ever come upon the face of the earth ever before because of its comprehensive nature.
[time=2105] No one will escape it except parts of it believers will escape, but as far as the general mass of humanity, every nation, every tribe, every tongue, and every people.
[time=2116] And never before save the flood has that kind of wrath come upon the earth.
[time=2122] Well let's look at these.
[time=2125] Chapter 16 verse 2, "The first angel went out and poured his bull into the earth and it became a loathsome and malignant sore upon the men who had the mark of the beast and who worshipped his image."
[time=2140] Now medically we don't know a lot about these sores or these boils, but typically they would become infected and they would begin to swell until they finally burst.
[time=2153] And the stuff inside would run all over the body and it would be a one big gory mess of pain, physical pain, unrelenting physical pain.
[time=2167] And everybody got it except the believers. Here they are spared.
[time=2174] Says the universe to everyone who had the mark of the beast and who worshipped his image. And so God begins this great devastation by bringing physical pain by robbing people of their health.
[time=2186] Then a second angel comes in verse 3 and he pours out his bull into the sea and it became blood like that of a dead man and everything living in the sea died.
[time=2198] Now I'm told that the blood of a dead man turns a horribly gross dark color, becomes remarkably thick, it clots and it has a horrible odor, horrible odor.
[time=2213] And so you picture the sea with this sledge-like blood and it's not just AC, it's every sea, it's every little bit of salt water on the planet instantly turns into this this dark thick blood like substance.
[time=2231] And it stinks. But worse than that it kills everything that is in the sea.
[time=2238] And so all the industry and all the resources and all the production that depends upon the sea comes to a screeching halt.
[time=2247] And the sea becomes a floating surface of billions of stinking dead creatures that polluted surface.
[time=2253] I mean this is hard to conceive. This is so much disease and so much death and so much plague and so much stench that it's really hard to comprehend.
[time=2263] It's over. Every living thing in the sea is dead. And then the third bull in verse 4 and other angel comes and pours out his bull into the rivers and the springs of waters and they become blood.
[time=2281] Now a reference is being made to the fresh water sources of the world. And every single spring and every single river and every single fountain and every single water line, everywhere in the world becomes undrinkable.
[time=2297] It says there it became blood, it's not like blood, it is blood.
[time=2302] And of course our mind goes back to Egypt and how God brought that plague against Pharaoh and his people for their rebellion.
[time=2312] So in these first three bulls, we've lost our health. The human population has lost its health everybody and there's no cure for it.
[time=2322] They've lost a major source of food and industry which shuts them down and they've now have nothing to drink. Nothing. They can't find anything and whatever the world had stored up normally as far as sodas they may have in a can or things they can drink.
[time=2339] I mean all the world is going to consume that in a heartbeat and we're just going to be out of stuff to drink.
[time=2346] And now look at verses 5, 6, and 7, it's so severe the Lord feels again the need to remind us of his nature.
[time=2353] And I heard an angel of the water saying righteous art thou who art and who was and O holy one because thou didst judge these things for they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets and thou has given them blood to drink.
[time=2367] So there's an irony here, you have let the blood of my son and you have let the blood of my prophets through all of history and you have let the blood of the believers who were living inside the tribulation period who were telling you about Christ.
[time=2380] You've slipped their throats, you've killed them, you've martyred them and so I will now give you blood to drink.
[time=2387] And it will constantly remind you and mock you for your murder and then the end of verse 6 and they deserve it.
[time=2396] That's what they deserve.
[time=2398] Verse 7 and I heard the altar saying yes O Lord God the Almighty true and righteous are thy judgments.
[time=2406] Basically that's just a little vignette of chapter 15, it's the same stuff, the same themes come right back again and he must remind us over and over and over again, lest we fall into the horrible sin of imputing his nature that this is right and this is just and this is good.
[time=2422] Even though that may escape us even at this moment.
[time=2428] So boils, the ocean turns to blood, the fresh water turns to blood, everybody's hungry and thirsty and everybody's physically in pain because of these boils and then look at verse 8.
[time=2440] A fourth angel pours out his bowl upon the sun and it was given to it to scorch men with fire and men were scorched with fierce heat, not killed by it.
[time=2452] It's not that easy, their life isn't taken that quickly, they're scorched by it, they're burned.
[time=2458] Who knows, first, second, third degree burns and there's apparently no escaping that either.
[time=2465] Nothing to drink and burning, blazing heat that dries up and fries your skin.
[time=2472] I was talking to a friend of mine who lives in Arizona a couple of weeks ago and I said what, how hot does it get out there?
[time=2477] He said well, last year we had 120 degrees. I said what's that like?
[time=2483] Well they had, you know, we have thunderstorm watches, well they have heat watches and they can't go out and they can't do this stuff but unusual things were starting to happen.
[time=2491] Like the side rear, the side rear view mirrors on cars were falling off.
[time=2497] The actual glass was falling out because the glue they used to stick it in there got too hot.
[time=2503] I mean think of all the incidental disaster that's going to occur, the chaos that's going to happen when God allows the heat to become so intense that it not only scorches men with fire but all the other stuff that's going to go haywire.
[time=2516] We don't plan for it, beyond our normal boundaries of anticipation and stuff's just going to be falling apart.
[time=2524] And you think my, great time to repent, little hell on earth, little taste of the fires of hell right here in my presence and you learn about heaven and hell and people just begging for a drop of water on their tongue, there's nothing to drink, great time to repent.
[time=2543] Look at verse 9, scorch with fire, fierce heat, they blaspheme the name of God who has the power over these plagues and they did not repent so as to get him glory.
[time=2555] Man, it appears they know who he is, it appears they know that God is the one doing all this because they're blaspheming him, they're attributing it to him.
[time=2566] And so rather than falling on their knees in spiritual poverty, crying out saying if this is any little bit of taste of what's to come, I don't want any part of it, I repent, please forgive me.
[time=2578] And giving glory to God, they refuse to repent and instead they blaspheme him.
[time=2584] I believe there's a lesson to be learned there.
[time=2587] I believe this teaches us a lot about disbelief. We underestimate the power of unbelief, when people harden their hearts against God and they say no to Christ.
[time=2599] We in our mind say, oh man, if there was just some way they could get an angle on the grace of God, if there were just some way we could explain this to them, if there were just some little miracle that occur in their life, that would be enough and they'd see their wrong and they'd repent.
[time=2613] And that isn't to say we shouldn't keep trying to bring people to Christ as long as we have breath and life of course.
[time=2619] But to speak of it from their vantage point, these people had spurned the grace of God.
[time=2624] These people had heard the testimony of the 144,000 and the two witnesses and the angel flying through heaven and all the Gentile believers.
[time=2631] They had heard it all, the message of grace and the message of forgiveness and they continued to say no and reject and reject.
[time=2638] And now in the midst of these severe plagues, even scorching heat, their disbelief is just calcified and they're entrenched in it.
[time=2650] And you know what, these folks are going to go to hell, blaspheming God.
[time=2655] They're going to be shaking their angry fist at God as they are thrown into the lake of fire.
[time=2662] They'll have to confess Him as Lord, but it won't be for worship.
[time=2667] And there will be blaspheming in their mouth and there'll be an unrepentant heart as they fall into the fires of hell and for I know of no reason to say they won't maintain that same posture for all eternity.
[time=2680] For all eternity, cursing God and refusing to repent, not that their repentance would do them any good at that point.
[time=2690] They have turned from God and nothing will turn them back.
[time=2695] Well, it goes on, the fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast and his kingdom became darkened and they nod their tongues because of pain.
[time=2706] What's going on here?
[time=2707] Well, this fifth angel pours out his bowl, his plague upon the very throne of the beast.
[time=2714] We'll talk more about that next week, Lord willing.
[time=2718] But his kingdom becomes darkened and his kingdom is the kingdom of Satan, and we all know that Satan is the monarch of this world, and so we believe that the entire world goes to pitch black.
[time=2731] I don't know if you've ever been in pain and had to be in the dark.
[time=2735] And I think that may be some of the reason they inflict solitary confinement on prisoners because they're forced to be in the dark and they can't get their mind off of what is hurting and what is ailing them.
[time=2746] There is very little to distract them because they're in total darkness.
[time=2749] And so it appears here that God throws them in the darkness so that they can hurt over their boils and hurt over their hunger and hurt over their lack of water and their insatiable thirst that cannot be quenched because there's nothing to quench it and to hurt over the fact that their skin is on fire.
[time=2767] And in that condition he throws them into absolute utter darkness and says, "Think about it." There is no escape.
[time=2776] There is no escape, even mentally he is what he's saying.
[time=2780] There won't be any headsets to put on, there won't be any anesthetics to inject into the arm, there won't be any type of freedom from this absolute unrelenting pain.
[time=2790] And so they says there, they nod their tongues. They bite on their tongues. And they blaspheme God in verse 11.
[time=2799] They continue with their blaspheming because of their pains and their sores and they refuse to repent of their deeds.
[time=2808] It's almost as if he's saying, "I'm going to throw you into darkness so you can contemplate this one last time and I'm going to remove all the distractions."
[time=2816] And it'll just be you in the darkness with my plagues and I'm going to give you a one last chance to repent.
[time=2825] But instead they blaspheme and refuse to repent.
[time=2830] Verse 12, "The sixth angel poured out his bowl upon the great river, the river Euphrates, and its water was dried up that the way might be prepared for the kings of the east."
[time=2842] This is the beginning of God bringing all the armies of the world to the Battle of Armageddon.
[time=2847] The Euphrates river for centuries was a natural, still is, a natural barrier for the land of Israel.
[time=2855] In fact, it was the Babylonians, I don't know if you realize this, but Babylon is due east of Jerusalem.
[time=2862] But Babylon is often referred to in the Bible as the army from the north.
[time=2866] That's because Babylon couldn't get to Israel going due west because the river Euphrates blocked them.
[time=2872] And so they were forced on their campaigns to go all the way up to the top of the river Euphrates where they could cross and therefore we were referred to as the army from the north.
[time=2883] God's going to dry that river up.
[time=2886] And you say, "Big deal, we live in the age of jets and helicopters. What do we need a river to be dried up for?" And frankly, I don't fully understand that, but I do believe with all my heart that in this particular time of history, yet future, whether there is some need for a massive, you know, foot soldiers to occupy some land or the land of Israel itself, but for some reason it's going to be advantageous that the river Euphrates has dried up so that this army can make its way to Israel.
[time=2914] And they'll do that. They'll do that by their own volition and they'll do that by the inducing satanic spirits that are sent for them. Look at verse 13.
[time=2923] I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. That's the satanic trinity.
[time=2930] Three unclean spirits like frogs, for they are spirits of demons performing signs which go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.
[time=2942] So God now is going to allow these demon spirits to come up out of these, you know, the dragon and the beast and the false prophet.
[time=2952] And there is power given to these demons to perform signs and it's going to be a seductive kind of a thing. They're going to draw these kings, not just from the east, but from the whole world.
[time=2964] They're all going to be gathered together for the great day of God, the Almighty. Verse 16, they're gathered there in the place which in Hebrew is called "Harmageddon."
[time=2976] This is a phenomenal moment. And by the way, it's still dark. All these plagues seem to be cumulative.
[time=2989] So these armies are coming in the darkness. They are gathering under cover of darkness. You want to know what breaks the darkness?
[time=2999] Look at Revelation chapter 19 for a second. Hold your finger there. It stays dark until Revelation chapter 19 verse 11.
[time=3012] And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse. And he who sat upon it is called faithful and true. And in righteousness he judges and wages war and his eyes are a flame of fire and upon his head are many diadins.
[time=3028] And he has name written, has a name written upon him which no one knows except himself. And he is clothed with a robe dipped in blood and his name is called the Word of God.
[time=3040] Everybody wonders now how are we all going to see the coming of Christ at the same time. Well for one it's not going to be tough. It's going to be pitch black and he's going to show up on his white horse with his eyes of flaming fire and he's going to illumine the heavens when he comes.
[time=3054] And he will have gathered prior to that all the armies of the earth so he can slay them in the valley of decision.
[time=3062] Back to Revelation 16 verse 17 the seventh angel poured out his bowl upon the air and a loud voice came out of the temple of the throne saying it is done.
[time=3073] And there were flashes of lightning and sounds and peals of thunder and there was a great earthquake such as there had not been since man came to the upon the earth.
[time=3081] So great an earthquake was it and so mighty and the great city was split into three parts we believe that's Jerusalem and the cities of the nations fell under the power of this earthquake.
[time=3092] And babble on the great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath and every island fled away and the mountains were not found and huge hailstones about one hundred pounds each came down from heaven upon men.
[time=3109] Some of you have been around long enough to remember the ice man coming to your home to provide ice for your literally your ice box.
[time=3116] And he would bring those in twenty five fifty or one hundred pound chunks these are the hundred pound blocks these are the about the heaviest thing a guy a human being can pick up in this shape and form.
[time=3128] And they're going to descend from heaven and they're going to pick up speed and velocity and they're going to crash and pummel everything in their way.
[time=3137] One hundred pound blocks of ice crashing down upon the earth.
[time=3144] Well this great earthquake back up in verse eighteen is going to split the city of Jerusalem into three parts and the cities of the nations are going to fall Tokyo, London, Moscow, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco.
[time=3161] If this happens in their lifetime, this earthquake is going to level them they're going to fall they're going to crumble they're going to crush.
[time=3176] And then in verse twenty every island and there's no reason to believe that's just like the Hawaiian Islands Island as incontinent as incontinent shift.
[time=3187] Islands continents are fleeing away there's a massive shift in the configuration of the world and the mountains are not found huge twelve thirteen thousand foot mountains are just going to just crumble disappear they won't be there anymore.
[time=3204] That's how awesome this earthquake is and then God starts throwing hailstones from heaven.
[time=3211] What was their response verse twenty one the end of it and men blast theme God because of the plague of the hail because its plague was extremely severe.
[time=3223] There's no turning for these people they are locked in their sin they are locked in their disbelief and they will go that way to hell.
[time=3235] Well as we close let me just ask you to come over to John for a minute John chapter three.
[time=3245] When we go to John chapter three if you've been in the church at all you'll think of John three sixteen.
[time=3251] The marvelous message of hope for God so love the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
[time=3261] And that has been the message of the church and that will continue to be the message of the church until the rapture.
[time=3268] But let your eyes glance down or across the page to verse thirty six.
[time=3275] He who believes in the sun has eternal life but he who does not obey the sun shall not see life but the wrath of God abides on him.
[time=3290] As we began this morning let me remind you that there is a general cause and effect in the judgment of God and if you violate his moral laws you break yourself against them.
[time=3299] But there is another level of judgment there is another level of wrath and God brings it on people because they reject Christ.
[time=3308] They refuse to obey the son of Christ the son of God Jesus Christ and the wrath of God abides upon him.
[time=3317] Think back just for a last moment through these plagues and realize the reverse of all of them is found in Christ.
[time=3324] It's almost as if God is saying through the loathsome malignant sores he's saying if you will not come to my son and allow him to heal you spiritually then I will make you physically sick.
[time=3339] If you will not eat of the bread of life my son Jesus Christ and I will wipe out your food supply.
[time=3346] If you will not drink of the water of life in Christ then I will contaminate all your water and give you to drink the unmixed wine of my wrath.
[time=3356] If you will not take the yoke of my son whose load is light and who gives rest for the soul then I will scorch you with the heat of the noonday son.
[time=3367] If you will not open your eyes to my son who is the light of the world then I will put out the light of the son and let you walk in complete darkness.
[time=3378] If you the cities of the world will not respond to the lament of my son for the Holy City oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how often I have wanted to gather you together then I will shake the earth and in my wrath cause your cities to fall.
[time=3396] Jesus healed the sick Jesus fed the hungry Jesus gave living water to the thirsty Jesus gave sight to the blind Jesus brings hope to the city.
