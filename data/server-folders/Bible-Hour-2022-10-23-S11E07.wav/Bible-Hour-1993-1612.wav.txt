[time=0] In stead, as it says, they will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into
[time=16] pruning legs.
[time=17] They'll be no use any longer for weapons of war because they'll be learning the ways of Christ and where there is dissension and where there is misunderstanding and where there would be a remnant of greed or selfishness.
[time=30] Christ himself will make the judgment, it will be fair, it will be equitable, and he will rule with a rod of iron.
[time=36] His decision will be law.
[time=50] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=57] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=58] Thank you for joining us.
[time=60] Man has long dreamed of a golden age when the world would be free of war, hatred and murder.
[time=66] A day when justice prevailed and the world would be a peace.
[time=70] That day is coming.
[time=72] When Christ returns to this earth, he will sit on the throne of David and Jerusalem and from there, he will bring a rule of peace and blessing to the entire world.
[time=81] Stay with us today as we look at this glorious day.
[time=85] Pastor Russell Moore will be speaking from the book of Revelation, chapter 20.
[time=89] In a message he has entitled, "The Millennium." Our special music today will be provided by the men singers and a duet by Marilyn Wong
[time=101] and Marsha Richard.
[time=105] Let us join our chastel choir as they begin our service.
[time=126] For the gods of the nations are idols, for the Lord be the heavens, the Lord be the heaven.
[time=141] He clear his glory among the even, his wonders among the people, for the world is great,
[time=150] and great is every present, honor and majesty, glory for him.
[time=164] Strength and beauty are in his sanctuary, strength and beauty are in his sanctuary,
[time=174] given to the Lord, oh, he can breathe of the people, given to the Lord, the glory to his name.
[time=188] Bring him off, bring him coming to his heart, to his heart.
[time=200] Oh, worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness,
[time=225] He clear his glory among the even, his wonders among the people, for the world is great,
[time=241] and great is every present, honor and majesty, glory for him.
[time=253] He clear his glory among the even, his wonders among the people, for the world is great,
[time=261] and great is every present, the Lord is great, and great is every present.
[time=284] What a wonderful change in my life has been brought!
[time=296] Since Jesus came into my heart, I've been changed by the power, resurrection power,
[time=304] that conquered God forever, that won the victory, I've been changed by the power,
[time=310] resurrection power, even now, is working my way in me.
[time=316] The very power that raised up Jesus from the grave, made me a new creation on the day that I got saved.
[time=324] It's filthy rags, I used to wear a spotless coat of wine, I just can't keep it silent, I've got a test to fight.
[time=333] I've been changed by the power, resurrection power, that conquered that forever, and won the victory.
[time=341] I've been changed by the power, resurrection power, even now, is working my way in me.
[time=348] I've been changed, I've been new, my life has been rearranged.
[time=356] What a difference it made when the Lord came and stayed in my heart, oh yes, I've been changed, I've been changed.
[time=366] I've been changed by the power, resurrection power, that conquered that forever, and won the victory.
[time=374] I've been changed by the power, resurrection power, even now, is working my way in me.
[time=382] I've been changed by the power, resurrection power, power.
[time=389] What a wonderful change in my life has been wrong in my heart, oh yes, I've been changed.
[time=410] I'm so glad that you joined us for the Bible hour this week.
[time=414] I hope that last week's program was very special for you as we had as our guests, the singers from the former Soviet Union.
[time=423] A lot of blessing it was to hear of the testimony that they had in the last number of years when they were under the Communist rule,
[time=430] in spite of the threat of persecution they indeed praised God with their song and testimony.
[time=438] We're praising the Lord that that country is now open to the gospel and that many missionaries are going over there
[time=445] and telling people about the glorious wonder of Jesus Christ and His saving power.
[time=452] So I hope that the music and the excitement of what is happening over there in Russia was a great blessing to you on the Bible hour last week.
[time=460] And then we're just about to end the opportunity for you to get the Bible character cards that we've been offering this summer.
[time=468] A great opportunity for you to teach your children and grandchildren the various characters found in our Bible.
[time=475] So if you'd like to receive a packet of 72 cards with pictures and then a little biography of each character from the Scriptures,
[time=483] you can write to the Bible hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=493] Once again, just write to the Bible hour, ask for the Bible character cards.
[time=498] The address is 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=507] Last week, I had the opportunity to go to California and visit my folks. My uncle is ill.
[time=514] If you get an opportunity to pray for Tony Coby, we'd appreciate that right now.
[time=519] Also, it was great to see the Bible hour presented in California.
[time=525] I really enjoyed that and I hope that those of you that watch on the station out there are enjoying the ministry of the Bible hour.
[time=533] We also want to encourage you to stay tuned each week because Pastor Moore is in a series in the book of Revelation.
[time=540] It's very important that you get the continuity of the very interesting facts about the end times concerning our relationship
[time=548] to what's going to happen when Christ returns and His reign on this earth, all of that being very informative for the Christian.
[time=555] So I hope that you'll continue to stay tuned for the Bible hour. If you get a chance to write us and just tell us that you're watching, we'd really appreciate that.
[time=563] We're going back now to the live portion of our service. May God bless you.
[time=580] I am not worthy the least of His favor, but Jesus left heaven for me.
[time=593] The word became flesh and He died as my savior, forsaken on dark cavalry.
[time=607] I am not worthy this Dalton repeats it.
[time=615] I am not worthy this heart gladly beats it.
[time=622] Jesus left heaven to die in my place.
[time=630] What mercy, what love, and what grace.
[time=642] I am not worthy the least of His favor, but He is preparing a place.
[time=655] Where I shall dwell with my glorified Savior, forever to look on His face.
[time=668] I am not worthy this Dalton repeats it.
[time=676] I am not worthy this heart gladly beats it.
[time=683] Jesus left heaven to die in my place.
[time=692] What mercy, what love, and what grace.
[time=714] [AMEN] Thank you. Marcia and Marilyn, as you know, are sisters.
[time=720] If you couldn't pick that up from looking at them or from hearing it in their voices.
[time=724] I love it when sisters sing.
[time=726] I have three older sisters and I love it when they sing together.
[time=729] They have a wonderful rendition of Boogie Wogie Bugleboy.
[time=735] They even sing that at Heidi's and my rehearsal dinner.
[time=739] And if we could just find a way to get them all back here at the same time.
[time=743] Well, maybe church wouldn't be the right one.
[time=746] You could forgive me that one time.
[time=748] We could have fun.
[time=750] If you'll take your Bibles and open them to Revelation chapter 20.
[time=755] We'll go back to our study of this marvelous book which has really captured my heart and mind.
[time=762] And I hope yours as well as we've been forced to think about the end of the world.
[time=766] And we're now coming to the end of the book about the end of the world.
[time=769] And things are really moving.
[time=771] Chapter 20 is going to cover a thousand years in time and really launch us into eternity.
[time=779] Out of time and space completely and into a thing called eternity.
[time=783] And man has often dreamed and longed for a golden age.
[time=790] Musicians have written songs and sung about it and authors have written books about it and politicians have promised it and yet never delivered it.
[time=800] A time when there would be no more war, when there would be no hatred or murder or strife all around the globe a time of absolute peace.
[time=809] Just wonderful joyous, relaxing, harmonious peace in which the world, people of the world could coexist and cooperate and get along together and use their talents and their strengths and their energies to promote what is good and healthy and right as opposed to using their time and their talent and their energy and their strengths to fight each other and to destroy one another's nations and countries and people.
[time=835] We have long dreamed of a golden age in which justice would prevail when truth would be lifted up and it would be the guiding standard where partiality would be no more and the injustice that come because of a people's skin color or a vocation or a handicap or some other type of limiting factor would not be the issue in their life but instead because of truth and justice they would be treated fairly and equitably.
[time=863] The Bible says that such a day is coming. The Bible says very clearly that for a thousand years those kinds of conditions will prevail upon planet earth.
[time=874] Christ will actually come back to the earth. Not as he did the first time as a baby, as an infant, in a manger, he will come in splendid glory as a full grown adult and he will sit on a throne, a physical literal throne in the city of Jerusalem.
[time=892] And while he sits on that throne for a thousand years he will rule and reign over the entire earth. Every people, tribe, tongue and nation will be directly under his rule.
[time=905] It's a glorious day. It is the golden age. And I'd like to have you look at it with me for a minute before we get the revelation 20 or really in preparation of that.
[time=915] So if you'll hold your place there and come back to the book of Isaiah. And Isaiah in a several different places in his book will begin in Isaiah chapter 2 is going to give us some descriptions about what we call the millennium.
[time=929] The word millennium doesn't appear anywhere in the Bible. It's a Latin word that means one thousand years. And we have just taken the term millennium and used it to describe this blessed golden age when Christ sits on the throne for a thousand years.
[time=944] Isaiah chapter 2 verses 2 through 4. Now it will come about that in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord will be established as the chief of the mountains and will be raised above the hills and all the nations will stream to it.
[time=961] And many people will come and say come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord to the house of the God of Jacob that he may teach us concerning his ways and that we may walk in his paths for the law will go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
[time=979] And he will judge between the nations and will render decisions for many peoples and they will hammer their swords into plowshears and their spears into pruning hooks nation will not lift up sword against nation and never again will they learn war.
[time=995] Now picture this with me. The Lord Jesus Christ is sitting in Jerusalem the physical tangible you can touch him you can hear him you can see him you can ask him questions he's sitting in Jerusalem on the throne.
[time=1008] And the people of the world the leaders of the nations are seeking his wisdom and so they travel from wherever they are to the city of Jerusalem to find opportunity to counsel with him for the explicit purpose of learning his law being taught by him his ways so that as it says they can walk in his path.
[time=1028] This is not idle learning this is not speculation this is not theorizing the leaders of the world are coming to Christ so that they can learn his law and apply it in their own nation live according to it live according to his law and his path walk in his path.
[time=1046] Then verse four says that he will judge between the nations when there is a dispute between the nations whether it be a trade agreement or boundaries of national boundaries or whatever it may be whatever may cause some level of disagreement or disharmony and there needs some decision Christ himself will decide he will make that decision for them.
[time=1069] It guarantees justice it guarantees absolute knowledge of the situation there will be no stone left unturned in his investigation because he's omniscient he'll know everything about it and he'll make the right decision the first time and it will be followed.
[time=1084] As a result people will beat their weapons of war into useful items by which to cultivate the land and make the earth a better place.
[time=1096] It sounds marvelous doesn't it's coming more description of it in chapter 11 come over with me to Isaiah chapter 11 and look at verses six and following and here it moves from a national international level to a much more personal level.
[time=1114] Isaiah chapter 11 verse six and the wolf will dwell with the lamb apparently there will be some level of reversing the curse.
[time=1124] And the animals of nature will cohabitate peacefully it goes on and the leopard will lie down with the kid and the calf with the young lion and the fatling together and the little boy will lead them.
[time=1138] In other words they're not only kind to each other they're now in harmony and peace with people verse seven also the cow and the bear will graze their young will lie down together and the lion will eat straw like the ox and the nursing child will play by the whole of the cobra to which Heidi says not my little Bobby.
[time=1159] And the ween child will put his hand on the viper's den they will not hurt or destroy an all my holy mountain for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the water covers the sea.
[time=1173] So a whole new day is coming yet still on this planet on this earth with the same animals but their nature has been changed they no longer apparently are carnivorous and they live in harmony with each other and with humans.
[time=1188] And that whole threat of danger and fear which we are largely isolated from because we live in a civilized society but people throughout generations of the earth's history have not been isolated from this kind of thing.
[time=1201] It's different it's new one more place Isaiah 65 he gives us yet another glimpse. Isaiah 65 verses 19 and following.
[time=1221] Isaiah 65 verse 19 I will also rejoice in Jerusalem and be glad in my people and there will no longer be heard in her the voice of weeping and the sound of crying.
[time=1233] No longer will there be it in it an infant who lives but a few days or an old man who does not live out his days for the youth will die at the age of 100 that will be an early death.
[time=1244] And the one who does not reach the age of a hundred shall be thought accursed in other words Christ will reign in this period with a rod of iron and one of the ways he'll reign is he'll he'll dispense of people capital punishment he'll take their life.
[time=1258] And so if somebody doesn't reach at least a hundred years of age likely the cause will be their own sin not physical sickness or some mishap a car accident a plane crash food poisoning those kinds of things don't seem to exist in the Millennial Kingdom.
[time=1272] The world is at peace the world is at harmony the only thing that would cause a premature death would be judgment for sin.
[time=1281] Verse 21 and they shall build houses and inhabit them they shall also plant vineyards and eat their fruit they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the lifetime of a tree so shall be the days of my people.
[time=1295] Several hundred years old some trees live three four hundred years longer they shall not labor in vain verse twenty three or bear children for calamity.
[time=1306] In other words what they produce is going to be good and when they have children the expectation is going to be that they'll have a nice long life too they'll be confidence in the future.
[time=1316] For they are the offspring of those blessed by the Lord and their descendants with them verses twenty four and twenty five it will also come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they are still speaking I will hear the responsiveness of God in this particular period of history will be immediate.
[time=1335] And then the wolf and the lamb shall graze together the lion shall eat straw like the ox and the dust shall be the serpent's food they shall do no evil or harm in all my holy mountains says the Lord.
[time=1348] This is a tremendous period of time in the history of the earth this one thousand years.
[time=1356] Now if you will come back to Revelation chapter twenty with that as its description in order for that to occur several things must take place first in order for millennial conditions to become predominating.
[time=1370] There are some things that must occur and we've already seen several of them number one Christ has to come back if Christ doesn't come back none of this stuff happens.
[time=1380] When Christ comes back as you know as we've studied in Revelation nineteen there is the battle of Armageddon and that is led by the false prophet and the antichrist and Satan through these demons where he gathers all the armies of the world together outside of Jerusalem Christ comes back and slays them all with the sword that comes from his mouth.
[time=1400] Then what does he do he takes the beast and the false prophet and he throws them into the lake of fire the first inhabitants of the lake of fire.
[time=1412] Well we didn't cover last time and which I'll just allude to this morning he does a couple of other things he does in Matthew twenty five what is called the the the judgment of the Gentile nations you refer to it as the sheep and the goat judgment.
[time=1426] And he calls all the remaining people everybody who didn't die there in the battle of Armageddon just the armies there but the people that they represent he judges all the world at this time the living world the people who are alive on the planet in this sheep goat judgment based upon how they treated the nation.
[time=1441] And how they treated the nation of Israel and if they treated the nation of Israel with kindness and benevolence and help and support and protection through the tribulation it reveals to Christ that they have a regenerate heart that they were truly born again that they loved Christ he invites those people into the Millennial Kingdom.
[time=1462] The other people refer to as the goats who who rejected Israel and persecuted Israel and when after Israel reveal their heart to have rejected also Christ and so he he dispenses with them he sends them to destruction.
[time=1479] It says in Ezekiel I believe chapter 20 that he not only does that with the Gentile nations but then he also reviews the nation of Israel itself to call out from it the believing remnant from the people of Israel those who are just Israel in name only are also sent to destruction.
[time=1497] So at the beginning of the millennium the end of the tribulation Christ come the battle of Armageddon he does the sheep and the goat judgment he judges the nation of Israel he kills everybody who isn't saved and he invites everybody else whether Jewish or any other nation of the world he invites all the saved people who are the only people left on the earth into the 1000 year Millennial reign of Christ.
[time=1518] So now the conditions are becoming set for the kind of peace and the kind of tranquility and the kind of happiness that we've read about in Isaiah chapter 11.
[time=1528] Christ is physically on his throne and the only people arrive on the planet are born again believers.
[time=1535] But there are two other things he must do to create Millennial conditions and they are the first two paragraphs of Revelation chapter 20.
[time=1545] Verses one through three and I saw an angel coming down from heaven having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand and he laid hold of the dragon the serpent of old who is the devil and Satan and bound him for a thousand years and threw him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him so that he should not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were completed after these things he must be released for a short time.
[time=1574] John chapter 12 verse 31 says that Satan is the ruler of this world. Ephesians 2.2 calls Satan the prince of the power of the air.
[time=1588] Second Corinthians 4.4 says that Satan blinds the minds of the unbelieving so that they will not accept the good news of the gospel. In fact they cannot see the glorious light of the gospel of God.
[time=1600] First Peter 5.8 says that Satan is our adversary and he is prowling about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[time=1608] Satan has been given dominion over the world after he fell and after Adam and he fell Satan was given dominion over the world as described in these terms ruler of the world, prince of the power of the air, the roaring lion who seeks someone to devour.
[time=1623] In fact in Luke chapter 4 just before Christ embarks on his public ministry he has led off into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan.
[time=1632] He has had nothing to eat for 40 days. He is in a preeminent point of temptation or at a point of whatever human weakness he had.
[time=1639] Satan that says there shows him the kingdoms of the world. Now we don't know how he did that but he showed Christ all the kingdoms of the world.
[time=1648] And then he said this Luke 4.6, "I will give you all this domain and its glory for it has been handed over to me and I give it to whomever I wish."
[time=1663] You can't always believe Satan but when you hear him saying that in conjunction with these other phrases he is called ruler of the world, prince of the power of the air, he blinds the minds of the unbelieving, he is the prowling lion and other places in Scripture.
[time=1677] That basically is true. God had given Satan the dominion over the world when Adam and Eve fell. It was his to give away. Christ of course rejected it.
[time=1690] Before millennial conditions can occur this ruler of the world, this prince of the power of the air must be bound.
[time=1698] He must be locked up. And so you see this angel coming out of heaven with a key to the abyss and you've read about the abyss already in Revelation chapter 9.
[time=1708] You remember a different angel opened the abyss and hordes of demons came out.
[time=1713] We've read about the abyss in other places of the word of God. Second Peter 2.4. Those demons that tried to cohabitate with women before the flood have been tartarized there.
[time=1724] They have been put in the abyss and held there. Now Satan goes there. And the chain that he is held with is likely not a physical chain.
[time=1732] It is representative of the restrictive constraining power of God given to this angel to lock and to hold Satan in the abyss so that he cannot deceive the nations any longer.
[time=1743] He no longer has any impact on the planet and the people of the planet. That says that in verse 3. So that he should not deceive the nations any longer until the thousand years were completed and we'll get to that in a minute.
[time=1758] So the thing that Revelation draws our attention to with respect to the millennium is that Satan is gone. Satan is out of the picture. He is no longer having any impact on anybody for anything and so are his demons and that really is implied.
[time=1774] But the world is now free of demonic and satanic influence. What's the next thing he does? Look at verses 4 and follow.
[time=1781] In order to create millennial conditions he binds Satan and then there are these thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given to them.
[time=1790] And I saw the souls of those who have been beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God and those who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received the mark upon their forehead and upon their hand and they came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
[time=1806] Now there's actually two groups of people in this verse and they're a little difficult to identify. Let me try to help you. The first group in the beginning of the verse and I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given to them. Call that group 1 and I'll explain them to you in a minute.
[time=1821] The second group moves from there and I saw the souls of those who have been beheaded and he goes on to describe there the tribulation saints.
[time=1830] We know their tribulation saints because they refuse to worship the beast, take the mark etc. They are resurrected. They are brought back to life and they are put on thrones and they reign in the millennial kingdom.
[time=1844] In other words people who loved and followed an obeyed Christ during the tribulation are at this point resurrected given resurrected bodies and sit on thrones with Christ in the millennial kingdom. That's the second group. Now back to the first.
[time=1857] I saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given to them and there's some debate inside of the evangelical community as to who these people are, who's this first group.
[time=1868] And I think that the answer comes relatively simply in this line of reasoning. Who is it that Christ promised could sit on thrones with him and reign in the millennial kingdom?
[time=1881] If we could figure out who those people are we'd have a pretty good idea of who's sitting there with them. The answer to that question is one Old Testament saints.
[time=1890] We won't turn to this morning but Daniel 7 verses 18 and 21 God promised believers in the Old Testament that they would reign with him in the millennial kingdom.
[time=1900] The second group is all the New Testament saints, that's you and that's me. We saw that some months ago Revelation 2 talks about that, tells us about our thrones verse 26.
[time=1914] And he who overcomes and he who keeps my deeds until the end to him I will give authority over the nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of the potter are broken to pieces.
[time=1925] Revelation 321 also tells us that we'll be on those thrones. He who overcomes I will grant to him to sit down with me on my throne as I also overcame and sat down with my father on his throne.
[time=1938] And then of course Revelation 20 verse 4 tells us that there's the tribulation saints. So there's three groups of people on these thrones.
[time=1946] Number 1 all the Old Testament believers get resurrected and they're a part of these thrones and they rule in the millennium.
[time=1953] Number 2 all the New Testament saints all the people of the part of the church will be resurrected and sitting on these thrones.
[time=1960] And thirdly tribulation saints resurrected and sitting on thrones. Now do you know what that means? Do you have any idea what that will be like?
[time=1969] Christ is in Jerusalem. Christ has a problem in China. There are some concerns over there. Who does he send? Well he's got quite a little list of people to pick from.
[time=1985] He could send Abraham. He could send Joseph. He could send Isaiah. He could send Daniel. Depending upon the problem if it's a political problem maybe we'll send Daniel.
[time=2000] If it's a spiritual problem maybe we'll send Isaiah. Well but then maybe on the other hand Hudson Taylor. He was a great missionary to China. He loves those people so dearly.
[time=2010] He brought great thousands of them to Christ. Maybe I'll send him to. In other words Christ located geographically in Jerusalem but his emissaries of his reign are being executed by the greatest people who have ever lived on the planet.
[time=2026] Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Elijah, Daniel, Isaiah, the Apostle Paul, Peter, James, John, Stephen, the one who was martyred. He think he has a heart and compassion for people to execute the rule of Christ on the earth during this thousand years.
[time=2044] People like Calvin and Martin Luther and Spurgeon and John Whitcliffe and George Whitfield and D.L. Moody and Billy Graham and then there's just us, the common folk. But we won't be so common anymore because we'll be resurrected in our glorified bodies and we'll never think sinful thoughts or selfish thoughts or become tired.
[time=2062] And when Christ wants something covered in another part of the earth he just sends a bunch of us over there. And we handle the problem. We administrate his leadership.
[time=2072] So when you read here that the millennial kingdom will be overseen by Christ himself and then all of us who sit upon these thrones you're reading about one of the most glorious periods in the history of the world when all of the best of the best have been made better by their resurrection and glorification and now all brought back to planet earth to rule and to reign.
[time=2093] So here's Avi, the golden age. Satan is bound. His demons are bound. All the unbelievers are gone. And it's just glorified saints executing the very wisdom and the precise, intimate concern of Christ over redeemed population on the earth.
[time=2110] That's when I'd like to live. I mean that's the time. That's the place. And they will produce these marvelous millennial conditions.
[time=2121] But what amazes me and shocks me and I shouldn't be shocked come with me to verse seven. Look at this. This is unbelievable. A thousand years of this actually start at the end of verse six.
[time=2133] They will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years. So you got a whole thousand years of this kind of leadership. The memory of Satan must be gone.
[time=2142] The memory of sinful, selfish people must be gone. The memory of the Holocaust and all the horrible things would be wiped out. You've got a thousand years of the reign of Christ now verse seven. And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison. He'll come up out of the abyss.
[time=2156] And we'll come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, God and Megag to gather them together for the war. And you say, wait a minute. He'll be totally ineffective in that. Nobody will follow Satan.
[time=2168] Everybody will have been under the rule and reign of Christ and all his glorified saints. They'll have seen the prosperity. They'll have seen the peace. They'll have experienced his wisdom and his blessing and his joy. He'll immediately be answering prayers.
[time=2181] All the issues of life will be resolved under his wonderful, glorious leadership. The environment itself will be perfect. No one will follow Satan.
[time=2193] Guess again, look at the end of verse eight. And the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. That's a biblical phrase for too many to count. Inumerable. Inumerable. You say, how does that happen? How does that happen?
[time=2214] Well, in the millennium, people will have kids. Children. And those children will have children's children and children's children in the whole thousand years of children's children. And so while the whole population started out believers, the next generation will lose some and the next generation will lose some and the next generation will lose some.
[time=2233] And even though the environment, and I'm speaking politically, socially, economically, and physically, the environment of the millennium will be perfect.
[time=2241] And the very Christ himself will be on the earth. And only the redeem will be ruling.
[time=2249] Wickedness. The wickedness of man will be lying latent, waiting for Satan to entice, deceive, and lead.
[time=2264] Now there's some heavy implications to that, folks. Let me give it to you as one theologian said it.
[time=2270] Will not a thousand years under the beneficent sway of Christ and the manifested glory of God suffice to render men immune to Satan's temptations?
[time=2280] Will they not have radically changed for the better and become by the altered conditions of life and the absence of satanic temptations?
[time=2289] Children of God and lovers of His will? Alas, it will be proved once more that man, whatever his advantages and environment apart from the grace of God and the new birth, remains at heart only evil and at enmity with God.
[time=2309] You understand what He's saying? You can put people in a perfect environment, give them Christians for parents, have Christ on the throne, and still they have to contend with their own sinful nature.
[time=2323] And unless that is radically conformed and transformed by the power of the gospel, they will stay sinners and at first opportunity to rebel, they will take it.
[time=2335] And with that rebellion in their heart, they will follow Satan to the beloved city, look at verse 9, and they came upon the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, namely Jerusalem.
[time=2348] They will follow Satan to the very streets of Jerusalem, to the gates of the Davidic kingdom, and they will seek to tear Christ from His throne and kill Him.
[time=2360] Now that should say something to us in our society. Our society is saying that we are rotten and we are in trouble because of our environment.
[time=2373] We have been victimized, you see? And because of how my parents treated me, and because of how the government has treated me, and because of how I'm caught in the inner city, or because of how this has occurred, or this has occurred, I am a serial killer.
[time=2390] I am a lazy sluggard who doesn't want to work. I'm a dishonest person who would cheat somebody out of their next meal if I do it and didn't think I'd get caught.
[time=2400] Our society is blaming the whole problem of humanity on the environment itself. Well folks here is a perfect environment. For a thousand years, the only contingency is the human heart.
[time=2417] And when it is finally given an opportunity to rebel, it seeks not just to rebel, but to head straight for Jerusalem and strike the king dead.
[time=2429] It seems obvious that the solution to the problems that we face in our country and in every other age before us and in every other age after us is not the environment.
[time=2438] And it's not wise for us to be blaming everybody else for our problems. It is to come to grips with the transforming power of the gospel that resides in the person of Jesus Christ and be changed from the inside out and therefore live differently despite our circumstances.
[time=2455] And then bad circumstances and hardships and trials, as we know from the Word of God, work only to refine our character, perfect us into the image of Christ and make us more holy instead of driving us into sin.
[time=2471] I think if you consider the implications of that into social work and to governmental policy and to secular psychology and to the whole host of solutions that are being proposed by people in leadership in our country and around the world to today's problems, you'll find there's a huge gap that cannot be spanned.
[time=2494] Christ is the answer to national problems, international problems and personal problems and there is no other answer.
[time=2506] Not even his external reign creating a perfect millennial environment for a thousand years. Not even that's the answer.
[time=2517] It also tells us something remarkable about Satan. The individual is incredibly wicked. He has been in the throne room of God. He has held the privileged position of probably the highest created angel in all of the world or eternity's history.
[time=2533] He has seen and been face to face with God. He has known his holiness. He has seen his righteousness. He has seen his power. He has chosen to rebel against that God and lived out all of human history and defiance to him, killing and devouring anyone he can possibly see.
[time=2546] He sees his ultimate death and doom at the resurrection of Christ so many thousand years ago. He sees his whole army wiped out at Armageddon. He is himself thrown by a meager angel into the abyss for a thousand years you'd think at the end of that time.
[time=2561] He come out with some sense of repentance or remorse or sorrow for all he has done but instead the moment he has liberated he too beats a path for Jerusalem because that's where Christ is and that's the one he hates and that's the one he wants to kill and that's the one he wants to overthrow.
[time=2581] Satan is incurably wicked and nothing can turn him from his sin. So in verse 10 look at it.
[time=2593] The devil, well first I need to finish verse 9, look at God's response to these armies, to these peoples of the world that come against him in the city of Jerusalem, fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
[time=2604] He just destroyed them all and then verse 10. And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are also and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
[time=2619] Now we labor under this misconception that we get from cartoons or movies or books or wherever we get it that Satan runs hell.
[time=2628] That Satan stands at the door of hell with his pitchfork and his little ears and his pointed tail and his little pink suit and he waits for people and greets them and ushers them into hell where they then must experience his torments.
[time=2641] Folks, Satan does not rule hell. You want to know who runs hell? God runs hell. Hell was made for Satan, not by Satan, Matthew 25.
[time=2654] Satan is found here, read it again in verse 10, the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are also.
[time=2663] Now the they grabs all three of them and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
[time=2671] Satan doesn't run hell. Satan is going to be tortured there, punished there, held there forever and ever and ever in living conscious torment.
[time=2683] So get it straight. Satan doesn't run hell. Satan is tortured in hell.
[time=2692] Well, if you're thinking with me this morning we're talking in large groups of people. We know where all the Old Testament saints are. We're sitting on the throne.
[time=2700] We know where all the New Testament saints are. They're sitting on thrones. We know where all the Tribulation Saints are. They're sitting on thrones.
[time=2709] We know where the beast and the prophet are. They're in the lake of fire. We also know where Satan is. He's in the lake of fire. There's only one group left.
[time=2718] The unredeemed. Where are all the unbelievers in the Old Testament? All the people who lived in the Old Testament era that died without God. Where are they?
[time=2729] And where are all the people in our time of history? The New Testament church age who have died and rejected Christ. And then all of those that were wiped out in the Tribulation, where are all these people?
[time=2740] And what happens to them? Well, I'll read verses 11 and following.
[time=2746] And I saw a great white throne and he who sat upon it from whose presence earth and heaven fled away and there was no place found for them.
[time=2755] And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne. And books were opened and another book was opened, which is the book of life.
[time=2764] And the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books according to their deeds. Verse 13.
[time=2772] And the sea gave up the dead which were in it. And death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every one of them according to their deeds.
[time=2782] And death and Hades were thrown in the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown in the lake of fire.
[time=2795] We don't have time to go to the scriptures this morning to show this to you, but in the Old Testament and the New Testament, people who died without Christ were placed in a holding tank, not purgatory, not some place they could work their way out of.
[time=2811] It was judgment. It was trauma. It was torture. It is not as described as difficult as hell, but it is a place of torment, of captivity called sheol and Hades.
[time=2823] And the Bible doesn't tell us much about it. Sometimes it's referred to as the grave. Sometimes the grave is referred to as the door into Hades and sheol.
[time=2831] But there are enough passages, Luke 16, for example, where the rich man cries out. He's burning. He's in torment. He's conscious. He's wanting to warn his brethren that this place is a horrible place. Don't come here.
[time=2843] And give us some understanding that where you go immediately after you die, if you don't know Christ is either to one of these two places as it's referred to, maybe the same place, actually just different names, sheol and Hades.
[time=2855] What you're reading about here in verses 11 to 15 is when all of those dead from all the generations of time are brought back up out of sheol and Hades and stand before God for final judgment.
[time=2869] And it's a legal passage. It's full of legal terminology. So let me just give you quickly now seven features of this great white throne judgment. Seven quick features. Just touch on them so you'll see that they're there.
[time=2881] The first is the courtroom. In verse 11 it says, "And I saw a great white throne. This is undoubtedly the throne we read about in Revelation chapter 4. You don't need to go there. Remember it was a throne standing in heaven and one sitting on the throne. He was sitting like a jaspers stone and sardis in appearance. And there was a rainbow around the throne like an emerald in appearance.
[time=2905] And around the throne were 24 elders and from the throne proceeded flashes and lightning and sounds and peals of thunders and before the throne were the seven spirits of God. And in the center and around the throne, four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back. Remember what they were saying? Holy, holy, holy. Folks, this is a rude awakening for the unbeliever.
[time=2925] These are the people who went to their grave with clenched fists and gnarled teeth in the very grace of God and said, "I don't believe in God and I don't believe in Christ and I don't believe on the center and I don't believe I need to be weak and come to Christ and lean on religion. I'll be just fine on my own thank you."
[time=2943] These are the people who died in defiance to the grace of God and they thought they've had it bad for the last who knows how many centuries as they've been held in Hades and Sholes but in an instant and beyond their power and without warning, they are brought up out of that place and they stand before the very throne room of God.
[time=2961] There are peals of thunders and lightning and flashes and this huge throne and the person sitting on it looks like a marvelous jewel and they can't understand it and there's heavenly creatures flying around singing the song about the holiness of God and it's just absolutely more than they can conceive.
[time=2975] They are now in the courtroom of God.
[time=2979] The next thing that happens is they see him, the judge, the second thing, won the courtroom to the judge. She's just referenced very briefly and I saw the great white throne and him who sat upon it and we don't know exactly who he is.
[time=2993] We don't know if it's God the Father, we don't know if it's God the Son, we don't know if it's the whole Trinity and I'm not so sure that we have to know.
[time=3001] So my best guess is that it's Christ. Let me tell you why. John 5.22 says this, "The Father has given all judgment to the Son." John 9.39, "For judgment I came into the world," said Christ.
[time=3016] Acts 10.42, "Christ has been appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead."
[time=3024] I don't understand. Most of my life I was thinking of the great white throne judgment, God the Father sitting there doing the judgment but then I come across these verses and I think, "Well, maybe that's Christ. I don't really know."
[time=3034] But I know it's divine. It's either God the Father, God the Son, or God the Holy Spirit, or all three of them, or one of them.
[time=3041] Secondly, look at the defendants.
[time=3044] Number one, the courtroom, number two, the judge, number three, the defendants, verses 12 and 13 and I saw the dead, the great and the small standing before the throne.
[time=3053] They're further described in verse 13 and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them.
[time=3062] The sea may be mentioned because in John's day there was an ancient belief and it was widely held that if you died at sea, your soul never really rested because you were never buried physically.
[time=3075] And it may be that he's just trying to make sure that everybody knows whether you died on earth or whether you died on the ocean, you all get resurrected for this final judgment.
[time=3084] You're all a part of the defendants. You're all there. Nobody gets overlooked. Nobody gets left out. The manner of death is inconsequential.
[time=3090] It doesn't matter if you were burned to death or you blew up or you got eaten by a lion. It doesn't matter how you did it, you're all coming back and you're all standing before the same judge.
[time=3101] One theologian said it this way, the big sinners and the little sinners, rulers and subjects, nobles and plebians, the learned and the ignorant, the refined and the vulgar, the civilized and the barbarious, the emperors and beggars are all alike there.
[time=3113] Everybody's gathered and they are the great congregation of the unblessed.
[time=3119] Look at chapter 20 verse 6, back up a verse or two, "Blessed and holy is the one who has a part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death have no power, has no power.
[time=3131] But they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years." In other words, this first group we've been talking about, they're the congregation of the blessed.
[time=3142] But these defendants who get resurrected out of the sheol and hateys are the congregation of the unblessed. They are the congregation of the doomed and the damned.
[time=3151] They are the sinners of all the ages who refuse Christ, hated God, spurned his grace, despised his word, rejected his way, refused his grace, trampled his love.
[time=3162] One great doomed congregation of unblessed standing before God.
[time=3170] One of the charges, well they aren't really explicitly stated, "My guess is the glory of God. You have violated the glory of God."
[time=3183] What's the evidence? Look at verse 12. There are the books. The books were opened.
[time=3192] And another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged from the things written in the books according to their deeds.
[time=3199] Look at the end of verse 13. Every one of them according to their deeds. Guess what is in the books, folks?
[time=3207] What is written in these books is a very detailed account of all the sin, of all the unrighteous, of all the ages.
[time=3217] And they call the name of a sinner, and he stands there before God, and the books get open to the right place called his life, and there in front of God, and Christ, and all the witnesses, and all of us, and all the unsaved world.
[time=3231] Are read the deeds of sin and selfishness and lack of love of the unbelieving.
[time=3239] And God would much prefer to judge them on the basis of their faith in Christ, but they don't have any faith in Christ.
[time=3246] So all that's left to judge are their works, and their works reveal again and again there was no faith.
[time=3255] So they judged first for violations of commission, but then there is this sin of omission.
[time=3263] There is another book which was opened. It's the book of life. Look down at verse 15.
[time=3268] And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown in the lake of fire. These folks are judged not for what they did at this point before what they didn't do.
[time=3278] It's not just all their sinful deeds that send them to hell. It's the fact that they never accepted Christ. Therefore their name is not in the book of life.
[time=3286] So it's sins of commission and sin of omission that are being reviewed.
[time=3292] What is the verdict? Guilty. Guilty is charged. What is the sentence? Hell. The lake of fire. Forever and ever and ever.
[time=3305] I'll tell you what. It's going to be an embarrassing moment.
[time=3310] It's going to be an embarrassing moment. It's going to be standing there stripped absolutely naked in the presence of God.
[time=3316] And as we said, everybody else who ever lived and everything you've done is right there on the table.
[time=3326] Man, if you're here today and you don't know Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, you're headed for that moment.
[time=3339] The only way out of that moment is to have your name written in the Lamb's book of life, to come to Christ, to accept Him as your personal Lord and Savior, to admit your sinfulness, to admit all you've done that you can remember, that you've violated His law and accept His grace and forgiveness based upon His sacrificial death.
[time=3359] If that happens, your book is closed. All those sins are erased. They're gone. And when they open the book with the Lamb's book of life, they find your name right there. They say, "This guy's in. No judgment. Kingdom."
[time=3374] Well, I hope you don't let this opportunity go by. The Bible says that it's appointed for man to die once and then comes judgment. This is the judgment.
[time=3385] So there is this awesome courtroom scene. There is the courtroom, the judge, the defendants, the charges, the evidence, the verdict, and the sentence.
[time=3392] The eternal, unmitigating hell.
[time=3408] I hope that the Bible hour provided inspiration for you today as you listen to the music of our sanctuary choir, the men singers, and the duet from Sisters, Maryland, Wong, and Marsha Richard.
[time=3420] The message today was from our pastor, Teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3424] If as a result of today's program, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, or you have a need, I'd like to just pray for you right now. That's bowed together in prayer.
[time=3435] Dear Heavenly Father, I know that there are many people who are watching the Bible hour today who are ill, and we pray that you'll just intercede in their lives and heal their body if it's your will, or just give them strength to carry on.
[time=3448] There's anyone that needs to accept Jesus Christ as their Savior. We pray that they'll ask forgiveness today, and ask Jesus to come into their heart.
[time=3456] In Jesus name I pray, amen. If you prayed a prayer of repentance today, would you write us and tell us the nature of your decision. When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
