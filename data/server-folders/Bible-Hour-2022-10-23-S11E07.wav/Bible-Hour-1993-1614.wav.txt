[time=0] (audience chattering) But if you think that Sandy Padding,
[time=16] or Chuck Swindall, or Ronald Reagan, or Arnold Palmer, or Elvis Presley, have charisma, have the ability to light a crowd up.
[time=26] Wait until you get in the presence of God.

[time=651] [MUSIC]
[time=662] In letters of crimson, God wrote His love
[time=670] on a hillside, so long long ago.
[time=679] For you and for me, Jesus died
[time=688] and love's greatest story was told.
[time=700] I love you, I love you.
[time=709] That's what cover me so.
[time=717] I love you, I love you.
[time=729] I love you, that's in my name.
[time=739] [MUSIC]
[time=747] Down through the ages, God wrote His love
[time=755] with the same hands that suffered at night.
[time=765] Giving out that He had to give our message so easily.
[time=783] I love you, I love you.
[time=792] That's what cover me so.
[time=801] I love you, I love you.
[time=812] I love you.
[time=818] How precious is the flow that makes you wait us no longer.
[time=841] From time long, nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[time=853] I love you, I love you.
[time=863] That's what cover me so.
[time=871] I love you, I love you.
[time=882] That's what cover me so.
[time=912] A lot of ways to say you love somebody and then there's the ultimate way and that's to lay
[time=924] your life down for them.
[time=925] Thank you.
[time=926] Well, let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and let's go back to Revelation chapter 21 and we've come to the chapters in the book of Revelation that talk about heaven,
[time=938] the eternal state and just to help us get our minds kind of in focus and prepare to receive
[time=945] the material of this text, I just want to ask you a question to remember, the last time you were in the presence of a really famous person, a really famous person.
[time=955] Maybe you've had occasion to meet the president at some time or some great athlete or some phenomenal musician, but where you have been in their immediate presence.
[time=965] For me, I remember a time when I was at Moody Bible Institute there in Chicago, some years
[time=972] ago at that time I was in education out in California and I traveled to Chicago to visit Moody and find out what they were doing and learn from them.
[time=980] They have chapel there once a day, five days a week for about 30, 35 minutes and let me help you out.
[time=986] Chapel is not the most exciting thing.
[time=989] Students don't just wait with Bated Breath to bust down the doors and get into chapel.
[time=994] The day that I was there, they were because about a half hour to an hour before chapel was to start, word was leaked that Sandy Petty was on campus and she was doing some recording
[time=1005] things for the Radio Ministry of Moody Bible Institute and that the people had talked her in to singing in chapel and so the buzz just rippled through the entire campus and
[time=1017] a half an hour before chapel was to start, they had to lock the doors and people were literally lining up in droves, the students and administrators and teachers and everybody was excited and thrilled
[time=1029] and finally they opened the door and the place just packed instantly and there was the buzz of the excitement until finally she came out and she sang three or four numbers and did what she is so capable of doing, she lit the place up.
[time=1041] I mean her personal charisma and her giftedness just seemed to fill every nook and cranny of
[time=1047] the room and everybody there was somehow lifted to a different level all because she was
[time=1053] there and when I was over I was thinking the poor person who has to speak in chapel tomorrow, you know, I mean it's just going to be an average ordinary guy and it's going to be kind of an average ordinary chapel, it's interesting isn't it?
[time=1067] People have different levels of charisma.
[time=1070] We could think about a my memory at time when I was in chapel as a student at the at Talbot seminary and once again the same thing, okay, another chapel but Chuck Swindall was speaking
[time=1081] in chapel this week and so we were all hustling in there to get our very best seats and we just sat there mesmerized by this man with an unusual amount of charisma as he filled
[time=1092] our hearts with inspiration and thoughts of our God.
[time=1095] I remember at the end of this message I had to dream up some question that really wasn't a question but I made it up about his message so I had an excuse to go up and shake his hand and be face to face in the present, you know charisma, Ronald Reagan has it, there's
[time=1112] no question, Arnold Palmer has it, Schwarzkopf has it and it isn't really easy to define, it's
[time=1122] not necessarily physical appearance, it's not necessarily intelligence, it's not necessarily athletic ability, it's not necessarily some physical attribute, it's sometimes there's a combination of all of those and it's not that you're the best at anyone, I mean Elvis Presley for example, didn't have the world's best voice, Brian Loeson is better than Elvis
[time=1143] Presley in my mind, right amen, thank you, but you look at Elvis and everybody just swarmed,
[time=1154] the guy's been dead, they still trying to resurrect him, there was this charisma about the guy and it wasn't that he had the best voice or that he was the best looking individual that ever lived or was the best actor that ever graced the screen but it was this unique combination of stuff that allowed him to give his personality and his personhood and it just affected everybody
[time=1175] that was around him, well if you think that Ronald Reagan and Sandy Patty and Chuck
[time=1183] Swindall and Elvis Presley have charisma, wait until you get in the presence of God, you
[time=1193] are going to experience a personal magnetism and charisma that will satisfy your heart and
[time=1201] your soul for all of eternity and as a matter of fact that is what heaven is all about, being
[time=1213] in the immediate presence to where you are being affected and affected by the charisma
[time=1220] and the personal magnetism of the true and living guy, let me show that to you, let me
[time=1227] show that to you, Revelation chapter 21 and we're just going to take some time this morning developing that theme, Revelation 21 begins our understanding of heaven and it starts in
[time=1239] the first eight verses and it's talking specifically about the new heaven and the new earth and you
[time=1245] know that the present earth we happen to be living on is going to be destroyed, melted down, it goes away but then God reforms and reshapes a new heaven and a new earth, verse 1 of chapter
[time=1256] 21 because the first heaven and the first earth have passed away and there is no longer any sea, that's it, that's all we know about the new heaven and the new earth except verse 3,
[time=1268] behold the tabernacle of God is among men and he shall dwell among them and they shall be
[time=1275] his people and God himself shall be among them, now that's repetitious folks because it's
[time=1282] saying it from every possible direction, don't miss it, the theme is that God is among his people and his people are in his presence and you say what does that produce, look at verse 4, he's going to wipe away every tear from their eyes, no longer shall there be death, no longer shall there be mourning or crying or pain, the first things have passed away and other words to be in the immediate presence of God is to be so filled by his presence that
[time=1308] all of the hardship of life as we know it is immediately removed, the longings, the emptiness,
[time=1315] the sense of personal identity crisis, all the weaknesses that you know about about yourself
[time=1321] and try to protect and hide all of the insecurities, it's all just gone because God fills you with
[time=1328] the sense of his presence.
[time=1335] But interestingly and oftentimes the Bible doesn't answer the question but this time it does and the question is this, what is it about the presence of God that is so satisfying?
[time=1348] And chapter 21 verse 9 through verse 5 of chapter 22 give a basic answer to that question
[time=1355] and it boils down to this, the glory of God, the glory of God, look at it, chapter 21 verses
[time=1364] 10 and 11, he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, obviously a mountain
[time=1370] on this new heaven and this new earth and he showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down
[time=1377] out of heaven from God, having the glory of God, her brilliance was like a very costly stone
[time=1385] as a stone of crystal clear Jasper.
[time=1391] We learned about the new heaven and the new earth and we know all we're ever going to know about it, this side of heaven.
[time=1396] But then he goes to talk about the new Jerusalem which is this heavenly city which God has made
[time=1403] and it's pictured in your verses there descending out of the heavens to where it rests presumably
[time=1409] on the new heaven and the new earth.
[time=1413] And so we are going to find in this text a description of the new Jerusalem and the materials
[time=1419] out of which it was made, but I want you to realize the centerpiece of this city and every
[time=1425] city has a dominating theme, a centerpiece, even cities on earth today, they're known Hong Kong, the Jewel, Philadelphia, the city of love, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1435] This city has as its hallmark the very glory of God, verse 11, having the glory of God.
[time=1442] Her brilliance was like a costly stone, in other words the glory of God gives this city a remarkable brilliance.
[time=1450] Verse 23, "The city has no need of the sun, or the moon to shine upon it, why?
[time=1455] Because the glory of God has illumined it, and it's a lamp," or excuse me, "and its lamp
[time=1461] is the lamp, 22 verse 5, and there shall no longer be any night, and they shall not have
[time=1468] need of the light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun, why?
[time=1472] Because the Lord God shall illumine them." Now not just the city gets lit up in the vernacular of our day, but the people themselves turn into light bulbs because of the presence of the glory of God, so it's potent stuff.
[time=1490] But it can be ethereal, it can be hard to get a hold of, it can be hard to conceptualize,
[time=1496] and so today I want to give you three aspects of the glory of God, three aspects of the glory
[time=1502] of God.
[time=1503] One, it's impact on people in the past, we're going to go back for a few minutes into the Old Testament, and I want to show you what happens when God brings His glory to people in the Old Testament.
[time=1513] Number two, it's impact on people in the future.
[time=1516] We will return to Revelation 21 and 22, and I want to show you some things about the glory of God in the future, and it's impact on people in the future.
[time=1524] And then lastly I want to talk to you about its impact on you today.
[time=1529] The impact of the glory of God on you today.
[time=1534] First a definition, what is the glory of God?
[time=1536] It's very simple to this.
[time=1538] Glory of God is the manifestation of God in such a way that you can see Him or experience
[time=1545] Him, feel Him.
[time=1546] Now you say that's important, yes, because this, God is on my present, God is everywhere,
[time=1553] God has always been everywhere, and God will always be everywhere.
[time=1557] And His presence is always everywhere.
[time=1560] It is the glory of God, dogsah in the Greek, and kabah in the Hebrew.
[time=1565] That's a technical phrase or word that means this is the presence of God, it's everywhere, but He's going to give you a specific sense of it, either visually or through your experience
[time=1577] and through your emotions.
[time=1579] That's what lights up heaven.
[time=1581] It is this specific manifestation, either visually or experientially of the persons of God in a way totally different than His general omnipresence.
[time=1593] Okay, let's track it.
[time=1595] Number one, the impact of the glory of God on people in the past, Exodus chapter 24.
[time=1603] This is amazing.
[time=1604] If you've never seen this before, it just brings new meaning to thirsting after God, to hungry for God, and to knowing that God is the one who can satisfy the longings of your heart.
[time=1616] Exodus chapter 24, here we are in this scene at Mount Sinai, two million people have been
[time=1622] brought out of the land of Egypt through the miraculous plagues, which God brought upon the Pharaoh, and He brings them to Mount Sinai.
[time=1629] And we won't go there, just for background, Exodus 19, God shows up to Mount Sinai.
[time=1634] And if you've had any Sunday school classes or you've been in the church a little while, remember that God descends down on Mount Sinai in these clouds, and there's lightning and
[time=1644] there's thunder, and it's an absolutely horrifying experience.
[time=1648] They had to build boundaries around the base of Mount Sinai, because if you touch the mountain since God was on it, it would instantly kill you.
[time=1654] It was a very threatening moment.
[time=1655] And the people eventually said, "Don't talk to us anymore that way.
[time=1658] God speak to us through Moses." So God invites Moses up to this mountain.
[time=1666] This is just 24, verse 9, "Moses went up with Aaron, Nadeb, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders
[time=1674] of Israel.
[time=1677] And they saw the God of Israel.
[time=1680] And under his feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire as clear as the sky itself.
[time=1686] Yet, he did not stretch out his hand against the nobles of the sons of Israel.
[time=1693] And they beheld God, and they ate, and they drank." Guess what, folks?
[time=1700] They did not bring any food with them.
[time=1704] They did not bring any wine or any milk or any water to drink, and they brought no animals to sacrifice.
[time=1710] You say, "What are they eating and drinking?" They go up into the heaven where God is, they see Him, they see His glory, that He does not stretch out His hand against them, but they behold God, and they eat, and they drink.
[time=1725] They are eating and drinking, they are communing, they are feasting upon the person of God.
[time=1733] They were built for such a time, they are built in the image of God to have communion with God, and when they get up there at that moment, they are eating and drinking God.
[time=1743] It is as if to say they are finding full, quenching, and satisfaction of their thirst, and the full, complete, satisfying of the hunger in their soul for the person of God.
[time=1756] Well, they eventually depart the mountain, but Moses goes back up, verse 18, "And Moses entered the midst of the cloud as he went up to the mountain, and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights." Moses is the unique individual in the Old Testament who finds fellowship with God up on the mountain
[time=1774] for forty days and forty nights.
[time=1778] You want to know what they were talking about?
[time=1781] Come to chapter 33.
[time=1785] And you see here one of the most intimate pictures of relationship anywhere in the Bible.
[time=1792] Moses is pleading and seeking the person of God based upon the fact that God says that
[time=1799] I love you, Moses, and I even know you by name.
[time=1802] Now you are going to hear some these and those in this, try to fight your way through that.
[time=1807] My version has these.
[time=1808] Exodus 33, verse 12, "Moses said to the Lord, 'See thou dost say to me, bring up this people,
[time=1817] but thou thyself has not let me know whom thou wilt sinned with me.'"
[time=1823] Moreover, thou hast said, "I have known you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight." Moses is saying, "Look, you told me to leave these people out of here, but you haven't told me who is going with me.
[time=1833] But then, secondly, God, you have said you know me by name, and that I have found favor in your sight." I hope you understand what this is real, this is real intimacy going on here between Moses and God to say, "You know my name, and I have found favor." Those are very, very personal connotations.
[time=1852] Verse 13, "Now therefore I pray, if I have found favor in thy sight, let me know thy ways
[time=1858] that I may know thee so that I may find favor in thy sight."
[time=1864] Consider too that this nation is your people, and God said, "My presence shall go with you.
[time=1871] I will give you rest." Then He said to him, "If thy presence does not go with us, then do not lead us up from here.
[time=1879] For how can it be known that I have found favor in your sight and that we are your people?
[time=1885] Is it not by you are going with us so that we, I and thy people may be distinguished from
[time=1892] all the other people who are upon the face of the earth?" Verse 17, "And the Lord said, "Moses, I will also do this thing of what you have spoken.
[time=1902] For you have found favor in my sight, and I have known you by name."
[time=1908] And then verse 18, "Then Moses said, 'I pray thee, show me thy glory.'"
[time=1917] Let me see you again, like I saw you before when I was eating and drinking you.
[time=1923] When you were making me satisfied to the very core of my being, show me your glory."
[time=1931] Verse 19, God said, "I myself will make all my goodness past before you, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before you, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion." But he said, "You cannot see my face.
[time=1944] For no one can see me and live." Then the Lord said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand there on the rock.
[time=1953] And it will come about, while my glory is passing by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by, then I will take my hand away, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen."
[time=1968] Amazing, and God's going to grant the request for Moses to get a glimpse of the manifestation
[time=1974] of the person of God where he can see it and feel its impact.
[time=1978] But he can't see it face to face.
[time=1980] It's too much, so God graciously puts him in the cleft, puts his hand over it, and lets Moses sneak out and peek a look behind and see the afterglow of God's glory.
[time=1991] He's thirsting for it.
[time=1992] He's saying, "I've seen it before, I've sucked with it before.
[time=1995] Give me just one more chance to see it again." And he did.
[time=1999] It happened just as God said it would.
[time=2001] And you remember over in chapter 34, verse 29, 34, 29, it came about when Moses was coming
[time=2007] down from Mount Sinai, carrying with him the tablets of the testimony, the end of verse 29, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because of his speaking with
[time=2018] God.
[time=2019] Are you familiar?
[time=2022] Revelation 22 5 said, "God will illumine them in heaven, in the eternal state, in the New Jerusalem.
[time=2029] He'll bring his glory so fully and so completely.
[time=2032] We'll all turn into little Moses people, and we'll all, our faces will be shining and our bodies will be shining because we'll have been in the presence of God.
[time=2039] It will so completely impact us that we ourselves will emit the glory of God."
[time=2046] Verse 33, "When Moses had finished speaking with him, he had to put a veil over his face.
[time=2050] It was too distracting, too bright." Well, that's one example.
[time=2056] I wish I had time this morning to take you to several others in the New Testament, that show when you have opportunity to experience the manifestation of the person of God visually
[time=2068] or physically, it can be the most exciting, thrilling, satisfying moment in life.
[time=2075] In fact, the Revelation 21, let's see the impact of the glory of God on people in the future.
[time=2082] And those of you who are involved in building will appreciate this text.
[time=2088] First there's kind of a vision or a visual description of what the city's going to look like.
[time=2094] You've already seen it, begins in verse 10 of chapter 21.
[time=2096] He carried me away in the Spirit, the New Jerusalem, the Holy City came down from heaven.
[time=2101] They had the glory of God, well, the whole rest of this passage is going to describe what the glory of God looks like in a city.
[time=2109] First of all, her brilliance was like a very costly stone as a stone of crystal clear
[time=2117] jasper.
[time=2120] Jasper may be another word for diamond.
[time=2125] This city to your gaze looks like a brilliant shimmering diamond.
[time=2134] Verse 12.
[time=2135] It had a great high wall with 12 gates, and at the gates there were 12 angels, and the names
[time=2141] were written on them, which are those of the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel.
[time=2145] So this city has a wall, and in the wall there are 12 gates, and each gate is named after one of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
[time=2153] Verse 13.
[time=2154] There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
[time=2162] So it's obviously a square.
[time=2165] And the wall of the city had 12 foundation stones, and on them were the 12 names of the
[time=2171] 12 apostles.
[time=2172] So the Lord's kind of weaving into the architecture of the New Jerusalem, the Old Testament
[time=2178] saints as represented by the tribes of Israel, and the New Testament folks as represented by the names of the 12 apostles, and he's uniquely and marvelously fabricating the city to have spiritual meaning and connotation to those of us who love the Word of God, and who are a part of either the Old or the New Testament.
[time=2193] We belong.
[time=2194] There's a sense of our own ownership in this.
[time=2198] Verse 15.
[time=2199] And the one who spoke with me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, and its gates and its wall, and the city is laid out as a square, and its length is as great as its width.
[time=2210] So it's a square, and he measured the city with the rod, 1500 miles, its length, and its
[time=2217] width, and here's some additional information, and its height are equal.
[time=2220] What's that?
[time=2221] When you have something that is as wide as it is long, as it is high, you have a cube.
[time=2227] This cube is 1500 miles long, and 1500 miles deep, 1500 miles by the way is from the Atlantic
[time=2234] ocean to the Rockins, or from Maine to the tip of Florida.
[time=2237] 1500 miles this way, 1500 miles this way, and 1500 miles this way, a diamond, brilliant,
[time=2245] glimmering, shining with the glory of God.
[time=2250] And then around the city there's this wall, and in each side there's three gates, and
[time=2258] the gates are made of pearls.
[time=2263] But now he shifts.
[time=2264] Okay, there's your description.
[time=2265] You got it in your mind.
[time=2266] That's what the heavenly city looks like.
[time=2267] You want to say in yourself now, okay, what's coming down?
[time=2269] There is this glorious, brilliant diamond.
[time=2273] That's 1500 miles by 1500 miles by 1500 miles with a wall going around it with three gates
[time=2280] on each side.
[time=2281] Okay, I got it.
[time=2283] That's what's coming down.
[time=2286] What's it made out of?
[time=2287] Look at verse 18.
[time=2290] And the material of the wall was Jasper, a diamond.
[time=2294] So the wall is made out of a diamond.
[time=2297] And the city was pure gold.
[time=2300] The whole city now is gold, everything in the city, everything about the city, all the pipes, all the streets, all the walls, all the roofs, all the countertops, all the beds, whatever's in the city, it's all gold.
[time=2313] What kind of gold?
[time=2314] Look at verse 18.
[time=2315] It's like clear glass.
[time=2316] You say now wait a minute.
[time=2317] I have never seen gold like pure glass.
[time=2320] Exactly.
[time=2321] You've never been to heaven yet.
[time=2322] Can you get there?
[time=2323] That's the kind of gold they have.
[time=2324] All their gold is just like that.
[time=2326] They don't have any of that gold you can't see through.
[time=2329] All their gold, you see right through it.
[time=2332] Verse 19.
[time=2334] The foundation stones of the city were well, they were adorned with every kind of precious
[time=2340] stone.
[time=2341] Now think about this.
[time=2342] Remember, there are 12 foundation stones.
[time=2344] And on each foundation stone, there is first the name of an apostle.
[time=2349] Now also on this diamond foundation stone are a whole bunch of other expensive jewels,
[time=2355] verse 19.
[time=2356] They are decorated further with more diamonds and then sapphires and then calcidony and then emeralds and then sardox and I won't read the whole list but note this.
[time=2366] There are in the listing of these precious jewels which are studded into these gigantic
[time=2372] foundation stones of the city, every color of the rainbow.
[time=2377] This sky blue and green and red and white and just red and sea green and yellow green
[time=2384] and violet and purple.
[time=2388] So now stuck on these foundation stones are these other expensive jewels.
[time=2396] Look at verse 21.
[time=2398] And the 12 gates were 12 pearls and you think, oh yeah, I've heard about the pearly gates.
[time=2404] That means there's going to be these gates and there's going to be strings of pearls all up and down the gate.
[time=2409] No.
[time=2410] Look again, verse 21.
[time=2411] And the 12 gates were 12 pearls and then he emphasizes it.
[time=2415] Each one of the gates was a single pearl.
[time=2419] That's some pearl.
[time=2422] That's some oyster.
[time=2423] Tell me to think of it.
[time=2428] And then look, verse 21, and the street of the city was pure gold.
[time=2433] Where it is again, like transparent glass.
[time=2438] You say, okay, help me.
[time=2441] God didn't tell us the description of the city and the building materials of the city to make the builders and the congregation happy.
[time=2448] What's going on here?
[time=2449] Why?
[time=2450] Why the detail?
[time=2451] Tell me what this is about.
[time=2452] I want you to notice one salient feature about every single piece of building material
[time=2458] in the entire place.
[time=2459] It's all what, transparent.
[time=2464] It's all see-through.
[time=2466] It all transfers light.
[time=2469] Verse 11, in her brilliance, like a costly stone, crystal clear jasper, verse 18.
[time=2477] The material of the wall was jasper.
[time=2479] We assume the same crystal clear jasper, verse 18.
[time=2483] The city was pure gold.
[time=2484] What kind of gold?
[time=2485] All the kind of gold that's like clear glass.
[time=2488] Verse 21, with the exception of the pearls at the end of verse 21, the street of the city was pure gold like transparent glass.
[time=2497] You can see through the whole city, why?
[time=2500] Because this city has been built with one explicit purpose to allow the glory of God to
[time=2508] emanate from his person through every last little corner of the place and right on out
[time=2514] the city to the new heaven and the new earth.
[time=2519] This city has been built by design so that the glory of God will not have to bend around corners, fight its way up over wooden walls, no, it just pushes itself.
[time=2530] 1,500 by 1,500 by 1,500 brilliant dazzling diamond, with intersecting streets of gold.
[time=2537] And the glory of God is pushing light through the walls, through the foundation, and through the very colored stones of the foundation, emanating glorious streaks of the rainbow through
[time=2548] its own brilliance.
[time=2550] It's all energized and empowered and lit up by God Himself.
[time=2555] And so the city itself is built in such a way that He cannot be restrained in the brilliance
[time=2561] of His own glory.
[time=2562] In other words, you and I don't have to go around a corner to get back into the presence of God.
[time=2567] You and I don't have to ever find our way around some obstacle so we can again be in direct contact with the glory of God.
[time=2575] The whole thing is built to put it together.
[time=2578] Notice verse 22, again it says, "And I saw no temple in it for the Lord God, the Almighty
[time=2584] and the Lamb are its temple." There's no temple in the New Jerusalem.
[time=2588] Why?
[time=2589] Because the Lord God, the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
[time=2592] Interesting footnote here.
[time=2593] You don't catch it in the English, but the word temple there is actually the transliteration of the Hebrew word holy of holies.
[time=2600] Did you know that the holy of holies, that was protected by the veil and the high priest could only go in once a year to make a tombate for sin and in the holy of holies, the ark of the covenant and the glory of God sat above the ark, above the seraphim?
[time=2614] Guess what its dimensions were?
[time=2615] It happened to have been a cube, 20 by 20 by 20.
[time=2621] It's almost as if God is saying, "Now we've got a whole new holy of holies going on here and it's not 20 by 20 by 20, it's 1500 by 1500 by 1500 and by the way, there are no
[time=2632] veils.
[time=2633] I've replaced all the veils with transparent gold so that you can see completely into the
[time=2640] holy of holies and so that what I am in the holy of holies can emanate completely into your heart." It's an awesome picture.
[time=2648] God is making all things new.
[time=2650] Sin has been resolved, Satan has thrown away, all the unredeemed are locked up and imprisoned in the lake of fire, there is only the redeemed and there are only the perfected holy angels and God himself and so it's a perfect environment in which God's glory can move in and through as it wills.
[time=2666] Verse 23, "And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shine upon it, the old
[time=2672] Testament prophet Isaiah said of this moment that the sun and the moon will shrink back from the glory of God.
[time=2679] His person is so charismatic.
[time=2681] He has such a magnetism about him that when he shows it in physical form, the power of the light of the glory of God causes the moon and the sun to shrink back and embarrassment.
[time=2692] They will be no more, no new one will be created, there will be no need of it.
[time=2697] God's person will light it up." Verse 24 to 27, "And talk about human glory, and the nations shall walk by its light and
[time=2705] the kings of the earth shall bring their glory unto it." I believe that means the kings who were alive during our period of time in normal human history who were believers and who come to the heavenly city, they will come to bring what little human glory they had and throw it at his feet.
[time=2722] Verse 25, "And in the daytime for there shall be no night there." Why?
[time=2727] Because God is always glorious.
[time=2729] He never turns off.
[time=2731] Its gates shall never be closed.
[time=2733] Verse 26, "And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it." So in other words, all the rest of us, a part of the every tribe, nation and tongue that got redeemed, will bring our measly little glory because we do have our own sense of charisma and we'll lay that at his feet.
[time=2749] Everything is put in subordination to the glorious glory of God.
[time=2755] Verse 27, "Nothing unclean and no one who practices abomination and lying shall ever come into it, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life." You see, now you left out the part about the pearls.
[time=2767] How come the pearls aren't said to be transparent?
[time=2770] I mean, if you can change the composition of gold, why did he change the composition of a pearl?
[time=2774] Frankly, I don't know.
[time=2776] But I can't tell you this.
[time=2778] Interesting little parallel between a pearl and heaven.
[time=2782] Think of it this way, to enter the heavenly city, to get into this new Jerusalem, you've got to go through a gate.
[time=2787] And the gate has a huge pearl as its gate and it's always open.
[time=2791] In order to get in, you've got to go through a pearl.
[time=2794] The allegory is this, heaven is entered through suffering and travail.
[time=2799] You and I get into heaven through the suffering and the travail of our blessed Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=2804] It was the redemption of his own blood, so much was the travail.
[time=2809] A pearl is made by a little animal that is wounded, without a wound, no pearl.
[time=2817] We enter into heaven by gates of pearls made by a wounded redeemer.
[time=2825] Maybe that's why God did it that way.
[time=2827] Maybe God wants us every time we frequent the holy city.
[time=2829] Every time we come from wherever we've been in the new heaven and the new earth, and we come back from whatever purpose to the new Jerusalem, maybe he wants us to enter again through the pearl and be reminded of the sacrifice of Christ that makes the whole thing possible
[time=2845] for us.
[time=2846] I don't know you can't be sure.
[time=2850] Well quickly, let's go on, Revelation 22.
[time=2853] Now you're going to find here a river, a river of water, the river of water of life.
[time=2859] And guess what?
[time=2860] It's clear as crystal too.
[time=2862] And coming from the throne of the Lamb, then verse 2, "In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river was the tree of life bearing twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
[time=2877] You say, "Why is there a river coming out of the throne of God?
[time=2880] Are we going to be physically thirsty?" Then why is there a tree?
[time=2882] Do we eat of its fruit?
[time=2885] Well, again, it's hard to tie this down, but to my way of thinking, what you've got here is a symbol.
[time=2891] You've got a river coming out of the throne of God.
[time=2894] And right next to it, you've got a tree that produces all the kinds of fruit you can ever want to eat, and my mind goes back to Exodus 24, with Moses and they dab in a bayou in the seventy elders, and what were they doing in the glory of God?
[time=2906] They were eating, and they were drinking.
[time=2909] To me, though we may not drink of the river or eat of the tree itself, it stands there as a constant reminder that we are now the privileged to be in the glory of God, and we eat, and
[time=2920] we drink to our hearts content, until we are totally satisfied, not with a river, and
[time=2926] not with a tree, but with Him.
[time=2929] He's the one.
[time=2931] I remember the day when I needed water, and I remember the day when I needed fruit.
[time=2937] No, not anymore.
[time=2940] I just need Jesus, and He always fills me up.
[time=2947] I don't know.
[time=2948] I can't be sure.
[time=2950] Look at verse three.
[time=2952] "I shall no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and
[time=2958] his bond servant shall serve him." Now watch first for, and they shall see his face.
[time=2967] Something happens when we get glorified, whereas before if Moses would have looked upon the face of God, he would have been consumed.
[time=2975] It would have killed him.
[time=2976] It would have wiped him out of existence, but now because of salvation and because of Christ, both Moses and Old Testament saints in their glorified bodies, and you and I in our glorified bodies, will be able not just to look at the afterglow of God's glory, but to stand right in front of Him and see His face and drink it up, will get the full blast
[time=2997] of His glory." And then again, verse five, "There shall no longer be any night, and they shall not have need of the light of a lamp, nor the light of the sun, because the Lord shall illumine them."
[time=3013] Amazing grace.
[time=3014] Remember that last thing.
[time=3015] When we've been there 10,000 years doing what?
[time=3021] Bright shining as the, it's good theology, good theology in that hymn.
[time=3026] We will be bright shining as the sun, we will be bright shining as the sun, for we will
[time=3033] be in the unmitigated presence of God.
[time=3036] So you say, "Now that's okay, that's what the glory of God did for people in the past."
[time=3042] I see what the glory of God is going to do for people in the future, but could you tell me what the glory of God is supposed to do for me today?
[time=3051] Well, one more passage is, we close Hebrews chapter 11, Hebrews chapter 11, turn there
[time=3060] with me.
[time=3061] Chapter 11, don't miss the opportunity to see what the glory of God can do for you today.
[time=3073] Verse 8, "By faith, Abraham, when he was called obeyed by going out to a place which he
[time=3085] was to receive for an inheritance, and he went out, not knowing where he was going." Remember, Abraham was living a very happy life in the land of Er, and somehow, we don't know how, God spoke to him and said, "You follow me, I'm going to give you the promised land, I'm going to give you the Jerusalem that exists now, I'm going to give you the whole land of Canaan.
[time=3105] I want you to have it, and with it I'm going to give you an inheritance, more children than you can count." So Abraham embraced the words of God by faith and left Er and went, didn't know where it was going, but he was following God.
[time=3118] Verse 9.
[time=3119] He got there, he made it to the promised land.
[time=3122] By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise.
[time=3127] As in a foreign land dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob fellow heirs of the same promise
[time=3134] to point is he never owned any more land in the promised land than a grave site for Sarah.
[time=3141] That was the extent of his ownership of the land which God had promised to him.
[time=3144] He never owned it.
[time=3146] He lived his entire life as an alien and as a stranger in a foreign land.
[time=3151] You say, "Why did he do that?
[time=3154] Why didn't he turn around and go back to the land of Er?"
[time=3160] Verse 10.
[time=3163] Because he was looking for the city which has foundations.
[time=3168] We know about those, don't we?
[time=3169] Their diamond foundation studied with the very colored, precious jewels who built it, whose
[time=3176] architect and builder is God.
[time=3180] Do you understand the point?
[time=3184] Abraham lived as a stranger and an alien on this land following by faith the commands of
[time=3190] God.
[time=3191] He was, he is noted as having been a remarkably obedient servant of God.
[time=3196] Even though he didn't get all that was promised to him on this earth.
[time=3205] But he was willing to stay obedient and he was willing to sacrifice and he was willing to live as an alien and a stranger in a foreign land.
[time=3213] Which by the way Peter tells us to do, right?
[time=3216] We're supposed to live as strangers and aliens in this present day.
[time=3224] Because in Abraham's case, he was so convinced and we don't know where he learned about it.
[time=3228] There's no record of it.
[time=3230] The splendor and the glory of heaven that he was willing to live without the stuff he wanted
[time=3236] today because he knew in heaven God would completely, totally satisfy the longings of his heart.
[time=3242] The glory of God can do that for you today.
[time=3247] As you set your passion and as you set your heart and as you just immerse your mind in
[time=3256] the truth of what awaits you in heaven, not streets of gold, not diamonds, not pearls,
[time=3262] him, and what he will do when he lights you up and when he strips from you every sense of
[time=3271] sin and insecurity and loneliness and emptiness when he strips it all out of your life and he
[time=3277] fills you with his own glory and you begin to glow with it so completely immersed by it, are you?
[time=3285] There's real power in that to say, "Hey, you know what, I'm willing to live as a stranger and an alien today and to live as an ambassador for Christ because I know when I get to heaven."
[time=3298] Everything's taken care of.
[time=3302] You know, of all the generations that have ever lived on the planet of the earth, one thing for sure can be said about our generation.
[time=3307] You know what it is?
[time=3308] We may not be the brightest, we may not be the strongest.
[time=3313] But we are without question, the one generation who has known instant gratification more than
[time=3320] any other generation who has ever lived.
[time=3325] We do instant breakfast, we do microwave, we do instant telephone conversations all around
[time=3331] the world, we do faxes, we do flying, I mean, we get it and we get it now and if we don't get it now, we don't like it.
[time=3338] You see, that is the opposite of Christianity.
[time=3343] Christianity is all about getting it later.
[time=3348] Christianity is all about living right now for the purposes of God in your life, regardless of how it makes you feel, regardless of where it takes you in society, regardless of what it produces in your personal happiness quotient because we are committed to delayed gratification.
[time=3367] You see, well, so I hope as you go to work in the morning, as you work with your children,
[time=3377] as you make your choices, you are armed with a view of heaven and the promise of heaven,
[time=3383] of delayed gratification, to look at the thousand messages a second that we get that we are
[time=3389] supposed to be living for today and say, "Not so, not so.
[time=3393] I'm going to focus on loving my wife and loving my kids and serving my church and studying
[time=3399] the Word of, I'm going to do things that may not produce instant gratification.
[time=3402] I'm going to, as the song said, I'm going to lay my life down for people, which I've always understood to be a pretty painful process because I know what's coming, heaven.
[time=3417] While we come to the close of another Bible hour presentation, I hope you enjoyed the music by our chapel choir, Brian Loseon and Lynn Roll.
