[time=0] (audience member speaking off mic) If I really believe the forecast,
[time=13] what kind of a commitment am I going to make in light of that forecast?
[time=20] You're gonna get 25% of my life?
[time=29] Or am I so confident that this forecast is true and accurate?
[time=34] You're gonna get all my life.
[time=37] (upbeat music) Welcome to the Bible Hour,

[time=67] Are you ready?
[time=68] We'll be studying from the book of Revelations, chapter 22, verses six through 22.
[time=74] Our special music today will be provided by Kevin Rowe and Margie Isaacson.
[time=88] Let's join our chamber choir as they begin our service.

[time=600] (audience clapping)
[time=608] - Thank you again for tuning in to The Bible Hour.
[time=614] I hope that your summer has been very good for you a restful time and anticipation of the fall of the year.
[time=621] I wanna say a special thank you as I talk to you for our Bible Hour staff.
[time=626] I'm grateful for Ed Richard, our coordinator of The Bible Hour.
[time=629] You don't see him very often, but he's responsible for all of the work that goes on in producing The Bible Hour.
[time=636] And then from time to time you receive letters that are typed by Marge Mead, our Bible Hour Secretary.
[time=642] She's so faithful.
[time=643] So conscientious about your prayer request.
[time=646] She lets me know that they came in and we sit together and pray for those requests.
[time=651] And I'm grateful for both of these people.
[time=653] And then we have some 30 volunteers from our church that come every Sunday morning, a little after 730, get the cameras ready, prepare for The Bible Hour.
[time=663] And I'm just so thankful that they've chosen the ministry of The Bible Hour.
[time=668] Just recently I gave a report to our board and we suggested through an arbitrarian rating of the television station that there were between 11,000 and 14,000 people watching The Bible Hour, that's households watching The Bible every Sunday morning.
[time=685] And then the Founders Club.
[time=686] Many of you that watch our members of The Founders Club and I'm really grateful that you continually to give $15 or more every month to support our ministry.
[time=696] We're thankful that we just finished the fiscal year in the black and we've begun a new year.
[time=701] We're looking for 25 new members to The Founders Club this year.
[time=706] If you're watching and you'd like to know more information about it, you can write to The Bible Hour and in a moment I'll give you the address.
[time=712] I hope that you'll become involved as a prayer partner and a financial supporter of The Bible Hour this year.
[time=719] And just before we go back, I want to tell you about a book entitled "What Every Christian Should Know About Growing." Here's a book on discipleship.
[time=728] If you're a new Christian or you have a friend that's a new Christian, here's a step-by-step way that they can grow in the Lord.
[time=735] We'd like to offer it to you this month on The Bible Hour.
[time=738] And you can receive it by writing to The Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=749] Once again, what every Christian should know about growing, a book you can receive by simply asking for it and writing to The Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=764] By the way, that's the same address.
[time=766] If you'd like information about becoming a Founder's Club member, we'd be delighted to send you information and how you can join with us in this vital ministry.
[time=776] (gentle music)
[time=789] [MUSIC - 48 seconds]
[time=843] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 182 seconds]
[time=1033] Thank you.
[time=1044] (audience applauding)
[time=1055] Thank you, Margie.
[time=1057] Well, let's take our Bibles this morning and do what we always do at this time and turn to the book of Revelation chapter 22.
[time=1067] And we come this morning to the last message in our study of the book of Revelation, the last 16 verses.
[time=1073] After this, I think we'll spend the remainder of the summer in some topical messages.
[time=1080] And then as we head towards fall, we'll probably move back into another book of the New Testament and continue our study of God's Word in that expository fashion.
[time=1089] But as we come to the text this morning, let me do a little supposing with you.
[time=1093] Suppose for a minute that you had $10,000 that you were looking to invest.
[time=1099] Not a bad way to start the morning, is it?
[time=1101] Just an extra 10,000 laying around thinking, "Hmm, what do I want to do with this?" And you think about that for a minute and you say, "Well, real estate would be nice, but 10,000 probably isn't enough to do the kinds of things that need to be done in that category." I certainly don't want to leave it in the bank.
[time=1117] I mean, the interest there is so low, no risk, but hardly any return.
[time=1122] And you talk to a good friend of yours about what you might do and he recommends stock.
[time=1128] Why don't you buy some stock with your $10,000?
[time=1131] And you say, "Well, I don't know much about stock, which stock should I buy?" And he recommends a biomet.
[time=1137] And many of you know that biomet is located over here in Warsaw, Indiana, along with the other major orthopedic companies in the world.
[time=1143] It's the orthopedic capital of the world, Warsaw, Indiana.
[time=1147] And you say, "Well, why biomet?" And he says, "Well, it's a relatively new company and it's shown remarkable growth and innovation and leadership and its stock has been rising and they're showing incredibly fantastic, quarterly returns." Now, the stock was at 30 and it's just dropped to nine and so it's a tremendous time to get back in and make some money on this stock.
[time=1173] What basically would you leave that conversation with?
[time=1177] But if you're like me, you're going to leave with two basic questions that you've got to answer before you're going to put your money there.
[time=1183] One, do I really think that this stock is going to go up
[time=1190] in value?
[time=1190] Do I believe the forecast?
[time=1192] Do I believe this guy?
[time=1194] Do I really think it's going to go up in value?
[time=1197] If you get a yes to that, maybe you're going to get a half a yes or a sort of a yes or maybe you're just going to feel completely free in your heart to believe that.
[time=1205] The next question is how much of my 10,000 am I going to commit to bio-med, right?
[time=1210] Before I make a commitment, I got to have some sense of peace or certainty or a reasonable risk that where I'm headed that the forecast is reliable.
[time=1221] And depending upon how reliable I think the forecast is and as I study it from other angles, then we'll come the level of commitment I'm willing to give in that direction.
[time=1231] It's the exact same thing with the book of Revelation.
[time=1235] This is the exact line of reasoning that John is giving us as we approach the book of Revelation.
[time=1241] What you have in front of you in the book of Revelation is a forecast.
[time=1245] It's a prediction.
[time=1248] It's a description of what is yet to come, the future, how the world is going to end.
[time=1253] And it happens to predict the end of the world in rather derogatory terms.
[time=1257] There are going to be plagues and famine and war and death that are going to affect first a third of the world population and a half of the world's population.
[time=1267] And following that, and in the midst of that will come a great world ruler called the Annie Christ.
[time=1273] He will create a false sense of world peace, but he'll shatter it as God brings judgment and by his own evil heart and the whole thing ends up in the Battle of Armageddon and then the end of the world and then judgment, all eternity is predicted in this book.
[time=1288] It's a forecast, telling you where everybody's going to spend forever, depending upon what they do with the person of Christ.
[time=1293] But the two questions that face the investor in biomet face
[time=1302] you this morning, do I really believe the forecast?
[time=1308] And if I do, what changes am I willing to make?
[time=1314] To what degree am I willing to commit the way I live today to the premise of the forecast?
[time=1319] And insightfully, in these last 16 verses,
[time=1326] John addresses that fundamental question.
[time=1328] You see, he has not written for our fascination.
[time=1331] He has not written so that we can have some thrilling times together to think about how it might end.
[time=1339] He's driving us to the conclusion that we should live differently because, in fact, that is how it's going to end.
[time=1346] And so he kind of draws that to conclusion for us this morning.
[time=1349] Look at the theme of these last 16 verses.
[time=1351] You'll see it repeated four different times.
[time=1353] Chapter 22, verse 7, "Behold, I am coming quickly." That's, in other words, Christ is coming back.
[time=1361] I.e., everything you've read about in this book is going to happen because it all happens when He comes back.
[time=1366] Verse 12, "Behold, I am coming quickly and my reward is with me to render to every man according to what he has done." Verse 17, "And the spirit and the bride say, come, and let the one who hears say, come, and let the one who is thirsty come, and let the one who wishes take of the water of life without cost." Again, a fourth time in verse 20, "He who testifies to these things says, 'Yes, I am coming quickly.'" Amen, come Lord Jesus.
[time=1400] We've already known.
[time=1401] We've spent the whole book describing and learning and studying what happens when He comes.
[time=1406] But the end of the book is a reaffirmation in four different parts of this remaining 16 verses, "I am coming." And the two questions are, do you believe it?
[time=1420] And what are you willing to commit?
[time=1423] What out of your life are you willing to give in a lot of the fact that you do believe that I am coming?
[time=1430] So as of the first question, do you really believe that Christ is coming back?
[time=1434] Look at verse 6.
[time=1435] Now we'll kind of look at the text under those two questions.
[time=1438] Is He really coming back?
[time=1439] And secondly, if He is, what do you want from Me?
[time=1441] What's the appropriate response?
[time=1442] So the first question is He really coming back, verse 6.
[time=1445] And He said to me, "These words are faithful and true." And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent His angel to show to His bond servants the things which must shortly take place.
[time=1458] That's your answer.
[time=1459] Should I really believe the forecast?
[time=1462] Should I believe my investment counselor?
[time=1465] Well, who is He?
[time=1465] He is the Lord God.
[time=1467] And He is saying to you that His words are faithful and true.
[time=1471] Maybe in the early 70s, you bought along with four million other people.
[time=1475] One of Edgar Wysenot's books entitled 88 Reasons Why Jesus Is Coming Back in 1988.
[time=1482] Now I won't embarrass you and have you raise your hand.
[time=1484] But that was kind of the late great planet earth era, the howl-inzy, the hyperattention to the details of the book of Revelation to try to predict exactly when He was going to come back.
[time=1495] And Edgar wrote this book and sold four million copies of it.
[time=1499] 88 Reasons Why Jesus Is Coming Back in 1988.
[time=1504] Well, guess what he did in 1899.
[time=1506] In 1989, Edgar wrote another book called 88 Reasons Why Jesus Is Coming Back in 1989.
[time=1513] He has stopped writing books.
[time=1516] And the whole notion of the book, thankfully.
[time=1518] And the whole notion behind the book of Revelation is not to be able to predict the moment or the hour that Christ is coming back.
[time=1525] That was never the intent.
[time=1526] The intent is this.
[time=1528] He is coming back.
[time=1530] These are some broad, brush, general descriptions of what it will be like when He comes back.
[time=1539] But be certain of this one thing.
[time=1543] History will end when Christ comes back.
[time=1546] And He is coming back.
[time=1547] And you can bank on that not because of men like Edgar with an responsibility to comb through the book and find little interesting points of parallel with contemporary culture.
[time=1557] But because God Himself has written the book of Revelation.
[time=1560] And then He affirms it at the end of the book by saying, my words are faithful and true.
[time=1566] This is coming from the God who cannot lie.
[time=1568] This is coming from Christ who said in Matthew 24, "Though heaven and earth may pass away, my words will never pass away." Whatever you find by way of comfort and peace and security and solidarity in the heavens and the earth, the terra firma, the stuff we're sitting on right now, whatever level or degree of trust you can put in the solidarity and the permanence and the reliability of the earth.
[time=1594] Jesus says this, that stuff may pass away, but my words will never pass away.
[time=1600] What I say happens happens.
[time=1602] You can count on it.
[time=1604] You say, is there any historical precedence for this?
[time=1607] Well, just check God's record and see.
[time=1609] It happens to be perfect.
[time=1611] God said Adam and Eve would die and they did.
[time=1616] God said the world would perish by water and it did.
[time=1620] God said Babylon, the great would fall and it did.
[time=1624] God said Tyre would fall and it did.
[time=1628] God said Messiah would come and he did.
[time=1631] God said Christ would be born of a virgin and he was.
[time=1634] That Christ would be born in Bethlehem and he was.
[time=1637] That Christ would be crucified and he was.
[time=1640] That Christ would rise from the dead and he was.
[time=1642] Everything that God has said would transpire has transpired
[time=1648] and market his future record will be just as accurate as his record in the past.
[time=1654] In the future he is saying that the world will be hit with physical disturbances and plagues and famine and disease like it has never been hit before and it will.
[time=1666] He is saying that the nations of the world will assemble for war in the Battle of Armageddon and they will.
[time=1671] He is saying that the any Christ is coming to deceive the world and he is.
[time=1677] God is saying that believers will be martyred in the tribulation and they will be.
[time=1683] And most importantly, God is saying that Christ is coming back to rule and to reign and he is.
[time=1691] There is absolutely no basis upon which to question the truthfulness or the faithfulness of the words of God.
[time=1699] The Bible is full of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of prophecies that have already been fulfilled exactly as the Word of God has said they will be.
[time=1709] There is no reason to question God's Word.
[time=1712] Only a fool would question God's Word.
[time=1714] In fact, back to the Biomed example, if you could find an investor and an investment analyst and advisor who had the track record of God that is revealed in the Word of God, lands.
[time=1728] He would be the only investment analyst in the world.
[time=1733] That's how good he'd be.
[time=1736] Nobody listened to anybody else.
[time=1738] Listen to Isaiah 46, nine.
[time=1742] Remember the former things long passed?
[time=1745] I am God, there is no other.
[time=1747] I am God and there was no one like me.
[time=1750] Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times things which have not been done saying my purpose will be established and I will accomplish all my good pleasure calling a bird of prey from the east, the man of my purpose from a far country, truly I have spoken, truly I will bring it to pass.
[time=1771] I have planned it, surely I will do it.
[time=1775] You say why should I put my faith?
[time=1779] Why should I put my trust?
[time=1781] Why should I put my confidence in the fact that Christ is coming back?
[time=1785] Simply and completely because God has said it.
[time=1788] In 2 Peter 3, we read of the patience and the long suffering of God.
[time=1794] He is long suffering and patient not bringing the destruction of the end of the age in the hopes that many would come to repentance.
[time=1801] But don't as the mockers do ever mistake his patience and his long suffering for an inability to act.
[time=1808] The fact that he has not destroyed the world to date is no indication that he is unable to do that.
[time=1815] It is rather an indication that he is patient and he is long suffering, wishing and waiting for people to repent.
[time=1822] One theologian of man by the name of Sice says it this way, wonderfully, quote, "People may account us crazy for giving so much attention to the revelation.
[time=1831] They may laugh at our credulity for daring to believe that it means what it says.
[time=1836] But better be accounted possessed as Christ himself was considered and be pronounced mad after the manner of Paul that it take our lot with Pharisees and Festices and agrippas and galleos.
[time=1849] If we err, in this we err with the goodly fellowship of the saints with the noble army of the martyrs in the society of many great and good and wise, in many nations and many ages.
[time=1860] But we believe it is God who tells us these words are faithful and true.
[time=1865] Therefore, we so take them and build our faith upon them and testify them to all the world.
[time=1872] [AMEN] That is the spirit of these closing chapters, these closing verses.
[time=1879] It is a bold, radical commitment of life and heart, now and in all eternity to the veracity or the truthfulness or the reliability of what we have just been studying in the book of Revelation.
[time=1891] It is all going to happen exactly as God has said it will.
[time=1896] And that is the foundation of our faith, the Word of God.
[time=1902] However, for a moment this morning, let me give you four evidences, or you may call them apologetics, four interesting developments that lend credence to the Word of God.
[time=1920] Not to replace our faith in the Word of God itself and alone, but just to bolster our faith.
[time=1925] Let me give you four little footnotes.
[time=1926] Number one, foot number one.
[time=1929] In order for Christ to come back, in order for the events described in the book of Revelation to occur, there must be a geographically and politically identifiable Israel.
[time=1939] Israel must be back in the land.
[time=1941] Israel must be back in the land that God promised her in Genesis chapter 12, verses one through three.
[time=1946] And she must be a nation politically identifiable for it is the antichrist who will make packs with her as a nation.
[time=1953] And you understand that in AD 70, the great Roman general Titus and his legions of Roman army came into the area of Jerusalem and destroyed the city, they absolutely wiped it out and evicted all of its inhabitants.
[time=1968] And from that point in history, you could look at 300 AD or 600 AD or you could look in the middle ages or the 18th century or the 19th century and you could look at the land of Israel and you would not find the people of Israel there politically identifiable.
[time=1984] They did not have possession of the land through all those hundreds of years, through all those centuries they were scattered to the four corners of the earth.
[time=1993] But in 1948, 1,878 years after the destruction of Rome by Titus, the Jewish nation was reestablished in the land
[time=2006] that was originally given to Abraham in Genesis 12.
[time=2009] And they have been there since that date.
[time=2011] So it has only been since 1948 that the nation of Israel
[time=2018] was back in the land and would be in the proper place for the antichrist to do what is predicted of him in the book of Revelation.
[time=2026] Secondly, another footnote.
[time=2028] There will be temple sacrifices occurring
[time=2034] at the beginning of the tribulation.
[time=2036] We know that because as we read the book of Daniel, in Daniel chapter 9 verse 27, the antichrist, it says there, he puts a stop to the sacrifices halfway through the tribulation.
[time=2047] Tribulations three years, excuse me, six years long.
[time=2050] Halfway would be three and a half years, excuse me three years.
[time=2053] Seven year tribulation, three and a half years is the midpoint.
[time=2056] The obvious implication is that the sacrifices have been ongoing through the first half of the tribulation.
[time=2062] People say, well, we're in trouble on that one because the dome of the rock, how are we gonna get that back?
[time=2067] How are we gonna have the Jewish nation get back, the prized possession and real estate on which they could build their temple, and then inside that temple begin to perform their sacrifices.
[time=2076] Major problem, not really.
[time=2079] If you'll read the book of Nehemiah, you'll find that when the people returned from exile in Babylon, they came back to the promised land and did not yet have the temple built, but that did not stop them from making sacrifices on the altar, they just built an altar and their Levites began the sacrificial system.
[time=2095] It does require Levites.
[time=2098] And you may be interested to know that if you were to go to Israel today, you could find the constant conscientious training of the Levites every single day of the week, to save the Holy Day.
[time=2109] They are there, they are in place, they are trained, and with the direction of the nation to begin the sacrificial system instantly.
[time=2116] You also might interest you to know that in 1983,
[time=2123] Professor Asher Kaufman of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, wrote an article in Biblical Archaeological Review, which is indicating that the site of the Holy of Holies, which would be necessary to be found in order to reconstruct the millennial temple, that that site may in fact not be under the dome of the rock.
[time=2143] And there is a preponderance of archaeological evidence that that site is 100 yards the other direction, which is unoccupied and available.
[time=2152] And all that is left is for them to fully and formally conclude that, in fact, the location of the Holy of Holies is not under the dome of the rock, but is this at this point 100 yards north, and they can build their temple.
[time=2168] However, it wouldn't be required.
[time=2170] They could start the sacrificial system without it.
[time=2172] The third footnote that I find interesting.
[time=2175] As you know, the Word of God, in Daniel 2 and Daniel 7, indicates a Roman confederacy of some 10 nations.
[time=2183] A 10 nation, a revived Roman empire, having gone through all the ages and all the centuries, the book of Daniel indicates that at the end of the age, it will be a Roman confederacy of 10 nations that will rise up officially and formally under the leadership of the Antichrist against the nation of Israel.
[time=2200] And you know, as well as I know, you just look in your newspaper and you read the development of the European market and the confederation of nations.
[time=2209] They now call it the United States of Europe.
[time=2213] And all there has to be is a reconfiguration or a reassigning of the nations until they come up with the number of 10, which as we have noted in recent years, in our political environment, we have seen the changing and the shifting and the directing of nations happen overnight in a way that is totally unusual and uncommon in the rest of history.
[time=2232] A fourth footnote.
[time=2236] And I find this one especially interesting.
[time=2239] Three different times.
[time=2241] The New Testament talks about the end of the age with this little phrase, the whole world.
[time=2249] Eucaminesus in the Greek, the whole world.
[time=2252] Matthew 24/14, Jesus says this about the end of the age.
[time=2256] The gospel shall be preached to the whole world.
[time=2260] In Revelation three, it says there the hour of testing, meaning the great tribulation, is about to come upon Eucaminesus, the whole world.
[time=2272] Revelation 16 verse 14, speaking about the unclean spirits, they will move into the world and bring the kings of, quote, the whole world together for war.
[time=2285] You see, what's the significance of this word?
[time=2287] The whole world.
[time=2288] Well, if you read John Nezbets' books, Megatrend, and then Megatrend's 2000, you would have found that one of his major trends in both of those books was the notion of a global neighborhood, the movement from a national economy to a global economy.
[time=2309] Prior to World War II, the notion of a global neighborhood was foreign and inconceivable, and nobody even thought in those terms.
[time=2319] And yet, the word of God is saying that an undeniable characteristic of the end of the age is a global neighborhood.
[time=2328] The world will be treated as one.
[time=2330] The whole world will be impacted by things all at once.
[time=2336] Now, since World War II, we have global everything.
[time=2339] We have global information through computers.
[time=2342] We have global communications through satellites.
[time=2345] We have global transportation through the jet aircraft.
[time=2348] We have global economics.
[time=2350] And if you don't think so, just watch the ripple from the stock exchanges in Tokyo, to New York, to London.
[time=2355] We have global interdependence on food and fuel.
[time=2360] If you don't think so, ask the people who live in Kuwait and watch the whole world, the greatest unifying effort of the United Nations and its history to protect and to preserve the global dependence upon oil, and not allow that to come under one man's control.
[time=2375] Global dependence on food.
[time=2378] We don't think of a national food supply anymore.
[time=2381] We are talking about an international food supply.
[time=2384] And we are talking about global warming.
[time=2389] And the whole issue of whether or not the planet can stay cool enough to last.
[time=2392] And what are all the nations of the world.
[time=2395] And what are the international laws that need to be instituted to keep the thing from heating up?
[time=2399] This is new.
[time=2402] Were we to talk like this 300 years ago, people would be saying, you're nuts.
[time=2408] What are you talking about?
[time=2410] We are the first generation ever to live on the planet under the idea of globality.
[time=2415] And it is a characteristic mark.
[time=2418] It's undeniable.
[time=2420] It is a part of the end of the age.
[time=2423] So is that why I believe in the book of reality?
[time=2425] No, that's not why I believe in the revelation.
[time=2427] I believe in it because it's God's word and God's word is faithful and true.
[time=2430] But when I see developments like that, it only helps me think more clearly about the truth in God's word and even to get more excited that maybe in fact, we are at the end of the age.
[time=2443] That is the hope of the believer.
[time=2445] By the way, it says there in verse six, that these things must shortly take place shortly.
[time=2452] That doesn't mean soon.
[time=2453] That doesn't mean tomorrow.
[time=2455] That doesn't mean within a week.
[time=2457] Of course, John wrote this book in AD 90.
[time=2460] It's been a couple thousand years since he wrote the book.
[time=2462] Shortly mean swiftly.
[time=2464] There are two different Greek words.
[time=2465] The word here is swiftly.
[time=2467] Once it starts, it'll happen in a hurry.
[time=2470] And you know that because you study the book of Revelation, you know the great tribulation is seven years long and seven years in length in comparison to an earth history of maybe six or 10,000 year old earth.
[time=2481] Seven years goes by pretty quick.
[time=2483] It's fast, it comes, it hits, it executes.
[time=2487] So question number one, do I believe the forecast?
[time=2496] Do I believe my investment counselor?
[time=2501] Do I really think Biomet is gonna go back up to 30 in the near future?
[time=2510] God says to you, do you really believe that Christ is coming back?
[time=2514] His answer to you is believe me.
[time=2518] Trust me.
[time=2520] I have never spoken in air once in all that you know
[time=2526] about me and all before that.
[time=2528] I am faithful and true.
[time=2530] Look at my record and see if what I say doesn't come true exactly like I say it.
[time=2539] Now if you had that level of certainty with this question of buying Biomet,
[time=2546] I mean if you knew for sure that it was going from 10 to 30 in the next 60 days, what would you do?
[time=2555] You wouldn't just invest 10,000.
[time=2559] You'd invest every penny, you could get your hands on.
[time=2565] You'd sell your house, you'd mortgage your wife and kids to get in this thing, right?
[time=2571] You'd sell your oldest child.
[time=2574] You'd say where can I find more money?
[time=2576] Again, if I knew for sure, I'd find every stinkin' little penny I could find and invest it.
[time=2584] Then I know what we do, we bring it all here to the church and pay off all the debt, right?
[time=2588] Wouldn't that be nice?
[time=2589] That would be a great day.
[time=2591] Great day.
[time=2592] All right, but we don't know that about Biomet.
[time=2594] But we do know that about the second coming of Christ.
[time=2598] Because God said so.
[time=2599] So what's your response?
[time=2601] He gives you four areas of response.
[time=2603] Four areas of response is exciting.
[time=2605] This is where it comes right down to how we're supposed to live.
[time=2607] Look at it in verse seven.
[time=2608] Response number one, behold, I am coming quickly.
[time=2613] Blessed is he who heeds the words of the prophecy of this book, another translation might have been to obey.
[time=2620] The first response of the believer who stands firmly in the conviction that God's word is faithful and true is to clean out their life of any sin or disobedience that stands in the way of their relationship with God.
[time=2637] They look at the end of the age, they look at how it all comes to climax, they look at the new heaven and the new earth, they look at the glory and the splendor of being with God and they just instantly seek to purify their life.
[time=2648] They find any area of disobedience and they eradicate it immediately.
[time=2651] What else could I do?
[time=2654] As fast as I would run to mortgage my home and run to find other finances to buy this stock, I should run to clean my life.
[time=2662] I should seek the help I need.
[time=2664] I should find the counselors.
[time=2665] I should find the accountability.
[time=2667] I should delve into the word of God.
[time=2668] I should absorb myself in Christian things until my life is pure and holy and righteous because he's coming back.
[time=2674] I know he's coming back.
[time=2676] That's the first response that God gives you.
[time=2680] If you're really confident that he's coming.
[time=2683] Not because he's gonna judge you.
[time=2685] Not because you're afraid that he somehow is gonna slap your wrist.
[time=2690] It's not a fear motive, it's a joy motive.
[time=2693] My lands, why would I be involved in sin?
[time=2695] Why would I let my life on earth be taken away into the things of evil?
[time=2699] When I know that all this stuff is true.
[time=2702] Look at the end of evil.
[time=2704] Why do I want to be a part of that?
[time=2705] Death and Hades and sin and Satan and the antichrist
[time=2711] and the beast and everybody who followed them by this point in the book are burning in hell forever.
[time=2718] Thanks anyway.
[time=2719] The obvious response to purify the life.
[time=2723] Response number two, look at verses eight and nine.
[time=2726] And I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things.
[time=2732] And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
[time=2737] Now you say, are we supposed to worship angels?
[time=2740] Answer, no, only one is worthy of our worship.
[time=2743] That's God, verse nine.
[time=2746] That's why the angel said to me, do not do that.
[time=2749] You know, stop it, cut it out, get up.
[time=2752] I am your fellow servant of your brother and the prophets and of those who heed the words of this book.
[time=2758] If you wanna know who to worship, look at the end of verse nine.
[time=2760] Worship God, that's point number two.
[time=2764] That's response number two.
[time=2765] Response number one is living in radical obedience to the Word of God.
[time=2770] Response number two is worship God.
[time=2772] Let it pour out of your heart.
[time=2774] Get back in your heart and your mind to where we began the study of the great tribulation with the description of the worship in heaven.
[time=2781] Remember, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty who was and who is and who is to come.
[time=2787] Worthy our thou, O Lord, and our God to receive glory and honor and power for without its creed all things.
[time=2793] Because of thy will, they existed and they were created.
[time=2798] Worship, bow your heart, bow your will, bow the direction of your life, fix the center of your attention on the person of God because Christ is coming back.
[time=2809] Let him be everything to you.
[time=2811] Don't allow anything to you.
[time=2812] Serve his place of preeminence in your life.
[time=2815] Don't allow money, don't allow pleasure, don't allow friends, don't allow personal pursuits, don't allow anything to sit on the throne of your life except for God himself.
[time=2827] Pretty practical stuff.
[time=2828] Worship God.
[time=2831] You know what worship is, right?
[time=2833] Worship is just the thing that I fix my attention on.
[time=2836] I'm looking to it and I'm seeking to please it.
[time=2840] I'm seeking to gain its favor.
[time=2842] Let nothing else be in that spot but God himself.
[time=2846] Response number three.
[time=2848] Response number three is in verses 10 and 11.
[time=2851] And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book for the time is near." Now you remember from our study there are sometimes where John isn't allowed to say what he sees.
[time=2863] But this is the opposite injunction.
[time=2865] Don't seal it up, which is to say, "Tell everybody." Tell everybody you know.
[time=2871] If you really believe Christ is coming back, one of the obvious, unavoidable responses to that.
[time=2878] Tell everybody you know, they gotta know.
[time=2883] They can't, they can't not know.
[time=2885] You can't know them and them not know what you know.
[time=2888] It's inconceivable.
[time=2890] Let me ask you a question.
[time=2891] If you knew for sure that Biomet was going from 10 to 30, you knew for sure?
[time=2898] You might tell a few people.
[time=2901] You might tell a few people after you bought your stock.
[time=2905] You know, people don't keep good news like that, quiet.
[time=2914] So he's saying, don't seal up the words.
[time=2917] Don't seal up the lips of your mouth.
[time=2919] Don't seal up the avenues of your life.
[time=2921] Don't seal up.
[time=2922] Don't encase yourself in such a way that you can't live and preach and communicate and tell everybody you know that I'm coming back.
[time=2929] It's an obvious command to witnessing, to evangelism.
[time=2934] - Interesting little thing there in verse 11.
[time=2936] Sometimes it causes people.
[time=2938] Struggle so we'll mention it.
[time=2939] Verse 11, he says, "Let the one who does wrong "still do wrong and let the one who is filthy "still be filthy and let the one who is righteous "still practice righteousness and let the one who is holy "still keep himself holy." You almost get the idea that God says, "Boy, I don't care if you're sinful now, "stay sinful forever, I don't care about you." And if you're holy now, you stay holy forever and that's just the way it is.
[time=2959] That's not what he's saying.
[time=2960] That's not the compassion and heart of God.
[time=2962] What God is saying is if a person can come to the book of Revelation and learn all that they've learned about the end of the age and Christ and the person of Christ and the glory of those who follow and the heaven and the privilege of those who have committed their lives to Christ and the hell and the damnation for those who haven't given their life to Christ.
[time=2977] If they go through all that and still reject Christ then just let them stay in that state.
[time=2982] And God does that.
[time=2983] God confirms people in their unbelief.
[time=2986] He's saying if they won't repent after this kind of information and this kind of revelation then they're beyond repentance.
[time=2992] Pharaoh hardened his own heart, hardened his own heart, hardened his own heart until finally God saw that was the condition of his heart and he confirmed it and then it says God confirmed his heart.
[time=3000] So it's not a wish on God's part.
[time=3005] God's desire and longing is for repentance but when somebody shows the true character of their heart is beyond repentance then God confirms them in that.
[time=3011] Response number four.
[time=3015] Look at this, verse 12.
[time=3017] Behold, I am coming quickly and my reward is with me to render to every man according to what he has done.
[time=3026] This is a command of service.
[time=3028] The fourth response to the sure coming of Christ is that you dedicate your life to serve him as a banker, as a real estate agent, as a pilot, as whatever you are, whatever your sphere of influence is.
[time=3043] In your church, in your home and in your workplace you see yourself as a servant of the king and you're representing his interest.
[time=3050] You work with integrity and honor and you do your job as a Lord and you tell people about Christ in the process by your godly example.
[time=3058] You get involved in service and ministry in the church, in other words, if he's gonna come back and reward you for what you've done then you better get busy doing what you're gonna do because if he's got a reward offer you wanna be there with your hand out saying, "I'm ready, I worked hard, what do I get?" I wanna please you by showing my interest in your reward through my service, through my love and my kindness and my deeds.
[time=3086] That's interesting in it, look at those four again.
[time=3090] Maybe there's an order there that isn't accidental.
[time=3093] If you believe with all your heart that Christ is coming back again then you're gonna throw all you've got, all of you into first obedience and then worship.
[time=3106] Remember what it says in the Old Testament?
[time=3107] To obey is better than sacrifice.
[time=3111] God doesn't want you in here living a sinful ungodly, undisciplined life and think that your worship is acceptable to him.
[time=3119] Now maybe you're in the process of repentance but the notion is get your life straight, get a scrub brush out and look in every little nook and cranny of your life and scrub out the sin as much as you can to be in the constant process of obeying God first and then make your sacrifice.
[time=3136] So there's a person in view here
[time=3142] who is, as Kevin's saying, seeking to have a purified heart out of that comes this irresistible commitment to come into the house of God and worship him.
[time=3153] And upon leaving there seems no way to shut the lips of that saint from proclaiming the glory of God, the wonder that Christ is coming back.
[time=3160] And then lastly there is this commitment to serve him, to serve him.
[time=3173] About four years ago, well five, six years ago, I was watching my brother-in-law make a series of investments in property.
[time=3182] And back in California about five, six years ago, you could make some really good returns doing that.
[time=3188] And he was, he had hooked up with an older man who was a Christian guy that had done a lot of investment in properties.
[time=3196] In fact, he had made a fortune in storage lockers.
[time=3200] They called him Crocker Lockers because this man's name was Crocker.
[time=3204] Crocker's Lockers.
[time=3205] And they were all over just dotted in Central California.
[time=3207] And he was making upwards of a million dollars on each one by the time he would sell it after holding it just a short time.
[time=3215] My brother-in-law started to get involved in a few of those and I was kind of standing on the sideline watching.
[time=3223] About four years ago, he said to me, would you like to invest in one of these lockers?
[time=3230] And I said, oh my, yes, I'd love to.
[time=3234] So hiding nice grounds around and we were able to come up with a couple of thousand dollars.
[time=3239] And we were so excited to get that money in the project and we signed our little name there on that limited partnership agreement.
[time=3248] And oh boy, the numbers were exciting.
[time=3251] They were expecting to get our first, I think it was $5,000.
[time=3256] That was what we had in it.
[time=3257] They were gonna get that out for us within 18 months.
[time=3260] And then because there was no rent control, there was housing rent control in California, but there was no rent control on storage space.
[time=3267] Those could be gradually increased and the profit margin was just gonna just go great.
[time=3271] Maybe we're so excited, you know?
[time=3273] How that is?
[time=3274] Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[time=3276] Guess where my $5,000 are today?
[time=3279] They're on a vacant lot.
[time=3281] No crockers, lockers.
[time=3283] Nope, just some weeds and a tree or two.
[time=3286] You're welcome to stop by and see it anytime.
[time=3287] You're not in California, let me know.
[time=3289] Let me show you right over there to my big investment.
[time=3292] I remember in the conversation of this whole thing when my brother and I said, "So, Al, tell me again now.
[time=3298] You're telling me within 18 months, I'm gonna get my $5,000 back 'cause we'll get different investors to come in and get mine now." And then this thing goes up on a monthly basis.
[time=3305] He says, "Yeah, that's how it's supposed to work." I said, "Well, are you sure it's gonna work that way?" And he looked over at me with this sick look on his face, like I had had three heads.
[time=3314] And he said, "Am I sure?" This is called an investment.
[time=3318] If you wanna return, you have to assume risk.
[time=3321] No, I'm not sure.
[time=3322] I think it's gonna happen, I've got my money in it, but I can't guarantee that for you.
[time=3326] Well, so I learn these things.
[time=3329] Let me tell you something.
[time=3333] See this?
[time=3334] This is not my brother-in-law.
[time=3336] Praise God for that.
[time=3338] (audience laughs) Okay?
[time=3342] And this is not crocker.
[time=3344] That's successful as both of them continue to be in other investments.
[time=3347] (audience laughs) Okay, this is the word of God.
[time=3353] Now, I can promise you today, based upon its own evidence and testimony and track record, based upon the difference that you have seen it make in your life, that I have seen it make in my life, I can promise you one thing, Jesus Christ, is going to come back exactly like it says in Revelation.
[time=3378] Now, that's not up for grabs.
[time=3381] The only question left is what kind of an investment
[time=3387] are you going to make in obeying God and worshipping God and telling other people about it and serving Him?
[time=3400] That's all that's left.
[time=3403] I hope you make the right choices.
[time=3405] Let's pray.
[time=3406] (gentle music) - Well, you've been listening to the music today

[time=3433] Dear Heavenly Father, we've heard so much about the end times and you're coming again to rule and reign on this earth.
[time=3442] I'm thankful that you're our savior and that we can ask forgiveness for our sins and ask you to come into our heart.
[time=3450] And today I pray that you'll just forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today, in Jesus name I pray, amen.
