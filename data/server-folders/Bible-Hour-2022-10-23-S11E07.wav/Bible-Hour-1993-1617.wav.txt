[time=0] It's almost as if our society is saying, "If we can prevent or eradicate the physical
[time=11] consequences, pregnancy and sexual diseases, then we have sex with no consequences."
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=36] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=39] Thank you for joining us.
[time=41] We live in a sex-crazed society.
[time=44] Everywhere you look, from billboards to movies to the TV set, sex seems to be the driving force.
[time=50] We have the consequences of sexual immorality never seemed to be depicted.
[time=55] In fact, our society is committed to eradicating any and all the consequences of sexual sin.
[time=61] But can this really be done?
[time=63] Today Pastor Moore opens the word of God and helps us understand the real consequences
[time=69] of sexual immorality.
[time=71] Our special music today will be provided by the Trumpetrio.
[time=78] Let's join our concert choir as they begin our service.
[time=102] Shall I get the remorse, shall I bring him home, shall I shower diamonds, my God, my
[time=119] gold, shall I take all true rose-like swords upon, give him laughter, bring me civil laughter,
[time=139] offer him war, laughter and love.
[time=146] Shall we gather emeralds, shall we bring him home, shall we shower diamonds, my God,
[time=170] shall we take all true rose-like swords upon, give him laughter, bring me civil laughter,
[time=189] bring me civil laughter, bring me civil laughter, bring me civil laughter and love.
[time=210] Shall we give him these gifts, and in your heart, honor is worth as you need, honor is worth as you need, no matter who in Rosario is, silver, or gold.
[time=240] Neither bring diamonds, my God, my gold, shall I take all true rose-like swords upon, you have left us,
[time=262] and please will laughter, send the warm laughter and love.
[time=277] Well, good morning, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=298] We're happy that you're with us.
[time=299] And as we all begin to anticipate, the beginning of another school year, I know the more household
[time=305] has been very, very busy, Heidi's been taking the girls out as they get prepared to go back to school, they're excited about that.
[time=312] And I've just been using these last few weeks of summer to reflect upon the goodness of God.
[time=317] And I don't know about you, but I've had a tremendous summer, and I've sensed the pleasure of God in my life,
[time=323] and his gentleness as he has lifted my spirits and restored me in many, many marvelous ways.
[time=329] And I guess part of that is just having the sun out, but I'm just reflecting and thinking and appreciating the living, vital relationship that I have with Christ.
[time=340] And I trust that you too are taking time to reflect and to remember and to think back upon your summer and evaluate it.
[time=347] And where a resolution needs to be made and commitments of change that you'll have a better year as you move towards the fall, maybe that's the case.
[time=357] Don't be afraid to do that. Sit down quietly with the Lord and review and think, "Lord, how am I doing and where am I fitting into your plan for my life and counting on him to give you strength and wisdom and direction as you pursue that?"
[time=371] Well, I know a man who has undergone tremendous questioning in his own life as he has examined that question, "God, what are you doing in my life?"
[time=379] is a man by the name of Dave Drovecki, who played for the Giants, a professional baseball player, and his compelling and emotionally driving life story is being brought to us in a film about Dave Drovecki.
[time=393] We'll have it here at the church on September 1. That's a Wednesday evening at 7 o'clock in our main sanctuary here on 7,400 East State Boulevard, and it's open to you.
[time=402] We'd love for you to come. It's a tremendous account of a man who lost his ability to pitch because of his left arm.
[time=409] He was left-handed, and then regained that strength, and then eventually his arm broke again, and it was a traumatic moment.
[time=417] It happened right there on the mound as he was pitching in a major league game, but in that, he found his got faithful and true, and it's a wonderful account.
[time=426] We invite you to come and visit with us that evening.
[time=428] Also, I want you to know we have a special gift offer for you this month. It's a little book by Leroy Eims called "Whatever Christian Should Know About Growing."
[time=438] And this little book will give you some helpful steps to the growth process.
[time=444] If you're new to the Lord or just feel stagnant in your walk with him, write us here at the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=455] We'd love to send it to you, free of charge, and hope that it would be a tremendous source of encouragement to you to maybe restart the engine or give you a new direction and purpose in your walk with the Lord.
[time=467] Well, this morning we're speaking on the topic of sexual impurity, and I feel compelled in my heart just out of my concern and love for you and for other Christians.
[time=477] We stand in a day and an age that assaults us and invites us and makes enticing what is very destructive, and I trust that you'll watch with interest as we speak on this vital subject. God bless you.
[time=497] [MUSIC - 140 seconds]
[time=647] [APPLAUSE]
[time=663] Thank you guys. Well done. Well, if you'll take your Bibles this morning, let's open it to Proverbs, Proverbs chapter 7, and we're in between book studies of the Bible and spending the remaining weeks of summer, just kind of letting the Lord speak to us through various topical messages, and this morning we come to Proverbs chapter 7, verse 6, and following, if you would follow along as I read.
[time=692] Proverbs 7, verse 6, "For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice and I saw among the na√Øve. I discerned among the use the young man lacking sense, passing through the street near her corner, and he takes the way to her house in the twilight in the evening in the middle of the night and in the darkness.
[time=718] And behold, a woman comes to meet him dressed as a harlot in cunning of heart. She is boisterous and rebellious. Her feet do not remain at home. She is now in the streets, now in the squares, and lurked by every corner.
[time=732] So she seizes him and kisses him with a brazen face. She says to him, "I was due to offer peace offerings today. I have paid my vows. Therefore I have come out to meet you to seek your presence earnestly.
[time=746] And I have found you. I have spread my couch with coverings, with colored linens of Egypt. I have sprinkled my bed with merr, alos, and cinnamon. Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning.
[time=758] Let us delight ourselves with caresses. For the man is not at home. He has gone on a long journey. He has taken a bag of money with him. At full noon, he will come home."
[time=772] I want to talk this morning on the issue of sexual purity. And this is something, of course, which touches our society at large. It touches the city of Fort Wayne. It touches the people of this church. It touches me.
[time=788] We live in one of the most decadent ages in the history of the world, and it comes to us in technicolour through all the greatest eventments of the modern man.
[time=798] One survey I read said that by the time a person is 20 years old, if they watch the average amount of television, they have been exposed to 90,000 sex scenes just on television.
[time=812] If we're driving down the street, we're hit with a barrage of sexually enticing advertisements, which are allegedly telling us that if we'll buy that product, we'll have those feelings or at least our attention is arrested by the nature of the advertisement.
[time=828] The movies we watch are often times punctuated with gross scenes of immorality. But all the tempting seems somehow to be the same through the ages, though they do it with the technology of the modern man. It seems to have the same elements.
[time=845] Remember with me the passage we just read here in chapter 7 of the Proverbs. It is one dramatically sensual. Verse 10, she is dressed as a harlot. She's dressed to kill. She's in her most seductive outfit.
[time=859] She's aggressive, verse 13, because she seizes him and kisses him and with a brazen, an unabashed face says to him and says, "I want you and you alone." Verse 16, "I've spread my couch with coverings, I've colored linens of Egypt, sprinkled my bed with things that smell real nice and will have the whole night to drink of each other's love."
[time=882] It's the dramatically sensual and that's what gets thrown in front of us on a regular basis. It's only the most beautiful women and the most handsome men that find their way on to our television screens and into the movies and into the advertisements.
[time=894] And what is portrayed there is the epitome of what might be experienced in the sensual realm.
[time=902] Secondly, it seems to strike at the ego. It's ego inflating. She's a very clever woman. She says in verse 15, "Therefore I have come out to meet you to seek your presence earnestly and I have found you."
[time=916] Frankly, I don't think she would have cared if it was him or someone else, but in order for her to be successful in her persuasions and in her enticing she needs to give him the impression that he is the object of the soul and exclusive object of her passion.
[time=931] But most interestingly, and that which parallels our own society the most is that she promises him sex without consequences, intimacy without consequences, verses 19 and 20.
[time=943] For the man, he's not at home. He's gone on a long journey. I know that because he's taken a bag of money with him, he won't return until full noon.
[time=955] We're safe. We will remain uninterrupted and undetected. No one will ever know what we have done. There will be no consequences to our sexual immorality.
[time=971] And that has got to be the theme of our day. No consequences to sexual immorality. It's done in our country this way. First, we reduce sex to merely a physical act.
[time=987] We say that sex is just the anatomy of two people coming together. And we are told that in a host of different ways. You may have seen the previews or the advertisements to the movie with Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson and Robert Redford.
[time=1006] Demi and Woody in this movie are portrayed as a loving couple. They're married. They're in the sanctity of their marriage, but they though previously affluent have fallen on hard times and now really have no money.
[time=1021] And they're kind of on a last financial fling in Las Vegas and they run into this incredibly handsome billionaire played by Robert Redford.
[time=1029] And he makes them an indecent proposal. He offers them a million dollars if she'll sleep with him. And the preview that I saw showed the couple wrestling through the decision.
[time=1042] And finally she comes up with this line, honey, all I'm going to give him is my body. I'm not going to give him my mind and my heart.
[time=1053] Sex in the 90s, the concern behind sex in the 90s, the only consequences that people are concerned about with sex in the 90s seem to be the physical consequences because sex is somehow being reduced to a physical act.
[time=1067] Jeremy Irons Film Damage, weekly entertainment comment in it on this way, quote, "In damage we are watching two people who bond through sex yet remain separate spiritually, who found each other only because they agreed to use each other."
[time=1087] But somehow is one being reduced to the physical and then secondly, therefore if we can eradicate the physical consequences of the act, we have no consequences at all.
[time=1099] If sex is just a physical act and we can reduce the physical consequences of sex, we have no consequences.
[time=1106] What would those be? Pregnancy? Well, we're now clicking off to the 30 million mark of abortions in our country, so we can eradicate that consequence.
[time=1119] And then the big push is called safe sex. Sex is safe if you don't get the communicable disease or you don't get somebody pregnant.
[time=1128] Therefore, safe sex and no consequences. It might interest you to know that some 56 million people in the United States of America have an incurable sexually transmitted disease.
[time=1143] That's one out of five. Safe sex is a myth. Condoms fail regularly.
[time=1151] So beyond the notion that there is such a thing as removing the consequences even at a physical level, which you can't do, people are going to continue to get pregnant, and people are going to continue to get communicable diseases despite the advances of technology.
[time=1166] But even if you get a wipe all that out, sex still has consequences, because sex is far more than a physical act.
[time=1178] The Bible portrays sex as the joining of two people, not just at a physical level, but at a spiritual, emotional, psychological, emotional level.
[time=1194] And the consequences and the damage of illicit unions cannot be eradicated. In Genesis, chapter 2, verse 24, it says there that the man shall leave his mother and father and shall cleave to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.
[time=1215] There is something going on there in the one flesh union that draws the human together, the human components.
[time=1225] The body and the mind and the heart and the soul and the emotions are somehow united in that act. There is a fusing of two people.
[time=1235] It's almost as if in your mind's eye you could see two tributaries, two rivers moving inextricably towards each other, and finally they join into one river, and then somebody comes to you and says a mile downstream.
[time=1250] Now separate again for me the two rivers, will you?
[time=1253] Take for me out of this one river, the water of the first tributary, and then the water of the second tributary.
[time=1259] You can't do it. It's impossible. They've been joined. That's why in Matthew 19, and you often hear this at weddings more as a warning, it's not really a warning, Jesus says, therefore they are no longer two but one flesh.
[time=1278] What, therefore God has joined together, let no man separate, in other words he's saying you can't separate it. The dynamics of the physical union of two people bring them inextricably together.
[time=1293] Something happens at a level far deeper than the physical.
[time=1298] That's why in 1 Corinthians 6, 18, the sin of sex is described different than any other sin in the Bible. It says there are flea immorality.
[time=1309] Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body, his own person.
[time=1327] He can't just get involved physically and walk away from it. It says if you would say to yourself, well, I mean an example of how impossible this is, and I wish it weren't summer.
[time=1341] It's strange for you to hear me say that. But if only it were November or December or January and the temperature was zero degrees, you would understand far better what I'm trying to say to you.
[time=1351] But if it were zero degrees, I'd recommend you go outside, get your tongue nice and wet, find a pole, and place your tongue on the pole, and leave it there for three or four minutes, and let the fusion take place and then walk away.
[time=1376] You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it without ripping part of your tongue off.
[time=1385] And people in our day and age say, oh, what are you talking about? Sex, that's just a physical act. I'm fine. That'd be like a guy walking away from that pole with his blood hanging out of his mouth and saying, I didn't feel anything.
[time=1398] I didn't bother me. Would you be proud of that? Would that be something you're excited about saying and doing? You can't violate the physical universal spiritual laws that God has placed inside the universe.
[time=1414] This is more than a physical act. See, as Lewis said it this way, every time a man and a woman enter into a sexual relationship, a spiritual bond is established between them, which must be eternally enjoyed or eternally endured.
[time=1431] He's right.
[time=1436] You remember the sin of David, the powerful wealthy David, who was king of Israel, he saw the woman, Bashiba, and said, I wanted it summoned her to his chamber, and there he fused himself to someone who was not his wife.
[time=1451] More happened there than the physical union of two people.
[time=1457] And reluctant as he was to confess his sin finally after the prophet Nathan came to him and he confessed it, what was his prayer? His prayer was to bring wholeness back into his life because he had illegitimately fused part of his soul to someone else.
[time=1472] He was disconnected with himself, he was disconnected from God, and he was disconnected from the people in his life.
[time=1481] He was no longer whole, he no longer had integrity, the word means sound, complete, full.
[time=1488] And so in his prayer of repentance he says, God make me whole, purify me with his op, and I shall be clean, wash me and I shall be wider than snow.
[time=1499] They face from my sins and blot out my aniquities, create in me a clean heart, oh God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
[time=1508] David knew that the consequences of sexual sin reached far deeper than the physical, they went deep into his soul, and he was entornment, he was fragmented, he was torn apart because he had been fusing himself in illegitimate ways.
[time=1528] The morning after syndrome of people, I counsel talk about the resentment and the sense of shame and the sense of embarrassment and the sense of the loss of integrity that comes from this allegedly physical act.
[time=1543] And they wish it could be as simple as it is portrayed in the movies.
[time=1550] They wish it could be just a matter of giving someone their body and not giving them mind and heart, but they know deep within that it's a whole lot more than that.
[time=1561] They no longer want to be alone, they don't want to be by themselves with themselves because they don't like who they are anymore.
[time=1571] They have difficulty coming into the sanctuary and genuinely reflecting on the person of God and trying to give themselves in worship to God because they're a fragmented person.
[time=1582] And they find it incredibly difficult to re-enter relationships that once were sound and whole because they don't bring a sound and whole person to the relationship any longer.
[time=1597] Don't buy it. Don't be misled. Don't misunderstand the powerful dynamics which God has built into the sexual union.
[time=1611] He has given us here the greatest gift that he could give, the greatest expression that he could give of two people intersecting and touching at every human level.
[time=1622] Physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, the whole nine yards, one flesh, but we live in a culture that wants to focus only on the physical.
[time=1634] The physical gratification and the physical consequences and they promise you that they can eradicate the physical consequences.
[time=1643] They can't do that much less touch the emotional, the mental, and the spiritual.
[time=1657] Proverbs was written by Solomon. Solomon at an early age asked God for wisdom and God gave it to him in an unusual amount.
[time=1671] Solomon pictures himself in verse 6, "A little bit like you and me when we're at the airport or at a ballgame or in a mall where people watching, we're looking at the people, we're wondering who they are, we're wondering where they come from, we're wondering what makes them them."
[time=1685] For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice and I saw the na√Øve. You know what the word na√Øve means? It means open-minded.
[time=1694] It means susceptible to be influenced, easily influenced. What you've got here is a person who is only seeing a part of the picture and therefore is very easily influenced.
[time=1708] And he's led into his own destruction because he has blinders on and he only sees a part of the pie. Solomon labors in chapters 5, 6, and 7 to take the blinders off, to help the na√Øve to see themselves as na√Øve and to become wise.
[time=1728] He says in chapter 6, verse 27, "Can a man take fire into his bosom and his clothing not be burned? You've got to be nuts. You think you can take fire into your own heart and not suffer the consequences of that? You can't violate the law of God."
[time=1748] He goes on to say, "Or can a man walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?" The point of this is that there are consequences and he gives us 10 of them, at least that I saw, 10 of them in chapters 5, 6, and 7, and I'd like to go through them with you.
[time=1764] Why? Because I want to stand as a friend, I want to stand as a voice, and in case you're on the precipice, a sexual immorality this morning.
[time=1774] In case there's that someone in your life, who is not your spouse? And there's that something that's beginning to connect, the energy's beginning to happen, it's being communicated in your eyes, and it's being said by body language, and maybe it's even finding articulation from your lips.
[time=1792] Don't be na√Øve. Don't buy into the barrage of false information that is given to you by the prints of the power of the air in technicolor, telling you that you can do that and find anything but death.
[time=1808] No, it's not there. It's your being na√Øve. You're seeing just a small little part of the picture.
[time=1818] Let me give you 10 other pieces of the puzzle. Maybe you're the one who is being tempted and wishing and longing in the secret parts of your heart to find an unaccountable moment where you could divulge yourself in pornography.
[time=1834] You're longing for that breakaway moment. Maybe you're making plans for that. Maybe you've got some stashed. Maybe on your business trips. Maybe somehow some way on your television, you've figured out a way.
[time=1850] My friend, you're seeing a just a little itty bitty portion of the puzzle. You're being seduced. You're being led to your own slaughter. You are having the life ripped right out of your hands. It's a lie.
[time=1868] You can't take fire into your breast and not be burned. You can't walk on hot coals and not have your feet singed. Don't believe them. Believe the Word of God. Listen to it as it speaks to you this morning. Consequence number one.
[time=1886] Chapter five, verse nine. The context. Again, the adulterer. You see her in verse three. Her lips drip honey. Her speech is smooth like oil. But it says in her verse, for her end is bitter as warm wood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death. Her steps lay hold of shawl.
[time=1915] So there's the context. Now look at here's consequence number one. Verse nine, "Less you give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one." The vigor, the energy of your life. Consequence number one is you end up with a wasted life. A wasted life.
[time=1932] You say, where should the vigor of my life go? Where should the energy? Where should the intensity? Where should my thoughts and my imaginations be captured?
[time=1941] Well, they should be captured on building strong and true and reliable character building yourself into a reliable, faithful human being.
[time=1949] That's where the vigor and the energy of your youth should go. Secondly, it should go to your family, your relationship with your wife and your kids.
[time=1956] You should devote the best of yourself to providing a home that cares and shelters and provides and protects them against the onslaught.
[time=1965] That takes energy. That takes commitment. That takes stamina. If you give it away to sexual immorality, you will not have the vigor that you need to return to your home and provide for them the environment that they deserve.
[time=1979] You'll give it away. We need your vigor here at the church. We need your investment in this church. You need to give your life to other people here who are more needy spiritually than you, the process of discipleship.
[time=1994] You need to be involved in intimate personal relationships with the body of Christ where you invest the vigor of your life in them.
[time=2003] If you tie yourself up in illicit sexual endeavors, you will not have that energy for us. You will have a wasted life. You will have spent yourself on yourself.
[time=2021] Consequence number two is found in the next verse, verse 10, "Less strangers be filled with your strength and your hard earned goods go to the house of an alien." Financial loss.
[time=2036] Financial loss. Consequence number two, financial loss. Talk to anybody who's gone through divorce and watch them struggle and watch them hurt and watch them ponder the financial devastation of their lives.
[time=2050] What they had together in their estate, what they had been hoping for, what they had been planning to give to their next generation, to their children. Suddenly the attorneys get involved in this thing and the fighting begins and the fees escalate and the state gets involved and the thing gets ripped apart.
[time=2069] And oftentimes people live the rest of their life in poverty because somebody was sexually immoral and they thought it would all be a bed of roses.
[time=2085] The cost of the divorce, the division of the property and the home, the businesses failed, the debt mounts and financial hardship jumps on their backs and doesn't let go.
[time=2097] You say does that always happen? I should point out that these 10 consequences don't happen in every situation. They don't happen to everybody to the same degree.
[time=2106] But when you step into the arena of sexual immorality, these 10 consequences become potential for you at one degree or another.
[time=2116] A wasted life, financial ruin, number three, mental anguish. Listen to this in chapter 5 verse 11 and you groan at your ladder end when your flesh and your body are consumed.
[time=2130] Your mind and your soul groans under the weight of what you have done, the irreversible nature of it.
[time=2139] You are robbed of that sense of mental peace and stability and wholeness that when you reflect upon your life, you say I have not been the fool.
[time=2151] Maybe I haven't been the most successful person that ever lived. Maybe I didn't have the best athletic ability or the most money or the most talent.
[time=2159] But you know what? I stayed strong. These folks don't have that. When you give away your sexual purity, you enter into the arena of mental anguish.
[time=2172] And then fourthly, in chapter 5 verse 12, self-approach. Self-approach. And you say how I have hated instruction.
[time=2183] And my heart spurned, reproof. You have to deal with the reality that you didn't listen to the truth that was presented to you.
[time=2192] And you can find yourself reproaching yourself because you are worthy of that reproach. So a wasted life, financial loss, mental anguish, self-approach, number five, divine displeasure.
[time=2211] Divine displeasure, chapter 5 verse 21, for the ways of a man are before the eyes of the Lord. And he watches all his paths. The young man in our chapter 7 thinks he's safe because it's dark.
[time=2225] Remember, it's midnight. Nobody can see his face. At best they can make out his figure. So he thinks. He's in the clear.
[time=2237] But God sees it all. His ways are before the eyes of the Lord. He watches all of his paths. It's remarkable to me. The human capacity to do things in front of the eyes of God that they would never do in front of the eyes of people.
[time=2254] Somehow we are missing that sense of the fear of God, the reverence of God.
[time=2266] Consequence number 6, binding enslavement, chapter 5 verse 22, his own iniquities will capture the wicked. And he will be held with the cords of his sin.
[time=2284] Here the cords of his sin. It's a word picture to describe every time the man sins or the woman sins. It's as if another cord, another twine in the rope is added and the strength that it has to bind and to hold and to constrict the behavior of the individual.
[time=2303] Every sin gets stronger and it adds cumulatively until compulsively the person seems bound. Can't free himself any longer. Can't free herself from it.
[time=2316] And though they hate it and though they see its damage and though they would return and though they would never want to fall again, the cords are just too strong.
[time=2324] They can't get free. What began as their own choice, what began as their own, they elect to go and be involved in this sexual morality.
[time=2336] It's my choice. Suddenly the whole thing reverses. And now he's bound by it. It becomes an ugly taskmaster.
[time=2351] Consequence number seven. Look at verse 23. And he will die for lack of instruction and in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.
[time=2366] He ends up with a ruined life, a ruined existence. Later in the Proverbs it says this for an account of a harlot one is reduced to a loaf of bread.
[time=2379] Sexual immorality reduces the individual to a loaf of bread. Hollow at the core. Light, flighty. No substance. Not a rock. A ruined existence.
[time=2400] Look at chapter 6 verse 33. Number eight is a damaged reputation. Wounds and disgracey will find and his reproach will not be blotted out.
[time=2413] Now in our day and age that's harder because we tend to want to tell everybody that that's just common. That's just ordinary. And everybody seems to have their own story to tell.
[time=2425] Everybody has their own infidelity to tell. In other words the world works very, very hard at saying that sexual immorality really isn't all that big deal.
[time=2438] But in their hearts they know that they've violated their vows. They've compromised themselves. And their reputation is blighted.
[time=2448] Much like the scarlet letter of old they carry with them forever the mark of their misdeed.
[time=2460] Number nine verses 34 and 35 for jealousy in a rage is a man and he will not spare in the day of vengeance. He will not accept any ransom nor will he be content.
[time=2474] Though you give him many gifts. How do you assuage the anger and the wrath of the husband of the woman who has committed adultery?
[time=2484] If you read your newspaper, if you watch the news at all you'll know that murder after murder after murder after murder.
[time=2491] The innocent party and these things can sometimes just take the whole issue into their own hands and kill you.
[time=2501] God is saying there are consequences. Does it happen every time? No. But when you enter into the arena of sexual immorality you have no idea how the other person is going to respond.
[time=2513] Unrestrained revenge. And now number 10, chapter 7, verse 22.
[time=2522] Chapter 7, verse 22. Suddenly, back up in 21, she is with her many persuasions, she entices him with her flattering lips, she seduces him.
[time=2533] Suddenly, he follows her as an ox goes to the slaughter or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool. Unexpected destruction.
[time=2543] You enter yourself into the arena of unexpected destruction.
[time=2549] It goes on, verse 23, until an arrow pierces through his liver as a bird hastens to the snare so he does not know that it will cost him his life.
[time=2563] A wasted life, financial loss, mental anguish, self-approach, divine displeasure, binding enslavement, a ruined existence, a damaged reputation, unrestrained revenge and unexpected destruction.
[time=2581] God says to you this morning, see the whole picture. See the whole picture. Don't be naive. You're taking fire into your breast.
[time=2601] You say, what do I do? How can I, how can I, how can I change? Well, how do I protect myself against this? Well, he closes Proverbs 7 with some instruction along that line.
[time=2613] He gives us three, three words of advice, number one, found in verse 24. Now therefore my sons listen to me and pay attention to the words of my mouth.
[time=2623] First, he directs his comments to the most important sex organ you have. Your mind. He says, engage your mind. Think. Be concerned about what you think about and what you let your mind be exposed to.
[time=2642] Pay attention to the consequences of sexual immorality and guard your intake of sexually stimulating or explicit material. Guard your home. Guard your travels. Guard your interests. Guard your reading. Protect it.
[time=2662] Secondly, in verse 25 he says, do not let your heart turn aside to her ways. The heart in this context talking about your emotions, your longings, your passions.
[time=2675] Let me say it to you this way, if in the quiet moment when you are musing, when you are thinking, when you are imagining, when you're not engrossed in work and you're not engrossed in conversation, your mind is just free spinning, what is it spinning?
[time=2690] That will tell you the direction of your heart. If you are dreaming and pondering illicit sexual involvement, if you are remembering illicit sexual involvement of the past and hoping for similar ones in the future, my friend, your heart is out of control.
[time=2704] Your heart has gone astray. You're in trouble. You're on the edge.
[time=2711] Danger lurks. Don't let your heart turn aside to her ways.
[time=2721] And then the third thing he says, he directs himself first to the mind, then to the emotions, and then to the will. The end of verse 25, do not stray into her paths.
[time=2733] Do not stray into her paths. Do not choose to put yourself in a compromising situation.
[time=2742] You remember how it went with the young naive lad of earlier in the chapter? He said, I discerned the naive. Verse 8, he was passing through the street near her corner.
[time=2755] He says, I'll take a walk. Where should I walk? I think I'll walk over here. What's over here? Well, this is near her house.
[time=2766] He doesn't blatantly say to himself, I'm going to go to her house. So I'm going to get near her house.
[time=2772] But then, once he's on the corner, he's just another step away. He says, passing through the street near her corner, then he takes the way to her house.
[time=2782] He turns down her street. When does he do it? In the twilight, in the evening, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the darkness, in the unaccountable moment.
[time=2796] What he's saying to us here and not allowing ourselves to stray into her paths is to remove ourselves in advance from the compromising situations of life.
[time=2808] Whether you're on a business trip or whether you're home alone or whether it's the magazines that are the television or the movies that you see, what he is yelling at you is build into your life, the hedges of protection that keep you away from the vicinity of temptation.
[time=2826] Or you, like the young lad and like the ox, will find yourself mindlessly naive and focusing on only a part of reality and before you know it, you'll fall.
[time=2846] So he says, guard your mind and guard your heart and guard your will. Sexual immorality.
[time=2857] Let me say three things. Three pastoral things as we close just from my heart to you who are chased.
[time=2866] To you who are either unmarried and still virgins or married and faithful and you've never violated the law of God and respect to this.
[time=2879] I want to say something to you. I want to encourage you to cherish that as the most valuable possession that you have.
[time=2886] It's mitigated every day in your eyes in this society and in this culture and I want to say to you it's the most valuable possession you have.
[time=2893] Your faithfulness and your fidelity to your spouse or for you who are not married to your virginity is more valuable to you than anything else you can put your hands on.
[time=2903] It's more valuable than your home, your bank account, your job, your car.
[time=2909] It's a prized possession, value it, esteem it and celebrate it.
[time=2915] When I find myself remarkably discouraged at points just in the normal trials of life and feeling a failure and wondering what it all adds up to,
[time=2923] one of the things I go back to is the fact that I have never cheated on my wife.
[time=2932] There's something to that. There's something valuable there. Prize it. Enjoy it and let it be a strength to you.
[time=2944] Secondly, I want to say something to you who have been promiscuous. You who have cheated on your wives.
[time=2951] You who have violated your purity. God is in the business of putting people's lives back together.
[time=2962] God is in the business of answering prayers like David who not only prayed God give me a clean heart and a willing spirit and restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[time=2972] He went on in that same song to say, "And when you have done that I will teach transgressors their way." David knew that God is a restoring God.
[time=2982] Let me put it to you this way. The thing that would make Satan the happiest, that would give the dark side the greatest victory is this.
[time=2990] If after you have fallen, you say, "Therefore I am of no value. I have blown it. I have thrown it away. There is no sense trying any longer. So I may as well just wallow in my pity or continue to be involved in sexual immorality."
[time=3005] That gives them two victories, your purity and secondly the rest of your life.
[time=3011] What God wants you to hear this morning is that He is in the business of putting it back together, of going and finding little parts of your soul that you have illegitimately fused to other people.
[time=3022] He knows where they are and He can bring them back and make you whole.
[time=3028] If you will let Him, if you will study His Word, if you will allow Him to renew your Spirit, if you will confess your sin, if you will change your behavior, He will put you on the path of renewal.
[time=3041] And there will be a day again when you are found trustworthy and faithful and reliable and whole and complete and when you come into this house to worship God, you will have something to give.
[time=3053] From the innermost parts of your being, the words in the hymn will make sense again and you will feel like singing them to God because you have been made whole.
[time=3064] And you can again re-enter relationship with people and you can be genuine and real and whole and give them something from yourself.
[time=3073] And there can come a day again when you are not afraid to be alone with yourself because He can fix you and you can again take pride in what He has made you to be.
[time=3091] And thirdly, I want to say something as inadequately as I can as it will be, but I want to say something to you who have been violated.
[time=3100] There have been people who have taken things from you, taken parts of your soul through sexual abuse or rape that you did not offer them.
[time=3109] You were not a co-conspirator in this. You were violently transgressed. And I want you to know this morning that God is aware of the fact that you were not a conspirator in the process, that it was stolen.
[time=3126] And He is every bit as much in the business of restoring that kind of trauma and emotional hardship and hurt and fragmentation as He is the other.
[time=3139] God wants you to feel the strength of His loving arms in your life and to reassure you of His love and to reassure you He can put you back together.
[time=3149] Long and arduous as the path may be and He wants to use you for His glory.
[time=3158] I hope you picture this. I hope you sense this. I hope we can sense a sense of bonding this together against a world that is completely sex crazed. They are insane with it.
[time=3171] And we must find within ourselves the community of the redeemed and the strength of the word of God, the help and the encouragement and the hope that only God can give us to really understand the issues of life and to prize what is valuable and to stand for it together.
[time=3198] I can only have this thought if you are struggling at this point in your life and friends, I believe with my heart if we were to sample you this morning, 20 to 30% of you would be struggling deeply with this.
[time=3213] privately and isolated and all alone. I want to say to you find someone that you trust and invite them into this part of your life because you need their help.
[time=3233] But don't go out this door and stay in the isolation of your struggle and watch yourself deteriorate and tell you end up with Proverbs 5, 6 and 7.
[time=3248] Please seek help. Let's pray.
[time=3258] Father, we are in the world and we are not of the world. Then as we live our lives and as we see the damage of the prince of the power of the air and the destruction that he brings to people's lives through his damning lies, through his persuasive lies, through his ability to present only a part of the truth at the exclusion of the rest of it.
[time=3281] We learn to despise him and we learn to despise his ways and we learn to have a distaste in our mouth for all that is evil and we want to run from it and we want to find shelter in the house of the Lord.
[time=3301] We pray you would give us that shelter. We pray that you would make available the kinds of relationships here that can bear the weight and the load of that kind of exposure, that we could tell each other what is really going on and not find rejection.
[time=3319] That there could be this kind of support and strength in the fellowship of the redeemed. Thank you, Lord, for letting us see the rest of the picture, the rest of the story.
[time=3334] Just in the brief chapters that Solomon writes, these ten overwhelming destructive consequences of sexual immorality.
[time=3344] And God, we pray for the hearts that are wounded here today, that are struggling, that are either in destruction or on the edge of destruction.
[time=3352] Help them to sense your mercy and your gentleness in your soft and prompting hand, calling them, beckoning them, inviting them.
[time=3363] Knowing that you have the strength to break the cords of sin in their life and to set them on the path of life.
[time=3375] And we do pray for those who are tempting us. We pray for the Hollywood executives and the advertisers and the people that work with us, the people who don't know you, the people who are truly blinded.
[time=3395] But we ask you're mercy for them. We pray these things in Christ name. Amen.
[time=3405] Well, it's good to hear from God's word on a topic that is so prevalent in our day and one that I know so many of us struggle with.
[time=3419] God has provided forgiveness for failure in this area. If you'd like to accept Christ as your Lord and Savior, bow your head with me and let's pray this prayer and experience the forgiveness of God.
[time=3431] Lord, I know that I have violated you and your law and even people as this message points out. And I'm thankful that I have opportunity for forgiveness and the death and the sacrifice in Christ.
[time=3445] I admit and confess my sin to you. I accept Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. I ask Him to come into my life and change the way I live and free me from the cords of my own iniquity.
[time=3456] I love you and praise you for this in Christ name. Amen. If you've made a decision today, please write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
