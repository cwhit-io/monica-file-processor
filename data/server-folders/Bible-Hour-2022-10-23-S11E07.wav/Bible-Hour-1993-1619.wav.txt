[time=0] You know the Lord in this book of Matthew was confronting the Pharisees and he
[time=18] said to them later in this book, Matthew 23 he said to the Pharisees, you know you guys spend your life tying up heavy loads and putting them on the shoulders
[time=30] and on the backs of people and he's talking about the religious external performance that they continued to pile up on top of people so that people never
[time=42] really had a sense of being acceptable to God they never knew what it meant to experience the fact that the Lord's load is light and that his yoke is easy they
[time=53] plotted their way through life under the enormous spiritual legalism and they
[time=61] never came to the end of the week and could honestly say in their heart man I really it feels good to be in relationship with God I feel at peace I feel
[time=73] rested I feel accepted I feel as though I've done enough and even if maybe I haven't done enough I still feel as though I can rest in my relationship with God

[time=673] embrace the cross where Jesus suffered though it will cost all you claim
[time=685] as yours the sacrifice will seem small beside the treasure eternity can't
[time=696] measure what Jesus holds in store embrace the love the cross requires
[time=713] cling to the one whose heart knew every pain receive from Jesus
[time=724] mountains of compassion only he can fashion our hearts to move as he
[time=737] oh wonders cross our desires resting you Lord Jesus make us bolder to face
[time=753] with courage the shame and disgrace you all up on your shoulder embrace the
[time=770] life that comes from dying come trace the steps the savior walked for
[time=781] you and empty to concludes call that the sorrow endure then till tomorrow your
[time=794] cross of suffering embrace the cross embrace the cross the cross of Jesus
[time=811] Jesus well with Lori's words still in our mind
[time=841] let me ask you to turn in your Bible to Matthew chapter 11 and Jesus here in
[time=851] his own words invite you to embrace the cross he does it with a gentleness and
[time=859] a sensitivity that is very appealing to me he says here in Matthew 11 verses
[time=868] 28 29 and 30 come to me all who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you
[time=877] rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart and
[time=885] you shall find rest for your souls from my yoke is easy and my load is light
[time=896] I want to ask you a question this morning as we begin our study of God's word has
[time=904] it felt that way to you this week in your relationship with God has it felt like a
[time=915] place of rest has it been a light load and has the yoke really been easy or do you
[time=931] feel as though your God is more like a well a task master who no matter how hard
[time=939] you try always seems to be suggesting there were a few more things you could have
[time=946] done this week and the things that you did manage to accomplish were marred in
[time=953] some way by your humanness and so he might also be saying and you could have done what you did even a little better do you picture him with almost a sense of
[time=964] an irritated face looking down at your life and saying you could have done so much more
[time=976] is he upset is he irritated is he unsatisfied do his expectations for your life always seem
[time=986] to be just out of reach so no matter how hard you try you don't feel as though you can
[time=993] go to bed at the end of the day or view a week or think back on a summer and say you know what I really think that I met the expectations of God you know Jesus later in this book
[time=1007] confronting the false religious system of the Pharisees known as legalism said to them
[time=1013] in Matthew he's 25 I think it is he said you know you guys you guys take and you bind
[time=1020] together heavy loads as if to say one thing wouldn't be enough so you bind them together
[time=1027] until you get a big group of them and then you lay them on the backs of the people you
[time=1034] weigh them down with external requirements you rob from them the joy of knowing the rest
[time=1043] of salvation the peace of salvation my look indeed you can deed is really rather light it says
[time=1054] over in Romans chapter 5 that we have been justified by faith and therefore we are at peace
[time=1063] with God and that's not just a positional statement about our sins being washed away that
[time=1069] means that in reality we are at peace with God with through Christ all of his demands on
[time=1076] our life have been absolutely completely satisfied in fact he isn't irritated and in fact
[time=1083] he isn't upset and in fact he isn't frowning and in fact he isn't a task master but I look
[time=1090] at my own life and oftentimes I counsel with you and I feel like we have little Pharisees running around inside of us and they're whispering into our ears that we're not making it
[time=1102] that we're not cutting it that we should have done more that we should have done better that God is really upset disappointed that we can't meet his expectations for our life
[time=1114] and this morning I want to try to lift some of the illegitimate guilt some of the Pharisee
[time=1122] ism in our life and even in our church I want to try to refresh your heart and remind you
[time=1132] of the two things the irreducible minimums that God really wants out of you had an interesting
[time=1143] experience yesterday after dropping my in-laws off at the airport and we in reality we're
[time=1150] sorry to see them go they had served us so effectively the whole week long they even sent Heidi and I away for a couple of days they kept our little brood of children and in our absence they worked in the yard and they cleaned the house and they just did everything you could ever hope or imagine but we let them off we left the airport about 7 30 on our way back
[time=1168] and we were all hungry and we had all the kids and Heidi and everybody and we stopped at a McDonald's to get a bite to eat and we walked in there and suddenly at Donna I have made a great mistake it's hard for me to organize my family to order never feel that way you
[time=1184] see I have all these these people and they have they have trouble making up their minds and they think they know and they say it and they want to change your mind I sometimes get really irritated in this process and lose my temper with them and I'm normally in the practice of before we pull the driveway to that restaurant saying now think about what you're going to order and please have it ready by the time we make it to the front desk where we'll place our order and as I come to the door I'm realizing I haven't done this I'm wondering how much trouble am I in and then I come to see the individual who's going to take our order and my heart drops with compassion for this poor soul because
[time=1223] in this case it's even going to be a little more challenging I'm thinking because this is one of those unique and lovely and wonderful individuals that McDonald's has a habit
[time=1234] of hiring the handicapped they're standing in front of us a slightly mentally handicapped
[time=1241] 24 25 6 foot to 24 year old 6 foot to height individual and I can tell that it's a little
[time=1249] different because his head is shaped slightly odd and the hat there's there's gaps in his
[time=1255] hat and his eyes are a little more beady than normal and his mouth and his tongue and his
[time=1261] teeth aren't formed the way that that most peoples are and there's a there's a kind of a movement
[time=1267] in the hands that that shows you and I think to myself Lord be with us but I want you to
[time=1277] know something I was so remarkably surprised and moved by the experience because this
[time=1285] individual was phenomenal in fact I couldn't shake it from my thinking even as I left it
[time=1293] as I was at the office last night I wrote down these words as I thought about him attentive
[time=1299] he stood there and looked deeply into the eyes of everybody who was trying to give their order or re-give their order and he was 100% there for them never did I get the impression
[time=1311] that he wished we could hurry up never did I get the impression that we were irritating him by changing our order I noticed that he was very well trained I believe and I don't
[time=1323] know all about this individual but I believe that he was operating at the very outside edge of his envelope with capacity but it was obvious to me that the training program of McDonald's
[time=1334] which produces a rather stereotypical person at the desk which I appreciate he had learned
[time=1340] to all of the maneuvers that they had taught him he knew exactly what he was doing he had taken what they had given him and he was using it to its utmost and stood in broad contrast
[time=1352] to when we were ordering this breakfast meal and this breakfast meal he always punched the exact right button there was no hesitation in his mind he knew where it was and then he waited and looked and listened and asked questions and punched in the next one his colleague next to him who had to my observation no handicap whatsoever had not taken the training course very effectively because she didn't know which button to push for this particular breakfast order so she turned around and snapped at her manager and said which one am I supposed to push here my what a contrast I noticed as I have alluded to he was remarkably patient never
[time=1390] a sense of scurrying off never a sense of distractedness never a sense of wishing we would be finished or be done with or be over I noticed he was remarkably skillful when finally
[time=1401] he had placed our order in his little computer he then moved with concise definite patterns
[time=1408] back into the array of food that's available the drinks and all the rest he would pick up exactly what he need he placed it on the tray he'd go get what else he needed he never bumped in anybody he never dropped anything he was never a bother to anybody he just did his job with a very high level of skill and then there was this one at the end which took
[time=1428] me over the edge when we had it all there and he read it all back to us and we pretended to know that it was correct he then said is there anything else I could help you with and
[time=1448] he meant it for once in my life I didn't feel like somebody was asking me to buy something additional to what was already on the plate as you know that's a very common way of getting people to buy anything I I can help you with further and they don't mean that they mean please spend more money here what he meant was is there anything else I could get for
[time=1469] you and I was groping for a way to conclude this wonderful experience in my life with
[time=1477] this individual and I didn't know how to tell him it was in my heart and so I just looked him in the eyes and I said thank you very much you've done a tremendous job we were leaving
[time=1489] after we'd eaten our meal and we were driving on the highway and I couldn't get away from it I said how do you that was the I'd rather have that guy serve me than any other waiter
[time=1499] I've ever had in my whole life because there were two things about him he served me with
[time=1509] his whole heart and he served me to the best of his ability that it struck something deep
[time=1519] within me and I believe with all my heart those are the two irreducible minimums in your
[time=1528] Christian experience you know what God wants from you he wants you to serve him with your
[time=1536] whole heart and by that I mean a true heart and he wants you to use what he has given you
[time=1544] faithfully for his glory if I could go back to that guy and maybe I will without embarrassing
[time=1557] him or making him feel funny because of his handicap I would like to say three things to him
[time=1564] I would like to tell him that I would choose you of all the people who have ever waited on me and all the restaurants I've ever been I would choose you number two I'd like to
[time=1575] tell him that I respect you because you may never make six figures you may never drive
[time=1584] a big expensive car live in a big house fly on big trips you may never have your name written up in the newspaper do you know something you have the secret of life you've arrived you
[time=1596] have it because you do your job with the whole heart and you're doing it as best as you can
[time=1604] and then I'd like to thank him for reminding me of the two most important things in relationship
[time=1612] with God God wants my heart and God wants me to be faithful let's talk about it come with
[time=1625] me to 1 Samuel chapter 13 when we think about a heart for God if you were to peruse the
[time=1634] scripture for a person who is noted as having a heart for God we have to go to David
[time=1640] for Samuel chapter 16 did I say for Samuel 16 and it stated positively and it stated
[time=1651] negatively that David is a man after God's own heart it stated first in the rejection
[time=1659] of one who might have taken the place as king of Israel you remember this day Saul has been king he's in trouble he doesn't have a heart for God and God's going to replace him Samuel is the prophet of the day and so Samuel is sent by God to the house of Jesse Jesse has a whole bunch of sons and Samuel assembles the sons because he knows that it's one of these
[time=1679] who will be the new king in verse 6 chapter 16 it came about when they entered that they
[time=1686] looked at Elias and thought surely the Lord's anointed is before him he looked at his appearance
[time=1693] and said this has got to be the one verse 7 but the Lord sent to Samuel do not look at his
[time=1700] appearance or at the height of his stature because I have rejected him for God sees not
[time=1708] as man sees for man looks on the outward appearance but the Lord looks at the heart come back
[time=1716] a few chapters chapter 13 and here is Samuel telling Saul that you're finished and then replacement
[time=1726] has been selected and the replacement has been selected upon the quality and the character and the disposition of his heart for Samuel 13 13 Samuel said to Saul you have acted foolishly
[time=1738] you have not kept the commandment of the Lord your God which he commanded you for now the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever but now your kingdom shall
[time=1748] not endure the Lord has sought out for himself a man after his own heart and the Lord has
[time=1754] appointed him as ruler over his people because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you so negatively and positively David is said to be the man with a heart after God David
[time=1765] is the one with the super heart the heart that's fixed the heart that is fast the heart
[time=1771] that has the things of God heavily upon it so much so it is the criteria for his selection
[time=1777] and it is that for which we remember him in history but now here's the encouraging part
[time=1785] remember who we're talking about here David we're talking about a guy who committed adultery
[time=1795] and a guy who murdered the woman's husband right away we're learning that a man who has
[time=1806] a heart after God's heart isn't a perfect man it's a heart and even though there's failure
[time=1821] it turns back to God I don't think it's a mistake that of all the people's hearts we know about
[time=1827] in Scripture we know most about David so you want to know why we know most about David's because David wrote 73 of the 150 Psalms and the Psalms that's the book about the heart
[time=1838] that's a book about the emotions that's a book about the gut that's a book that gets inside and tells us how we're really experiencing God it's funny isn't it the one who is remembered
[time=1850] as the one with a heart after God is the same one that God privileged to write most of the Psalms nearly most of the Psalms come with me for a brief review of David's heart from the Psalms I want to show you seven aspects of David's heart and I want you to take notes
[time=1868] on these Scripture passages because I'm hoping that in the quietness of your own life and when you feel that you need your heart to be put back in order with God we're going to go to Psalm 38 first that you'll that you'll look to this list of scriptures and you'll
[time=1885] find in David's heart the kinds of things that should mark your heart first of all we find
[time=1894] in David a contrite heart it's sensitive to its own sin and it's willing to confess its
[time=1901] own sin Psalm 38 O Lord rebuked me not in thy wrath and chastened me not in thy burning anger
[time=1907] for thine arrows have sunk deep into me and thy hand has pressed down on me there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation there is no health in my bones because of my sin for my iniquities have gone over my head as a heavy burden they weigh too much for me
[time=1924] my wounds grow foul and fester because of my folly I am bent over and greatly bowed down I go morning all day long for my loins are filled with burning and there is no soundness
[time=1935] in my flesh and I am numb and badly crushed I groan because of the agitation of my heart
[time=1942] you want to know what it means to have a heart after God's heart it's when you have sin you seem
[time=1948] utterly incapable of rationalizing your sin excusing yourself for your sin distancing yourself from
[time=1954] your sin becoming hardened to your sin you're like David and it's like deep arrows driving into
[time=1961] you and your flesh is full of inignation there's no soundness there there's no health in your bones
[time=1968] you feel as though your sin is like a flood tide that washes over you the man with a heart after
[time=1974] God is a man who is willing to be sensitive to the prompting of the Holy Spirit to bring conviction
[time=1980] for sin and when that conviction is there there is a willingness to confess the sin
[time=1987] he says at the anniversary there's no health in my bones why because of my sin you might turn over to Psalm 51 and that's the classic breaking point of confession in his life
[time=2000] listen to him to hold up and own up to his own sin he cries out for the graciousness of God
[time=2007] according to God's loving kindness according to the greatness of thy compassion what blot out my transgressions wash me thoroughly from my iniquity cleanse me from my sin for I
[time=2019] know my transgressions and my sin is ever before me against the the only I have sinned and done
[time=2027] what is evil in thy sight so that thou art justified without us speak and blameless without us judge he is welcoming the disciplining hand of God in his life there when he says you're justified
[time=2039] when you speak and blameless when you judge not only is he sensitive to the power of the Holy Spirit to convict him of his sin he can't go on living he can't harbor unconfessed sin it's impossible
[time=2049] for him to continue to exist with unconfessed sin in his life secondly when the Spirit of God does
[time=2055] that he then confesses that sin and then welcomes the disciplining hand of God that's what it means to have a contrite heart David had a contrite heart secondly David had a humble heart David had a humble
[time=2073] heart so I'm 39 if you don't want to follow me and read these passages that's okay just write them down
[time=2080] and then read them in your quiet time with the Lord but listen to this now this is one of the
[time=2089] most talented men that have ever lived he is the most successful warrior and king of one of the greatest nations that's ever been on the planet he was marvelously gifted in writing as we are
[time=2100] evidencing a great poet a great power with words he was a phenomenal musician he was handsome he
[time=2107] was effective as a leader you're talking about a very very gifted man but listen listen to what he
[time=2114] says in Psalm 39 verses 4 through 7 Lord make me to know my end and what is the extent of my days
[time=2122] let me know how transient I am behold thou has made my days as hand breaths and my lifetime as
[time=2128] nothing in thy sight surely every man at his best is a mere breath surely every man walks about as
[time=2135] a phantom surely they make an uproar for nothing a massing riches and they don't even know who's going to gather them this is a man who understands he is a created being he is a finite being and he
[time=2148] stands in the presence of an infinite holy god and he says God the most important thing you can give me right now is a clear impression of how flight he my life is of what a lightweight I am
[time=2159] of how few days I will actually spend on this planet and however great a thing I accomplish
[time=2165] it's like nothing remind me of that constantly bring that to my conscious level of awareness
[time=2172] I am a zero in the scheme of eternity I am but a breath like a vapor no sooner can it form out
[time=2183] of my mouth and I can recognize it than it disappears that's me that's my life that's a humble heart
[time=2192] thirdly come to Psalm 5 he's got a contrite heart he's got a humble heart and I love this he's got a
[time=2202] dependent heart he's got a dependent heart David did accomplish great things David was talented
[time=2210] David was courageous but listen to what goes on inside of his heart Psalm 5 give ear to my words O Lord
[time=2219] consider my groaning he'd the sound of my cry for help my king and my god for to thee do I pray
[time=2228] in the morning O Lord that will hear my voice in the morning I will order my prayer to thee and eagerly watch this great successful powerful individual is finding it needful in the very beginning of the day
[time=2243] not at the end of the day but as he sets out on the course of life that's before him he cries out
[time=2249] for help from his heart and he says God take all my talents notwithstanding I'll apply them as
[time=2255] faithfully as I can today but if anything of any value is going to happen today it's going to happen because you have brought it to pass there is no self-sufficiency in this man's heart there is
[time=2267] no sense of autonomy independence the John Wayne attitude is long from this man's perspective
[time=2276] he says I'll just read to you in another place in Psalm 61 he says here my cryo God give heed to my prayer
[time=2284] from the end of the earth I call to thee when my heart is faint lead me to the rock that is higher than
[time=2291] I for thou has been a refuge for me in a tower of strength against the enemy let me dwell in thy
[time=2297] tent forever let me take refuge in the strength of my wings you know I recognize that I am in the presence
[time=2305] of a very strong man when I hear those kinds of words coming from his heart when I hear the dependence
[time=2314] of the heart trying for help from God then I know that I am in the presence of truly great and strong
[time=2321] individual it's when I hear the pompous arrogant self-sufficient noise of a proud heart
[time=2330] of an independent heart that I know I'm in the presence of true weakness
[time=2336] David it was always that way it seems he stood out on the plane facing the great Goliath and
[time=2342] said you talking this huge giant you come to me with a sword and a spear and a javelin in other
[time=2350] words you come to me in your own strength you come to me in the in the attitude of the day you know nothing of dependence upon God but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts the
[time=2363] God of the armies of Israel whom you have taunted this day the Lord will deliver you into my hands
[time=2369] and I will strike you down and I will take your head off all because he trusted and was dependent on
[time=2377] God number four David had a grateful heart I love this passage in Psalm 16 Psalm 16 verses
[time=2388] five and following David says the Lord is the portion and my inheritance and my cup thou dost support my lot the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places indeed my heritage is
[time=2400] beautiful to me I will bless the Lord who has counseled me indeed my mind instructs me in the
[time=2407] night I have set the Lord continually before me because he is at my right hand and I shall not be
[time=2414] shaken therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices this is a grateful heart this is a man
[time=2421] who looks at what he is whatever God has decided for the individual to be he says the lines have fallen to me in pleasant places that's a that's a throwback to when God was dividing up the nation of
[time=2432] Israel to the twelve tribes of Israel when they came through the Exodus experience and God was now going to a portion of the land it's a it's a remembrance of how God said this tribe will have this
[time=2442] piece of property and this tribe will have this piece of property and mind you some property was better than other property and what he is saying here is the way you have defined my life who you
[time=2453] have made me to be where you have brought me to live the friends you have given me the gifts the talents or the lack thereof the the job that I have God I'm thankful not because they're the best
[time=2467] because I have a grateful heart I'm content to have what you would have me have that's having a
[time=2476] heart after God number five come forward a couple chapters to chapter 19 and find that David had a
[time=2485] teachable heart David had a teachable heart another mark of greatness he says in verse seven of
[time=2493] Psalm 19 the law of the Lord is perfect restoring the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple the precepts of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the
[time=2504] Lord is pure even lightning the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true they are righteous altogether now listen to his heart they are more desirable than
[time=2515] gold yes than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the honeycomb
[time=2523] David was so teachable and so hungry for the truth of the word of God that he apprised their value more than gold much fine gold and more than the sweetest commodity they knew of honey
[time=2534] and drippings of the honeycomb Psalm 63 tells us that David not only had a hungry heart or a teachable heart he had a thirsty heart
[time=2551] he had an insatiable appetite for the person of God you remember this David exiled in the wilderness of Judah seeing there no doubt a a panting deer
[time=2564] that's near death for lack of water and sustenance and he grabs a hold of that experience and says in
[time=2573] verse one oh God thou art my God I shall seek thee earnestly my soul thirst for thee my flesh
[time=2580] yearns for thee in a dry and weary land where there is no water verse six when I remember thee on my bed I meditate on thee in the night watches for that has
[time=2589] been my help and in the shadow of eye wings I sing for joy now here it is my soul clings to the
[time=2595] David was a man who continually brought the thirst of his soul and the thirst of his heart and
[time=2604] the thirst of his being back to the only place it could be quenched the person of God
[time=2611] and you say well I don't know that that's my heart I thought you were going to try to lighten my
[time=2618] load this morning Russell you you make it heavier because I read these passages and I see his heart and I say that's not my heart come with me to Psalm 139
[time=2636] Psalm 139 listen to David listen to him now he says in verses 23 and 24 of Psalm 139 search me oh God
[time=2646] and know my heart try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way in me
[time=2655] and lead me in the way everlasting even to have a heart he knew he was dependent
[time=2661] and the moment you and I look at the heart of David and say to ourselves we don't have that kind of heart and we open ourselves to God and say God search my heart and know my heart and see if
[time=2672] there's any hurtful way in me and lead me in the path of everlasting at that moment we have the heart of David at that very moment we have the heart of David if you look at this list and you say that's
[time=2686] not my heart those aren't the consistent patterns of my heart those aren't the longings of my heart and you simply confess it and ask God to change it in your life instantly that's your heart that's the joy of it all that's the freedom of it all what God wants is your heart
[time=2700] even if it's a beat up mangled atrophied heart he just wants that the Marines have a tendency of appealing to our sense of exclusivity and they say to us the
[time=2716] Marines are looking for a few good men God is looking for a few good hearts it says in 2nd
[time=2727] Chronicles 169 the eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth that he may support
[time=2733] those whose heart is completely his you know what that means God's eyes are on an active search
[time=2741] they're searching the people of black hawk the eyes of God are making their way into the hearts
[time=2747] of the pastoral staff and the elders and the deacons and the folks and the abf's and all of us here
[time=2753] this morning and you know what he's wanting to find not your accomplishments not your credentials
[time=2759] not your business card not your bank account not your giving record he wants to see a heart
[time=2766] it's fixed on him that's it give him your heart give him your heart
[time=2776] secondly I want to talk to you about God's desire for faithfulness the first thing he wants
[time=2788] from you is an irreducible minimum is your heart the second thing he wants from you is faithfulness and this is so liberating in 1 Chronicles 4 2 it says this excuse me 1 Corinthians 4 2 it says this
[time=2800] it is required of stewards to be found faithful God wants us to faithfully do the best with what he's
[time=2808] given us he punctuates the point in Matthew 25 when he's talking about three different slaves of a
[time=2816] particular master he draws this parably tells a story he wants us to get the point and so he tells us about a master with three slaves and he's going away on a trip so he gives to the first slave
[time=2827] five talents to the second slave he gives two to the third he gives one he goes away on his trip
[time=2835] and he comes home sometime later and he says well have you guys done and the slave with five talents comes into his presence and he says you had given me five and I've gained five more
[time=2847] and the master looks at him and says well done thou good and what faithful servant
[time=2854] and then you and I walk in there and we're the talent we're the slave with just two talents
[time=2862] and my tendency is to kind of want to back in the room with God and kind of look over my shoulder
[time=2868] because I don't got five more I don't have two more he gave me two I only got two and I want to
[time=2875] kind of coward and hide it underneath my shoulder and say Lord I'm back and I got I got two more talents
[time=2881] you know what God says in Matthew 25 through the parable of the master he says well done thou good
[time=2890] and faithful servant you were given to it's it's to be expected you would return to you have done
[time=2899] well you are faithful and I love knowing that because I'm not as gifted as the next guy and I may not
[time=2906] have as many accomplishments as the next guy the basis upon which God's being pleased with me has
[time=2913] nothing to do with how gifted I am it has everything to do with how faithful I have been to what he has
[time=2919] given to me see it's no big surprise I'm never going to be as famous as Martin Luther or John
[time=2928] Calvin or John MacArthur or Chuck Swindall I'm finding out I'm not even the most famous Russell
[time=2936] Moore in the city of Fort Wayne every time I introduce myself they say transmissions hey what am I and I say no I'm the pastor of Blackhawk and they say oh yeah recocks I say no
[time=2954] rest more you see this is liberating all I got to be is faithful all you've got to be faithful
[time=2970] and you know what you're going to get just as big a commendation before the Lord their first
[time=2977] Corinthians three at the behemoth seat as Martin Luther he's going to say to you well done
[time=2984] now good and faithful servant you know if we were going to stand up here today and introduce a
[time=2994] famous person to you if I was going to stand up and say this ah this morning it's my great privilege
[time=3000] to introduce to you a great man of God what are you expecting me to say
[time=3006] you want to hear about how many books how many radio ministries how many thousands of people
[time=3012] have come to Christ I'd like to suggest something to you that has nothing to do with whether or not he
[time=3020] is a great man of God or a great person of God those are external things and his giftedness
[time=3027] has no necessary connection to his godliness let me prove it for you Samson was a very gifted guy
[time=3034] happened to have been the strongest person to ever live he got his strength as a gift from God he was a spiritual pygmy King Saul very gifted guy big tall handsome charismatic spiritual pygmy try
[time=3048] this one on for size Judas Ascariot read Matthew 10 there he is group with the 12 Jesus doing the
[time=3054] big commissioning of the apostles he says I give you power to cleanse the sick to raise the dead
[time=3060] to heal the leper he got all the same power they did he wasn't even saved there is no connection
[time=3069] between giftedness and godliness Paul said to the church at Corinth you fall behind in no church
[time=3079] for gifts the most gifted church I know of but your carnal your carnal you know what God wants
[time=3089] God wants your faithfulness and let him determine how significant the impact is gonna be because that's
[time=3096] all of him anyway you know what I'm excited about I'm excited about being there at that beam of seat
[time=3105] and I'm excited about seeing Martin Luther I want to see it happen I want to see him evaluate and I want to see I I pray I hope that God just loads the rewards on this guy but I'm also really excited
[time=3117] about seeing some house-wise stand up there right next to him and watch truck loads of blessings
[time=3124] and rewards boom all over their life and truck drivers and accountants and businessmen
[time=3131] see because God is not looking for your accomplishments God is going to evaluate you
[time=3141] upon your faithfulness I hope you feel a little lighter you know what God wants from you
[time=3150] want your heart turn it towards him and he wants you to be faithful
[time=3156] and you know we look a long way we can't find very many analogies of this in our world can we
[time=3163] because if we take this same wonderful guy that helped us at McDonald's yesterday
[time=3169] and we put him out there on the turf at Notre Dame coach is going to look at him and say man you
[time=3178] got a great heart kid and you're doing the best you can do with what you've got but we're not going
[time=3186] to give you a green jersey you're off the team you know make the cut we could take the same wonderful
[time=3196] kid down there at McDonald's we could run him up to Harvard Law School and his professor is going
[time=3202] to say hey you got a great heart and you know what you're really doing all you can do based upon your
[time=3210] ability but we can't admit you you can't come here and some of you are facing situations in your
[time=3221] life where you're afraid to death that your employer is going to walk through the door and say hey pal
[time=3227] I know you're doing this with your whole heart and I really think you're doing the best you can do
[time=3233] but you're fired and it weird you can't find this stuff anyplace but God let me tell you something
[time=3243] God is never going to say to you you're you're giving me your heart and you're trying your hardest
[time=3251] you're trying to be faithful with what I've given you but you're cut now he's going to say well done
[time=3258] well done from the bottom of his heart we say well done now good and faithful servant
[time=3274] one of the things that additionally convinces me of this beyond even the proof of the word of God is that when I look at my children the last thing in the world I'm worried about
[time=3284] is whether or not they're leaving leading perfect lives or whether the most gifted kid in the class
[time=3292] when they make their mistakes I'm listening for one thing confession a heart that's turning back
[time=3300] a grateful heart a sensitive heart and when I feel and sense that heart in them my heart wants to burst with joy when I watch them perform in athletics or in the classroom or whatever arena they
[time=3315] find themselves in all I need to know is that they're trying their best they're being faithful
[time=3323] and my heart burst with joy isn't just the same way that's how God's heart is for you you are his
[time=3330] child he wants to know that your heart is with him and that you're being faithful that's pretty good
[time=3338] father help strip from our lives the false impressions we have of you
[time=3349] the scowling face that we often see when our eyes are closed and we're falling asleep at night and we
[time=3357] feel your displeasure instead of your pleasure strip out of our lives the external components of
[time=3364] performance and all that stuff and let us know your grace a fresh and a new let us know the peace
[time=3375] that we have with you and father we even pray for the young man of McDonald's and
[time=3386] God I don't know I don't know where he gets that or why he's that way but help us to be just like him and even for the opportunity to talk with him about Christ
[time=3398] help us Lord to convey this kind of unconditional love to those who are in our world help us to treat each other this way and show the character of God
[time=3410] and make us the stronger for it we pray this in Christ name Amen
