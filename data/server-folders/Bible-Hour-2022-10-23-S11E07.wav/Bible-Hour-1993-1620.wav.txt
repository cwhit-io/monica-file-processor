[time=0] I started discipling him and that was about, in a strict discipling relationship, meeting
[time=16] regularly teaching the Word of God, looking at the quality of his life, calling him to higher levels of commitment and ministry involvement for about eight years.
[time=27] Then suddenly it became obvious that we had passed that stage in our relationship and then it was just brother to brother, heart to heart, friend to friend, and in many ways he has discipled me as his heart, that same heart that I met so many years ago in my
[time=43] office has been a challenge to me and it still is to this day.
[time=47] And so in many ways having Kelly here today is a great, great stepping stone in our relationship
[time=53] for me to say to him, "Will you come and fill my pulpit and let me sit down in the audience
[time=59] and be ministered to as you preach the Word of God?" It's all part of that.
[time=63] Second Timothy, two, two thing where you find faithful individuals, invest in them and then they invest another man.
[time=81] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=89] find to be an encouragement.
[time=91] Thank you for joining us.
[time=93] Do you ever experience crisis in your day-to-day life?
[time=96] Do the trials and pressures of life ever rear their head unexpectedly, increasing the
[time=102] tension and turmoil in your soul?
[time=105] Do you ever struggle with conflict in your home, at work, or even at church?
[time=110] Of course you do.
[time=111] You're human, sinful, and you live in a fallen world.
[time=116] Join us today as Kelly Bird, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore, fills our pulpit.
[time=122] We'll be looking at Daniel, chapter 2, and we'll be considering a biblical blueprint for crisis management.
[time=130] Our special music today will be provided by Michelle Smankens and Kevin Rowe.
[time=139] Let's join our service.
[time=162] Let's join us today as Kelly Bird, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore, a former
[time=182] disciple and associate of Pastor Moore, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore.
[time=190] Thank you for joining us today as Kelly Bird, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore,
[time=207] a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore.
[time=236] Let's join us today as Kelly Bird, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore, a former
[time=261] disciple and associate of Pastor Moore.
[time=275] Let's join us today as Kelly Bird, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore, a former
[time=303] disciple and associate of Pastor Moore, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore,
[time=348] Moore, a former disciple and associate of Pastor Moore, a former disciple and associate
[time=372] of Pastor Moore.
[time=387] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=389] This has been already an exciting morning with some good music and we have a special guest as our speaker today and I want to refer to our pastor, Pastor Russ.
[time=400] He's a good friend of yours, tell us a little bit about our speaker.
[time=403] Well, it's an exciting day for me, Pete, as you know because Kelly Bird and I have known each other for about 11 years and he came into my office when I was a pastor at Grace Community
[time=414] Church.
[time=415] I was still really in the ministry, a young man myself and being discipled by other men at that time in my life and yet this other young man, Kelly Bird, about 6 foot 7, came through
[time=426] my door and said, "You know, I really believe that God wants me to be in the ministry and I want to serve him but I need help in my own personal life and in my character and I want
[time=436] you to help me become the man of God that he would have me be." And so with fear and trepidation, I agreed to do that and we met on a regular basis, studied the Word together, prayed together, played basketball together and had fun as well but there was the consistent investment of my life in his life and the joy of that is he's
[time=455] been so faithful, he's so capable and so gifted and has really desired to grow and he's done that.
[time=461] Or else you're a pastor so that seems for most people watching that's a natural thing to do to disciple someone else and encourage them in spiritual things.
[time=470] How have we been working as a church to relate this to lay people?
[time=475] That's right.
[time=476] I don't think it's only the pastor's responsibility to disciple other people.
[time=480] Now if you read the New Testament you'll find the instruction to women is to give their lives to younger women and the same thing would be true of men whether you're not a pastor.
[time=488] And we've had some exciting progression in our church to see that start to catch on and watch the people who are one step ahead of the person behind them turn around and give them a little piece of their faith and love and attention.
[time=499] Well we certainly are thankful for a number of our lay people who are very faithful not only to the church but to the Lord in their ministry and their testimony in the workplace and that
[time=510] is a thrust that I think is very important in our church and I'm looking forward to hearing Kelly speak.
[time=516] We've heard so much about him and I'm sure that that young man is going to do a great job.
[time=522] And speaking of the message I want to remind you that we have a book called The Quest for Character and Kelly Bird is going to speak on that very topic today.
[time=531] It's very timely and this book is being offered on the Bible hour and you can receive it by sending a donation to us.
[time=538] It's an excellent book by Charles Swindall and just a good study on how God works with the
[time=544] Christian to chisel away at his life, to file it, to sand it down and to refine it.
[time=551] And certainly all of us need some instruction in that area.
[time=554] If you'd like to send us a donation today we'd be glad to send you this book.
[time=558] You can simply request the book The Quest for Character by writing to the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=570] It's again right to the Bible hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne Indiana, and the zip code
[time=577] is 46815.
[time=578] We go back to the live broadcast now as we hear music from Kevin Rowe and again it's on
[time=585] the title of God performing a miracle in the Christian's life.
[time=593] There is a man inside of me who wants to have his way, I cannot comply, I relinquish this
[time=619] heart of mine, Lord I am desperate for your handy work, I'm ready for the change, look
[time=630] into my heart, give me a heart for you, it was for my joy, you endure the cross and
[time=643] I am overwhelmed, I want my rules to turn for you, not for myself, let my eyes be fixed
[time=658] on the hope that cannot fail, may my life be set where the hammer meets the nail, place
[time=672] my feet where the rubber meets the roll, shake my heart, please your eyes low, I may
[time=688] live my life where the chisel meets the storm, fill my mind with images of what you want
[time=708] of me, the path that I must take, less time lose my way, all my home is in your sovereignty,
[time=723] my destiny to be faithful before your face, to serve at the throne of grace, when evil comes
[time=736] to cloud my sight and lure me away, I will not be distracted from this holy place, let
[time=750] my eyes be fixed on the hope that cannot fail, may my life be set where the hammer meets
[time=763] the nail, place my feet where the rubber meets the roll, shake my life, be for you low,
[time=783] I may live my life where the chisel meets the storm, chip away what tries to hide the
[time=803] truth until there is a remarkable resemblance of you, let my eyes be fixed on the hope that
[time=820] cannot fail, may my life be set where the hammer meets the nail, place my feet where the
[time=838] hammer, shake my heart, please your eyes low, I may live my life where the chisel meets
[time=855] the storm, I'm on the way.
[time=881] Amen, and I agree, Kevin, thank you, that's a wonderful song, isn't it?
[time=885] Where the hammer meets the nail and where the rubber meets the road and where the chisel meets the stone, in essence, do anything you've got to do to me to make me into the image of Christ, I know that's your prayer.
[time=900] About 11 years ago, when I was just recently on staff at Grace Community Church and as I was
[time=907] being the recipient of a lot of godly men on that staff investing their life in mine and
[time=913] teaching me about 2 Timothy 2 2 where it says to entrust your life to faithful men that they in turn would entrust it to others, this rather large individual walked into my office and shut the door and sat down and he introduced himself to me as Kelly Bird and I had heard about Kelly Bird because he was out at the Masters College 6 foot 7 star basketball
[time=935] player, captain of the team, student body president and a Bible major, anticipating future ministry
[time=942] for the cause of Christ.
[time=945] And so it was kind of an interesting situation and he said to me, "You know, I really want
[time=951] to serve God but there are some major holes in my life, there are some things that are missing
[time=958] in my character and in my perspective about God and in my private life and I don't know
[time=964] how to handle them on my own and he asked me for help." And so for the next 8 years we were involved in a discipleship process where we would meet
[time=975] on a regular basis, we would pray together, we would study the scriptures and most importantly we would then take those times and talk about his life and my life and iron began to sharpen
[time=986] iron and God has been in the process of through my efforts and the efforts of many other men
[time=993] and the spirit of God shaping Kelly Bird into a person that really reflects the character
[time=999] and the heart and the passion of Christ.
[time=1002] He, when working at the Masters College after he graduated from there was attending the Master's Seminary, he ran a dorm for us, it was Hachkis dorm and this pretty, gorgeous young freshman
[time=1015] girl from Washington came to the college and she caught his eye and they began to build
[time=1022] a gathering relationship and eventually she even lived with us, Kebra and lived with us for six months and so my wife had the opportunity to disciple Kebra and she got to watch our family
[time=1033] in action and watch Heidi and they would pray together and study the scriptures and eventually Kelly and Kebra got married and Kelly graduated from seminary, the Master's Seminary and then
[time=1044] we were on staff together at a different church, foothill church out there in California and
[time=1050] then when I came to serve here at Blackhawk Kelly went on to a different church, Grace Baptist Church, a church of over several thousand people where Kelly is an associate pastor there
[time=1061] of the college ministry, young married and the singles ministry and God is blessing his
[time=1067] ministry there and on many occasions the senior pastor there, Tom Givens is out speaking
[time=1073] in various places and Kelly has been a favorite of that family as he would fill the pulpit in Tom's absence and so this morning it's kind of a privilege for me to introduce Kelly
[time=1084] to you and it's a step ahead in our relationship really, as about eight years ago it changed
[time=1090] from kind of a disciple to disciple relationship to one of just genuine friendship and mutual accountability
[time=1097] and as Kelly's heart continues to challenge my own to be a person of God and so I think the
[time=1103] disciple lead disciple thing went away and now we're just good friends but it really is a privilege
[time=1109] to be able to open my pulpit to him and to expose him to you, the people that I've grown
[time=1115] to love and care for here for Wayne and so would you give a warm Blackhawk Baptist Church
[time=1122] welcome to Kelly and his wife, Kebra Bert. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.
[time=1137] So this is Indiana weather, huh? This is great. Listen to Russ on the phone and you think it was always rainy and cloudy. This is beautiful. It's really nice to be here with you folks
[time=1149] this morning. I just wanted to say to you briefly and I was here last November and was able to share it with a few of you but wanted to just say to you all publicly this morning, how thankful we are for you. There's so many people in California that miss and love the
[time=1165] more so deeply and to know and for me to see here in this family and in this church ministry, to see how you have welcomed them into your families, to see how you have invited them into this fellowship, to see how you care and love them, care for them and love them has been so encouraging for Kebra and I and just wanted to say thank you for that. It means an awful lot to us. It's a huge encouragement to see them happy and a part of such a wonderful place like Blackhawk Baptist. It's great to see Russ and Heidi and you can't say Russ and Heidi and the girls anymore. Russ and Heidi and the girls and Bobby, so fun to see them.
[time=1198] I've got to tell you a little bit about Russ and Heidi before we jump into our discussion this morning. It's been an interesting road these last 12, 13 years. You know, about 12, 13 years ago, Heidi got pregnant with their first baby and they were so excited. Everybody
[time=1211] was excited and I think most of the folks prayed for a healthy baby but I think there was probably a little bit of just very private, very private, prayerful thoughts that it might
[time=1224] be a little boy but God gave him Randy and what a great thing that was. What a joy Randy was to them and what a joy she's been and she's grown up to be a beautiful young lady and you all know that and then a couple of years later Heidi got pregnant again and I think it kind of moved from the realm of thoughtful, prayerful thoughts to just personal, private prayer on individuals parts for a boy and God gave him Nikki and you all know Nikki and
[time=1249] how much fun she is and the personality that she brings to that home and the blessing that she has been and we were as excited as everyone else and then Heidi got pregnant
[time=1259] again. And we kind of moved from the realm of thoughtful, private, thoughtful prayer to
[time=1265] private individual prayer and I think with the third one we kind of went to small group prayer. Now it was okay to kind of publicly but in small groups pray for God's blessing
[time=1275] of a young boy more and God gave him Kelly in and we were excited and they were excited
[time=1281] and again you know Kelly and her excitement and her smile and again God blessed them with
[time=1288] a wonderful young lady. Then Heidi got pregnant again she's been pregnant an awful lot in
[time=1294] our relationship and she got pregnant again and I think at that point we kind of had gone
[time=1300] to the gamut and now we were moving into a national prayer chain. We were calling across
[time=1306] the country inviting people to join us in prayer for a little boy and God gave him Whitney and you know Whitney better than we know Whitney and you know and I've seen in these last few days what an exciting fun, personable little girl she is and we pray God and thank God
[time=1321] as they did for her and her life. And then Heidi got pregnant again and they're in Indiana
[time=1327] and we all just said stop praying. Don't pray anymore pray for Russ and Heidi that they'll stop the insanity and I think God answered that prayer and he gave him Bobby, Robert Russell
[time=1345] and that's come so much fun to see him and to see the girls and him and Russ and Heidi
[time=1352] and him and he's so big and he's so long and thick and you look at his dad and you can't
[time=1359] quite figure that out but you're thankful anyway that he's there and you're thankful for his life and you're thankful for that family I know you are and it's so nice to be able to see them again and again to be here this morning. Let me ask you a question if I can as
[time=1374] we start our time off here this morning. A question that I've got to believe is I hope it is relevant, I hope it's practical for you I know as I ask myself this question it's a question that I need to ask myself because of the realities of my own life. How do you
[time=1389] deal with crisis? Be honest ask yourself this morning how do you respond to crisis in your
[time=1399] own life in the workplace at home with family and spouses when real pressure settles in and
[time=1409] the flame of expectations and responsibilities or maybe even the unexpected is turned up.
[time=1416] How do you respond? We all face it don't we? You face it I face it the things that make life at times very difficult and very challenging. How do you as a believer deal with crisis? How
[time=1429] do you as a Christian deal with the unexpected in your life? In the midst of an unbelieving godless world that at times is watching your every move, your every response. How do you as
[time=1441] a Christian tend to respond in crisis in difficulty and in trial? Ask yourself again this morning
[time=1448] if you would. Are you too often in the midst of crisis too often quick to speak? Maybe too
[time=1455] often at times to want to go and just do your own thing to fix the thing, to get it out
[time=1461] of your life, to get it out of your way, to go and do your own thing to remove it from your existence. Are you too often easily irritated in the midst of crisis personal turmoil? Do
[time=1475] you find yourself at times increasingly self-centered? Do you find yourself at times prone to panic?
[time=1483] And what do you do with the Lord in the midst of crisis? What happens there in your relationship
[time=1489] with Him? Where does that go? How does that work in the midst of the unexpected crisis of our life? Well, in your humaneness and in your fallenness and in your sinfulness, if you're
[time=1500] anything like me, you would answer yes to all of the above. And at our best, maybe several
[time=1508] of the things just mentioned. And I know I can speak for myself and I would guess again I can speak for you that in the area of handling and grappling with crisis and the unexpected
[time=1519] in our life, we need a lot of help. I know I do. And in light of that need for help in my
[time=1526] life, I'm encouraged about our passage this morning. If you've got your Bible, open with me to Daniel chapter 2. Daniel chapter 2 verses 17 to 49. I'm encouraged about our
[time=1537] passage this morning because in it, we see Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach, Meshach,
[time=1544] they've been to go modeling powerfully for you and I, a mature, strong, godly approach
[time=1552] to crisis. We see them as young teenagers. Many scholars put their age at anywhere between
[time=1558] 13 and 15 years old. These are young boys. These are young, 14 year old boys functioning in
[time=1566] a far off land living under the tyrannical rule of a godless king and in the midst of it
[time=1572] all, evidencing a level of character and integrity and commitment that is astounding not to mention
[time=1579] convicting. Real briefly, let's just get some background. Okay, and look at chapter 1. I'm sorry. Just flip back a page and let's just make sure we understand where we find these four young men as we come to chapter 2. It says there in verse 1 of Daniel chapter 1.
[time=1593] In the third year of the reign of Jehoyakim, king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. And the Lord gave Jehoyakim king of Judah into his hand
[time=1604] along with some of the vessels of the house of God. And he brought them, Nebuchadnezzar,
[time=1610] to the land of Shainar, to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasury of his god, then the king ordered Aspenas, the chief of his officials, to bring in some
[time=1622] of the sons of Israel, including some of the royal family and of the nobles. Stop there,
[time=1628] let me just talk us through the rest. Nebuchadnezzar comes in and takes Jehoyakim, takes vessels from the temple and brings them back to Babylon. 13 to 1500 miles away and along
[time=1640] with that he brings it says young men and it goes on in these next few verses to talk about how he wanted for himself and for his service and for his benefit and for his palace and
[time=1651] for his court. He wanted young men, it says they were the best looking young men, the finest young men, the most talented, the most gifted and he takes these kids and he kidnaps them.
[time=1662] He takes them hostage away from their family, away from their friends, away from their home
[time=1668] and he takes them to Babylon where he does what? He changes their names. He teaches them
[time=1675] a new language. He teaches them new customs. He teaches them new literature. He attempts
[time=1682] to completely change who they are so that they will no longer serve their God but that they would serve him and be loyal to him and give themselves to him. If you've studied
[time=1694] the book of Daniel, if you've read through the story especially in these first few chapters, you know that that did not work. These young men stood strong. They stood firm on the foundation
[time=1706] that had been laid for them. They changed their names. They learned a new language. They took on new customs but they refused to compromise who they were. Babylonian brainwashing as he
[time=1719] attempted to thrust it upon them did not work in the end.
[time=1724] Let's look back now. Chapter 2, we're going to try our best to make it through verses 17 to 49
[time=1730] and we're going to just call it character, character in the midst of crisis. How does Daniel
[time=1736] respond? I want you to note and we'll try and look at three things this morning. Three responses that Daniel has to crisis and I want to again just set it up briefly by going back to verse 12 and reading through verse 16, chapter 2. Because of this, the king became
[time=1751] indignant and very furious and gave orders to destroy all the wise men of Babylon. So the
[time=1757] decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they looked for Daniel and his friends to kill them and that doesn't mean they were looking for Daniel and his friends so they could go and kill the wise men. What it means in the Hebrew as you look at that is that Daniel and his friends would be killed as well. They were going to be slain. Nebuchadnezzar was furious and so they're all going to die. Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment
[time=1784] to Ariac, the captain of the king's bodyguard who had gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
[time=1790] He answered and said to Ariac the king's commander, "For what reason is the decree from the king so urgent than Ariac informed Daniel about the matter?" So Daniel went in and requested
[time=1801] of the king that he would give him time in order that he might declare the interpretation
[time=1807] to the king. So Nebuchadnezzar has had a dream. It's been very confusing for him. He can't understand it. He doesn't even know what he dreamed really, doesn't know what to make of it and he wants his magicians and his conjurers and the guys in his court, the wise men, to come in and tell him what he dreamed and to interpret the dream for him and nobody can do it. And he's furious. He's angry. He wants them all killed and Daniel finds out. Daniel
[time=1833] calmly requests time to do what. Did you read it there? To declare the interpretation.
[time=1840] Note, he doesn't say, "Give me time so I can figure this thing out on my own. Give me some time so I can go and make this interpretation myself." He doesn't say that. He doesn't say
[time=1852] that because he knows better at age 13 or 14 or 15. He knows and understands fully that
[time=1858] the source of direction and wisdom in the midst of crisis is not himself. And with that,
[time=1864] we come to our first point. The first stop on the path to maturity in the midst of crisis.
[time=1870] Look and see if you can see it there in verses 17 and 18 of Daniel chapter 2.
[time=1877] In Daniel, it says, "went to his house and informed his friends, Hanna Naya Mishail and Azaraya about the matter, in order that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning
[time=1889] this mystery so that Daniel and his friends might not be destroyed with the rest of the wise
[time=1895] men of Babylon." Did you see it? The first step in the middle of life-threatening, serious
[time=1904] crisis. What was the first thing that came to their mind? What was the first thing that
[time=1910] they did? They prayed. They prayed. And you say to me, Kelly, is that it? That's your first
[time=1919] point. They prayed. They prayed. The very first thing, the very first attitude, the very
[time=1930] first act, was to get down on their knees and ask God for help, for assistance, for direction.
[time=1939] The first thing wasn't to rush off and find the newest book on crazed kings in their dreams.
[time=1946] Wasn't where they went. The very first thing wasn't to huddle together together their own perspectives on the matter. The very first thing they did was not to run and consult the experts
[time=1957] on what it all meant. It wasn't even to come together and form an escape plan if things got crazy. Not that there would be anything wrong with them or you and I going in the midst of crisis and reading a book. Not that there would be anything wrong with consulting the experts or talking amongst ourselves for the sake of gathering perspective. But what's
[time=1978] the first thing that they did? They got on their knees and prayed and asked for God's
[time=1986] help for His wisdom and His discernment. What's the first thing typically that you do? Ask
[time=1993] yourself this morning. What is the first thing in the midst of real crisis that you typically
[time=1999] do? More importantly, maybe what attitude do you typically initially evidence when things
[time=2006] get a little bit crazy? Do words like irritated, angry, tense, frustrated, bothered, shut
[time=2023] down, withdrawn, selfish? Words like that come to your mind. They do mine. I have to admit
[time=2035] to you those are the words, those are the attitudes that more often than not come to my mind when I think about what my initial response is to crisis. Wouldn't it be nice if our response
[time=2049] and I ask myself and maybe you do too, why is it that way? Why isn't it trusting? Why
[time=2056] don't words like that come to my mind? Why isn't it dependent? Why isn't it faithful?
[time=2061] Why isn't it giving? And the best answer I can come up with is that I think at the core
[time=2068] of who you are and who I am. In our again, in our fallenness, we want so desperately to
[time=2075] have people, relationships, husbands, wives, children, friends, and situations. We want
[time=2083] so desperately for them to be what we want them to be, what they maybe should be, but we want so deeply for things in our life to be the way we want them to be and when crisis
[time=2095] comes into our life. When the unexpected happens, when turmoil and conflict rear their head,
[time=2103] we lose what? Control of it all. And boy, we don't like that. You don't like that. I don't
[time=2111] like that. And so we fight, and we scrap, and we claw to get it back. And we aren't trusting,
[time=2119] and we aren't dependent, and we aren't faithful. We are irritated, angry, bothered, frustrated,
[time=2126] shut down. Daniel evidence is here, a deep trust, a deep reliance on God in the face of
[time=2135] trial that should be a challenge to each of us. Have you experienced crisis in your life
[time=2142] recently? Do you anticipate one soon? Sometimes we can see him coming, can't we? Sometimes
[time=2150] we can't. Maybe you're here this morning in the midst of one. Maybe you're here this
[time=2156] morning sitting in your seat and you're smiling and singing, but on the inside you're hurting
[time=2162] and you're frustrated and you're confused, and crisis has engulfed your life. How willing
[time=2169] do you find yourself to initially, in attitude and act, take the issue and thoroughly, genuinely
[time=2175] give it over to the Lord in wholehearted, trust, and dependence? And it's sad, I think,
[time=2182] for me. I'll speak for myself that something so vital and something so foundational to what God has said. Something so important to your life and mind, prayer, has become sometimes
[time=2193] in our circles. Something so simple and so trite and so taken for granted. I say my first
[time=2201] point, prayer and you say, and I even say to myself, that's it. That's it. And that's powerful.
[time=2208] That's meaningful. And it represents a path, I believe, we need to be willing to walk initially
[time=2214] in attitude and act that we would give our needs and our desires to God, not just once, but
[time=2220] in an ongoing pattern. Well, as Daniel responded in this way, what happened? What was the result
[time=2226] of him praying? Look at verse 19 through verse 23. "Then the mystery," it says, "was revealed
[time=2232] to Daniel. In a night vision, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven. Daniel answered, and he said, 'Let the name of God be blessed forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong to him, and it was he, and it is he who changes the times and the epochs. He removes kings and establishes
[time=2249] kings. He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding. It is he who reveals
[time=2255] the profound and hidden things. He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him, to the O God of my Father's, I give thanks and praise, for thou hast given me wisdom
[time=2266] and power. Even now thou hast made known to me what we requested of thee, for thou hast made
[time=2272] known to us the kings matter." Sound like your 14-year-olds prayer? What a kid, huh? What
[time=2281] a hard-for-god and what a perspective. In this particular situation, now watch this. In
[time=2287] this case, God answers immediately and specifically exactly what Daniel had petitioned. He honors
[time=2296] Daniel's prayerful attitude by specifically answering Daniel's petition. Now am I the
[time=2302] only one in the room this morning that wishes God worked like this in the midst of prayer
[time=2309] more often? Am I alone in that? I don't think so. We would love it if God was always very
[time=2315] faithful and quick to answer in a timely fashion, specifically what we requested. And that's
[time=2321] great that it happened for Daniel. Saved his life. God blessed him in that fashion, but you know what? It's not the point, and I don't want you to walk away with the fact that he prayed and got answered it. I want you to walk away this morning with the fact that he prayed, that he was willing to initially, in attitude and act, take a posture and a position
[time=2341] of prayer. The answer is great, but not key to what we're trying to communicate. You think of Abraham in the Old Testament? He wanted so desperately to have a what? A son, a little
[time=2354] boy, God had promised him that. Do you think in his 99 years prior to having the boy that think he ever prayed for a son? I bet he did. I would have. I bet he prayed for a son
[time=2367] and God said, "No, not now, not at this time, not at this place." But he was willing to pray, I bet. I think about Jesus, we know he prayed in the garden of Gesemini. The night
[time=2378] he was going to be betrayed. He prayed a prayer. Remember what he said? Remember what he asked for? But if it would be within the parameters of God's will that the torment and the torture
[time=2388] and the pain and the suffering would somehow maybe be able to pass from him and what did God say? No. God doesn't always answer prayers like this. You know that, and I know that,
[time=2400] there has to be. There needs to be a willingness in your heart and mind to respond in that fashion.
[time=2408] Back to Daniel's response in crisis, number one, he prayed. Number two, look at verse 24 of
[time=2414] chapter two, says, "Therefore, Daniel, he's received this from the Lord, and Daniel went
[time=2421] into area whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon. He went and spoke
[time=2427] to him as follows. First thing out of Daniel's mouth since his life has now been saved. First
[time=2433] thing, do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. I would
[time=2444] suggest to you this morning that the second thing we see in Daniel's life as he responds to crisis is that he remained others centered. He remained others centered. I'll tell you
[time=2457] what, when crisis or turmoil hits my life, guess who tends to be the first individual I
[time=2464] think about. Can you answer for me? Me, myself. And here are the questions that I tend to
[time=2472] ask in the midst of my crisis. How will this crisis affect me? What will this crisis do
[time=2482] to my plans and my desires and what I want to have happen? How can I minimize the discomfort
[time=2491] in the midst of this to me personally?" As a young seminary student, I wrote down a quote
[time=2498] one day. It cannot for the life of me remember what Professor said it, but it impacted me.
[time=2504] And I scribbled it down fast and I've kept it for years. And he was talking about measuring
[time=2510] and gauging real character and when you and I should really do that with someone. And he
[time=2516] said this, "To gauge and measure the true character and compassion of a man, observe him
[time=2524] not at times of personal ease or when life flows as it has been planned. But instead, view
[time=2531] and evaluate him when things and plans have gone awry, when the unexpected and unwanted
[time=2537] complications have trashed his plans and forced him to deal a fresh with the people and circumstances
[time=2545] around him." That's a good quote. And it says a lot to me. And I hope it says a lot to
[time=2553] you about where it really matters in your life and mind. So you don't judge your character
[time=2559] or mine or Russell's or anyone that you know. You never judge an individual's character by what they do in public, by what they do in life is good. You judge and see the true
[time=2570] character of a man and a woman by what they do in private and by how they handle themselves
[time=2578] in the midst of real conflict and crisis. Daniel does a great job of modeling for you and
[time=2584] I others centered thinking. I myself, I don't do such a great job. I don't know what you
[time=2592] all do in Fort Wayne for the Fourth of July. I don't know if there's any big traditions or things that you enjoy as a family. But boy, we really enjoy in, this is going to sound
[time=2602] so cliche. We enjoy going to the beach in California on the Fourth of July. My wife and I have several families and friends, seven, eight couples. We always go to the beach on Fourth of July. We've been doing it for years. And we get our tents out, camp at the campsite and enjoy the beach for the three or four days, whatever it is. And just have a great time.
[time=2622] This year we got invited to go again and we accepted Kiberr's little sisters were visiting from Washington State where she grew up and it fell on a weekend. So I had church responsibilities
[time=2632] that I had to be a part of. So what I did was thinking it would be fun for them and enjoyable for her. I said, "You know what? Why don't we bar to truck from some friends?" And I said, "Why don't we pack up the girls and you and get all the food and all the tents and all that stuff?" And why don't you guys just go down to the beach early and have a great time and just enjoy yourself. And I'll keep, oh, I didn't tell you. We've got an 18-month-old
[time=2657] little boy named Russell. And he doesn't look anything like this Russell but he's an awesome
[time=2664] little guy and we love him a lot and we named him after Russell. And anyway, I'll keep Russell
[time=2671] I said. And I thought that was very sensitive of me. And she said, "Great!" And so she just
[time=2679] did a great job. She got the truck pack. I helped maybe a little bit and she got the truck pack, got the girls pack, got the food pack, got everything in the truck. We got directions for her down to San Clemente State Beach. And, you know, she's from Washington state, you know, kind of back roads, country, kind of things. So it doesn't always do really well in LA on the freeways but she did a bang up job, got them down there, got the tents put up, got
[time=2705] the food unpacked, got the girls all settled, and just did a phenomenal job. And I was back at home with Russell, little Russell. We were having a good time. He and I get along great anytime. And this is the truth. Anytime I spend a prolonged period of time with him,
[time=2721] my respect and admiration for my wife increases. And he and I had a great time, little rough,
[time=2727] little rocky at times, but we did well to get through the weekend and Sunday came and went to church. And then he and I were off to the beach. And even though we did well during the weekend, I think by Sunday afternoon now we're cruising to the beach. I think he's a little bit tired of me. And I'll be honest, I was a little tired of him. And he starts to
[time=2748] cry with about 45 minutes to go. And he's not hungry, he's not hurt, you know, they just
[time=2755] tired. He just wants to get out of the stupid seat and say just drive it along and he starts to cry and cry and cry and get louder and louder. And he's cranky and fussy. I'm cranky and fussy. And I'm starting to think and here's what's going on in my head. I can't wait
[time=2773] to get to the beach. And I'll just be honest, I can't wait to not hear this anymore. I can't
[time=2779] wait. I'm looking forward to seeing my wife, granite, but I can't wait to get in the ocean
[time=2785] and body surf and boogie board. I can't wait to get in the sand. I can't wait to have my turkey sandwich and my snapple. I can't wait to sit in my lounge chair and be done with
[time=2795] this weekend. And so I drove faster. And he cried louder. And we finally got to the exit
[time=2802] to San Clemente off the interstate five there. We pulled off and then it hit me, something else. I'm realizing because we've done this so often that there's a very tricky thing about to happen. I'm about to approach the guard booth with the Ranger. And it's going to be very important to my plan that Kebra had thought ahead because she knows I don't
[time=2824] carry cash. And she knows the way it works there that you need a day pass to park in the parking
[time=2831] lot that allows you just to park and get right down to the beach. Because she knows, and I'm banking on the fact that she knows if she doesn't do that, I get a 15 minute pass
[time=2841] with strict instructions to go to a different lot where I have to walk further to the trail, which is three quarters of a mile down to the beach where 18 million people are for that weekend. Find her somehow get six bucks from her walk back up to the car, go back to the boot. I don't want to do that. It's not inviting to me at all. He's crying louder. I want out.
[time=2862] She had better come through. Drive up to the thing. Nine cars. We wait there for 20 minutes
[time=2868] while he cries and does this in the car seat. And we finally get there. And I ask the inevitable question. And I get the inevitable answer. Sorry, Mr. Bird. No day pass here. Rips off the
[time=2881] tag. Tapes that I'm in front of my window. That'll be a 15 minute. I said I understand why I was gone. And I was mad. Bothered. Sinfully. Bothered. Drove over to the 15 minute deal. He's
[time=2895] doing this. I'm trying to get his bathing suit on him. I'm trying to get the sunscreen on him. Because she'll ask. Did you put sunscreen on him? And I'll say yes. Trying to get the towels
[time=2904] out of the back. Trying to try. I'm getting changed in the car. Ten and windows down below the steering wheel. He's looking at me like what are you doing? I'm picking him up. I'm grabbing the towels. We're a mess. And we're walking down. There's the trail. Three quarters of a mile down. Almost straight down. I'm slipping. I'm sliding. I'm angry. And I'm thinking to myself,
[time=2924] you had better. Be careful. And we make it down to the beach. I see you all smiling. You've
[time=2931] all been there. I mean, not the beach. And I look down the beach and there everybody is.
[time=2937] I made it. There's all my friends. The day tensor up. The kids are playing. They're out in the waves. There's my beautiful, lovely wife. Her little sisters. And they are racing toward me. They're so happy to see me. And we embrace briefly. And she says hello. And
[time=2958] the first thing out of my mouth, isn't boy, it's good to see you. I'm so, come here. I'm
[time=2969] so proud of you. You did a great job. You're here. I saw the tents there up. You got down
[time=2977] here on your own. You've done great with the girls. I'm so glad. I'm so happy to see you.
[time=2983] And I'm so proud of what you've accomplished. Not anything close. The first thing out of
[time=2989] my mouth and I don't say it to be funny was, gosh, it didn't do the parking thing real
[time=2997] well. And her countenance and her face just dropped. And guys, you've been there. You know,
[time=3009] when you lose eye contact, and you're not quite sure where they went, well, I knew where she'd gone. And she just kind of kicked it the sand. She took rustle from me. She gave
[time=3020] him to her sister. And without looking at me, she said, you know what? Why don't you just
[time=3027] go play? Have fun and go ahead and do your thing. She reached in the diaper bag and she pulled
[time=3034] out the keys to the car. She walked down the beach. She walked and I let her do it. Another
[time=3040] bad move. Up the trail, down the car, got in the car, drove to the booth, paid the six bucks
[time=3047] of the car back, down the trail, down the beach. Says an awful lot about my wife that I'm
[time=3057] very happy to share with you. It says an awful lot about me that is embarrassing. I didn't
[time=3065] handle my crisis very well. Maybe you don't either when it comes to remaining others centered
[time=3071] in your life in the mist of real difficulty. I hope I can grow and mature.
[time=3077] After receiving the interpretation of the dream and having his prayer answered powerfully, not to mention timely, did you notice the first thing out of his mouth? Did he say, "Ariak,
[time=3088] I've got it. I figured it out. I'm saved. My crisis is over." Is that what he said? Is
[time=3095] that what he said? No. Did he say, "Ariak, take me to the king." That was the second thing
[time=3101] he said. But the first thing out of his mouth was don't kill the wise men. What about them?
[time=3106] Are they going to be okay? In the midst of crisis, he remained the other centered. Reminds
[time=3112] of anybody in the Bible, any key, focal figure. Reminds me of Jesus. Reminds me of Jesus
[time=3119] on the cross. When in the midst of a crisis that you or I will never identify with, in the
[time=3126] midst of pain and suffering that you and I will never come close to, he said, "Father,
[time=3132] wipe these idiots off the face of the earth. They've hurt me." Did he say that? He didn't
[time=3139] did he? He said, "Father, forgive these people, these poor, dear, clueless people. They have no idea what they're doing. Forgive them. Be there for them. God help us. You and I to be
[time=3151] more willing to forego our rights and let go of our demand that life or people be exactly
[time=3159] like we want them to be." One more thing and we're going to close. I want you to notice number three. In the midst of crisis, Daniel looks for and takes opportunity to shift the thought
[time=3172] and focus to the Lord. He takes opportunity to shift the thought and focus to the Lord. Look
[time=3179] at verses 25 to 28. Then Ariac hurriedly brought Daniel into the King's presence and spoke
[time=3185] to him as follows. "I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation
[time=3191] known to the King." The King answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belta Shazar, "Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?" And here
[time=3203] it is, verse 27. Daniel answered before the King and said, "As for the mystery about which
[time=3209] the King has inquired, neither wise men, conjurers, magicians, nor diviners are able to declare
[time=3215] it to the King. However, verse 28, there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries and he
[time=3223] has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will take place in the latter days. This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed. It's not me, Nebuchadnezzar. I didn't
[time=3234] come up with this, the God in heaven who knows all and tells all and who has full and complete control of everything. He knows what you dreamed and he's helped me make this interpretation."
[time=3245] "Bold, brave." In the midst of crisis, you and I typically look for two things, I think personally,
[time=3256] two things in the midst of real dilemma. A way out or if we're going to have to be in it, we look for the path of what? Least resistance. Again, look at Daniel. You think he'd just
[time=3268] be happy to be alive. You think he'd just be happy to be saved from the sword, but no.
[time=3275] He's going to inject into the situation. He's going to share with this crazy King at age 13, 1500 miles away from home having just escaped death. He's looking for and taking the opportunity,
[time=3288] not to get out safe or avoid further conflict, but he's taking the opportunity to shift the thought and focus to the one true God. I wish I had those kind of guts. I wish that were me more
[time=3299] often. How about you? In the workplace with the unbelieving community that you know and have
[time=3307] befriended, I hope in some ways, with those in your family that don't know God, that don't
[time=3314] know Christ, friends of yours, how prepared are you? How willing are you? How ready are you to
[time=3324] respond and light of what it says in 1 Peter 315, to be ready to make a defense, to everyone who
[time=3331] asks you to, to give an account for the hope that is within you, with gentleness and with
[time=3337] reverence? I have no idea what you're facing this morning. I have no idea the circumstances
[time=3345] of your life. I talked with the gentleman after the first service whose life is coming unravel,
[time=3351] taking seven days a week, 15 hours a day, frustrated at home, his wife's frustrated, his kids are frustrated,
[time=3359] and he's telling me, you know what, at least this is encouraging. I feel like I've got some things I
[time=3365] can pursue, and I could somewhat identify with him and I bet most of you can too. In some way, in some
[time=3372] area of your life, it would be my prayer this morning that you would have the courage and the
[time=3379] integrity and maybe more than anything, the honesty, to truthfully go to God and say, "God, I need your
[time=3386] help. I need your assistance. I need your direction." Two, in the midst of trying to pursue that path,
[time=3392] not forget the people in your life, and at the same time, when given the right circumstance and
[time=3399] opportunity to not forget God, to be able to, when given the chance, talk about him, refer to him,
[time=3406] and let others know of your trust and relationship with him. Let's pray.
[time=3411] I hope that you found the music inspiring as you listen to soloist Michelle Smekens and Kevin
[time=3420] Rowe. The message today was from our special guest, Kelly Bird. Kelly is an associate pastor at the

[time=3433] made a decision to trust Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, you can take a minute right now and pray this prayer with me. Let's bow together. Dear Heavenly Father, I want to tell you today that I'm
[time=3445] sorry for the sins that I've committed, and I'm thankful that you died on the cross to take care of my sins.
[time=3450] I ask you to forgive me for the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
