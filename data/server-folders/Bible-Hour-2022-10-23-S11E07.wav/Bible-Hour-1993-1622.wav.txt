[time=0] >> Paul wants to talk to you this morning about your valued judgments, not so much with
[time=21] respect to the food you eat, the entertainment that you find, although that may apply.
[time=27] And the kind of dog you want to have, but he wants to talk about the fundamental value system of your life, the lenses you wear to evaluate your life and feel a sense of joy
[time=39] and happiness and purpose in your life, or on the other hand, whether you are full of grief and sorrow and pain and despair and depression.
[time=61] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=67] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=69] Thank you for joining us.
[time=71] Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
[time=74] A person's perspective can make all the difference in the world.
[time=78] The same event, or set of circumstances, can make one man rejoice and fill another man's
[time=85] heart with sorrow.
[time=87] Today in our study of Philippians, Paul calls us to examine our perspective on life, and with that, holds out the hope of knowing true joy.
[time=97] Our special music today will be provided by celebration and Denise Mitchell.
[time=109] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=127] The mighty fortresses are gone, a golden bell of faith.
[time=137] Our bell of faith, our lives are gone, a golden bell of faith.
[time=147] Thank you for joining us today, music and fellowship, music and fellowship, music and fellowship
[time=173] today, music and fellowship, music and fellowship, music and fellowship, music and fellowship
[time=193] from may of God's own true team.
[time=201] God's best to Bethlehem.
[time=205] As Jesus fills his hand, Lord, set her on his way, from age to age, as same.
[time=219] Let him us ring the bell of God.
[time=243] God, Lord, let the God come day to end our life.
[time=259] The secret hand of his hand, Lord, let him us ring the bell of faith.
[time=291] Let us ring the bell of faith, our lives are gone, a golden bell of faith.
[time=311] The secret hand of his hand, Lord, let him us ring the bell of faith.
[time=341] When troubles rise and kitchen unaware, the day to day of living seems unfair.
[time=367] So you try again your hopes and plans but they end up in defeat.
[time=375] The fancy fruits that once fulfilled now lead you incomplete.
[time=385] And you wonder where your life's gone wrong and why you can't find peace.
[time=393] Your hopes not gone, it's been too long since you have to believe.
[time=403] Keep believing in what you know is true.
[time=411] Keep believing you know the Lord will save you through troubles rise in your life and you don't know what to do.
[time=429] Keep believing in what you know is true.
[time=465] So when doubts arise and cloud your mind, my friend don't be deceived.
[time=483] And the knowledge of God's Word, we can stand up and believe.
[time=493] You can take Him at His Lord, He is faithful kind and true.
[time=501] Not a prayer will go an answer in His sight, He'll see you through.
[time=511] Keep believing in what you know is true.
[time=521] Keep believing you know the Lord will save you through troubles rise in your life and you don't know what to do.
[time=529] Keep believing in what you know is true.
[time=585] All we're into the fall of the year again and we welcome you to the Bible hour today.
[time=605] It's not so cold yet that it's very cold but it's changing and then I don't know it seems especially clear and the humidity is gone and there's a sense of change which I'm coming to like and enjoy.
[time=615] I just want to thank you again for joining us for the Bible hour.
[time=619] I appreciate your consistency in staying with us week after week and this is an important time for you to stay with the Bible hour every week because our pastor Russell has begun a new series in the book of Philippians.
[time=631] So Russ you might tell us a little bit about it.
[time=635] Well we're excited about the book in general. I think it is the book and the New Testament that talks most about our emotions.
[time=641] The book we might turn to in the Old Testament to talk about emotions would be the book of Psalms and there it's not so instructive as it is insightful to really let us see the heart of the Psalmist as he goes up and down and through and over his emotions.
[time=655] The book of Philippians is really going to be I think a probing look at our emotions particularly joy as kind of the pinnacle or the hallmark of all Christian emotions human emotions and found most frequently in Christians and how we can pursue true joy in and through very very difficult and trying circumstances.
[time=678] I think Russell there's a very important distinction between the word happiness and the word joy have any.
[time=685] Well the word happiness actually comes from the word happy which is happen stance or happening coincidentally.
[time=695] In other words happiness is the product circumstances that you can't necessarily control that are producing happiness in your life.
[time=703] Joy is not built on circumstances. Joy is built on principles and relationship with God and relationship with Christ that help you see your circumstances in ways with real purpose and with real meaning that can produce genuine joy.
[time=719] I think it's really important because I think we have a misconception sometimes that because we know Christ is our savior and we try to walk with him that our life is just going to be free of all the normal interruptions that.
[time=731] Mine is not like that.
[time=732] Mine is neither and I'm sure that some of that's going to come out as we study the book because it is it is a marvelous book and I'm looking forward to the series.
[time=740] And again I hope you stay with us as Pastor Russ develops the book of Philippians and it might be a great suggestion to read through the book of Philippians.
[time=752] It's a short book and you could have some sense of what's coming next as he preaches from Sunday to Sunday and I hope you'll stay with us and join us for each one of these messages.
[time=764] Now I want to tell you that as a member of the Founders Club you'll be receiving a letter in the next couple of days talking about living Christmas tree tickets.
[time=772] Sometimes I see advertisements and I see decorations rust in the stores early on last night I was at a store and they were decorating Christmas trees.
[time=784] And I can remember the time when I kind of bristled at that and said it's just way too early and it is a little early but because of the logistics of getting ticket requests out and then getting the tickets back to you.
[time=796] We have to write to you the first of October give you some time to select the tickets that you'd like to receive.
[time=802] And as a member of the Founders Club you'll receive this letter and you can request tickets and get that request back to us as soon as you can and then we'll send you the tickets that you request it.
[time=812] So watch for that letter and send it back just as soon as you possibly can.
[time=817] And then we have the book this month called The Quest for Character. Several of you have written in and sent a donation and we've sent you this book.
[time=825] Russell just one little quote in here that just really hit me this week.
[time=828] Character is simply long habit continued. It's just the process and you know it just doesn't come easy but if you'd like to receive a copy of this book and work on that letting God be free.
[time=841] A letting God chisel away hammer away at your life and develop your character for him.
[time=847] You can write for this book today at the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=858] I'll stay tuned for some more music now and then the message from the book of Philippians from our pastor Russell Moore.
[time=871] [MUSIC]
[time=883] Like peering through window blurred with rain emotions run together in a flood of doubt and hate.
[time=900] We've prayed as best we can.
[time=907] Now we must leave it in his hands. Yet I know when my eyes fail to see he is able.
[time=929] And even though it seems impossible to me.
[time=937] But if he chooses not to move in the way we prayed it would.
[time=954] Confident he is working all together for our good. I will stand behind his word for his love.
[time=977] [MUSIC]
[time=989] Question seemed to hold us night and day. How could God allow my heart be torn this way?
[time=1007] Does he listen when I call? Is he even then at all? Yet I know when my eyes fail to see he is able.
[time=1034] And even though it seems impossible to me. He is able.
[time=1051] For if he chooses not to move in the way we prayed it would. Confident he is working all together for your good.
[time=1066] I will stand behind his word for his love.
[time=1089] And as the night gives away the dawning and evaporates away, I stand to face another day.
[time=1105] And I will stand behind his word for his love.
[time=1131] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1139] Thank you so much. I couldn't think of a better song. If you have your Bible I will invite you to turn it to the book of Philippians.
[time=1157] And I am excited about it and I am hopeful that it will be a great, great time over the next few weeks and months as we open our hearts and minds to the letter of Paul to the Philippians.
[time=1172] And chapter 1, let me invite you to follow along as I read verses 9 through 11.
[time=1184] And this I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment.
[time=1193] So that you may approve the things that are excellent in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ, having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God.
[time=1213] You can look up from your Bible now. How does it look?
[time=1220] For those of you who are new today I don't need glasses and I don't ever wear glasses.
[time=1225] In fact I got these when I was in seminary. We were studying Hebrew that's part of the grind of seminary and it's written in this unusual alphabet that forces you to pay special attention to accents on the top of the letters and the bottom of the letters and I about went blind trying to do that.
[time=1241] And so I had to have these glasses and I'm happy to say I haven't much used them since.
[time=1246] But I wear them today to help make a point and I trust that they will stick in your mind as you go from the place today because I want to talk to you about the power of perspective from God's word.
[time=1261] Last year during basketball season one of my good friends here in Indiana called me up and said hey Russ I got a great opportunity for you.
[time=1268] How would you like to be a phantom fan at the fury game? And I said well just exactly what does that mean? And he said oh it's super.
[time=1276] You go early before the game starts you have an opportunity to go into the locker room and you suit up with the guys.
[time=1282] They go ahead and put a uniform on you and one of those warm-up suits and then you go on out onto the court and you do the warm-ups, you shoot the ball, you do the lay-ups, you do the whole nine yards and then you sit on the bench with the team.
[time=1295] And when you when they call the team over to do some discussion you get to huddle up with the guys same thing and a half time you're in there with the guys you come back.
[time=1303] So it's a super opportunity how do you like to do that? And I said well thank you but really no thank you because I had a completely different perspective on being one of these guys a phantom fan you see the last thing in the world that I want to do is walk into a locker room with a bunch of professional athletes all of whom are five to six to ten inches taller than I am and in proper shape.
[time=1332] And disrobe and get into their uniform and then step out in front of all the people of Fort Wayne in my skinny little white legs you know popping down beneath these basketball shorts and that can hear the conversation in the stands.
[time=1347] They're saying things like hey who's that overweight run over there is he a new guy on the team you know and they're looking through the program and finally somebody helps them out and says no he's a he's a phantom fan.
[time=1361] And then I'm doing my lay ups and I'm thinking this is this you don't understand I would never ever want to do that in all my life but a lot of guys could get really excited about it.
[time=1376] The other day we were back in Santa Barbara and my brother law Al said hey want to take you out to dinner going to have a great time so we go over the hill down into Santa Barbara right there on the coast and we go this really neat expensive restaurant.
[time=1388] It's Cajun food I've never had it before so I don't understand the menu and I just say to my very trustingly to my brother I just go ahead and order up you know we grew up together just whatever you like I like so just order for me.
[time=1399] So he does that and then this food comes and I take a huge portion into my mouth and then my mouth my lips are burning off my face you know I'm resisting the temptation to spit everything out into my deal and drink water I can't believe it and he's over there just chowing down.
[time=1417] Having a great time. How's it go beauty is in the eye of the the holder.
[time=1427] We had an opportunity not too long ago to house it for some dear friends here in Fort Wayne.
[time=1432] We're excited about it we like their kids are kids like our kids we could help them out they've done a lot for us.
[time=1438] The day comes closer my wife says you know they're really concerned about their dog. They like their dog a lot and they want us to take extra care of it and they gave us some special instructions I'm thinking why I like dogs too so that shouldn't be much of a problem.
[time=1452] We get there and this thing comes up to me.
[time=1459] It's there's little itty bitty dog that probably doesn't weigh more than a couple ounces and this long hair and these bows in it's hair and these little eyes you know BDI looking at you.
[time=1473] And we're supposed to take care of this thing they love this thing it got sick they spent money to fix it you understand what I'm saying they care about this dog.
[time=1485] And you understand my definition of a dog I have a I have a Labrador retriever and I brought my dog from people who promised to me my dog would grow to to a weight of over 85 pounds I didn't want any out Labrador I want a big strong massive Labrador.
[time=1502] Well so I'm doing my best you know because of my loyalty to these people have no affection for this thing.
[time=1508] And so the day comes to an end and it's time to go to bed and Heidi says you know they they let their dog sleep with them on the bed.
[time=1519] And I'm thinking not tonight they don't.
[time=1523] No sorry and so I don't I don't lift the dog up onto the bed.
[time=1528] Now that's operative word lift you notice the dog is not even big enough to jump on a normal sized bed.
[time=1533] And I rest my case okay this is not a dog this is an overgirl rat.
[time=1538] All right so I don't even touch it now I I'm gracious I leave the door open so the dog can be in the room I'm thinking that'll be a nice compromise.
[time=1545] Well I'm trying to fall asleep here and all of a sudden this dog or whatever comes over and puts his paws up as high as he can reach on the bed right by my face and starts to do this.
[time=1555] Start to growl at me because I won't let it up on the bed.
[time=1562] So for fear that it would blow its circuits and die I put it over there next to Heidi.
[time=1570] Now you see perspective makes a world of rivers doesn't it?
[time=1574] Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
[time=1578] Why? Because you and I have certain values through our experiences in life as we're growing up through our educational process.
[time=1587] We combine all that stuff with our depraved natures and we come up with what we call values things inside of us principles whereby we can make value judgments.
[time=1595] We can look at one kind of a dog and the same person looks at the same kind of a dog and they say wonderful dog.
[time=1601] We'll buy the dog we'll cherish the dog we'll love the dog we'll sleep with the dog.
[time=1604] Other people say you know all was not good on the sixth day when God rested.
[time=1611] You know some of us are thinking it's a divine problem.
[time=1615] Value judgments.
[time=1618] Paul is concerned to write to us today about our value judgments.
[time=1622] He wants to talk to us about some of the fundamental things that make us what we are.
[time=1628] We can evaluate animals or feery, phantom fan or a kind of food.
[time=1633] Now those are part of us but he really wants to talk about what makes us people and individuals and allows us to view our world in certain ways whereby we are either filled with joy and purpose and happiness and excitement and optimism for the future.
[time=1649] Those kinds of values or the kinds of values that lead us to a place of despair and depression and hopelessness and we are beside ourselves trying to make it through the day with no good anticipation for tomorrow.
[time=1663] The book of Philippians is all about joy. It's the letter of joy.
[time=1668] Sixteen times in four chapters the word joy is used in this epistle and whenever you come to study a book of the Bible you must first step back and say what is the book about?
[time=1679] What is the theme? What is the general tenor of the book all about? You come to the book of Matthew. You know it's about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Messiah.
[time=1687] Well we study the book of Revelation and we know for a fact that the book of Revelation has a theme that's called how the world is going to end and every chapter begins to tell us more about the events that lead up to the end of the age.
[time=1701] And so we can understand the book better, the individual parts of the book, the paragraphs, the sentences, the truths, the phrases because we know they fit in a context, the end of the world.
[time=1711] And this book is about your emotions and the one that God selects to talk about and to hold up as the point of the rallying point and the point of growth, the point to which we move is the deep, sincere, genuine joy of the Christian experience.
[time=1731] And in this book he is going to talk to us about his own personal experiences to illustrate some truths. He's going to talk to us about the life of Christ to illustrate some truths and then at some points he's going to turn the spotlight on the Philippians and therefore on us.
[time=1750] In other words, I'm trying to say that just because this is a book about joy, don't misunderstand me to say we're going to skip across the mountain tops of life and never touch the valleys because part of this thing called Christian joy involves the valleys and it involves a deep penetrating look inside our own souls and at our value systems and what we think we are and where we got those and what we can do with those.
[time=1774] So it won't be a superficial study, it'll be a penetrating study by God's grace. And I invite you to come along, I invite you to really anticipate the next many months together thinking about our emotions and how they interact with our minds and the truth and our relationship with Christ and people and what is this path towards the joy of Christianity.
[time=1796] You say I'm not so sure I want to learn it from you or I'm not so sure I want to learn it from Paul, who is this guy?
[time=1805] I want to say to you that Paul has good credentials to teach us about joy because of a number of things, number one he's old when he writes this letter, he has lived a lot of life, he has seen a lot of experiences, he has gone through a lot of mountain tops and a lot of valleys.
[time=1819] And so he doesn't write to you out of youthful optimism and the ignorance that accompanies youth for lack of time, he's really been through it.
[time=1828] I want to say also to you that Paul at this very moment is in prison and he says that there in Philippians 1-12 now I want you to know brethren that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole Praetorian Church.
[time=1848] The whole Praetorian Guard and to everybody else, the Praetorian Guard typically was stationed in Rome and so we believe that he was imprisoned in Rome under house arrest and yet look at this letter and it's theme of joy.
[time=1861] Chapter 1 verses 3 and 4 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you always offering prayer with joy in my every prayer for you all.
[time=1871] He's imprisoned, he's seasoned, he's lived through life, he's waiting either to be released or to be executed but he's speaking about a real thing going on inside of him, it's joy.
[time=1884] Come with me to chapter 2 for a minute and look at verses 17 and 18. He says there but even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[time=1900] As you too, I urge you rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me. He's got an honest appraisal of his life, he's viewing himself as a cup of water and in his ministry through the years to promote the gospel and to plant this church in Philippi and learn more about that in the weeks to come.
[time=1918] He views himself as being poured out, the content of his soul, his personhood is compared to the contents of a glass of water as a drink offering or a sacrificial offering being poured out.
[time=1929] This is draining me of all that I am. But I rejoice and I share my joy with you all and you too, I urge you rejoice in the same way. Come to chapter 3 and look at verse 17.
[time=1943] He even invites you to take him as a role model. He says there in verse 17, brethren, join in following my example and observe those who walk according to the pattern that you have in us.
[time=1956] He's begging them, look at my life, you've known me for some 10 years and you've seen the experiences of my life and I'm asking you to please pattern your life after me as I pattern my life after Christ.
[time=1969] As a result, he's going to give us some really inside looks to his heart and to his soul, to his personality, to his thinking processes.
[time=1977] So we can indeed pattern our lives. And then of course, chapter 4, verse 4, the verse that many of us have memorized since we were little kids. If we grew up in the church, rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice.
[time=1993] So the theme clearly is joy. Chuckswindow calls it the book that makes you smile. John MacArthur calls it the epistle of joy. It's commonly recognized by scholars of old and of contemporary that this is the book that teaches us about joy in the Christian experience.
[time=2012] So we'll learn lessons from it. The one we're going to learn today back in chapter 1 is the power of perspective.
[time=2019] The power of perspective and being joyful as a Christian. I want to give you a brief explanation of these three verses that I think really center on where he's driving in this first paragraph, verses 1 to 11.
[time=2034] He opens chapter 1 verse 1 with himself as the author, Timothy, a common bond servant with Christ. Maybe Timothy was described who wrote it down.
[time=2042] He's writing to the saints who are in the little city, Philippi, as I say, will have fun learning about those people. Maybe next Sunday, maybe in the future. He notes, including the overseers and the deacons.
[time=2053] It gives his common greeting grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Talks about his joy for them. He talks about his confidence in verse 6 and the great God that has begun to work and he'll finish the work.
[time=2066] Then he moves in verses 7 and 8 to the intimacy of their relationship together. Look at verse 8 for God is my witness how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
[time=2076] These people are really impassioned with each other. They have found things about each other that draw them into close Christian fellowship and love.
[time=2083] But then he comes to the kind of the punch of this first paragraph. That's what I want to try to explain briefly and then illustrate and apply.
[time=2091] Verse 9, he says, "And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment."
[time=2102] The word love there is not the word for eroticism. The kind of love that is sexually driven. It is not the kind of love that is driven by family relationships and your baby's born and you look at it and you say, "I love it. I don't know why. I just love it."
[time=2118] Not that kind of love. This is the love of choice. This is the love of decision. Agape in the Greek means, "I am making a conscious self-aware choice of what I am going to love and what I am going to exclude from my love."
[time=2135] He is saying that the power of perspective begins at the point of where you choose to set your affections, what you choose to love and what you choose not to love.
[time=2148] You understand that all love is not good. All love is not good. Speaking with a lady not too long ago and she said, "I fall in love with a man and he is not my husband but I am not too worried about it because I know that love is from God. In fact, God is love and this is real love so this must be right."
[time=2168] You see, love is not blind. What he is saying is, look at verse 9, "Love or choose to love things, abounding, let it be like cascading waterfalls. Your love just increases and increases."
[time=2181] But it is not a blind love. It is an informed love. See it there in verse 9, "In real knowledge and all discernment. What he is crying out for you and I to do. You and me to do on the path of joy."
[time=2195] Is to begin this process by very carefully guarding where we set our affections, to be setting our love based upon the knowledge, real knowledge. Where do we get that?
[time=2207] From the word of God through biblical principles, they guide and they shape and they force and they contour and they shore up where we set our love, where we put our affections.
[time=2219] And we do that. We use that knowledge. We get from the word of God at the end of verse 9 with real discernment. You see, we look carefully at things.
[time=2227] We are not indiscriminate. We say, "Is that worthy of my love? Will I choose to put my love and my affections on that thing or on that person or on that perspective or on that viewpoint? Is that going to become a part of me?"
[time=2242] Well, let me check first. What does the word of God say about that? And now, God, give me wisdom to discern whether, in fact, this particular situation should capture my heart.
[time=2254] That's step 1. Now, what he's laying out for us here is a sequence of three steps.
[time=2259] The second step is found in verse 10 and it begins with this little phrase, "so that." And the Greek language gives real power to its author by granting him a phrase like "so that."
[time=2270] It's a sequential step. Do this so that this will occur. That's what he's saying. What does this occurs? Verse 10, "so that you may approve the things that are excellent."
[time=2282] Now, this word "approved" was originally used of testing metals. Someone would give you gold. Is it fools gold? Is it real gold? The process of approval would deter the purity and the properties of that metal.
[time=2294] It was also used of actual coinage and money to determine whether or not it was genuine and authentic and therefore valuable or whether it was counterfeit.
[time=2303] And if you receive counterfeit money, you've been taken. You have something of no value. It was also used to describe the process of evaluating livestock.
[time=2312] And you know if somebody brings a horse, they tell you it's a great horse about three or four or five years old. You ought to buy this horse for so much money. And you don't know anything about horses, but other people do.
[time=2321] And they know how the sway of the back indicates age. And they know how the teeth and they bend out as the age of the horse grows until they open their mouth and they look at their teeth, they have ways to look past the facade and to approve something.
[time=2335] Yes, it's authentic, it's real, it's genuine of your money. What he's wanting us to develop is the capacity to approve things in our lives.
[time=2348] It goes on to say those things which are excellent. Do you see it there in the middle of verse 10?
[time=2353] The word excellence is just another way of saying the same thing, literally it means to be able to differ, to be able to make distinctions, to be able to decipher and say this is good and this is not good. This is valuable, this is invaluable.
[time=2367] This is a worthy cause, this is an unworthy cause. So the process is very simple. He's saying I'm praying that your capacity to attach yourselves to things will grow and grow and grow.
[time=2380] I want you to be a passionate people that really open your heart and love things deeply. But I'm praying that you're going to use your capacity to love and accordance with real knowledge and discernment.
[time=2395] Only set that huge capacity to love on things that are of value. What will happen next is intrinsically, not a mind game, this is a power of positive thinking, this is a genuine consequence of that kind of affection.
[time=2409] When options are brought before you, you will honestly appraise them as valuable or invaluable. You'll say it's worth something to me or it's not worth something to me.
[time=2421] The third step is found also in verse 10, so that you may approve the things that are excellent in order that, another sequential step, in order that you would be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ.
[time=2434] The word sincere was used in the old days of a potter and he grabbed the clay and he put it on the wheel and he'd spin it and he'd work with it and invest his time and make the shape that he liked, then he'd pop it off that spinning wheel and he'd put it in the fire.
[time=2447] And oftentimes whether the clay wasn't right or the fire was too hot or he left it in there too long, a crack. Sometimes it would just disintegrate, but other times it would just be a slight crack in the pottery itself.
[time=2459] Well, the potter, depending upon his integrity, would make a choice. Some men who were not sincere, who were not men of integrity, would say I got too much time and money invested in what I've already got.
[time=2471] So I'm going to take some wax and I'm going to fill the crack in and then I'm going to put some type of a sealant and a coat on the outside and the naïve person in the marketplace will not know.
[time=2481] They'll take that pot home, they'll use it in their fireplace and then it'll shatter, but I'll have my money.
[time=2487] And so this notion of being sincere is the notion of being lifted up to the light because the scrutinizing woman or man in the marketplace would never buy a pot short of holding it up to the sun and turning it very carefully because oftentimes what they used to paint or cover was not sufficient enough to keep the penetrating light of the sun from revealing the crack.
[time=2507] What he's saying is I want you to become that kind of a person. You set your affections on things which are consistent with the word of God. It's really where you're at in your heart.
[time=2520] As a result when opportunities are presented to you or circumstances in your life come before you you can make real discerning approval decisions about what they are that come from deep within you and that leads you to be a person of genuine sincerity integrity and character and my friends that is the beginning of true joy.
[time=2543] You can't buy that. You can't purchase it. You can't even sell it. Now I said I tried to illustrate. Let me take a shot at it.
[time=2555] I can remember as clearly as yesterday sitting outside my father's office in Santa Barbara. He sold orthopedics. My mother and I were waiting for him as we often did to get off the phone.
[time=2566] We were sitting there and one of my dad's friends pulled up in a brand new, whatever year that was, Porsche, Carrera with the fin on the back and the big wide tires and the souped up engine back then maybe it was 30,000 I think they run about 70,000 dollars today.
[time=2582] He pulls up next to us and my mom says to me that's so and so. Do you know that he's only 36 years old and when he was 28 he had this brilliant idea and he explained that to me.
[time=2595] And she said look at how here comes successful he is. Well that got reinforced to me many, many, many different times as I would travel with my parents and they would continue to hold that up as a picture of success.
[time=2611] And then I would turn the television on it would be reinforced again and then I would open the magazines and I'd see it all over again and suddenly I was in the habit of setting my affections and approving certain things that were based purely on professional success and the monetary joys that came with it and the toys you could buy at the end of that process.
[time=2633] And you know what for years I never even knew I had glasses on. It never dawned on me that the reason I would come to that conclusion about that person was because I had a set of lenses on through which I viewed them.
[time=2647] What Paul is saying. If you want to know the path of joy you got to learn to look not just through your lenses, you got to learn to look at your lenses.
[time=2658] Where did I get that. Is that what I believe. Is that really me. Did somebody give this to me life experiences and education and my own depraved nature and all of a sudden I got myself a very powerful set of lenses that caused me to walk around and only value people who are successful wealthy and have a lot of toys.
[time=2679] Now frankly folks it sickens me to say it because by the grace of God at some point in my life I was able to look at the paradigm if you will. I was able to look at the values that I was wearing around.
[time=2690] See God has given us the capacity of self awareness. In other words we have the ability not just to look at light through lenses but also the ability to look at the lens itself.
[time=2701] That's one of God's gifts to us to be created in the image of God. And what he is saying here is I want you to look at the lens and the things you set your affections on the deep values that determine your joy or not your joy.
[time=2713] Are they consistent with real knowledge. Does the Bible support that a man is a success because he's professionally competent. Got lots of money in the toys that go with it my friends.
[time=2722] How superficial. How empty. How vain. Man I'm glad I can see my lenses because I took them off and I put some different ones on. And now I'm working really hard and I'm excited as I grow day by day.
[time=2737] And now the things when I look at people I start asking different questions. I ask about their character I want to know how do they treat their wife. How do they treat their husband.
[time=2747] Are they honest in their employment. I don't really care how much they make anymore. I just want to know do they do a good job. Do they serve the Lord and their master with all their heart.
[time=2756] I want to know how they treat their kids. I want to know what they do with their money. Are they faithfully sacrificial giving to the cause of Christ. I got new lenses now. I can see differently and guess what I got new lenses to look at me.
[time=2770] Now I can look at my life with the same lenses and I can say you know what I don't make a million dollars a year. And I don't have all the toys and the freedom and the stuff that goes with that.
[time=2782] I have a lot of stuff I'm thankful for but I don't have that kind of stuff. And you know what it's okay because I got the right lenses on.
[time=2791] I could begin to know and experience the joy of God because I'm setting my affections and I'm giving real approval and I'm learning to be sincere in my own heart.
[time=2802] See that's not self-talk there folks. That's not positive. I don't have to psych myself up in the morning to think I'm okay because I'm not a millionaire.
[time=2808] I genuinely believe that. That's who I am now. You're saying well thanks for getting there pal. I know but that's where I come from.
[time=2816] See the process. It's exciting. Not too long ago somebody said to me hey you want to move to Indiana.
[time=2823] I said where? It's great church. Good people. Indiana. Yeah I tried. I said I've been there a couple of times. I don't ever want to go there again.
[time=2834] Oh man I had some, they called me the California kid. These were my California kid sunglasses. These were the sunglasses I wore when I would ride my motorcycle or I would go to the beach and play beach volleyball.
[time=2845] I would go up into the mountains just a few miles away from that and go skiing. I would walk out of class that I would teach in the Santa Creed of Valley where I would live and I would take in these deep inhaling breasts of the warm marvelous wonderful environment of Southern California.
[time=2861] We weren't the smuggy part obviously. And I would say to myself I am never, never going to leave California. Good night. Take a look at that. Oh those are good values.
[time=2873] Yeah. That's what you want to live your life on. Right? To my own shame I admit to you that when the decision to come here was almost final.
[time=2882] I hung up the phone with my mom and dad and Heidi and I were sitting on the bed there in our bedroom and I started a week. I allowed. I started a week for a long time.
[time=2895] Heidi just hanging on to me and finally I could talk and I said I just can't leave. She's what do you mean? I said well I'm just laying here crying and I'm just seeing the ocean and I'm seeing the mountains and I'm seeing the rolling inland hills of the coastal valley I grew up and the oak trees and I don't know if I can do it.
[time=2923] You know what people ask me now they say hey. What do you like about the weather here in Indiana? I say the people. Yeah. I like the people in Indiana. I got new lenses on see. Now let me be honest with you. I get here to Indiana. You are a very nice people and this is a very great church but I'm sitting over there in my little office with the door shut in the shade down and I peek out there and I go oh it's raining again and I shut them and I start to cry all over again. No joke. Why?
[time=2952] Because I haven't seen the sun in 25 days. You see I'm here and I'm obeying God and I believe this is where he wants me but there's no joy in my life at that point because I had the wrong lenses on it. It's a process to get those off and look at them and reject them and get the new ones on.
[time=2971] Now I can honestly tell you that the weather around here is becoming my friend. That's right. It's becoming my friend. Why? Why is it becoming my friend? Because as I feel in the last few days the weather is starting to change and it's starting to get cold.
[time=2991] I say to myself see you're going to be a reminder all winter long that God can change my heart. It's my friend. It's going to call me to that all year long because I got new values now. See you know what matters to me about Indiana? You do. This church does. The things we stand for, the principles of God's Word, what we're trying to accomplish. I feel free now. See the Bible says that you shall know the truth and what?
[time=3020] Truth's I'll set you free. Russell don't set your love and affection on weather, on a certain environment, on rolling hills and oak trees and oceans and mountains. Set your affection on things which are consistent to real knowledge and use some discernment. Well you can. Let me tell you what matters in life. Not the weather. It's the people and it's the things that those people are committed to trying to do.
[time=3046] So now from my heart I can honestly begin to approve. Test the metal for its quality and say Indiana is the place for me. I want to be right here because this is where God is using me. This is where God has brought me. These are God's people and those values are genuine.
[time=3065] When I was in seminary I read about Abram and how he left. You see he left the land of earth to follow God to the promised land and he left his family. He left his religion. He left his way of life. He left his culture and he went out and I said to myself many times as I read about that story.
[time=3080] Man I wish I could be in Abraham. I would do that. I love God. I would do that. Well then he let me do it. And you see there's a process whereby in order to know the joy of following God like.
[time=3094] You've got to get some lenses off and you've got to get some new ones on. I don't know what it is in your life. I don't know what it is in your life. I wish I knew what it was in your life.
[time=3106] That robs your joy. That steals from you. The exhilaration of being in the will of God and setting your affections on the things that are really real knowledge.
[time=3120] But I got a way that you can help yourself. There it is the tip of the day. When you feel yourself being incredibly sad or depressed or downtrodden.
[time=3134] Do not just look at the circumstances or the people in your life that are making you feel that way or contributing to that feeling.
[time=3141] Take off your lenses and look at them. Do you understand what I'm saying? Maybe it means you need to review some of the events in your youth and your childhood where we get these things.
[time=3157] Maybe you need to view some of the things that you have been taught about life and about people.
[time=3163] But it says you begin to look at that and sometimes you're going to be sad and you're going to be hurting and your lens is going to be consistent with the word of God and you're going to be genuinely sorrowful and longing even as Paul is in this passage to see some people that you can't see.
[time=3177] And those times you say, "Oh, it hurts but it's okay because I know it's consistent." This is all part. But sometimes you're going to be hurting and you're going to be angry and you're going to be depressed and you're going to be removed and shut down emotionally and you're going to be distant and you're going to be shut down and you take the lens off and you say, "Look, where did this thing come from? This is not who I want to be."
[time=3199] Then you can get on your knees and you can pray, "God, please change it. Please change it. Bring people into my life to change my value system, to change my lenses so that beauty will be in the eye of the beholder and what I'll be valuing and beautiful will be the right stuff."
[time=3219] You say, "Hey, it's 12 o'clock. I know." Come to chapter three for just a second. Look at this. I wish I could go on but I'm going to stop right here now.
[time=3229] Philippians chapter three, you want to see evidence of this in the word of God? Paul, he lists off here in chapter three all of his big credentials.
[time=3238] Let me put my dark glasses on. This is the dark glasses, Paul. Verse four, "Although I myself might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, it's me."
[time=3247] Then he listed off, circumcised the eighth day nation of Israel, tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew of Hebrew's law, a Pharisee, zeal, persecuted church, righteousness, which is on found blameless.
[time=3256] "Man, I am self-righteous. I earn my way to salvation. And those credentials mean more to me than anything else in the world."
[time=3265] That was his value system. But look what happens. Verse seven, "But whatever things were gained to me, all that stuff, those things I have counted as lost.
[time=3275] I took my lenses off and I looked at them and I said, 'Not anymore. I repent. I don't want to think that way and I don't want to be that way, those are not my values anymore.'"
[time=3285] Verse seven, "But whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as lost for the sake of Christ." Now watch here it comes.
[time=3290] More than that, what are the new lenses? I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing, what's the word?
[time=3298] The surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish in order that I make gain Christ.
[time=3311] There's a biblical example of what I'm trying to illustrate out of my own life and from the truth of God's word today.
[time=3317] Take your lenses off, look at them. Are they consistent with the principles of the Word of God?
[time=3323] If they are rejoiced and strengthened them, if they aren't, take them off and begin slowly and by the grace of God to get a new value system.
[time=3334] What will happen is you'll start approving things that are really valuable. You'll start viewing the circumstances of your life through a different set of lenses and you'll see things in those same circumstances that are really of value to the cause of Christ.
[time=3347] You'll be full of integrity and you'll begin to know more and more the joy of the Word. Let's pray together.
[time=3358] Father, I'm so thankful for the chance to be here with these people at this time to study your Word together and to contemplate our emotions and who we are and what we are and what we value and what we esteem.
[time=3375] Help us, Lord, to use the capacity of self-awareness to get the lenses off and look and examine them and buy your grace through surgery on us and give us new ones.
[time=3388] Make us whole and complete and sincere and blameless and fill our hearts with the Christian joy that can only be found in Christ.
[time=3398] Jesus name. Amen.
