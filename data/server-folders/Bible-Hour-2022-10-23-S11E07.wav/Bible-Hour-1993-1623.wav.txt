[time=0] it all comes down to what you want, it all comes down to what you're going to value.
[time=25] It all comes down to where you're going to place the emphasis and the importance in your life.
[time=31] If we value, becoming like Christ, if we value what God values in us, then through
[time=40] all of those hard circumstances there can be a great sense of joy.
[time=56] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=62] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=64] Thank you for joining us.
[time=67] Does happiness always seem to be just around the corner for you?
[time=71] If only I had a better job.
[time=73] If only my husband were more positive.
[time=76] If only I had more time to myself.
[time=80] The Bible teaches us that true joy comes from a relationship with Christ, not our circumstances.
[time=87] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore explains to us the secret of uncircumstantial joy in
[time=93] Christ.
[time=95] Our special music today will be provided by Michelle Sminkins and Brian Losen.
[time=107] Let's join our sanctuary choir and orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=128] For the things we are seeing you do as we gather, we worship you, and in full will we
[time=149] sing for your pleasure, Lord.
[time=152] For your pleasure, Lord, it's all to us we sing, we're all worthy to be all our King.
[time=165] Hear before your praise, hallelujah, as we raise, take our sacrifice of grace for your pleasure, Lord.
[time=182] For the life may we ever be, we be taught for you, by reserve and be.
[time=194] Hell was brought to maturity, to marry the source of your pleasure, Lord.
[time=204] For your pleasure, Lord, we answer to as we sing,
[time=211] we're all worthy to be all our King.
[time=217] Hear before your praise, hallelujah, as we raise, take our sacrifice of grace for your pleasure, Lord.
[time=232] For your pleasure, Lord, we answer to as we sing, we're all worthy to be all our King.
[time=245] Hear before your praise, hallelujah, as we raise, take our sacrifice of grace for your pleasure,
[time=258] take our sacrifice of grace for your pleasure, Lord.
[time=294] Born of almighty God, Sam from His Heavenly Throne,
[time=318] given to reign over kings and priests, the sins are meant to attend.
[time=331] The Messiah will return, the hour alone to mend.
[time=344] A banner of grace shall never be heard, as creation rejoices in Him.
[time=360] The emergency He will come, with the sound of the trumpet, to claim the reading, the emergency He will come.
[time=380] Jesus, the Savior, teach her not King every knee in heaven and earth with us.
[time=392] The bells for evil, he manages to hear, he will come.
[time=419] Close in his regal home, crowned in his sovereignty.
[time=431] The Savior of righteousness in his hand, O Lord, for eternity.
[time=444] His kingdom will have no end, for those who have no God's grace.
[time=457] The saints of all ages will gather as long, the joyful in all God in his face.
[time=473] He will come, with the sound of the trumpet, to claim the reading, the emergency He will come.
[time=493] Jesus, the Savior, teach her not King every knee in heaven and earth with us.
[time=506] He will come, with the sound of the trumpet, to claim the reading, the emergency He will come.
[time=585] Jesus, the Savior, teach her not King every knee in heaven and earth with us.
[time=621] He will come, with the sound of the trumpet, to claim the reading, the emergency He will come.
[time=651] I can't tell you how pleased we are that you've tuned in for the Bible hour again today.
[time=656] I want to remind founders, club members, that in just a few days you'll be receiving the letter.
[time=661] I'll tell you some information about how you can receive tickets for our living Christmas tree.
[time=666] It's a little bit early, but to accommodate everyone, we have to start early.
[time=671] And so when you get your reservation, be sure that you mark the days that you'd like to come to the living Christmas tree and get it back to our office as soon as possible so that we can be sure and give you free tickets for the days that you want to come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=685] I hope we'll see many of you here.
[time=688] Russell, we're really thrilled that we get a lot of letters that come to us each week and we are thankful that there are some great spiritual needs that people share with us and we have that opportunity then to pray about.
[time=700] Well that's right and I'm excited that we do that as a ministry.
[time=703] I remember when some of the teleavangeless ministries were being exposed, I can still see images in my mind of huge bags of mail received and only rifled through to see if there was money in it and then thrown away.
[time=719] And that's never happened here. I'm thankful that in each situation the letters are read and when prayer is requested, our staff sits down and prays for those on a weekly basis.
[time=731] And I guess that gives us a sense of being true to our word that we're not just saying we want to help people in their spiritual needs, but we're doing our part that we can, you know, to be praying for them.
[time=741] I'm really thankful that we can pray for mothers that right in, one mother wrote in this week and asked for prayer for salvation for her 15 year old son and her 17 year old son and boy they need salvation.
[time=754] Another one has a broken marriage that she's hoping will be mended in that we should pray about and just those are real, very real cases right in our community that we have the privilege of praying for.
[time=766] So we're really thankful we have that opportunity.
[time=769] Russell, we're in the series in Philippians and I know I want to encourage the people to stay faithful every week because this is a great study in that book.
[time=777] Well, it really is and I'm amazed at how practical the book is as I'm trying to apply it to my own life and as I hear from people in our church, but the argument of the book, the thought continues to develop and it has significance to our emotions and how to relate to life.
[time=795] The joy and sadness and sorrow and happiness and where all that fits and it's not that the Christian life is a bed of roses by any means, but the book of Philippians gives us perspective to approach a very difficult life and find the joy of God in the midst of that.
[time=812] There's any relevance to the scriptures, boy, Philippians is certainly one of those for all of our families. So I hope that you'll stay tuned each week for the Bible Hour.
[time=821] Just before we go back to the regular program portion of the Bible Hour, I want to remind you that we're offering the book this month, The Quest for Character by Charles Swindall.
[time=831] If you've read anything by Chuck Swindall, you know that it's excellent reading. Usually it's not very difficult, but it's very encouraging.
[time=838] And this is similar to the study of Philippians where Chuck just goes through and chisels away at our lives and sands away and tells how God can refine us if we have that desire.
[time=851] We really need to take the time and the discipline to read the Word of God and to be encouraged by it and then heed what it has to say.
[time=859] This is how to book and then as you read the book of Philippians along with this book, I think you can be encouraging your spiritual life and your character will grow more Christ like each day.
[time=871] So we'd like to offer this book to you. You can write to the Bible Hour today at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=881] Once again, just ask by the book, The Quest for Character, right to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=893] We'll send you the book absolutely free. If you can send us a donation, we'd really appreciate that.
[time=899] Now we go back to some more music and then the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=911] [MUSIC]
[time=930] A great day is coming. Heaven's gates will open wide and all who love the Lord will enter in.
[time=946] And join with their loved ones who in Jesus Christ have died. Their eternal life in heaven will begin.
[time=964] And the Lord Himself will greet us, or a joy will fill that day. When with a smile of the proudest Father, He looks at us to save.
[time=984] Welcome home children. This is the place I've prepared for you. Welcome home children. Now that your work on earth is through.
[time=1012] Welcome home children. We will have followed so late Holy. Welcome home children.
[time=1032] Welcome home children. You where I am. You will always be forever rejoicing with me.
[time=1060] Welcome home children. This is the place I've prepared for you.
[time=1088] Welcome home children. Welcome home children. You where I am. You will always be forever rejoicing.
[time=1110] Forever rejoicing. Forever rejoicing with me.
[time=1128] Welcome home.
[time=1142] Amen. Thank you Brian. And both the specials this morning have just focused so clearly on heaven and going to heaven and the presence of our Lord.
[time=1160] It's an encouraging theme. Let me invite you this morning to take your bibles with me and come to Philippians chapter 1.
[time=1166] If you were with us last week, you know that we began a study of this wonderful book, The Pistil of Joy. The letter that makes you smile. It's the book about Christians and their emotions and the pinnacle of those emotions, namely the emotion of joy.
[time=1186] The great joys of my life in the last several years has been the privilege to have led two guys to Christ since I've been here in Indiana.
[time=1198] Different times and under different circumstances. But the Lord laid it on my heart in both cases to challenge those guys to meet with me on a regular basis so that I could disciple them, so that I could challenge them in the things of the Lord and to help set the foundation and the framework and the value of God.
[time=1215] And the values and the worldview that would mark the rest of their life. And I'm happy that they agreed to do that. We spent most of last year doing that on Wednesday afternoons with me to my office and talk and pray and study the word of God together and just a tremendous time.
[time=1229] We took the summer off because I felt I needed to slow my schedule down a little bit and reduce it down to just some of the basic rudiment things of my ministry here.
[time=1238] And now that fall is here, we're beginning back up. And last Wednesday was our first chance together. Ask the guys to just share them with me what had happened to them and what God had been teaching them in the time that they had that summer.
[time=1252] The first guy spoke and said, "Well, it's been kind of a tough summer." And I was aware that when we were meeting together towards the end of last year, he was excited about a new job that had opened up and had gone through a long process of interviewing and finally received the job and made the transition.
[time=1271] So I was anxious to hear how that had gone. He was sorry to inform me that though his performance had been fine, the company didn't go as well as had been expected. And so he was let go, maybe a month or two after he had begun, spent the next three weeks wondering how he was going to meet his financial obligations and really kind of hit an emotional low point.
[time=1293] Finally, the person from where he had worked before called him up and said, "We'd heard you were out of work and wanted to know if you wanted to come back." Not knowing what to do and having no other options. He agreed to do that, but it was a very strained and difficult situation.
[time=1307] He had been a manager there and came back as someone who worked for the managers and of course had less pay. And that was very humbling and very humiliating and very difficult to walk back into that place.
[time=1318] And what made it even worse is that vendors he would deal, have dealt with in the past, would come back into his place of employment and they would notice the difference and ask questions.
[time=1328] And so periodically the bar would go back in and it would be very painful and very discouraging. And he confessed to a level of confusion about God and what he was doing and how he worked.
[time=1339] And there was even some anger in his heart that he confessed to and a sense of inability to trust God with his life.
[time=1353] The next guy spoke and said that my summer was very difficult as well and we had known that as our time was running down as we headed toward summer he had been involved in a nice relationship with a gal and he hadn't gone head over heels over her but there was a real interest there.
[time=1369] He reported that she had kind of just put a wet blanket on the thing and ended it and didn't even have the respect for him to kind of explain why and to really open up about what the problem was.
[time=1379] And so he too expressed real confusion and anger and he particularly said I just don't know if I trust God. Well I was happy for them to share these things with me.
[time=1392] Was this if they were saying you know what is this Christianity stuff? I mean if God can't do any better than this, why bother? Why did I get saved? What's this all about?
[time=1406] Well I posed a question to them I said well tell me what is it that God has promised to do in your life between now and heaven.
[time=1418] I mean what does he agree to do and neither of them were anxious to answer because of their confusion and because of their anger and because of the lack of trust that they were experiencing that moment.
[time=1431] I said well let me help you out. God has not promised to give you a job. It's not in the Bible.
[time=1440] God has not promised further to give you a job that leads to another job that is more advanced and makes more money and gives you a better sense of feeling about your station in life.
[time=1452] I said you might also be interested to know that God has nowhere promised to make all of your relationships work out in meaningful and significant ways and for people to treat you the way you wanted to be treated.
[time=1465] Further where God has not promised to give you health. I said the closest I could think of is a commitment. It's a command to us in the Bible that says with food and clothing be content but that's not a promise even to give us food and clothing. You understand that.
[time=1482] God will keep you fed and keep you clothed and housed and protected from the elements as long as he wants you to live and oftentimes the way he will take people home is through starvation and exposure to the elements.
[time=1494] So God hasn't even promised us that. I said but God has made one promise to you for the here and the now.
[time=1504] God has promised to conform you to the image of his son. God has promised to be molding and shaping and directing and changing your heart and your mind and your thoughts and your view of the world.
[time=1523] So that it will be consistent with all of those things as they were represented to us in the person of Christ. I of course was thinking and you don't need to turn there.
[time=1533] But I of course was thinking of Romans 8 where it says we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God for those who are called according to his purpose.
[time=1543] So what is his purpose? It says here for whom he for new he also predestined to become conformed to the image of his son. That's his purpose. That's his promise.
[time=1555] He guarantees to work all things together for good. What good? The good that he defines in making us more light Christ than saying about our job and saying about our money, our relationships, our health, our food or our clothing.
[time=1570] In Galatians chapter 4, Paul says speaking to the Galatians as his children, he says my children with whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you.
[time=1582] That was what he understood his ministry to be as their apostle, as their pastor, as their shepherd, as the guardian of their souls, as the fruit of his labor. Do you want to know what it would culminate in?
[time=1593] What would bring the greatest sense of joy and satisfaction that things are really going well in your life? He would be able to say that that is occurring when you are becoming more like Christ.
[time=1604] That was the criteria through which he evaluated their growth, the criteria through which he evaluated the process of their life.
[time=1612] He says the same thing to the saints at Ephesus, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a mature man. What's that? A guy that has the perfect job and the perfect relationships and the perfect money and all the retina.
[time=1627] A perfect man is one who has made the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=1633] That's talking about the character and the disposition and the outlook and the values.
[time=1639] And then we looked at each other and we thought to ourselves, well, my God has been remarkably faithful. In fact, he's been more faithful than we would have cared for.
[time=1649] He's so committed to keeping his promise to move us into the image of Christ that he's willing to drag these guys through that kind of summer because he knows that's exactly what they need for them to become conformed to the image of Christ.
[time=1666] And then smiles began to break on all of our faces. As we kind of found that we'd been exposed, we'd kind of seen how easy it is to transform our understanding of God and His purposes in our lives to, as they do in Romans 1, recreate God in our own image and make Him into something that is designed to satisfy our needs, our wants, our hopes, our reasonable expectations.
[time=1693] No such promises, no such commitment. He's never defined that way. He is consistently promising to move you and me into the image of Christ.
[time=1702] And in the process, he's going to bring trials. He's going to bring hardship. He's going to bring unpleasant experiences because of his intimate knowledge of who we are and what we are and the way we change and the way we grow.
[time=1720] In the book of Philippians, look at verse 9. He's praying this exact prayer. What he was praying, we were kind of experiencing in my office on Wednesday.
[time=1730] He says, "I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment." What Paul is saying, there is set your affections on things that are informed and consistent with the word of God.
[time=1743] If you set your affections on a God made in your own image, who's supposed to provide circumstantial happiness in your life, you have an ill-advised love. You have set your love on things that are not consistent with the revelation of the word of God. You have been undeserving.
[time=1758] If you have done that, then verse 10, you're going to have a lot of difficulty approving God and what He actually does in your life.
[time=1765] Remember so that you may approve the things that are excellent that first phrase there in verse 10. What he's saying is, if you'll set your love and affection on the right values and on the right stuff as it's presented in the word of God, then when the experiences of your life begin to develop, you'll be able to appraise them and to approve of them in light of the promises of God.
[time=1785] And they'll produce real joy in your life. You'll welcome trials and you'll welcome hardship and you'll welcome difficulty and you'll welcome relational problems as those things which God is uniquely and sovereignly bringing into your life to keep His promise to you to make you more like Christ.
[time=1810] Today as we look at the next 15 verses in this book, verses 12 to 26, you're going to find Paul living this out and giving you examples of this in his own life.
[time=1822] And basically, he's going to say there is one value greater than all the other values. There is one value that if you'll set your love and affection on, then whatever comes into your life, you're going to be able to approve it as excellent and proper and right for its product of producing you to be a sincere and blameless person full of integrity.
[time=1846] I want to ask you a question as we move towards the text. If you are going to list in your mind the three joy-steelers, the three things that steal your joy, what would they be? Just mentally for a moment.
[time=1861] They probably come rather quickly to you. What is it that steals your joy? Well, I venture that you'll find all three of them in this text.
[time=1871] The first is found in verses 12, 13 and 14. Listen to what he says. Now, I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel so that my imprisonment and the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole Praetorian Guard or palace guard, if you have the NIV.
[time=1889] And that most of the brethren, trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment, have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear.
[time=1896] Joy-steeler number one, our adverse circumstances. Paul's happened to be prison. Paul, as he writes this letter, has been imprisoned now for an entire four years.
[time=1908] Paul's imprisonment began in a place called Cessaria, which is northwest of Jerusalem. Paul had come back from his third missionary journey. He was roaming around the city of Jerusalem and the Jews identified him, saw who he was, and said, "Let's get him," because they were adamantly opposed to the gospel.
[time=1925] They created a great riot. You can read about this in Acts 21 through the chapters 28. They caused a great riot. And Paul was about to be lynched and murdered right in the streets, but someone calls for the police. That was the Romans.
[time=1939] The Roman soldiers who were there. And so the Romans took him into custody, not because he'd broken a law, but for his own protection. He was about to be killed in the streets for preaching the gospel.
[time=1949] He was held in prison in Cessaria for two years, where he went through a various trials with Festus and Felix and Herod, and the whole thing was so emotionally charged, and those guys were so spineless, and they were just looking for a political answer, they figured the wisest choice they could make would be to hand him back to the judicial system in Jerusalem, back to the Sanhedrin, back to the Jews, and Paul knew if that occurred, he'd be dead.
[time=1972] And so Paul, being a Roman citizen, exercised one of his rights, one of the long cherished rights of a Roman citizen, and he appealed to have his case heard by none other than Caesar himself.
[time=1984] The Romans respected the appeal they had to, and so he was sent to Rome.
[time=1990] When he arrived in Rome, Acts chapter 28 tells us that he was put under house arrest. They didn't put him in a prison in a dungeon, so to speak, because he had committed no crime. He was just a political problem.
[time=2001] And so they allowed him to rent his own house there in the city of Rome, but to ensure that he was safe, they chained him 24 hours a day to a member of the Praetorian Guard.
[time=2015] The Praetorian Guard was an elite group originally of 10,000 soldiers that were appointed by Caesar himself to represent Caesar's rule and presence in the city of Rome.
[time=2025] It was kind of the FBI of the day. It was the elite elite group that protected the interests of those in charge.
[time=2033] The way that he would have been chained to this Praetorian Guard, or a member of the Praetorian Guard, would have been with a thing like handcuffs, and yet the chain would have been about 18 inches long, so it would have connected Paul to one of these Roman soldiers, 18 inches, no privacy, no seclusion, no way to get alone, no way to go through the rudimentary tasks of life in any form of privacy.
[time=2057] For two years, Paul has chained to members of the Roman Guard. It was practicing that day for them to shift in and out every six hours.
[time=2068] So in a 24 hour span of time, he would have had four different men, and they probably would have rotated. Often, he may not have had the same guy back again.
[time=2078] Now, I don't know about you, but if I'm the Apostle Paul, and I have spent the last 15 or 20 years of my life roaming all around Asia, minor, and some of the most exciting experiences of my life, taking the gospel to where it has never gone before, and I have a heart and a passion to continue to do that the rest of my life, and I'm a gifted preacher, and a gifted communicator, and this is the stuff for which I was born, and somebody throws me in prison when I haven't even committed a crime.
[time=2106] And I waste for two years there, and then later two more years in Rome, I'm thinking I got some pretty bad circumstances on my hands.
[time=2116] But I want you to notice the key revealing phrase in this first few verses. At the end of verse 12, it reads, "Now I want you to know, brethren, that my circumstances have turned out for the greater progress of the gospel."
[time=2130] He chooses to take the lenses off of his eyes that would say, "I'm being infringed upon in my right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and my prerogative to go share the gospel with whomever I want to, or however the spirit of God would leave me, and for him to become bitter and angry and upset, and allow the circumstances of his life to rob his joy."
[time=2150] He chooses instead to say, "This is great! Look at where I am! This whole thing is turning out for the progress of the gospel. That is his preeminent value. What is it in life that progresses the gospel? And if my circumstances can contribute to the progress of the gospel, I rejoice, and again I say rejoice."
[time=2172] That was his disposition. He's locked up for four years, but he's one of the happiest men on the planet.
[time=2178] The word progress was used in classical Greek to describe the advance of a military army. And what they would do is they'd have to send guys out in front to hack down the trees and the underbrush so a path could be made for the army to move through.
[time=2190] So it implies resistance. It implies moving against opposition. And Paul is saying that my circumstances are allowing the gospel to move against opposition. And he highlights two ways that it's occurring. The first is in verse 13. Look at it.
[time=2205] He's so excited because now my imprisonment in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole Praetorian guard into everyone else.
[time=2214] Paul never viewed himself as being chained to a soldier. He always viewed the soldier being chained to him. It's called a captive witness. Where are you going to go?
[time=2225] You know, you asked the question, if you were to die today and stand before God and you say, "Why should I let you mind heaven, what would you say?" That guy, he's six hours. He's not going anywhere.
[time=2234] And so he would witness to soldier after soldier after soldier. And these soldiers would be assigned to other people. They would come in and they would smize their client.
[time=2243] They would look at who they're two and sometimes I imagine they would be chained even under the actual prison itself with some of the dregs of society, some guys that were murders and rapists and thieves.
[time=2254] And they show up and here's the Apostle Paul with all of his compassion and all of his character and all of his graciousness and all of his wisdom.
[time=2262] There wouldn't have been a question they could have asked him that he couldn't have answered on spiritual topics.
[time=2268] And then in his house arrest it says in Acts 28 that they allowed all kinds of people to come visit him. And so Christians from everywhere would come and unbelievers would come, Jews would come and he would hold class.
[time=2279] I mean, he would preach right there in his own house. And so these soldiers are having to listen to all the communication of the gospel and as Christians would bring difficult questions to the Apostle Paul, he would give them the wisdom of God.
[time=2291] And these elite troops of the Roman army would have first hand exposure to the character and the message of the Apostle Paul and they would come into Christ.
[time=2300] You know that because at the end of the book when he closes that out in chapter 4 verse 21 he says, "Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.
[time=2308] The brethren who are with me greet you and then he kind of says tongue in cheek and all the saints greet you especially those of Caesar's household."
[time=2317] You see, no doubt these little churches all over the Philippi and Ephesus and Galatia, these folks were praying that God would somehow take the gospel to Rome, to the center of all the political decision, then the place from which all the military campaigns were coordinated, where the man himself Caesar resided, they no doubt had been praying that somehow their fledgling little faith in the resurrected Christ would find its way to the epicenter of power.
[time=2344] And so he says to them, "This isn't how we wanted it to occur. This isn't how we've been praying, but I'm here."
[time=2351] And the elite of the elite are chained to me 24 hours a day, they're coming to Christ and they're becoming evangelists.
[time=2358] They're telling their other soldiers and as they head on their expeditions and as they find their ways into the other places of power inside the city of Rome, they are bearing the message of Jesus Christ.
[time=2369] No wonder he's happy. I mean if your number one criteria in life is that the gospel move forward, this is a pananza.
[time=2377] If your number one criteria in life is your own circumstantial happiness, your home, your bank account, your car, your family, your friends, this is a horrible place to be.
[time=2390] Paul's praying, remember verse 9, "I pray that your love would abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment."
[time=2398] He's praying that the fundamental values of our life would be radically transformed by the word of God.
[time=2404] And that what we would hold most dear to us would be the purpose and the person of Christ and you see it in the life of Paul.
[time=2411] It's amazing, isn't it?
[time=2415] We remember John Bunyan because he wrote pilgrims progress but before he did that he was known contemporarily as a great preacher.
[time=2423] They threw him in jail, the Bedford jail for his preaching, but what he would do every Sunday is he would preach still in jail and his voice would waft over the top of the jail there and it would go out and people would gather and there were horns of people that would come to hear this magnificent preacher.
[time=2442] And it frustrated those who had imprisoned him so they stuck him down into the inner sanctum of the prison where his voice no matter how loudly he yelled could not be heard outside the walls of the prison.
[time=2453] And it was there imprisoned and shut up that he finally took the time and had the opportunity to write pilgrims progress.
[time=2464] A book which has given the gospel to millions and millions and millions so you can't contain the gospel and you can't contain men who and women who have at the heart of their existence the progress of the gospel.
[time=2481] He goes on to list another great thing that's occurring, look at verse 14.
[time=2485] He's saying that most of the brethren trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment have far more courage to speak the word of God without fear.
[time=2492] These would be the leaders and the other preachers of all these other churches in this early 1st century church who were being intimidated by the persecution coming from the Roman government and from the Jews.
[time=2503] But what's happening is see they're learning that Paul's in prison and while he's in prison he's bringing these Praetorian guard to Christ and they're becoming evangelists and so they're saying men if that's what happens when you get thrown in prison count me in.
[time=2515] And guys are stepping up to the plate and they're preaching the gospel with far more courage than they ever have before because of his example.
[time=2522] So it's affecting both the unbelieving community and the believing community.
[time=2529] You want joy in your life? You want to be happy?
[time=2536] You want to tell you if you're going to set your focus and your values on your comfort zone, your pleasure, your entertainment, the value of your bank account, the size of your home, the conditions of your work, you are at its whim.
[time=2552] You are at its every whim and you may know moments of happiness.
[time=2556] You may be among the exceptionally blessed and all that goes well and so there'll be a certain level of happiness but the really successful people that I've talked to tell me that even when life goes perfectly.
[time=2565] It's kind of empty and they are missing a sense of joy.
[time=2572] But Paul is illustrating for us in his own life is that whether it's a difficult situation where you feel chained to your desk or you feel chained to an assembly line where you work or you feel chained to your car because you're a salesman a day after day after day, you have to travel and sell or you feel chained to your office as your clients come through.
[time=2591] What are you saying is get past all that. You got to understand this thing about work as a whole lot more and a whole lot bigger than you make in a living.
[time=2600] It's all about the progress of the gospel.
[time=2604] If you can get those lenses on, if you can put those glasses on, you're going to see work in an entirely different way.
[time=2611] And God's going to give you opportunity in your testimony and as you open your lips and as you pursue people after hours to talk to them about Christ and I believe with all my heart based upon the authority the word of God you'll never be happier than if you live like that.
[time=2626] Joy-stealer number two starts in verse 15 and this one is more painful than the first.
[time=2632] It's not bad enough to have bad circumstances. What happens when your good friends betray you? Now that's a joy-stealer.
[time=2639] Some to be sure in verse 15 are preaching even from envy and strife. The some he's talking about are these preachers now that because of his imprisonment have gotten more courage.
[time=2650] So these guys are back in the front lines and they're preaching but not all of them are doing it with pure motives. Let's go again verse 15.
[time=2657] Some of these guys are preaching Christ from envy and strife others are doing it from good will verse 16. The latter do it out of love knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel the former proclaimed Christ out of selfish ambition rather than from pure motives thinking to cause me distress in my imprisonment.
[time=2676] Now folks this is a tough call. These men are likely men whom Paul has led to Christ himself in his missionary journeys and he has cultivated them either through himself or through Timothy or through Titus and raised them up as elders and leaders and preachers and teachers.
[time=2691] They got their theology from his classroom. They got their revelation from the things which God had taught Paul. These are made in his image. These are his men. These are the guys he had built to champion the cause of Christ.
[time=2703] He gets thrown in jail so the King Kahuna is no longer in place and everybody's wondering who's going to be the next leader of the evangelical world. Who's going to be the next Billy Graham. Who's going to be the next Chuck Swindle. The spot is now open and so there are guys out there some of them preaching a true gospel but with with vicious motives selfish ambition in the and strife not from pure motives. They're doing it for themselves. They're hoping to hold the prize position.
[time=2731] Man do you know anything that hurts more than when the people you're counting on the people you've invested in betray you and turn their back on you and use your adversity for their own gain.
[time=2744] How do you handle that? How do you have joy when that's occurring in your life? Look at verse 18.
[time=2751] What then? Which is a way of saying in the Greek so what? Doesn't matter to me. Why? Because I have different values. Only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth here it is Christ is proclaimed and in this I rejoice yes and I will rejoice.
[time=2772] Let me tell you something.
[time=2775] If the highest value in your life is the way other people treat you. If the thing that you have set your affection on is the way that people treat you and you're only to approve or disapprove of your circumstances and feel happy or sad depending upon whether or not they treat you the way you think you ought to be treated.
[time=2794] You are empowering those people to rob and to steal your joy. You have the wrong values. People will hurt us yes and it's human to hurt but it's not to a point of despair.
[time=2809] Paul can look at it and say you know what? How they're treating me really isn't the issue. The issue is that they're proclaiming Christ.
[time=2818] So he shows a total sense of subordination to the cause of Christ. He sets his own interests and the way that people would treat him on a secondary level.
[time=2832] If you're saying things like this you know I could really be happy if only my boss were different. I could be really happy if my spouse would just treat me differently.
[time=2844] I could be really happy if my children would just be a little more obedient.
[time=2850] If those are the kinds of things that are running through your mind as you go through your life I got news for you you got some values that are out of whack.
[time=2858] Those are important issues but the important issue the important issue is am I relating with all of those people in such a way that Christ is being proclaimed and viewed and exposed through my loving self sacrificial attitude as I continue to serve these people who mistreat me.
[time=2875] And in fact I can get excited about treating them that way even though they treat me in ways I wouldn't prefer because there is the spotlight there is the science room or the lab under which I can conduct the experiment of being like Christ and people will look and say man now that person's different.
[time=2897] I would challenge you this more to take a look at the people who are hurting you most. The people who are treating you in ways that hurt you most deeply that strike at your pride and your sense of self worth and your sense of significance and seem to mess up your life.
[time=2917] And put there the greatest value of all values how can I treat this person in such a way that Christ is proclaimed.
[time=2926] I promise you it will radically change the situation it won't change them necessarily they may continue to be a jerk they may continue to hurt you you have no control over them anyway so why worry about it.
[time=2940] What I'll change is your sense of joy and your sense of purpose and your sense of inner strength to move for the cause of Christ don't let anybody take that away from you.
[time=2953] The third one is found in verses 19 and following the third joystealer it says here for I know that this shall turn out for my deliverance speaking of his prison meant through your prayers and the provision of the spirit of Jesus Christ verse 20 according to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall not be put the shame in anything but with all boldness Christ shall even now as always be exalted in my body whether by life or by death.
[time=2981] Verse 21 for to me to live as Christ and to die as gained what's he talking about do you realize every single morning that this guy wakes up.
[time=2991] He's waiting to find out if one man has decided he'll live or die.
[time=2998] All the trials had already been conducted the cases had been heard he was just being held like an all holding tank so that Nero could make up his mind what to do with the Apostle Paul.
[time=3009] Every morning he woke up and didn't have any clue as to whether or not he put his head at the end of that day on his pillow or whether it would be in a chopping block and he would lose his head.
[time=3022] His well-being the third joystealer is a sense of great concern over our physical well-being our health are we going to be alive are we going to exist are we going to continue to go on.
[time=3035] And listen to Paul's dilemma this is an interesting perspective verse 22 he can't decide whether he wants to live or die.
[time=3042] In verse 22 but if I am to live on in the flesh what I like about that is it means fruitful labor for me and I don't know which to choose.
[time=3050] But I am hard pressed from both directions having the desire to depart and be with Christ for that is very much better yet to remain on.
[time=3059] In the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
[time=3062] You want to talk about values you want to talk about the grid through which he views his existence.
[time=3067] Let me tell you what I think most of us we think about not being here tomorrow we think about dying prematurely we're concerned about oh my goodness.
[time=3075] You know I'm not going to be there to see my I'm not going to be there to get the grow old with my wife.
[time=3080] I'm not going to be able to watch my kids grow up I'm not going to be able to be with the grandkids and we're not going to make that great vacation we had planned and what about my business and my hopes and my dreams.
[time=3091] Not Paul. Paul is so impassioned with the person and the purpose of Christ that when he is caught in the horns of a dilemma in the very present threat of life or death over which he has no control.
[time=3103] And the decision at the whim of a leader he's sitting there trying to figure it out based on now man if I get to go to heaven with Christ and that's going to be great.
[time=3111] But if I get to stay then that means fruitful labor for the Philippians for the Colossians for the folks at Ephesus.
[time=3119] He had absolutely totally given himself over to the purpose and the person of Christ.
[time=3126] That was all he could think about that was all he cared about.
[time=3131] Ed Nairam Judson knew something of this he was the first American missionary ever sent overseas.
[time=3138] And he was sent to the primitive and hostile people of Burma.
[time=3143] After he had been there by the way a brilliant scholar very talented and gifted a man after he had been there for 14 years he had nothing to show for his labor except the grave of his wife and his kids.
[time=3154] That was it. Nobody had come to Christ. No big church had started. No theological institute. Nothing.
[time=3162] They were taken by fever and the hostility of the environment and people themselves was just unbearable.
[time=3169] And so there he is. He himself sick with a fever. He himself somewhat disillusioned even as we spoke earlier in our message of the two men.
[time=3178] Wondering where is God in all of this? God if you can't do better than this.
[time=3185] Well as it's written in toward a golden shore the book about his life he finally came to a place where he began to plead with God to let him live for two reasons.
[time=3197] He said God let me live long enough so that I can translate the Bible into the language of these people.
[time=3204] And so that before I die enough people would have come to Christ that we would have a church of a hundred people.
[time=3213] That's amazing in it. My wife and my kids are dead and I'd rather go to heaven but God let me live.
[time=3221] Why so I can get out of this place go back to my homeland recuperate a little bit and at least grab a few years before I pass away. No God let me live long enough to finish the translation work and to see some people come to Christ.
[time=3233] His joy returned. Look at it in verse 20. Here's the fundamental value with respect to life and death.
[time=3244] According to my earnest expectation and hope that I shall not be put to shame in anything but that with all boldness here it is Christ shall even now as always be exalted in my body whether by life or by death.
[time=3257] You want to know joy? You want to know the Christian joy? You want to know the fullness that God gives to you then set that as a foundational value as you contemplate your very existence.
[time=3267] Whether I should live or die the issue has nothing to do with anything other than Christ being exalted in my body.
[time=3276] That's all I care about.
[time=3281] Well the three joy-steelers are covered. I wonder if these were your three circumstances falling apart. In Paul's case in Prisman and the total loss of liberty and the pursuit of happiness as it's been defined for us.
[time=3293] Secondly relationships full of betrayal, backbiting, unsupportive, right at his moment of need and thirdly his own health or his own physical well being life and death.
[time=3305] Aren't those the things that steal our joy? I mean doesn't it all kind of fit into one of those three categories? Well Christ, excuse me Paul gives you the answer.
[time=3314] When circumstances go bad look for the progress of the gospel. Let that be the predominant view and evaluation point.
[time=3321] When people betray you seek that in the way you treat them and respond to them Christ is proclaimed.
[time=3327] And when you are facing life and death situations and the big questions of life ask the question how and in what way will it be that Christ will be exalted in my body.
[time=3338] And when you really set your affections on those I don't mean intellectual ascent. I mean when you do back in verse 9 where your love for these things of bounds more and more like waterfalls cascading down upon themselves that is the abundant overflowing emotion of your life.
[time=3354] The things upon which you choose to set your affections you will know a joy. You will know a joy.
[time=3362] But you'll never know otherwise. You'll be independently wealthy, independent of circumstances, people, and even your own health.
[time=3372] There's a little poem I've been trying to commit to memory because I think it captures this thought. You might want to commit it to yours as well. It says this.
[time=3380] One ship goes east, one ship goes west regardless of which way the wind blows.
[time=3390] It's the set of the sail and not the gale that determines which way we go.
[time=3400] One ship goes east, one ship goes west regardless of which way the wind blows because it's the set of the sail and not the gale that determines which way we go.
[time=3414] Let's pray together.
[time=3431] I hope the music today was a blessing to you. We heard from our sanctuary choir and orchestra from soloist Michelle Smekens and soloist Brian Losen.
[time=3441] The message today was the second in a series in the Book of Philippians. If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, I want to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3453] Dear Heavenly Father, I come to you today knowing that I'm not a Christian.
[time=3459] I've never accepted you as my personal Savior. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and come into my heart today.
[time=3466] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
