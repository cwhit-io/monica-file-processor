[time=0] I don't know if I can live without selfish ambition regarding others as more important
[time=25] than myself. And so Paul gives us three examples of mere mortals, just three normal average
[time=31] ordinary human beings as he closes this chapter out and each of them, though they are different,
[time=37] illustrate the same truth of selfless sacrificial love, a lifestyle that is considering others
[time=43] more important than themselves.
[time=57] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=63] you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Do you ever feel overwhelmed
[time=69] by all the do's and don'ts of Christianity? Does the standard seem too high out of reach
[time=75] and sometimes downright discouraging? Well, stay tuned, because the passage will be studying
[time=81] this morning brings us great encouragement from the examples of three men, a prisoner, a half-breed and a gambler. Our special music today will be provided by Susan Stump and
[time=96] David Staten. Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin
[time=103] our service. "Sing the wondrous love of Jesus, sing His mercy and His grace. In the mansions, bright and blessed, in grief and for some place. When we all are in the midst of the world, we are in the midst of the world."
[time=132] "When we all are in the midst of the world, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace. When we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world."
[time=152] "When we all are in the midst of the world, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world."
[time=177] "When we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world."
[time=202] "Every true and faithful trust in serving everyday."
[time=213] "Just one glimpse of healing glory will last towards the life we pray."
[time=229] "When we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace."
[time=250] "Onward to the Christ before us, to His will, He will be born. Soon that early days will open, we shall dread the streets of course."
[time=266] "When we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace."
[time=286] "When we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace, we are in the midst of the world, when we all sing His mercy and His grace."
[time=316] "I hear the sound of a mighty ocean, when it's close to my, when it's ever back, when it's ever back."
[time=354] "When it's ever back, when it's ever back, when it's ever back, when it's ever back."

[time=762] I thought I had, to see and feel, to prove that what I love was true.
[time=791] But passion turned to ashes, things I held to dust.
[time=804] I found reality in simple trust.
[time=817] My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary.
[time=829] O bless and rock of ages pledged for me.
[time=841] I gladly place my trust in things I cannot see.
[time=853] My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary.
[time=872] And oh what joy to walk this way.
[time=883] I follow nail pierced footprints all the way.
[time=896] And oh the end of where I'm bound, I may not see.
[time=908] I choose to place my trust in Calvary.
[time=920] My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary.
[time=932] O bless and rock of ages pledged for me.
[time=944] I gladly place my trust in things I cannot see.
[time=956] My faith still holds on to the Christ of Calvary.
[time=998] Amen, thank you, Dave.
[time=1006] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bibles and come to Philippians.
[time=1010] Philippians chapter 2 as we continue our study of Paul's epistle to the Philippians.
[time=1017] We'll cover this morning the remainder of chapter 2, verses 17 to 30.
[time=1023] And maybe to help set our thinking for it, I'll ask you the question.
[time=1028] Have you ever been in a cemetery and begun just to look at the tombstones a little bit and let that impact your mind and your thinking about your own life?
[time=1041] For me, I think the first time I'd ever done that that I can really remember was as a young guy in my early 20s and I was in seminary and feeling a little overwhelmed by the level of academic rigor.
[time=1052] They were expecting of me there and also on staff at a church and feeling a little overwhelmed with all that was expected of me there.
[time=1059] Mary, of course, to Heidi and I think Randy was around and feeling like I wasn't quite getting the job done at home either.
[time=1067] And so kind of at the end of my rope, I thought I needed some time alone.
[time=1073] And I chose against some of the parks in the area, fearing I might have been interrupted and landed on a place called Forrest Lawn, which is a mature 35 acre, gorgeous cemetery.
[time=1086] And well developed rolling hills, huge trees and kind of pulled in there and followed one of the roads around until I saw a spot that interests me and parked the car and had to get there.
[time=1097] Under a tree, it was just a gorgeous crystal clear sunny Southern California day and needed some shade and so I was making my way for a tree and on the way I started coming across these tombstones.
[time=1109] And you know how it is. You'll see one that is obviously representing of a little life that hardly made it into the world and died shortly thereafter, another of a young child, another in their teens.
[time=1122] And then you make your way into some of them that these folks, typically a husband and a wife on the same tombstone, they live 70, 80, 90 years.
[time=1131] There's just something about seeing an entire life on one tombstone, all the events, the beginning and the end, the date it started, the date it ended.
[time=1140] I guess think or dream a little bit about what life might have been like for them to put life and perspective and the brevity of life.
[time=1151] And I remember in that day saying to myself, I really just want to know what's important. I want to know what I'm supposed to be living for.
[time=1160] I want to try to fair it out the meaningless of life and not just end up being a name on a tombstone somewhere that lived my 70 years and did my Christmases and my holidays and my work day and all the rest.
[time=1173] I have a sense that I was directed and that I was purposeful and that it was meaningful, that it added up to more than this.
[time=1182] The guy with the name of Joseph Addison says it this way, "When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion of envy dies in me.
[time=1190] When I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out. When I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts with compassion.
[time=1200] When I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must so quickly follow.
[time=1206] When I see kings lying by those who deposed them, when I consider rival wits placed side by side or the holy men that divided the world with their contests and disputes,
[time=1217] I reflect with sorrow and astonishment on the little competitions, factions and debates of mankind.
[time=1223] When I read the several dates of the tombs of some that died yesterday and some 600 years ago, I consider that great day when we show all of us be contemporaries and make our appearance together.
[time=1238] I guess he takes it a step further past even our own sense of I want to have a life that's meaningful to how will God evaluate my life?
[time=1247] What will his standard be? When I am six feet under and only above my head is a tombstone with my name and a date where I began and a date where I end that at least my experience on earth, what is it in God's mind that he's looking for that will evaluate my life positively for the cause of Christ?
[time=1267] Well, Philippians 2, we're finding out, gives answer to that question. It is really a chapter among its peers. It stands out in front of the rest of the New Testament by lifting up the quality of Christ's likeness that is to be found in all of us.
[time=1282] Remember in chapter 2, verse 3, it says, "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mine, let each of you regard one another as more important than himself."
[time=1292] Don't merely look out for your own interests, but also for the interests of others. That in principle, then the example of Christ is given and we remember how Christ left all the glories of heaven and lived on earth and even was obedient to the point of death out of love for you and love for me.
[time=1312] But there is, I guess, in the example of Christ's sense in which it still stands a little bit away from us. Though he was 100% God and 100% man, we can look at his life and say, "Well, I understand why he would live that way." He was God. In fact, that's why he came.
[time=1331] But I'm just a mere mortal. I'm not 100% God and 100% man. I'm just 100% man. And I'm not sure that I can live this way. And I've been listening to you over these many weeks and I've been trying to look at my own life and I just seem so far out of reach.
[time=1347] It seems as if Paul anticipates that need in our own life to see the standard worked out in the lives of just mere mortals.
[time=1357] And so he closes the chapter by giving us three examples from three very normal mere mortals. One of them is a prisoner. The other is a half breed. And the third guy is a gambler. The prisoner a half breed and a gambler. And they're going to show us how mere mortals can live according to the principles established in verses two and, excuse me, three and four of this chapter.
[time=1383] They are three different men but they all illustrate the same truth, selfless sacrificial life. The first is the prisoner and we know him as Paul, verses 17 and 18.
[time=1397] He says there, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all. And you too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
[time=1412] Paul is basically saying, "I am living my life as an offering. I am a drink offering. I am being poured out on your faith and your sacrifice of service. And I counted a great joy."
[time=1427] We're pretty far removed from the sacrificial system of the Old Testament. In fact, I'm intrigued often by people who say they don't shoot animals. They don't do that. And yet they're happy to sit down and have a hamburger or a nice steak.
[time=1442] And I guess in their minds they're so far removed from the slaughtering process that they don't feel like they killed this animal. But somebody did on their behalf.
[time=1449] You know, we just get so removed it just shows up in a sterile little package. The sacrificial system of the Old Testament would have gone something like this and understand the drink offering. We need to think about it just a moment.
[time=1460] The person would have felt guilt for their sin and been given opportunity by God not to die for their own sin, but to have an animal die in their behalf. The shedding of that animal's blood.
[time=1470] They would have chosen an animal, one without blemish or spot or wrinkle, and brought it to the temple where a priest would have taken it from them and slid its throat and then laid it up on top of an altar. Much like a table in front of me here in size.
[time=1487] But made of stone because they would soon ignite the whole thing in fire and it would burn.
[time=1493] Before the animal was placed on the altar, it wasn't uncommon for the person making the sacrifice to put their hands on the animal. To say representative of the identification, this should be me, this should be my death, this should be my blood that would be shed.
[time=1509] Having done that, then the priest sacrifices the animal and lays it on the altar and ignites the fire. And that is the principal sacrifice. That is the main deal. That is the main event.
[time=1522] But there comes a point in the process of the burning of the animal for the drink offering to occur.
[time=1529] And the person who brought the animal would come then with a cup or a glass of some sort, often filled with wine, sometimes with water.
[time=1539] And as that animal was being burned, the participant would then come and pour the offering out onto the drink offering, out onto the main offering.
[time=1548] And it would vaporize at that moment and turn into steam and ascend into heaven. And it would be a way to say that the offering would be acceptable in the nostrils of God, a sweet smelling sacrifice.
[time=1563] Paul says, "I'm the drink offering and you're the real offering." This is the great apostle Paul here. This is the guy that's written most of the New Testament or is in the process of doing so.
[time=1573] This is the one who was personally converted by Jesus Christ on the Damascus road. The one who was then taken into the desert and given massive revelations about the mystery of the church and all that God had designed from ages past that no one had ever known before.
[time=1587] Privileged position and calling and commissioning to take the gospel to the Gentiles, something which had been in God's heart for centuries.
[time=1596] But when he talks about his ministry, when he relates his effort, his stonings and beatings and imprisonments and being whipped and falling sick and the shipwrecks, when he adds up the life experiences that represent his ministry,
[time=1611] he says, "I'm the drink offering and you, the Philippian church, you're the real McCoy. You're what it's all about. I'm tangential to the event. I'm secondary. You can do it without me. I don't view myself as central. I don't view myself as the most important element.
[time=1629] You would almost think of the other way around in his mind, especially that he is imprisoned now for four years. You hear no mention of a complaint, there's no murmuring, there's no grumbling, there's no disputing the will of God. He doesn't say why am I in this condition. He doesn't say how long. He doesn't write to them his gripe against the way that God has ordered his life.
[time=1650] He just lives out the example of Christ, an ordinary mortal human being, and he thinks of them as more important than himself. Just as it says in verse 3, "Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, let each of you regard one another as more important than himself."
[time=1673] He was making the greater sacrifice, though he had the greater commitment, though his was the greater trial, though his the greater effort, though his the greater knowledge, though his the greater privilege and position in the kingdom as an apostle.
[time=1688] He still refuses to view himself as most important and chooses to articulate it in ways that share with them beyond a shadow of it out. I am just an attendant, I am subordinate, I am secondary to your faith.
[time=1705] And then he says, "That perspective brings great joy." Look at it at the end of verse 17, "I rejoice and share my joy with you all."
[time=1714] This isn't something that produces sorrow in my life. In fact, as if he's saying, "I was created to view other people as more important, to be more concerned about their benefit, and when I finally align myself with the purposes of God, even though it means being poured out, his life is being expended."
[time=1731] We do know that he got released from this particular imprisonment in Rome, but shortly thereafter he was re-arrested and his head was separated from his body. It was a sacrificial life, and it was martyred him at the end.
[time=1744] He says, "It's a great source of joy." I mean, I'm really thrilled at the idea of giving my life up for you folks, is what he's saying.
[time=1752] And in the process, I don't overestimate the thing. I'm just the drink offering.
[time=1758] In chapter 3, and we'll look at this more later, but just turn there for a minute and just understand what he's saying.
[time=1764] In verse 8, he says, "I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ."
[time=1779] Everything in my life is lost. Everything in my life, everything I work for is meaningless, now that I know Christ, and I'm in the passionate pursuit of knowing Christ.
[time=1789] And in that pursuit, in that passion of knowing Christ, look at verse 10, "My goal is that I would know the power of His resurrection, and here it is, the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
[time=1807] And for me, this whole thing is just a absolute divesting of myself, because I see what I had was rubbish, dung, human refuse.
[time=1817] There's nothing of any value in what I had done anyway. My life, as I saw it before I met Christ, added up to nothing.
[time=1824] And so, then to come into relationship with Him, and to know that I could pursue His interests in other people's lives, suddenly there's meaning, suddenly there's purpose, suddenly there's a reason to get up.
[time=1835] And so I do it with passion, and I do it to the expending of my own life, but don't misunderstand me.
[time=1843] As I do it, He says, "I understand it secondary to the people I'm ministering to, and also don't think me the sad martyr, don't think me the depressed, poor me down in the mouth, complaining, disputing, grumbling guy."
[time=1862] I've never been happier. I've never been more thrilled.
[time=1868] You say, "Wait a minute now. I thought you were going to talk about ordinary people today. I thought Christ was kind of up on the pinnacle, but you were going to kind of describe people like us. The apostle isn't like us.
[time=1879] I mean, you by your own admission, say He was converted by Christ Himself on the Damascus road, received all the visions. I mean, that didn't happen to me. Don't call an apostle ordinary. Okay, well then come to the next guy. Meet the half-breed Timothy.
[time=1893] Timothy was a half-breed because his mother was Jewish and his father was Greek, and he didn't know where to fit in society.
[time=1899] He was trained by his mother and his grandmother to love Christ and love the things of Christ, and that would have led him at that point in time before they'd known about Christ for him to have been circumcised, but his dad being a Greek refused.
[time=1911] And so externally, he had to live as a Greek in a Greek system, and he found himself between two worlds that were not friendly.
[time=1919] So he's really a half-breed. He is obviously in the middle of two different cultures. He's pretty average. Verse 19, "I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly so that I also may be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
[time=1934] For I have no one else of kindred spirit who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare; for they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
[time=1943] But you know of his proven worth that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father.
[time=1949] Therefore, I hope to send him immediately as soon as I see how things go with me, and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall be coming shortly."
[time=1957] Paul, as you know, from chapter 1 was hoping for his own release, so that he might continue to minister to the Philippians, but in the event that that might not occur, and certainly it wouldn't occur as quickly as need be, he decided to send Timothy back.
[time=1971] Well, who is this Timothy? And how does he tell us or show us the example of living like Christ?
[time=1980] Well, in verse 20 it says, "For I have no one else of kindred spirit." That word means one soul, or one mind, one feeling, one thought.
[time=1992] When Paul and Timothy came upon an occasion, they thought alike about it. They evaluated it the same way, they reacted the same way to the thing.
[time=2001] I guess you know that a little bit with your spouse. Certainly Heidi and I do, we've known each other since 4th grade, and gone to the same schools, and had the same teachers, and had the same friends the whole time.
[time=2012] So when we go to a new environment, whether we're traveling or coming someplace new, we can look at someone, I'll say to her, "Well, who does he remind you of?"
[time=2019] She'll say, "Oh, that reminds me of Kurt Wetterholm, the guy that played the trumpet in the elementary band." And I'll say, "Yeah, that's exactly who I was thinking about, or who is that guy I remind you about?" That reminds me of Mr. Hernandez, our 8th grade science teacher.
[time=2033] We both kind of want to forget him. And then I'll say to her, "Who does she remind you of?" And Heidi will say, "Well, she reminds me of Michelle, one of your former girlfriends, stop looking at her."
[time=2045] You know, I'm caught, because she knows, all about it. So there is this kindred spirit where you just see something, and you're both, it's the same response, that's what he's saying.
[time=2056] Timothy and I, in ministry, we react exactly the same way. Some of you have business partners, and you have a great business because it's very much the same way for you.
[time=2065] You can look at an opportunity and say, "We'll make money there." Or you'll say, "No, no, no, we won't make money there." Or you'll look at a problem and solve it on a long-term basis rather than a short-term basis, and you're just both given to that.
[time=2075] So you don't have much debt in your business, and you're strong and vibrant, or you'll have a concern about how you're being perceived by the people in the community, and so you'll make adjustments, and it's just a kindred spirit. You just work hand in glove.
[time=2086] But with Paul and Timothy, it wasn't the effort of making money or having an image in the community for business. Look at it in verse 20. They have a kindred spirit about something, about people.
[time=2097] Their kindred spirit is that they can genuinely be concerned for other people's welfare. That's where they'd gone together.
[time=2105] They had cultivated this word "concern" in the Greek means to be distracted and burdened for other people's best interest. When they walked into a new city or a new town or a new group of people, what struck them at the same time with the same reaction was, "Oh my goodness, they need, and then boom, boom, boom." They need the gospel. They need to establish this church. They need some elders. They need to repent of that sin.
[time=2128] They would just look past everything else and see the conditions of people's hearts and then be burdened for it likewise. They'd really reached a place of Christ's likeness in their kindred spirit.
[time=2141] One of the joys of life, I think, is trying to disciple people and to share that burden for other people.
[time=2149] And since I've been here, I share with you sometimes as it progresses, but a couple of guys that I've been able to lead to Christ and meet with on a weekly basis, Doug and Wally.
[time=2158] And last year we spent spending time thinking about ourselves, how to pray, and how to study the Bible, and some of the basics in our own Christianity in our life.
[time=2166] But we didn't want to be too ingrown, so this year we've dedicated ourselves to praying and seeking to save those who are lost.
[time=2174] We started a little curriculum that directs our attention towards looking at the lost. It's called Living Proof. It's a book with some videos that go along with it.
[time=2184] And the book explains the principle, and then the videos are professionally acted out scenarios where the principle of personal evangelism gets acted out and you can see it, authentic learning.
[time=2193] You kind of feel like you're there, and you don't have to jump from the principle to your own experience.
[time=2198] Well, this week, we had a tremendous time, and the lesson was all about that evangelism is a process, evangelism takes time, evangelism, you don't bring somebody from not knowing about Christ to come into Christ in a 30-minute conversation, or in a two-week relationship takes time.
[time=2214] And they were talking about some of the barriers, and we need to view it like we're farmers, and be involved in all the stages of a farmer's process to cultivate growth, and finally, at the end, you get to harvest.
[time=2226] Well, the best part of the whole thing was when we turned the video on. And they had, through the weeks past, been showing us how each, this couple had been evangelizing these people, and this single guy had been evangelizing this guy, it was all relational evangelism.
[time=2239] And they wanted to get across to us the patients and the insight and the willingness to really look at the unbeliever and be concerned about his best interest, not closing the sale.
[time=2252] And so they took us to a dreamy state, and then they brought this couple, who we'd only seen in normal clothing, they kind of came on the scene, and they were dressed like farmers, you know, to carry the motif of Luke 4 and the cultivation of the soil, and then they started to talk.
[time=2270] And out of their lips came words of life as they described the couple that they were trying to evangelize, and how at first they were so much different, and they thought there was no possible way that they could build any real links of relationship.
[time=2285] But they've worked through that now, and they've become to appreciate the differences, and actually it's beginning to work to their favor, and there's a sense of softening there, and they're ready to kind of go to the next step in the evangelistic process, and maybe throwing up a flag about the person of Christ.
[time=2302] And then the next person came in and shared, and then the next person came in and shared, and the next person came in and shared.
[time=2307] It was just really well done, but the best part of it all was when we turned it off and turned the lights on, and we had tears in our eyes, and we were just so moved by a group of people that would take the time to be genuinely concerned about other people's interest, even though it was actors on a stage, it was the concept of, boy, that's what Christianity is, isn't it?
[time=2327] Isn't that what it's about? Instead of just running through our lives, and pursuing our own interests, and getting done with our to-do list at the end of the day, and paying the bills to step back from that stuff.
[time=2340] Let's say, yeah, that's got to be done, and we'll get it done, but now I'm really here to look at people.
[time=2347] I'm really here to care, genuinely, deeply, about the condition of people's souls, whether saved or unsaved.
[time=2358] It's kind of an interesting thing here. If you look at verse 21 and chapter 2, and compare it to the same verse in chapter 1, 121 verses 2, 21.
[time=2369] 121 says this, for to me to live is Christ and to die is gain. Paul is affirming this very truth that my agenda, my life, my hopes, my dreams, I don't know what they are anymore, I'm so far removed from them, all I can think about is Christ and His purposes and other people's lives, and for me to live is Christ.
[time=2386] He came to seek and say the lost, and that's why I'm here to compare to 21. What does it say there? For they all seek after their own interests, not those of Christ Jesus.
[time=2401] You want to know truth? You're either in one category or the other. There's no foot and foot, and any given moment in your life, you're either in one category or you're in the other.
[time=2415] I'm not saying about getting saved, I'm not saying just because you got saved, that means you're now to live is Christ, that you're really concerned genuinely about other people's welfare. That's not what I'm saying.
[time=2426] I'm saying even as a believer, at any given moment of your day, you're either in one verse or the other, and it has a tremendous impact on what comes out of your lips.
[time=2439] What's running through your mind? The process is staying over in chapter 1-21, where it's true to say that your heart is really for people. It's just Christ living through you.
[time=2453] Well Timothy shows us some other aspect of the ministry of Christ in his own life. Look at verse 22.
[time=2461] But you know of his proven worth, Paul, speaking to the Philippians about Timothy, that he served with me in the furtherance of the gospel like a child serving his father. Therefore, I hope to send him immediately as soon as I see how things go with me.
[time=2474] That's an interesting phrase. Timothy served Paul like a child serving his father. He had absolutely abandoned himself to the purposes of Christ through Paul's ministry.
[time=2486] He said, "That man's going someplace for Christ. He needs help, and I'm going to serve him like a child serves a father. I'm going to be in his back and call."
[time=2495] If he says, "Go, I'm going to go." If he says, "Come, I'm going to come." If he says, "Stop, I'm going to stop." If he says, "Stay, I'm going to stay." And if you read the New Testament, that's all Timothy did.
[time=2504] In fact, you see that he'll just pick up and move from one place to another as he is here. He's just going to leave Rome where he is, and he's going to go to the Philippians.
[time=2513] Later, he's going to go to the Ephesians. He's just going to go wherever Paul tells him to go.
[time=2519] The New Testament tells us nothing about the fact that he would have had a wife.
[time=2524] There's the strong possibility that he never, ever fell in love or got married. Never had a child. Never had a home. Never had any possessions.
[time=2531] And never could stay in the same place and reap the own, his own personal rewards of building relationships with people.
[time=2537] That takes time. You know, you finally get some. You want to stay there and enjoy them for a little bit. Not Timothy. Timothy's just got moved.
[time=2544] IBM. I've been moved. That's his life. That's where he, because he wanted to just do whatever Christ wanted to do.
[time=2553] Whatever Paul said, "I'll do, I'll do." I'll go. I'll be. In fact, Hebrews 13, 23, we find that he's just come out of prison.
[time=2560] So much like Paul in this process of evangelizing, he too had been thrown in prison. He struggled with it as time. At times, as we saw from 1st and 2nd Timothy, it wasn't all easy.
[time=2574] And he wasn't perfect. But he gave his whole life away. He gave his whole life away. He got close enough to a guy who could give him the same heart attitude as Christ had for people.
[time=2588] He genuinely concerned for people. And then wherever that concern took him, he went. He didn't even get to call his own shots on his life.
[time=2599] The American way seems to be, "I'm going to grow up and be a blah, blah, blah, blah." And then I'm going to live blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I'm going to do that, that, that, that. Now with Timothy.
[time=2608] Timothy humbly submitted to the authority of Paul in his life and said, "You use me however you want to use me."
[time=2615] Whatever you think I can fit into the plan, I'll do it. I'll go there. Sounds a little bit like Christ, doesn't it? Sounds a little bit like Christ.
[time=2624] Giving up the fellowship and the glory and the presence of God in heaven and saying, "This God, you send me wherever you want me to go. I'll go there. I'll do it."
[time=2632] Because I do have a genuine concern for people.
[time=2639] He said, "Well, Alchemy, we've got an apostle. He's hardly ordinary. We've got the appointee and disciple of the number one apostle. He's hardly ordinary."
[time=2648] Can we get to somebody that would just be common? Yes. His name is a Paphroditus. You meet him from verse 25.
[time=2655] We know nothing about a Paphroditus other than what we read in these verses. He is the common man.
[time=2661] But I thought it necessary to send to you a Paphroditus, my brother and fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my need.
[time=2672] Because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.
[time=2677] For indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow, verse 28.
[time=2687] Therefore I have sent him all the more eagerly in order that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.
[time=2694] Therefore receive him in the Lord with all joy and hold men like him in high regard because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service.
[time=2708] We don't know anything about a Paphroditus parents. We don't know anything about his background. We don't know anything about a function that he had in the church, no office.
[time=2717] There's no indication that he was highly gifted as a communicator or as an elder or as a teacher to have won the special affections of the people.
[time=2725] We don't even know when he or how he got saved. He just shows up on these few verses. That's it. That's his whole life. That's all we know.
[time=2731] He's a common ordinary guy with the exception of one thing. He committed a live like Christ, which made him extraordinary. What happened? Let me give you the scenario.
[time=2744] When the Philippians found out that Paul was imprisoned in Rome, they wanted to meet a financial need in Paul's life.
[time=2751] Verse 25, "They sent a Paphroditus as a messenger and minister to my need." The messenger refers to his bringing a gift, a financial gift that the Philippian church had raised, and they had no way to get it to Rome, and so they chose a Paphroditus to carry this gift, and he agreed to go.
[time=2768] "Minister to my needs," apparently means, "and when you get there a Paphroditus, stay there and continue to meet his physical needs. Help him out. Do whatever he needs. Care for the Apostle Paul. Do for him what we wish we could all do, but we can't all go to Rome."
[time=2783] So meet his need. He did that. In the process, he got sick. Verse 27, "Very sick. Deathly ill for indeed he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him." You say, "How did he get sick?"
[time=2797] Well, we don't know exactly. Look at verse 30, "Because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was deficient in your service to me."
[time=2810] That's why I call him a gambler, because the word "risk" here in the Greek could have been translated "gambled." And oftentimes it is in classical Greek. He gambled with his own life to complete what was deficient in your service to me.
[time=2826] Say, "How did that happen?" Well, we don't know. It doesn't tell us. All we know is that he was in Rome. He delivered the money. He stared there as he was instructed to minister to Paul.
[time=2834] And somehow, in the midst of ministering to Paul in the city of Rome, he came to a situation where before he went in, he thought to himself, "If I do that, I may lose my life."
[time=2847] And again, I may not. It's a gamble. But I'm not going to make my decision on that. I want to serve the cause of Christ and so we did the ministry.
[time=2858] Maybe it was a plague. Oftentimes in the early church, a plague would hit a city. Sometimes Rome. And the Christians would be distinguished.
[time=2866] Because the pagans were those who would throw the sick people away from the city and they would discard them as human refuse and get them out of their lives so they themselves would not contact this same plague.
[time=2877] But oftentimes in early church history, it was the Christians who would go and personally expose themselves to that same plague so they could care for the wounds and nurse and feed and protect and cherish their fellow brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=2892] It may have been such a circumstance. Then Paul may have said to a Paphroditus, "Dear sir, there are those who are sick in our city of Rome and they need your care and love, go minister to them."
[time=2904] And thereby show the glory of Christ. Or it may have been that he had to be worked by the Roman government themselves to a point of absolute exhaustion in order to assist Paul, they may have required another additional number of hours to work for the Roman government.
[time=2918] It may have exhausted him and pushed him beyond physical limits. We just don't know what brought him to that sickness. But it's clear it wasn't his own irresponsibility and it wasn't happenstance, it wasn't chance, it wasn't just a common flu or something that got out of hand, it was because of his work for Christ and risking his own life to complete what was deficient in your service.
[time=2939] What a guy, average ordinary guy, no office, no prestige, no sense of being an apostle or even being trained by an apostle. But he was a very sensitive guy.
[time=2954] Why don't you notice in verse 26? Because, I'm sending him back to you, it says, verse 26, because he was longing for you all and was distressed because you heard that he was sick, that he got to follow this.
[time=2968] A Paphroditus goes into this risky situation, has a brush with death, comes out of it okay. By the time he comes out of it okay, he finds out that the church in Philippi had heard he got sick and almost died.
[time=2980] Knowing that the church knew that a Paphroditus becomes distressed, verse 26, he becomes overbearingly stricken with grief for fear that the church at Philippi would be worried about him.
[time=2995] So that's kind of a sensitive heart. I mean he had to be more like John Wayne or Rambo and just not care about it, not care about people and who cares, I was almost dead but now I'm alive and you're worried about it, big deal.
[time=3005] No, I almost died, I'm better and now I know you're worried about my well being and so I can't even function here in Rome anymore knowing that you're concerned about me.
[time=3015] Sensitive heart, verse 28, so Paul sends him back. Therefore I have sent him along all the more eagerly in order that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less concerned about you.
[time=3028] Interesting, isn't it? Well as a result of this, look at how he used to be a steam, verse 29, "Therefore receive him in the Lord with all joy and hold men like him in high regard."
[time=3040] A steam, this guy, lift him up, don't lift the rich in your assembly up, don't lift the powerful in your assembly up, don't lift the good looking in your assembly up, don't just lift the gifted in your assembly up.
[time=3052] Here is a guy who is to be held in high regard, why? Because he came close to death for the work of Christ, risking his own life.
[time=3065] What an epitaph. If that's all that were ever written about me, I'd be happy, wouldn't you?
[time=3071] You would be remembered as an individual whose character was so pure and strong that when they wanted to send money to the Apostle Paul they chose you because they knew you wouldn't steal it, you wouldn't lose it and you wouldn't be foolish
[time=3081] and get it stolen from you. You'd make it, you'd complete the line. You'd also be remembered as a consummate servant who when you got to your appointed destination you served the one you were charged to serve even risking your own life to do that.
[time=3096] You would be remembered as one who was greatly loved both by Paul and the Philippian church and one who greatly loved, so concerned for their concern about him that he had to leave.
[time=3108] Then you would be held in high regard. What more could you possibly want on your epitaph?
[time=3117] Well, so the Lord closes this chapter through the Apostle Paul by giving us some of the detail of people's lives which we don't typically get in the New Testament.
[time=3127] But the thing you see running throughout these closing verses is this, everybody is concerned about everybody else's interests and nobody's really concerned about their own.
[time=3136] Paul, he's in prison, he needs help, a pafforditis was doing that, but he doesn't care about his own need, he cares about the church at Philippi and they're concerned for a pafforditis, so he sends a pafforditis away.
[time=3147] A pafforditis just comes close to death, struggles his way through it by the mercy of God, regains his strength, he's not concerned about himself, he doesn't care that he just about died, he cares about his friends who are concerned about himself.
[time=3161] The Philippian church in the first place raises the money to send him up there to minister to Paul. You see the circle? Everybody in the circle is thinking about the person next to them.
[time=3172] Everybody holds, everybody else is more important, everybody else wants to serve, everybody else.
[time=3179] Paul invites us to live like that, common ordinary folk living in Fort Wayne, he invites us to perceive other people as more important than ourselves and to put that into action.
[time=3196] He encourages not to live for possessions or things or accomplishments or reputation, but for people. Malcolm Muggeridge writes this, "When I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what strikes me most forcibly about it is that what seemed at the time most significant and seductive seems now most futile and absurd.
[time=3216] For instance, success in all its various guises being known and being praised, ostensible pleasures like acquiring money or seducing women or traveling, going to and fro in the world and up and down it like Satan, explaining and experiencing whatever vanity fair has to offer.
[time=3232] In retrospect, all these exercises and self gratification seem pure fantasy, what Pascal called, "licking the earth."
[time=3243] Good to well put, by a guy who tried it all, he's a little bit like Solomon, tried everything that he could put his hand to and he comes to the end of his life when it's too late and says, "You know what, I've been doing all my life, I've been licking the earth."
[time=3257] You come to the Word of God and find here a priority on giving your life away to people for their benefit because you esteem them more highly than yourselves and you come to the fountain of joy and be able to say and know what Christ and Paul knew.
[time=3271] I rejoice when I live like this, I'm never happier.
[time=3279] About a month and a half ago, when Indiana was still warm and the sun was still out and there were still leaves on the trees and they were just starting to color.
[time=3290] Heidi and I ended up going to a funeral to support some friends that was a great day because I didn't have to do anything professional.
[time=3297] I could just go and be ordinary.
[time=3301] But as I've out in the country, quite little ways and this little country church and then this cemetery, you know, and I think it had a couple hundred years represented there in these tombstones.
[time=3312] And we enjoyed the day so much just being outside and all and everybody else kind of left.
[time=3317] Just kind of hand in hand, walking through this place, reading these tombstones and reflecting on what might have been the consequences and circumstances of people's lives.
[time=3329] And again, we felt the same feelings.
[time=3331] You know what really matters on earth is how we treat people.
[time=3338] All comes down to whether or not we're going to give our lives away to love people, our kids, our family, our friends.
[time=3348] We walked away that day having a sense of, well, we're not perfect, but we're sure trying.
[time=3354] We sure feel like we're headed in the right direction.
[time=3358] And I trust that a message such as this will cause you to look at your priorities, the energy and the passion of your life, the checkbook stubs that tell where all your heart is and say, is it another hobby that I'm passionately pursuing?
[time=3377] Where is it people?
[time=3379] Is it a promotion at work that I'm passionately pursuing or is it people?
[time=3384] Is it amusing myself to death or is it people?
[time=3389] And I just believe I can say on the authority of the Word of God that you can stand differently than everybody else in the world who's pursuing that stuff and say, I know I'll know more joy and more satisfaction and more happiness like Paul and like Timothy and like a Paphroditus if I'll just set my sale to serve people.
