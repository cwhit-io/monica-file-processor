[time=0] The New Testament says more about how we handle our money than it talks to us about heaven
[time=15] and hell combined.
[time=19] The New Testament says four times as much about money as it does about prayer, 500 verses in the New Testament about prayer and over 2,000 verses in the New Testament about how we're supposed to handle our money.
[time=30] So as difficult as, or delicate as a subject as it may be, we need to bring it up.
[time=47] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=54] find to be an encouragement.
[time=56] Thank you for joining us.
[time=57] If you're like most people, you have at one time or another deliberately avoided facing up to what the scriptures say about handling your finances.
[time=66] Maybe the subject intimidates you to the point of feeling guilty or perhaps you just find it incredibly dull.
[time=72] But you cannot escape the fact that money matters.
[time=76] People who have failed to handle their money wisely feel like they're sinking in a quick sand never to be pulled out alive.
[time=82] Well, today on the Bible Hour, Pastor Moore shares helpful principles from God's word that will help you discover the rewards of giving, develop a financial plan and determine a standard of living.
[time=94] Our special music today will be provided by Read LaFavor.
[time=100] Let us join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=127] The choir choir should sign for me.
[time=144] Can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's love?
[time=163] My name for me, who calls his name, for me, who he is to tell us who.
[time=182] I'll raise him up, I'll tell him it be, and I'll, my God, to sign for me, I'll raise him up,
[time=207] I'll tell him it be, that I'm my God, to sign for me.
[time=226] Can it be that I'm my God, to sign for me, I'll tell him it be, that I'm my God, to sign for me.
[time=323] I'll raise him up, I'll tell him it be, and I'll, my God, to sign for me.

[time=497] you very much.
[time=527] Thank you. When I enter the gates, I cried holy, the angels are matting there, they carried me from
[time=555] ancient to ancient, and the size that I sow. But I said, I want to see Jesus,
[time=581] He's the one who died for all. I bowed on my knees and cried holy, holy, holy,
[time=609] I clap my hands and say glory, glory to the Son of God.
[time=629] As I entered the gates of that city, hold my loved ones on New-Beware,
[time=648] they took me down the streets of heaven, the seas too many to tell,
[time=667] I saw Abraham, Jacob, and Isaac, talked with Mark and Tim of him,
[time=691] but I said to him, I want to see Jesus, because He's the one who died for me.
[time=711] I bowed on my knees and cried holy, holy,
[time=730] I clap my hands and say glory, glory to the Son of God.
[time=759] I clap my hands and say glory, oh yes I clap my hands and say glory, glory to the Son of God.
[time=788] Glory to the Son of God.
[time=803] Let me invite you this morning in our time available to take your Bibles and come with me to Philippians
[time=818] chapter 2. As you know, we've been studying through this book and we're really going to touch
[time=824] on a verse here and kind of springboard into a theme that I feel I need to talk about this morning.
[time=830] As you remember last Sunday we covered chapter 2 verses 19 to 30 and in those verses there is the
[time=836] example of three godly men, the Apostle Paul, Timothy and a Paphroditus, they are living examples
[time=844] for us of what it means to do what Christ did to consider others as more important than yourself and to give your life a sacrifice for other people and for fear that we would fail to be like that
[time=854] because after all Christ is the god man, the Apostle Paul by the inspiration of the Spirit of God
[time=860] gives us three examples of mere mortals that do this as a way of life, Paul himself and then Timothy
[time=867] and then a Paphroditus. In studying the passage we noticed that in verse 25 the Paphroditus was
[time=874] sent to Rome to care for the financial and physical needs of the Apostle Paul. The church at
[time=880] Philippi having a great love for the Apostle Paul because of his ministry and their life wanted to meet his financial need. Paul was not in prison per se but under house arrest, he was allowed to
[time=891] hire his own house and there be chained to a member of the Praetorian Guard. It allowed him to have great ministry but it was expensive and so the church at Philippi took an offering gathered money
[time=902] together, sent a Paphroditus with this money and encouraged a Paphroditus to stay and minister to the needs of Paul. That also represented financial expense for a Paphroditus to live there and then any
[time=913] needs that a Paphroditus might have been meeting back in the Philippian church, maybe his own family had to be covered. And so we're introduced to the topic of a church having the kinds of resources
[time=923] because of people's faithful giving to do and be involved in ministering to other people's needs.
[time=928] If you're a visitor this morning you should know that I've been here about two and a half years and this will be the second time I've ever raised the issue of money as I'm going to this morning talk about giving and I hope really broaden it beyond giving to the church to kind of a financial plan for you and your family but it doesn't happen all the time. However the New Testament does talk a
[time=950] lot about how we handle our money. You might be interested to know that in the New Testament it talks
[time=957] more about giving and how we handle our money more than it talks about heaven and hell combined. There's
[time=964] more teaching in the New Testament to the believer on how to handle his money than there is about heaven and hell combined. Four times as much or as many verses are devoted to the topic of money how to
[time=974] spend it, how to earn it, how to give it in the New Testament then prayer. Only some 500 verses on
[time=981] prayer over 2000 on money and so it's an important topic. It is also a kind of a difficult topic. My wife
[time=990] and I have learned through the years that we don't just jump into the room and say to the other person hey I've been thinking about our family budget I think we ought to do this. That inevitably ends up in a fight. I don't know how it is in your house but we've learned to say first you know what do you
[time=1007] say maybe a week or so from now we can go to lunch and talk about our budget. We set each other up for
[time=1013] that kind of stuff give each other time to emotionally, mentally and spiritually prepare for these discussions then go someplace nice to have them in public where we're somewhat constrained by the
[time=1023] circumstances and sometimes we make it through there without having hard feelings. It's a sensitive
[time=1031] topic and so I want to bring it with a sense of sensitivity and even caution you as families as I
[time=1038] address you this morning you may want to be sensitive about the topic as you bring it up with
[time=1044] each other in I hope future days and weeks. Let's begin with this thought you know Jesus talks about
[time=1051] Christianity and he describes it in wonderful terms of an abundant life of feeling free, free from
[time=1058] sin and the bondage of sin he says that his yoke is easy and his load is light and I believe that he
[time=1065] is describing for us an inner disposition and a walk that should be full of joy and happiness and
[time=1072] freedom but if you're a Christian and you have mishandled your finances you don't know what he's
[time=1079] talking about anymore because you're in bondage and you have a stress level that is ever rising with
[time=1087] your debt and you're finding a level of anxiety not so much when you have to talk about it and
[time=1093] make some difficult choices but I'm talking about a cloud that kind of moves in on your life and follows you wherever you go to work at home vacation in your recreational pursuits there's this
[time=1105] there's this weight or this darkness this heaviness that seems to cover you because you're aware that your finances are not in order you're unable to pay off your debt maybe barely making it to your interest payments much less some principle and you don't see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel and it doesn't have to be this way if you're there I empathize with you and I have at points
[time=1128] in my life experience some of these pressures it's a horrible place to be it gets so bad that that you realize if an unexpected bill of a thousand dollars would have come into your family's existence you might it might sink your ship and you don't really know where you could turn or where you could go to get help for others it's so tight that somebody would say a couple maybe that you haven't seen for a while after church hey what do you say we go out to lunch and you'd love to and you want a minister to them and care about them and be with them and let them minister to you but you don't have the money to do it and you know to do so is going to add to some
[time=1160] of your debt or to delay your getting out of debt and so you're constricted it it's anything but
[time=1167] freedom it's anything but but the privileged abundant life that the Lord would have for us to live we're anticipating Christmas many of you are wondering where in the world are we going to find the money to buy even the most simple presents for our kids so it's hard it's hard and I want to lay
[time=1184] out the basics this morning of a financial plan and if you're already there and this is old hat
[time=1190] to you then you rejoice that God has worked in your life and you're already there but for many of you I suspect if we're anything at all in comparison to the statistics about the people who live in America
[time=1200] this may be very much needed instruction and just a nick of time to get you on a process and a path
[time=1207] towards handling your finances that represents the biblical truth and and real health for you and your
[time=1213] family I want to do that by laying out a basic principle this morning about money and then draw
[time=1219] three implications from that basic principle the principle is this God owns everything
[time=1227] God owns everything in the world and everything that everybody thinks they possess
[time=1234] God owns everything you own everything you have he owns everything in your bank account
[time=1240] he owns your cars he owns your house he owns all of your investments everything he owns your
[time=1247] clothing your shoes he owns everything he owns it all and what God is requiring of us is to be
[time=1254] faithful stewards of what he has entrusted to us God says this the silver is mine and the gold
[time=1261] is mine declares the lord of hosts haggai two eight in that reference he's talking about all the
[time=1268] nations of the world I own it all in every nation of the world I own all the silver and all the gold
[time=1274] and those are representative of whatever wealth those people might have he also says but you
[time=1280] shall remember the Lord your God why for it is he who is giving you the power to make wealth
[time=1287] Deuteronomy 18 not only does he own everything but whatever power you have intellectual power
[time=1295] physical skills business sense whatever your job is whatever energy and power you have the
[time=1302] generate an income the power comes from God to you to do that so even the money that you make even
[time=1309] the resources that you're able to generate the power to do that comes from God he also says
[time=1315] and what do you have that you did not receive first Corinthians 4 7 you say well I didn't receive
[time=1322] anything my parents weren't wealthy and I haven't received any inheritance and I basically had to
[time=1328] fight and scratch my way through life I paid my way through college and I'm now pulling myself up by my bootstraps and I'll tell you this whatever I have I earned and I worked hard for and from a
[time=1338] human vantage point the horizontal level of life that may be true and maybe you haven't received a lot of gifts and inheritance and head starts and those kinds of things and so from that sense you've worked hard and the Bible commend you for working hard but in light of the first two references remember that everything you have is a gift from God even the power and the energy to
[time=1359] work for it is the gift from God and even after you work for it he owns it all we have personal
[time=1365] possession of absolutely nothing that's the place to start that is the biblical perspective about
[time=1374] possessions and then there is this this finishing thought to this principle first Corinthians 412
[time=1381] what he requires of us is to be faithful stewards to handle what he has entrusted to us in ways that
[time=1388] please and glorify and honor him so the question is then well what does he want me to do with the money
[time=1394] he's given me what does he want me to do with the wealth that he has entrusted to me if he owns it all and he's given me the power to earn it and even after I've earned it it's still all his and I'm to view it as something I've received from him what does he want me to do with it well here are the three implications of the principle number one he wants you to give back to him a portion of what he
[time=1415] has given to you he wants you to give Proverbs 3 9 says this honor the Lord from your wealth and from
[time=1423] the first of all your produce now only does he want you to give back to him he wants that to be the
[time=1430] very first thing you do when you and I receive our paychecks the very first thing God wants us to do with
[time=1440] that money is give a portion of it back to him now many of us consider this giving as a debt that we
[time=1448] owe we categorize it in there with the mortgage and with taxes and with the car payment and then oh
[time=1455] yeah oh yeah there's giving to the church it's just yet another debt and I want to help you this
[time=1461] morning with that come with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 9 it doesn't have to be that way that is a bare minimum perspective and I think there's a whole bunch of truth and the New Testament that can
[time=1472] help you look at it completely differently than that I know that's God's desire for you instead of viewing your giving to God as a debt that you owe view it as seed that you sow seed that you sow
[time=1485] an investment that you're making 2 Corinthians 9 verse 6 now this I say he who's spare who so's
[time=1494] sparingly shall also reap sparingly and he who so's bound to flee shall also reap bound to flee
[time=1500] verse 7 let each one do just as he has purposed in his heart and not grudgingly or under compulsion
[time=1506] for God loves a cheerful giver and God is able to make all grace abound to you that always having all sufficiency and everything you may have an abundance of every good deed as it is written he scattered abroad and he gave to the poor his righteousness abides forever now he who supplies
[time=1523] seeds of the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase
[time=1530] the harvest of your righteousness you will be enriched in everything for all liberality which
[time=1536] through us is producing thanksgiving to God now I don't know a whole lot about farming
[time=1543] but you ought to to preach this text so I studied it and then I called a friend who's a farmer
[time=1549] here in Fort Wayne and what you find out about this notion of sowing seed it's a different
[time=1557] thought it's a different concept when a farmer buys a tractor it begins to depreciate
[time=1563] immediately that can help him on his taxes but the fact is the value of this tractor is instantly
[time=1569] starting to go down and the more he uses it and the longer he holds it the less value it is to him and then of course there is the fuel that he puts into his tractor and that all gets consumed and when it's over he's got to get more fuel and then there is the labor those he hires to help him with the process and when they have done their job they're expended and they need to go out and buy new labor or more labor or hire them again for further jobs but with seed it's completely different
[time=1596] seed is the one part of the operation that makes the whole operation work if the farmer sowed a bushel
[time=1604] of wheat and he only got one bushel of wheat back or worse yet the wheat like the tractor and the
[time=1611] labor and the fuel disappeared he's out of business the fact is when a farmer on the average
[time=1619] sows a bushel of wheat he gets 25 back that's what keeps him in business if he sows a bushel of soybeans
[time=1629] on the average he gets 50 bushels back and if like most smart Indiana farmers he chooses to sow corn
[time=1639] one bushel of corn returns 450 bushels you see you drive by and you say look at the corn
[time=1646] farmer drives by and says look at all the corn that's my business that's how I survive
[time=1654] because I sow corn and the wonderful principle is I always get many fold and return more than I
[time=1663] ever put in the ground in the first place you see and so God comes to us and says I want to talk to you
[time=1669] about your giving I want you to be faithfully in the process of sowing your investment with God
[time=1676] and be assured I will return far more than you've ever given I will make it produce greater things
[time=1684] than you have given look at it in verse 10 he says it now he who supplies seed to the sower and
[time=1691] bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness so God is inviting you and me to take from the energy that he has given us the money
[time=1709] that we have earned in which he still owes I mean owns he gives us the privilege of taking a portion of that and and sowing it in the well prepared fields of his kingdom and he wants us to view it
[time=1722] as the smartest investment we could possibly make and anticipate huge returns you say great this is
[time=1729] super I'm glad I came in church today because I'm kind of behind and my finances aren't running well and if what you're telling me is that I can expect a 25% or 25 yield on my dollar I give you a buck
[time=1742] today and sometime like how long do I wait for this I mean do I get a raise next week or the week after or something like that some preachers have preached this passage this way I call them hucksters
[time=1753] and thieves and liars and stealers and cheaters and what they do is they get on the airwaves of television and they talk to the people who don't have very much money and they tell them if you'll send us ten dollars God will give you a thousand back then you just wait he'll be faithful to do that and so these guys pull the wool over these people's eyes and they get fabulously wealthy and rich
[time=1775] and these poor folks are bamboozled you say well then what is the passage saying
[time=1781] well there is the possibility and you'll hear some testimony later in the message that because
[time=1788] you have been faithful to give the God there is the sense that in hard times God is faithful to make your life work financially but you can't tie it to merely financial things he's inviting
[time=1801] you to sow in the kingdom of God and to reap in the kingdom of God and that may include spiritual blessings as well and those may be delayed your lifetime before you reap them the average crop
[time=1813] is in its six to eight months before we harvest it CT stud in the 1800s was one of England's greatest
[time=1820] athletes remembered for that a great cricket player devote Christian young man received an
[time=1827] enormous inheritance of twenty nine thousand pounds and back then it would have converted to fifteen hundred a hundred and fifty thousand dollars which then would have been an absolute fortune I mean imagine a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in the 1800s well he didn't want
[time=1841] to be bothered by the money he didn't want to be distracted by it he didn't want his focus to get off what he thought God might have for him so he took a third of it and gave it to Hudson Taylor
[time=1850] the China inland mission he took another third of it and gave it to William Booth who was starting
[time=1856] the Salvation Army he gave another third of it and gave it to D L Moody who at that time thought God
[time=1862] wanted to go to India now you want to talk about returns folks do you know what this guy invested in
[time=1869] Hudson Taylor was the only man in his generation to break through the whole mainland of China with
[time=1875] the gospel in order to do so he had to break away from his mission agency which was mad at him
[time=1882] for continuing to become more like the Chinese people he went through a process in order to give them the gospel he started to dress like the Chinese people and eat like the Chinese people and learn their language and it was only after this long transforming process that the gospel seed finally took to the soil and began to produce a spiritual harvest today we think there are some fifty million
[time=1903] believers in China and most of those are going to find their spiritual roots back to Hudson Taylor
[time=1909] and his coming with the gospel CT stud funded it when he gets to heaven he's going to be blown away
[time=1916] when he finds out what God did with his investment that was just one of them then there's William Booth and the Salvation Army and its early days it was strongly evangelical and it did a marvelous
[time=1927] ministry of presenting the gospel and thousands of people came to Christ as you know D L Moody decided
[time=1933] not to go to India but found his way back to Chicago and started what we call Moody Bible Institute
[time=1939] if you're ever in Chicago please go by and see that place and spend some time walking down their hall of fame you'll find your way to a plaque that must be eight feet long and four feet high
[time=1950] and these little itty bitty names of people written very small of their name and what mission field
[time=1957] they're serving in all over the world thousands of them have been trained up those are just the
[time=1963] leaders that got trained through the Moody Bible Institute and who have been reaping a spiritual harvest in all the nations of the world for now over a hundred years you want to plant corn you want
[time=1976] to return God is saying don't view you're giving to me as a debt I'm locking you into one of the most
[time=1984] exciting concepts known to humanity that you can take physical resources which I have given you
[time=1991] invest them in the kingdom and receive eternal dividends from such an investment so the first
[time=2000] thing God wants you to do is give and we'll talk more about how much a little bit later but for now
[time=2007] God wants you to take that paycheck and say the first thing I'm going to do with this thing is give
[time=2013] and invest to the kingdom of God secondly God wants you to save God wants you to save
[time=2020] God wants you to learn from the little Miss Ant there in Proverbs 6 who prepared her food in the summer
[time=2026] and gathered her provision in the harvest you see she knows that there's coming a time when she can't produce a harvest and she can't gather food because the weather's going to change circumstances will be different and if she doesn't do it now when she can then later when she needs it she'll starve to death Proverbs 21 there is a precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise in the house of
[time=2051] the wise people you can find treasure and oil there but a foolish man swallows it up they don't
[time=2060] save they consume as fast as they can and their consumption excuse me spends all their income they
[time=2069] don't save any they don't ever pay themselves for their labor listen to this social security reports
[time=2078] that only 2% of Americans are financially independent at 65 years of age 2% of us
[time=2085] what happens to those who aren't 30% of them need charity to survive 23% of them need to continue
[time=2093] to work to survive and 45% of them must find help from relatives because they weren't in the process
[time=2101] of being like the little ant in Proverbs 6 and storing up a little as they had opportunity when there
[time=2107] was opportunity now because we can feel overwhelmed by this and you say well you know I think it's only
[time=2116] the really really rich people who can save money for the future I mean I barely can live here I barely can make it you know month to month and so so sometimes you get overwhelmed and you don't
[time=2128] even try well let me give you some information that I think should help you try and try harder and I think you can be successful at this number one I think got to start a little freedom fund for you and your wife and you're looking to the day of retirement and you say well how much should
[time=2143] I start with well let's be aggressive and say you might consider giving 10% of your income
[time=2150] to your freedom fund listen to the rewards if you only made $15,000 a year that's just a
[time=2157] little bit above poverty $15,000 a year you took 10% of it and put it in an investment that would return 9% now that may be high or low depending upon the economy at any given time maybe mutual funds
[time=2169] money markets 9% return 10% of 15,000 is $28 a week
[time=2178] you find $28 a week put it in that fund and in the 25 years it'll be worth $138,000
[time=2187] that's a lot of money if you make $25,000 a year and you take 10% that's $50 a week put it in that
[time=2196] mutual fund $230,000 if you make $40,000 a year you set 10% of that aside that's $80 a week
[time=2208] $369,000 you say well that's a nice tribe but I don't know where I'm going to get 10%
[time=2215] I don't know how to do that well Kipplingers personal financial magazine I happen to run across
[time=2222] this week article august 93 about penny pinching this family the Engelhart family got transferred from
[time=2230] New Jersey to Long Island and the income went down the cost of living went up and they were strapped
[time=2236] had no idea how they would survive so they listed a bunch of ways to pinch pennies and I pulled out four of them just in an effort to be practical and an effort to really incite you to do this these kinds of things to realize you can and should be saving for your future are you ready
[time=2251] here they are number one they replaced their incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent light bulbs
[time=2257] it saved them $480 a year
[time=2263] she gave up the mother gave up her drying machine her dryer for a cloth drying racks they figured
[time=2269] in their energy was expensive where they lived it was a dollar a load to run the thing so they saved $500 a year there then the mother began to cut everybody's hair the husband and the two boys
[time=2282] that was an annual savings of $520 then they planted a vegetable garden they took proverb six really
[time=2290] seriously became like the aunt harvested their own food that saves them $1,500 a year now I had that
[time=2297] up it's $3,000 say that for 25 years 9% interest over $300,000 it's not that far out of reach
[time=2307] it really can be done or you can do what I do by a dog you're saying how does that work or my
[time=2316] dog choose everything in sight my dog chewed my cable I don't watch TV anymore you know he chewed
[time=2322] my cable so we thought well as long as we're not watching it we may as well not pay for it well there's that savings every month that could go towards your savings account just buy a dog now don't ask me about dog food and and that bills but find a creative ways you know they say that Fort Wayne is the
[time=2339] restaurant capital of America I was out to dinner this week with some friends we went to the outback over there in Clinton new steakhouse we asked the manager why did you guys pick Fort Wayne they have a couple of them down in India he says well because Fort Wayne is the capital the the restaurant capital of the Midwest and we said why do you call it that because of about 300,000 people live here and they don't have anything else to do but eat is that true we just go out to eat right
[time=2364] see well you could cut down on that from time to time and start your your freedom fund I don't know
[time=2374] so the first thing I want you to do with the money he's giving you invest in the kingdom of God the second thing you want you to do is save save for your future now here's the big one the third one
[time=2386] the next thing you want you to do is live on what is left set your standard of living on what is left
[time=2394] and live there you say boy now you're tampering with my life let's assume you give 10 percent
[time=2403] let's assume you set 10 percent aside for savings a little bit of math 80 percent of your income is left
[time=2409] live on it live on it let me ask you a question who is setting your standard of living
[time=2416] do you ever think about that this might be one of those questions you could go to lunch with your
[time=2422] spouse and ask this question carefully who is setting our standard of living here's some options
[time=2429] one our parents for some crazy notion the people of america assume that if their parents live that
[time=2435] this standard of living well we ought to too because there are parents what does that have to do with
[time=2442] anything they grew up in a different era they had different jobs they they had different economic
[time=2448] situations that faced them and by the way they're a lot further down the road than where the younger group might be there's no guarantee that you're going to live at the standard of living of your parents or better for that matter none whatsoever but it puts a lot of pressure on us unless we
[time=2464] identify and look at it and say you know what we're trying to keep up with a standard of living that they had and as a result we're making bad financial decisions we're not investing in the kingdom and
[time=2474] we're not saving for our future we're spending all of our available dollars trying to keep up with somebody else's standard of living and it's putting us in bondage and then we have to live with all the anxiety and the grief and the sense of that cloud over our lives because we know we're not handling our finances properly and you got to break free of that how about your peers are you trying
[time=2496] to keep up with your peers this can happen very easily this happened to hide in eye a little bit we happen to have gone to college and met some great friends strong Christians we grew together in
[time=2507] the Lord we played golf together we just had all kinds of things in common and we just got along wonderfully and then I went into the ministry and as you know you don't quite make as much money the other guy went in as an attorney and the other guy went to be a banker and with time without any
[time=2524] of us even noticing it they started just making huge amounts of money huge amounts of money
[time=2530] and there we were you know on a on a pastor's salary and all of a sudden hiding our thinking
[time=2537] how do we do this how do we keep up or we can't and that's okay that's how God has that
[time=2544] but unless we identify it admit it and deal with it there's a subtle little energy inside saying
[time=2551] we got to try to keep up we got to try to keep up maybe the media you look on the media you see
[time=2558] things and you go oh that's what I want or I need that I think one of the American pastimes is going to the mall to find out what else we can want you understand I don't go to the mall very often
[time=2568] because I just want oh boy I wish I had that and oh that would be really trick and oh if I just
[time=2574] could get that I just you're clear so you got to look at what you're trying to compete with
[time=2580] you got to determine your own standard of living and live inside of it here's a principle for you
[time=2587] never finance pleasure items never finance pleasure items I talk to people who are still paying off
[time=2593] their vacation never do that never finance pleasure items never finance a new TV or furniture or
[time=2601] clothing save up and then buy it why because if you're in that habit and you're starting to cultivate
[time=2609] that appetite in your life and you say well I want that and I can't afford it so I'll go charge it
[time=2617] well then you find out you get it whatever it is the new TV or the clothing and it doesn't satisfy you it doesn't make you forever content it doesn't remove what was in you in the first place that thought your life would be better if you just had it so you charge that well then I'll charge this and we'll all charge that and then I'll charge this and before you know it you're charged out you're all out of money and you're under the cloud and there's no way to escape or at least it seems
[time=2645] how about this instead of taking pride what I mean by that is evaluating yourself worth and thinking
[time=2652] yourself of value based upon your standard of living think about yourself and yourself worth
[time=2660] based upon how effectively you're managing what God has given you have a sense of real accomplishment
[time=2667] and integrity and pride in the fact that though you may not drive a new car or though you may not be able to take the nice vacation or though you may not have this and that and this what you do know about you is that you are properly handling and managing what God has given to you there should come
[time=2685] your sense of well-being and your sense of pride your sense of wholeness if you do if you practice
[time=2694] good stewardship you're cultivating in yourself the thing that money can't buy and that's character think of it in order to do this it takes wisdom and discipline and perseverance and courage and
[time=2704] conviction and willpower that's what you buy when you manage your money properly and that's
[time=2713] where your sense of self-worship come from the character that you're building listen to this money is the substance money is the substance that can buy us everything but happiness
[time=2727] and take us everywhere but heaven you might memorize that that helps you live inside your standard
[time=2734] of living money is the substance that can buy us everything but happiness and take us everywhere
[time=2741] but heaven money can buy books and tuition at a university but money cannot buy brains and knowledge
[time=2748] money can buy all the medicine pills and treatments that the medical community has to offer but money
[time=2754] can't buy health money can buy you a house maybe even a big house with a view of the ocean and a pool
[time=2761] and a tennis court but money can't buy you a home money can buy you into the company of famous
[time=2767] people great people prestigious people but money can't buy you one friend right money can buy you a
[time=2776] king size bed over stuffed pillows and an expensive down comforter from europe but money can't buy you
[time=2783] sleep and rest money can buy you an expensive gold-plated crucifix
[time=2791] but money can't buy you salvation money can't buy you anything of value
[time=2797] the things that really matter money can't buy souls and eastern said it this way we are always
[time=2803] paying dearly for what is cheap that's America we are always paying dearly for what is cheap
[time=2812] and the true resources and the true riches which God offers us freely in Christ and in the community of the redeemed and strong vital caring loving relationships that's all free all you got to do is come
[time=2823] and get plugged in and make a personal investment of your own time in these things but you don't you can't buy that stuff I know people with millions of dollars millions of dollars whose home is a wreck
[time=2839] and all the money in the world can't put their home back together which is more valuable so why
[time=2846] why run after a standard of living why run after things when things can't satisfy and money can't
[time=2853] buy what you really want why not instead take real pride and a real sense of integrity in building
[time=2860] your character to handle your money in ways that bring glory to God
[time=2868] well as I closed this morning giving you know is a very personal thing the Bible tells us to do it
[time=2875] in secret and that's how we do it here we do it in secret I have no idea who gives what I have no
[time=2881] access to that information people give me money like after church they'll give me an envelope that they forgot they give in the plate and I never leave this building with it I hand it to somebody else there are a few very few people up in the business office that could even have access to that kind
[time=2894] of so giving a secret and giving me to stay secret because it says in the Bible that if you give for the honor of men if you given such a way as to be known by men that you give then you have your reward and fall in other words there are plots in your life or their knowledge if you're giving that's all there is to your reward and God wants to reward you in heaven so you give in secret but sometimes you can keep it so secret that you lose the opportunity to learn what other people
[time=2917] are doing and be challenged by their giving and be challenged by their commitment and so I send a
[time=2923] survey out this week I send a survey by random the computer scrambled the thing to half of our elders
[time=2930] half of our deacons and half of the senior staff the leaders of our church so that I can share with
[time=2937] you their example without letting you know who it is and without letting me know who it is because I told them when you send the information back either type it or write it with your left hand so that we don't know who it is and they did successfully do that four questions how much do you give
[time=2953] question number two describe the circumstances which brought you to give regularly and faithfully question number three comments or suggestions you would have the people who are considering giving
[time=2964] more faithfully or increasing the percentage of their gift and question number four has your
[time=2970] commitment of giving ever been tested while I've just selected three the first one I give 13 to 15
[time=2978] percent of my gross income describe the circumstances which brought you to that I first realized that
[time=2987] giving was part of worship in 1974 my wife and I began giving 10 percent of our gross at that time
[time=2995] my wife had been taught in her childhood to give 10 percent but I had not after hearing our first
[time=3001] message on giving as a married couple we began giving 10 percent or more every year since then
[time=3008] what suggestions do you have for someone who is considering this kind of commitment my wife suggests trusting in the Lord to eliminate fears he will take care of you that's kind of interesting
[time=3021] footnote there in the study I did this week it showed that when families get into debt big debt
[time=3027] it's typically because of the man in the family the female is the one who is seeking for more security and so she's much less apt to go out there and spend a whole bunch of money that puts them in debt now how that works with all the credit card jokes and women I don't know but that's what I that's what I was told so apparently the women are more conservative on that did you hear about the
[time=3047] did you hear about the guy actually there's a galsh who is standing there at the counter in this
[time=3053] department store she's buying a bunch of stuff and she said to the lady she said do you mind if I pay with cash and the lady behind the register said well no not at all in fact you could pay with check
[time=3062] or with credit card and the lady said oh no I never buy with a credit card and the man standing
[time=3069] next to her over here in the conversation said will you marry me I'm sorry I couldn't resist okay so
[time=3078] that he goes on he says I would suggest that people consider giving their fair share to the local
[time=3086] church organization and more as an offering of worship give what you believe in your heart should you should give as your commitment ever been tested no we have never been in such financial strates that we considered not giving survey number two how much do you give at least 10 percent
[time=3102] for all my earning life how did you begin I began tithing when I first began to earn money I was
[time=3108] taught that principle by my parents both by word and action and by the teaching of my church
[time=3114] it never seemed as if it should be optional I don't believe there has ever been a time when I slash we didn't at least tithe how did you start or no excuse me what recommendations would
[time=3126] you give to those considering starting here's the answer start exclamation point start giving
[time=3132] on a regular basis with at least a certain percentage of your income if you can't begin with 10 percent then start with three or four percent at some level do it regularly do it first before
[time=3143] other bills are paid don't let it be optional next year commit to increase the giving level by one
[time=3149] percent after a few years you will be at a level of 10 percent or more has your commitment to give
[time=3157] ever been tested answer I suppose our commitment is always tested but yet it has never been seriously
[time=3163] tested money is always tight and everyone would like to have more when the cars get old or when we
[time=3170] look at the lifestyles of others we sometimes say that we could afford that if we didn't give at the level we do when we have paid the costs of education in addition to our regular giving we occasionally
[time=3182] question the commitment but never seriously on the other hand God has always met our needs and we
[time=3188] are grateful for his provision for us and for our children one last survey I give 12 percent of my
[time=3197] gross income and I have been in the practice of doing that for the past 30 years and that's faithful
[time=3203] what were the circumstances I was taught that I should give a portion of any money I receive
[time=3212] even as a child by my parents before marriage my wife and I discussed giving we made a commitment
[time=3219] to give at least 10 percent of gross earnings to the church we decided that any giving outside the
[time=3226] church should be an addition to our commitment to the church what comments or suggestions would
[time=3233] you have to someone who is considering a commitment to give on a regular basis we feel that giving is a very important focus of worship that should not be neglected I like to think of it as important
[time=3243] as personal devotions prayer and church attendance the Lord commands us to give and if we want to
[time=3249] please him it becomes an automatic part of our worship it should be viewed as something we look forward to doing an appreciation for his faithfulness to us after all since God gives us life and
[time=3260] salvation and all that we possess it's only fitting that we should return to him a portion of what
[time=3266] he has entrusted to us has your commitment ever been tested answered yes there was a time when my
[time=3275] income was low and expenses were very high on paper and using earthly logic it would appear that
[time=3282] we could not possibly keep our commitment to the Lord on giving the Lord saw us through those lean years we didn't have all we wanted and in fact we had to on occasion give some things up such as
[time=3294] buying salt for the water softener or replacing a leaky faucet etc but we experienced God's faithfulness
[time=3300] in meeting our needs reality was that on paper we wouldn't and couldn't survive but somehow God
[time=3307] stretched these dollars and met our needs I believe he chose I believe he chose to honor us because we
[time=3316] gave to him first those are great testimonies aren't they wish I had time to have read them all they
[time=3324] were very similar in nature I added up all of of the percentages divided by the number of people
[time=3331] and found that the average was 13% giving to the church giving matters are personally determined by
[time=3339] the New Testament there is never in the New Testament a command that you should give 10% there is the command to give to give faithfully to give cheerfully to invest to give regularly and to give out a
[time=3349] portion out of what you've received a starting point a benchmark a place that would let you know
[time=3356] where the rest of the leadership of the church is is shooting for and achieving might be that point of 10% well I trust that as we spend the time here this morning you'll take to heart what is
[time=3367] being said and really my heart for you this morning is that you'll put your finances in order what
[time=3373] I'm mostly concerned about is fellow believers walking around into the cloud and the pressure of the
[time=3379] guilt of knowing that they're not handling their money in ways that honor God the truth is this
[time=3385] if you honor God with your money and if you show yourself faithful in the financial stewardship of your life he'll give you spiritual riches to care for ministry opportunities that'll open up before your eyes and you'll be thrilled to know you're helping in the cause of Christ well let's pray together

[time=3543] Bible hour
[time=3556] cycled and brought to Christ though they preached to cause me strife and preached to cause me distress in my imprisonment verse eighteen but I I rejoice why because Christ is proclaimed and then in the next few verses of the chapter when he thinks about his own physical well-being
[time=3572] and the very real possibility of death at the hand of Nero he says at the end of verse 20 it doesn't matter to me because Christ even now as always will be exalted in my body whether by life or by death
[time=3583] and then finally in this chapter he addresses citizenship and how to have joy in the midst of a hostile culture and a hostile government installed by that culture can he says folks ladies and gentlemen
[time=3594] let me give it to you straight stand together as the body of Christ unified in one heart and one mind striving together not for your national rights not for your personal rights not for your economic rights not for your political rights but for the faith of the gospel let it all go
[time=3610] and stand for the truth of the gospel and then he says and you can anticipate suffering for that
[time=3616] there will be some blows that will come your way but even then remember it's the gracious privilege of God that would allow you to suffer for the sake of Christ it's quite a standard isn't it
[time=3629] you set your heart free to be there as I'll pray to set my heart free to be there and as I say very
[time=3636] convicting confrontive message for me I believe we'll know a level of joy that we've never known before
