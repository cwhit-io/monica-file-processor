[time=0] We look at Esther, we see a woman who is set in place to be used by God.
[time=18] And by God's design, she will become later in the story, heroin of the Jews.
[time=23] But we need to understand that she had some flaws.
[time=27] She had some faults.

[time=379] [MUSIC - 278 seconds]
[time=665] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=667] I hope this has been a good week for you as you celebrated Thanksgiving and I hope you had opportunity to be with special friends and family that you don't ordinarily -- you aren't ordinarily with.
[time=677] We had that opportunity to have our children home and it was a great time of fellowship.
[time=681] We're also -- you've been busy the last week or so and we want to hear a little bit about some of your experiences.
[time=686] Well, thank you. I had the privilege of going out to California and ministering at the Master's College in Seminary.
[time=692] Just a tremendous time. The chapel at the college about 800 college students and they're excited about the things of God.
[time=700] They sing so wonderfully a real heart of worship and then the opportunity to teach them the Word of God is always a thrill because their hearts are so moldable at that age and teachable.
[time=710] So I really felt the spirit of God there and then the next day over at the Master's Seminary and that's growing leaps and bounds.
[time=718] I think they have nearly 200 students, men, really in training for the ministry and had an opportunity to challenge them with the practical side of their faith.
[time=727] Not just to be so absorbed in the studying of God's Word but to be involved in personal evangelism and personal discipleship which was an area of real struggle for me when I was in seminary.
[time=738] Just because the focus seems to be so academic and I think that was well received too. So I was thankful for that.
[time=745] There's an excitement and just a need aura in the college campus and I do appreciate that sense of anticipation and absorption that the kids have when you speak to them.
[time=757] Now you not only spoke at Master's College but you had the opportunity to fill the pulpit for Dr. John McCarty.
[time=763] Right and that John was at a Southern Baptist Convention preaching to about 3,000 pastors and so he needed somebody to fill his pulpit that Sunday and so I did that.
[time=772] And there again just a warm warm reception from the people of the church. It's always great to go back.
[time=778] You know that's where I got saved and that's where I spent the first 10 or 12 years of my Christian life and so a lot of folks there pray for us here for the Bible hour and for Black Hawk Baptist Church and like a great reunion.
[time=790] And I believe the Lord was at work there and that's just a vibrant church. Nearly 6,000 people there on Sunday morning and they loved to sing and worship and praise God and be minister to in the word.
[time=800] So I think I went away more and occurs anybody else.
[time=803] That's a great tribute to that ministry. I remember years ago when Dr. McCarty was beginning and there'd be maybe four or five hundred people in the chapel and then they moved to a larger auditorium and then yet another larger auditorium.
[time=814] And great ministry there for 22, 23 years like that. Well it sounds like you had a lot of work but you surely had some fun.
[time=824] Well yes, we played golf. The sun shining was out. It was 75 degrees, no clouds, not even a wisp of wind so the perfect Southern California conditions and enjoyed that with my dad and a couple of my buddies.
[time=837] That's kind of a little bit like heaven. But to be honest, maybe the most fun time, the most meaningful time that I had, even including the preaching was that I was trying to do something that I noticed the Apostle Paul doing in the book of Acts.
[time=855] And when he would minister to place, then he'd go on, you know, to another city. But he always be faithful to return to that city and strengthen some of the young believers.
[time=864] And there's a couple there named John and Judy Mailey and another couple called Doug and Melody Saddam that my wife and I had ministered to and one of the couples that come to the Lord and the other one who were still hoping will come to the Lord.
[time=875] And so we set up a lunch with the couple who were still hoping will come to the Lord and just they were so thankful. They couldn't believe, you know, that we'd come back and in the busy schedule of returning to our homeland, visit them, meant the world to them.
[time=891] I didn't realize it would mean so much. And then the couple that did come to the Lord, we had dinner with them and they were just overflowing with the things that God is doing in their life. And again, we left with a sense that it mattered a lot to them.
[time=903] And so I guess I had encouraged all of you to be thinking about those people that you've ministered to and make another deposit in their life. I think it has real reward.
[time=914] I think that's an excellent thing for you to do because people really, when there's a gap in the time frame, there's a friendship and there's a warmth that's there and an openness to share again, maybe something that you shared a number of years ago. So that's really great.
[time=929] For a number of years, the Bible Hour has been putting in reserve monies for some new equipment and we're getting very close to purchasing that new equipment.
[time=938] Russell, that's going to be an exciting time to see the quality change that will take place and also the conservation of time.
[time=945] Well, the technology, as you know in this whole industry is moving so rapidly that very high quality equipment is now dropping in price and getting within our range.
[time=955] And I'm thankful we've been saving through the years, but we are a little bit short and we're going to want to talk to you folks next week about an opportunity to help support us here with the purchase of some capital equipment.
[time=966] And I'm thankful that we don't come to you on a regular basis for the regular needs of the ministry just on some occasions for help, maybe once every six years really for some major equipment.
[time=976] And this would be that. It's great stuff. We'll look forward to talking with you about it next week.
[time=980] Yes, we have an opportunity to purchase this equipment and we're about $15,000 short of our goals, so we hope to raise that by the end of the year.
[time=988] And I encourage you to consider, personally, giving a year end gift to the Bible Hour.
[time=993] And for that gift, we want to send you the book that Jeff Carlson talked about earlier. It's called "A Christmas Longing."
[time=1000] The address will be given to you a little later and I hope you'll send us a gift today. We'd appreciate very much hearing from you.
[time=1010] For the young abandoned husband left alone without a reason for the pilgrim in the city where he lived.
[time=1031] Left alone without a reason for the pilgrim in the city where there is no home.
[time=1044] For the son without a father, for his solitary mother, I have a message.
[time=1058] He sees you. He knows you. He loves you. He loves you.
[time=1076] Every heart that is breaking tonight is the heart of a child that he holds in his sight.
[time=1094] And all he loves to hold in his arms, every heart that is breaking tonight, every heart that is breaking tonight.
[time=1120] For the precious fallen daughter, for her devastated father, for the prodigal who's dying in a strange new way.
[time=1143] For the child who's always hungry, for the patron with no country, I have a message.
[time=1157] He sees you. He knows you. He loves you. Jesus loves you.
[time=1175] Every heart that is breaking tonight is the heart of a child that he holds in his sight.
[time=1193] And all he loves to hold in his arms, every heart that is breaking tonight, every heart that is breaking tonight.
[time=1222] Every heart that is breaking tonight.
[time=1252] Thank you for being here this morning. It's always a privilege to be able to talk about God's Word and share some of the truths from it.
[time=1270] And I just hope you'll excuse some of the limitations of my voice this morning. I've been fighting that thing that some of you have been fighting lately too and it's gotten the best of me at times but I think I'm winning out and hopefully we'll do okay today.
[time=1284] This morning I want to share with you a story.
[time=1290] Go something like this. Once upon a time in a land far away lived a king who had no wife.
[time=1300] And so this king issued a royal decree to search the entire kingdom for a bride for a woman worthy to be queen and the most beautiful women from every city were sent to appear before him.
[time=1312] Each hoping that she might please the king enough to be chosen but for more than a year there was no one found who could win his heart.
[time=1322] Now during this time there came a young girl into the king's city. She was a foreigner and a common girl an orphan who'd been raised by a kind uncle.
[time=1331] But one of the king's servants was taken by her beauty in charm and he made arrangements for the girl to be cleaned and given the best beauty treatments available and for 12 months he prepared her for the day when she might meet the king.
[time=1344] And finally when all the preparations were completed the servants sent her to meet the king and the king loved her more than any other woman.
[time=1353] Immediately declared a holiday, had a great banquet given and gave out extravagant gifts to the people around him. He took this girl, his new found bride placed upon her head the royal crown and so she became the king.
[time=1368] A fairy tale? No, it's the story of a common girl who became queen actually happened but you've only heard part of the story. We can find the rest of it in a book which bears her name the book of Esther.
[time=1381] And if you have your Bibles would you turn there please if you're not sure where to find it? Well Psalms is kind of in the middle of everything turned back to books and you'll find the book of Esther.
[time=1391] I realize that some of you in the course of the last year have taken opportunity in your Bible studies your ABF to study this book. So some of the things that we have to say will be familiar to us and to you but yeah I think maybe some God has some new things that he'd like us to be reminded of or to teach us today.
[time=1411] Let me open with prayer. God it is good it's a privilege to be able to take this book and open it up and read it. It means nothing to us unless we hear the truth and your spirit takes it and pushes it into our hearts in a way that's going to make a difference in us.
[time=1427] So I pray that you will accomplish that not by my great words but by the power of your spirit and the truth of your word God so that your name is honored this morning.
[time=1436] Pray in Christ name. Amen. Now let's just look and see some of the details of how Esther rose to this place of becoming Queen chapter 1 verse 1. Now it took place in the days of a hasurus, the hasurus who reign from India to Ethiopia over 127 provinces.
[time=1457] In those days as king hasurus sat in his royal throne which was in the soos of the capital. I'll just stop right there. Some of your Bibles may give the title of Xerxes which is the Greek form of this king of Persia.
[time=1471] Some of the things that we know about this king he was a king approximately 486 BC is when we see this taking place.
[time=1483] Outside historical resources tell us some other things about this king that are shown to be true in the book of Esther but outside resources confirm that he was a king a Persian king who continued to accumulate great wealth as did the Persian kings known for their extravagant wealth.
[time=1500] He also known that he liked women kept a large harem and that he was known for throwing great parties with playing to drink and king a hasurus is also known for one who sometimes had flares of temper and lost his temper and was sometimes do irrational things because of that.
[time=1518] Persia was the world power of this time having defeated the Babylonians about 85 years earlier and under the Persian kings the Jews who had been taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar and other Babylonian kings.
[time=1529] Those Jews those exiles were given permission to return to Jerusalem and many of the Jews had already returned by this time but most of them stayed in some areas of the provinces of Persia most of the Jews remained.
[time=1544] And so that is the context in which we find this book continuing verse three it says in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and attendants the army officers the Persia and media the nobles and the princes of his provinces being in his presence and he displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his great majesty for many days 180 days.
[time=1569] I mean the king through a six month celebration a kind of world fair where all the nobles and the important people of the Persian realm were invited to come in and to look at all his wealth and the splendor of his kingdom.
[time=1583] And so they did that for six months and then the six month celebration was followed by another party verse five it says when these days were completed the king gave a banquet lasting seven days for all the people who were present in Susa the capital.
[time=1600] Another party a six day celebration I mean seven day celebration and it tells us as we read the description of this party that was kind of an open bar affair in other words all the people who attended attended instructions were given listen whatever they want to drink whenever they want to drink however much they want to drink.
[time=1618] Give it to them and so for seven days you see this party going on and it also tells us that the queen during the same time queen Vashdy was having her own banquet for the women in a separate place.
[time=1634] Well at the end of the seven days you can imagine what state these men were in in verse 10 says in the seventh day when the heart of the king was Mary with wine which is a biblical euphemism to say he was three sheets to the wind.
[time=1649] I mean if the king the king could have gotten in his royal chariot and driven down the streets of Persia been pulled over by the Persian police does no doubt he would not have passed the breathalyzer.
[time=1658] He was wasted says he was Mary with much wine and that caused him to consider something that he decided would be good to do.
[time=1667] In his best of drunken spirit he sent seven of his attendants to cofetch the queen now maybe in his mind it just seemed appropriate and fitting that at the end of six months of showing off all his wealth and all the beauty of his kingdom.
[time=1680] Why not at the end of all the celebration he show his most prized possession we're told that queen Vashdy was beautiful so he sends seven attendants to go fetch the queen.
[time=1690] The message comes to the queen the king wants you to come and show off your beauty to all the all of his friends the queen refuses.
[time=1697] She doesn't think that's such a hot idea so she refuses to come when the message comes back to the king says you know the king says she won't appear says the queen the king was furious.
[time=1708] He was so angry he got his counselors around him and said what am I to do the king has not obeyed this the queen has not obeyed the summons of the king tell me what should I do and so his counselors advised him.
[time=1718] Now they were a little bit concerned because of the ramifications of the queen refusing the king I mean if the queen can do this what's it going to mean for our wives they saw the seeds of a feminist movement being sewn and they didn't like what it might produce.
[time=1731] They told the king the king you better nip this in the butter else were in for some trouble said you need to get rid of king of queen Vashdy and you need to get another queen and you also need to make a law that women must obey their husbands and so in verse 21 it says and this word please the king the princes of course doesn't tell us what the women thought of this but the king thought that's a good idea the princess thought that's a good idea so the king issued a decree verse 22.
[time=1759] So we sent letters to all the king's provinces to each province according to its script and to every people according to their language that every man should be the master of his own house.
[time=1770] Well sometime later as we come into chapter 2 the king.
[time=1777] Besides this time to find a replacement for queen Vashdy. So he sends officials throughout the kingdom with orders to bring back to the capital city every young beautiful virgin a command I would guess not too popular among the Persian bachelors at that time but that was the command of the king every young beautiful virgin was brought back to the capital.
[time=1799] Esther were told was young and beautiful she was a Jew who at some time earlier when she was young her parents had died and she was raised by her uncle Mordecai.
[time=1811] She was taken to the capital where she was noticed by the servant in charge of all the potential queens.
[time=1817] She was given the best room and the best food and seven of the kings the seven maids from the king's palace to wait on her and were told that along with all the other potential queens she's given 12 months of beauty treatments I mean I mean this is fine living extravagant living.
[time=1835] Lifestyles of the rich and famous Esther was enjoying all of that. And when it came time for her to meet the queen I mean you can almost get the picture as she walks into the presence of the queen there's little bird parks off the sides singing here she comes miss Persia because of all the women he loved Esther and Esther was chosen to be queen.
[time=1863] Now Esther at this point chosen be queen has been set in place to be used by God and by God's design she will become the heroine of the Jews as we see later in the book.
[time=1873] But we need to understand some things about Esther because if we're not careful we read the story like a fairy tale and we look at Esther as being some kind of virtuous perfect woman like Cinderella snow white.
[time=1886] And that's hard for us because we know I could never be like that of course God used her she was so perfect but when we look at the reality of Esther we see that this is a woman with some faults the heart of this soon to be heroine was less than virtuous just because she was used by God just because she appears in the Bible doesn't mean that she was a godly woman in fact when we look at the heart of this heroine we see some glaring faults and I just like to point out a few of them.
[time=1915] First of all Esther kept her Jewishness a secret. And for her that meant not just hiding her nationality but hiding her religion whatever faith she may have had she kept it to herself she kept it a secret.
[time=1933] Now more to Cai had told her to do this we don't know the reason why for sure but during that year more than a year no one knew of Esther's faith no one knew that she was a Jew.
[time=1948] The second problem I have the second fault I see in Esther is that Esther demonstrated that she demonstrated a disregard for God's dietary laws by eating the finest foods of Persia.
[time=1958] I mean by every indication Esther fit right into the foreign culture even when it violated God's standards for the Jews.
[time=1964] You contrast this to the story of Daniel and Shadrach Meshach and Abednego occurring 150 years earlier when they were taken captive in a story that has a lot of similarities and yet they stood and said despite the fact that you want us to get want to give us the best food we refuse to do it because it violates God's commands God's expectations for us and so they stood with integrity.
[time=1985] Esther didn't do that she kind of went with the flow. Another thing about Esther in this whole book is she never mentions God never once again in contrast to Daniel who is constantly giving credit and God has due.
[time=1998] Esther never mentions the name of God in fact Esther is the only book of the Bible where the word where the name of God is never once mentioned.
[time=2007] And Esther is apparently willing perhaps even eager to please the king even though it requires tremendous compromise.
[time=2016] Now you have to understand how the queen was chosen and you've heard some of the story but it wasn't as though these women were brought before the king and they stood and they had a little interview and you know filled out a form and then at the end of it all he thought through the process and picked one of them.
[time=2032] No the procedure was they came went through 12 months of preparations and then they were sent from the harem to spend the night with the king and then when the king was finished with them they go back to a different place in the harem because they've already been with the king they become one of his concubines and if he was pleased with them they may get called to come visit him again.
[time=2051] Esther went and slept with a man to whom she wasn't married which was a direct violation of what God had called them to do.
[time=2061] And apparently without any struggle apparently even willing to participate and be involved maybe with some eagerness to be queen who knows.
[time=2070] And beyond that the compromise involved at the point that she was chosen king violated another one of God's expectations and that is that God commanded his children to not be married to the Gentiles.
[time=2082] To not marry outside the faith and yet again Esther allows it to happen with no no challenge to what was going on.
[time=2094] One last thing that I notice about Esther that I think is a fault is that when the Jews were threatened with annihilation Esther seems to be more concerned about saving herself and saving her people.
[time=2105] Now just a little bit of quick background here and we don't have time to spend a lot but I encourage if you haven't read the book of Esther just you need to sit down and just read it through in one sitting there's so much good stuff here.
[time=2116] One of the things that's that's fun to read is the character of Hayman and I wish we could spend more times we get a lot of last out of this guy.
[time=2122] Hayman was second in command of the king but he's one of the biggest losers ever to exist and when you get to the end of the book you just see how this guy lost over and over again it's comical.
[time=2132] But Hayman second in command he was wealthy he was greedy he was self-serving he was seething with pride.
[time=2140] And what angered Hayman perhaps more than anything else is when there was someone who would not give him the attention he felt he was due.
[time=2148] And coming out of the king's gate everyone would bow before the great Hayman except for one man that was Mordecai Esther's uncle.
[time=2155] And we don't know why Mordecai didn't bow. It wasn't required that Jews you know not give honor to those in authority.
[time=2163] It wasn't the same thing as the refusal of Daniel and his friends to bow before Nebuchadnezzar or the image as a god.
[time=2170] But for some reason Mordecai would not bow down and it infuriated Hayman.
[time=2176] When Hayman found out that Mordecai was a Jew his anger went so far that he plotted to not only kill Mordecai but to wipe out all the Jews.
[time=2184] And so he devised a scheme where he went to the king and laid out his argument in such a way that the king signed a law stating that it's such a time all the Jews would be killed.
[time=2198] I'm Mordecai informed Esther of this plan and says to Esther, Esther you've got to do something. You're the queen. You've got to save your people and look at Esther's response in chapter 4 verse 11.
[time=2213] She said all the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king to the inner court who is not summoned he has but one law that he be put to death.
[time=2226] Unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these 30 days.
[time=2233] Esther said you know you know the law. Nobody can approach the king unless the king calls them.
[time=2241] And the law is that if you approach the king the penalty for breaking that law is death.
[time=2246] And the only exception is that the king somehow should have favor and hold out his scepter and then you're pardoned but listen, we know the anger of this king.
[time=2253] Remember what he did to Vashti and I haven't been summoned for 30 days to see him. I don't know what frame of mind he's in. If I do this I'll die.
[time=2266] But you know what despite all these faults somehow as we read on something changes and Esther who seemed to float along the stream of personal confidence and success we see her now standing against the current to defend the lives of her people.
[time=2281] Esther and chapters 5 through 9 becomes a heroine and I asked the question what brought about those changes.
[time=2289] I think we have a glimpse into the turning of Esther's heart in chapter 4 verses 13 through 16.
[time=2296] And I think there are five truths in these verses which can help us become men and women boys and girls who have significant impact in our own world.
[time=2305] I don't know if any one of us will ever be celebrated as a hero or a heroine but I do know this that your life and my life will have a greater impact when each decision is governed by these five truths.
[time=2318] So let's look at them. Chapter 4 beginning with verse 13.
[time=2325] Then Mordekai told them to reply to Esther, "Do not imagine that you and the king's palace can escape any more than all the Jews.
[time=2332] "For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place and you and your father's house will perish."
[time=2339] The first truth is this, "Every decision you face will result in a choice which will cause an effect."
[time=2348] "Every decision you face will result in a choice which will cause an effect." I mean, in other words, you cannot not decide. Esther wanted to say, "Well, I don't want to do anything."
[time=2359] And Mordekai pointed out, "You do nothing. That's a choice. It's going to have consequences." You cannot not decide. Now some may say, "Well, you know Tim, you can't come to decisions where you don't have to choose anything. You can choose to do nothing."
[time=2372] If I'm driving down a road and I come to a stop, I come to a dead end and there's a road going right and there's a road going left.
[time=2381] And those are my two choices. I can choose to do neither. I can just sit there. I don't have to make a choice. Well, yes, you do.
[time=2387] I mean, you make the choice not to turn right or left. And that choice will have its effect. It may be a traffic jam you cause.
[time=2393] Or if there's no traffic around, it may be a pile of rust and dust eventually because you just keep sitting there.
[time=2398] But every decision will result in a choice which will cause an effect.
[time=2405] I had a good friend of mine a number of years ago who one day discovered a lump and her breast.
[time=2414] And in her decision, she decided not to choose to do nothing.
[time=2420] And her decision resulted in a choice that choices to do nothing which had an effect of a year later, her dying.
[time=2429] You cannot not decide.
[time=2432] And when confronted with the challenge to take a step of obedience to God, your choice to do nothing will have some effect.
[time=2440] It will. You can't help it.
[time=2444] Every decision faced will result in a choice which will cause an effect.
[time=2448] Another truth in this out of the same passage is this, God's sovereign plan does not depend on your success.
[time=2456] See what Mordecai says in verse 14, it says, "If you remain silent at this time, if you choose to do nothing, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place."
[time=2465] God's sovereign plan doesn't depend on your success. Now for some people say, "Well, that's just an excuse not to do anything."
[time=2471] But no, I mean, for us as Christians, that should be a hope and a comfort.
[time=2475] You see, the Bible is filled with stories of God's people with failures. Adam, Eve, Abraham, Moses, Samson, David, Esther, the Apostles, all of them failed some of them significantly.
[time=2485] And yet, God has always been able to accomplish His purposes despite their inadequacies, despite their sins, despite their failures.
[time=2494] This truth should free us from the fear of failure. Some people, I think, when it comes to decisions, they're afraid to take a step of obedience because they're, "Well, what if I mess up? What if I fail?"
[time=2506] I know God wants me to share my faith with somebody. What if I say it wrong? They know what I love.
[time=2512] Still, they never make a choice. They never make a decision. You know, your failure isn't going to thwart God's sovereign plan.
[time=2518] It doesn't depend on your success. God doesn't need your success. He simply wants your obedience, obedience.
[time=2530] Third truth. And God's design, your most significant contribution, may be this one act of obedience.
[time=2549] I like what Mordecai says at the end of verse 14, he says to Esther, "Who knows whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?"
[time=2560] Mordecai says, "I don't know this for sure, but Esther, maybe you're where you are and you're who you are because God wants to use you in this very time."
[time=2569] And this could be the most significant thing that you can accomplish in God's design.
[time=2576] Your life's most significant contribution may be this one act of obedience. And you know what? It may not even seem like that big of a deal.
[time=2583] It may not seem like a big decision, but in the scope of God's plan, in the scope of eternity in His kingdom, that act of obedience may have the greatest effect.
[time=2593] I wonder if we could ask Ed Kimball. Ed Kimball was a skinny, gray-haired man, a Sunday school teacher.
[time=2600] If we could have gone in his later years, we could ask Ed, what has been your greatest contribution in life?
[time=2608] What's been your most significant contribution to God's kingdom in his work?
[time=2614] I don't know what Ed Kimball would have said. I mean, I don't know enough about his life, but he may have thought about his years of teaching Sunday school and thought, you know, I mean, I've been faithful.
[time=2622] Maybe that's been my most significant contribution. Maybe he had children. He would say, you know what? I was faithful in raising my children. That's been my most significant contribution.
[time=2630] Maybe he could think of one event, one big thing he did. Maybe he spent, he went on a mission's trip. And he said, I think that was my most significant contribution.
[time=2638] But you know what? I doubt Ed Kimball knew that on a day when he stepped into a shoe store that he was about to make his most significant contribution in God's design and God's plan for the sake of God's kingdom.
[time=2651] Because Ed Kimball stepped into a shoe store and he talked about Jesus to a young man who was working there. And that man gave his life to Christ.
[time=2660] His name was Dwight Moody. In the late 1800s, we know the story of how God used Dwight Moody to reach the lives of hundreds and thousands, hundreds of thousands of people, some say millions who came to Christ through his ministry.
[time=2673] And so many other things he did, including the establishing of a school that still stands today as one of the great institutions of Christian education, Moody Bible Institute.
[time=2684] And that one step, active obedience, Ed Kimball didn't know. He's just talking to a kid that had been in the Sunday school class, a troublemaker. And yet he was obedient. And probably that one act in his life had most significant from God's design.
[time=2697] Now I'm not trying to say that there's only one thing that you're created for and that's the only thing that's important. Every act of obedience is important.
[time=2704] But I'm just saying who knows but that the one thing God is telling you to do right now may be the most significant thing he wants to accomplish in your life.
[time=2714] We don't know.
[time=2717] Tell you something else that this truth causes me to think about. Some people give the false argument. You know what? I've blown any chance I've had to do anything significant for God.
[time=2728] I've messed up. I failed. I've sinned. God can't use me. I want you to know something. Your past failures don't determine your usefulness to God.
[time=2738] See, here's the truth that's central to the gospel. God's grace is greater than your sin. God's grace is greater than your sin.
[time=2750] Now listen. I want you to understand me. If Esther had been obedient to God, if Esther's life had been a pattern of obedience to God, she would never have been queen.
[time=2765] Now God would have found another way to deliver his people because he's faithful to his promise. He would have done it, but if God had been obedient, if Esther had been obedient to God, she would have never been queen.
[time=2774] What am I saying? That it's good that she was disobedient? No. What I'm saying is this is a perfect example of how God's grace comes into a play, even to a life that's filled with faults, disobedient, and yet how God in His grace can even still use a woman like Esther.
[time=2791] It's not an excuse to sin, but it's a praise for God's wonderful grace. Now this idea that somehow some people think that they have to accept God's second best in their life.
[time=2800] I hear people talk about that. There's one time, God, I know God was calling me to do this or to be this, but I disobeyed.
[time=2809] And now somehow I'm confined to the lower shelf. Now I've got to live my existence out, hoping God may do something, but I've lost any ability to be really a significant use to God. That's fooey. That's not the gospel.
[time=2823] That takes the power of God's grace right out. Yes, sin has consequence. Yes, sin brings judgment. Sometimes we bear the scars and consequences of our sin for the rest of our life, but God can reach into a broken, messed up life, and out of that in His sovereignty by His grace can do something even more remarkable when our hearts are turned and repentance and obedience to Him.
[time=2847] That's the work of God. That's the message of the gospel. That's the power of the cross. That's what Jesus Christ did.
[time=2859] You're most significant contribution. Whether you think that you made a wrong decision, maybe you think you, you know, in the wrong marriage, maybe you think you're in the wrong vocation, somehow you made those decisions back there that you look back and say I didn't do it right.
[time=2874] Well, where you are now, if you have a heart that turns to God and obedience, God can accomplish great significant things through your life, perhaps the most significant things that He has ever accomplished through your life.
[time=2886] If you'll just have a heart of obedience to Him. There's a fourth truth. And it's this, before you act, you must pray.
[time=2898] Verse 15, in the beginning of 16, says, "Then Esther told them to reply to Mordecai. Give him this message.
[time=2905] "Go assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day.
[time=2913] I and my maidens will also fast in the same way, and thus I will go into the king."
[time=2922] Esther says, "Let's get ready. I'll do it." Before I act, let's prepare ourselves.
[time=2929] And before you act, you must pray. Someone once said that a day without prayer is a boast against God. I think there's truth in that.
[time=2935] We go through our decisions in our life without a heart of prayer to God. We are just saying, "God, I really, you know, I say I need you, but I can do this on my own.
[time=2943] "I can handle this myself, but prayer demonstrates our dependence on God, our need for God, our plugging in to His power and His resources in our life."
[time=2955] Jesus modeled the need for prayer in His own life. I mean, before choosing the 12 apostles, Bible tells us in Luke, it says that Jesus spent the night praying to God.
[time=2965] And when warning came, He called His disciples to Him and shows 12 of them whom He called apostles. Jesus knew the importance of prayer.
[time=2972] I'd suggest to you, if Jesus knew the importance of that kind of prayer, it may be important for me, may be important to you.
[time=2979] Before you act, you must pray. Philippians 4, 6, don't be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, present your request to God in everything.
[time=2991] Before you act, you must pray. And finally, the last truth is this. You must take the risk to do what's right.
[time=3000] I mean, in the decisions you make, do you want a life that is going to impact in your world? Well, here are five things you have to give attention to.
[time=3006] In this last, you must take the risk to do what's right. Esther said the last part of verse 16, "And thus I will go to the king, which is against the law, and if I die, I die."
[time=3021] We look in the Bible, the people of faith is recorded in Hebrews chapter 12, "People of faith in God's Word were people who were willing to take a risk." That's what trusting God is all about.
[time=3030] "Willing to take a risk to do what's right." Noah risked his future. Abraham risked his son. Moses risked a death penalty. Gideon risked his comfort.
[time=3040] David risked a giant's fury. Esther risked her life to do what was right. And I really believe this, when you stop risking, when you stop taking risk,
[time=3050] then you stop trusting God. Because you can't play it safe and trust God at the same time. There's no need to trust God when our life is safe and secure.
[time=3060] Trusting God having faith in Him is meaning we're willing to step out, even when the circumstances are saying, "Whoa, whoa, there's danger here, being willing to trust God."
[time=3072] Imagine if you can, a tribe of desert people somewhere in Africa. And this tribe of people has never seen the ocean. They've never seen a body of water.
[time=3084] Their existence has been around whatever well can be dug, wherever water can be found. And they dig deep and find water. And as long as the well-provided water, that's where they would live. And when the well went dry, they'd moved to another place and dig.
[time=3096] And that's how they would exist. And imagine that I'm able to come into this tribe. With all my 20th century 1990 knowledge and technology and abilities, and into this tribe, I dig a great hole.
[time=3110] I excavate and I pour. And I put into this hole, I fill it with a form of a pool. And I call the trucks in with the great tanks on them. And these trucks come in and they fill this pool with water. And these people, these desert tribesmen are standing around.
[time=3125] They've never seen anything like this before. And you can imagine some of their reactions, some of them may be very superstitious and fearful and curse and say, "Get this. This has no place in life. This is not normal. This is not natural." And they may run away. Others may be curious.
[time=3139] And step up and want a closer look. There may be some who touch the water. And I'm inside the pool now. I'm the one who created the pool and made the pool and made it for them. And I want them to enjoy it. And I say, "Come in."
[time=3150] I mean, I just want you to experience, this is great. The water is fine. And some of them, perhaps maybe, convince to step into the water. And I can see them on the shallow end holding onto the side because they're still fearful.
[time=3163] And I entice them, I beg them, I said, "Come on, trust me. Let go of the side. I'll hold onto. I won't let you sink. I want to teach you how to swim. And maybe a few of them would let go of the side and come out. And we'd learn the swim and splash in the deep end and we'd enjoy what a pool is meant to be."
[time=3177] You know, that's kind of the picture of what God has done for us. In our, the deserts of our life, God has come in and he said, "You know, I've created you for something more."
[time=3185] I craved you to have life abundantly. And yet, some people are afraid. Some people are curious. Some step into God's invitation and give their life to what God has called them to do.
[time=3197] But yet, even many of us who are in the pool, we still live lives of fearfulness. We want to play it safe. We want to hold onto the side and God wants us to trust Him and take a risk to step away from the side.
[time=3210] And some of you need to take the risk to let go of the side. Trust God enough. And when you do that, you begin to realize what God has really created you to experience. Begin to experience life abundantly.
[time=3226] Once upon a time, there was a girl whose name was Esther. She was a less than perfect woman who became a heroine because she changed to make the right choice, the right decision.
[time=3237] I mean, how does your story go? How is your story going to end? How will you have an impact on your world?
[time=3247] It may be that God is calling some of you to make a decision today. Perhaps some of you, you've known that there's a decision you're supposed to have been making for a long while and you've just been putting it off for whatever reason.
[time=3258] Maybe it seems a big decision. Maybe it seems insignificant and small. But if God is asking you to do something, you must obey.
[time=3268] That's pray. God, I thank you for the life and example of Esther because it encourages me. Despite my failures and my inadequacies, God, when I do what's right and faithful and obedient to you, God, you can still use me.
[time=3288] I just pray for each of us here, God, that however you're working in our hearts, whatever you are calling us to do, that we would have the kind of response that makes a difference in our world for your name's sake.
[time=3300] I pray it in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3311] During the message, Tim said that God's grace is greater than all our sins. He said a number of other significant things too.
[time=3318] I also know that God's love is much greater. God's love for us is much greater than our love for Him. He really desires for you to know Him in a personal way.
[time=3327] Maybe today you've never accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior and you'd like to begin that walk with Him.
[time=3332] Or you're here today and you've never been baptized. You've never joined the church and you want to identify with this body of believers. We have an invitation at the end of our service.
[time=3341] While we're singing, if you'd like to come and join Tim down here and tell him of your need, we'd love to have you come.
[time=3347] We're going to sing together him number 368. Let's stand, please, as we sing.
[time=3362] All for Jesus, all for Jesus. All my need that's love. All my thoughts and words and new wings. All my days and all my love.
[time=3385] All for Jesus, all my days and all my love. All for Jesus, all my days and all my love.
[time=3415] It's customary at the end of our service to invite people to ask Jesus Christ into their hearts. This before we close the Bible hour today, if you need to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior, I'd like to pray this prayer with you. Let's bow together.
[time=3433] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I've sinned against you. I ask for your forgiveness. I ask you to come into my heart today and be my Savior.
[time=3444] In Jesus name I pray, amen. If you prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us in the nature of your decision.
[time=3452] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance that'll help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
