[time=11] Therefore, my beloved brethren, whom I long to see, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved.

[time=32] Welcome to The Bible Lower, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship,
[time=38] which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=42] Thank you for joining us.
[time=44] Peer pressure isn't just for kids, even as adults.
[time=47] We can feel pressure to compromise our Christian values.
[time=52] We've been called to walk the delicate line between being in the world, but not of the world.
[time=58] We're constantly exposed to the world's values.
[time=61] Regularly, we come in contact with a strong, persuasive culture of our day that calls people to live for themselves.
[time=69] How do we stand against the onslaught of ungodly influences in our resolve to live for Christ?
[time=75] Well, stay with us today as we learn from God's Word, the secret of standing firm.
[time=80] Our special music today will be provided by Kings Kids, one of our children's choirs.
[time=86] [MUSIC]
[time=89] Let's join them as we begin our service.
[time=91] [MUSIC]
[time=101] That Christmas there are presents underneath the tree.
[time=108] The trinkers playing and the drunkers playing.
[time=113] [MUSIC]
[time=115] There's a gift that you cannot see.
[time=118] Oh, the best, President of all is Jesus.
[time=131] It's the best, President of all is the one that came to me.
[time=138] The best, President of all is God's Son.
[time=145] Underneath the mistletoe, Grandma gives me a kiss.
[time=152] So I give her a gift I made myself, and I give it with a...
[time=159] In your best, President of all is Jesus.
[time=172] In your best, President of all is the one that came to you.
[time=179] In your best, President of all is God's Son.
[time=186] So I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
[time=192] But most of all, I wish for you that Jesus could be here.
[time=199] Oh, baby, in a manger, 2,000 years ago.
[time=205] But the greatest gift that we will ever know.
[time=211] In your best, President of all is Jesus.
[time=225] In your best, President of all is the one that came to you.
[time=231] In your best, President of all is Jesus.
[time=268] [MUSIC] And take us to heaven to live with thee there.
[time=382] [MUSIC]
[time=398] Well, hello there and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=403] It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas all over town and I hope you're as excited about the Christmas season as I am.
[time=408] Well, for a number of weeks we've been letting you know we want to talk to you about some of the financial needs of our ministry.
[time=415] And we'd like to do that even today.
[time=419] For the most part, the financial needs of the Bible Hour are met by a group of people called the Founders Club.
[time=424] They come to our ministry and support it on a monthly basis and they underwrite all the regular needs of our ministry.
[time=429] In fact, at the end of each year it's not uncommon for us to have a couple of thousand dollars left over.
[time=436] And we'll set that aside in a special account for replacing capital equipment when that need comes along.
[time=441] And so in general our ministry is strong and it's being financially supported by these folks and we're thankful for that because it means we don't have to come to you on a regular weekly basis asking you to give money.
[time=452] We can just present this ministry free of charge.
[time=455] However, there are sometimes in the life of our ministry when we do need to ask your help financially.
[time=460] And typically that'll occur when we're trying to buy new capital equipment, new cameras or new editing machines.
[time=466] And that's what we're needing even right now.
[time=470] In fact, the editing equipment that we need to replace is about ten years old.
[time=475] The technicians tell us that on a regular basis, as often as once a week, our tape machines will break and they'll have to fix them.
[time=483] And they don't mind doing that, but they want us to know that sooner or later the equipment will be on repair.
[time=489] And the Bible Hour won't be broadcast that week or for another week until it's had to go out for special technical repair.
[time=496] And it's just moving beyond its lifespan.
[time=499] We've had our eye on some new equipment that's new on the market that would take us to a whole new level in technology and allow us to pursue a level of excellence we haven't been able to pursue even today.
[time=508] Let me show you a picture of this new equipment. It's called Media 100 and it's a non-linear editing system.
[time=514] What that means is that the picture will go directly from the camera into the computer that you're seeing and it won't involve a tape machine.
[time=521] It won't involve that kind of complicated process. The computer will allow us to edit the whole program right there on the computer and then put it under a tape where it can be sent to the television broadcasting station.
[time=534] We wanted to buy this for some time, but when technology is new, the cost is very high.
[time=539] And yet, if we've waited as we have, typically the cost will drop and that's exactly what's happened. So we've been waiting for the cost to drop and we've continued to save money.
[time=548] Let me show you a little graph that shows how effectively we've been able to save some money.
[time=553] You'll notice that the Bible Hour savings through the last number of years has risen now to where we have $21,000 in the bank.
[time=560] We also presented our need to the volunteer staff of the Bible Hour television ministry and they've donated some $3,000. And then we've had an individual donor give us $17,000.
[time=571] Well, that comes to a grand total of $41,000. We're excited about that. The equipment that we need is $56,000.
[time=580] And so if you subtract that, you'll find that we end up with a remaining need of $15,000. And we're coming to you as viewers of the Bible Hour to help us meet that $15,000 need.
[time=593] So what I'm asking you this morning is to consider giving towards at $15,000. Maybe you could write us a check for $1,000 or for $500 or $100 as you anticipate your year in giving.
[time=606] We desperately need that help and now is a time that we would like for you to contribute to our ministry.
[time=611] If you could, mail your contribution to us at the Bible Hour, $7,400, East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. That's $7,400, East State Boulevard, 46815, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=629] We are thankful that other people typically underwrite this ministry on a regular basis. And so it's only occasionally that we have to come and ask for your help.
[time=638] But we are doing that even today and we would appreciate your help.
[time=643] We know through the correspondence we receive from people that people are coming to know the Lord through the Bible Hour and they're being encouraged.
[time=649] Many shut-ins can't come to church and they receive their encouragement through us.
[time=653] And we'd love for you to help us with that. Thank you very much for considering our need.
[time=668] [MUSIC]
[time=678] Who's the star we've seen in these Bethlehem town? You're not the beast. Who sings that song of love and delight?
[time=691] Angels and heaven souls fill up the night. For it's too light in the highest. He's on the earth in the will to end.
[time=705] Who's the child, this baby boy? Who's the star we've seen in these Bethlehem? You're so much joy. But it's in faith, this land we sing.
[time=720] Jesus the Christ, the King of the Ring. For it's too light in the highest. He's on the earth in the will to end.
[time=734] What's my gift? What's my gift? What's a gift that is gift for a King? How did my life not just a part? I'll give my all to him, I'll give my heart.
[time=753] I'll give my all to him, I'll give my all to him, I'll give my heart.

[time=866] Our special gift this month is the beautiful book by Johnny Ericksen Tata, a Christmas longing. In it Johnny writes a beautiful account of Christmas with all its joy and splendor. She's also illustrated this entire book with many full color pictures.
[time=882] If you would like one of these books for yourself or for a friend, the Bible Hour is offering them to you for a gift of $25 or more. Please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=896] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bibles and come with me to Philippians chapter 3 as we continue our study of this book of the Bible. And as I think you know, all the words in the Bible are inspired by God.
[time=914] The chapter breaks and actually even the verses are not. Those were added by people later. And it's not bad that we have those. They are very helpful as we seek to be able to locate particular portions of Scripture.
[time=928] But they are not divine. They are not written by the original author. They are not inspired. And so they do not always represent necessarily the flow of any given text.
[time=938] And I say to you this morning to say this, the passage we have is starting in Philippians 3 verse 17 and it will go all the way down through chapter 4 verse 1.
[time=950] And in fact, in my opinion, that is the better place to break the chapter. Chapter 4 in my mind should begin at verse 2 not verse 1 because in verse 1, you have the key to understanding this entire passage.
[time=962] Let me read it for you, chapter 4 verse 1. "Therefore, my beloved brethren, whom I long to see, my joy and crown, so stand firm in the Lord, my beloved."
[time=974] That therefore is indicating what I have said to you comes to this. What it adds up to in your life is that you are able to stand firm for the things of Christ.
[time=985] Christianity, basically, throughout all the centuries, has been a minority group. We have been the folks who have been outnumbered by the greater dominant culture.
[time=997] And that greater dominant culture has always held views and values and priorities, which are different than ours.
[time=1005] Because we take our cue from the word of God and the dominant culture has been given to the prince of the power of the air, Satan, who is the temporary monarch of this world system.
[time=1015] And so he works hard and long to set up his religious and false religious system and his atheistic systems all around the world.
[time=1023] And we, as Christians, little minority groups scattered all around the world, find ourselves in host cultures that are hostile to our Christian beliefs and to our values.
[time=1033] And so from the time of the writing of this letter until this day, there is the need for the injunction for us to stand firm in the Lord.
[time=1041] For us not to compromise our Christian values and our Christian beliefs, even though we are, as it were, in the world, but not of it, and that is a difficult line to walk.
[time=1052] It would have been so much easier if we would just come to Christ, accept Him as our Lord and Savior, and like Enoch, be no more. Just ascend into glory.
[time=1063] And not have to continue to live on this planet where our values are constantly being checked and questioned and resisted.
[time=1070] But that's not the way it is. He said, "I want you in the world, but not of the world. I want you to live on this planet, live in your community, know their names, dress like they dress, walk like they walk, live where they live.
[time=1081] Work where they work, buy your food where they buy their food, be in the world, but don't be of the world."
[time=1088] Which means don't take their priorities, don't take their commitments as your own.
[time=1095] And so we are faced with the difficulty of standing for the cause of Christ in a world that is hostile to the same.
[time=1102] Now another word for this, which we typically associate only with the youth, but I'll use it this morning because I think it's relevant, is peer pressure.
[time=1109] Peer pressure. And I don't think that that stops all of a sudden because you grew out of your teens, and now you're 20, 30, 40, or 50 years of age.
[time=1118] We are, all of us, confunded with this dominant culture, which is hostile to our values, and we are in situations in our workplace, in our homes, and in relationships where our values are not their values.
[time=1131] And so there can be pressure to compromise those in however subtle a manner or a way.
[time=1137] Thinking about this, I tried to remember the first time in my life that I felt peer pressure, and it was in the fourth grade.
[time=1144] My good friend, James Lip, and my other good friend, Ruben Gonzalez, we were buddies, and we had built a strong fraternity of friendship around the fact that we like to play sports together and write our bikes together and draw fast cars.
[time=1157] You know those little drawings we've been making class instead of studying, and so we just had this great thing. Well one morning I come to school and I'm out of it. I'm completely left out of the fraternity, and I don't understand why.
[time=1168] But I can remember with real clarity the feelings that I had of being ostracized, and feeling a little bit undone, and feeling unwanted, and just recognizing that at that moment was the most important thing in my life was somehow to find my way back into that little group of guys.
[time=1186] So I eventually got time to get over with them, and they allowed me to get close enough. It was like they were on their own over there, and they finally revealed to me what it was.
[time=1196] Ruben Gonzalez was a chewmash Indian there in California, and he had brought from the reservation a little bit of chewing tobacco, red man chewing tobacco, and he was chewing it, and James Lip was chewing it, and they didn't trust me to be on the inner circle of the chewing tobacco thing.
[time=1213] And it's for fear that I'd turned them in, they had left me out of the group. Well I so desperately wanted back into the group that I promised them. I would never tell a soul, and in fact insisted that they give me some.
[time=1225] And so I got sick. I'm chewing the tobacco, trying to stay in the group.
[time=1231] Long time ago, but the memory is very, very real. Why? Because the feelings that are accompanying a sense of being ostracized are so powerful and so penetrating that we don't often forget that kind of stuff.
[time=1245] Later it was the eighth grade. When everybody in the school was going to the eighth grade graduation dance, except me, because my parents had some weird rules that said I couldn't do that stuff till I was 16, and I still take issue with them on that at times when I have opportunity.
[time=1260] But you see, I couldn't escape the being different thing. I couldn't just pretend that I didn't want to go to the dance because I had a girlfriend then in the eighth grade. Her name was Lisa, and everybody knew that she was going and that I would obviously want to go. So I couldn't just say, well, I don't want to go.
[time=1280] So I was in a, between a rock and a hard place, and my only way out, so powerful were these feelings not to feel ostracized and weird and to be, to be marching to the beat of a different drummer.
[time=1289] My only option that I knew up was to just break up with Lisa. So I did. So I had no reason than to go, and so I could play at least in my mind a little masquerade of not being left out. Powerful, powerful feelings.
[time=1303] They go on in me to this day, and I suspect they go on in you because for sure they go on in the lives of the Philippians. These are adults, folks, and he's saying, stand firm. Don't compromise. Don't give in to the dominant culture. Stay true to your values in Christianity.
[time=1318] There are times when I might be traveling, and where I'll be on a plane going somewhere, and nobody knows who I am, and I'll strike up a conversation with somebody, and we'll get involved in talking about life and talking about who that person is and what they do, and they will have so strongly established their agenda that I'll confess at times I'm reluctant to want to say, yeah, I'm a preacher.
[time=1340] I'm a preacher. For a couple of reasons. Number one, I'm afraid that they will think me like those other preachers that they've heard about in the media as of late, who are nothing but a bunch of hucksters and immoral, and I don't want to be grouped with them, but in another sense I just sometimes can feel a bit of intimidation.
[time=1356] To say that I don't fit in. I don't believe what you believe. I don't ascribe to the same values that you've been talking about as you talk about your career and what you're seeking to do and how you're trying to do it.
[time=1368] However, I will confess more often than not. I try my best to show them the truth of the gospel and talk to them and reason with them about how much better it is to be saved, but I still feel those feelings, and I imagine you do too.
[time=1380] If I feel them, I'm coistered in this church seven days a week almost. You're not almost every day of the week. You find your way into real life situations with unbelievers who do not believe what you believe.
[time=1392] You work for people who do not believe what you believe. And so this wonderful truth of God's Word I hope comes to us as a point of strength.
[time=1401] What Paul is doing is he is going to give us three elements of standing strong from this passage. He's going to help you and me to be strong and not compromise to the dominant culture.
[time=1412] Three elements of standing firm and they'll come to us in verses 17 through 21. The first is found in verse 17.
[time=1420] Brethren, join in following my example and observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us.
[time=1429] The element number one is to follow positive examples.
[time=1434] He is saying over in verse 8, look at chapter 3 verse 8, "Now more than that I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things in count them but rubbish in order that I may gain Christ."
[time=1448] It is true to say that what we have found in Christ should be so valuable to us, should be so significant to us that we would suffer the loss of everything else in our life without hesitation because of this marvelous treasure that we have found in him.
[time=1462] But he knows us and he knows the frail nature of the human being and he knows that while that may be true in our hearts if we were pushed against the wall we would say Christ is more valuable to us than anything.
[time=1474] He also knows that throughout the course of day-to-day life a dominant culture can rob you of that sense and cause you to compromise.
[time=1481] And so he says, "What you need are positive examples in your life. What you need are people who are stronger than you are in your Christianity, who have walked the path a little further, who have matured a little more, you need to identify these examples and observe them."
[time=1496] It is the word in the English and the Greek, it means to fix your gaze upon them so that you can imitate their behavior. He is saying, "Make sure as a believer who is attempting to stand strong that the significant others in your life are mature believers."
[time=1511] That is it in a nutshell. He is saying, "Don't allow your boss or one of your unsafe friends or somebody outside the community of Christ. Don't let them be your significant others."
[time=1523] Don't allow their values and what is important to them and the priorities in their life to begin to set the pace in your life.
[time=1530] That leads to absolute disaster.
[time=1533] He is saying, "Fine strong, godly people in the Christian community and make them your significant others. Value what they value, follow along in their path."
[time=1544] Paul says very clearly in this verse, "Follow my example." The only reason he can say that is because he himself is in the passionate pursuit of Christ's likeness.
[time=1555] He says of the Corinthians and 1 Corinthians 11, "Be imitators of me, even as I am imitating Christ."
[time=1561] Paul is not claiming any virtue for himself that in and of himself he is worthy of emulation.
[time=1567] He is saying what is valuable about my life is that you can follow it and because I am following Christ in essence I will be a human that is showing you the path.
[time=1578] Christ became human but was also god and Christ never had to grow to maturity. Christ was always mature.
[time=1585] Christ never had to learn what it meant to struggle through a particular issue on his way to maturity. He was just always mature. He was always perfect. He was always 100% senseless.
[time=1596] Not so with Paul. Paul is on a path that you and I are on. Paul is walking from his sinful state of immaturity to a place of great maturity.
[time=1605] Here are 30 years into his Christian experience. He says, "I have been tracking the qualities of Christ like this in my life and so you can fall in line and track as I have track."
[time=1616] I will show you things about the Christian life that you need to know. What does that mean specifically? How do I follow the example of Christ?
[time=1625] I mean excuse me of Paul. Does it mean that because Paul was an intellectual person which he was, greatly schooled, brilliant mind and as you know a phenomenal writer, does that mean that I have to sit home and read really thick books and try to become educated and go back to school and become an excellent writer or communicator?
[time=1645] We also know about Paul that he was very emotional. He was a fireball. He was a very aggressive confrontive individual as a personality, probably a type A personality.
[time=1654] Does that mean for me to follow his example that I have to become like him and his personality? What does it mean for me to become Paul-like?
[time=1664] History tells us beyond the record of Scripture but history writing about Paul says he was short, had a hook nose and bad eyesight. Is that part of my process? When I grow in Christ will I somehow look like him?
[time=1678] Well come with me for a minute. Hold your finger here in Philippians and come to 2 Timothy 3. Go back about three or four books.
[time=1686] This verse really jumped out at me this week. 2 Timothy 3 verse 10 and he is talking to Timothy, someone who had been following his example.
[time=1699] But he delineates what about it in Paul that Timothy was supposed to follow? It wasn't intelligence and it wasn't a particular style of personality and it wasn't a particular physical demeanor.
[time=1712] 2 Timothy 3 verse 10 but you followed mine. Here's a list. Teaching which means my doctrine, my conduct, my holiness. He goes on to say my purpose and faith and patience and love and perseverance and persecutions and sufferings.
[time=1729] Those are the things he calls us to emulate. So we are to have the doctrine, the true doctrine which Paul taught and we are to have a holy conscientious devote behavior pattern in our conduct.
[time=1739] And our purpose should be Paul's purpose to win people to Christ and to grow them up in the nurture and the admonition of the Lord.
[time=1746] And our faith should be like his faith and our patience, our ability to endure should be like his and our ability to love people should be like his.
[time=1756] But mind you that will come in your unique package. You will be uniquely you as you seek to emulate his teaching and conduct and purpose and faith and patience.
[time=1768] It will work its way out in your life that is unique only to you and must stay unique only to you. Back to Philippians 3.
[time=1777] In the living Christmas tree this year we are really as a church featuring one of our own. Marty and Julie Collins and they are giving the testimony that we want presented for our tree.
[time=1791] And it is so uniquely them. It is what God is doing in their life and it is their application of doctrine and conduct and love and perseverance, the list that you just saw.
[time=1802] And therein is its power. If they stood up here and talked about abstract truth it would have very little power. It is because it is embodied in their personal expression of what God is doing in their life.
[time=1814] And as you probably know, Julie and Marty are rejoicing in the personal presence of Christ in their life. Julie has a diabetic becoming pregnant and through the pregnancy losing her eyesight.
[time=1828] And the very things she always wanted was a child and children and when it comes there is just a shadow of the little baby Molly and now absolute utter blackness. They say the rest of her life.
[time=1839] And she stands up here with all the boldness of Christ and with the joy that fills her heart. And she says this is what Christ is doing in my life and I embrace it and this is the path that he has given me to glorify him and I accept it.
[time=1852] To talk about how it is to be in personal, you see there is the power of the testimony. It is that these truths and these principles are being brought to bear in an individual's life who is free to be herself or himself.
[time=1864] So he doesn't say or call for us to emulate him to the point that we lose our own identity on the contrary. He wants us to be uniquely who we are but striving for principles which are consistent with Christ's lightness.
[time=1878] Notice he says in verse 17. The middle of the verse, observe those who walk according to the pattern you have in us. So he broadens the patterning. He says don't just look at me. Look at me but also look at others.
[time=1893] And there is a lot of wisdom in that. He has already presented Timothy and a paphroditus in this book as positive examples but he is saying to them look at your own church, look within your own community of believers and broaden those you pattern yourself after besides just me.
[time=1907] There is a real practical wisdom in that. Any one person has strengths and has weaknesses and in their Christian life and in their perspectives about God and in their understanding of the Word of God and in their commitment to ministry.
[time=1920] And if we are to latch to just one person then they will so completely reproduce themselves in us that we will not just mirror their strengths but their weaknesses as well.
[time=1930] And so he calls us to broaden our perspective and find not just one example but to find many who represent what it is to be a Christian so that their weaknesses can counterbalance each other by their strengths.
[time=1943] I think about that in my life and my relationship with Kelly Bird who has come here to preach and who is a pastor now in California who I disciple for eight years in a role and we were like bosom buddies through that whole experience and it got to the point where he'd pick up the phone and say hello and my wife would think it was me.
[time=1962] The complete emulation of everything and we finally got to the place where we said hey it'd be better for you to work with some other men to balance out the experience.
[time=1972] And so we're thankful that he's on staff at a church now with a pastor named Tom Givens who while Tom stands for the same teaching and the same truth and the same lifestyle, the same priorities it's uniquely Tom Givens and his staff they all are unique to themselves and so that Kelly can be blended and balanced and worked through.
[time=1990] That's the idea.
[time=1993] My mentoring comes from part John MacArthur, part Bob Provost, part Charles Smith and I'm so thankful to say that in the last two and a half years being here.
[time=2003] One of my prayers is that God would give me new mentors, new people, new examples, new significant others, new people I could look at and say now look at the qualities of that person's life and look at how mine don't match.
[time=2016] And what a joy it is that there are two or three or four of them here in this city that I'm beginning more and more to open my life to and say please impact me.
[time=2025] Give me your strengths, teach me, show me.
[time=2030] Now some of you are saying that I don't know what you're talking. I don't do that. I don't have those people in my life.
[time=2037] I would say with the Apostle Paul, get them just to be really honest. You can't live your Christian life as it is intended to be lived without these kinds of examples in your life where you are saying the significant other of my life are believers.
[time=2053] They are believers who are more mature than I. Some of you have friends who are not believers or who are nominal believers and they are your significant others and you take your cues from them and they are leading you step by step by step away from the things of Christ.
[time=2069] They are compromising your stand and Paul would say to you beware of that, reverse that trend, break sufficiently from that relationship to where they do not do that to you and put in their stead other stronger, more dedicated Christians that you can follow.
[time=2085] That's a basic principle. It's the heart of discipleship and it's the heart of the Christian message. It's part of standing firm. Secondly, he moves that in his discussion in verses 18 and 19 and look at what he says.
[time=2097] "For many walk of whom I often told you and now tell you even weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ whose end is destruction, whose God is their appetite, whose glory is their shame, whose set their minds on earthly things."
[time=2113] You see what he says at the beginning of verse 18, "For many walk." He's talking about the dominant culture. This is one of the most succinct descriptions of an unbeliever that I've found anywhere in the New Testament.
[time=2124] He's saying the reason you need to reinforce yourself with positive examples is because there's a whole host of people out there who are enemies of the cross, who are unsaved and so his second point is this. Understand the unsaved.
[time=2139] You must gain a level of insight into the people who do not love Christ and who stand at enmity with the cross so that your insight will in some measure insulate you from their damaging impact on your life.
[time=2152] past the facade of their experience. Understand the reality of what it means to be unsafe, and for
[time=2158] brief bullet statements, look at them, verse 19, number one, their end is destruction. You see,
[time=2165] they look like us, and they dress like us, and they talk like us, and they work like us, and they get sick like us, and they'll die like us. And we can become deluded to think that they are just
[time=2176] like us, and that their experience and existence is like ours, some ways it is, in fundamental ways it
[time=2182] isn't. You and I are headed for heaven. You and I are headed for the glories of eternity with the
[time=2188] person of Christ. They are headed for the opposite of that. Distitution, separation from Christ,
[time=2194] misery, suffering, loneliness, pain, that is their end, it is destruction. We are undiabolically
[time=2201] opposed paths. When I was at the Master's College, the AIDS and Modepic was breaking into full bloom.
[time=2210] And we were working hard to call our young people to sexual purity, as it is taught in the Word of
[time=2218] God, 1 Thessalonians chapter 4. And this principle came to our minds, show the end of a particular
[time=2226] path, show the end of a particular choice. And so we actually went and visited an AIDS hospice in
[time=2233] Los Angeles and did some surveys of these people, interviewed them. They allowed us to take pictures.
[time=2238] They knew what we were trying to accomplish. It wasn't that we were sneaking up on them. We brought that back into a powerful film presentation, slide presentation, to show the young people in our college what it all looks like at the end. And on the front end, it's loud music that calls for
[time=2254] sexual impurity and sexual pleasure with no consequences that are never portrayed in their music and never portrayed in their movies and never portrayed in the television shows. And when you forget the end of a particular path, it can be more enticing to you than it should. And so they had opportunity to hear the weakened voices of people whose bodies were stricken with secondary diseases
[time=2275] because their body could no longer fight. The immune system was failing and they could hear the remorse and they could hear the pain and they could see the frail little bodies of those that were
[time=2287] fading away quickly heading towards destruction. That's what he's saying. Look past the present,
[time=2293] look at their end. There is in the scripture a man who is overwhelmed by the prosperity of the
[time=2299] wicked such that he questions his own commitment to God. He's about ready to junk his relationship with
[time=2305] God until he says, "I came to the sanctuary of God, there I perceived their end, surely,
[time=2313] thou dost set them in slippery places, thou dost cast them down to destruction, how they are destroyed in a moment. They are utterly swept away by a sudden terror like a dream when one
[time=2323] awakens. Their life is like a dream. It's like a dream. It's over when the reality starts,
[time=2331] eternity. Their life remembers to them as a dream that has been swept away." Remember,
[time=2337] they're end. Secondly, he says, as he describes the condition of the many, the dominant culture,
[time=2343] verse 19, "whose God is their appetite, whose God is their appetite." That means appetite, that means eating and drinking. He said, "What they have enshrined, the divine one that is the
[time=2354] principle of what they would do and what they would not do, the basis upon which they make their decisions is their appetite, the ability to satisfy their own hunger and their own thirst physically, and then also the longings of life." They have enshrined that. That is the significant reality that they look to. Does this meet my needs? And of course, in this culture, what would have
[time=2374] been running through their minds would have been the eating habits of the Romans as they would celebrate in a binge and purge fashion where they would eat themselves to gluttony and then go some place and throw it all up so they could come back and do some more of it. And that was the pinnacle expression of their society at that time we live to satisfy ourselves. And one of the ways we can do that regularly and consistently and even in the same night over and over and over and over and over and over again is to eat ourselves to absolute gluttony and then throw it up so we can do it again.
[time=2402] Look past the facade of their life and understand the guiding God is their own. They are enslaved.
[time=2410] They're actually enslaved to their own lusts. They look free. They look free to be making their
[time=2416] choices, but they're not. They're enslaved. The third point, he lists, which has never been
[time=2422] more true, I think, than in our day, is that their glory is in their shame. What does that mean?
[time=2428] They boast in the things they should be ashamed of. They boast in and about the very things that
[time=2436] should cause them to shrink in shame. For example, in our day, we reach a level of technology which
[time=2443] allows us to probe the heavens in a way we have never been able to see or understand. And we find with
[time=2450] greater understanding, they far exceed our ability to study or even understand. They are astonishing and they are overwhelming because of the technology. And then we can go the other direction in a microbiology and see and understand things that we could never here to foreknow and see the order
[time=2466] and see the structure and see the wonder and see the grandeur and it all adds up to a greater affirmation that it all evolved. You see? They take all this new information that they can gather
[time=2476] in our generation and they boast about their information and they boast that it leads further
[time=2482] to the hypothesis that all the structure and all the wisdom and all the design and all the brilliance and all the wonder of it all tells us time plus chance. That ought to bring them to a place of
[time=2492] absolute shame. It doesn't. They glory in it. That's how lost they are. That's how blind they are.
[time=2497] That's how far removed they are from the truth. And then lastly, they set their minds on earthly
[time=2503] things. Look at it at the end of verse 19. They have set their minds on earthly things. That's the stuff that relates to they here and now. The physical, the houses they live in, the cars they drive, the work they do, the food they eat, the people they can see and touch. Their entire realm of
[time=2518] thought is centered in the earthly realities. They don't know anything beyond that. They can't see the eternal things. It's marvelous description, isn't it? Of the dominant culture. They're in
[time=2531] this destruction. God is their appetite or rather who's God is their appetite, who's glory is their
[time=2537] shame and who's set their minds on earthly things. Now you say, "Well, what kind of an attitude should we have about that?" Well, look at verse 18. Rather than a demeaning sort of degrading
[time=2549] holier than vow attitude, what Paul shows us for many walk, verse 18, of whom I often told you and
[time=2556] now tell you even what? Even weeping. This is the letter of joy. This is the letter of happiness.
[time=2564] And the only thing that brings the guy to tears, isn't his imprisonment, isn't the impending death that may come his way? Isn't the fact that beloved brother and our betraying him in their pursuit
[time=2574] of prestige inside the Christian community? It's that he looks clearly at the condition of the lost and even as he tries to pin it, wherever he was sitting at this moment, putting pin departement, his eyes begin to swell up in water and he begins to audibly weep over their condition.
[time=2588] That's compassion. That's compassion. He is saying, "Don't allow the dominant culture to persuade
[time=2596] you away from your convictions. Look past the facade, see the sorry condition of their souls,
[time=2603] and let it strike you deep somewhere inside so that you rise above the peer pressure and have deep and compelling compassion on those who are lost around you." That's what he's saying.
[time=2613] You want to stand firm, you got to see your friends, your unsafe friends and your associates for who they are, and you got to be stricken with compassion for their condition and then their attempt to woo you into the things of the world will only further highlight the futility of their
[time=2628] lifestyle and the frailty of their being. Are these the words of our Lord? When before he
[time=2635] entered Jerusalem for the last time where they would kill and crucify him, he said, "Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often I have wanted to gather you together as a mother her children, even as a mother hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you would not kill the prophets." The reason he could
[time=2652] stand firm in his resolution to do the will of God and not to succumb to the temptations either of Satan or the world system itself is because in part he could look past the condition of the
[time=2663] external appearance of human beings to the condition of their soul and he had, he had says his gut was wrenched with compassion. Paul felt the same things, not just here as he was weeping writing this
[time=2676] letter to the Philippians, but in an earlier letter talking about his own kinsman, the nation of Israel,
[time=2683] as you know he was Jewish and looking at his other Jewish unbelievers. He said this for I could wish that I myself were accursed. What does that mean? Does that mean that I could die? No, separated from
[time=2694] Christ for the sake of my brother and my kinsman according to the flesh. He wished himself accursed
[time=2700] and of course it was to no avail and he knew that. You can only come to Christ through a personal relationship with Christ. No one can die in your stead. No one can go to hell in your stead other than Christ. But he said, "If only it were possible. I have so much compassion and so much love for my fellow Jews that if it were possible I would elect hell for eternity so that they could have heaven."
[time=2720] Talk about. Talk about another's orientation. Talk about a longing to see them receive the benefit.
[time=2730] So he says, "I weep as I describe to you these enemies of the cross." So there is not a tone of
[time=2738] hostility here. There is not a tone of demeaning kind of a castrating, desensitizing reality as we
[time=2746] would stand aloof and say look at them. Their end is destruction. Their appetite is their God. No, it's one of deep, meaningful compassion. I look at the third point he means. The third point he
[time=2757] brings is in verses 20 and 21. For our citizenship is in heaven from which also we eagerly wait for a
[time=2764] savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory by the exertion of the power that he has even to subject all things to himself.
[time=2775] What's he saying? Part of standing firm in a hostile dominant culture is knowing your position
[time=2784] of belonging to the person of Christ that your citizenship is in heaven that you have identity
[time=2790] and there is a sense of self-worth and you have a belonging and a connectedness that matters to you enough to stay with it. I was reading this week about the gangs and the gang violence and all
[time=2803] that's going on and I came across an article about a man named Cody Scott who later because of his
[time=2810] accomplishments in his crypt gang in South Central Los Angeles was given the name "Monster"
[time=2817] and he's still to this day at least as the writing of the article is committed to his being a warlord
[time=2824] in one of the crypt gangs in South Central Los Angeles but the story started back in the early 70s when he was in sixth grade and he tells the story of how the disintegration of the family and we
[time=2836] can look beyond his own experience and know that with the disintegration of the family there is no longer for children a strong father, a loving mother and a conscientious community and a church
[time=2846] such as this where they can find the reinforcement and the examples to live and to feel connected to something that is meaningful and we were built for that stuff that's why God grants it to us in our salvation and without it there is this huge void of emptiness and for many it's getting filled
[time=2862] with gangs and he talks about leaving his sixth grade graduation going barely thinking about the
[time=2869] graduation and as soon as he hit the door of home he ran to the back bedroom, changed his clothes, flew out the back window and headed to his initiation because that very night he would become initiated
[time=2879] into the gang and as he described his memory he thought about the respect that he would have if he
[time=2885] could wear the colors and the belonging and the connectedness he could have as he could walk through the streets and be there with other brothers of the same thing and he longed for that identity that night they beat him, they struck him and he made the mistake of falling over it which
[time=2900] time they kicked him and he quickly learned that they were testing his resolve to be able to take blows and not hit the deck and it meant so much to him to be a part of this group to have this sense of belonging that he continued standing as he took the blows one after another.
[time=2914] They cleaned him up a little bit and put a pump shotgun in his hand that they said held
[time=2920] eight shells and they commanded him do not come back to us and tell you have fired all eight shots
[time=2927] part of his initiation so they jumped in a stolen car they found some enemy gang members who were unsuspecting they came out of nowhere and this little sixth grade boy tells the story of his pride
[time=2938] and joy to empty all six shots and he killed many people that night but it went right over his head
[time=2947] because what mattered to him was he now belonged he had a sense of connectedness you know not
[time=2953] justifying his behavior we are talking about a common reality of humaneness that longs to have a citizenship that longs to have partnership with people who care about them and the Lord is saying yes
[time=2965] you're in a dominant culture that has hostile to your Christian faith and that beckons you to compromise morally and materialistically and and relationally in every way and to take their
[time=2975] values as your values and he says don't you dare you don't need that partnership you don't need
[time=2981] connectedness with them for you have it with me your citizenship is in heaven think about it your name is written in heaven in the lambs book of life from the moment that you confess Christ as your savior you spend the better part of your time learning the word of God the law of heaven because you're a citizen of heaven and how to live it here on earth you speak a certain type of heavenes or christianes our language we're able to to discuss heavenly truth that unbelievers can't they don't have the spirit of God to interpret the things of God and our speech unlike theirs is to always
[time=3012] be seasoned with grace as food would be with salt so we speak a different language and we are loyal
[time=3019] to heaven's cause so he says remember I've given you everything pertaining to life and
[time=3026] godliness your citizenship is in heaven that's your true identity and then he says in verse 20 also eagerly wait for the savior the Lord Jesus Christ verse 21 who will transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory remember our study of Revelation 22 our
[time=3042] body will actually be illumined illumined by the glory of God we too will shine even as does Christ
[time=3050] how does that occur the end of verse 21 by the exertion of his power that he has even to subject
[time=3056] all things to himself this marvelous universe we're discovering and the intricacies of microbiology that we're discovering all of that is held together by the power of Jesus Christ and if that same power he'll use to transform your body from its earthly sickly dying state into the glorious
[time=3073] eternal body that he has in store so he stands and he says to you stand firm look again now
[time=3082] chapter 4 verse 1 and listen to the soft tones listen to the pastoral heart therefore my beloved
[time=3089] brethren whom I long to see my joy and crown then the imperative so stand firm in the Lord
[time=3098] but cushioned again by my beloved he has a sympathetic understanding heart he knows how hard it
[time=3104] is to stand out here as a minority group in a dominant culture he knows the struggles that we have
[time=3111] whether we're 14 whether we're 40 or 60 we know the temptations to fall and so he says number one
[time=3119] follow positive examples make sure the significant others of your life are strong dedicated Christians
[time=3125] to look past the facade of the unbelieving world and understand them see them for what they really are
[time=3131] and weep with me over their condition and therefore have an agenda to save them not be influenced
[time=3137] by them for wrong and then finally he says remember your citizenship remember your true identity is
[time=3144] with me forever and you don't need connectedness with them you have it with me as we close listen to the words of AWS tozer some years ago talking about the oddities of being a
[time=3159] Christian how different we really are quote he feels supreme love for one whom he has never seen
[time=3168] speaking of the Christian he talks familiarly every day with someone he cannot see expects to go to
[time=3174] heaven on the virtue of another empties himself in order to be full admits he is wrong so he can be
[time=3180] declared right goes down in order to go up is strongest when he is weakest richest when he is poorest happiest when he feels the worst he dies so he can live for sakes in order to have he gives
[time=3192] away so he can keep he sees the invisible here's the inaudible and knows that which passes knowledge
[time=3199] we're pretty weird group we look pretty normal when we go out there but in reality this tells us
[time=3208] and reminds us we're pretty different these are unique and distinctive values and it's our joy and
[time=3214] it's our obligation to stand firm and to have our agenda for the cause of Christ to be the determining factor in relationships with other people not the other way around let's pray together
[time=3225] father thank you for these reminders from God's word and I think of those in our midst today who
[time=3237] are believers but who are weak believers who are looking at other people unsaved people or other
[time=3245] weak Christians who are not standing for the purposes of God and who are giving those people
[time=3251] positions of power in their lives to affect their attitudes their decisions their priorities
[time=3258] and Lord we would be called by this passage this morning to remove those people from our lives
[time=3266] maybe not entirely but certainly to back them off until we have found others who do represent the interests of Christ and I pray you give these the strength to do that and for those in our
[time=3278] assembly this morning who have already grown and who would represent these mature Christians that can stand and can lead the path I pray you give them a special interest to look behind them and
[time=3289] see those who are struggling and invite them into meaningful relationship and to provide that kind of example and Lord as we think about those even as this message has been preached to our
[time=3301] unsaved whether they're family members or whether they're bosses or employees or neighbors
[time=3307] and at times we can fail to see the true condition their true lost condition
[time=3313] help us like Paul to see it and not just see it but to weep over it and to be drawn in our spirit to
[time=3320] do something about it and help us to hold as a priority our citizenship in heaven the reality that
[time=3329] we are connected that we do have a place of belonging that we are not left wondering without that sense
[time=3338] of identity thank you for our citizenship in heaven it may it be the presiding prevailing reality
