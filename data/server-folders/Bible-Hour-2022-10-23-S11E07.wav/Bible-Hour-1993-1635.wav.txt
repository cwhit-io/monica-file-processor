[time=0] You just understand what the people around him thought about him.
[time=16] They went on to describe some of their understandings and they presented the contemporaries of our Lord as being equally confused because they said our Lord was confusing as a teacher
[time=27] that when he spoke, he was hard to understand because he spoke in parables and pithy little statements and he didn't understand the cultural milieu and how, excuse me, people would misunderstand
[time=38] what he thought he meant and so they left you as a reader with the very clear impression
[time=44] that Christ didn't know who he was and even his own contemporaries who heard him preach and teach and saw his actions and watched his life and witnessed the whole thing also were equally confused.
[time=70] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=76] find to be an encouragement.
[time=78] Thank you for joining us.
[time=79] Who was Jesus?
[time=81] Itinerant preacher, healer, gifted teacher, pretender, troublemaker?
[time=86] One thing is for sure, contemporary theologians and scholars want to depict him as nothing more than one of history's most intriguing figures.
[time=94] They claim Jesus might not even have been certain of his own identity.
[time=98] They also suggest that those people in Galilee who knew him heard his teaching and even saw his wondrous works were also confused about his identity because they say he was unclear
[time=109] and vague in his teaching style.
[time=111] But should we accept what they say?
[time=113] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore explores God's word to answer the question who was Jesus.
[time=120] Our special music today will be provided by Praise Kids, one of our children's choirs
[time=129] and by Brian Losson.
[time=134] Let's join Praise Kids as they begin our service.

[time=229] him in an everlasting friend, so come and ask him in your heart, hallelujah, hallelujah,
[time=244] this baby Jesus or for a man, you will find him in an everlasting friend, so come and
[time=256] ask him in your heart.
[time=280] We want to wish you a Merry Christmas.
[time=281] We trust you have had a great year and that you're enjoying the holiday season.
[time=286] Our family has certainly gone through a number of changes in the last 12 months and we're always excited at this time to share with you some of those changes.
[time=293] Our eldest daughter, Randy, has just had her 12th birthday not too long ago.
[time=297] She's in junior high and excited about her life at school.
[time=301] She's involved in a lot of the athletics there, played volleyball, is now involved in basketball and also a cheerleader and she's excited about what God's doing in her life.
[time=309] Our two middle daughters, Nikki and Kelly are also excited about the Christmas season because they have parts in the living Christmas tree and so they're thrilled each day to get ready for the living Christmas tree performances, get all dressed up and play their part as the gospel goes forth through to the many thousands of people who come to the living Christmas tree.
[time=329] Our youngest daughter, Whitney, just recently had her 4th birthday and she's got new responsibilities in the home because our son, Bobby, has arrived and she is kind of number one mom when all the
[time=340] other girls are at school and then of course we're thankful for our son.
[time=344] He kind of completes our family for us and some in our church had suggested that we call
[time=350] him Noah, Noah more as if to say we had enough kids and that's true we have I think now
[time=356] had enough but we chose to name him after my father, Robert Imore and so little Bobby's a tremendous addition.
[time=361] And then of course I'm always overwhelmed with thankfulness in my heart for my life, Heidi
[time=368] who manages our household of seven and somehow manages to keep up with my busy schedule and the needs of our church and so we're moving along in the Lord.
[time=376] We're thankful for his goodness to us and we trust that you and your family are enjoying the grace of God that you're reflecting upon the gift of his son this season that you too are thankful for the many wonderful things that's going on in your life.
[time=388] God bless you and Merry Christmas.
[time=391] I'd love to sell a great love worth of Jesus Christ my King to take you for a special gift
[time=408] of love.
[time=409] The greatest gift God gave to me was to give the gift of his own son now that's what
[time=419] Christmas means to me.
[time=427] Christmas is Jesus, he's alive he lives today, Christmas is Jesus, he's the truth of life,
[time=438] he is the way, Christmas is Jesus, our love to shout and sing and Christmas time and
[time=449] all year around, singing praises to my King, at Christmas time and all year around, singing
[time=458] praises to my King.
[time=463] Now some gifts just don't really know what Christmas is about, they think it's only toys
[time=477] that Christmas trees, Jesus came to give his life, his greatest gift to all now that's
[time=489] what Christmas means to me, Christmas is Jesus, he's alive he lives today, Christmas is
[time=505] Jesus, he's the truth of life, he is the way, Christmas is Jesus, our love to shout and
[time=516] sing and Christmas time and all year around, singing praises to my King, at Christmas time
[time=526] and all year around, singing praises to my King.
[time=539] Our special gift this month is the beautiful book by Johnny Erickson Tata, a Christmas longing.

[time=569] I heard the bells on Christmas Day, their old familiar carols play, and wild and sweet
[time=587] the words repeat of peace on earth good will to man.
[time=599] Do you hear what I hear?
[time=605] Said the night went to the little lamb, Do you see what I sing?
[time=616] Way up in the sky, little lamb, Do you see what I sing?
[time=626] A star, a star, dancing in the night, Where the tail has big as a kite, where the tail has big as a kite.
[time=644] Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, Do you hear what I hear?
[time=655] Bringing through the sky, shepherd boy, Do you hear what I hear?
[time=664] A song, a song, high above the trees, Where the voice has big as the sea, where the voice has big as the sea.
[time=681] Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king, Do you know what I know?
[time=692] In your palace warm mighty king, Do you know what I know?
[time=701] A child, a child, shivers in the cold, Let us bring him silver and gold, Let us bring him silver and gold.
[time=724] Said the king to the people everywhere, Listen to what I sing.
[time=734] Brave would these people everywhere, Listen to what I sing, the child, the child, sleeping in the night.
[time=748] He will bring us goodness and light, He will bring us goodness and light.
[time=778] Thank you, Brian, beautifully done.
[time=787] Well, I come to the pulpit this morning armed with three periodicals nationally recognized, all of which were published December 20th and I believe there's a connection in them somewhere.
[time=800] The first is people weekly or people magazine on the cover, it talks about little poly class, the title taken in the night.
[time=809] And you may have read this, I'm sure you've heard about it, this lovely young 12 year old girl in her own home, her mother, and her sister sleeping in the room next door, a few of her friends over for a sleepover.
[time=820] And what her was her lifelong fear that she would be taken by the boogeyman was a reality and she was taken that the girls were those left behind were tied up and she was taken off into the darkness and eventually killed.
[time=837] And I guess this article by itself is horrible, but when you recognize it represents a trend in our culture, it becomes even more devastating.
[time=847] But the young people in our country are being abused at a rate they never have been in the past, they are falling into the hands of people who hurt them and who lead them to the use of drugs and academically they struggle and they fall into gangs and teen pregnancies are on the rise and child abuse is on the rise and as I've told you in days past teen suicide is higher than it's ever been by three times in the last 30 years.
[time=877] The next article also December 20th or the next magazine cover reports by time a picture of a ruger 9 millimeter enough it exclaims the massacre on a suburban New York train escalates the war over hand guns and it tells the horrible story of Colin Ferguson how he brandish this weapon and shot 23 people killed six.
[time=900] Unfortunately he's not alone six such massacres and 15 days in the month of December have occurred one article reported six commuters killed in a New York train four pizza parlor workers slain and a Denver suburb by a man police say is a former employee two shoppers gun down in Oklahoma the gunman commits suicide a police officer and three unemployment workers killed in California police shot the gunman in separate work related shootings on Thursday a geologist shot and killed his brother.
[time=930] And another man before committing suicide in Boise Idaho and in Michigan a teacher involved in a union grievance was charged with slaying the school superintendent and wounding the principal and another teacher.
[time=943] All six of those incidents in the last 15 days or in a 15 day period in the month of December.
[time=951] We recognize that this cover only talks to us about a level of violence that's going on in our culture that is unprecedented.
[time=958] There seems to be no boundary to the kinds of violence that will tolerate or allow to occur even in Fort Wayne this weekend.
[time=965] The fifth car jacking this year.
[time=968] According to a root assault and South Anthony a man sitting there to stoplight money his own business somebody jumps in the passenger side points a gun at him and says get out.
[time=978] Also this weekend an 84 year old woman who is a part of our who was a part of our super 60s ministry here regularly on Fridays enjoying the singing and the fellowship and the food.
[time=988] And intruder broke into her home this weekend and for fear she died.
[time=993] Overcome by the fact that somebody would break right into her home when she was there her age the situation overcame her and she's dead.
[time=1004] And then there is this third magazine also published December 20th 1993 US news and world report.
[time=1012] The question is who was Jesus and instead of a picture of a little girl who was abducted and instead of a weapon that was used to kill six people there is a picture of what they assume Jesus might have looked like no one of course knows.
[time=1027] And the question is who is Jesus and I seem to believe that these covers are related in no strange way.
[time=1034] The problem is nobody knows anymore and nobody cares. Seems as if nobody in America knows anymore who Jesus was and nobody cares.
[time=1045] And if you were to read this article who was Jesus you would find that it offers no help whatsoever in fact it contributes to the problem because it presents the Lord as an enigma.
[time=1057] And enigma is something in fact they use that word in the article which is unknown it's intangible it's impossible to really understand.
[time=1065] And they go on to report that Jesus was and an enigma and he remains throughout history is one of the most intriguing figures but still unknown and unknowable.
[time=1074] In the article they cite a number of what they alleged to be great scholars and theologians and typically from very liberal institutions around the country and all of these men are adding their voice.
[time=1085] The voices of authority to the notion that we can't really know Christ we can't really understand who he was what he stood for what his message was about.
[time=1096] In fact they go so far as to say they're not even sure Christ knew who he was and what Christ's mission was.
[time=1104] They say that he typically would refrain from declaring his own deity and it may have been later in his own life until he finally figured out that he was the Messiah.
[time=1114] But even then the word Messiah they say had so many different meanings in that culture that we can't even be sure which meaning he had for himself whether he was a political liberator, a helper of the poor, a great teacher what did it mean in his mind to be the Messiah.
[time=1129] So they they even proposed the notion that he was confused about his own identity and his own mission.
[time=1136] Having said that they then say we would be best to understand his identity by trying to comprehend what his contemporaries thought about him and they say that his contemporaries were uncertain because he wasn't very clear in his message because he was known to use parables and use pithy little statements and even in those statements he would misunderstand the meaning of his words in the cultural milieu of the day and so he left his own audiences confused as to his message into his identity.
[time=1166] The end of the article says well I guess we'll just have to assume he is the unknown, unknowable Messiah and that he doesn't even have a name because the name that he chose for himself Messiah seemed to have been so misunderstood in its own day.
[time=1184] I'll tell you what I'm I guess I'm wishing that that little molly glass didn't have to be on the cover and all that she represents all the hundreds of thousands of young people that are being abused on a weekly basis in our country and I'm sorry for the picture of a ruger and its representation of a very violent and lost society that is resorted to killing itself.
[time=1213] And I also I guess I'm sorry for this news article, US News and World Report about Christ because it only continues to propagate the problem.
[time=1222] It only seems to confuse the populace worst and I guess there's a television show tonight that corresponds was co-produced by US News and World Report and so it'll take this confusing message of Christ on the air.
[time=1236] And so in a time when we desperately need clarity about the person of Christ the best we get from the media is a further statement of confusion about who he is and what he can do.
[time=1246] So this morning I thought we might spend a little time on the notion of was Christ clear in his claim to be God and did his contemporaries understand what he was saying.
[time=1260] Was Christ clear when he claimed to be God and did his contemporaries understand him we might begin by turning to John chapter 8.
[time=1269] And I'm going to cite a number of different passages this morning we won't work out of anyone particular text and I may reference as many as 25 or 50 different verses that I'll either read or comment on.
[time=1279] At times I'll ask you to turn to a few of them and when I do I suggest you turn there so you can see with your own eyes the truth of God's word.
[time=1288] John chapter 8 the first statement I want to make this morning is that Jesus claimed to be God Jesus claimed to be God in no uncertain terms and he was perfectly understood when he said it.
[time=1302] In John chapter 8 verses 57 and following you find the Lord in the company of some men who understood the Old Testament they hadn't just made a brief reading of it they had devoted their lives to the study of the Old Testament and they understood all about the history of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and on through the line.
[time=1321] They prided themselves in their understanding of the knowledge of the Old Testament and someone of a dispute arose in verse 56 the Lord says your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad.
[time=1338] Verse 57 the Jews therefore said to him you are not yet 50 years old and have you seen Abraham.
[time=1346] You see they didn't understand what the Lord was saying I mean they were questioning what in the world are you trying to assert here.
[time=1353] You're not yet 50 years old which was generous at this time the Lord may have been 31 or 32 years of age and they're supposing how can a man who is only 32 years of age have known someone who predated him by 1500 to 2000 years.
[time=1369] How in the world could that have occurred what are you trying to say and they are almost mocking him in their question Jesus answers them in verse 58.
[time=1379] Jesus said to them truly truly I say to you before Abraham was born I am.
[time=1387] Now when you and I hear that we think well that's bad English to say I am what does that mean I am is a way to establish the Lord's absolute eternal existence.
[time=1399] When he says I am he is saying there never was a time when I wasn't in any time you can think of past present or future I am in the present being or status of existing I always have been I am and I always will be there is a constant continuity of my existence.
[time=1415] Never been out of existence and so of course I was before Abraham was born beyond that I'll tell you before time began I existed.
[time=1424] Now still that may not be as clear to you and me as it was to them having studied the Old Testament these people knew full and well that the only person who ever said I am was the true and living God.
[time=1435] This was the statement of Yahweh in the Old Testament the creator of the heavens and the earth who made everything that is and created everything that ever will be it was that Old Testament Yahweh the true and living God who these men worshipped as God over and over and over and over in the Old Testament Yahweh would say I am I am I am.
[time=1457] Remember Moses who shall I say has sent me the Moses asked Yahweh when he was about to embark on his mission to the Pharaoh and God said just say I am sent you the one who has always been the one who will never not be the one who has absolute eternal self sustaining existence God.
[time=1478] And they understood it. You say how do you know they understood it well look at verse 59. Therefore they picked up stones to throw at him but Jesus hit himself and went out of the temple.
[time=1492] They picked up stones because that's what you did to someone who blasphemed God.
[time=1497] Anybody who would claim to be God would be in the category of blasphemy and what you did to a blasphemer was you picked up stones and you you brutally killed them with those stones that also was a part of the Old Testament law.
[time=1509] These men not only knew the existence of God to be expressed through the phrase I am they also knew the consequence of blasphemy to have been stoning death by stoning.
[time=1518] There was no confusion in their mind what he was saying in fact had he said it any other way he would have been less clear to them to understand what I'm saying he knew they were he knew what they knew he knew what they had studied he knew the most powerful way to declare to them his own deity was to say that before Abraham was born I am.
[time=1539] It was a skillful and masterfully chosen set of words to bring to them in neon signs the reality that he is saying I am the true and living God the one you have worshiped in the Old Testament Yahweh I take the same identity.
[time=1557] What happens again Matthew 26 come with me there in the last several chapters of the book of Matthew we find the various trials of our Lord that led to his crucifixion and he is brought from one mock trial to another.
[time=1577] Matthew 26 in verse 57 he is before Caiaphas the high priest in one of these trials now Caiaphas like the group he was speaking to in John is a group of is a man who has studied the Old Testament it has distinguished himself as a preeminent intellectual and student so that he could hold the position of high priest.
[time=1605] Also within their in verse 57 are the scribes and the elders they were all gathered together this is a group of very intelligent well studied men versed in the Old Testament.
[time=1615] Verse 58 is a little footnote about Peter Peter also was following him in a distance as far as the courtyard of the high priest and entered in and sat down with the officers to see the outcome.
[time=1625] 59 now the chief priest and the whole council kept trying to obtain false testimony against Jesus in order that they might put him to death.
[time=1633] They did not find even though they may they brought many false witnesses to come forward in other words they could find nothing to charge him with and so they brought false witnesses into the courtroom and even those were of no avail because they were false witnesses and they couldn't substantiate their claims.
[time=1650] The end of verse 60 60 but later on two came forward and said this man stated I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild it in three days.
[time=1662] Now that's a claim to deity because only God could tear down the temple in three days they didn't have the kind of equipment and technology that we have today let alone dynamite how would a man how would a mere man tear down a huge temple in three days.
[time=1678] And then go beyond that and rebuild it all in the space of three days.
[time=1683] Verse 62 the high priest stood up and said to him do you make no answer in other words he's saying these guys are accusing you of proclaiming yourself divine.
[time=1693] Do you make no answer what is it that these men are testifying against you verse 63 but Jesus kept silent and the high priest said to him I endure you by the living God that you tell us whether you are the Christ the son of God.
[time=1711] Now the question is posed to him by the high priest and all who were in the hearing of that question the scribes and the elders knew exactly what it meant to be called the son of God.
[time=1721] Verse 64 Jesus said to him you have said it yourself you got it nevertheless I tell you here after you shall see the son of man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.
[time=1736] All of those are Old Testament quotes that come to us out of the Psalms and Daniel and these men again knew those scriptures and knew the exact import of such a statement.
[time=1747] That the son of man sitting on the at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven that is a statement about his authority and about his position to judge.
[time=1757] Not only am I the son of God the next time you see me you will see me coming in judgment with the authority of the very God that I am.
[time=1767] I dare say he didn't avoid saying who he was in fact he was uniquely expressing his genius in the ways that he said who he was because he knew his audience he knew their information and he knew the exact buttons to push to communicate to them beyond any shadow of a doubt his deity.
[time=1787] Verse 65 did they get the point do you think they understood then the high priest tore his robes saying he has blasphemed what further do we need of witnesses behold you have now heard the blasphemy what do you think and so he turns to the scribes and the elders who were there they answered and said he is deserving of death.
[time=1810] So they why do they say that well like the other group in John 8 they are fully aware that when you claim to be God you have blasphemed and you deserve to die it was the death penalty in the Old Testament the blaspheme God they knew all about it they knew exactly what he was saying and they were prescribing the proper punishment for one who would blaspheme against God.
[time=1829] Then they go further verse 67 they spat in his face and beat him with their fists and others slapped him and said prophesy to us you Christ who is the one who hit you which is another indication that they knew exactly what he was saying he was claiming deity and with deity comes omniscience and so many would slap him in succession he wouldn't see all of them and so they would test his deity by saying tell us which one hit you.
[time=1856] Make no mistake about it they knew exactly who he said he was and that was the basis of their reaction against him.
[time=1866] In John 14 he said I am the way the truth and the life the definite articles in front of each one I am the only way I am the only truth I am the only life and no man comes to the father but through me.
[time=1885] Now that's pretty clear that's pretty definitive how a person could hear that a misunderstanding what he is saying goes beyond my ability to understand.
[time=1895] You almost have to say that language makes no sense I mean to say that Jesus wasn't clear you almost have to say that language makes no sense and we can't even rely on the vehicle of communication anymore because that's pretty clean.
[time=1908] John 11 he said I am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me shall live even if he dies and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.
[time=1922] The message is clear the message is indisputable he claimed over and over and over and over again to be God and he was over and over again completely and perfectly understood by his contemporaries.
[time=1935] Now certainly along the way there may have been misunderstandings along the way there may have been some who queried at his comments and who didn't fully understand everything he was saying but the vast majority of people who heard him and is particularly the religious leaders of his day got it in bold clear technicolour I am the true and living God.
[time=1956] And Matthew 16 16 Jesus Jesus asked Peter who do you think that I am and Peter said thou art the Christ the son of the living God and the Lord affirmed him in that statement.
[time=1970] Number two number two you would expect that if God were to come in the form of human flesh he would live an absolutely perfect sinless life because that's what it's all about right.
[time=1981] The reason for the Lamb of God the reason for the need of a savior the reason for somebody to come and save us from our sins is because we're sinful and a sinful person can't die for sinful people and have any effect in the eyes of a holy and a righteous God.
[time=1994] So if in fact he is the true and living God then what we would expect to find is a sinless life and that is exactly what we find.
[time=2002] And he claims such in John 824 he said I always do the things that are pleasing to my father.
[time=2010] Now think about that I mean what a wonderful thing to be able to say all of my life in every circumstance in every relationship in every situation I always do the things that are pleasing to my father.
[time=2026] So both in heart and mind and spirit we read in the gospels the account of how he treated his family how he treated his disciples how he treated the multitudes how he treated the false religious leaders how he handled Satan and Matthew 4 the temptation in the wilderness in every single circumstances he was blameless.
[time=2044] Absolutely sinless he bruce for said he was tempted in all things as we are yet without sin. He experienced the full blast of temptation by Satan and a world system and yet he was without sin.
[time=2058] Hebrews 7 calls him holy innocent and undefiled so it is as we would expect he said he was sinless and he was sinless.
[time=2067] You say did he's contemporaries understand that about him? Did they know that? I mean did they figure that out? You bet Peter a man who lived with him for three years traveled with him everywhere he went saw him under all the pressure cooker situations of his entire life both publicly and privately said in first Peter 2 he committed no sin nor was any deceit found in his mouth.
[time=2095] Walked with him day in and day out and said he committed no sin and then he said nor was there any deceit found in his mouth you know what the Bible says about your mouth it's the gateway to your heart and if you have sin in your heart it'll eventually come out of your mouth.
[time=2107] Peter knew that what Peter was saying is this man not only didn't commit external behaviors of sin he never even evidenced any internal sin absolutely righteous and pure.
[time=2117] John said this to you and to me if any man says he has no sin he's a liar and the truth is not in him anybody who's ever lived stands up and says I'm pure I'm blameless no sin in me John says you're a liar truth isn't in you.
[time=2133] But what did you say about Christ first John three five in him there is no sin. John was well acquainted as was Peter with the notion of sin because they'd studied the Old Testament and they'd read Genesis one two and three and they'd seen the fall and they'd seen the depravity of man and they'd seen the wickedness of people they were men very familiar with the concept of sinful human beings and yet they closely scrutinized his life and came up with the absolute verdict sinless.
[time=2162] The thief on the cross for example said and we indeed justly speaking about their crucifixion but he said for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong.
[time=2177] So in the moment of crisis even that thief who was later in paradise with God was able to say and give testimony this man is blameless we're dying for just cause he dies in innocence.
[time=2188] He said well those were his friends of course maybe Peter and John and even the thief on the cross they were benevolent to the cause of Christ what about his enemies.
[time=2197] Well I already showed you in the trial of Caiaphas they brought testimony after testimony false testimony people who were paid to come and lie about the person of Christ and they could find no grounds upon which to convict him.
[time=2209] Beyond that in John 846 there's a crowd of people in front of him and he says this which of you convicts me of sin. Now if I were to say that this morning we'd have quite a little party here.
[time=2220] A lot of you know of my sin a lot of you have seen my fear he stands up silence nobody says a thing just absolutely nobody has anything to say.
[time=2229] Pilate in Matthew 27 after trying the Lord steps out to the crowd of the Jews that are below him and you remember he's washing his hands to say I'm innocent of this thing and he says what evil has this man done.
[time=2241] Referring to Christ he'd been in the chamber he'd examined his life he'd heard the testimony he could find nothing and so he goes to the crowds and say what did he do.
[time=2250] You know what they say crucify him they don't say what he did he didn't do anything they just cry for his death they had every opportunity to proclaim his sin and hear a whole populace of people who would have watched him grow up and seen his life experiences and seen him when he thought nobody was watching him and none of them could say anything except killing because there was no charge to make.
[time=2273] He was holy and pure and blameless most interesting to me is Judas Judas is the guy who also walked in his close company for those three years and saw the inner circle and heard the inside conversations and who himself betrayed the Lord you remember for 30 pieces.
[time=2291] And after he had done his wicked deed and the Lord had been taken from the Garden of Gethsemane he repented of his deeds in a certain sense was sorrowful that he done it went back to the place those who had bribed him and tried to give the money back they said we don't want it and we don't care about you so he dispensed with the 30 pieces and then said this I have sinned by betraying innocent blood those are the words of Judas Matthew 27 for I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.
[time=2317] If anybody on the planet would have liked to have found fault to justify his own betrayal of Christ it would have been Judas to assuage his own sense of betraying this great and awesome man if he could have found but one sin in the guy's life I'm sure he would have articulated it but instead he said I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.
[time=2338] So whether you be his friend or whether you be his enemy having watched him his whole life or parts of his life from the outer circle or the inner circle the testimony comes up absolutely spotless sinless as you might expect as you might expect when God becomes human when God takes on the form of human flesh for the very purpose of redeeming men from their sinfulness and has been foretold for 2000 years as a lamb of God without spot you might expect him to live a sinless life he did.
[time=2367] Well there's a third point I want to make and it has to do with his work it has to do with his works his miraculous works because the Lord knew that he was walking around telling people he was God and they maybe didn't have the benefit of of being there at the birth and seeing the star lead the wise men miraculously to the very location and watching the wise men fall and worship him.
[time=2393] Many of the people would have no knowledge of the Isaiah 7 testimony that he would be born of a virgin and how would they verify that he was born of a virgin anyway I mean how do you prove that they would have had the benefit of that information they wouldn't have had the opportunity to see his sinless life on the inside circle they would have been on the outside and maybe just heard rumors about him and here he is saying is God and how would he ever prove to them that he was truly the living God what evidence could he give them.
[time=2422] Well he gave them miracles he gave them miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle and he did it any time he wanted to do it and there was no limit to it there was no parameters for his miracles there was no extent to which he would go he absolutely performed every possible miracle conceivable over and over and over again so that anybody who saw him would know this man is unique now what did he say about his identity.
[time=2448] He said he is God and he does this. Luke 7-22 the blind received sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to him that is the testimony of the life of Christ.
[time=2463] Matthew 4 and the news about him went into all Syria and they brought to him all who were ill taken with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics and he healed them all.
[time=2477] This isn't one of these television huckster guys that brings people in an audience and they have certain maladies that may or may not actually exist and they fall on the ground they get up and they're healed and they walk out.
[time=2489] The Lord Jesus Christ healed every kind of conceivable disease known to his generation and in fact in his three and a half year ministry through Palestine he basically eradicated all disease wiped it out gone.
[time=2503] The Lord Jesus Christ could go down to Parkview right now and go into any ward you lead him to and heal every single person in the hospital he could clean the place out everybody goes home well everybody goes home totally satisfied.
[time=2519] You say what do you mean well let me listen to you listen to the miracles that our Lord did.
[time=2525] Three categories first he had power over nature power over nature he turned the water in the wine in John 2 he still the storm in Matthew 8 he controlled the fish in Luke 5 he multiplied food in John 6 he walked on the water in Matthew 8 and he caused a fig tree to dry up by merely cursing it in Matthew 21.
[time=2544] Disease he healed a leper in Matthew 8 a paralytic in Matthew 9 he healed the fever of Peter's mother-in-law in Mark 1 the nobleman son in John 4 a withered hand in Mark 3 death and dumb in Mark 7 blindness in John 9 and 10 lepers in Luke 7 absolute 17 absolute total control over any kind of disease anybody brought him you name it he healed it.
[time=2569] Death Jarius daughter he raised her from the dead in Matthew 9 he raised the widow's son in Luke 7 and you remember John 11 he brought Lazarus back to life against the warnings of his contemporaries they were standing outside the grave and they said don't have that tombstone roll the way he's been in there too long his body has begun to decay it's going to smell give it up.
[time=2595] The Lord said roll that thing away Lazarus come forth and Lazarus came forth not smelling the stench of death but totally and completely brought back to life.
[time=2606] John 20 says many other signs therefore Jesus also performed the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book.
[time=2613] Not only did he do the ones we've read about he did a whole bunch of other ones that the book couldn't contain it would have been too long to contain all of those.
[time=2623] Come with me to Mark chapter 2 let me show you you say well did they understand the import of his miracles when he did all that stuff did they get the message that he was really God you bet they did.
[time=2636] Mark chapter 2 verses 1 to 12 when he had come back to Capernaum several days afterward Mark chapter 2 it was heard that he was at home and many were gathered together so that there was no longer room.
[time=2652] Even near the door and he was speaking the word to them now that alone as a testimony to the power and the influence of the life of Christ.
[time=2660] Verse 3 they came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men in other words the reputation was so strong and so predominating that ancient world that Christ had the power to heal.
[time=2672] That when he showed up back even there at home the place is crowded they're beating down the doors there's no room for anybody else and people are carrying sick people to see him.
[time=2685] Verse 4 being unable to get him get to him and being unable to get to him meaning the paralytic couldn't get to Christ because of the crowd they removed the roof above him and when they had dug an opening they let down the pallet on which the paralytic was lying.
[time=2700] Now that's an interesting thing think about what these four men were thinking not only will they take their time and energy to pick up a pallet of a friend and haul him to the place where Jesus was but they were so convinced that he could heal people of this particular disease and really any kind of disease that getting there they couldn't get to the door so they climb on the roof and then they tear up somebody else's house.
[time=2723] That's literally what they did they dug through the roof now friends you don't do that on a whim you don't do that on a hunch you don't do that on the suspicion that Jesus might be able to heal somebody.
[time=2736] These men were absolutely totally convinced that Jesus Christ could heal people from their sicknesses so convinced that they risked the social embarrassment of climbing on somebody else's house and ripping the roof open and lowering their body to the presence of Christ.
[time=2752] That's conviction that's conviction verse five what's what happens.
[time=2759] Jesus interested to make the point Jesus seeing their faith said to the paralytic my son your sins are forgiven.
[time=2768] What? Verse six but there were some of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts.
[time=2775] Why does this man speak that way he is blaspheming who can forgive sins but God alone that's the point.
[time=2782] He's got a sick man in front of him and he says your sins are forgiven and these guys are going these scribes who know the word of God they're saying wait a minute you can't say that only God can forgive people sins.
[time=2793] And of course Jesus being God knows what's in their heart he knows what they're reasoning look at verse eight.
[time=2800] So this is the first miracle in the story and immediately Jesus answered in awareness spirit that they were reasoning that within them said to them why are you reasoning about these things in your heart.
[time=2812] I mean they're like caught cold we haven't uttered a word yet we're just thinking these thoughts in our heads and you already know we're thinking it.
[time=2818] Verse nine which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or arise take up your palate and walk what is he saying only God can do either one of those.
[time=2831] Only the true incarnate God can say for I forgive you of her sins or take up your palate walk both of those are things that only God can do.
[time=2840] So which is easier is the point look at verse 10 but in order that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralytic I say to you rise take up your palate and go home and he arose immediately and took up the palate and went out in the side of everybody.
[time=2857] You don't think they understood I mean this is the characteristic pattern of Christ absolute total complete healing this guy not only can stand up a paralytic who may have never walked in his life or certainly would have suffered muscle atrophy.
[time=2869] He doesn't get healed by Christ and then have to do exercises to be able to stand up and walk out of the place and to prove that point he says not only stand up and pick up your palate show people that you can bend over lift things up and carry them out of the room fight your way through the crowd.
[time=2882] Absolute obvious undeniable proof that complete and total instant healing has occurred you think they got the point like a verse 12 again the verse so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God saying we have never seen anything like this.
[time=2900] You bet they got the point you bet they got the point and he even went so far in that particular setting to clarify that I can both say your sins are forgiven and take up your palate and walk and I can tell you what you're thinking.
[time=2915] Now if there's any way to escape the obvious conclusion that the miracles of Christ were given to prove his identity as the true and living God it seems inescapable to me that you can't draw that conclusion.
[time=2927] Nicodemus for example in John chapter 3 Nicodemus a leading teacher of the Jews a man who had distinguished himself intellectually as a student of the Old Testament brilliant mind unbelievable thinker comes to Christ in the night and says this.
[time=2943] We know that you have come from God as a teacher he says there's no question about that it's absolutely obvious we know you have come from God as a teacher.
[time=2953] Why does he know that for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.
[time=2962] The miraculous testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ absolutely undeniable.
[time=2970] So the question who was Jesus as our liberal friends from us news and world report would love to deceive an entire populace at a time when our country needs to know more clearly than ever the true identity of Jesus Christ.
[time=2985] So that we can come to him submit ourselves to him be washed and cleansed of our sin by the lamb who was without blemish or spot.
[time=2996] And find in him the power and the strength to lead uniquely different lives.
[time=3001] At a time such as this they raise great questions and say he didn't even know who he was we've spent 20 minutes looking at the record do you agree.
[time=3011] I'm absolutely convinced he was completely certain of his identity.
[time=3016] He knew exactly why he had come others would say well but yeah he might have but they didn't know they didn't understand his message he was confusing he talked in parables.
[time=3024] He talked in pithy little statements he he didn't understand what his words meant to his culture.
[time=3029] Do you think so? I mean is that what we've concluded.
[time=3033] There are just a few examples I've given you we could give you more.
[time=3038] Let me give you the words in the words of historian Philip Schoff he says this quote.
[time=3044] This Jesus of Nazareth without money and arms conquered more millions than Alexander Caesar Muhammad and Napoleon without science and learning he shed more light on things human and divine than all philosophers and scholars combined.
[time=3057] Without the eloquence of schools he spoke such words of life as were never spoken before or since and produced effects which lie beyond the reach of order or poet.
[time=3067] Without writing a single line he has set more pins in motion and furnished themes for more sermons or aations discussions learned volumes works of art and songs of praise than the whole army of great men of ancient and modern times.
[time=3080] That's true and he student of history knows that Jesus Christ stands absolutely singular in his impact on humanity.
[time=3088] His influence alone should draw one to conclude that he was not a mere human being.
[time=3095] Some say he was just a good teacher but good teachers don't claim to be God.
[time=3102] Some say he was merely a good example but good examples don't mingle with prostitutes and sinners.
[time=3109] Some say he was a madman but madmen don't speak the way he spoke.
[time=3115] Some say he was a crazed fanatic but crazed fanatics don't draw children to themselves or attract men of intellect like Paul or Luke to be their followers.
[time=3126] Some say he was a religious phony but phony's don't rise from the dead.
[time=3131] Some say he was only a phantom but phantoms can't give their flesh and blood to be crucified. Some say he was only a myth but myths don't set the calendar for history.
[time=3145] Jesus has been called the ideal man an example of love, the highest model of religion, the foremost pattern of virtue, the greatest of all men and the finest teacher who ever lived.
[time=3154] All of these descriptions capture elements of his character but they all fall short of the full truth. The Apostle Thomas expressed it perfectly when he saw Jesus after the resurrection and exclaimed my Lord and my God.
[time=3173] As we look at what's going on in society, some of us have to look in our own heart. Some of you who are here today and say what's going on in society is going on in my heart.
[time=3181] I find in me the principle of sin, I find in me the longing and compassion to be involved in the deeds of darkness, it seems overwhelming, it seems compulsive, it seems out of my control.
[time=3194] And maybe by that you need to face the fact that you have not ever met the person of Jesus Christ in a personal and transforming way.
[time=3201] And though having come to Christ we can still be tempted there is a sense of being separated from the things of the world and longing instead the things of God.
[time=3210] And my hope and my prayer is that in this Christmas season you will not be further confused.
[time=3217] I mean it seems to me that the incidents which mark our generation, the mass murders that occur, the way children that are being treated, the things that are going on in our culture seem to stand as even a stronger apologetic to the need for Jesus Christ.
[time=3230] The need for Jesus Christ as our Savior. Society back in 1962 when they said we will no longer pray in our schools and since our country and our society publicly said we want God no more, we will have nothing to do with Him anymore.
[time=3244] And since 1962 the crime rates and the abuse rates and the suicide rates, all of those things have done nothing but escalate as we have said we will live without Christ.
[time=3256] Who was Jesus Christ? Well he claimed to be God and he was understood to be God by those who saw Him. He proved he was God by living a perfect, sinless life.
[time=3264] He further proved he was God by defying all feats of nature, of health and even of death itself, not to mention his own resurrection.
[time=3273] And he stands ready to be your Savior.
[time=3277] He stands ready for you to acknowledge Him as King, as God, for you to acknowledge your own sin, for you to repent and come to a saving knowledge of the person of Christ.
[time=3287] Let's pray together.
[time=3307] I want to thank you for watching the Bible Hour today. I'm glad that you had an opportunity to meet our pastor's family.

[time=3381] And more than that is we tried to portray in those concerts the fact that Christ grew up, lived here for a time and then died and rose again for our sins.
[time=3391] That was a special message for us to let you know that you can accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3398] I hope if you've never done that, you might even do that just today. What a perfect time of the year it would be to accept Jesus Christ into your heart.
