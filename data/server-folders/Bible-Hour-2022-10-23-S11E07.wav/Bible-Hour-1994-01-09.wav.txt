[time=0] And we try to convince him it was a reason, but he'd always bring us around to giving us his definition of an excuse, and this is what it was.
[time=8] He'd always say an excuse is a thin skin of reason stuffed with baloney.
[time=24] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=30] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=33] Thank you for joining us.
[time=35] Speaking today is you pastor Tim Teder.
[time=37] His message today is entitled, "The Thin Skins of Reason." Our special music today will be provided by Kevin Rowe and Michelle Smeckens.
[time=54] Please join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=84] [MUSIC]
[time=114] Oh, burdens my iniquity, who heals me from within, who lifts my fall in life and sets
[time=139] me on my feet again.
[time=141] Who leads me like a shepherd when I'm not a stray, my lord, my god, my Jesus, the one
[time=157] I pray, O he is we, and pray to his glory, O he is we, and worthy of our praise.
[time=185] I stand in his presence of grace, and round him with worship and praise, O he is we, O he is we.
[time=209] Who gives me in my loneliness who fights me where I learn, who loves outside my broken
[time=225] heart till I let him in song, whose life he serves me honor, laid me for his throne,
[time=234] my lord, my god, my Jesus, my Savior and my own, O he is he, and pray to his glory,
[time=261] O he is we, and worthy of our praise, I stand in his presence of grace, and round him with
[time=277] worship and praise, O he is we, O he is we, O he is we,
[time=295] O he, O he, O he, O he, O the Almighty, O life where shall praise thy name in earth, and
[time=319] thy name in earth, and thy name in earth, and thy name in earth, and thy name in earth,
[time=344] [MUSIC - 290 seconds]
[time=645] Well, I'm very glad that you tuned into the Bible Hour today.
[time=648] I know during the month of January, we have some viewers that usually attend their own church, but are unable to attend because of the cold weather and the snow that accumulates in the state of Indiana.
[time=660] So if you're unable to get to your home church and you've joined us for the Bible Hour, we're really happy that you have done that.
[time=667] I got a number of letters this week that told of people who have that situation where they can't get to their home church and they wrote in and even asked for prayer requests and just a few minutes ago at Richard and Marge Meade and I sat and prayed for these special requests.
[time=683] So I want to encourage you again to write in and let us know that you're watching.
[time=688] That really helps us and it gives us great encouragement.
[time=691] It gives us the opportunity to pray for some of the needs that you might have.
[time=696] During the month of December, we talked about a year end project to raise some funds for new equipment.
[time=702] That equipment has been delivered to our Bible Hour studio and is being put together right now.
[time=707] And our engineers are learning how to use it and we will be integrating some of this new equipment into the production of the Bible Hour Ministry even beginning next week.
[time=718] We're very thankful to all of you that helped us financially and assisting us with the purchase of this new equipment.
[time=725] I want to talk a little bit today about the Founders Club.
[time=728] You've heard us mention it and you see at the close of the service that the Bible Hour is made possible basically because of Founders Club members.
[time=736] These are people that give about fifteen dollars a month to our ministry on a regular basis and it helps us purchase the airtime necessary to produce the Bible Hour.
[time=747] I also want to talk to you about a booklet that the Founders Club receive every other month.
[time=752] It's entitled Life Walk.
[time=754] What a great devotional booklet this is and I'd like to have you consider becoming a member of the Founders Clubs, especially so you could receive the Life Walk magazine.
[time=765] It's a daily devotional and each week has various themes.
[time=770] One of the themes is relationships and it says the key to a great relationship is to be a good friend.
[time=777] Some of the topics on Monday morning will be talking about soft words for a hard world and then on Tuesday try a little kindness and on Wednesday the doorway of humility.
[time=788] Thursday how to inherit the earth and Friday it takes patience to build patience.
[time=794] It doesn't take very long, it only takes about ten minutes to read through the scripture that is offered to you and then an explanation about the topic for that particular day but it'll be great encouragement for you.
[time=805] So why don't you consider becoming a member of the Founders Club and if you'd like to know more about how to become a Founders Club member and what that means, write and ask us today.
[time=816] I want to give you the address, you can just simply write to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State Boulevard, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=827] Once again just write and ask how you can become a Founders Club member and you can write to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=841] In just a few minutes we're going to go back to the live portion of our program with some more music from Kevin Rowe and then our message today is from our youth pastor Tim Teder.
[time=851] Our pastor Russell Moore is out in Arizona and is at a conference it's entitled a build conference and it's a conference to help lay leaders become better leaders in our church and we're looking forward to implementing this program in our church family.
[time=869] So we hope that you stay tuned for Tim Teder's message and it's a privilege again to bring you the Bible Hour.
[time=881] [MUSIC] I just come into a valley, one like I've never been before [MUSIC] I keep searching for a way out [MUSIC] Seems like bedlocks are on the door [MUSIC] Oh there must be another sunrise [MUSIC] Another sunset that I'll see [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] That the love he has for me [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] God sends me to my knees [MUSIC] Though my tears flow like a river [MUSIC] Yet in him there's sweet relief [MUSIC] There's no need to get discouraged [MUSIC] There's no need to talk, defeat [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] And the whole wide world will see [MUSIC] I was not the first one to come into this place [MUSIC] You see every child of God [MUSIC] This test he must face [MUSIC] That is here that God will mold you [MUSIC] But make you what you want to be [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] Just be patient, you will see [MUSIC] Now I'm standing on the mountain [MUSIC] Looking back, I can see [MUSIC] When I was in, I'd know it's a valley [MUSIC] Your strong hands were leading me [MUSIC] Oh, it's good to see the sunshine [MUSIC] And to taste sweet victory [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] That's the grazing gift to me [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] Though it sends me to my knees [MUSIC] Though my tears flow like a river [MUSIC] Yet in him there's sweet relief [MUSIC] There's no need to get discouraged [MUSIC] There's no need to talk, defeat [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] And the whole wide world will see [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] Though it sends me to my knees [MUSIC] Though my tears flow like a river [MUSIC] Yet in him there's sweet relief [MUSIC] There's no need to get discouraged [MUSIC] There's no need to talk, defeat [MUSIC] God will make this trial of blessing [MUSIC] And the whole wide world will see â™ª
[time=1050] (audience applauding)
[time=1064] - What's good to have you here today?
[time=1067] We've been experiencing a week of rather frigid weather and our pastor's been wise enough to be attending a conference down in Arizona this week where he's been enjoying a golf along with classes he's been attending and so forth.
[time=1083] But he returns this afternoon.
[time=1085] I'd love to be at the airport as he steps off the full plane at Fort Wayne International.
[time=1090] They don't give you those little covered tubes to walk into.
[time=1093] You just step out in the turbulence of the airport and he's gonna know the contrast.
[time=1097] So we'll be happy to have him back this evening.
[time=1100] Those of you that know me know that I don't do basketball.
[time=1107] Very few people in the last 12 years of my life have ever seen me pick up a basketball much less dribble or try to shoot the thing.
[time=1115] But it may be of some note to realize that I once did play when I was in junior high, I was on my basketball team.
[time=1123] I never once scored a point, but I played during the season kind of on and off.
[time=1127] And my coach, Coach Wilson, was one who enjoyed sports and really gave it all he had to try to teach us the rules of the game and teach us how to enjoy playing the game and to do it properly.
[time=1141] He was a stickler following his directions and doing what he said to do and when practice started you were supposed to be there on occasion.
[time=1148] I or someone else would show up a little bit late.
[time=1151] Or we'd do some other minor thing, you know, against his instruction and he'd always call us on it.
[time=1158] And if I'd show up late for practice he'd ask, "Why weren't you here on time?" And of course I always had a reason.
[time=1165] It might have been anything from, "Well, I had a knot in my tennis shoe, whatever I could think of at the moment, but there are always some reason I could give." And he would always ask a player when we'd give one of these reasons.
[time=1175] He'd ask, "Is that a reason or is that an excuse?" And we'd try to convince him it was a reason, but he'd always bring us around to giving us his definition of an excuse, and this is what it was.
[time=1185] He'd always say, "An excuse is a thin skin of reason stuffed with baloney." And he'd make us repeat it, so we got to learn that phrase quite well during the seasons of practice.
[time=1194] Yes, a thin skin of reason stuffed with baloney.
[time=1196] And then he'd give me about ten laps to run.
[time=1198] I never, never lettered in basketball, but I think I did receive a letter in running laps because I got to be very good at that.
[time=1204] The thin skin of reason stuffed with baloney, when I began to understand what he was saying and excuse, there's truth in that.
[time=1213] When we try to pass the blame, we try to cover up our misdeed, our wrongdoing, by having a show of an ear of something that kind of makes a little sense.
[time=1225] But when you look past that, you see that it's nothing more than worthless excuse.
[time=1232] All of us learn to give excuses.
[time=1234] No one has to teach us to get out of trouble.
[time=1237] We want to pass the responsibility on.
[time=1240] We don't want to be the one to be blamed for something.
[time=1243] As children, you might have a parent who insisted that you be at the supper table when it was ready to be eaten.
[time=1251] And if you were like me again, you'd find reasons to be away when it was supper time and show up late.
[time=1258] And your mom or dad might ask, "Why are you late?" And of course, we can always think of reasons.
[time=1264] There's always good reason to be late.
[time=1266] There might be that my friend Rick's tire was flat and I had to help him get it fixed.
[time=1271] Or we were headed down the road, mom.
[time=1273] And you know that Johnny, that kid that beat me up last week, that bully that you told me to stay away from, he was right in the middle of the road.
[time=1280] So we had to go the long way around to get home today.
[time=1283] Or maybe even try to pass the responsibility on to them by saying something to the extent, "Well, you know that watch you gave me for Christmas." It's not really working that well.
[time=1291] I thought I was getting here on time, but I just happened to be a little late.
[time=1295] We learn to give excuses.
[time=1297] I work with students and have had opportunity, even in the last couple years, to teach a high school class.
[time=1303] And it's interesting the reasons that students give are not training their homework in.
[time=1308] Now, some of them are very common reasons.
[time=1311] And anywhere from the dog ate it, which is probably the most, I don't know, said that often, we hear that excuse talked about.
[time=1319] But, you know, "Oh, I left it on my dresser at home." Well, "Oh, I thought it was due tomorrow." Or, "I didn't understand what you really wanted." Or, "My dad spilled coffee all over it." Or, "My mom accidentally threw it away." Or, "Here's a good one if you're teaching a Christian school." Well, you know, my family had to go to church, and I just didn't have time to do my homework.
[time=1336] They think somehow that's going to impress you.
[time=1338] Here are some of the more creative, memorable excuses that have actually been given by students, as reported by teachers.
[time=1345] One student said, "Well, my aunt Gretchen took it back to Germany with her." I didn't write it down because, well, I did it all in my head.
[time=1352] One student said, "My sister got mad at me, flushed it down the toilet." I liked this one.
[time=1357] Well, you know, we had a fire at our house last night.
[time=1360] When I tried to run back in to save my homework, the firemen stopped me.
[time=1364] Now, I'm sure that's the one thing on a student's mind, is their room and all their possessions are burning up.
[time=1370] "Oh, my homework. I've got to save that." Here, this one, I'm sure, has a ring of truth to it.
[time=1376] Well, my dad made me play Nintendo last night.
[time=1379] I just couldn't get to my homework.
[time=1382] Thin skins of reason stuck with baloney.
[time=1385] We make excuses to God.
[time=1387] No one really has to teach us how to do that.
[time=1389] We don't want to be blamed for our sins, for our misdeeds.
[time=1392] And so when God confronts us in an area of weakness, in an area of wrong, we want to explain that away.
[time=1399] But I want to tell you something, God's not impressed with my excuses.
[time=1403] God's not impressed with your excuses.
[time=1406] In fact, as we look, as we will look at some of the people in Scripture who made excuses to God, we find that God actually, of whores, hates the excuses that they made.
[time=1416] Now, this morning, I just want us to realize that I believe our lives can be lived more pleasing to God if we'll avoid some of these common excuses, some of these thin skins of reason that we tend to give when we are caught in our disobedience.
[time=1436] Let me just mention, I don't know how many we'll get through this morning, but let me just talk about some of the more common excuses that we give to God when we're caught in disobedience.
[time=1446] The first, I'll call the past the buck, excuse.
[time=1449] That's when we point the finger.
[time=1451] That's when we try to find a scapegoat.
[time=1453] That's when we attempt to blame anyone or anything else for our misdeeds.
[time=1459] Author Donald Carroll tells the story of his six-year-old son coming to him one day.
[time=1464] When giving him the following information, he said, "Dad, there's milk on the kitchen floor." "Well, there is, is there," the father replied, "and why is that?" "Well, it accidentally spilled." "Oh, I see," his dad said, "it spilled." Now, you don't suppose by any chance that you were there with the milk when it had this accident, and the son replied in a tone of weary exasperation, "Well, of course, that's how I know it's spilled." "I just thought you should know," and his son walked out of the room.
[time=1498] You know, it really wasn't my fault.
[time=1500] It had an accident.
[time=1501] I happened to be there and I thought you should know.
[time=1504] Now, you've probably heard some of these before.
[time=1507] Every time I hear them, though, it raises a chuckle inside of me, probably because I know how far I go to try to give reason sometimes for the things I do that are wrong, but this is the list of some of the reasons people have actually turned in written excuses that people have given to insurance companies to explain their accidents.
[time=1528] One person wrote, "Well, my accident was due to the road bending." It passed the buck.
[time=1533] It wasn't my fault, the road bent, and it caused me to have an accident.
[time=1537] Another person said, "Well, a pedestrian hit me and went under my car." Another car collided with mine without giving warning of its intentions.
[time=1547] Here in all of these, it's not my fault, it's something or somebody else that caused someone actually wrote, "An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my vehicle and vanished." The pedestrian had no idea which direction to run, so I ran over them.
[time=1564] One person wrote, "As I approached the intersection, a stop sign suddenly appeared in a place where no stop sign has ever appeared before.
[time=1572] I wasn't able to stop in time to avoid an accident." Or how about this?
[time=1576] The telephone pole was approaching fast.
[time=1579] I was attempting to swerve out of its path when it struck my front end.
[time=1583] I mean, you get the picture of this telephone pole moving so that you can't get out of its way.
[time=1588] Another person said, "I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and headed for the embankment." It was her fault.
[time=1598] There's one more.
[time=1599] I knocked over the man.
[time=1601] He admitted it was his fault, though, as he had been knocked down before.
[time=1605] You know, it's not my fault, it's someone else's.
[time=1609] And as Christians sometimes, we may give this past-the-buck excuse
[time=1615] when God confronts us, when we're caught in disobedience, and it might take form such as, well, you know, God, everybody else is doing that.
[time=1623] You know, I was with so-and-so, and they wanted to do that.
[time=1628] And I mean, I just kind of, you know, it was their choice.
[time=1632] Decision, I just went along with it.
[time=1636] Or when God confronts us, maybe in a business practice that is less than honest,
[time=1643] we may say, well, you know, it's company policy.
[time=1646] That's what I'm supposed to do.
[time=1648] I mean, it's my boss telling me these things.
[time=1651] Whatever form, whatever context, we like to pass the blame.
[time=1656] And I want to look at some examples in Scripture, and these are going to be, you know, some of these are going to be well-known examples.
[time=1661] But let's see how they use some of these excuse, thin-skin-reason techniques and trying to get out of the blame.
[time=1669] The first we find an excuse of the past-the-buck excuse.
[time=1673] This is actually the first kind of excuse that was ever used.
[time=1676] Genesis chapter 3, Adam and Eve, you know the story.
[time=1680] God has created the guard.
[time=1682] He's created the universe.
[time=1684] And on this earth, he's created a magnificent place with all kinds of creatures
[time=1691] and the vegetation.
[time=1692] And he's put a man and a woman, Adam and Eve, in this garden.
[time=1695] And giving them freedom and control over all that's done is that I want you to enjoy.
[time=1700] But there's one tree I don't want you to eat of.
[time=1704] And as we read, Genesis chapter 3, we find that they disobey.
[time=1709] And now, after their disobedience, they're ashamed, they're frightened, they're hiding from God.
[time=1714] But God confronts them in Genesis chapter 3, beginning with the last part of verse 11.
[time=1718] And he asks them, "Have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?" Now, the wheels of Adam's mind are turning at this point.
[time=1726] And I don't know how prepared he is to give an answer.
[time=1729] Certainly he knows God is going to confront him, but he's out with it.
[time=1735] And the man said, "You're right, God, I sinned." It was my fault.
[time=1739] No, he didn't say that.
[time=1741] The man said, "The woman that you put here with me, she gave some fruit from the tree, and I ate it, passed the buck." So God turns to the woman.
[time=1752] And the woman learning from Adam, God asked her, "What have you done?" She said, "Well, the serpent, the serpent deceived me, and so I ate."
[time=1764] Now, you know the story.
[time=1765] Was God impressed with their excuse?
[time=1767] I mean, did it stop him?
[time=1769] No.
[time=1770] As we read on, we see that God brought punishment to each, to Adam, to Eve, to the serpent because of each misdeed, the excuse that didn't make it with God.
[time=1779] And there's another example of the past, the buck excuse that is even, it's rather humorous, I think, in the next book of the Bible, Exodus chapter 32.
[time=1789] The context of this account is that Moses is up on the mountain in the presence of God,
[time=1795] receiving instruction, the laws of the Lord concerning how his people are to live.
[time=1800] And it's on this mountain that God inscribes in tablets of stone 10 commands by which the
[time=1808] people should live.
[time=1809] And Moses comes down from the mountain with these tablets of stone, and you're probably familiar with the story.
[time=1814] He enters the camp of the people and finds them in wild celebration, frantic worship of an idol,
[time=1821] a golden calf.
[time=1825] And in Exodus 32, beginning at verse 21, Moses approaches Aaron, who has been left kind of
[time=1831] in charge of things.
[time=1832] And Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you that led, that you led them into such great sin?" Aaron, for goodness' sake, I mean, did they threaten you?
[time=1843] Did they say they would kill you?
[time=1845] I mean, what did they do that caused you to lead them in such great sin?
[time=1848] Now, here are the excuses of Aaron.
[time=1850] Notice, he doesn't want to take responsibility for himself.
[time=1852] He's going to point, first of all, at the people.
[time=1854] He said, "Well, do not be angry, my Lord," Aaron answered.
[time=1857] "You know how prone these people are to evil." And they said, "Make us gods who will go before us." And now he almost even in a subtle way tries to shift some of the blame to Moses.
[time=1870] And the people said, "As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't even know what has happened to him." It seems to be saying, "Moses, you know, you kind of took off and you weren't around, so what was I supposed to do?" Here's where it gets a little funny.
[time=1883] So I told them, "Hey, whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off." And so they gave me the gold.
[time=1889] I threw it in the fire and out came this calf.
[time=1892] Yeah, I just threw it in there and out came this golden cow.
[time=1895] And now, you know, here we are.
[time=1897] I just happened, I mean, the same unbelievable that you go into your kid's room and say, "Who messed up this room?" "Well, I don't know because I just walked out here a minute going.
[time=1906] It was sure clean.
[time=1907] I walked back in.
[time=1908] This is how it happened." Aaron makes excuses.
[time=1913] He doesn't accept the blame.
[time=1914] He passes the buck.
[time=1915] And again, God's not impressed.
[time=1918] As we read, we see that judgment comes on the people because of their sin.
[time=1922] And on this day, 3,000 people die.
[time=1925] The excuse doesn't matter.
[time=1926] You know, because remember now, what is an excuse?
[time=1931] Coach Wilson said, "Excuse is what?" Then skin of reason stuffed with baloney.
[time=1939] We may think on the outside, well, I've got it all explained, but worthless inside.
[time=1945] And that's how God sees it.
[time=1946] God sees past all of that.
[time=1947] He knows.
[time=1949] Let me give you another typical excuse.
[time=1952] This is what I call the "it's too hard" excuse.
[time=1955] Common uses among Christians might be, "Well, you know, I've failed so many times before.
[time=1960] I mean, I just can't do what God's calling me to do." I'm going to leave the hard stuff up to the professionals.
[time=1965] That's what we hire pastors to do.
[time=1967] That's what the elders are for.
[time=1968] That's what my teacher can do.
[time=1970] But I mean, it's too hard for me.
[time=1971] I mean, I've never had an education.
[time=1973] I've never been a seminary.
[time=1975] I've never had an official Bible training.
[time=1977] I don't know enough.
[time=1978] It's just too hard.
[time=1980] And I'm so busy.
[time=1982] I'm tired.
[time=1983] And to do what probably God wants me to do, it takes too much energy.
[time=1987] It's too difficult.
[time=1988] Or maybe it's excuse.
[time=1989] I'm not filling the blank enough.
[time=1991] And you have to put your own word there.
[time=1993] Maybe you would say, "I'm not talented enough." Or, "I'm not smart enough.
[time=1996] I'm not strong enough.
[time=1997] I'm not respected enough." It's too hard excuse.
[time=2004] There are some men in the book of Numbers that we read about Numbers 13 who gave it's too hard excuse.
[time=2014] God is ready to take his people into the land.
[time=2017] He promised them.
[time=2018] He promised them that he would give them the land of Canaan.
[time=2020] And he told them, "You are to go in and take possession of it." But before you do it, look at Numbers 13 and verse 2.
[time=2030] He tells Moses, "Send some men to explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the Israelites." And so you know the story.
[time=2036] Moses selected a man from each of the tribes.
[time=2038] 12 men went in, spent 40 days investigating the land.
[time=2042] And they came back to give their report.
[time=2044] Numbers 13, beginning at verse 27.
[time=2047] They gave Moses this account.
[time=2049] "We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey." Here's an example of the fruit.
[time=2056] But the people who live there are powerful.
[time=2059] And the cities are fortified and very large.
[time=2061] We even saw the descendants of Anak there.
[time=2063] And the Amalekites live in the Negev, and the Hittites, the Jebusites, and the Amorites live in the hill country.
[time=2068] And the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.
[time=2071] In other words, they're saying, "Moses, come on.
[time=2073] Sure, the land's great, but there are too many people there and they're too powerful for us.
[time=2078] It's too hard." I don't care what God says to do, we can't do it.
[time=2082] They made excuses.
[time=2084] It says then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, "We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it." We can do it.
[time=2094] But the men who had gone up with him said, "We can't attack those people, they are stronger than we are." They weren't willing to do what God told them to do.
[time=2101] They focused in on the enormity of the problem instead of God's promise.
[time=2107] So they made a, "It's too hard excuse." I said, "We can't do it." And what was God's response?
[time=2115] Did the excuse make it with God?
[time=2117] God sent a whole generation of people back into the wilderness and said, "You will not enter the land that I've promised you because of your lack of faith, because of your disobedience." They're excused in an impressed God.
[time=2128] He saw through it.
[time=2129] He saw past their thin skin of reason for what it was.
[time=2134] Another common excuse, it's the, "I have a better idea excuse."
[time=2140] It's kind of excuse that goes on like this.
[time=2142] Well, God, here's what you call me to do.
[time=2144] Here's what you desire for my life.
[time=2146] Here's how I know you call us to serve you as Christians, but I've got a better idea.
[time=2151] God, first of all, why don't you just let me spend time getting my life, my family secure.
[time=2157] Let me build some financial security and get things all settled, and then sometime in the future, I'll be, I'll have more time, I'll have more resources to give back to you.
[time=2167] Doesn't that sound like a better idea, God?
[time=2169] If you can just wait around a while.
[time=2171] Or maybe it's something like, "Well, God, I know you call us to share Christ, to talk about the good news to people." But God, you know, I've got a better idea.
[time=2181] Well, I think I'll just live a life that is such a good example that somehow people will be impressed by that.
[time=2187] But I don't want to talk about God or talk about Jesus, because then that might offend somebody.
[time=2192] So let me just be a silent witness.
[time=2194] Don't you think that's a better idea?
[time=2196] And we give excuses.
[time=2199] Just like King Saul did on a couple of occasions.
[time=2203] Just look at one in 1 Samuel, chapter 15.
[time=2207] God had given the instruction to King Saul through the
[time=2213] prophet, priest, Samuel.
[time=2216] He was supposed to go and to wipe out the Amalekites.
[time=2220] In 1 Samuel 15, we read about it in the first two verses.
[time=2224] God is speaking, said, "I will punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they way laid them as they came out from Egypt." Now go, speaking to Saul, go attack the Amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them.
[time=2237] Do not spare them.
[time=2238] Put to death men and women and children and infants, cattle and sheep and camels and donkeys.
[time=2244] In other words, everything is to be wiped out.
[time=2247] This is a total judgment.
[time=2249] You need to leave nothing living.
[time=2251] So Saul and his army set out.
[time=2254] They attacked the Amalekites.
[time=2255] But instead of destroying everything as God had commanded, the king, prisoner, and he also kept the good sheep and cattle.
[time=2263] The next day, Samuel goes to Saul and we pick up the story in verse 13.
[time=2268] And he said, "When Samuel reached him, Saul said to Samuel, "The Lord bless you, I have carried out the Lord's instructions." But Samuel said, "Well, then what is this bleeding of the sheep in my ears?
[time=2281] And what is this lowing of the cattle that I hear?" So Saul answered, and here's the thin skin of reason.
[time=2288] Well, the soldiers brought them from the Amalekites.
[time=2291] They spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord's your God.
[time=2295] Don't you think that's a good idea, Samuel?
[time=2297] I kept them.
[time=2298] We totally destroyed the rest of them, but we kept the best so that we could offer them as sacrifice.
[time=2303] Don't you think that was?
[time=2304] I know God said destroy everything, but don't you think this is a better idea?
[time=2308] And God didn't think it was a better idea.
[time=2312] Samuel said to Saul, "Because you have done this, God has rejected you as king, and another will be chosen in your place." God, if we say we have a better idea, and we offer that as an excuse,
[time=2326] God sees it for what it is, a thin skin of reason, but it's worthless.
[time=2334] How about this?
[time=2335] It's another excuse.
[time=2336] The "I'm not so bad" excuse.
[time=2339] All right, you caught me, but listen, I'm not so bad.
[time=2342] A few years ago, the mayor of Washington, D.C., tried to put a good face on the hundreds of shootings
[time=2349] and stabbings and other murders that were taking place in the nation's capital, and when he was asked about these things, he explained with this comment.
[time=2358] He said, "Outside of the killings, we have one of the lowest crime rates in the country."
[time=2365] As like saying, "Well, outside of the fact that I beat my wife every night, I don't treat her too bad."
[time=2373] Oh, we try to do that.
[time=2374] Yeah, well, okay, I mean, you're right, I have this problem.
[time=2377] But, I mean, on the whole, I mean, look over here, I've got a lot of good things.
[time=2380] I'm really not so bad.
[time=2382] And in our Christianity, these excuses might come out in terms like, "I'm not so bad, I'm not as bad as so-and-so." I mean, we can always look around the church and find someone that's a little worse trouble than we are.
[time=2394] I'm not as bad as them.
[time=2396] Well, after all, God, I mean, you should be impressed.
[time=2398] I'm in church, you know, most every week.
[time=2401] I mean, religion is important to me.
[time=2404] I mean, I don't want to take it too seriously, but it is important to me.
[time=2408] And when you consider the world as a whole, I mean, the bad shape the world is, and you look at all the junk going on around us, I don't look too bad.
[time=2417] I'm not so bad.
[time=2420] I just don't want to take things too seriously.
[time=2422] I had a student I was talking to this past week.
[time=2425] We were talking about Christianity, we were talking about the call of Christ in our life, and what it means to be a follower of Jesus.
[time=2431] And he stopped me at one point, and he said, "You know, you baptists.
[time=2433] You take things so seriously." I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "Well, you just make this, you know, Christianity, it's like it's every day something, and you have to be serious about it all the time." And I tried to help him understand, "Well, that's not a baptist thing.
[time=2449] That's just a Jesus thing.
[time=2451] That's what he said when he described being a disciple.
[time=2454] It's not a denomination.
[time=2456] It's what Jesus taught.
[time=2457] And I don't want to make it sound like I'm talking about some legalistic system that, you know, every day I have to get up and go through my checklist and make sure I do all those things, and that's what being a Christian is.
[time=2467] I think some people, when they think Baptists, that's what they think of me, or us.
[time=2471] But on the other hand, the call of Christ is a call to come every day and to serve Him,
[time=2477] and to follow Him.
[time=2479] And it's not to weigh ourselves to see, "Well, yeah, I've got these bad things, but those can be excused because I have enough good stuff on this side of the account."
[time=2490] Jesus wants to open those rooms of our life, too, and to deal with the issues of disobedience and sin, and not to excuse them away.
[time=2497] In fact, Jesus said that there's going to be a group of people one day who stand before Him, and their expectation is that they're going to be led in to be part of the Kingdom of God.
[time=2505] That's what they fully expect.
[time=2507] And God is going to say to them, "I never knew you." And they're going to have an excuse.
[time=2513] And their excuse is that it's an "I'm not so bad" excuse.
[time=2517] Matthew chapter 7, verses 21 and following, Jesus said, "Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord will enter the Kingdom of Heaven, but only He who does the will of my Father who is in Heaven." Many will say to me on that day, there will many be many who believe that they're ready to enter into the Kingdom.
[time=2535] Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, didn't we prophesy in your name?
[time=2539] Didn't we drive out demons? Didn't we even perform miracles?" I mean, we did good things!
[time=2544] And Jesus said, "I will say to them plainly." There will be no question about this. It will be very plain.
[time=2550] "I never knew you away from me, you evil doers." You see, you can't justify a lifestyle and a pattern of disobedience to God by saying, "Yeah, but I do these good things." God desires a heart that belongs to Him.
[time=2563] A heart that has a passion to know God and to do what He wants me to do,
[time=2569] wants you to do.
[time=2570] And we struggle through that.
[time=2572] And yes, we sin, but the desire of our heart is to serve Him.
[time=2578] And God realizes our excuses for what they are, just thin skins of reason stuffed with baloney.
[time=2587] Here's another one.
[time=2588] It's what I call the "I have more important things" excuse.
[time=2592] This excuse may sound something like this.
[time=2595] You know, I have to provide for my family.
[time=2598] And that keeps me kind of busy.
[time=2601] I mean, that's a responsibility I have.
[time=2603] I mean, God's even given me that responsibility.
[time=2605] And so, I don't have time for some of these other things.
[time=2608] I've got to do that.
[time=2610] Or my job just keeps me so busy, God, I can't do this or that.
[time=2614] You know what God gives us those responsibilities and expects me to be responsible my wife and to my children to help provide for my family.
[time=2623] He expects me to do my job and my work to the best of my ability, but not to sacrifice obedience to Him by doing those things.
[time=2633] Those are never an excuse for being disobedient to God.
[time=2637] For not doing what He calls me to do.
[time=2643] Look at Luke chapter 14.
[time=2647] Jesus is teaching about the Kingdom of God and he gives us a parable.
[time=2656] Luke chapter 14, beginning with verse 16.
[time=2661] Jesus said a certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests.
[time=2667] At the time of the banquet He sent His servant to tell those who had been invited come for everything is now ready.
[time=2673] Now, in this story, as we read the context, it's very obvious Jesus is talking about the invitation of God to be part of His Kingdom.
[time=2681] But the invitation went out and we read the next verse.
[time=2684] They all alike began to make excuses.
[time=2686] The first said, "Well, I've just bought a field.
[time=2688] I must go see it.
[time=2689] Please excuse me." Another said, "Well, I've just bought five yoke of oxen.
[time=2692] I'm on my way to try them out.
[time=2693] Please excuse me." Still, another said, "Well, I just got married so I can't come." I mean, they all had important things to do.
[time=2699] Social responsibilities, business responsibilities, family responsibilities.
[time=2703] Did the excuses make it?
[time=2706] Go on to read.
[time=2708] The servant came back and reported this to his master.
[time=2710] Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant.
[time=2713] Go out quickly into the streets and allys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, the lame.
[time=2719] Sir, the servant said, "What you ordered has been done, but there is still room." Then the master told the servant, "Go out to the roads and the country lanes and make them come in so that my house will be full." I tell you, not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.
[time=2732] The ones who made an excuse will not get a taste.
[time=2736] Their excuses didn't matter.
[time=2739] I have more important things to do.
[time=2741] Jesus said they're left out of the banquet.
[time=2744] There's no place at the table for them.
[time=2747] God recognizes those excuses for what they're.
[time=2749] Let me just mention one more.
[time=2751] We'll call this the personal weakness excuse.
[time=2754] The excuse that says, "That's just who I am.
[time=2758] You have to understand that it's just part of me." You may remember it made national news when the Beverly Hills policeman, Paul Kramer, ticketed Jaja Gabor for having expired license plates on the back of her Rolls Royce.
[time=2772] She responded to him by slapping him in the face.
[time=2777] When asked why she would do such a thing, here was her explanation.
[time=2783] "Well, I am Hungarian.
[time=2785] We are descendants of Genghis Khan and Attila the Hun.
[time=2789] We are Hungarian freedom fighters." So that explains it.
[time=2795] I mean, it's just part of my nature.
[time=2798] It's just, "How could I help myself?
[time=2800] That's who I am." So maybe a personal weakness.
[time=2804] In the church we hear this when people say, "Well, you know, I know maybe that's a sin, but it's part of my personality." Some even make it more spiritual by saying, "It's just my thorn in the flesh." And somehow that God's caused me to be this way, to have this sin because he wants to keep me humble.
[time=2824] So you'll have to excuse it because I'm sure he does.
[time=2827] Or, "I'm this way because my parents were this way." It's much like the people in his equal chapter 18 who were complaining to God, "Why are you judging us?
[time=2837] You're punishing us for something that was our parents' fault.
[time=2840] They ate the sour grapes," they said.
[time=2842] And our teeth are set on edge.
[time=2843] And God rebuked them and said, "How dare you say that?" God said, "The soul that sins is the one that will die.
[time=2849] I judge your parents for their sins.
[time=2851] I will judge you for your sins.
[time=2853] If you live a life of righteousness, you will live.
[time=2858] But don't try to blame your parents.
[time=2860] You're responsible for your own life.
[time=2862] Yes, my parents have had a big effect, an impact on my life.
[time=2866] Yes, I have tendencies, I believe, for certain sins or weaknesses, because I grew up with parents who were imperfect and learned patterns after them.
[time=2876] But that no way excuses me." Some will even say, "Well, you know what?
[time=2882] My sin is really a disease.
[time=2884] It's genetic." And I'm not going to try to explain the science of everything.
[time=2889] I'll agree with you.
[time=2891] I believe.
[time=2893] Even physically, even genetically, you may have more of a propensity to certain sins.
[time=2898] You may have more inclination to certain temptations than I have, and I have to others than you.
[time=2904] And the Bible is very clear that we will struggle in this lifetime with tendencies and desires to sin.
[time=2909] Even as Christians, we carry on habits of sinfulness in our life.
[time=2913] But that is not an excuse.
[time=2915] Nowhere in Scripture do you find that as an excuse to indulge in disobedience, to live in sin.
[time=2922] In fact, it's very interesting.
[time=2924] Romans 8, verse 9, Paul writes the Romans.
[time=2928] He says, "You, however, are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the Spirit.
[time=2934] And if the Spirit of God lives in you, if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ." And a couple of verses later, he says, "Therefore, brothers, we have an obligation.
[time=2944] But it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it.
[time=2947] For if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die.
[time=2950] But if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live because those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God." In other words, Paul is saying that's not a little gentleman excuse for the Christian because you have a power in your life that is greater than those tendencies to sin.
[time=2966] That's what the Spirit of God does in us.
[time=2968] He gives us the ability to live a life that is not given to sin.
[time=2977] He not only sets us free from the penalty, but sets us free from sin's power in our life.
[time=2981] Now some may say, "Wait a second, Ted, or you skip the whole chapter.
[time=2987] Look at chapter 9." I mean, in chapter 7 of Romans and chapter 7, Paul talks about the struggle.
[time=2993] Paul actually says, "You know, the good things I want to do, I can't do.
[time=2997] What's this going on?
[time=2998] Here's the things that I want.
[time=3000] I try to, but I find that the sin inside of me just makes me do the wrong stuff." I mean, that sounds like that's pretty good reason.
[time=3006] It sounds like he's saying it's not my fault.
[time=3008] It's just the sin inside me because I really want to do the good thing.
[time=3011] But folks, you understand, you read what Paul is writing about in Romans.
[time=3015] He's talking about the place of God's law in our life.
[time=3018] And Paul is making the argument that when it comes to the law of God, the instruction, the commands of God, the law of God is good, but it cannot save us.
[time=3026] In fact, what the law does is it frustrates us and it shows our imperfections.
[time=3031] And Paul is saying in Romans, chapter 7, he says, "You know, when I studied the law and I looked at the law, I wanted to obey it.
[time=3036] I wanted to follow it.
[time=3037] I wanted to live it.
[time=3038] But when I tried, I could not." And he comes to the end of chapter 7, he says, "What a wretched man.
[time=3043] What a miserable man I am.
[time=3045] Who will rescue me from this body of death?" And he gives the answer in the last verse of chapter 7.
[time=3051] He says, "Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord." Now, that's just not some quick, easy answer that, you know, I used to struggle with sin, but now all of a sudden Jesus somehow comes my life and I never struggle with sin anymore.
[time=3064] I don't believe that's what Paul is saying.
[time=3066] But he is saying that there is a solution.
[time=3068] There is an answer.
[time=3069] There is never a cause for us to give the excuse, though so-called reason, that I couldn't help myself.
[time=3076] I had to sin because it's part of my nature.
[time=3078] Paul is saying through Jesus Christ, you are recreated.
[time=3081] The Spirit of God lives in you.
[time=3084] And in the very heart of hearts, in the very center of you now, God is recreating you and part of that is giving you the desire to do what's right and the ability to do what's right.
[time=3093] And you never have the excuse of saying, "I couldn't help myself." In fact, Peter writes in one of his letters, he says that God has given you everything you need to live a life of godliness.
[time=3104] Or without excuse.
[time=3107] I mean, what does God think of our excuses?
[time=3109] Then, skins of reason.
[time=3113] Let me just make a few final observations when we consider the excuses of our life.
[time=3120] When we're caught in disobedience.
[time=3122] One thing I'd encourage you to realize is that your excuses, my excuses, probably tend to draw greater attention to our sins, especially to the people around us.
[time=3131] When I'm constantly making excuses for my sinfulness, I don't know if that even presses the people that I'm making excuses to other than God.
[time=3138] I think it draws more attention when I try to cover them up many times.
[time=3143] When I was in junior high, I had a pair of jeans that I wore them, one of my favorite pair of jeans.
[time=3149] I wore them a lot.
[time=3150] Because I wore them a lot, they got a little snag on the back pocket, a little hole that just began to unravel a little bit.
[time=3155] You couldn't see it.
[time=3156] It didn't bother me, but it bothered my mom.
[time=3158] She was afraid that it would catch on something or it would be unsightly.
[time=3161] My mom decided to cover that hole with a patch.
[time=3165] She ironed on a patch, a big patch that looked like a band-aid on the back of my favorite jeans.
[time=3172] Forget it, I'm not wearing those things anymore.
[time=3174] I'm not walking around with a big band-aid back there that everybody can see.
[time=3178] Because in my mom's effort to cover over an obvious flaw, she drew more attention to it.
[time=3185] Sometimes in our excuses, we do the same thing.
[time=3189] Another thing I think we should realize is that God desires your honesty and my honesty.
[time=3194] Pure and simple.
[time=3196] Pure and simple honesty is what God wants.
[time=3199] Matthew 537, Jesus is speaking.
[time=3202] He says you don't need to go into these big oaths and say I swear by this or that or the other thing that I'm telling the truth.
[time=3210] Jesus said you were to be characterized by people who are so honest, filled with such integrity that your yes means yes and your no means no.
[time=3216] That's what he said, simply let your yes be yes and your no be no.
[time=3220] That's simple.
[time=3222] Whether we're responding to people, whether we're responding to God, our responses should be honest responses of yes or no.
[time=3229] No, but I've got a good reason for it or yes, but I can explain that just yes or no.
[time=3236] I mean God knows our hearts anyway.
[time=3240] As I grew up, my parents would mention one of those phrases that would always bother me and I'd always say I'll never say that to my own kids and now I find myself saying it to my own children.
[time=3253] When I would begin to make an excuse, no excuses just do it.
[time=3258] When I find myself to my own child, I don't want no excuses, just do it.
[time=3263] And you know what I think God in the same sort of way when we begin to give our thin skins of reason.
[time=3269] I think God's response to us says hey, I see past all that.
[time=3274] I don't need to hear excuses.
[time=3276] You're my child. I just want you to obey.
[time=3279] Just do it.
[time=3281] I can't see into your life. I don't know what may be those things that you're making excuses for.
[time=3290] It may be that there is something in your life that you have not yet dealt with.
[time=3296] Some sin that God has pointed out and you continue to make excuses.
[time=3300] God wants you to stop making excuses.
[time=3303] Maybe something that God has called you to do, an act of obedience that you have just kept putting off.
[time=3308] Maybe one of these excuses you keep using.
[time=3310] God simply wants us to obey out of a desire of devotion and love for Him.
[time=3315] Just obey.
[time=3317] And I need to stop making excuses.
[time=3319] You need to stop making excuses and live a life of simple, honest obedience to God.
[time=3327] Father, thank you this morning that you remind us.
[time=3331] Through examples and scripture of men and women who didn't just live perfect godly lives,
[time=3337] but god we even see their inadequacies. We see their weaknesses. We see their failures.
[time=3340] We see their excuses.
[time=3343] And god you teach us through those how you look at that.
[time=3348] And god help me to be a man who stops making excuses, help us to be a church and people who stop
[time=3354] giving justifications and reasons, finger pointing for the things that we do that are wrong.
[time=3360] God help us to be willing to be different, to be set apart, to be so honest and filled with such integrity in life that we're willing to take the risk to follow you and to obey no matter what it costs without excuse.
[time=3375] Please buy your spirit work in our hearts to give us that desire.
[time=3379] I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[time=3395] I hope you received a blessing from the music today from our sanctuary choir,
[time=3414] Kevin Rowe and soloist Michelle Smackens.
[time=3417] The message was from our youth pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=3421] If you as a result of this program decided to accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior, I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you. You can pray right where you are.
[time=3430] Let's pray together.
[time=3432] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3439] Today I have a need for Christ to come into my heart.
[time=3441] I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my savior today.
[time=3446] In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=3450] If you prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
