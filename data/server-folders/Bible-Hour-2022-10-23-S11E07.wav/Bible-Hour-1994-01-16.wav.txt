[time=799] [APPLAUSE]
[time=819] Thank you, Susan and Scott. Beautifully, beautifully done. Well, let's take our Bibles this morning
[time=825] and come to the book of Philippians. We return to a study that we have there in the fourth
[time=832] chapter, Philippians chapter four, and it's a familiar text of Scripture to most of us
[time=838] who have been in the church any length of time, verses four through nine. It's all about anxiety and stress. Verse six really is the centerpiece of this passage. "Be anxious
[time=849] for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your
[time=855] requests be made known to God." It's the kind of passage that is devoted itself to application
[time=863] in our Christian life, and that's not true of all passages of Scripture in the Word of God. Some passages you could go to are primarily educational, they'll teach us something about the nature of God, something about the incarnation of Christ, and while there may be secondary
[time=878] application in our life, it's really information that God wants to give us in some of these passages. In others, we'll find passages that are purely motivational. They are there to encourage us and keep us motivated and keep us fixing our hope on the future, and the Lord is trying to motivate us in some of those. We could find other passages in the Word of God that lay a pattern down for the church. We might look at the book of 1 Timothy, for
[time=903] example, and while there is some application there personally, much of what we find there is about the church and how to order the church and how to structure the church. But when
[time=913] you come to this passage, this passage has got a bullseye on your heart. This is going to go directly into your life, and you know that because it's punctuated with six particular
[time=925] kind of verbs. They're called imperative verbs, which are commands in the Greek, and when you read it in the Greek, they just stand out like neon lights as you run your eyes across the page, and it's all about giving specific, personal, intimate instruction to the believer
[time=940] on how to handle one particular issue in their life, stress and anxiety, that whole concept
[time=946] of stress and anxiety, the flip side of that same coin, how to know the peace of God in your life, how to really walk in the peace of God. And frankly, I wish we could spend
[time=957] a half a year on a passage like this and just go over it and over it and over it because the truth is so fundamental and it's so relevant and it makes such a huge difference in a person's
[time=968] life that you're reluctant to move on until you have a feeling that 85% of us understand
[time=974] and are living it. I wish we could break up into small groups and compare our lives to the truth of this text and really examine our own values against the value of the text and then look at application and just get this down. This happens to have been the very first sermon I ever prepared. This text was the text upon which I built my first sermon.
[time=995] I was in sermon prep class in seminary and the prof was handing out different texts to
[time=1001] different people for our very first sermon and this one came to me. And so it's been
[time=1007] a text that has been on my heart since I was beginning the process of trying to study God's Word in someone in an official manner. Most of the passages in my memory and over and over
[time=1018] and over again in my life I returned to it and just go through the principles that are in it. And so it's a marvelous thing to know that while some passages are purely educational,
[time=1028] others motivational, others a pattern for the church, this one is for us. This one God wants to see impact our life in a significant way. As you remember, we've defined anxiety
[time=1040] as a brooding fear over some future contingency. There's something out there. Whether it's a job or a health thing or something with a spouse or a financial complication, there's some contingency out in our future. We don't know exactly how it's going to turn out and
[time=1056] from our vantage point it may turn out just the way we like it or it may turn out the opposite of the way we like it and all the consequences that could come with that. Anxiety are the feelings that we have about that future contingency. God has made us with self-awareness
[time=1072] and imagination and creativity and we can project our mind out there in the future and see that contingency and even begin to feel some of the feelings that might be in us were
[time=1083] it to go one way or the other. And so we can actually almost live there and feel the stress and the anxiety that would come with it going the wrong way. God has given us that marvelous
[time=1094] capacity. And so he has to instruct us how to handle that reality in our life, stress
[time=1100] and anxiety over a future contingency. As we've noted, this anxiety is not purely a mental
[time=1109] thing and it's not purely an emotional thing because of the way God put us together, the tentacles of anxiety and stress reach into every dimension of our life. Kenneth Peltier
[time=1119] in his article, which I mentioned previously, mind as healer, mind as slayer says this, medical
[time=1125] and psychological problems caused by stress have become the number one health problem in the last decade. One standard medical text estimates that 50 to 80 percent of all diseases
[time=1136] have their origin in stress. Stress can alter a person's brain wave activity, endocrine
[time=1142] and immunological balance, blood supply and pressure, respiration rate and pattern and digestive processes. Now folks, that problem reaches far into our life and so it's little
[time=1155] wonder that the Lord would give us an entire passage devoted to our understanding and dealing with that in very productive ways. It begins in verse 4, rejoice in the Lord always. Again,
[time=1166] I say rejoice. The command here is to rejoice. It's coupled with an absolute, the word always,
[time=1172] which means that there is never a situation in which we are not supposed to rejoice. And
[time=1178] while some have misunderstood this text and taught it to mean that we are rejoicing in the Lord, which is to say, I'm so infatuated with my relationship with Christ, I'm so in love with Christ that the circumstances of my life don't even matter to me. Which really
[time=1193] I think is far from the meaning of this text. It's almost, that would almost be promoting some type of Christian denial. You'll notice in the life of our Lord, He was very aware of His circumstances. At times He wept, at times His gut was rinsed with compassion.
[time=1208] Jesus didn't walk around this earth so infatuated with Himself or His heavenly Father that He
[time=1214] failed to notice, mention or be impacted by the circumstances of His life. In fact, the Lord said, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. The truth is another
[time=1224] word for reality. You'll be able to embrace all of reality and in that embracing and because
[time=1230] I'm part of that reality, meaning Christ Himself, you'll be free. So the Christian message isn't
[time=1236] some type of Christian denial where we get consumed with a relationship with the Lord and we almost are so heavenly minded that we're not even aware, we're numb to the reality
[time=1246] of day to day things. That would make us very impersonal and impractical. How could we minister to other people? How could we have compassion for them? How could we hurt with them when they hurt? That's not what this text means. That's not what that verse means. What this verse means is this, I can rejoice in the Lord always because I know my Lord is sovereign.
[time=1263] I know that the Lord is the sovereign ruler of my life and He knows about my future contingencies
[time=1269] and He knows them better than I can even imagine them and they cannot impact me negatively or positively outside of His sovereign control. That's how come I can rejoice in the Lord because my life is not made up of a series of chance events happenstance. Nobody knows, nobody's
[time=1286] in control. Who knows what life's going to bring? What will tomorrow be? That's not the reality of a believer. We live in a personal loving relationship with a sovereign Lord
[time=1296] who knows all the events of our life and sovereignly orchestrates them for His glory.
[time=1303] And we have the underlying assurance that not only will it result to His glory but that those events, whether they are difficult or pleasing, can be used in us to create a greater sense of dependency upon Him. What this demands is a central value which is the most important
[time=1320] value in the Christian's life out of which all other value judgments get made. The most important thing about my life is knowing and pursuing Christ. And you can see that. Chapter
[time=1331] 3 verse 8, what does Paul say? More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. When I have that as my central value
[time=1343] in my life and I know that the Lord is sovereign in all the events of my life, even if the future contingency turns out in a way I don't want it to from my own vantage point. It may not be the easiest, it may not have been the most pleasant, it may have been the loss of a child, the loss of a spouse, the loss of a job, financial ruin, and I wouldn't have voted for that in my case. But because I serve a sovereign Lord, I know it didn't happen by accident. I have a fundamental value in my life that those circumstances are able to promote my knowledge of Christ, my dependence upon Him, with that kind of knowledge I can
[time=1375] rejoice in any situation and any circumstance. So rejoice in the Lord always and again I
[time=1384] will say rejoice. That's step one. And that really, I mean you almost feel like you shut the book and say okay that's it, that's all I need to know. But the Lord moves into greater levels of understanding of how to deal with our anxiety and our stress. The second thing He says is in verse 5, look at it there. It says, "Let your forbearing spirit be known
[time=1402] to all men, the Lord is near." Survey the anxious times in your life. I think you will
[time=1410] find that in all of them there has been a personality involved. Whenever there's stress, whenever there's anxiety, nine times out of ten, it's not just you in a generic circumstance,
[time=1421] there's a person involved. There's another personality who has the power or has the ability
[time=1427] to manipulate that situation or even control that situation in ways you don't like. And
[time=1433] the Lord understands that. Our greatest problems aren't from circumstances, they are from people and dealing with people. And so He brings verse 5 to explain to us how to deal with the people involved in that anxious set of circumstances. What's He say, "Let be
[time=1447] known is the imperative to all men. Let your forbearing spirit be known to all men." That
[time=1454] also is all encompassing, it's an absolute that means everyone and anyone in your life is in this category. There isn't anybody in your life you don't need to allow a forbearing spirit to be known. We try to define a forbearing spirit because it's not a word we use very often. For bearing spirit is being willing to be taken advantage of. It talks about our
[time=1475] rights and contrary to the world in which we live and the culture in which we live, which
[time=1481] says basically, you've got to stand for your own rights and get what you deserve. The word
[time=1487] of God says to us, "Either stand for your rights or give your rights up, depend that not upon what you think you deserve, but that which brings glory to Christ, that which advances the cause of Christ." And so He gives us the counsel to look at the people in the stressful
[time=1504] situation, those who oppose us, those we may not agree with, those we wish didn't exist in this particular scenario, to look at them and say, "My rights are not the issue. I'll either stand for them or give them up, depend that upon how I think I can be used of God to promote godliness and Christ-likeness and the plan of God in this given situation." That's true not just in the church but in work as well, in the secular workplace as well. That is the heart, that is the attitude. And we looked at Paul in Acts chapter 16 and
[time=1535] we won't go there this morning. But we saw him in the same passage at one point giving his rights up, which meant that he got beaten and thrown in prison. All he had to do was declare he was a Roman citizen and the beating would have stopped because they hadn't tried him and you can't beat a Roman citizen without a proper trial. He never mentions that he's a Roman citizen. The mere mention of his lips and the whole process stops, no beating, no imprisonment, no stocks. He lets it go. He gives up his rights. While he is in that
[time=1561] prison he leads the Philippian jailer to the Lord. Then the city officials want to hustle Paul out of town quietly because they don't know what to do with him and he says, "No, I'm not leaving. I'm not just going to disappear from the town of Philippi. I happen to be a Roman citizen and I have rights." And if you follow the text you'll know he demanded his rights so that he could go to the homes of those who had already accepted Christ through his visit and he wanted to strengthen them. So the principle emerges, personal rights are to be given up or to be stood for not on the basis of our own desires but on the basis of how we think we can be used in the hand of God to propagate the gospel and strengthen people who are saved. So that's review. If you want more on that you can buy the tape.
[time=1610] Verse 6 brings us to new territory. It says this, "Be anxious for nothing." Now that's
[time=1616] the heart of the text and we need to say little about it because the text is all about this but I think it's worthy note this, here again we have an imperative verb, "Be anxious coupled with nothing," another absolute, "Don't be anxious for anything." And rather than viewing
[time=1631] this as some harsh standard that the Lord brings into our lives and he doesn't really
[time=1637] understand how hard it is for us and he's just putting our backs up against the wall and asking us to do the impossible when he says, "Be anxious for nothing." The inverse is actually true. What he's doing is this, he's saying no matter how hard your situation is, no matter how difficult the circumstances are and when you are tempted to think, "This
[time=1657] one's too tough. I've got to be anxious on this one. I've got to have strife on this one. This is just outside the parameters of this text." Verse 6 says, "Nothing is outside
[time=1667] the parameters of this text." No matter how severe the problem, no matter how difficult, no matter how severe the consequence is that may come to you, "Be anxious for nothing.
[time=1676] I am big enough to handle it all," is what he's saying. "I am big enough to understand it all. I am strong enough to be powerful for all of it and I will sovereignly work in all of the situations of your life." So rather than being a negative statement that makes us feel guilty, it is actually a liberating statement that lets us be reassured that there is nothing that can come into our life that he is not big enough to handle. Look at the
[time=1702] fourth one, also in verse 6, "The imperative is let be made known." That's the command
[time=1709] and of course he's talking about prayer. What's he say, "Be anxious for nothing but in everything
[time=1717] by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your request be made known to God." The
[time=1724] question immediately comes, "Why is he using so many different words for prayer?" We've got prayer, then we've got supplication, then we've got thanksgiving, and then we've got requests. Is he just being redundant? Is he just trying to emphasize this or is there something practical in here for how I'm supposed to pray? And I believe in the latter, sometimes
[time=1745] he does just use words for emphasis. Other times there seems to be a sequence and a flow and I think that's the case here. Let me give you four definitions for these words and you see if it doesn't make sense to you. The first word is prayer and it's the broadest, most common term for prayer in the New Testament and it simply means to open up the lines of communication with God. Prayer is just a general term of communicating with God. It's like dialing the phone and you've got him on the line. The lines are open now and I know with God they're always open but for the sake of understanding. It's just opening the lines of communication, supplication. It's a different word altogether and it has the flavor of
[time=1782] a dependent humble heart. It's used to describe the humble cry of dependence as the Christian
[time=1791] cries out for help from his God. The third word, thanksgiving, needs a little definition.
[time=1798] Thanksgiving is thanksgiving, say thank you. But the question is say thank you for what?
[time=1802] Well remember, we're talking about a future contingency. We're talking about something we don't know the outcome of it yet. And I believe the text is indicating that we in advance in the knowledge of God's sovereignty thank him for whichever way it's going to turn out. We praise him. We say God, it's up to you and in advance, I'll thank you for it because I know you're in charge. I know you have my best interest at heart. And so before I even know how it works out, I'm going to say thank you for the outcome. The last
[time=1829] word is request. Again, a totally different word and it means this. Specific petition.
[time=1836] It means, and you know this from your study other places in the New Testament, God is
[time=1842] really interested to know what's on your particular heart. God is interested in hearing you pray specifically about specific issues in your life. And Romans 8 tells us, when you can't even find the words to give utterance to the feelings in your heart, the Holy Spirit will intercede and express them for you. God is not. God doesn't look at you as some generic
[time=1863] project. He really is interested in your life, your details, your struggle, your trauma and the situation you're dealing with. And so the idea then is to have the opportunity
[time=1874] and the privilege and the mandate to say, but Lord, if it could work out this way, this is how I like it and then specifically list that out for him. Let me try to put it in the context of an illustration. Somebody's lost their job. The breadwinner in a home,
[time=1888] the dad, has lost his job and he's lost it for a long time. And the future contingency is, will I find a new job before our resources run out? Or am I going to have to sell my
[time=1900] house and sell my cars and all the other things that go with that? And he's faithfully and
[time=1907] diligently doing everything in his power to try to find a job, but the future contingency looms and it's big in its impact in his life and the life of his kids. How's the guys
[time=1918] supposed to handle that? Verse six, be anxious for nothing. Hey, good news. This is all within God's ability to handle. We're not on some extracurricular activity that God is knowing about. How's he supposed to pray? How's he supposed to pray? In everything by prayer,
[time=1936] certainly open the lines of communications with God. Come to him in supplication. Let him hear the humble cry of dependence of your heart. Come to him in humility and say, God, I can't orchestrate the events of my life. I can do what I can do, but I need your help.
[time=1950] I am not some self-sustaining, self-sufficient, autonomous individual. You're the creator.
[time=1955] I'm the creature. I need your help. What's the third word? Thanksgiving. But by the way,
[time=1961] God, I trust you. And however you work this out, if it includes the sale of my home and
[time=1969] the sale of my cars and the absolute depletion of any assets I may have saved to this point, God, I know you know what's best for me and what's best for your glory, and I'll thank you for that in advance. There's no strings on my relationships with you, God. I'll praise you and thank you in advance for however you choose to leave my life. Now, here comes a good part. Requests. But, Lord, if it could work this way, you know our situation. We
[time=1994] got two more months before we're out of cash. I need a job, Lord. And there is that guy
[time=2000] over there I've interviewed with, God, open his heart. If that's your will, please give him mercy and let him hire me so that we don't have to go through this. See, he wants
[time=2010] to hear that, too. He really wants to hear that. It's good for you to say it to him.
[time=2016] So a practical passage gets even more practical when we come to the issue of prayer, a specific way of praying through the anxious times. Now, the passage kind of takes a break in verse
[time=2028] 7. There's no imperative verb in verse 7. It's just kind of a comment. Look at it. "And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." What he's saying is, verse 4, "If you will join us in the Lord, trust in my sovereignty." Verse 5, "If you'll treat others with the interests of the kingdom
[time=2050] in mind and be willing to give your rights up or stand for them depending upon what you think best advances the kingdom. If you'll trust that no circumstances outside my perusal
[time=2060] be anxious for nothing and if you'll begin to pray in this way, he's saying there's going to be something that's going to happen in your life. You're going to begin to know my peace. You're going to begin to feel a sense of ease in your soul if all of this
[time=2074] is really done, truthfully and honestly in your heart. And I know from my experience with this text over the last 13 or 14 years that really that tends to happen. I mean, it's not a magic formula, but it tends to occur that way when I work my way back through that. But then there is this caution. There is this caution. Look at verse 8, "If I start
[time=2095] thinking back through the situation in a negative way, I lose the peace. I can actually drum
[time=2102] myself back up into a frantic, strife-filled frenzy that was where I was at the beginning
[time=2108] before I started in verse 4." And so he says in verse 8, "Finally brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever
[time=2119] is of good repute, if there is any excellence, and if anything worthy of praise, let your mind dwell on these things. Let your mind dwell on these things." So there is a certain
[time=2131] restriction on what we are able to think. Now watch how that ties in. Look again at verse 7, "This peace of God shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." I did a little study on the word "guard." It's used of soldiers who guard a city. And there were two kinds of soldiers that would guard the city or they would be given two different kinds of tasks. Some would be stationed in a way to guard the city against intruders to
[time=2157] keep people from getting into the city. Other kinds of soldiers were stationed to protect
[time=2163] and monitor who left the city, who went out of the city. And in fact, the guard being mentioned
[time=2172] here is the kind of guard that protects who leaves the city, which I think is very interesting because when people go crazy they lose their, when people become overwhelmed with stress
[time=2185] and they seem to lose their capacity to function. And so the promise seems to be that the word
[time=2192] of God and the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall hold your faculties.
[time=2198] Which ones? Your heart and your mind together in Christ Jesus and you won't lose your mind.
[time=2205] You won't find yourself in a psychiatric ward where you have to be restrained for your
[time=2211] own protection and where you can no longer function in society. The Lord is committed
[time=2218] to keeping us intact for His glory so that we can be useful to Him. And as we commit ourselves, even in the worst possible circumstances, to these kinds of principles, His guarantee
[time=2231] comes along and says the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, it's beyond your ability to understand how this works, but it's going to guard your heart and your mind. It's going to keep you together through the difficulty and you won't lose it. You won't snap. That's
[time=2246] a wonderful promise, isn't it? Again, now, verse 8 is the next imperative. It's at the
[time=2252] end of the verse, "Let your mind dwell on these things." Now this is interesting. This is so appropriate because I believe with all my heart that many of us in the Christian community talk ourselves into this little notion, that it's okay to think whatever I want to think because thoughts are only thoughts. And the real standard of obedience in my
[time=2273] life is what comes out of my mouth and what I do by way of action. But I'm kind of free to think however I want to think. Now, we know that's not true, but we talk ourselves into it and we begin to live by that standard. For example, we say to ourselves, "I really,
[time=2287] really should..." I'm very upset at so-and-so. They've done something that's hurt me, and
[time=2295] so I figure out all this gossip that I want to say about them to somebody else, and this
[time=2302] is paragraph 1, and here's paragraph 2, and here's illustration 1, and here's paragraph 3. See, I got it all worked out in my head. So long as I don't say it to anybody, I'm
[time=2311] okay. Not true. Not true. I'm really, really mad about something. And I'm thinking about
[time=2321] how mad I am, and I'm running over it in my mind how mad I am. But as long as I don't tell anybody how mad I am, and as long as I don't do anything with my anger, yeah, it's it'll be okay. I'm safe. It's okay for me to think whatever I want to think because thinks their own thinking is only thoughts, and thoughts don't matter. It's words and behavior that matter. Forget it. Not true. Absolutely false. Listen to the words of our
[time=2347] Lord and the Sermon on the Mount. You have heard that has been said, thou shalt not commit adultery. Don't go do the act of adultery. He, of course, is referring back to the law of Moses, one of the Ten Commandments. And he was with a bunch of religious externalists who thought that it was okay. They were holy and spiritual if they didn't go commit adultery.
[time=2365] But then he said to them, but I say to you, if you look at a woman and lust for her, you
[time=2371] have committed adultery with her already in your heart. He's saying the standard isn't just behavior. Behavior is important. But Christ moves past the externals and goes into
[time=2382] the inner recesses of the heart and the mind and says you must think appropriately. That too is a part of the standard of true spirituality. So Proverbs 23 7 says, "For as a man thinks
[time=2394] within himself, so is he. So is he." You want to know who you really are, what your real
[time=2400] identity is? Survey this, not just your lips and your behavior. You've heard this phrase,
[time=2409] so a thought, reap an action, sow an action, reap a habit, sow a habit, reap a character,
[time=2420] sow a character, reap a destiny. That's good. That's true. It starts up here and it works
[time=2427] its way out. So a thought, reap an action, sow an action, reap a habit, sow a habit, reap
[time=2433] a character, sow a character, reap a destiny. That's why the Word of God talks so much about our thinking processes. Luke 10 27, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind." Romans 12, "Be transformed
[time=2452] by the renewing of your mind." 2 Corinthians 10 5, "Take every thought captive to the obedience
[time=2458] of Christ." That's good. "Take every single thought captive to the obedience of Christ."
[time=2467] Peter 1, "Gird your minds for action." Colossians 3, "Set your mind on things above, not on
[time=2473] things that are on the earth." Ephesians 4, 23, "Be renewed in the spirit of your mind."
[time=2485] Now how does this work? You work your way through verses 4 through 6. You begin to experience
[time=2491] the peace of God in verse 7. What he is saying is there is a certain limited amount of stuff
[time=2497] that you are allowed to think about in relationship to that future contingency. You are not free to think anything you want about that future contingency. You are not free to let your mind run all over the map and drum up all the doubt and all the fear and all the anger and all the bitterness that might come in relationship to that future contingency. You are restricted to thinking a certain parameter and when you move outside of that you are out of bounds.
[time=2521] When you start thinking about that future contingency in any other way than what is true about it, honorable, right, pure, lovely of good repute, those things which are of excellence
[time=2530] and those things which are this is good. Worthy of praise, that limits it down, doesn't it?
[time=2536] Any thoughts about that future contingency which aren't worthy of praise, they don't fit in your brain, reject them, bring every thought captive to the obedience of Christ.
[time=2546] Now you see once again, this is not oppressive, this is not a negative command, this isn't
[time=2552] God being some cosmic kill joy trying to destroy your life. Do you realize what happens when
[time=2558] you control your thought life like that? Do you realize what happens when you don't?
[time=2563] You empower other people and you empower circumstances to impact the well-being of your soul. By
[time=2571] thinking wrongly about a situation or a person you can actually empower them, put them in a place of influence in your life they have absolutely no business holding. I came across some information about this written by Stephen Covey in one of his books about how we can by wrongly thinking about another individual empower them to kind of wipe out the rest of our life. Listen to this, it's great. One friend of mine who taught at a university became very distraught because of the weaknesses of a particular administrator with whom he had
[time=2601] a negative relationship. So you got a teacher and an administrator and the teacher is upset at the administrator. He allowed himself to think about the man constantly until eventually
[time=2611] it became an obsession. It so preoccupied him that it affected the quality of his relationship
[time=2617] with his family, his church and his working associates. He finally came to the conclusion
[time=2624] that he had to leave the university and accept the teaching appointment somewhere else, can
[time=2630] stand being around this guy. So better to leave that place. Would you really prefer to teach at this university if the man were not here? I asked him? Covey speaking? Yes, I would,
[time=2641] he responded. But as long as he is here, then my staying is too disruptive to everything in my life. I have to go. Why have you made this administrator the center of your life?
[time=2651] I asked him. He was shocked by the question. He denied it, but I pointed out to him that he was allowing one individual and his weaknesses to distort his entire map of life to undermine
[time=2663] his faith and the quality of his relationship with his loved ones. He finally admitted that
[time=2670] this individual had had such an impact on him, but he denied that he himself had made all those choices. He attributed the responsibility for the unhappy situation to the administrator.
[time=2682] He himself, he declared, was not responsible. As we talked little by little, he came to
[time=2689] realize that he was indeed responsible, but that because he did not handle this responsibility well, he was being irresponsible. He had empowered a negative person in his life to dominate
[time=2700] his life. You know what the word responsible means? Response, able. Response, able. We
[time=2710] are able of determining our response, and that in large part depends upon the way we view the situation, what we think about the situation, the undermining values we have as we enter the situation. If you aren't responsible, you're irresponsible. You are unable of making
[time=2725] a response. You are purely reactive, which doesn't sound like freedom to me. It doesn't
[time=2731] sound like a powerful, purposeful life to me. It sounds like bondage. The Lord came to set us free. So we can put the wrong individual or the wrong thing at the center of our life.
[time=2743] It becomes too important because we allow our thinking to center on it and to prioritize it and to empower it. Let me give you some other illustrations. Your spouse. If you are spouse-centered, your joy is based on the way your spouse treats you. If you are family-centered,
[time=2760] your joy is founded on family acceptance or fulfilling family expectations. If you are
[time=2767] money-centered, your joy goes up and down with your net worth. If you are work-centered,
[time=2775] your joy goes with your occupational role or your status at the work or the way they treat you at work. If you are possession-centered, your joy is based on your social status or
[time=2786] the tangible things that you own. If you are pleasure-centered, your joy is governed by
[time=2792] how much fun you are having at any one given moment. Whenever it stops being fun, you have no joy because fun is the center of your life. It's the fundamental thing you think about.
[time=2802] It's what you have empowered to direct all the other emotions and direction of your life.
[time=2808] If you are friend-centered, your joy is heavily impacted by the opinion of others. Here's
[time=2817] one. If you're church-centered, you find your identity and your joy in religious labels
[time=2824] and comparisons. Well, the question is this. What should be your center? Christ. Christ
[time=2835] is the only possible center. The only possible center. When Christ is the center of your
[time=2841] life, your joy and your identity and your purpose and your perspective through which you choose to view and think about all the people and circumstances of your life is based on and in this one immovable, unchanging, loving, compassionate, self-sacrificing Christ.
[time=2858] And when He is your center, when He is your fundamental value, then you view everything in light of Him and you can have joy.
[time=2869] The same Christ who is your sovereign, verse 4, the same Christ who allows you and empowers you to give up your rights because He's already given you His inheritance to enjoy forever and ever undefiled in heaven. The same Christ who you know can never be surprised by the circumstances of your life, be anxious for nothing. The same Christ to whom you can pray and open lines of communications and humbly come to Him and thank Him for His direction in your life and then let Him really know what's in your heart.
[time=2900] The same Christ who will empower you to live in strength and honor and integrity. This must be the center of your life. To have any other center is to allow your emotions and your
[time=2912] joy to fluctuate by whatever that center is and you empower it to a place that only Christ
[time=2919] should have.
[time=2921] Which is your center? Where do you gravitate to on that list? I'll tell you where I gravitate to. Pleasure. It's always been my weakness. I want to have fun. I love to have fun. I
[time=2935] have lived to have fun at points in my life. Which way? Is it family? Is it spouse? Is
[time=2943] it money? What is it? Face up on that thing, dethrone it and say no, no, no, not you anymore
[time=2953] or maybe not you three anymore. I want Christ at the center of my life and only Christ and
[time=2959] these things are nice but they're not the center and so when they come I can enjoy them and when they leave, they've left. I'm sorry for that. There's a sadness with it but it doesn't take me off my course because Christ is the center of my life.
[time=2974] The last one is found in verse 9. These things you have learned and received and heard and
[time=2983] seen in me practice these things and the God of peace shall be with you. The imperative
[time=2989] verb, practice these things. Well first what are the these things? Notice the beginning
[time=2997] of the verse, the things you have learned and received and heard and seen in me. Paul is the me. As you know, they had no New Testament. It wasn't written yet. It was in the process of being written so everything they knew about Christ, everything they knew about doctrine, everything they knew about character, righteousness and holiness that we now read in the New Testament, they had gotten from Paul and so what he's basically saying to them is obey the truth of God. The things is the truth of God that I've given you. Then he says to practice them,
[time=3024] the word practice is the word for habitual pattern of your life, the characteristic habitual pattern of your life. Aristotle said this, we are what we repeatedly do. We are what we repeatedly
[time=3036] do. Excellence then is not an act but a habit. That's what Paul is saying. There must be
[time=3042] a habitual constant practice of obedience to the word of God or you will never know true,
[time=3048] genuine joy and peace. Now this should be patently obvious to us. There is no possible way that
[time=3054] an individual could come to this text and begin to practice four through eight and then say, well now I should have all the peace of God I ever want but continue to live in want and sinfulness. Let me say it to you this way. If you cheat on your income taxes,
[time=3070] you're not going to know joy and peace because you are constantly under the pressure of when
[time=3076] is the phone going to ring? When is the IRS going to call? When am I going to be found out and when
[time=3083] they call am I going to have the necessary funds to pay all that I've cheated them from plus the penalty? So you can't say I'll rejoice in the Lord and His sovereignty and His forbearing, I'll show a forbearing spirit and be anxious for nothing and pray. When the underlying pattern of your life is disobedience you'll never know joy, you'll never know peace. You can't know joy
[time=3104] and peace when you fail to show integrity in your business and you and you shortcut people
[time=3110] and you don't keep your word and you dishonor the contract in subtle ways in ways they wish you wouldn't find out. There's no joy there, that's a habitual pattern of sin and you can't break the
[time=3122] natural spiritual laws of God and expect to know an inner peace. It just doesn't work that way.
[time=3128] It's ridiculous thinking, it's like saying I'm going to be the best football player on the team next year and not work out all summer long and show up and say here I am ready to, I'm in shape
[time=3139] coach, put me to work. You can't do that, that doesn't make sense, that's breaking natural laws,
[time=3145] you got to work out to get in shape and then you play good football. You can't just pretend all that didn't occur, you can't live a sinful life and expect to know the joy of God. You can't lie to your wife, you can't lie to your wife and expect to know the peace of God.
[time=3162] You can't fail to invest time and energy and the passion of your life and your kids and watch them
[time=3170] grow up and try to invest yourself in them. You can't fail to do that, know you should be doing it,
[time=3176] know your priorities are off, know that you're failing them on a regular basis, feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit and then expect to claim some passage about the peace of God.
[time=3184] The underlying fundamental reality of the Christian life is you and I must be in the process of
[time=3191] practicing obedience. That's the foundation of real peace and real joy, is a life of obedience.
[time=3200] Then when we come to the difficult situations we recommit ourselves to rejoice in the Lord and
[time=3206] let our forbearing spirit be known and praying in certain ways and focusing our thought life in certain directions. Proverbs 28 1 says it very well, it says this, "The wicked flee when no one is
[time=3219] pursuing them." They are so panicked and so fearful and so guilt-written because they're wicked
[time=3226] that they are skittish. They flee when nobody's even after them because they carry with them on a
[time=3232] regular basis, the guilt and the shame and the embarrassment of their own wickedness.
[time=3236] The verse goes on, "But the righteous is bold as a lion." You see, when the underlying reality of
[time=3246] your life is consistent obedience to God, it doesn't mean you're perfect. When you sin, you confess it, you make it right, you seek accountability. There's a general pattern of righteousness, you're bold as a lion. Examine me, examine my life, look as deeply as you like. I have nothing to hide,
[time=3262] I have nothing to fear and so therefore I don't flee. There's stability.
[time=3266] That's why I get so concerned about unsaved people going to unsaved counselors to try to deal
[time=3273] with their stress and their anxiety. What is that going to do? You can't know the peace of God unless you're right with God and unless you're walking in His steps and there is no peace outside
[time=3284] the peace of God. So it's an exercise in futility. It's an exciting passage, isn't it? It's hard to
[time=3293] find one more practical. Let's look at it just one more time as we close and I'll try to etch it into your memory even stronger. There's a future event in my life and I can't sleep and it's affecting
[time=3304] my digestive system and I'm upset and I don't know what to do and I don't know how to handle it and
[time=3310] it's got me down and I don't know I'm depressed or wherever I am. Rejoice in the Lord always.
[time=3315] Remember the Lord is sovereign and He will orchestrate those events for His glory and for your perfection. Verse 5, take a close look for any personalities or people involved in that
[time=3326] stressful event and see which ones you're in conflict with and from your heart purpose to
[time=3332] either stand for your rights or give them up in a way that would further the kingdom of God, not your own agenda. Verse 5, be anxious for nothing which means be reassured that no matter
[time=3344] how difficult a situation it is not outside the perusal of your God. Nothing. But in everything,
[time=3352] pray, open lines of communication, communicate your humble dependence upon Him, thank Him in advance for the outcome of that future contingency and then let Him know what's really on your heart, what you'd really like and treat Him as your Father and say, "Dad, this is where I feel and this is
[time=3366] where I heard and this is how I like you to work it out." Verse 7, then the peace of God comes which
[time=3374] surpasses all comprehension and guards your hearts and your minds and holds your faculties together but then back in verse 8, assume the responsibility to guard what you actually think
[time=3384] about in relationship to that circumstance, the very limited realm of things that which is true
[time=3391] and honorable and right, etc. And then be reminded that the undergirding foundational reality of
[time=3398] your life must be the habitual practice of righteousness. The purpose of the Bible
[time=3406] hour today was to present a grand celebration commemorating the worship of our Lord and Savior
[time=3412] Jesus Christ. I hope you enjoy the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir, the men, singers, and soloists Susan Stout. The message today was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
