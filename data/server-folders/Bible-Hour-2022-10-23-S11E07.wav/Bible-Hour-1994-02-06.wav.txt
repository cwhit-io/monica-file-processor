[time=0] If you have those kinds of thoughts, it's not uncommon.
[time=6] It's not uncommon for the believer from time to time, sometimes regularly, to say to themselves, "Why am I doing this?
[time=12] Why am I giving this money when I'd rather spend it over here, or invest it over here, or use it to take my family and go over there?"
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=39] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=41] Thank you for joining us.
[time=43] Have you ever asked yourself, "Why do I give money to the church?" Have you ever looked at your giving record and thought of how those dollars might have provided a wonderful vacation, or maybe a down payment on a new car, or been used to
[time=57] boost your retirement fund?
[time=60] Well today in our study of Philippians 4, Pastor Russell Moore highlights four very exciting incentives to continue faithfully giving to the work of the Lord.
[time=70] Our special music today will be provided by the Brass Ensemble and Brian Lowson.

[time=287] We're glad you joined us for the Bible Hour and right now I want to take just a moment to tell you about a free gift we'd like to send your way.
[time=299] It's The Booklet by Charles Swindall entitled "Peace in Spide of Panic." Now, if you've ever found yourself looking for peace in your life and always coming up empty-handed, then this little booklet will really shed some light on finding real peace and we're offering it to you absolutely free.
[time=314] All you need to do is write us here at The Bible Hour.
[time=316] Our address, The Bible Hour, 7,400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=322] Now, let's return to our service.
[time=326] [MUSIC - 178 seconds]
[time=528] [APPLAUSE]
[time=538] We want to welcome you to The Bible Hour today. Thank you for joining us and we trust that God is alive and active in your life.
[time=544] That your sensing is presence and is love as you move through the situations in your daily life.
[time=549] I know that's the thrill of my life to know that I am walking with God and that I'm not alone in all of life's many trials.
[time=557] Today we're excited that Pete and Carol Coby have had an opportunity to travel out to California to visit his brother Mark who was right near the epicenter of the earthquake.
[time=569] I think Mark was no more than a mile away from the epicenter and so Pete and Carol obviously have a concern for he and his family, the opportunity to help put things back together.
[time=579] And then as you know, Carol and Pete are also going to travel up to Northern California where Pete's father and mother live.
[time=586] And so we're trusting they'll have a tremendous time and today Reed LaFavor who is a member of our choir in our church will be directing our choir and we're so thankful for his ministry and his involvement.
[time=595] And we'll be eagerly anticipating the return of Pete and Carol. Pete is such a gifted, wonderful music leader and director and we're so thankful for his ministry here in our church.
[time=605] We're also excited about the message today and the opportunity to talk to you about reasons to keep giving and incentives to furthering the work of God through your financial support.
[time=617] And the passage we come to, Paul is doing that very thing to some of his dear friends who were at the Church of Philippi. They had given him money and he was writing them a thank you note.
[time=628] And in the thank you note, he continues to reaffirm to them why it is a good thing for Christians to give to the work of the Lord.
[time=636] And that's a hard thing to remember in our day because there are so many competing voices and competing interests that want to draw our finances and really our hearts into other avenues.
[time=645] And then we cheat ourselves, the privilege and the blessing of giving faithfully to the Lord's work.
[time=651] And so I trust that even today as you hear the message, you'll be encouraged and reaffirmed as you give financially to support the work of the Lord.
[time=660] We also just want you to know that we are praying for all of you. We know that you don't always write letters but there are times regularly in our week where we'll just ask God to bless all the viewers of our Bible hour to encourage you to strengthen you.
[time=673] And we trust that you are indeed sensing that strength, that you're feeling encouraged, that you're faithfully pursuing your walk with the Lord.
[time=680] But this time we'll go back now to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=694] I dreamed I went to heaven. You were there with me. You walked upon the streets of gold beside the crystal sea.
[time=722] Heard the angels singing. Someone called your name. He turned and saw this young man and he was smiling as he came.
[time=739] And he said, "Friend, you may not know me now." But then he said, "But wait." You used to teach my Sunday school when I was only eight.
[time=756] Every week you would say a prayer before the glass would start. And one day when you said that prayer, I asked Jesus in my heart.
[time=774] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am a life that was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=799] I am so glad you came that another man stood before you said, "Remember the time a missionary came to your church and his pictures made you cry."
[time=822] You didn't have much money, but you gave it anyway. Jesus took the gift you gave and that's why I'm here today.
[time=839] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am a life that was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=864] I am so glad you came. One by one they came far as the eye could see. Each life is somehow touched by your generosity.
[time=888] Little things you had said and done, sacrifices made. I noticed I'm here in heaven now, broke way.
[time=906] And I know up in heaven you're not supposed to cry.
[time=914] But I am almost sure there were tears in your eyes as Jesus took your hand and he stood before the Lord.
[time=930] He said, "Why child, look around you. Great is your reward." Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=948] I am a life that was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=964] I am so glad you came. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=980] I am a life that was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=996] I am so glad you came.
[time=1023] Amen. Thank you, Brian.
[time=1040] Interestingly, Brian's song is a perfect introduction to the subject we studied today in Philippians chapter 4.
[time=1047] Paul is saying thank you to the Philippians for giving.
[time=1052] And so it really sets our minds and our hearts to the matter of our text today.
[time=1058] Paul is writing really the whole book of Philippians as a thank you note. That was the occasion for which he wrote.
[time=1065] And he finally comes to the subject in chapter 4 verses 10 through 19.
[time=1070] And we'll examine that this morning and find further the incentives to giving.
[time=1077] To prepare your mind or thought processes just a little bit further.
[time=1081] Let me ask you a question. Have you ever looked at your giving statement maybe from the church?
[time=1086] Or reviewed your checkbook where maybe you record the checks that you give when you give to the church or other Christian ministries?
[time=1093] And at the end of the year, seeing a grand total there and ask yourself my lands.
[time=1100] There's a lot of money there. What were some of the other ways I could have spent that?
[time=1105] And maybe in a sense ask yourself why do I give to the church? Why do I continue doing this?
[time=1113] Have you ever seen a neighbor drive home in a new car or talk to a friend about some wonderful vacation they're going to take?
[time=1123] Knowing that you're not able to take that kind of vacation, knowing that you're not able to drive that kind of car or live in that kind of house or wear those kinds of clothes.
[time=1132] And think in your mind how can they do that and I can't.
[time=1136] And realize it's because they're not saved and they don't give to the church and so whatever that is, whatever amount of money that is, is spendable income for them.
[time=1149] And you look at your own giving and you say if I didn't give what I give, I could drive a different car.
[time=1155] I could live in a different house. I could take one of those kinds of vacations on a regular basis.
[time=1160] And begin to question in your own mind why you give as you do.
[time=1165] Or heard from another friend who's involved in an investment of some kind for their future, maybe it's a real estate thing, maybe it's a stock opportunity, who knows what it is, a little business.
[time=1176] And you recognize you can't participate because you don't have the discretionary funds for that.
[time=1182] And once again they do and of course they don't give to the church, they're not in the redeemed community and again you say to yourself, "Oh man, maybe I shouldn't give.
[time=1194] What is really the profit of giving? Why do I do that?" And been tempted to reconsider.
[time=1200] That is not an uncommon thought for a believer to have.
[time=1204] If you're saying to yourself, "Yes, I've had that feel as though you are in good company. Many believers do and it's not an infrequent thing because we live in a culture and we live in a society that continues to beckon us to spend more money on different things."
[time=1218] And Paul here really speaks to that issue. This passage is not an injunction to give.
[time=1224] This passage isn't a rebuke for not giving. This isn't saying you ought to give more. This passage is going to affirm why we give.
[time=1233] It's a passage that encourages us and it lists incentives and motivation to just keep on giving.
[time=1239] What you've done is a good thing. And there are four of them. We'll see them here in this text.
[time=1244] He wants to reinforce our commitment to give by giving us these basic four incentives to giving to the cause of Christ.
[time=1252] First, let's set the context. Look at verse 10 for a minute.
[time=1255] "But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity."
[time=1265] You remember Paul is in prison in Rome. And the Philippians know that and he is under somewhat of a house arrest.
[time=1271] He's in his own apartment and he's chained to a member of the Praetorian Guard. He's waiting trial. He may soon die for his vibrant faith in Christ.
[time=1280] The Philippians want to help him. So they raise some money and send it along with a man named the Pafforditis.
[time=1286] And they say to a Pafforditis, when you get there, stay there and minister to Paul.
[time=1290] If he needs errands to be run, if he needs some help around the house, if he needs fellowship or encouragement, stay there.
[time=1295] Which represented even greater financial burden for this church in Philippi to cover a Pafforditis financial needs both as he stayed in Rome and those income that he couldn't make because he wasn't in Philippi where he had his job.
[time=1308] You see there the phrase you have at last revived your concern. The word revived is a horticultural term and it means to blossom or to bloom, to flower once again.
[time=1321] There's been a period of time since they've given to Paul. In fact, we can reconstruct from other passage. It's been about 10 years since the church at Philippi contributed to the work of Paul.
[time=1331] It was 10 years ago when Paul was in Philippi and when he worked around the rest of Macedonia, that's a region, Philippi is there, Thessalonica is there.
[time=1340] He eventually left Macedonia and went on to Athens and Corinth. This was on his second missionary journey.
[time=1346] And the people of Philippi would support him in those various efforts to those other churches. But that was 10 years ago.
[time=1354] And he's saying it's been 10 years but now your love, though you had concern before. You see that in verse 10. It's not as if I left your heart. It's not as if you didn't care about me.
[time=1364] You were concerned before. You've been concerned the whole time. It's just now you've had opportunity to blossom. Your love has bloomed again in my life.
[time=1374] You wanted to before but you lacked opportunity. We don't know what caused them to lack opportunity.
[time=1379] We do know that Philippi was a very poor church. In fact, Macedonia in general was not very wealthy.
[time=1386] And it may have been that they knew of his needs but couldn't come up with the resources to help him through that 10-year period of time.
[time=1394] It may have been on the other hand that they just couldn't keep up with him, you know.
[time=1398] Communication wasn't as effective in those days and Paul was always on the go and they may never have been sure where he was or how to reach him with funds.
[time=1406] So they wanted to and they had money but they just couldn't get it to him. And in that sense they may have lacked opportunity.
[time=1412] Or it may have been that they were just dedicating their funds to some other endeavor, maybe even their own church, maybe some surrounding churches.
[time=1419] And they really didn't have sufficient funds. They had to prioritize what they had and Paul wasn't on their priority list at that time.
[time=1425] And now finally as things have cycled, he's back on their priority list and they can support him in his ministry.
[time=1430] We don't know for sure. The point is he's saying, "I am so thankful and I rejoice greatly that now at last you revived your concern for me."
[time=1439] That's not a rebuke. He notes their concern had been ongoing. They had just lacked opportunity.
[time=1445] But then if you were here last week, you know that verses 11, 12 and 13 are all about contentment.
[time=1450] And he's explained to them that what was good about your gift wasn't what happened to me personally because I'm content in any circumstance that I'm in.
[time=1458] Whether it's poverty or whether it's prosperity. Whether it's being filled or going hungry, having abundance or suffering need.
[time=1465] The exciting thing about your gift isn't that I've received something.
[time=1468] And therefore my circumstances have been alleviated because verse 13 he says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
[time=1475] Well think about it now from the Philippians' point of view. They've scraped and scrimped to finally get enough money to get it off the Paul.
[time=1484] He writes back and says, "Thanks, I'm happy you gave, but keep in mind I didn't need it." Because I know how to get along in poverty. And I know how to get along when I'm hungry because I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
[time=1498] And so they may get the impression, "Well, why did we do it? I mean, what's the point? Why did we save? Why did we give? He didn't need it."
[time=1508] And so then he says in verse 14, "Nevertheless," do you see it? Nevertheless you have done well to share with me in my affliction.
[time=1516] And so now in verses 15 and 19 he's going to give the four reasons why it was good that they shared with him even though he had reached a level of contentment in any circumstance that he was in.
[time=1526] So he wants to take the issue far beyond his own personal needs that might have been met by their gift and draw them into significant, overarching, pervasive spiritual principles as to why we ought to give even independent of the financial need of the missionary himself.
[time=1543] So that's what he's saying here.
[time=1546] And because of that those principles are applicable to us and they help us understand and reaffirm to ourselves why we ought to be in the habit of giving.
[time=1555] Let's look at the first one, verses 15 and 16.
[time=1559] He says, "And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel," this is ten years ago when he first came there, "after I departed from Macedonia, your region, went on to Athens and Corinth, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone, for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs."
[time=1584] The glaring reality of these verses is caught in the little phrase at the end of verse 15, "But you alone," but you alone.
[time=1594] You were the only church supporting me as I ministered at Thessalonica and then went beyond Macedonia to Athens and Corinth.
[time=1602] As if to say, if you hadn't done it, it wouldn't have gotten done.
[time=1612] As if to highlight the sense of involvement that God wants us to have in the evangelistic enterprise, you were His unique instrument, you were the only thing we had going for us.
[time=1618] You, the church at Philippi, met the need and if you hadn't met it, it would have gone unmet.
[time=1625] He's saying to them, "You have participated in what God has been doing in reaching these people with the gospel."
[time=1633] It amazes me now, and this is kind of a curious thought.
[time=1636] You recognize, don't you, that God owns everything. He says in the Old Testament, all the gold and all the silver, which is a way of saying all the wealth in the world, is mine.
[time=1646] He says I not only own a thousand cattle, I own a cattle on a thousand hills, which is to say as many hills that you can dream of, wherever there is livestock, I own it.
[time=1657] I created it, I own it all. Here's the point. God has never been in financial need for one second of His existence.
[time=1665] There has never been a moment when He hasn't had enough money. He owns everything.
[time=1671] It just so happens, though, that this phenomenally wealthy God who owns everything has chosen to so structure reality in the here and now, the world you and I live in, the world that they were living in,
[time=1686] that in order for the work of the gospel to go forward, it requires the involvement and the financial participation of believers.
[time=1694] Now that's amazing. He didn't have to make it that way. He chose to make it that way.
[time=1700] He chose to structure the world in such a way that if the gospel was going to be paid for, and it's advanced to go from one city to the next, it would have to come from the resources of human beings, even though he doesn't need their resources.
[time=1713] Now that's not the only way he's done this. It's not just finances. You remember Romans chapter 10 talking about evangelism?
[time=1720] He says, speaking of the unbeliever, how shall he call on him in whom he does not believe?
[time=1728] You see, an unbeliever can't call on a God in whom he does not believe in, to be saved is the implication.
[time=1735] And then it says this, and how can he believe in him or on him of whom he has never heard?
[time=1743] How can you believe in a God you've never heard of? Well, you can't.
[time=1747] Well, if you have never heard of him, then you can't believe in him. And if you can't believe in him, you can't call on him so you can't get saved, can you?
[time=1753] And in the last phrase of that verse says this, and how shall they hear without a preacher?
[time=1760] Well, he doesn't mean me. He means us, the redeemed community that articulates the gospel of Jesus Christ as we fulfill our ambassadorship.
[time=1770] So get the picture. God loves humanity. God loves individuals who are dying in their sin and destined to hell.
[time=1777] He knows the only way to save them is for his only beloved son to die on the cross and suffer the burden of all their sin, which the son happily does for the glory of the Father.
[time=1788] So the plan of salvation is almost resolved. There's just this one last element that must occur if anyone is to get saved.
[time=1796] And it is totally dependent on human beings to do it.
[time=1801] They can't call on a God they don't believe in, and they can't believe in a God they haven't heard of, and they can't hear of this God unless you tell them.
[time=1810] He has put you at the center of his redemptive program in the church age.
[time=1816] That amazes me. We don't deserve such a role. We don't deserve to have a part of any of it. It wasn't our son.
[time=1822] We didn't pay for these sins ourselves. We were indeed saved by the grace of God.
[time=1827] We didn't even earn our own salvation. What business do we have being able to be central and integral and essential in the redemption of a whole humanity?
[time=1837] Nothing but the goodness of God. He longs for you and for me to feel a genuine, legitimate sense of participation in what he is doing on the planet.
[time=1849] My youngest daughter Whitney is four years old and she just, I'm happy to say, idolizes me.
[time=1857] Wherever I go, whatever I do, she wants to do it. If she hears I'm going to the store, she doesn't even ask.
[time=1866] I turn around, she's got her jacket on, and she's standing by the door.
[time=1870] If she knows I'm going to go outside and play with our 85-pound Labrador, she's ready to go.
[time=1877] She ventures into this very dangerous arena because my dog has knocked her over many a time, but that's okay if I can be with that.
[time=1885] Doing what that is doing, it's worth the risk. This week I'm shaving.
[time=1891] She comes in and looks up. She says, "Dad, I want to shave too."
[time=1898] So I pick her up, I push the stuff aside, I set her down, we get that shaving cream going, she's got it everywhere all over her.
[time=1908] She needs a razor, so I give her my toothbrush.
[time=1912] And we work on her shave, you see? You see that is so natural, isn't it?
[time=1919] It is so obviously patently natural that a child wants to be about the business of the father.
[time=1926] There is something inside of us that should be beckoning and calling us, "Oh God, please let me have a part in what is dearest to your heart.
[time=1934] Let me just be near you, let me just be with you, let me just be doing what you're doing." And so God creates and structures the world in such a way that though he is independent and autonomous and can save people by writing it into skies
[time=1949] or screaming it from the heavens through angels, which he will do in the book of Revelation.
[time=1953] But for they here and now, he is entirely dependent upon your witness to the unsaved community or they just will never hear.
[time=1961] And if they don't hear, they won't believe, and if they don't believe, they won't call, and if they don't call, they won't get saved.
[time=1968] One of the main incentives to giving my friend is God has opened the door for your involvement with him in the most important thing going in his life.
[time=1978] And with you and I free up our resources and give to God, we are privileged to say, "I helped God. I helped God."
[time=1990] I was a part of that process. And that's what he's saying. You and you alone.
[time=1997] You and you alone Philippians were the ones who stood with me and shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving.
[time=2004] You were God's critical instrument. You were the one that God would have used to save those other people in Thessalonica
[time=2010] and to save those other people in Athens and to save the people in Corinth because you were a part of the process.
[time=2017] Sometimes giving to God and being a part of the financial setup is dangerous.
[time=2023] What I mean to say by that is this. I received a phone call last night from a dear friend who is on his way to Russia today.
[time=2030] And he called out of concern in his heart for he knew it would be a dangerous journey.
[time=2036] And he was asking for prayer support, and we will, I trust, pray for him at the end of our service.
[time=2042] Because he is taking $87,000 in cash to the Soviet Union today.
[time=2051] In a backpack, we've tried all the other ways to send money to the Soviet Union, and none of them are effective,
[time=2057] and none of them are reliable, save the hand-carried deliverer with his cash.
[time=2062] But it puts the carrier in a very precarious decision or situation because when he arrives in Moscow,
[time=2068] he must meet in a back room with two or three customs agents, and he must declare his cash.
[time=2076] He must lay it on the table, and they must count it and see it with their own eyes.
[time=2081] It's a dollar to 35,000 ruble ratio. If you work it out, he has three billion rubles in his backpack.
[time=2093] And no one knows, except a couple of potentially dishonest customs agents
[time=2101] who themselves are living in a culture that is falling apart materially, and all they would need do is call a friend and say it's the guy with the backpack as he exits the airport, we need that bag.
[time=2111] And they get three billion dollars in their currency.
[time=2116] I don't know why God set it up this way.
[time=2119] I don't know why the involvement of cash into a situation where we can give.
[time=2123] I imagine many of the same prayers were lifted up for a path for that.
[time=2126] It says he left Philippi saying to his brother, and I have heard this satchel of gold and silver, and maybe some precious jewels that we've saved and we've given.
[time=2134] The question is will I ever make it to Rome, and when I make it to Rome, will I find it safely to Paul?
[time=2139] And once it's in Paul's possession, will it stay there?
[time=2142] For there will be the Praetorian Guard, who might also take a gander at the wealth that was there, as meager as it may have been.
[time=2150] All of this because God is concerned that you and I get to help.
[time=2155] All of this because God wants you and I to have a chance to contribute.
[time=2159] All of this because he doesn't want us sitting on the sidelines saying it's all up to God, God will handle everything. I'm saved, I'll just relax, and be left out of the process.
[time=2168] He wants our ownership, he wants our contribution, he wants us to receive the joy of all that participation.
[time=2174] The second reason, verse 17.
[time=2179] It says in verse 17, "Not that I seek the gift itself,
[time=2185] but I seek the profit which increases to your account." He's saying, verse 10, "I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, you've revived your concern, but I want you to know my joy, as we've already mentioned, isn't that I seek the gift itself?
[time=2198] I'm content." Read verses 11, 12, and 13, "I was okay.
[time=2201] What really fires me up, what really excites me about your gift is the profit which increases to your account."
[time=2210] Now you've got to see this. In verse 14, the word share is used in my version.
[time=2215] Nevertheless, you have done well to share. That was a common, ordinary day in the business community for the word partnership.
[time=2222] You have done well to partnership with me in my affliction.
[time=2225] He is saying we have opened up a general partnership in this endeavor.
[time=2230] Notice at the end of verse 15, with me in the matter of giving.
[time=2236] The word matter means to open an account.
[time=2238] So now he's saying not only is it a general partnership, but there's a specific account inside the partnership that has your name on it.
[time=2244] You have opened a specific account also in verse 15, the matter of giving
[time=2250] which is to be used in those days as a payment or an installment in the investment program.
[time=2256] This initial gift, which you have sent to me through Apaphroditus, both this man and the money he brought, is the installment that goes into the account with your name on it
[time=2267] in the general partnership that we have established together, you and me, Philippians.
[time=2272] And then he says at the end of verse 15, "And receiving, giving and receiving that we're receiving is to credit and debit, meaning I have given you a receipt for your installment." It's business terminology from the beginning to the end.
[time=2284] It is all about establishing a spiritual partnership, but to get the cookies down on a bottom shelf where the rest of us can understand it, he uses business terms, common every ordinary partnership terms, so we'll think about it in those terms.
[time=2298] Having set the stage for that, then in verse 17 he says, "I don't seek the gift for me.
[time=2303] I seek for the profit which increases to your account."
[time=2309] Having given, having established a partnership, there's an account with your name, you've got a certain percentage in this venture, you've been receded for it.
[time=2319] Now, as this partnership does its work and as spiritual blessings are accrued, a certain percentage of those go back into your account.
[time=2327] You get the blessing, you get the profit spiritually.
[time=2333] About three and a half years ago, Bob Provost called me and said, "Russell, we need to buy an apartment in Moscow." He said, "It's just impossible.
[time=2341] There's a certain situation that requires our buying an apartment and it's going to be $3,500.
[time=2346] It's all furnished.
[time=2347] It's two bedrooms.
[time=2348] It's in a great location.
[time=2349] We just need to purchase this because there's a translator that we need to put in this apartment so that he can be available to us when we travel to and fro." Well, the church I was with at that time didn't have $3,500 and couldn't take a special offering and get $3,500.
[time=2366] So I called one of my good friends, a Christian brother of mine, who is in banking and does relatively well.
[time=2371] And I said, "Ron, you're not going to believe the opportunity we've got." We can buy an apartment in Moscow, fully furnished, two bedrooms, $3,500.
[time=2383] I'm in for the first five.
[time=2385] You want to match me?" He says, "Well, sure." So I call my dad.
[time=2390] He says, "Sure." So I call my other buddy.
[time=2392] He says, "Sure." I call my brother-in-law, "Sure." Before you know it, we've got our partnership put together and we buy a $3,500 apartment in Moscow.
[time=2401] Not in our name.
[time=2402] We give it to Bob.
[time=2403] Bob gives us the church in Russia.
[time=2404] The church in Russia buys it.
[time=2405] The church owns it over there.
[time=2407] But you see, in the eyes of God, I am involved in a partnership
[time=2414] with my other buddies, Bob and the church at Russia.
[time=2418] And this translator named Sergei, who when I was there several years ago, translated for me, speaking to 2,000 young people in the Carpathian mountains of Russia.
[time=2426] And every word I'd say, "He translates." I was teaching these young people how to evangelize.
[time=2432] Do you know what that means?
[time=2434] That means when all those people go evangelize?
[time=2436] Whoever comes to Christ, our account goes up.
[time=2440] But greater things have happened with Sergei since then.
[time=2443] Far greater, a team of seminary professors and pastors from the states came, and they gathered 3,500 pastors from all over the former Soviet Union.
[time=2452] And they were there, including guys like MacArthur, and this Sergei was translating and translating and translating for seven days straight, all about the philosophy of the church and how to preach the Word, how to win people to Christ, and all the rest.
[time=2465] Do you know what is happening to my spiritual account when that occurs?
[time=2470] Those 3,500 guys go back into their churches and teach their people and it explodes all over Russia.
[time=2476] And it's like, "Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching."
[time=2483] And as Brian sang, "For the glory of God, I truly expect to see people I have never met before.
[time=2492] Come up to me in heaven, and in a language I can understand." Say, "Thank you." Thank you.
[time=2500] Now, of course, we're going to take all of our rewards, and we're going to take all of anything that we might have done, because it's all by the grace of God, and we're going to throw it back at the feet of Jesus.
[time=2508] But Paul is trying to say something to you.
[time=2510] Paul is trying to communicate with you.
[time=2512] You have the option of taking your hard-earned cash and saying, "No to this, and no to that, and no to this, all of those which will eventually burn and are temporal, and though they are for our enjoyment." You may choose to opt out of those and begin to establish some partnerships which will accrue to your spiritual account.
[time=2534] I believe he wants you thinking about that.
[time=2536] I believe he wants you counting on that.
[time=2538] I believe he wants you recognizing that because you give to this church and other places, and when you hear back as to what is happening in those places, he wants to reaffirm in your mind, "Yeah, and I'm a part of that.
[time=2549] And I'm getting part of the spiritual profit of that." In other words, my life is more than my life.
[time=2556] My life is more than my life.
[time=2558] My life is where my money goes as it advances the cause of Christ.
[time=2562] Pretty big incentive.
[time=2564] It also causes you to want to be careful where you put your money, to invest in places that are truly going to be biblical and sound and evangelical.
[time=2572] It calls for discernment and giving.
[time=2574] Just for example, look back at verse 16.
[time=2579] See what he says there?
[time=2580] "For even in Thessalonica, you sent a gift more than once for my needs." He's saying, "You opened an account with me, and part of it was directed at Thessalonica." Well, in Thessalonica when Paul got there, a church was born.
[time=2591] People came to Christ and a church began, and it just so happens that this particular church was one of the most evangelistic churches in the New Testament.
[time=2599] Paul, later in a book to the Thessalonians, says about them, "For the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you, not only in Macedonia, the region of Philippi and Thessalonica, and Achaia, the neighboring region, but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we have no need to say anything." So the Philippians are recognizing that they happen to have been involved in a spiritual partnership that included the Thessalonians, and that was a goldmine spiritually.
[time=2628] The thing just exploded.
[time=2630] The third reason, verse 18.
[time=2635] He says there, "But I have received everything in full, and have an abundance.
[time=2642] I am amply supplied, having received from a paphroditis what you have sent a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
[time=2653] When you give, you have the opportunity of bringing a smile
[time=2661] to the face of God.
[time=2663] He is, of course, using Old Testament language, a fragrant aroma, and an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God.
[time=2669] It goes all the way back to Genesis chapter 8, and Noah gets off the boat, and he's so thankful to be alive, and he's so thankful that God spared he and his family in that great flood that he builds an altar, and on that altar he offers some animals, and he burns those animals, and God is seeking to help him understand the value of that sacrifice.
[time=2687] What does that sacrifice really all about?
[time=2689] And so he says, "The smoke of that sacrifice ascends up into heaven, reaches my nostrils, and it is, to me, a sweet-smelling aroma." Just like those wonderful aromas we smell on Saturday and Sunday afternoons in the summer when your neighbor is barbecuing ribs, and it wafts over the fence and into your neighbor's, I mean, into your own backyard, and you go, "Oh, man.
[time=2713] I haven't seen my neighbor in a long time." You know, that's what, see, God doesn't have a nose.
[time=2722] God is a spirit, but he condescends to communicate to us in terminology that makes sense.
[time=2730] He says, "It is as if the burning of that animal finds its way to my nostrils." And what happens when something good comes to your nostrils?
[time=2738] It's enlightening, and it's enthralling, and it's wonderful, and it's satisfying.
[time=2742] When you give my friend, you bring a smile to my face, you thrill my heart, you touch me in a meaningful way.
[time=2749] That's what he's saying.
[time=2751] And though you and I don't offer animals anymore and burn them, and so even the imagery of the smoke is gone, he's saying, "It's not a check you put in that offering plate.
[time=2760] It's not just a $20 bill, my friend.
[time=2762] It is something that reaches all the way to my nostrils, to my attention.
[time=2767] It touches my heart, and I'm thankful for what you've done.
[time=2770] You are worshiping me when you give.
[time=2772] That's why it's in the worship service.
[time=2774] There are other ways to give.
[time=2776] But not so trying to be biblical.
[time=2779] We not only sing the praises of God, we not only have the praises of God sung to us, we not only study the Word of God and praise God in response to the declaration of His truth, but a vital part of our worship experience is passing that plate so you can, from your own heart, offer up something to please God." Boy, that's an incentive.
[time=2801] He's done so much for us.
[time=2803] Isn't it wonderful to think as we faithfully give?
[time=2805] And of course, you know he doesn't care how much.
[time=2807] Whatever is in your heart to give, if it's from a pure heart, if it's sacrificial, if it's for the desire to bring him honor in true worship, it does.
[time=2816] It does.
[time=2817] You reach the throne room of heaven every time you give with a pure heart.
[time=2823] Well, there's one last wonderful motive that he wants us to see.
[time=2833] And it's this last one, the fourth one.
[time=2836] Verse 19, he says, "And my God shall supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus." Now I want to say right up front, this is a tricky thing to understand, and I'm not sure I fully understand it myself.
[time=2850] What do I mean here?
[time=2852] We're talking about a group of people who do not have an abundance of this world's goods, the Philippians, giving out of their poverty.
[time=2859] Second, Corinthians chapter 8, I think verse 2 says, "When they amass their little bundle of gold and silver and they hand it to Epaphroditus, many of them who gave that money are not really certain in their own mind how they're going to cover their own financial needs tomorrow."
[time=2879] That's a part of sacrificial giving.
[time=2881] Many of them have come to the edge of faith and the edge of trust and saying, "Yeah, I know I can meet next week, but what happens if my business doesn't do so good?
[time=2891] Or what happens if this happens?
[time=2894] Should I have taken that money and tucked it away in a safe place?" Mindful of 1 Timothy 5, 8, if you as a believer fail to provide for your own household, you're worse than an infidel you've denied to faith.
[time=2906] We understand as believers, there's a responsibility to work and work hard and provide for our families and care for the future.
[time=2912] But giving and giving sacrificially takes us to the edge of irresponsibility.
[time=2918] It takes us to the edge of faith and trust.
[time=2921] And that was the case with many of these Philippian believers knowing that as that money disappeared out of their sight, they may within a month or two months say, "Oh my goodness, I can't make it." So there is this verse.
[time=2935] "My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory in Christ." Now what makes this so tricky, this is not some kind of formula that says if you're in financial trouble, you give and God will take care of the rest.
[time=2948] This is not some type of formula that says you give sacrificially, and I'll guarantee that your standard of living always stays the same or goes up.
[time=2956] That's not what he's saying.
[time=2957] Remember what a need is according to the Scriptures?
[time=2960] First Timothy 6, "With food and clothing, we shall be content.
[time=2964] Our needs stop when we have eaten and we are clothed." And it's very difficult for our culture to understand that concept because we are so far above eating and being clothed and we define needs as my standard of living.
[time=2978] So it gets confusing.
[time=2980] Let me share with you though what I think is the heart here that he is offering as an incentive.
[time=2987] He is saying that God will not be in your debt.
[time=2991] God will not be in your debt.
[time=2993] God will care for your needs out of the riches of his glory.
[time=2998] Two things came to my mind as I studied this week.
[time=3000] So both of them examples out of my own life which may give a sense of this I think.
[time=3006] Obviously as many of us when we are just married, there isn't a lot of resources.
[time=3011] And I was in seminary there beginning a four year stint in that working at Grace Community Church, making $500 a month.
[time=3019] Heidi was finishing her time there at UCLA so she wasn't working.
[time=3024] And then by the grace of God we ended up pregnant five weeks into our marriage.
[time=3031] And so within a years time we've got a dependent and we're in the most reasonable apartment we can find and proximity to our church where we're working.
[time=3041] But money is running out folks.
[time=3045] We came into the marriage, Heidi had saved $4,000 through her high school and college work.
[time=3050] She had that as her little nest egg and then she had a car and I had a car and I had some stock that had been given to be my grandparents when I was 16 years of age.
[time=3059] And every single week those resources were just depleting and depleting and depleting until finally all of them were gone.
[time=3066] Sold the car, we had one car and nothing left over this period of time.
[time=3072] Education is expensive and you got to get started and that's not an uncommon experience.
[time=3077] We just felt that in the midst of that we couldn't not give.
[time=3081] Even though the resources were heading downhill we just knew that somehow we had to be contributing, somehow we had to be giving.
[time=3088] There was no peace in our heart to do anything other.
[time=3090] And as meager as it was we were at least satisfied in our hearts that we could give something.
[time=3096] But you know God did some things in those four years.
[time=3100] God did some things in those four years that always reminded us He was watching us. We never went without food and we never went without clothing.
[time=3110] And there were even times when He would give us special blessings.
[time=3114] It was the Sunday before our first anniversary.
[time=3118] Heidi was in the nursery there at Grace Community Church.
[time=3121] You know, 10,000 people mulling around on any given Sunday.
[time=3125] She puts her diaper bag down to work with Randy Gitter from the helper there in the nursery.
[time=3130] She picks the diaper bag up, puts it on her shoulder and heads off.
[time=3133] We go home and open the diaper bag.
[time=3137] There's a $20 bill in the diaper bag.
[time=3142] Nobody knew we didn't have any money for our anniversary dinner.
[time=3145] Nobody knew we were heading downhill like this.
[time=3149] God knew.
[time=3152] What I'm trying to say is this, when you put yourself, when you give like that, when you give even though you don't know how you're going to give, when you give in such a way that you don't know for sure what tomorrow brings, you put yourself in a very unique position to be personally ministered to by God Himself.
[time=3167] I'm convinced to this day that God put that $20 in that diaper bag
[time=3173] through some human instrument.
[time=3177] Even now, as an established couple, and since we moved here to Fort Wayne, Indiana, there was an opportunity for us to give more than we had anticipated, more than we had planned, and to do so would have jeopardized that little part of your budget called the contingency part.
[time=3191] But the opportunity was too ripe and too wonderful, and so we prayed about it and we gave that money.
[time=3197] Unexpectedly and prematurely, our roof needed to be replaced.
[time=3201] That happens in Indiana.
[time=3207] Well, we got some help from a really neat guy in this church.
[time=3210] He got us the lowest possible prices on the actual material, got us the lowest possible prices on the people that were going to do the work.
[time=3216] They did a phenomenal job. Everything was wonderful.
[time=3219] The roof was bigger than they thought, and the bid came in.
[time=3223] The cost was $800 over.
[time=3226] We didn't have it. We didn't know what we were going to do.
[time=3229] We started thinking, well, we could sell this and we could sell that, or we could do this or we could do that, maybe we could get a loan from, well, what are we going to do? There were some options.
[time=3239] Within three weeks, and we don't tell anybody about our problem, nobody knows this, we get a check for $300.
[time=3249] The next day, we get another check from somebody who didn't know our problem and, by the way, had never given to us ever.
[time=3257] You guessed it. $500.
[time=3261] See? God. He lives.
[time=3265] He wants you to understand, my God shall supply all your needs.
[time=3269] Was it a need in the raw sense? No, we had plenty of food and plenty of clothing, and we even had options to pay for that $800 problem.
[time=3276] But I believe, again, with all my heart, God is saying, "I'm involved in your life. I care about you. I know your needs." And when you give sacrificially and you give at some point that pushes you to the edge, you put yourself in a position to receive from God personally, because he's the only guy that knows.
[time=3297] So in another sense, I believe one of the incentives of giving is you put yourself in a place to be ministered to specifically by God the Father.
[time=3306] And it's priceless.
[time=3310] What in your world could be more valuable? What in your world could be more exciting than sensing, "Oh, my goodness. God met the need." You can't put a price tag on it. Why give?
[time=3322] Number one, you can help God.
[time=3324] God has structured this world in such a way that you get to help him do what he needs to do.
[time=3329] Number two, you get to participate in spiritual profit sharing.
[time=3333] Number three, you get to bring a smile to the face of God and enter the throne room with something that pleases him.
[time=3341] And number four, you get to experience his personal provision.
[time=3346] You're a giving church just like the Philippians.
[time=3350] This is not a message that is trying to beat you over the head and say, "Give more." This is a message that says, "As with Paul, thank you for giving." And here are the reasons why.
[time=3358] Here are the reasons why you've done well to share of your financial resources.
[time=3363] Thank you. Let's pray to God.
[time=3366] Father, thank you for the word. Thank you for its ability to strike at our hearts
[time=3373] and not just always convict us of our sin, though that is a vital role and not just always teach us about you, though that is a vital role, but at times even to encourage us and thank us and help us reaffirm our values as to what is important, especially with the use of our money.
