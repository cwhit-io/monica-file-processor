[time=0] Paul is saying goodbye. He is signing off. He is completing his letter, his epistle of joy.
[time=7] And while it is not necessarily a long goodbye, it's only four verses, verses 20 to 23, it is nevertheless
[time=16] a very meaningful goodbye. And there are some themes here that he establishes that flow out of his own heart and which I know he wants to embed in their minds that will benefit
[time=26] us even as we say goodbye to this letter and can carry with us a few lingering remaining thoughts.
[time=36] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=50] you will find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Saying goodbye to dear
[time=56] Christian friends is never easy, especially when the possibility exists that it will be your last. In our study this morning, the Apostle Paul says goodbye to his beloved Philippians.
[time=67] And as he does, we gain new insight into his heart and mind. We find him giving glory
[time=73] to God, promoting fellowship within the body and committing them to the protection and care of the wonderful grace of Christ. Our special music today will be provided by Becky
[time=85] Holman and David Staton. Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=115] [MUSIC - 209 seconds]
[time=335] We're glad you joined us for the Bible Hour and right now I want to take just a moment to tell you about a free gift we'd like to send your way. It's the booklet by Charles Swindall entitled "Peace in spite of panic." Now if you've ever found yourself looking for peace in your life and always coming up empty-handed, then this little booklet will really shed some light on finding real peace and we're offering it to you absolutely free. All you need to do is write us here at the Bible Hour. I'll address the Bible Hour 7400 East State Street Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815. Now let's return to our service.
[time=367] [MUSIC]
[time=380] Things change, plans fail. You look for love on a grander scale.
[time=393] Times fly, hearts turn, and you lose your hope in something.
[time=405] When the gold gets tough, when the ride's too rough, when you're just not sure enough,
[time=417] Jesus will still be there. His love will never change, sure as the steady rain.
[time=430] Jesus will still be there. When no one else is true, he'll still be loving you.
[time=444] When it looks like you've lost it all, and you haven't got a prayer,
[time=452] Jesus will still be there.
[time=460] [MUSIC]
[time=470] Times fly, hearts turn, a little bit wiser for lessons learned.
[time=483] Sometimes weakness wins, and you lose your foothold once again.
[time=495] When the gold gets rough, when the ride's too rough, when you're just not sure enough,
[time=507] Jesus will still be there. His love will never change, sure as the steady rain.
[time=520] Jesus will still be there. When no one else is true, he'll still be loving you.
[time=534] When it looks like you've lost it all, and you haven't got a prayer, Jesus will still be there.
[time=551] Jesus will still be there. His love will never change, sure as the steady rain.
[time=564] Jesus will still be there. When no one else is true, he'll still be loving you.
[time=578] When it looks like you've lost it all, and you haven't got a prayer, Jesus will still be there.
[time=621] Hello, and welcome to the Bible Hour. We're thankful that you're with us today.
[time=630] Again, we are missing our beloved Peter Kobe. He and Carol are out in California,
[time=636] finishing up a little trip there, went out to check on his brother, who was very close to the epicenter of the earthquake
[time=643] that recently struck in Southern California, and then up the coast a little bit, Pete and Carol's mother live, and so we're trusting they've had a great, great visit.
[time=652] They're refreshed, and we look forward to their return next Sunday as they continue to assist us in the worship service of our church.
[time=660] Well, we are excited to draw to a conclusion our study of the book of Philippians today.
[time=665] We trust it's been a fruitful time for you, and that even though the book comes to an end in our preaching, it will continue to live on in your heart.
[time=672] Well, we'll go back now to the regularly scheduled portion of our service.
[time=692] [MUSIC - 273 seconds]
[time=979] Amen. Thank you, Dave.
[time=982] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bible and come with me to the Book of Philippians for what will be our last message, our last time in this wonderful, wonderful epistle that Paul wrote to his beloved brother and in Philippi.
[time=998] And I must confess happily that my time in studying and preaching this book has been the best that I've ever had.
[time=1005] It's been the best time, the most refreshing, the most fun, the most joyful as I've studied this book and had a chance to preach it to you.
[time=1012] And I kind of come to the end of the book with a sense of sadness.
[time=1015] I wish it were like the Book of Romans and would run on for 16 chapters, so we wouldn't have to be done already.
[time=1021] But I also would ask your prayers and for your suggestions as we anticipate what we might do next, I think we'll break from the book study for a bit, having finished this book and run with a few topical messages, although I'm not really sure as to which topics to cover.
[time=1037] And so if there's something on your mind, something you'd like to know about, something you think would be beneficial for us, I would encourage you to jot me a note or call a receptionist and leave an idea or two or drop me a piece of paper just as you see me with some ideas, and then also we'll move after the topical message, just back into a study of a book of the Bible, and maybe you have a preference there or a need that you sense in our family.
[time=1060] I'd love to hear from you.
[time=1061] I can't promise I'll accommodate all the suggestions, but I certainly would like to be informed by them.
[time=1065] But for sure, please pray that God would direct my heart and as we anticipate to bring things, messages that are meaningful to our family.
[time=1073] This morning, as we come to this last message in the Book of Philippians, Paul is saying goodbye.
[time=1079] He is signing off.
[time=1081] He is completing his letter, his epistle of joy.
[time=1085] And while it is not necessarily a long goodbye, it's only four verses, verses 20 to 23, it is nevertheless a very meaningful goodbye.
[time=1093] And there are some themes here that he establishes that flow out of his own heart and which I know he wants to embed in their minds that will benefit us, even as we say goodbye to this letter and can carry with us a few lingering, remaining thoughts.
[time=1108] Three themes, if you will, that mark his goodbye.
[time=1112] The first is found in verse 20.
[time=1115] He says, "Now to our God and Father, be the glory forever and ever, amen." The word glory is the word "da-xah" in the Greek.
[time=1125] It's the word from which we get our word "da-xology." And what Paul is doing here is he is offering up a brief worship of God.
[time=1133] He is saying that there's too much pith up in my heart.
[time=1136] I am too exhilarated with the truth that has been portrayed in this book to just end it.
[time=1141] First, I have to give glory to God.
[time=1143] First, I have to worship the true and living God.
[time=1146] The word "da-xah" means adoration, praise, honor, respect.
[time=1151] And there's an interesting sequence if you'll notice in the New Testament.
[time=1155] This is not the only place where he pauses or stops in his writing to just burst forth with praise.
[time=1161] It happens consistently after there has been a marvelous revealing of truth that before had never been known.
[time=1170] For example, in the book of Romans, which the book of Romans, by the way, is the greatest doctrinal treatise in all of the New Testament, it is full and profound in its understanding of the depravity of man and justification by faith and the work of Christ and the implications of salvation and sanctification.
[time=1186] I mean, if you want to learn about doctrine principally and almost line upon line and precept upon precept, you go to the book of Romans.
[time=1196] Well, when he is finished with the doctrinal portion of that book, and as he transitions then to that great passage in chapter 12 where he talks about giving your life a sacrifice to God, the implication of all that doctrine then would be to live as a living sacrifice before he goes to that first point in chapter 12.
[time=1215] At the end of all the doctrine, one through eleven, he says this, "All the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments and unfathomable his ways, for he who has known the mind of the Lord, or who became his counselor, or who has given to him that he might be paid back to him again." Now here it is, "For from him and through him and to him are all things, to him be the Daxa, to him be the glory forever, amen." At the end of the greatest doctrinal dissertation in all of the New Testament, he can't move to the practical implications in our lives without first worshiping God in response to the doctrine itself.
[time=1265] The same thing is true in the book of Ephesians.
[time=1267] Ephesians 1, 2, and 3, the book has six chapters, but the first three are all doctrine.
[time=1272] It's all about the mystery of the church.
[time=1274] It's all about the wall of partition being brought down between Jew and Gentile.
[time=1278] It's all about the great love of God which has redeemed us, given us all the spiritual blessings in the heavenly places, adoption being sealed in the Holy Spirit, our inheritance, the wonder of redemption.
[time=1289] The first three chapters read like a theological journal of sorts.
[time=1294] Before he moves then to chapter four, which would outline all the practical implications in a person's life, he pauses at the end of chapter three and says this, "Now to him who is able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according to the power that works within us, to him be the glory, the doxah in the church, and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever, amen." The point I'm trying to make is this.
[time=1319] Worship, the fitting response to doctrine is worship.
[time=1323] Worship is what we do in response to the truth of God.
[time=1327] When we see him and understand him and perceive him in ways that we had never seen him before, the response is to fall in our hearts and worship the true and living God.
[time=1336] And while Philippians is full of the life of Paul and full of the experience of the Philippians, there is doctrine here that is taught really fundamentally here and here only.
[time=1345] For example, the konosis or the humility of Christ, his taking on the form of human flesh.
[time=1351] This great doctrinal passage which confounds theologians even to this day, how Christ can be 100% God and 100% man and exist in the form of human flesh and live and die on our behalf.
[time=1362] And so in response to this great treatise, this great understanding of applied doctrine in the world, in which they lived in the world, in which he lives, before he says goodbye, he has to give glory to God.
[time=1374] He has to lift up praise and worship to God.
[time=1377] That, by the way, is why a worship service such as this is all about doctrine.
[time=1382] It's all about truth.
[time=1383] If you listen carefully to Becky's song and to Dave's song, you heard nothing but doctrine and truth put to lyrics and words which might be more familiar to our ears.
[time=1393] This music is an attempt to draw the truth of the word of God into your life and through the vehicle of emotions, excuse me, vehicle of music to touch your emotions, to excite your heart about the truth of God.
[time=1407] The same would be true with the great anthems that are sung by our choir.
[time=1410] They are predominantly truth from scripture put to music.
[time=1414] So there is in the worship service the truth of God through music, there is then our chance to give as we talked about last Sunday and then there is the preaching of the word of God.
[time=1424] Sometimes people say, well, this is supposed to be a worship service.
[time=1427] There's too much preaching.
[time=1429] Well, if you look at the example of the New Testament, every time you find these great worship passages where God is being given glory, it is always in response to great truth.
[time=1439] That's why in John 4 it says, "You shall worship God in spirit and in truth." There is no sense in worshiping God unless you worship Him in truth.
[time=1450] Let me see if I can't make that a little clearer.
[time=1452] When we think of idolatry, we think of a couple of different examples.
[time=1455] One would be those folks, natives in a far away deserted area who are worshiping, creating gods out of the creatures and the creation and they're worshiping the stars and the moons and certain animals and things like that.
[time=1468] We think of idolatry in a different context of the pagan religions where they have created their own gods and they have enshrined them in statues and temples and there is all the worshiping of a false God and traditionally and predominantly that is idolatry.
[time=1483] But there is an idolatry that goes on even in relationship to the true God.
[time=1489] Idolatry can occur even when you are worshiping the true God.
[time=1495] It's not that you always have to create your own, whether it be birds and animals or whether it be statues in some type of temple somewhere.
[time=1503] You can commit idolatry by worshiping the true God but misunderstanding who He is.
[time=1510] Thinking thoughts about Him that are not true.
[time=1513] Thinking thoughts about Him that are not unworthy of Him.
[time=1516] That is idolatry and that is the kind of idolatry that happens inside the church.
[time=1521] We've got the right God but the wrong understanding of the right God and it leads to idolatry.
[time=1527] It is idolatry.
[time=1530] That's why Hosea 6-6 says this, "God delights in the knowledge of God rather than sacrifice." It isn't enough that you worship the right God, even with sacrifices and in the Old Testament that was His prescribed fashion.
[time=1543] He is saying, "I delight in the knowledge of God, worship Me in true knowledge of who I really am." So we are called and beckoned to study the Word of God and understand the Word of God and understand God Himself through His Word properly and rightly.
[time=1559] A.W. Tozer said it this way, "The history of mankind will probably show that no civilization has ever risen above its religion." And man's spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no religion has ever been greater than its idea of God.
[time=1576] For this reason, the gravest question before the church is always God Himself.
[time=1582] The most portentous fact about any man is not what he at any given time may say or do, but what he is, excuse me, but what he in his deep heart conceives God to be like.
[time=1595] The fundamental issue about any individual is not what he at any given time may say or do, but what he in his deep heart conceives God to be like.
[time=1604] That's true.
[time=1605] That is the point.
[time=1607] We must fundamentally and first understand God and worship Him for who He is.
[time=1613] Anything else is idolatry.
[time=1615] You say, "Well, I don't do that." We certainly do not do that here.
[time=1619] I mean, read our confession of faith.
[time=1621] It's clear that we understand that it's true.
[time=1623] We have a very good confession of faith.
[time=1626] But I spent time talking, hour after hour after hour with people, and I spent time listening to my own mind, and I understand that while I may know the truth about God in a doctrinal statement somewhere, when I am confronted with the difficulties of life, I am quick then to fail my little theology exams.
[time=1644] That's what Bob Provost always used to call them.
[time=1646] We would get into trouble at the college, and we wouldn't know how it would solve our problems, and some of us would be fretting and worrying and trying to think of what to do, and he would walk through the door, sit down and say, "Let's pray." And before we do, remember, these tests are nothing more than little theology exams.
[time=1661] All the tests of life are nothing more than little theology.
[time=1664] I don't mean in general, I mean theology proper.
[time=1666] God himself, who is your God?
[time=1668] Do you understand him?
[time=1669] Do you trust him?
[time=1670] Do you conceive him properly?
[time=1672] And if you do, then all of these tests are little opportunities to prove that your understanding of him is consistent with the word of God.
[time=1678] It's a wonderfully refreshing and relieving experience.
[time=1682] If I were to survey you this morning and I don't want to do this, but if you were to raise your hand, I wonder how many of you would be able to raise your hand in response to this phrase, "I really don't feel like praying." You have a sense of separation from God.
[time=1698] I feel a sense of being shut off from him.
[time=1702] I believe in God.
[time=1703] I know I'm saved, but to be honest with you, I'm not in the mood to pray.
[time=1710] That happens.
[time=1714] That happens because as we look at our life, we have certain misunderstandings about who we think God is and what we think God is supposed to do and how he is supposed to perform in our life.
[time=1726] And when you feel a sense of distancing from God, it is typically because you have misunderstood him and you are believing in your heart that he has broken some kind of promise that he has made to you.
[time=1738] And so you withdraw from him step after step after step after step and your communication with your God falls and in so doing you remove yourself from the very source of strength and encouragement that you need to continue to live a productive life.
[time=1750] A lot of that happens because of misconceptions about the true and living God.
[time=1755] We get angry at God.
[time=1758] We get mad at God.
[time=1760] And oftentimes we don't even know we're mad at God.
[time=1762] Let me give you a little hint.
[time=1763] If you're mad at somebody, anybody, typically there is a sense of anger that goes with that that is directed at God because he ultimately is in charge of all your circumstances.
[time=1773] And when you find that there is anger in the relationships of your life and you're miffed at somebody or you're miffed at some situation or you're miffed at some circumstance, nine times out of ten, you can count on the fact that you are miffed at God even though you may not be able to recognize that in your thinking.
[time=1788] And so I actually wish I could go further with this and explain it better.
[time=1793] I feel someone at loss to do that.
[time=1795] Let me say this to you.
[time=1797] Let me encourage you this way.
[time=1799] You're thinking about God is the most important thinking that you do.
[time=1804] And when you feel angry at him or angry at others as a tip that you may be angry at him, when you feel distanced from him and don't want to pray to him, you are finding there very good evidence that you need to revisit your understanding of who God is and what he has said and see if it is consistent with the Word of God.
[time=1822] You may need a friend or two to help you do this.
[time=1825] And come back to the proper understanding.
[time=1828] Paul himself is in prison.
[time=1830] Been there four years.
[time=1832] Paul himself, those aren't a good circumstances.
[time=1835] Paul himself has those who has led to Christ turning against him, seeking his position of prominence in the church now that he's out of commission.
[time=1843] Believers who are preaching trying to take his place.
[time=1846] Paul is waiting for a death sentence to be executed by Nero himself.
[time=1851] In other words, Paul shows us enough of his own life and the hardship and the tests and the trials that he can come through it all and not only say I rejoice in it because it furthers the gospel and the kingdom of God and the person of Christ, but I can come to the end of all these circumstances and say that I worship God.
[time=1869] There is nothing inconsistent about my circumstances and my hardships and the fact that my life may not have worked out the way I wanted to work out.
[time=1877] There is nothing inconsistent with that and my ability to freely wholesale worship God because I properly understand him.
[time=1886] That should be some food for thought.
[time=1889] So he says, "Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever, amen."
[time=1895] And this little phrase forever and ever is just like a cyclical thing.
[time=1898] He's just hoping that forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever and of course that will be the case.
[time=1903] Redeemed saints in heaven will forever give glory to God.
[time=1907] Worship God, worship God in response to a true and right understanding of who he is.
[time=1913] Secondly, in his goodbye, he says this in verse 21 and 22, "Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.
[time=1920] The brethren who are with me greet you, all the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household." What's he saying?
[time=1928] He's saying as he writes this letter and as he is finished with it and about to hand it back to Epaphroditus, who would then make the journey back to Philippi and deliver the letter to the elders of the church where they would then read it and teach it and preach it and copy it and distribute it for the people.
[time=1944] He's saying with this letter, tell him I said hello.
[time=1948] I mean, pass the word around.
[time=1950] "Greet everybody," then he says, also in verse 21, "the brethren who are with me greet you as well," which would have included Timothy and probably Luke and a great number of other Christians who no doubt would have known that Paul was under house arrest and therefore someone immobilized couldn't go anywhere but he could take visitors and so you can imagine the hordes of believers and elders and pastors and teachers from all around surrounding areas who would have flocked to gain from him vital information about God and about truth and about Scripture and about the church.
[time=1980] So there's needless to say a countless number of believers who have gathered with him there to learn from him and encourage him and sit at his feet.
[time=1987] And the word "greet" there is not just the word in the Greek for hello, it is a word of tenderness and warmth and fellowship and he is saying, "Wish them good will or well being.
[time=1999] Let them know my fond affection for them." And so he is commending them to each other and he is exhilarated in the sense of fellowship that believers can have one with another.
[time=2011] It's an interesting word there, "saint." He uses it two times, 21, "greet every saint, 22, all the saints."
[time=2021] If there's ever been a word that's been mutilated and misunderstood and given a redefinition that it's original and tending, it would be this word, "saint." When we think of saint, in our day we think of somebody who has been made into a statue or somebody whose figure has been put into crystal and put in the window.
[time=2039] The idea of being a super saint, a super saint,
[time=2045] the Roman Catholic Church, for example, has made their saints into super saints, people who have exhibited unsurpassable devotion to the cause of Christ.
[time=2055] There are the saints or there are the believers or there are the commoners and then there are the super saints.
[time=2063] They are then canonized by the Roman Catholic Church, which means that they are made an official standard for all other saints to look to and even to pray to, which is why they are made into statues and which is why they are put into the windows of the churches, made to and venerated because there is a belief that this saint, this person who has achieved unsurpassable devotion to God, will have special favor in God now that they're dead and in heaven and so that the people who remain on earth can pray to the saint and the saint will intercede on their behalf in the presence of God.
[time=2099] That is why candles are lit in the name of the saint because the person lighting the candle who prays the prayer when the candle is lit believes that as long as the candle is burning so their prayer is going to the saint in hopes that enough prayers will be offered and the favor will be found in the eye of the saint that the saint will then pray for them in the presence of God.
[time=2119] You see, and you say to yourself, I don't want to be called a saint because those are the connotations of sainthood in our day.
[time=2126] It may interest you to know that that teaching is found absolutely nowhere in the Word of God.
[time=2133] No where in the Word of God, absolutely nowhere in the Word of God.
[time=2137] Are we ever instructed to pray to any dead Christian, noble or ignoble in the hopes that they will somehow represent us in the presence of God?
[time=2145] We have bold access into the throne room ourselves through Christ.
[time=2151] We have immediate access to God.
[time=2153] And so the notion of praying to somebody else is just ridiculous.
[time=2156] So you say, well, what is saint then?
[time=2158] What was its original meaning? What is it supposed to communicate to us?
[time=2162] Well, it is Paul's favorite word in all the New Testament for a believer.
[time=2167] And he uses it in connection with the very most common believers.
[time=2173] In fact, the Philippians, he says, greet every saint.
[time=2177] And so he uses a very individualistic word in the greet every, not all the saints, but every saint, as if to point out they are all saints.
[time=2185] The person who's just come to Christ, the person who's struggling in their sin, the person who is growing phenomenally, the pastor of that church, the elder of those churches, Paul himself is called a saint.
[time=2195] It's just this common fellowship of redeemed people without stratification,
[time=2201] without elevation, without any special privilege.
[time=2205] It's a little wonder that our Lord himself prohibited the calling of people in special categories.
[time=2211] He says in Matthew 23, "But do not be called rabbi for one is your teacher,
[time=2219] and you are all brothers. All we are is brothers.
[time=2222] There's only one teacher, and the one is a capital O, meaning Christ himself.
[time=2227] Do not call anyone on earth your father, for one is your father, he who is in heaven.
[time=2232] And do not be called leaders, for one is your leader, that is Christ, but the greatest among you shall be your servant." He says, "Greatness in the kingdom is not an exonerated place being made into a statue,
[time=2246] so that people can pray to you, servanthood or rather leadership in the kingdom is servanthood.
[time=2251] It's giving your life away, even as Christ did." So he seems by emphasizing the notion of saint even twice here to want to say, enjoy and revel and rejoice in the wonder of being a saint,
[time=2266] commonly holding a light precious faith.
[time=2268] The word saint actually means to be set apart.
[time=2271] It means to be sanctified. It means to be holy.
[time=2274] It means to be set aside unto God.
[time=2277] And that happens to every single person.
[time=2279] When they come to Christ, they are set apart unto God.
[time=2283] And they, as we will see, are put in a process that leads them to growth and sanctification and holiness which culminates in the presence of Christ at the end of the age.
[time=2293] So he is instead in saying or exonerating some celebrated small group of believers.
[time=2301] He is grabbing all of the believers together, each and every one of them, and saying, "Don't you understand our identity is common together.
[time=2307] We are separated unto God. We are separated unto holiness.
[time=2310] We are in the path of being perfected to be like Christ."
[time=2316] Now, however, some of these saints are worthy of special mention, not position, not veneration, not prayers, but mention.
[time=2325] Watch verse 22.
[time=2327] All the saints greet you, especially, especially those of Caesar's household.
[time=2335] And boy, that is loaded.
[time=2337] You have no idea what courses through the veins and the heart of Paul when he says, especially, especially those of Caesar's household.
[time=2345] Paul had always wanted to go to Rome.
[time=2351] Paul's missionary strategy in planning churches was to focus in on the major cities.
[time=2355] And so he would go from city to city to city to city, and hopefully and usually cities, which were intersecting with major transportation networks in the ancient world.
[time=2363] Because he knew if he could get the gospel started in a church, where a whole bunch of people were going through a particular city, then they would come through and find exposure to the gospel.
[time=2371] And the gospel then would be carried like a virus to wherever those people who had traveled there went home to.
[time=2378] Well, Rome was the center of all that stuff.
[time=2381] Everybody had to come to Rome.
[time=2383] Everybody had to come and check in with Caesar.
[time=2385] Everybody, cities would always send their delegates to Rome.
[time=2388] And so his hope and his passion and his cry was somehow to get the gospel established in Rome,
[time=2395] because then he knew the world would know.
[time=2400] Well, not only in Rome, but as God would have it, even those of Caesar's household.
[time=2406] What is that?
[time=2408] Caesar's household.
[time=2410] Well, that could have been the Praetorian guard.
[time=2413] The very ones who were chained to Paul on six hour shifts every day of his two year imprisonment there in Rome.
[time=2420] And they were chained to him and he would gospelize them in his words and his life and his action by the people who would visit.
[time=2426] They would get the best possible view of Christianity through Paul.
[time=2429] Maybe they got saved and they started sharing Christ with so many others.
[time=2433] And so maybe the cooks came to Christ and judges and financial officers and musicians and custodians and builders and stable workers.
[time=2441] Everybody, they didn't call it then, but what we would call government workers.
[time=2445] Everybody who worked for the government, the gospel was just running through the government, which thrilled his heart because when all these people would come from all these different lands and areas and cities, they would come principally to talk to people in government.
[time=2458] So not only would there be churches there in Rome, but the very people they would talk to at different points would be from the government and would be Christians.
[time=2466] And of course there may have been a special irony in this because Caesar at this time was Nero.
[time=2470] Nero was the arch enemy of Christianity.
[time=2473] Nero fancied himself a God and so he viewed Christ and Christianity as a rival system,
[time=2479] hated them and is remembered as being one of its most violent and vicious antagonists and persecutors.
[time=2486] Maybe one of his kids got saved.
[time=2488] Maybe his relatives got saved.
[time=2490] There is a legend in church history, not from the word of God, but there is a legend in early church history that says his wife got saved.
[time=2498] That Nero was out of the city on a trip and his wife came to Christ somehow, someway, somebody led her to Christ and he comes home to find the spiritual condition of his wife utterly transformed as she is praising God and worshiping God and paying homage now, not to him as God, but to Christ as God.
[time=2516] And it may have been that fit of rage that caused him eventually to take off the head of Paul.
[time=2522] So the legend goes.
[time=2524] We don't know that for sure.
[time=2526] But we do know that Paul was in Rome and that what he was saying is, you guys, it's happened.
[time=2533] It's happened.
[time=2535] People inside the atheistic system of our day, the most powerful government on the face of the earth,
[time=2542] the very citadel of atheism, people have come to Christ, now Caesar's household has been.
[time=2549] And my guess is I bet Christ was well received inside of Caesar's household.
[time=2554] They knew what kind of a man Nero was, they saw the treachery, they saw the debauched, horrible wretched condition of humanity under his control, those in his immediate sphere of influence,
[time=2565] and if they were saying to themselves, "If this is God, we need help." And so they get to see it and hear it through the Apostle Paul and other believers as it would travel from one heart to the next through his household.
[time=2578] And that would have brought great joy to the saints at Philippi.
[time=2582] Yeah, I'll read Luke 15 sometime.
[time=2584] Luke 15 is all about the joy that goes on in heaven when somebody comes to Christ.
[time=2590] There are three parables that are told there are a lady who had money but lost one of her coins, and so she swept her entire house, wouldn't stop tireless until she found her coin, and when she did she rejoiced.
[time=2601] It tells the story of a man who had a bunch of sheep and lost one and left them to find it
[time=2607] and brought the sheep back and rejoiced when he got his sheep.
[time=2610] There's one back.
[time=2612] It tells about a man who lost his son, searched for his son, found his son, and rejoiced at his return.
[time=2619] All through Luke 15 it says that heaven rejoices at the salvation of the soul.
[time=2625] Acts 15-3, Paul is moving through Phoenicia and Samaria,
[time=2631] and as he goes the Bible tells us he is giving a report.
[time=2635] It says this describing in great detail the conversion of the Gentiles and we're bringing great joy to all of the brethren.
[time=2645] As he would move through these regions he would tell about how all these people came to Christ, and each church would just have great joy at the salvation of other people.
[time=2654] And so he is contributing to the joy.
[time=2656] It was a part of his practice.
[time=2657] It was a part of his life to tell the believers about other believers.
[time=2661] And here he gives them a kind of a report on their financial spiritual report and the spiritual partnership we talked about last week.
[time=2668] He's saying already we're reaping dividends.
[time=2673] Thirdly, and lastly, look at verse 23.
[time=2679] He says this, he hears last words, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."
[time=2689] They say, well now why is he saying that?
[time=2691] They already knew the grace of God.
[time=2693] They were already saved.
[time=2694] They were saints, remember?
[time=2695] And you only get to be a saint by the grace of God, unmerited favor.
[time=2698] So why is he now wishing on them the grace of Christ?
[time=2702] They already have it.
[time=2705] Let me say it to you this way.
[time=2707] We are unworthy of salvation at the point we are saved, and we are saved right then by the grace of God.
[time=2714] We are equally unworthy to stay saved and to be kept saved as we go on in our life.
[time=2721] And the only reason we are kept saved is because the grace of God continues to apply itself to our life.
[time=2728] When Italy come to Christ through grace, we stay in Christ through grace.
[time=2734] You see, grace is not a momentary thing that invades your life as if a prisoner is pardoned and then it's over.
[time=2739] The pardon is completed.
[time=2741] It's the grace of God that keeps the pardon criminal never to be convicted again.
[time=2746] And so it's the grace of God, Romans 5, 2.
[time=2750] It says, we stand in the grace of God.
[time=2755] It might interest you to know that every single epistle that Paul wrote ends with this same wish, that the grace of God or the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[time=2766] would be with those people.
[time=2769] Let me show you to you, just go back to Philippians 1 for a minute.
[time=2773] It's my favorite verse in the entire Word of God.
[time=2776] Someone has needle pointed it for me and put it in a frame that hangs on my wall.
[time=2781] It is my life verse.
[time=2783] It says in Philippians 1, 6, "For I am confident of this very thing that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ."
[time=2794] You see, here's the point.
[time=2796] When you get saved, you get lifted up out of the consequences and the guilt and the punishment and the shame of your sin.
[time=2802] And you get placed into the domain of grace.
[time=2806] Grace is described as a domain or a sphere or a power.
[time=2810] It's not just a momentary thing, it's a whole way of doing things.
[time=2813] It's a transference from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of God's beloved son.
[time=2818] And that kingdom is full of grace.
[time=2820] The parameters are grace.
[time=2822] And so he is saying here, notice, as he writes to them, "I am confident in your growth.
[time=2826] I am confident in your success, not because of me, not my apostleship, not my gifts,
[time=2832] not my talents, not my teaching, not my leadership.
[time=2836] And I am confident in your growth, not because of you, not because of your heart and your integrity and your perseverance and your intelligence and your commitment." He's saying, "My confidence that you will grow and be kept safe all the way until the day of Jesus Christ is because I am confident that he who began a good work in you will perfect it." Who's the he, God?
[time=2859] God started your salvation and God will complete your salvation.
[time=2862] And it all happens in the sphere of grace, grace, saved by grace, kept by grace, fully glorified in grace and forever then to sing the dogs of God.
[time=2874] This verse is so meaningful for me because before I was saved at the age of 20, I lived a horribly sinful life.
[time=2880] The last couple of years of high school and the first years of college, I was involved in things inconceivable, sin, and I realized somewhere in there that it wasn't even me in control anymore.
[time=2890] And I had tried to break free from some of the controlling habits of my life.
[time=2895] And at points I deluded myself to think I was powerful enough to do that.
[time=2899] But realized I was under the control of sin.
[time=2902] I was out of control in the control of sin.
[time=2905] And I couldn't stop my patterns and I couldn't stop my sin and I couldn't repent and I couldn't amend my life.
[time=2914] And then I met Christ and the grace of God not only forgave me of my sins,
[time=2920] but it's the power of the grace of God that took me to levels of maturity.
[time=2925] I would never have known, perfect, absolutely not, free from those problems, absolutely, by the power of the grace of God.
[time=2934] And you see, I met, as you know, with a man named Blaine Gibbs.
[time=2939] And he himself was not some great theologian.
[time=2942] He was not some great mature wise Christian man.
[time=2945] He was a year older or two than I was, had been saved only one year and had struggled before that to come out of the deception of Mormonism and his life he had labored to try to perceive the truth of God's grace instead of the deceptive works orientation of the Mormon church.
[time=2961] He himself also caught in a number of self-destructives, self-defeating sinful habits in his unregenerate days.
[time=2968] And there would be times when we would meet on Friday and we would gather together and we would share the failures of our day and the hardships of our life and the weaknesses of our character and the power of our flesh to overcome our intentions.
[time=2981] And he would have nothing to say and I would have nothing to say.
[time=2985] And all we could do is open our Bibles to Philippians 1, 6.
[time=2990] And hang on to the grace of God.
[time=2993] It is the grace of God we would say to ourselves that caused us to be born again.
[time=2999] God has started the work, you see it there.
[time=3002] It is he who began a good work in you.
[time=3005] And we would say that it must be that same God who will commit to perfect us even until Christ comes again.
[time=3015] There was the assurance and the hope and we could have faith in nothing else, certainly not ourselves, certainly not in him as the disciple or certainly not in me as the disciple only in God and the power of his grace to perfect the keep.
[time=3030] That is what he is saying.
[time=3034] Back to Philippians 4.
[time=3036] That is what he is offering.
[time=3039] That is what he is reminding.
[time=3040] That is what he is wishing on them.
[time=3041] The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
[time=3046] He says this is my last official written contact with you but it is not the end of God's work in your life.
[time=3054] Where I stop, where I have contributed, remember it has been God and God will stay with you.
[time=3062] So in conclusion let me just draw this letter to an end by saying this.
[time=3067] Very fitting that he should say the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3070] That catches some of us by surprise because typically it is the grace of God in the Word of God.
[time=3075] But fitting here, do you know how many times the Lord is referenced?
[time=3079] Jesus Christ is referenced in the book of Philippians over 40 times.
[time=3085] 40 times in four chapters Jesus Christ's name appears on the pages of this book.
[time=3092] He is all this book is about.
[time=3095] This book begins with him and ends with him.
[time=3098] He is the theme.
[time=3099] He is the great passion of this book.
[time=3101] Let me remind you Paul describes himself as a slave of Christ.
[time=3105] The Philippians are addressed as saints in Jesus Christ.
[time=3108] Paul discusses his imprisonment this way.
[time=3110] My bonds are in Jesus Christ.
[time=3113] When he talks about life he says for me to live his Christ.
[time=3118] When he exhorts to godly conduct he says be like Christ.
[time=3121] When he calls for a proper attitude he says have the mind of Christ.
[time=3124] When he talks about his choices, his desires and he hopes he says they are built on trust in Christ.
[time=3130] When he offers his joy it is joy in Christ's strength.
[time=3133] It is the strength of Christ.
[time=3135] When he calls for power and knowledge and fellowship it is the knowledge of Christ, the power of Christ and the fellowship of his sufferings that he longs for.
[time=3144] When he speaks of his hope for eternal glory it is because he is looking for Christ.
[time=3149] When he strives for spiritual steadfastness and contentment he does it in Christ.
[time=3153] When he says I am sufficient he says I am sufficient in Christ.
[time=3156] And here finally he says we are totally and completely dependent on the grace of Christ.
[time=3161] It is all about Christ.
[time=3164] The whole letter has just Jesus Christ written over the tops of the pages.
[time=3170] But it is how Christ intersects with us in our moment of need.
[time=3174] It is how Christ intersects with us in the trials and the hardships of our life and produces in us purpose and joy and meaning.
[time=3184] But it is ultimately about Christ.
[time=3189] The grace of Christ, John spoke of the grace of Christ in the Gospel of John.
[time=3195] John stands at the end of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament.
[time=3199] And as he looks back over the landscape of the Old Testament he sees the law being handed on tablets of stone to Moses and God of course did that so the people would realize they were sinful and could never earn their way to salvation.
[time=3211] From there it went to the Levitical offerings and the priesthood.
[time=3215] And over and over and over again sacrifices were made thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of times as the overwhelming witness of the people of Israel that they could not keep the law of God.
[time=3225] With time the Pharisees took charge and invented 600 new laws of their own and reversed the whole thing around and said you can be righteous before God if you will just obey these laws.
[time=3233] All the ones of the Old Testament plus the 600 that we've added to it.
[time=3237] And so by the time of Christ appearing the people were burdened down and loaded and heavy laden with the legalism of their false religious system and they were deceived thinking that they could earn heaven and work their way into pleasure with God.
[time=3251] Until finally a lean figure from Nazareth cast his shadow on the religious scene of his day.
[time=3257] His name was Jesus Christ and John wrote of him and said this and we beheld his glory.
[time=3262] The glory as of the only begotten of the Father, here is his description, full of grace and truth.
[time=3270] Do you hear it? Jesus Christ, full of grace and truth.
[time=3274] Grace to say you can't do it by works.
[time=3278] Grace of Christ, he is full of grace, he is full of forgiveness, full of mercy and he is full of truth. To write our minds and to free us from the burdening misunderstanding that you could earn pleasure in the sight of God.
[time=3294] So it is a grand letter to the Christian. Philippians, I'd hate to try to live without it. I'd hate for someone to rob me of the truth and the joy and the privilege of understanding the truth that fills these pages.
[time=3306] It is at the same time a warning to unbelievers.
[time=3314] It is at the same time a warning to those who do not know Christ and the people who have not come to terms with the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3322] There is a painting in a cathedral in Lubbock, Germany.
[time=3326] The painting is entitled "The Lament of Jesus Christ Against the Ungrateful World." You see, when Christ offers you everything, if you spurned that offer, you have nothing. When Christ is the only answer, when you reject Christ, you have no answer. When Christ is the only way and you say no to that way, you have no way.
[time=3346] The Lament of Jesus Christ Against the Ungrateful World, and under the painting there is an caption that goes with it. It says this, "You call me master and obey me not. You call me light and see me not. You call me the way and walk me not. You call me life and live me not. You call me wise and follow me not. You call me fair and love me not. You call me rich and ask me not.
[time=3366] You call me eternal and seek me not.
[time=3370] If I condemn thee, blame me not." In Christ we have everything.
[time=3378] Out of Christ we have nothing. It's just that simple.
[time=3382] Let's pray together.
[time=3404] Well, it's clear, isn't it, that all of our life is bound up in the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=3414] and we trust that if you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ, you'll take a moment even now and invite him into your heart.
[time=3420] Let's pray together. Father, we're thankful for the provision that we have in Christ, the forgiveness of our sins, and not just forgiveness, but a life that we can live here on earth through His power and for His glory.
[time=3432] I desire to have Christ come into my heart, to be my Savior.
[time=3436] I ask Him to do that now and ask that your guide and lead me so that I can bring glory and honor to your name. Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3444] Well, if you've made a decision today, we'd love for you to write us and let us know the nature of that decision so we can send you some follow-up material and God bless you as you continue to live for His glory.
