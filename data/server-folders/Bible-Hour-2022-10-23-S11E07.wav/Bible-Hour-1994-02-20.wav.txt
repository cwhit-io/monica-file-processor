[time=12] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=21] Thank you for joining us.
[time=23] In the Letter to the Hebrews, Christians are called to give great thought and energy and finding ways to provoke and even irritate each other to love and good deeds.
[time=33] Well today Pastor Moore draws from what God has been teaching him and his personal walk to give us five lessons to live by from God's Word.
[time=41] Our special music today will be provided by Margie Isaacson and Ed Richard.
[time=49] [MUSIC]
[time=53] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=57] [MUSIC]
[time=73] In the stillness of my soul, I reflect to see.
[time=85] Are you love and love as wrong and who desire me?
[time=95] Let's come on for all He's done, let's come on Christ His Son.
[time=107] Let us identify Him for His holy, rolling on doors in unity.
[time=123] One voice of grace to me, with hearts of all that worship me, we'll sing.
[time=136] Let's go on.
[time=140] [MUSIC]

[time=206] Let us know, let's come on for all He's done, let's come on Christ His Son.
[time=222] Let us identify Him for His holy, rolling on doors in unity.

[time=251] Let us go on.
[time=256] Let us know, let's come on Christ His Son.
[time=270] Let us identify Him for His holy, rolling on doors in unity.
[time=285] Let us sing You for the voice of grace to me, with hearts of all that worship we will sing.
[time=299] Let us go on.
[time=302] We will sing Heaven's Son, we will sing Heaven's Son, let's come on Christ.

[time=359] All you need to do is write us here at the Bible hour.
[time=361] Our address, the Bible hour, 7,400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=367] Now let's return to our service.
[time=389] Just the time I feel that I've been caught in the mile of self.
[time=405] And just the time I feel my mind then what I world me well.
[time=418] That's when the breeze begins to blow.
[time=425] I know the spirit's cold.
[time=431] And all my worldly wonderings just melt into is long.
[time=444] All I want to know you are deep within my soul.
[time=452] I want to know you.
[time=454] All I want to know you to feel your heart and know your mind.
[time=462] Looking in your eyes, stirs and within me.
[time=467] Christ, let's say I want to know you.
[time=473] All I want to know you know.
[time=497] When my daily deeds ordinary whose life and song.
[time=510] My heart begins to bleed sensitivity to hear me as gone.
[time=523] I've run the race but set my pace and face a shattered soul.
[time=535] But the gentle arms of Jesus warm my home brings to be warm.
[time=548] All I want to know you are deep within my soul.
[time=555] I want to know you.
[time=561] All I want to know you know you know.
[time=567] You know you're in your death and resurrection.
[time=570] All I want to know you know.
[time=629] My Jesus, I love you.
[time=634] I know you are one.
[time=639] For you are the follies of sin I reside.
[time=648] My gracious Redeemer.
[time=653] My Savior you are.
[time=658] If ever I loved you.
[time=663] My Jesus is not.
[time=669] I love you because you have first loved me.
[time=679] And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree.
[time=688] I love you for wearing those stones on your brow.
[time=698] If ever I loved you.
[time=703] My Jesus is not.
[time=728] I love you in love.
[time=733] I will love you in death.
[time=738] And praise you as long as you give me breath.
[time=747] In mentions of glory.
[time=751] An endless delight I'll ever adore you.
[time=760] In heaven so bright I'll sing with a glitter.
[time=770] In crown on my bride.
[time=775] If ever I loved you.
[time=780] My Jesus is not.
[time=786] If ever I loved you.
[time=797] My Jesus is not.
[time=812] [AMEN]
[time=818] Thank you Ed.
[time=819] Another tremendous song right to the heart.
[time=823] Well let me invite you this morning to take your Bibles and come to Hebrews chapter 10.
[time=829] The text in front of us here Hebrews 10 verses 23 24 and 25 is somewhat familiar and it really sets a backdrop for what we're going to do this morning.
[time=838] Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful.
[time=844] And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another all the more as you see the day drawing near.
[time=857] The word consider how to stimulate the word consider there means literally to place the mind down upon something.
[time=865] It's talking about a thoughtful time where you stop your mind
[time=871] and it's being engaged in other things and you stop and you think about how to stimulate other people to love and good deeds.
[time=877] To consider thoughtfully or prayerfully.
[time=880] The other word there to stimulate is the word could have been translated to irritate.
[time=886] It's a provoking stimulating, irritating process whereby having stopped and thought how we could provoke each other we then engage each other and sometimes that is somewhat irritating in the process.
[time=898] I find these verses even more interesting when I realize that this book has written to a bunch of Hebrews, a bunch of people who have been raised in the old covenant.
[time=909] They've now come to Christ and they don't know why to go to church anymore.
[time=913] They're struggling with why they're supposed to assemble together because everything they remember by way of that gorgeous ornate temple and everything they remember by way of their sacrifices and the Levites who were dressed wonderfully as prescribed in the Old Testament and their ceremonial robes and the defined sequence of worship for them is now gone.
[time=937] The old form has been thrown away and they don't know how to worship anymore.
[time=940] They don't know why they're supposed to assemble because it's no longer entrapped or given expression to depending upon the perspective of that beautiful temple and sacrifices and the priests.
[time=951] Now they just come even on a different day of the week to somebody's house.
[time=956] You know what I mean?
[time=957] Just somebody's house because they hadn't had time to build these kind of structures and they hadn't really had time to find their way into a new way of worship.
[time=965] And they were in danger of falling away partly because they'd lost the sense of what it was about.
[time=972] Why do I worship and how do I worship?
[time=974] And so the writer of the book of Hebrews says, "Consider, ponder, think, premeditate.
[time=982] Give diligent effort in your mind how you can provoke one another to love and good deeds and do that as you are assembling together." And of course at the end of verse 25 that you might be encouraging one another.
[time=996] And so really like no other time, and this is what I mean to say that this passage provides a backdrop for what I want to do this morning, when we move to the topical, when we're in a book study the curriculum is laid out for me.
[time=1010] I just go in my office on Tuesday and figure out, okay, that's the topic.
[time=1013] And so what does that mean and how do I say it?
[time=1015] I get to share my life as I can through that text.
[time=1018] But when we're away from a text, when we're away from a particular book study, there is this unique burden and pressure and delight really for me to step back and say, "What can I share with the people of Blackhawk that will stimulate them?
[time=1030] How can I consider what might provoke them to love and good deeds?"
[time=1036] What does God want me to say?
[time=1038] Was my question or a rather to him?
[time=1040] What God do you want me to say to the people of Blackhawk in this series of topical messages?
[time=1044] Sometimes I'll talk about what God is teaching me about the church and I'll share that with you.
[time=1055] This morning I want to explain to you what God is teaching me about me.
[time=1061] What God is doing in my life, five things that God is doing in my life.
[time=1067] I've entitled this message "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."
[time=1073] I think it was that Clint Eastwood Western way back when one of those really cheap budget flicks,
[time=1079] "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly," and it just popped into my mind as I wrote down these five things that I wanted to share with you to teach you out of my life that God has been teaching me because two of them were kind of good and kind of exciting.
[time=1091] Two of them were bad and one of them was just really ugly and so here we go,
[time=1097] "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." And before I even do that I want to remind you that Paul would often do this with his congregations.
[time=1105] He would teach them out of the experience of his own life.
[time=1107] Remember Philippians, he was in prison and the whole first chapter is all about his experience as it related to his own life and the truth that came out of that.
[time=1115] And over in 2 Corinthians 1 he tells the Corinthians he was even to the point of death and his struggling for them and so there is, I think, precedence for the preacher to share out of his own life the things that God might be instructing them and I hope you'll hear it in that light.
[time=1131] The first thing, one of the first goods, it's this and I try to write these in principle forms so you can write them down and ponder them in your own life.
[time=1139] The closer I get to people, the closer I get to people, the better I can see the handy work of God.
[time=1147] The closer I get to people, the better I can see the handy work of God.
[time=1152] Now, Psalm 19 says that the heavens are telling of the glory of God and the expanse is declaring the work of his hand.
[time=1161] We know from the Word of God and from our own experience that the creation is this marvelous megaphone
[time=1167] to the eternal attributes of God and he delights in revealing his eternal attributes to we who love him
[time=1174] and even to pagans who don't know him that he exists, that he is an awesome, wonderful, powerful creator
[time=1180] and we certainly can learn about God from creation.
[time=1184] We also know that the Word of God is the primary source whereby we learn specific revelation about God.
[time=1192] In fact, that's where we put most of our attention to understand God is from the Word of God.
[time=1197] But I have been learning in these last few months the simple principle that the closer I get to people,
[time=1203] the better I can see the handy work of God.
[time=1207] I can see his work in people's lives individually and specifically as he ministers to them,
[time=1215] as he provides for their needs, physical and spiritual and relational, as he causes them to grow.
[time=1223] In my first several months here in Fort Wayne coming up here on three years now,
[time=1233] the Lord allowed me to lead a couple of guys to the Lord.
[time=1236] Too many times I led people to the Lord and then they went and moved somewhere else or they went to a different church
[time=1244] and I didn't hear about them for a while or I was just kind of like street evangelism and I prayed with them there and I would walk away and wonder if that confession of faith was real.
[time=1252] I wonder if they really got saved there or if they just said some words.
[time=1257] And so something went in my heart when I, different times for both of these guys, and I just felt challenged to invite them into a discipling relationship so that I could work with them and grow them.
[time=1268] And in the back of my mind, one of the things I wanted to know was, what was the confession of faith real?
[time=1272] Did it really take what we've been going at it now for a couple of years?
[time=1278] But through the holidays, you know, the Christmas tree, living Christmas tree schedule and then just people having family, they had schedule problems, I had schedule problems, we decided not to meet through the holidays and then all through the month of January we had some other schedule problems and then all the way through the most of the month of February we had some more schedule problems.
[time=1295] By the time everything was said and done, we hadn't met with each other for two and a half months.
[time=1301] And I began to wonder about them.
[time=1303] I began to worry.
[time=1305] I began to think gee whiz.
[time=1307] I wonder if because we're not meeting, they're going to become hardened in their relationship to God.
[time=1313] I wonder if because we're not meeting and studying the Bible, they're going to begin to drift away and fall back into some sin in their life.
[time=1319] I wonder if, in fact, some of these scheduling problems aren't really already the evidence of a hardened heart and they don't want to get back together.
[time=1330] Well, finally, we were able to meet just last week.
[time=1335] And I was a little bit nervous, you know, and I said to the first guy, I said, how's it going?
[time=1342] And he said fine.
[time=1343] And it was kind of an edge to it, kind of a distance to it.
[time=1346] Oh, I was nervous.
[time=1347] Good night, you know, here we go.
[time=1349] I said, well, what do you mean by that?
[time=1351] And he began to tell me a series of really difficult things that have been going on in his life.
[time=1356] Lost his job again.
[time=1359] And this time fallen completely out of management into a basic, you know, hands-on work-type job, which is fine.
[time=1367] But for him, he feels his gifts are in management and God had taken that away from him.
[time=1371] And it was really hard.
[time=1372] The labor was just different.
[time=1374] And he had felt kind of stripped of his way of working and his way of ministering.
[time=1380] Because he lost his job again, it wasn't paying as well.
[time=1383] And so there were the financial pressures that were filling his life.
[time=1387] And you know what those are like.
[time=1388] Man, it's just like a dark cloud follows you all over town every day when you have financial stress.
[time=1394] And then he said, and I found a lump in my skin.
[time=1398] And I went to the doctor and had to check it out and he thinks it could be cancer.
[time=1401] So I'm waiting now to, he said to go to see a specialist, to see if in fact it is cancer.
[time=1409] But then he started to say how he felt about it.
[time=1412] I said, well, so tell me what man, how are you handling this?
[time=1416] There was like music to my ears.
[time=1418] He said, well, you know what, I really believe God's in control of my life.
[time=1422] I really believe that since I gave my life to Christ, he's in control of my life.
[time=1427] He says, I really haven't been worrying very much about it because there's no sense in worrying about it.
[time=1431] And it doesn't do anybody any good.
[time=1432] And it just reflects a lack of trust in my heart towards God.
[time=1436] My ears are just getting you accused.
[time=1438] You hear this guy speaking truth?
[time=1440] Truth, I certainly hadn't taught him.
[time=1442] Truth, we hadn't covered in our discipleship times.
[time=1446] He said, you know, I believe that in all of this stuff what God has really tried to do is work on my character.
[time=1452] And if this is the way God wants to work on my character, so be it.
[time=1456] I'm ready to go.
[time=1458] Man, turn with me to 1 John 2 for a minute.
[time=1464] 1 John 2, let me show you.
[time=1467] One of the things that happens when you get close to people.
[time=1470] You get to watch the handy work of God through his spirit as he teaches people things on his own.
[time=1480] The master teacher, Jesus Christ, sends his spirit and the spirit teachers.
[time=1484] You know the whole book of 1 John trying to decipher out these false teachers?
[time=1488] And John is writing to his readers saying, verse 26 of chapter 2, "And this is the promise which he himself made to us eternal life."
[time=1498] Verse 26, "These things I have written to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you." Now watch, verse 27, "As for you, the anointing which you receive from him abides in you.
[time=1509] And you have no need for anyone to teach you.
[time=1512] But as his anointing teaches you about all things, it is true and is not a lie.
[time=1518] And just as it has been taught you, you abide in him." He's saying that because of the Holy Spirit, we can be taught directly by the Spirit of God in the inner man.
[time=1531] Now he obviously is not saying that we don't need to be taught the Word of God.
[time=1535] That's what he's doing. He's writing a book in the Word of God.
[time=1537] He's not saying we don't need preachers and teachers and Sunday school teachers. He's not saying we don't need to study the Word of God diligently.
[time=1543] What he is emphasizing here is that as the intake of the Word of God has occurred, then the ministry of the Spirit of God can take on a unique ministry to bear the truth of particular general truth in the life of that individual and make it relevant and make it clear and make it their own.
[time=1561] And that's what was going on in this guy's life.
[time=1564] He had heard general truth. He had heard some things about these various topics.
[time=1569] But it was the unique personal ministry of the Holy Spirit, the handy work of God on his soul that was making it real and relevant and vital and he was living by it.
[time=1581] Another guy that I've been working with that's been a great joy.
[time=1585] Pretty much through last summer to the end of this last year, his life has just been a wreck.
[time=1591] I mean an absolute wreck, living recklessly, throwing his life away, his family, his employment, his reputation, just a wreck, just a mess.
[time=1601] All the time I'm in there trying to help this individual saying, you know, why and how can I help you and how can I pray for you?
[time=1608] Even meeting on a relatively regular basis. No response.
[time=1614] But suddenly something happens in his heart. Something in his heart of all places.
[time=1620] Place I can't touch. The Spirit of God touches.
[time=1625] And I'm here to tell you the last two months as this guy and I meet together on a weekly basis, the stuff that comes out of his mouth is unbelievable because the Spirit of God is teaching him truth and applying it to his life.
[time=1637] I say, how are you feeling about this? How are you thinking about this? Tell me about this situation and he begins to describe it.
[time=1644] And I'm telling you, I could go from topic to topic as he talks and see, oh, that truth is right here in this book and that truth is over here in this verse and that truth is over here in this verse.
[time=1652] And he has never read those verses before.
[time=1657] Spirit of God.
[time=1661] I believe with all my heart friends, you are missing one of the greatest avenues to see the handy work of God in all the created order, as blessed as the heavens are, as blessed as the Word of God is.
[time=1674] If you are not close enough to people's lives to watch the personal, unique teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit alive and active in their life.
[time=1684] That's good number one. Good number two. I wish I could make the goods longer. We'd run out of time for the bad and the ugly.
[time=1692] Number two.
[time=1694] Number two, don't be afraid.
[time=1697] Don't be afraid to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit because sometimes it's more than just an impulse.
[time=1713] What am I trying to say in that little sentence? Come with me to Romans chapter 8.
[time=1720] Romans chapter 8.
[time=1727] There's a beautiful verse here. Romans chapter 8 verse 14.
[time=1734] It says there, "For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God."
[time=1742] Here's a unique ministry that the Spirit of God has in the life of the believer, and it is to lead the believer.
[time=1749] Now you and I get nervous when people say things like, "Well, the Holy Spirit is telling me to go to such-and-such college."
[time=1759] Or, "The Holy Spirit has told me that I'm supposed to marry that person."
[time=1766] Or, "The Holy Spirit has told me that I'm supposed to take this job instead of that job."
[time=1772] When I hear those words, I get very nervous because I don't find any biblical support for that kind of specific,
[time=1779] dogmatic, convincing, prophetic ministry of the Spirit whereby he removes from us the necessity to walk by faith,
[time=1787] use good wisdom, apply the truth in the Word of God, seek the wisdom of counselors.
[time=1792] I see no place in the New Testament where you and I can bank on the Holy Spirit in advance giving a certain and sure knowledge
[time=1800] of how we are supposed to decide on particular issues.
[time=1804] In fact, the Bible typically, when it talks about that we are led by the Spirit as it does here in Romans 8.14,
[time=1810] it is in the context of being set free from sin, the general category of sin.
[time=1816] You remember the argument of Romans 6, 7, and 8, it's the whole struggle against the flesh and being free from the power of sin and living obediently?
[time=1823] Chapter 8, verse 15, "For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, "Aba, Father." The leading of the Spirit is more a general dynamic and a power that is within us that leads us out of sin
[time=1841] and into the behavior of righteousness.
[time=1845] And so when anybody tries to tell me in advance that they know the Holy Spirit is leading them to do something,
[time=1854] I back up and I get nervous.
[time=1860] But there is something to looking back, isn't there?
[time=1865] There is something to turning around for a moment and reflecting on what God has been doing in your life,
[time=1871] and there are times when you can sense that He had prompted you to do something,
[time=1877] and as the situation plays out, it seems obvious that it wasn't just your own impulse, your own thought process, your own desire.
[time=1885] It was the Holy Spirit tapping you on the shoulder and saying minister to that person.
[time=1891] And we really only can have a level of certainty about that as we look behind us, not as we look forward.
[time=1898] Now I want to encourage you, as the statement says, do not be afraid to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit because sometimes,
[time=1906] sometimes, it's more than just an impulse.
[time=1913] Now for the bad, there's the good, here's the two bad ones.
[time=1919] There's more to accountability than meets the eye.
[time=1924] It's a matter of the heart.
[time=1927] Would you come with me to the book of James, chapter 5?
[time=1934] As you know, when I moved here to Fort Wayne, I found myself in a particularly vulnerable position because for the six or seven years prior to my moving to Fort Wayne,
[time=1948] I had come to understand the value of committed community.
[time=1956] People, four or five, six people who really want to be in committed community together and who are willing to spend time together on a regular basis to talk about what's really going on in their life.
[time=1969] And I was drawing on relationships I'd had there for 13 or 14 years and I had a group of guys that I was doing that with and I knew when I moved to Fort Wayne that the long distance thing wasn't going to work.
[time=1981] And if I didn't have those groups of guys in my life, I was going to be in trouble.
[time=1985] And so by God's grace and through prayer and what I look back now and view as the obvious leading of the Holy Spirit, the Lord led me to some guys.
[time=1996] We meet every week, usually at lunch time, from about 1130 to 1.
[time=2001] We don't so much study the Bible, we come in and talk about our lives.
[time=2006] You see, in over a period of time you get to get us like a spiritual character blueprint on the other guys because you listen to their life and you listen to their struggles and you listen to their joys and you begin to pick up who they are, a spiritual blueprint.
[time=2022] Well, we thought we were doing pretty good with that, but we needed more because we kind of were afraid we were rationalizing with ourselves when we were talking about how we were treating our wives because, you know, we can kind of paint a rose-colored picture of that.
[time=2033] Selective perception, I think it's called.
[time=2036] So we thought we'd do better if we just got our wives involved.
[time=2039] So then we added another meeting once a week on an evening and we included our wives.
[time=2044] And the question we tend to ask each other is this.
[time=2046] How did you love your spouse this week?
[time=2049] What a ridiculous question.
[time=2051] Especially when the partner's sitting there.
[time=2054] You understand, you're accountable.
[time=2057] You give your version, she gives your version and sometimes there are millions of miles apart, which is why we like it because we're really committed to trying to pursue that love relationship.
[time=2069] Some of the best times of my being here for Wayne are wrapped around those groups of people.
[time=2077] But once again, we get into the holidays, holidays get busy, and then one of the couples left town moved somewhere, so we kind of put the thing on hold and week after week after week, we'd see each other around and say, you know, we really ought to be getting together again.
[time=2091] We really ought to be getting together again.
[time=2095] It's been two and a half months.
[time=2098] And my life now, actually my heart is a little bit like this pencil.
[time=2103] We were at the leadership meeting yesterday with all the deacons, the senior staff, and the elders, and we were going to take that survey, you know, that the church is taking, and so we set some time aside to take that.
[time=2111] And you needed number two pencils, and I forgot that.
[time=2114] I remembered the surveys, but I forgot the pencils.
[time=2116] And so I said to Steve Longbrake, who administrates our school, do we have any pencils around here, and he said, sure, he was gone like a flash and came back with this whole box of brand new pencils.
[time=2123] All sharpened up beautiful.
[time=2125] And he brought wind though, another box of erasures that you'd stick on top.
[time=2129] And I looked at this pencil, and I said, what in the world, why did you bring the erasers?
[time=2132] This is a great eraser.
[time=2134] He said, try it.
[time=2136] So I made a mark on a piece of paper and tried to erase it, and the thing wouldn't work.
[time=2140] This eraser is hard.
[time=2143] See, he said to me, these pencils are so old that the erasers aren't good anymore.
[time=2149] The eraser is harder than the wood, okay?
[time=2153] It tore my paper.
[time=2159] It's my heart.
[time=2163] It's the process of my heart right now.
[time=2165] It's oxidizing.
[time=2167] It's getting harder every single day.
[time=2170] A eraser needs to be soft to cover the sins of another person, to make up for the difference, to have compassion, to remove the blotch of sin in their life.
[time=2181] We need soft, hearted, compassionate people, but when we distance ourselves from the process described here in James 5, I'm going to explain to you a minute, we enter ourselves not into a stable position of just standing still spiritually.
[time=2196] We enter the process of oxidation, and our heart begins to get hard, and if you let it go long enough, it becomes useless.
[time=2205] It becomes useless.
[time=2208] Look at James 5, 16.
[time=2211] Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed.
[time=2221] The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
[time=2226] That word confess is the usual word for confess in the Greek, which means to say the same thing about your sin as God does.
[time=2234] You still agree with God about your sin, but it's in a compound form, and it has a preposition on the front of it, the preposition "eck," which means "out."
[time=2242] So what it's saying is to say out, to be open, to communicate with another person about the way you are agreeing with God about your sin.
[time=2254] This verse indicates to us that it's not enough to be confessing our sin to God in the privacy of our prayer chamber, which is a necessary reality.
[time=2263] Psalm 32, Psalm 51.
[time=2266] There is a dynamic that must be going on in the Christian community whereby believers can confess, speak out, and openly agree with God about their own sin to one another.
[time=2278] It doesn't say the sins that you committed against that other brother.
[time=2281] There are other verses in the Bible that describe how to humble yourself before another brother.
[time=2285] That's not the context, and that's not the meaning.
[time=2288] It's calling us to be in a level of committed community to one another whereby we are speaking out what we are agreeing with God about our own sins.
[time=2297] Notice it says "your sins," which means it's not a general confession to your friends, boy, I'm a sinner.
[time=2306] Boy, this is where it's hitting me this week. This is where it's at. This is where I'm getting hard. This is where I'm failing. This is where I'm struggling.
[time=2315] Why? Look at the verse so they can pray for you.
[time=2319] So they can pray for you so that you can be healed.
[time=2323] That word healed can mean physical healing, and there is something in the context to indicate physical illness in verses 13 and 15, but it's also used in other places in the New Testament.
[time=2333] Matthew 13, John 20, Hebrews 12, where that word healed is not talking about a physical ailment, it's talking about a disease that inflicts the soul.
[time=2343] Your soul can be healed. Your soul can be improved. Your soul can be softened.
[time=2356] I found through the experience of not meeting with these guys, which by the way, that's been the longest period of time in about the last seven, eight years of my life that I haven't been meeting with people in committed community.
[time=2368] I learned not only do I need to talk about my sin, but I need to hear other people talk about theirs.
[time=2374] Not for malicious gossip, not for one-upsmanship. I find that when I hear a true, genuine believer confessing his own sin and his own failings before God, something happens to my own heart that softens it.
[time=2388] And I get an insight and I get to be strengthened by their courage and their strength and their willingness to be open and their willingness to repent and return to God.
[time=2403] So there is more to accountability than meets the eye. It's a matter of the heart.
[time=2414] Principle number two under the bad goes like this. No matter how much I grow in my relationship with God, no matter how much I grow in my relationship with God, it always goes back to the basics.
[time=2430] Proverbs 25 for a minute. There's a verse in that proverb that haunts me over and over again. Proverbs 25 verse 28.
[time=2451] Proverbs 25, 28 says this like a city that is broken down into and without walls is a man who has no control over his own spirit.
[time=2460] In the day in which this verse was written, the only fortification and the only protection a city had were its walls.
[time=2466] A city without walls was utterly at the whim of those who would come and marade and destroy and kill and take.
[time=2474] The people inside that city who were not properly walled knew they could not protect their family, they could not protect their possessions, they could not protect the things that meant the most to them in the world.
[time=2484] When the walls of a city are broken down, it's melee. Nehemiah, when he was in the Babylonian captivity, when he heard that the walls of Jerusalem had not been rebuilt, you know what he did?
[time=2496] He sat down and he wept because he loved that city and he loved the people of those city and he knew as long as the walls were not up, their doom was imminent.
[time=2506] And they would be subject to all kinds of disasters and trials and hardships. You get the picture?
[time=2513] When you and I lose our self-discipline, when our ability to say yes to the right things goes down and our ability to say no to the right things goes down and we lose our personal self-discipline, we are compared to an ancient city whose walls are down.
[time=2531] And now anyone can come and take from us what is meaningful and what we care about.
[time=2542] Been an interesting couple of months, this thing called cabin fever is taking on a whole new meaning in my life.
[time=2549] I really want you to know I'm praising God because I did better this winter than last winter and I think I'm going to do better next winter than I did this winter.
[time=2558] I think God is giving me grace. I used to get angry. My first winter here, I would try to get from that door to my car in the parking lot and I'd get the door open if it wasn't frozen shut.
[time=2571] And I'd sit down and I found out that the pants, the cloth in my clothes was frozen.
[time=2579] What happened? I'll short walk to my car. I used to get angry at my car because why put a heater in the stupid thing?
[time=2589] By the time I get to the restaurant, it hasn't warmed my car up. You've got to drive half an hour before the thing's warm.
[time=2596] You don't think I'm talking these are real battles in my mind.
[time=2599] Yeah! Call! I would look at my overcoat as I would hang on my door in my office and I had to go outside and I'd say, "I don't want to put you on ever again!"
[time=2610] I'm sick of that overcoat. You understand, you don't wear those in California. Never worn overcoat in my lifetime. I hated it last year.
[time=2619] It's not happening so much anymore. Growing, okay? I'm growing. I wear long underwear now when it's really cold.
[time=2628] Okay? I'm figuring you guys out. Alright.
[time=2635] Alright, so, but it is, it's cabin fever, so here I am and I'm down.
[time=2641] I'm feeling heavy and I'm walking around finding... Do you feel cabin fever?
[time=2646] And some people say yes. I identify. And then some people say no and I hate those people and I don't ever want to talk to them again.
[time=2653] But for those people who feel cabin fever, I say, "What does it feel like to you?" Because I'm trying to figure out is what going on inside of me cabin fever or some other malady that I need real help for, you know?
[time=2665] The best way I've learned to describe cabin fever now and I share my experience with them and they say, "Yeah, that's probably cabin fever. It's like this. It's like I'm in a week. A week that has 72 days."
[time=2677] And it just never gets over. You can call it the weekend, but it doesn't matter. It's just this long week. It never ends.
[time=2687] When I was a kid, we had a pool and we would do what we were not supposed to do. We would throw rocks and pennies in the bottom of the pool and then say go.
[time=2695] And we would race to see how many of those we could pick up. And being the competitive individual that I am, I would often push myself to where I had no more oxygen left in my system, still trying to pick up that last rock.
[time=2706] And push for the CFS and you're struggling wondering, "Did I stay down too long this time? Is my breath going to be water or air?"
[time=2716] And finally you busted the top and that's what the sun felt like to me last week.
[time=2726] Oh, baby.
[time=2739] Well, we know these things. We know these things. We anticipate these things. I was telling myself these things would happen again as I approached the winter.
[time=2749] You know what I've been doing? I've been losing my power to say yes to the right stuff and say no to the right stuff and it's been getting reversed.
[time=2758] I've been saying yes to too much food. I carry about six or seven pounds today that I didn't have in November.
[time=2766] I've been saying yes to too much sleep. I can't seem to drag myself out of bed when I should.
[time=2773] I've been saying no to exercise. I've been saying no to exercise. I ran this week in the sunshine for the first time in two months.
[time=2784] It used to be on a regular workout schedule. It's gone.
[time=2789] Lack of self-control, lack of discipline, lack of priorities, like a city whose walls have fallen down.
[time=2800] Saying yes to too much work. Working way too many hours. Saying to myself, well, the kids will be okay. I spend a lot of time with them through the holidays.
[time=2810] And I won't let this go on very long. It's gone on too long.
[time=2818] You know what I don't care how much you know about the Bible? I don't care how great your faith is.
[time=2823] I don't care what kind of experiences you have had with God. I believe with all my heart.
[time=2830] That your relationship with God always goes back to the basic fundamentals of our Christian faith, having enough self-discipline to do the simple things right on a consistent basis.
[time=2845] Number five, now to the ugly. The good, the bad, and the ugly. Here's my statement.
[time=2853] Well first before I say it, come to Hosea. Hosea chapter 13. Some were back here in the Old Testament.
[time=2865] Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, the first of the minor prophets. Hosea 13.
[time=2874] And the statement is this. Pride, pride still goes before a fall. Nothing's changed.
[time=2886] In case you've wondered, since that proverb was written so many thousands of years ago, pride still goes before a fall.
[time=2895] I don't know what it is about my heart and probably your heart as well. I don't know what it is that when God gives me a little bit of blessing
[time=2902] and makes my life comfortable and allows some of my hopes and dreams to come true, just when he's in the process of blessing me, my heart is in the process of walking out.
[time=2912] You know what I mean? Why is it that it's only when I feel like I'm under pressure and I feel like circumstances are weighing me down.
[time=2920] Why is it only at those times that I feel particularly close? Why can't I come to the place in my Christian life when even when he's blessing me,
[time=2928] I can stay in that point of dependence upon him and feel the reality of my life, blessings or no blessings.
[time=2935] I've got to be vitally linked to him in a sense of absolute dependence.
[time=2940] Hosea 13, verse 4, "Yet I have been the Lord your God since the land of Egypt.
[time=2946] And you were not to know any God except me, for there is no Savior besides me."
[time=2952] Now watch what he says here. "I cared for you in the wilderness, in the land of drought.
[time=2957] As they had their pasture, they became satisfied." Here it is. "And being satisfied, their heart became proud, and they forgot me."
[time=2972] You know what happens so fast and so naturally with me, it's not even like I make a decision to do it.
[time=2977] I just seem to wake up one morning and my heart is far from God, and I feel independent.
[time=2984] And I don't wake up with a prayer on my lips begging for the grace of God to make it through this day in a way that blesses him. I wake up without even a thought of God on my mind.
[time=2995] And instead there is this question usually in my mind, how can I gratify myself today?
[time=3000] What about this day is going to be good for me?
[time=3004] You see in verse 6, "As they had their pasture, meaning as I supplied for them all that they could have wanted,
[time=3011] they became satisfied." Nothing wrong with that. "Being satisfied, their heart became proud,
[time=3018] and then the colossal problem, therefore, they forgot." I want you to know we had one of the greatest Christmases in our life this year here in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=3028] I'm talking about Heidi and our five kids.
[time=3032] We've been able to break away from our folks and the strong family unit that we've loved so much.
[time=3038] Here we've found that we do have a family and we've got some traditions going now that really satisfy us and that really give us a sense of being a co-host of unit together.
[time=3047] And we just rejoiced in that, this best Christmas ever, right here, this last Christmas.
[time=3052] Then, of course, things that work very cheery, very bright.
[time=3055] We went through the lovely living Christmas tree and we saw God do some phenomenal things there.
[time=3059] We came to the year end offering and we almost set some records as far as giving in that category.
[time=3064] Attendance has been good, memberships running along.
[time=3067] We're working with the leadership. We're seeing a vision emerge for the future.
[time=3071] You go, "Man, how could life be any better?" You think you'd fall down on your face day after day after day after day and say, "God, I don't deserve any of it." But became satisfied in their hearts, became proud.
[time=3094] They forgot me.
[time=3096] That subtle shift inside the soul that moves away from God.
[time=3100] You realize it was after David had killed the lion and the bear and the giant
[time=3106] and had become king and had run the first parcel of his administration with unparalleled success.
[time=3112] It was after all of that blessing that he was up on the rooftop when he looked over and saw Bathsheba and invited her over that night and committed the greatest sin of his life.
[time=3122] He became satisfied and he became proud and he forgot his God.
[time=3128] I'm happy to tell you there have been no Bathsheba's in my life, nothing even close.
[time=3135] Good night, God looks at the heart, doesn't he?
[time=3137] Mine's been angry at times, real angry because when you get proud, you begin to become intolerant of people.
[time=3143] And if they don't agree with you right away and if they don't see it your way, you become angry with them for that.
[time=3150] Talking about an attitude in my own heart at times, it feels like I know everything, the beginning from the end.
[time=3155] I know the answers before the questions are asked.
[time=3158] There's no longer a sense of real submissiveness in my heart to the brethren, to the people that I care for, to come into a situation without all the answers and with a great reservoir of patience to try to learn and listen and think and administer to them.
[time=3174] Instead, it's an agitated, angry sense of impatience.
[time=3178] It's what a proud heart does.
[time=3182] As long as we're in the Old Testament, go to one more passage as we close, to Isaiah chapter 66.
[time=3191] Isaiah chapter 66.
[time=3200] Chapter 65 describes the great wonders of the Millennial Kingdom.
[time=3204] God is really on display in that chapter because he's showing how it's supposed to be again and how he has the power to make it that way again, to totally thwart the power of sin.
[time=3214] Remember there in chapter 65 verse 25, "The wolf and the lamb shall graze together
[time=3220] and the lion shall eat straw like the ox and dust shall be the serpent's food.
[time=3225] They shall do no evil or harm in all my holy mountain." That's kind of that grand crescendo to the description of the Millennial Kingdom.
[time=3234] And then he comes on to say, "Talk about himself." And he's the only one that has the right to do this.
[time=3239] Listen to this in verses 1 and 2.
[time=3241] "Thus says the Lord, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.
[time=3246] Where then is a house you could build for me?
[time=3249] And where is a place that I may rest?
[time=3252] For my hand made all these things.
[time=3254] Thus all these things came into being, declares the Lord.
[time=3257] He is saying, "I am so far above and beyond anything you could ever imagine.
[time=3262] I did it all.
[time=3264] I am not only put the Millennial Kingdom in place, but everything before that and everything after that.
[time=3269] As a result, Heaven is my throne.
[time=3270] The earth is my footstool.
[time=3271] You could never build a house for me.
[time=3273] I am so far above you." Read the end of verse 2.
[time=3279] What is an awesome one like that look to be with and look to be for and look to be associated with?
[time=3285] But to this one, I will look to him who is humble and contrite of spirit and who trembles
[time=3294] at my word.
[time=3296] Good night, the God of the universe.
[time=3299] The God of the universe, the awesome one, the I am of all time.
[time=3305] As awesome as he is, says in the same verse, "But you can be great too.
[time=3312] You can be sought after by me, and it won't be because of your accomplishments, and it
[time=3319] won't be because of your appearance, and it won't be because of your anything else about you except your humble and contrite spirit, which produces a natural trembling at the
[time=3331] work of God." How far we stay.
[time=3336] The good, the bad, and the ugly, the closer I get the people, the better I can see the handy work of God.
[time=3342] Don't be afraid to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit sometimes.
[time=3346] It's more than just an impulse.
[time=3349] The bad, there's more to accountability than meets the eye.
[time=3353] It's a matter of the heart.
[time=3356] No matter how much I grow in my relationship with God, it always goes back to the basics.
[time=3363] Pride, my friends, pride still goes before a full.
