[time=0] The one of the greatest texts we're with this morning is one of the greatest texts in all the New Testament, really all the Bible to understand and to gain insight into the doctrine of eternal security, the point of no return once we've come to Christ.
[time=28] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=34] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=36] Thank you for joining us.
[time=37] Can a person be saved at one time in their life and then through some course of events choose to renounce God and become unsaved?
[time=45] Is salvation like a club membership where you need to pay your dues or they throw you out?
[time=50] What if a person stops believing in God and leaves the church?
[time=54] What about a Christian who's put under extreme persecution unless he renounces his faith?
[time=60] Would God ever take someone's salvation away?
[time=63] Can Satan influence God's decision about a Christian keeping or losing his salvation?
[time=68] What about demons?
[time=70] Can they cause someone to lose his salvation?
[time=73] Well stay with us today as Pastor Moore teaches us what the Bible says about these questions regarding eternal security.
[time=80] Our special music today will be provided by Reed LeFavor.
[time=88] Let's join our sanctuary choir and orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=110] [MUSIC - 164 seconds]
[time=300] The Bible hour has something just for you.
[time=304] All through the month of March we're offering this lovely marker free to all viewers who write and request one.
[time=310] We hope you'll put it to good use in your Bible and also let it be a reminder to pray for the Bible hour ministry.
[time=316] To receive your free marker just write us here at the Bible hour.
[time=320] Our address is the Bible hour 7400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana 46815.
[time=327] Drop us a note today. Now let's return to our service.
[time=331] [MUSIC]
[time=340] Amazing grace. How sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[time=360] I once was lost, oh, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see.
[time=379] When we've been there 10,000 years, bright shining as the sun.
[time=396] But we call last days to sing of all God's dreams.
[time=412] Then when we first...
[time=436] Well thank you for joining us for the Bible hour today.
[time=439] This week I told you about a musical and that we were going to show a little bit of the footage and we're going to do that in just a few minutes.
[time=445] The musical will be presented by the praise kids and I have one of the directors in the studio today.
[time=450] Her name is Judy Rodenbank. Judy nice to have you here.
[time=453] Thank you Pete, it's nice to be here.
[time=455] Judy, there are some other people that work very closely with the choir. Tell us who they are.
[time=459] My husband Bob and Ron and Mindy Jones direct the choir.
[time=463] We talked about the choir and the name of the choir, the praise kids, but who are these kids?
[time=468] The praise kids are 4th, 5th, and 6th graders, which means typically they are 10, 11, and 12 year olds.
[time=474] And we do have 62 children participating in our musical this year.
[time=478] Well that's great. We're excited. I love to go in there and see all the excitement those kids give out when they're rehearsing.
[time=486] Now they're going to be presenting a musical entitled The Attic. That's kind of an unusual title.
[time=490] The Attic is a musical where it is a rainy day and they pretend to go up into the Attic.
[time=496] And while they're up there they come across some things that they call prehistoric, which are things from their parents' day and age.
[time=503] And they begin to dress up and disguise themselves.
[time=506] By the end of the musical they realize that pretending is fun, but they eventually have to come back to reality.
[time=513] And it's wonderful that they begin to accept themselves for who they are because they know that God loves them, that they are relevant,
[time=521] and that He does have a special purpose for their lives if they are willing to follow His direction.
[time=527] Sounds like there's more than just learning music that's going on in the praise kids' rehearsal times.
[time=532] That's really exciting. Why do you direct the kids?
[time=536] We really want to stress to the boys and girls that this is their ministry, and this is one way that they can show they love the Lord.
[time=543] That's great. Now I just want to remind you again that that musical will be coming up.
[time=548] And let's take a moment right now and show a clip of the kids rehearsing for the musical The Attic.
[time=554] Can't feel, can't feel, let me tell you how I feel.
[time=560] Don't be certain to be a friend to me if you won't get real.
[time=566] Oh, come on, get real.
[time=574] Can't feel.
[time=577] I just want to remind you that the presentation of The Attic will take place on Sunday evening March 20th at 6 p.m.
[time=585] right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. That will be a great night of music and encouragement to see all of these young people involved in this way.
[time=593] So, come. Once again, that's March 20th at 6 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church in Fort Wayne.
[time=600] The address is 7,400 East State Boulevard. We hope that you'll join us for that night.
[time=606] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our service. I hope you'll stay with us.
[time=636] The city was too soon.
[time=645] And the time was long ago.
[time=652] The people caught him Jesus.
[time=659] The crime was the love that he showed.
[time=666] And I am the one to leave.
[time=673] I caused all of his pain.
[time=679] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=696] He brought us love that only he could give.
[time=708] I brought it cause to cry.
[time=715] And though he taught us how to live, I taught him how to die.
[time=728] And I am the one to blame.
[time=742] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=753] Now he could have called his holy father and said, "Take me away."
[time=762] "Please God, just take me away." And he could have said, "Oh, you see, I'm not even guilty."
[time=771] And I am not going to stay.
[time=774] No, I'm not going to pay.
[time=781] But instead he walked right through that gate and then on up that hill.
[time=800] And as he fell beneath all sins wailed, he cried, "Father, not my will."
[time=816] And I am the one to blame.
[time=830] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=850] I'm the one to blame.
[time=857] I caused all of his pain.
[time=869] He gave himself the day he wore my crown.
[time=890] I'm the one to blame.
[time=911] [AMEN] Thank you, Reed.
[time=914] Let me invite you to take your Bible this morning and come to the Book of Romans 8.
[time=921] We're in a series of topical messages as we're in between book studies.
[time=928] For those of you who were here last week, you realize that we talked about passing the point of no return.
[time=934] That point in a person's life where they have rejected Christ for the last time.
[time=941] And though they continue to live in their physical bodies very much alive, they have passed the point where they could ever accept Christ as Savior.
[time=950] And that was a message of great warning to those in our church who might have had certain acknowledgement of the person of Christ and believing certain things in their head about the Bible and about God and about death and about being a Christian but had never really come to a point of full commitment to Christ.
[time=970] A passage or a message that talked about the grave consequences of delaying that decision and not making a full-hearted commitment to Christ.
[time=978] This morning I want to talk about another point of no return.
[time=981] This one not a warning passage.
[time=983] This one really rather an enjoyable time of rejoicing in the fact that once a person is truly saved, there is no point of return.
[time=992] There is no way to be unsaved.
[time=994] There is no way to get unreborn.
[time=997] There is no way to lose your salvation.
[time=1000] Once a person is truly born again, there is no way to back up and to become unsaved.
[time=1007] This of course is what we refer to as the doctrine of eternal security.
[time=1012] And the passage we have in front of us, Romans 8, verses 31 to 39, really is one of the greatest passages in all the New Testament, the entire Bible really, to understand and think through the great issues of eternal security.
[time=1026] And for your thinking this morning, I'll just offer three points as an outline for these various verses.
[time=1031] Some of the verses we'll look at in detail, others will move rather rapidly over.
[time=1035] But the three points will be these.
[time=1037] We are eternally secure one because of what God has done.
[time=1042] Secondly, we are eternally secure because of what Christ is doing.
[time=1047] And lastly, we are eternally secure because of who the Christian has become.
[time=1052] Who the Christian has become.
[time=1054] First of all, secure because of what God has done, verses 31 and 32.
[time=1060] What shall we say to these things?
[time=1063] If God is for us, who is against us?
[time=1067] He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[time=1078] The main point there is this, if God is for us, who could be against us?
[time=1083] And of course that's a reference to the fact that God is the all powerful judge of the universe and his court is the highest court.
[time=1091] And if his court has declared you innocent, if in fact his court has said we're for you, then it really doesn't matter what anybody else says because he is the highest authority that is.
[time=1102] David in Psalm 27, one said this, "The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?
[time=1111] The Lord is the defense of my life, whom shall I dread."
[time=1117] In other words, if God is my salvation, I have no one to fear because God is the most powerful thing around.
[time=1124] And no one can usurp him, no one can change his decision, no one can overrule him, what he says is final.
[time=1131] There is simply no higher authority, and certainly that's part of what this means.
[time=1137] If God is for us, who is against us?
[time=1140] But there is another aspect to it, which I find rather intriguing, and it's this, because God is holy.
[time=1147] When I sin, my sin is most offensive to him.
[time=1152] There is no one more offended by my sin than God is, because God is the holy one.
[time=1159] And as a result, if he has acquitted me for my sin, the offense of my sin, if the one who has been most offended and most wronged by my sin has said you are forgiven,
[time=1170] then everyone else is also incidental in that light.
[time=1174] That's why I think in Genesis 39, Joseph was being tempted as you remember by a woman who was trying to seduce him into a immoral relationship.
[time=1183] And he finally had to say to her this, but he refused and said to his master's wife, "Behold, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house.
[time=1197] And he has put all that he owns in my charge.
[time=1202] There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife."
[time=1209] And he says this, "How then could I do this great evil and sin against?" And you expect him to say, "Your husband or my master, the one who in fact has put me in charge, the one who in fact has given me full reign in this house."
[time=1224] It's not what he says.
[time=1227] He says, "How could I do this great evil and sin against God?" You say, "Well, why does he lead up like that? Why does he talk about the master and talk about the trust that the master has given him only to climax with this notion?
[time=1243] How could I do this great evil and sin against God?" Because Joseph knew that though his sin would be a violation of that woman, and though his sin would be a violation of his master, it ultimately would be a violation of God.
[time=1255] And that is the point to which he retreats when he declines from sin.
[time=1260] I can't sin.
[time=1261] He says because my sin is ultimately against the only holy being there is, the true and living God.
[time=1268] That's why I believe David in his repentance in Psalm 51 verse 4 says this, "Against the," meaning God, "and the only have I sin."
[time=1277] Well, that's not true.
[time=1279] That's simply not true.
[time=1280] He violated Bathsheba.
[time=1282] He violated Bathsheba's husband.
[time=1284] He violated his own military commander who had to murder him in effect.
[time=1289] He violated everybody else that lived in the land of Israel.
[time=1292] And because Israel was a light to the other nations, he violated every nation on the planet.
[time=1298] He was a strategic man in a strategic place, and he violated directly and indirectly, pretty much everybody on the planet.
[time=1307] That's not what he says.
[time=1309] "Against the and the only have I sin." In other words, he's accentuating the reality that when I sin, the point at which my sin is most sinful, and the point at which it violates the deepest is when it comes into contact with the true and living God, the one to whom I am ultimately responsible.
[time=1326] And so he's saying here in verse 31, "If God is for me, who could be against me?
[time=1331] If the one I have violated most seriously has forgiven my debt to close case."
[time=1338] "If God is for me, who can be against me?" He goes on, though, to answer another possible concern, and it's this.
[time=1349] Well, okay, the person wants to understand that.
[time=1351] If God is for you, then nobody can be against you.
[time=1355] That's clear.
[time=1356] But what happens if God stops being for you?
[time=1362] What happens if there comes a point in your Christian life where God looks at you and says, "Enough is enough.
[time=1367] I'm not for you anymore." That is the straw that broke the camel's back.
[time=1373] You have pushed it too far.
[time=1376] I didn't anticipate you being such a horrible Christian.
[time=1382] What happens if God says, "I'm no longer for you?" Well, that concern is answered in verse 32.
[time=1389] Listen to how it's done.
[time=1390] He who did not spare his own son, but delivered him up for us all, how will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[time=1400] In other words, if God did the greatest thing to redeem us in the giving of his son, will he do lesser things to keep us safe?
[time=1409] He's already paid the greatest price possible for our salvation, the blood of his own son.
[time=1414] If he's already given us the ultimate price for our salvation, do you think he's going to decline from giving what else might be needed to keep us safe?
[time=1423] Of course not.
[time=1425] God isn't going to make the initial upfront investment to redeem you from sin and then fail to continually give the lesser things to keep you secure in salvation.
[time=1434] Doesn't make any sense.
[time=1435] He would never do that.
[time=1436] That's not how God works.
[time=1440] I was at a basketball game here at the high school, Black Hawk, a couple weeks ago.
[time=1444] Sitting there with a friend of mine who goes to the church and that friend had a relative from Chicago, a brother-in-law in fact, and we were having to be sitting next together, me and this brother-in-law, the visitor.
[time=1455] And in a free moment, I just said, trying to get to another guy.
[time=1459] I said, "What do you do for a living?" And I said, "Well, I sell things." I said, "What do you sell?" I said, "Well, I sell oil refineries." I said, "Well, this is the first guy I've ever met that sells oil refineries." I'm thinking that went through my mind for a little bit.
[time=1478] I said, "I guess you have to travel." I said, "Yeah." I said, "Well, how many oil refineries are there that a person could sell?
[time=1484] I mean, how many are there in the world?" And I forget the number that he said.
[time=1486] It wasn't a large number at all.
[time=1488] And then I said, "Well, now, those got to be expensive." He says, "Yeah." I said, "What does a person pay for your average ordinary oil refinery?"
[time=1503] And he said, "Oh, about a billion dollars." That's some kind of an investment.
[time=1510] I mean, you bought something when you bought yourself an oil refinery.
[time=1515] Now, do you think that the company or the people, the investing group, that puts up a billion dollars to buy a piece of dirt with oil underneath it?
[time=1526] When it comes along that the pump breaks and the pump happens to cost two million dollars,
[time=1533] do you think they say, "No, that's it.
[time=1535] I'm not going to spend two million on a pump." Forget it.
[time=1539] A couple hundred thousand dollars for this problem?
[time=1541] No, we're not going to do that.
[time=1542] No, I've just spent enough.
[time=1545] Not on your life.
[time=1547] These little things, these little million dollar bills become absolutely incidental when you consider the total purchase price in the first place.
[time=1557] People who make that kind of an investment stand behind that kind of an investment and tell that investment reaps, it's reward.
[time=1564] And God is not about to redeem you with the precious blood of his own son.
[time=1569] And then between now and the time you can get to heaven, fail to give the additional resources so that he can reap the reward of your being in heaven with him forever.
[time=1578] Does it make sense?
[time=1580] That's not how God is.
[time=1581] That would be foolish.
[time=1583] He has paid the ultimate price for your salvation.
[time=1586] Will he not, as the verse says, also freely give us all things?
[time=1591] Anything else that's needed to get you safely home, you can count on it because my upfront investment was so intense and so high, I'm going to cover the difference.
[time=1601] That's what he's saying.
[time=1603] If God is for us, who could be against us?
[time=1606] Nobody.
[time=1607] If the one we have violated the most has forgiven us, what else can be said?
[time=1612] Well, okay.
[time=1613] But what happens if God doesn't want to be with you?
[time=1615] Well, forget that notion.
[time=1616] He's already made the upfront initial investment.
[time=1618] It cost him, I love the phrase, his own son.
[time=1621] It's a way to express his own private possession.
[time=1624] He gave you something you didn't need, you had no, you needed.
[time=1627] He gave you something you couldn't require, you had no way to bargain for this.
[time=1631] He gave you out of his own private possession, his son, and you had no claims to his son, but he freely delivered him up.
[time=1638] The picture here is of the Old Testament and Isaac being offered by Abraham.
[time=1643] And you know, God wanted to test Abraham's commitment to God.
[time=1648] God was a little concerned that Abraham had fixed his attention on the son of promise, and that that was the new point of allegiance in his life.
[time=1655] And God doesn't like that, God's a jealous God.
[time=1657] And God wanted Abraham's total affection and commitment to be with God.
[time=1661] And so God said, I'm going to test you, put your son on the altar and lift the knife and drive it through his heart, delivered him up.
[time=1668] And the striking parallel that goes on there between Isaac and Christ.
[time=1674] Isaac was a picture of Christ, Isaac liked Christ, was an only son.
[time=1678] Isaac liked Christ, was a child of promise.
[time=1681] Isaac liked Christ, was the one in whom all the nations of the earth would eventually be blessed.
[time=1686] Isaac liked Christ, was the one through whom salvation would eventually come.
[time=1690] Isaac liked Christ, was offered up as a sacrifice, but there is this one fundamental difference.
[time=1697] Abraham never had to drop the knife.
[time=1699] An angel came and said, don't do that.
[time=1702] There was a ram that was provided for the sacrifice, and his son got to get off the altar and a ram was provided.
[time=1708] That didn't happen with God.
[time=1710] Nobody said to the Roman soldier, don't drive the nail.
[time=1715] The nails were driven, Christ was crucified.
[time=1719] God has given you his own son.
[time=1724] Don't be so foolish as to think he would withhold anything else that you need to get safely to heaven.
[time=1730] That's the point.
[time=1732] You're home free, friend.
[time=1733] You are home free.
[time=1735] God will not turn his back on you, primarily because of his love for his own son.
[time=1743] Secondarily because of his love for you.
[time=1747] Awesome, isn't it?
[time=1749] Secondly, you're secure because of what Christ is doing.
[time=1754] What Christ is currently doing, look at verses 33 and 34.
[time=1759] Who will bring a charge against God's elect?
[time=1762] God is the one who justifies.
[time=1764] Who is the one who condemns?
[time=1766] Christ Jesus is he who died, yes, rather, who was raised, who was at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.
[time=1774] You've got to kind of get a picture here.
[time=1777] There's somebody bringing a charge against God's elect, against the Christian.
[time=1781] That person bringing the charge in verse 34 is trying to get a conviction.
[time=1785] He wants them condemned.
[time=1788] So you have a courtroom situation and there is a judge and then there is a prosecuting attorney, if you will, bringing charges against the Christian and trying to say the Christian needs to be condemned to death.
[time=1799] He doesn't deserve heaven.
[time=1800] He doesn't deserve forgiveness.
[time=1801] There is this defense attorney who is Christ and his job is to intercede for us at the
[time=1808] end of verse 34.
[time=1809] So you have the definite notion of a courtroom setting.
[time=1811] Now we don't know a lot about how this works.
[time=1813] The Bible doesn't let us see much of it.
[time=1815] We have a few glimpses.
[time=1817] In Revelation chapter 12, 10, Satan is called the accuser of the brethren.
[time=1822] One of the things that Satan does, so much so that he earns a title for it, is he accuses the brethren.
[time=1828] He is in the process of bringing charges against God's children in the presence of God to try
[time=1834] to get the decision reversed.
[time=1839] In Zechariah 3, we see Joshua, the high priest, standing in there with the angel of the Lord,
[time=1845] and also there is Satan, and Satan is accusing Joshua.
[time=1850] We also see in Job 1, obvious and very familiar passage, Satan has gained an audience with
[time=1859] God, and he says, "Listen, Job doesn't really love you." That's the accusation.
[time=1864] So implied, overturn your decision to save the man.
[time=1868] He only loves you conditionally.
[time=1870] He only loves you because you give him so many good things.
[time=1874] You stop giving him so many good things, he's out of here, and you know the book of Job.
[time=1878] That was tested, and in fact, Job was found to be true in his heart towards God.
[time=1883] So we don't know a lot about the accusing process.
[time=1886] We know his title is the accuser.
[time=1887] We know that he has access into the throne room of God to make such accusations.
[time=1894] So there is Satan, and he's saying to God, "Russell has no right to heaven."
[time=1900] This man has no business being in heaven forever.
[time=1904] I mean, after all, God, you already saved the guy, and now still look at his life.
[time=1913] He sins.
[time=1914] I mean, look at his heart, look at his mind, look at his words, look at what he says, look at how he fails to love his wife as he should and his children as he should, and people as he ought to.
[time=1923] I mean, God, this is ridiculous.
[time=1925] You've already forgiven him, you've already given him the power of the Holy Spirit, you've given him the word of God, people have discipled him.
[time=1932] I mean, what more could a guy want, and he's still day after day?
[time=1935] Look at this list, I've got God on this guy.
[time=1939] You've got to be nuts.
[time=1941] How could this be justice?
[time=1942] How could there be any equity in this?
[time=1944] Satan is in the business of doing that.
[time=1947] The great news is, I'm going to stay saved because in that same courtroom is my Savior,
[time=1955] Jesus Christ, who intercedes for me.
[time=1957] You see at the Universe 34, Christ intercedes for me.
[time=1962] The word intercedes means to have an audience with a king, and as you've noticed, Christ is at the right hand of the king all the time, so he has a constant audience with God.
[time=1970] And when Satan comes to make his accusations against me, Christ begins to enter seed on my behalf and on your behalf.
[time=1978] I was thinking a little bit about this.
[time=1979] I wonder how he does that.
[time=1981] What does he say?
[time=1982] Well, here's something I don't think he says.
[time=1984] I don't think Christ says this.
[time=1986] I know.
[time=1987] Now, Father, you've got to realize, I mean, keep in mind, that was a very, very tough temptation that he was going through right there.
[time=1994] And that really played to his Achilles heel.
[time=1996] That was a weak spot for the kid.
[time=1998] And it was a weak moment.
[time=1999] He'd been through some hard things that week, and it kind of built up.
[time=2002] His physical strength wasn't, and he fell, you know, and I really think, God, we ought to give the kid a second chance.
[time=2008] He doesn't say that.
[time=2009] I don't think he says that.
[time=2011] Here's the other thing I don't think he says.
[time=2013] Oh, yeah, I know he's sinned, but he said he was sorry.
[time=2017] You've got to admit.
[time=2018] He said he was sorry.
[time=2019] And if he said he was sorry, what more can we ask from the guy?
[time=2022] You know, he's growing.
[time=2023] I mean, he's not as sinful today as he used to be.
[time=2026] I just don't think we can throw this one out, Lord.
[time=2029] I mean, God, I just think we had, I mean, he said he was sorry.
[time=2031] I don't think he says that.
[time=2032] You know what I think he says?
[time=2033] Satan comes in with this big list on me.
[time=2036] I think Christ says, you know what, Satan?
[time=2038] You're right.
[time=2039] He did all those things.
[time=2041] Now, Satan, because you're just a finite creature and you're not omniscient like I am and your demons aren't omniscient, you don't really know the full scoop on Russ.
[time=2050] Let me show you.
[time=2051] So then Christ lists out all the rest of my sins that Satan and his demons didn't find out about.
[time=2056] There's stuff in the secret recesses of my heart.
[time=2059] There's stuff that his demons didn't catch.
[time=2061] The case wasn't fully assembled because they aren't there all the time and they can't see the full extent of my sinful heart.
[time=2066] And so Christ just lays the whole thing out there in front of God and says, see, he's really guilty of more than what Satan said.
[time=2072] He's guilty of all of this stuff.
[time=2075] Absolutely guilty.
[time=2076] And Satan, you're right on a second count.
[time=2078] He doesn't deserve heaven.
[time=2079] He doesn't deserve eternal life.
[time=2081] He doesn't deserve to be forgiven.
[time=2083] And he hasn't lived up to all that I've given him at the point of salvation.
[time=2087] You're right.
[time=2089] There's just one problem in this whole case, Satan.
[time=2093] Look at it.
[time=2094] Verse 34.
[time=2096] Jesus Christ says, but I have died for the boy.
[time=2101] See my hands, Satan?
[time=2102] See my feet?
[time=2103] See my side?
[time=2104] Don't you remember?
[time=2105] You were there.
[time=2106] I was crucified for his sins.
[time=2109] All of them, past, present, and future.
[time=2112] The ones you know about and the ones you don't know about.
[time=2115] Not only was I killed and crucified in death.
[time=2119] 34, verse 34 goes on to say, and I was raised from the dead.
[time=2123] I was resurrected and that was God's seal of approval that my death was sufficient.
[time=2128] It was an acceptable sacrifice.
[time=2130] Not only did that occur, but then I went to the right hand of God.
[time=2133] Another text tells us he sat down at the right hand of God.
[time=2136] Christ sat down when that was done.
[time=2138] You recognize that in the Old Testament temple there were no seats because the priests were never done.
[time=2143] There was never a time when they could say we just sacrificed our last animal.
[time=2148] We've covered now forever the sins of the world.
[time=2150] They could never say that because their sacrifices did not have that kind of atoning power.
[time=2155] But Christ's atonement, when he died and was raised again, he then sat down which says it is finished.
[time=2161] It's over.
[time=2162] I've satisfied all the requirements of the law in my sacrifice for Russell.
[time=2168] Now beyond that, he goes on in verse 34 to just constantly remind God of the reality of those truths.
[time=2176] That's how he intercedes for me.
[time=2178] He doesn't say, he doesn't make excuses for me.
[time=2181] It was a tough moment.
[time=2182] He was in a weak time.
[time=2183] Let's give him a second chance.
[time=2185] He doesn't try to say yeah, but he's making progress.
[time=2187] Let's give the boy a little more time.
[time=2189] He just says, man, you don't know that half of this guy's sin.
[time=2193] I'll tell you about his sin.
[time=2196] But I'll also tell you about my redeeming work.
[time=2199] And my redeeming work is absolutely all encompassing.
[time=2205] Nothing he can do.
[time=2207] He has passed the point of no return.
[time=2211] He's under the blood.
[time=2214] And I wonder, why does Satan come back for that over and over and over and over again?
[time=2219] Apparently he does.
[time=2222] Hebrews 7.25, listen to this, this is wonderful.
[time=2225] Christ is able to save forever those who draw near to God
[time=2233] through him.
[time=2235] Christ is able to save forever those who draw near to God through him.
[time=2241] How come?
[time=2242] Since he always lives to make intercession for them.
[time=2247] He's alive, folks.
[time=2249] And his living proves the value of his sacrifice, and his living allows him to constantly intercede for us as we would be accused by the accuser.
[time=2260] So it's a four-fold protection you see there in that verse, verse 34.
[time=2264] Your protection, the security you know that you have in Christ that you will never, ever, ever lose your salvation is based on the fact that he died for you.
[time=2272] He was raised from the dead.
[time=2274] He has sat down as the symbol of his sacrifice being complete and being finished.
[time=2279] And then he goes on to intercede for you when charges come about your recurring sins.
[time=2286] Close case.
[time=2288] The Lord, by the way, has never lost a case.
[time=2293] There's a third reason here in this text that really excites me.
[time=2296] It comes down in verses 35 down through 37.
[time=2299] It's this.
[time=2300] You say to yourself, "Okay, okay, I'm catching on." I get the drift where eternally secure because, number one, God is for me, and God's not never going to be for me.
[time=2308] God is always going to be for me.
[time=2311] Okay.
[time=2312] I also understand that Christ is for me, and he is always going to be for me.
[time=2317] And as long as he's going to live, I'm going to be okay.
[time=2319] And he's going to live forever.
[time=2321] I got that.
[time=2322] But you're forgetting about this other problem, me.
[time=2328] I understand that we have a chain here of strength, the eternal security of my salvation, and God is a strong link, and Christ is a strong link.
[time=2336] But I'm not so sure about my link.
[time=2339] I'm not so sure about me, not finding that I would, at some day, just recant my Christian faith.
[time=2346] Oh, I'm okay now.
[time=2347] I mean, I feel pretty content in my salvation, and I love Jesus, but you know, circumstances could change.
[time=2352] I could come into some really hard times, and I could be so bitter by those hard times that I might just recant my faith and leave the church, or I might come under such heavy persecution that, though in my heart, I might think I love God when it was my life versus my Christian testimony.
[time=2369] Maybe I'll choose my life.
[time=2372] Maybe I will be able to stand up under the pressure.
[time=2375] So how can I really be secure in my faith if I know that I myself might recant on my faith?
[time=2383] That's the issue he's going to address now.
[time=2385] Look at it.
[time=2386] Verse 35.
[time=2388] "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" Shout tribulation.
[time=2395] Or distress.
[time=2397] Or persecution.
[time=2398] Or famine.
[time=2399] Or nakedness.
[time=2400] Or peril.
[time=2401] Or sword.
[time=2402] That's interesting, isn't it?
[time=2403] You expect them to list off a bunch of people that might do it.
[time=2406] But he doesn't list people.
[time=2407] He lists circumstances.
[time=2409] Which leads you to believe the person he has in mind is you.
[time=2414] Since you're the one who's going to be adversely impacted by those circumstances.
[time=2420] We've covered God.
[time=2421] We've covered Christ.
[time=2422] Now we're going to take care of you.
[time=2424] Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[time=2427] Shall tribulation.
[time=2428] Shall distress.
[time=2429] Persecution.
[time=2435] What he's doing is he's listing the worst possible circumstances that any human being could ever live in.
[time=2440] And the assumption is if a Christian can make it through the worst circumstances then they'll certainly stand through the lesser circumstances.
[time=2448] So he's taking us to the absolute apex of human suffering.
[time=2452] The absolute pinnacle of human persecution whereby a person would be tempted to back away from Christ and say I'd rather just not be persecuted.
[time=2460] Forget it.
[time=2461] I don't love Jesus anymore.
[time=2463] The word tribulation.
[time=2465] Let me just quickly review these terms for you so you have the insight as to what Paul is doing here.
[time=2469] Tribulation is talking about outward difficulties.
[time=2472] Pressures that squeeze you from the outside and leave you with absolutely no options.
[time=2477] There's no way out.
[time=2478] Distress describes the internal dynamic.
[time=2481] The internal suffering.
[time=2483] The feeling of strict confinement in the soul of helplessness.
[time=2487] This of course in the context of being persecuted for the cause of Christ.
[time=2491] Then persecution.
[time=2492] Which means includes physical and mental abuse suffered for the sake of Christ.
[time=2497] Now those words have new meaning in our day friends.
[time=2500] Physical and mental abuse.
[time=2502] And let your mind run to all the places that our society has redefined these terms.
[time=2508] The unbelievable levels of physical and mental abuse that are going on in our society.
[time=2513] That's how big this word is.
[time=2515] Famine.
[time=2516] Simply not enough food.
[time=2518] Nakedness doesn't necessarily mean nudity.
[time=2521] It means an inability to clothe yourself sufficiently to protect yourself against the environment.
[time=2527] Peril.
[time=2528] This is a word that describes treachery and plot.
[time=2532] People plotting against you even as they did against Daniel for example.
[time=2536] And then sword.
[time=2537] That is the universal symbol for death.
[time=2540] Look at these circumstances.
[time=2542] The worst possible circumstances imaginable are included in this list of possible scenarios.
[time=2552] As if to say who will separate us from the love of Christ.
[time=2556] Will you separate yourself from the love of Christ if tribulation distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, parallel or so?
[time=2563] Now his answer is twofold.
[time=2565] His answer is twofold and it comes in verses 36 and 37.
[time=2568] The first part of the answer is verse 36.
[time=2570] Look at this.
[time=2571] This is awesome.
[time=2572] Just as it is written, for thy sake we are being put to death all day long.
[time=2579] We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.
[time=2582] A quote from Psalm 44.
[time=2584] He's saying this.
[time=2585] Look friends.
[time=2587] When you come to Christ, when you give your life to Christ, you come to Christ out of such a deep conviction of your own personal sin and how completely worthy you are of nothing but damnation and hell and punishment.
[time=2604] That when you receive salvation and the forgiveness of your sins, your life is totally given over to God.
[time=2615] For thy sake, it says in verse 36, we are being put to death all day long.
[time=2620] My life is one long process of dying out of gratitude for the things which Christ has done on my behalf.
[time=2627] I am as it says to be a sheep for the slaughter.
[time=2630] Do you remember in the book of Matthew there is the parable trying to illustrate this concept of the merchant who spends his life traveling the seven seas looking for the great pearls of the world?
[time=2643] And he finally happens upon one pearl, the pearl of great price as it is called, and it says he gives up everything for the one pearl.
[time=2654] When a person truly comes to Christ, that is the fundamental transaction that is occurring in that person's life.
[time=2661] I am so worthy of hell and so worthy of damnation.
[time=2665] My life is such a miserable, failing reality that for the forgiveness that I can find in this great pearl I will give you everything I have, including my life.
[time=2676] So what is the big deal, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, I already counted that cost at salvation.
[time=2685] That was a part of the deal.
[time=2689] Being put to death physically, being considered a sheet to be slaughtered, that is par for the course.
[time=2696] That is what it means when I say I give my life to Christ.
[time=2700] Nobody redefined the terms, nobody suddenly switched on me that made me reconsider my decision.
[time=2706] Nobody kind of said, well, the first part of your Christianity then Jesus will do everything you need for you and make your life happy and make your life complete and have a wonderful plan for your life and all this stuff.
[time=2715] And then suddenly, as if everything changed, you mean now I got to suffer?
[time=2720] You mean now God doesn't live for me?
[time=2723] No, that is not true conversion.
[time=2725] True conversion from the start is an absolute abdication of all your rights and all your privileges for Christ.
[time=2733] Among those are the physical realities of my life.
[time=2736] What are you saying?
[time=2737] That's nothing new.
[time=2739] Now, even like verse 37 more, the second part of his answer.
[time=2742] Watch what he says here.
[time=2744] But in all these things, what things?
[time=2746] The stuff he just mentioned, tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sore.
[time=2749] In all these things, we overwhelmingly conquer.
[time=2756] Through him who loved us.
[time=2758] It's a compound Greek word.
[time=2760] Hooper Nickleman.
[time=2762] Hooper is the prefix and it means super abounding.
[time=2765] It means overwhelmingly is how they translated it there.
[time=2768] The other word, Nike, means to conquer.
[time=2771] It is in fact the name of the Greek goddess of victory.
[time=2775] When we go through situations like this, we excel.
[time=2781] I mean, that's when we really become who we are.
[time=2784] It's when we are in persecution and tribulation and famine and nakedness and peril and our life is threatened that people finally see what we are really made of.
[time=2793] That's when we super exceed and we super excel.
[time=2798] See, we are different by virtue of our salvation.
[time=2801] When we come to Christ, things change inside of us.
[time=2804] And so when these difficult situations come, we finally get to see just how changed we are.
[time=2810] It's hard to assess how strong we are as believers in this kind of culture where there is very little persecution.
[time=2817] But you lift us out of this culture and put us in times of difficult stress and trial and hardship and you'll find that we are rising to meet the level of the competition.
[time=2828] You will find that our commitment in Christ will exescalate and whatever it takes for us not to have to deny our faith in Christ will do it.
[time=2837] That's what he's saying.
[time=2839] Sometimes like these that we really find out what we're made out of.
[time=2844] If you really want to know what I am made of, put me to the test I excel is what he's saying.
[time=2849] By virtue of who Christ has made us.
[time=2852] We don't know how strong we are because we don't have this level of distress in our lives to test it.
[time=2858] I was thinking about this, didn't know how to illustrate it, but I'll give you a shot here with my dog.
[time=2862] I wish you could see my dog swim.
[time=2864] He's a Labrador retriever.
[time=2865] You come in my house, you see my dog laying on the floor there and you think I had dog, average mediocre dog, dog.
[time=2871] Okay.
[time=2872] You come with me on a cold winter's day.
[time=2875] I mean cold, real cold, Indiana cold.
[time=2878] There's ice around the edge of the lake.
[time=2880] We're stuck in a duck blind.
[time=2883] We're waiting for some ducks to come.
[time=2886] They finally come.
[time=2887] We shoot one out of the air.
[time=2888] The duck falls 100 yards away over into this lake.
[time=2894] Now you're going to find out what my dog is made out.
[time=2897] Without hesitation and instinctively, because this is what he was bred to do, he leaps into this icy cold water.
[time=2904] Doesn't phase him.
[time=2905] He doesn't get back out and shiver.
[time=2907] It's cold.
[time=2909] You see, he's got this layer of fat and then this remarkable coat.
[time=2913] He goes in there and says, "Oh, this is good.
[time=2916] This feels refreshing." It was hot in that stupid duck blind with those guys.
[time=2920] All those coats on drinking coffee.
[time=2922] What was that?
[time=2923] He's in his element now.
[time=2924] He's got a long way to swim.
[time=2926] He starts making his strokes.
[time=2928] You can't see it, but I've seen it in my pool.
[time=2930] He's got web feet.
[time=2932] His toes open up and he starts stroking his way across the water.
[time=2936] He's got an extra air bag somewhere in his back hind quarters so he doesn't sink.
[time=2940] He's just very buoyant.
[time=2942] He's just motors like this machine right across this icy cold water.
[time=2946] He gets to the duck.
[time=2947] He doesn't maul the duck.
[time=2949] He's got these big floppy jowls that just gently grab a hold of the duck.
[time=2954] A live or dead.
[time=2955] It doesn't matter.
[time=2956] He can hold the duck securely without damaging the duck.
[time=2960] Remarkable design.
[time=2961] You'd think there was a creator.
[time=2962] He turns around.
[time=2963] He swims all the way back to me.
[time=2965] He doesn't swim to somebody else.
[time=2967] He doesn't eat the duck.
[time=2968] He doesn't disappear.
[time=2969] He instinctively draws this thing back into my hand and then sits there and says, "When do I get to do this again?
[time=2976] I'll do this all day.
[time=2977] I have remarkable stamina." You see, all the dimensions of what he has really made the bee to see it, you've got to put him in what we consider really difficult circumstances.
[time=2989] You can't tell what he is when he lays on the floor.
[time=2992] Same thing with Christian.
[time=2993] You can't tell what we are when we're in this kind of neutral culture.
[time=3000] But you put us in adverse circumstances.
[time=3003] You put us under tribulation and persecution and peril and nakedness and sword.
[time=3008] And you'll find out what you're really made of, Christian.
[time=3011] That's what he's saying to you.
[time=3012] You will overwhelmingly conquer.
[time=3015] You will not back up.
[time=3016] You will not recant your faith.
[time=3018] You will not go into cognito.
[time=3020] You will stand.
[time=3021] You will take your persecution.
[time=3023] And if need be, you will die.
[time=3025] And see that in your death, you just conquered again.
[time=3028] Because now you're off this stinking planet and you're in the presence of Christ.
[time=3032] You're in your redeemed body.
[time=3033] Everything you've been hoping for just came true.
[time=3035] They can't hurt you.
[time=3037] Why would that cause us to recant?
[time=3042] Powerful.
[time=3043] It's true.
[time=3045] So he says, "Ah, if you're not convinced, I've got one more thing to say to you." God is not going to turn his back on you.
[time=3051] You can count on that.
[time=3052] He already made the big deposit.
[time=3053] He's going to pay whatever else needs to be paid to get you safe home.
[time=3056] Christ is not going to turn his back on you.
[time=3059] He lives to enter seed on your behalf.
[time=3062] You, my friend, you are not going to turn your back on him because you're made differently now that you're in Christ.
[time=3069] You may not even sense it in you yet, but when these things come, you will see it rising up inside of you, the strength of God will empower you to overwhelmingly conquer in those situations.
[time=3079] Now that's not enough.
[time=3080] Look at verses 38 and 39.
[time=3082] For I am convinced that neither death nor life, that's kind of the both bookends of the thing,
[time=3088] nor angels, meaning holy angels, nor principalities, meaning demon angels, Ephesians 6, the powers
[time=3095] and the principalities of this age, nor things present or things to come.
[time=3099] Nothing in your life right now.
[time=3101] Nothing in the life of Christ.
[time=3102] Nothing in the life of God.
[time=3104] Nothing in the life of anybody you know or could know about.
[time=3107] Nothing now or nothing in the future will ever change.
[time=3110] Things present or things to come.
[time=3112] Nor powers.
[time=3113] Now watch nor height or depth, the word height is a phrase used of space, the farthest points
[time=3120] out at the highest points of space, nor the deepest, deepest points.
[time=3124] Now watch nor any other created thing.
[time=3126] And if you didn't get the "you" aren't going to desert him up in verse 35, then get it here because you're certainly created in any other created thing.
[time=3133] You're in that group.
[time=3134] So neither height nor depth nor any other created thing, including you, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[time=3144] It's over.
[time=3145] You're safe.
[time=3146] You have passed the point of no return.
[time=3151] Say, "Wait a minute.
[time=3154] What about people who say they're Christians and we can't?"
[time=3160] I mean we could go in our history books and we could find people who for years and years and years and years were in the church and were professing Christ and then the crisis came and they deserted Christ and they backed up on their faith and they walked out on Christianity.
[time=3171] What about those people?
[time=3174] Let me read you a verse, 1 John.
[time=3177] You don't need to turn there.
[time=3179] They went out from us, meaning in the context, supports this, meaning that they left Christianity
[time=3187] or recanted on their faith.
[time=3188] They went out from us but they were not really of us.
[time=3193] For if they had been of us, they would have remained with us.
[time=3197] Just what Paul said.
[time=3199] But they went out in order that it might be shown that they all are not of us.
[time=3205] What's he saying there?
[time=3206] He's saying there is this big group of people, everybody says they're Christians.
[time=3210] If when the trial comes and if what the temptation comes, certain people recant and desert, it doesn't mean that those people were once saved and lost their salvation.
[time=3220] That is not the conclusion you draw.
[time=3222] He says you draw the other conclusion, they were never truly saved.
[time=3227] They were just never saved.
[time=3230] They went out from us but they weren't really of us.
[time=3235] For if they had been of us, they would have remained.
[time=3237] That's a spiritual principle.
[time=3239] You can go to the bank on that thing.
[time=3241] True believers don't recant their faith.
[time=3245] So if somebody who says they're a believer recants their faith, what you've got is a mere profession, an empty profession of faith that is not genuine and they're not truly saved.
[time=3254] It's not that they're at that moment losing their salvation.
[time=3258] They went out in order that it might be shown that they all are not of us.
[time=3266] That's great assurance, isn't it?
[time=3268] Guy's not going to take it away.
[time=3270] Christ isn't going to take it away.
[time=3271] You can't take it away and no other created thing can take it away.
[time=3277] Remember that wonderful hymn, how firm a foundation.
[time=3281] Let me read you the last two phrases of it as we close.
[time=3284] The last two choruses or verses of it, listen to this.
[time=3287] Fear not.
[time=3289] I am with thee, O be not dismayed, for I am thy God and still give thee aid.
[time=3296] I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand up held by my righteous omnipotent hand.
[time=3303] Now the third verse, "When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie, my grace all sufficient
[time=3310] shall be thy supply.
[time=3312] The flame shall not hurt thee, I only design thy drawst to consume and thy gold to refine.
[time=3320] The soul that on Jesus hath lean for repose, I will not, I will not desert to its foes.
[time=3331] That soul, though all hell, should endeavor to shake.
[time=3336] I'll never, no, never, never." Or say, that's it.
[time=3347] Well expresses the commitment of our great God to us in salvage was pretty good.

[time=3423] A message was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3427] If as a result of today's program you've made a decision to trust Christ, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3435] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I'm a sinner, and I want to ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3445] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3448] If you prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3453] If you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance.
[time=3457] It'll help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
