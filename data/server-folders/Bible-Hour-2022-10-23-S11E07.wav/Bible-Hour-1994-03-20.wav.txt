[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] - Ecclesiastes is a book that I never touched in teaching
[time=39] 19 years at Grace College in Seminary.
[time=42] I never touched, just never had time.
[time=44] There isn't enough.
[time=45] But since I've been pastoring, it's been my privilege to study this book and I'm impressed at the profundity of it as I look at passages like chapter three verse one.
[time=56] There isn't a point in time for everything and there is a time for every event under heaven.
[time=62] (dramatic music)
[time=69] - Welcome to The Bible Hour,
[time=77] an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=82] Thank you for joining us.
[time=84] For the most part, time, as taught in the scriptures, neither abstract nor durational.
[time=90] Rather, it's understood as a moment or an event when God acted.
[time=94] Thus, our response to such events is critical.
[time=98] In the New Testament, we are taught to redeem, that is to buy out or purchase completely the time.
[time=104] In an era of apathy and celebration of self, are we missing the unique blessings that come from redeeming the time?
[time=112] While Pastor Mor is absent, we ask you to stay with us today as our special guest speaker, Dr. Donald Fowler, addresses the subject of time.
[time=120] Dr. Fowler was a professor of Hebrew and Greek for 20 years at Grace College and Seminary and has been a pastor for many of those years.
[time=128] We know you'll enjoy this special message.
[time=130] Our special music today will be provided by Scott Schindler and Brian Losen.
[time=137] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=142] ("Pomp and Circumstance") [MUSIC - 201 seconds]
[time=354] - The Bible Hour has something just for you.
[time=365] All through the month of March, we're offering this lovely marker free to all viewers who write and request one.
[time=371] We hope you'll put it to good use in your Bible and also let it be a reminder to pray for the Bible Hour Ministry.
[time=377] To receive your free marker, just write us here at the Bible Hour.
[time=381] Our address is the Bible Hour 7400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=388] Drop us a note today.
[time=390] Now let's return to our service.
[time=397] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 105 seconds]
[time=514] (gentle piano music) [MUSIC - 141 seconds]
[time=661] - I hope you've been inspired by the music so far in the Bible hour.
[time=664] I know that you enjoy our sanctuary choir in orchestra and Brian Losa did a beautiful job on his solo and we look forward to some music from our organist, Scott Schindler, in just a few minutes.
[time=675] I wanna remind you and thank you for the letters that you've written to us, especially those of you that had prayer requests.
[time=681] We really counted a privilege to get together as a staff of the Bible hour each week on Wednesday mornings and pray specifically for the requests that you have and I wanna encourage you to write us and tell us about your problems and your needs and your prayer requests so that we as a staff can share that in need with the Lord and it's a real privilege for us to do that.
[time=703] Then I wanna share some activities that are coming up in the next week or so on Good Friday, April 1st.
[time=708] We'll have a candlelight communion service here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church in our worship center.
[time=714] It'll be a beautiful service commemorating the death of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, remembering him and the agony that he endured as he went to the cross.
[time=723] So it's a short service just from 1215 to 1245 on Friday, April 1st, right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church in our worship center.
[time=732] Come and join with us.
[time=733] It'll be a wonderful just half hour of commemorating the death of Jesus.
[time=740] And then if you're not a regular, a tenderate church but go on Easter, we'd love to have you come to Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=745] We're gonna have two identical services on Sunday morning, April 3rd.
[time=750] The first one will begin at 915 and the second one will be at 1050.
[time=755] I'll guarantee that you'll hear some great resurrection music.
[time=758] Some of the finest music ever written was written about the resurrection of Jesus Christ and certainly the theme for all Christians and what a glorious day that is.
[time=767] And then you'll hear a message from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore.
[time=772] It'll be an exciting day for you.
[time=774] Looking down the line a little farther, we will be advertising shortly a concert by Ray Bolz.
[time=780] That'll be on Thursday evening May 19th.
[time=783] That's a little ways away but I just want you to be sure and mark that on your calendar.
[time=788] You can get tickets beginning the 1st of April at any of the Christian bookstores in town or even by stopping here at the church and we'll have them available for you.
[time=798] So that'll be a great concert on May 19th on Thursday evening.
[time=804] While we're gonna go back to some more music, as I mentioned and then we have a guest speaker, Dr. Donald Fowler, I'm sure you'll enjoy him.
[time=810] So I hope you'll stay tuned for the rest of the Bible hour today.

[time=1113] (applause)
[time=1121] - Thank you very much Scott.
[time=1124] We meet you the third and fourth verse of that song, and can it be that Scott just played long, my imprisoned spirit lay, fast bound in sin and nature's night.
[time=1134] Thy night effused a quickening ray.
[time=1137] I woke the dungeon flamed with light.
[time=1140] My chains fell off, my heart was free.
[time=1143] I rose, went forth, and followed thee.
[time=1146] No condemnation, now I dread Jesus, and all in him is mine.
[time=1151] Alive in him, my living head, and clothed in righteousness divine.
[time=1156] Bold, I approach the eternal throne and claim the crown through Christ my own.
[time=1163] What a privilege it is to sing great songs of the death and the glorious resurrection, particularly at this time, and we know that we have a living God.
[time=1172] I'm delighted today to have a guest speaker.
[time=1174] Dr. Donald Fowler is from Grace College in Seminary, formerly taught there for a number of years, and every time we hear of someone from that great school, we're excited about their ministry here at Blackhawk.
[time=1186] He presently is the pastor of the Harrison Center Church near Warsaw, and is doing a number of studies and ministries abroad that you'll hear about in his message, and I had the good opportunity to hear him in the first service and look forward to hearing him again.
[time=1202] I'm very glad that we have the opportunity to have Dr. Fowler with us this morning.
[time=1206] Let's listen to him as he preaches from God's Word today.
[time=1209] It's good to be here, thank you.
[time=1220] When I'm here and following the likes of Russ Moore, then I would like to quote that Bible verse about looking not on the outward man.
[time=1237] I must say, my heart has been overwhelmed with the blessings of the music.
[time=1245] It's just thrilling.
[time=1247] I hate to see that part stop.
[time=1249] I wish we could just keep doing that.
[time=1251] Some of you are wondering how or why I'm here.
[time=1255] Pastor Russ has gone, and he called me up money and asked me if I could come over.
[time=1260] I guess a couple of weeks ago when I was speaking at Taylor University at their spiritual emphasis week in Fort Wayne, a number of the students had spoken to him about one of my messages and how they wanted that message to be preached here.
[time=1274] We talked about it and agreed that I'd think about it, but I would really like to just see what God would lay on my heart.
[time=1283] I've known your pastor for some time now.
[time=1285] My best friend was Chuck Smith, and he left Grace to go out and help found the master's seminary.
[time=1295] Of course, Russ and Bob Provost were on the staff out there, and so Chuck was my best friend, and through him I got to know Russ because he had Russ and a number of the other faculty members come back to Grace and take a class.
[time=1308] During that time, Pastor Russ stayed at my house and we developed a friendship that way.
[time=1314] And then, of course, I was in California with some regularity and taught a class out there, for example, and things like that at masters.
[time=1322] But for some of you who know Bob Provost, well, you'll get a tickle out of this story because I'm now pastoring the church where Bob Provost was the first pastor of, and Bob was my student.
[time=1339] I know all of you are sitting there thinking you look too young to have been a professor of Bob, and that's good that you're thinking that.
[time=1350] He came to school a little older than most of our other students.
[time=1355] I'd like to tell you a little bit later how Bob fits into this message that I'd like to share with you.
[time=1361] When I go to a place to preach, I like to preach two things.
[time=1365] I like to preach from the Old Testament because I finally don't give very much preaching from it, and two, I like to preach expositionally.
[time=1373] So what I'm going to do is do a little bit of preaching expositionally from the Old Testament, and then we're going to share with you what is the burden of my heart.
[time=1382] But I'd like to ask you to turn with me to a book that I'm sure you all know well.
[time=1386] It's the book of Ecclesiastes.
[time=1388] Actually, I don't know of too many books in the Old Testament
[time=1394] that are harder to understand than the book of Ecclesiastes.
[time=1399] And this much I'm sure about in Ecclesiastes, if what you do is get in there and read six or eight verses, you're going to be confused.
[time=1407] This is the book that to be understood, you have to go from one end of the book to the other, and you have to learn how to put it all together.
[time=1414] Now, I've done that, so I'm going to have to ask you to trust me that when I draw these conclusions, these are conclusions that I think are valid conclusions.
[time=1422] But I would like to ask you to turn to what I think is one of the most profound aspects of the book, and that is chapter three, when for two chapters, the preacher has given to us a worldview
[time=1436] that he has pursued that hasn't worked for him.
[time=1440] And at the end of chapter two, he surfaces a worldview that begins to work for him, and that's a worldview that is working because he has to conclude that when I live in a world that doesn't make sense, there is no alternative to the truth that God is in absolute control.
[time=1458] So with that in mind, he says to us in chapter three, verse one, there is an appointed time for everything and a time for every event under earth.
[time=1467] And then he gives us one of the most beautiful, if not the most beautiful poem, in the entire Old Testament, which I would love to show you how it works, but I don't have time. And then concerning that word time, he picks it up again in verse 11 when he says he has made everything appropriate in its time.
[time=1486] He has made everything appropriate. The word should have been translated.
[time=1489] He has made everything beautiful in its time.
[time=1494] And if you go back to the poem, he's talking about some things that don't seem beautiful.
[time=1498] There is a time to give birth, and there is a time to die.
[time=1503] But as he has come to understand how God works, he has been able to accept something that only the most spiritually mature can accept.
[time=1513] And that is that when God works, it's always beautiful.
[time=1518] There is a time to give birth and a time to die, and all God's times are beautiful.
[time=1524] Now, one of the things I would like to hurry with this morning is to ask you to think about.
[time=1529] When we think of the word time, it's not the same way that they think of the word time.
[time=1534] I thought about the word time if you caught my glance when I look in panic up there to see how many seconds and minutes I have left to go.
[time=1541] They did not think of time in terms of numbers, but in terms of activities.
[time=1550] Time for them was something that God did.
[time=1556] He interceded, and therefore, time is a time when God acted.
[time=1563] And so when he says, in God's time, everything is beautiful.
[time=1567] What he means is God's acts are always beautiful.
[time=1573] The Apostle Paul takes the exact word I went to the Greek version of the Old Testament, and I checked it out to make sure he used the same word.
[time=1581] And it's the same word that Paul uses in his epistles.
[time=1584] The Apostle Paul used a fairly rare word in his epistles, and only used it four times.
[time=1589] And you know them very well because two of them appear in the book of Galatians in which the Apostle Paul said,
[time=1596] "We are redeemed from the law." That word redeemed means purchased completely, bought out from the law into freedom.
[time=1611] We've been set free into freedom. We have been purchased.
[time=1616] Now Paul uses that same word, and it doesn't come across at all in his other two epistles.
[time=1621] And Colossians 4, 7, I believe, and Ephesians 5, 16, where Paul says, and the older versions translated it, "redeemed the time."
[time=1630] Now with new versions, who knows, there are so many versions going around, so many of my age can't keep track of them.
[time=1637] Redeemed the time means purchase back the time, purchase it completely, don't let time or opportunity miss you.
[time=1650] Time is when God is acting, but none of us really know when that is because here's the truth.
[time=1658] Christ said in the book of Acts, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons."
[time=1666] But He has given to all of us time, and it is something that we are supposed to be responsible for.
[time=1673] And so Paul takes the writer of Ecclesiastes, who can make the declarative statement that God has made everything beautiful in its time,
[time=1684] and then offered to us time and said, "Do something with it."
[time=1691] Now one of the things I've learned after teaching almost 20 years in seminary is that theology is a whole lot easier than applying it.
[time=1701] That's why it's so hard for people who have been teaching in seminary to become pastors, because we can just deal with the facts, ma'am, if you remember the great line from Dragnet, just the facts, ma'am.
[time=1712] Well we're real good at that in an educational institution, but when you start trying to make that work in our lives, then it gets to be a little more difficult.
[time=1720] That leads me to where I'd like to tell you about my friend Bob Provost, because God had a time for me, and I had no idea what it was and when it was coming.
[time=1729] But it was in the midst of the most chaotic year of my life.
[time=1732] It was my last year teaching at Grace Seminary, and in that year I taught the equivalent of two and one-half years of class credits in the space of 11 months.
[time=1743] I don't know how I did that, including one brand new course, which I didn't need to add to all of that.
[time=1749] On top of all of that, I finished as the book review editor the last issue of the Grace Theological Journal.
[time=1757] On top of that, I had three sermon preps because I had already accepted a church, so I was doing three sermon preps on top of teaching a huge overload of classes.
[time=1769] On top of that, it was my daughter's senior year, and so we were traveling all over the Midwest and the eastern part of the country looking at colleges.
[time=1778] On top of that, I had a wife who waved at me as I passed by.
[time=1786] It was a very, very difficult year, and as a matter of fact, it might even have been this month that I was standing out on the hall talking with one of my colleagues, or listening in the case of some of my other colleagues, depending on who it was.
[time=1801] And the phone rang, and my secretary, after three rings, it goes to the secretary's office, and she came out to get me, and I have since come to refer to this as the call in the hall.
[time=1814] Because when I went to the phone, and it was this -- hi, my name is Michael Johnson, and I'm a missionary for Eastern Europe with Send International.
[time=1826] I don't know Michael Johnson from Peter Pan. I mean, how did you get me?
[time=1831] This is like one of those phone calls at dinner time at 5.30. You know how those dinner calls go?
[time=1835] We want to sell you aluminum siding. I got a brick house. I'm thinking, what does this man want?
[time=1842] And so he said, "Your name has been given to me. We need a teacher to come and teach introduction to the Pentateuch."
[time=1849] That is the first five books of the Bible. We need a teacher to come and teach to us because, A, we don't have anybody in your name has been highly recommended, and I thought, who would do that to me?
[time=1858] [laughter] Well, it was Bob Provost.
[time=1864] And Bob had recommended my name, and they checked up on me and found out, you know, that whatever they found out.
[time=1871] And so they invited me to come. Now, let me just explain to you.
[time=1876] I'm above 39 years old. I don't like to travel.
[time=1885] If you knew the history of what happens to me on airplanes, not one of you in this building would fly with me.
[time=1893] And so I'm about as excited about this trip as I am about having fertilizer for breakfast.
[time=1900] But I'm not about to tell my board -- I'm not about to tell -- no, that would be un-Christian.
[time=1905] So I took it back to my board, and I thought, there's no problem here because I know what my board's going to say to me.
[time=1911] They're going to say, "Pastor, this is your first year, and you've been teaching like a maniac, and it's really not a good time.
[time=1916] You only have two months between the end of school year and the trip to Bulgaria." And it would be, you know, all those good, normal, sensible things that I expected from them.
[time=1925] I didn't know my board.
[time=1927] My board said to me, "Oh, Pastor, what a wonderful opportunity. We can do that." Hey, this is a $1,500 expense for which there is no remuneration, and we're just a little church with a budget of $50,000.
[time=1940] No problem, Pastor. We'll take up a love offering.
[time=1946] We took up a love offering, $1,500 comes in, and I'm on my way to Bulgaria.
[time=1953] Do you know where Bulgaria is? I didn't.
[time=1956] [laughter] Happily, it's the country to the east of the former Yugoslavia.
[time=1963] I have no idea where I'm going to be truthful, even as I go.
[time=1967] I don't know anything about this school.
[time=1969] I find out when I get there that I'm not teaching introduction to Pentateuch, that I'm really teaching Genesis.
[time=1977] So I get to the place, and I never forget because I walked to the class the first day, and we meet in this room,
[time=1986] and this is in the middle of November, but in the middle of November in Bulgaria is more like the middle of January.
[time=1992] You know, 12, 15 degrees. I didn't even bring along a coat.
[time=1996] The room isn't heated. It's not a problem.
[time=1999] Bulgarians are used to that. What I want to tell you about is what happened when I was in Bulgaria,
[time=2006] because God has lit a fire under my heart that I'm not going to be content unless I at least get the opportunity
[time=2012] to tell everybody who listened to me that God is bigger than these United States.
[time=2018] When I walked into the classroom, I went into a place that I had no idea what it really was.
[time=2026] Back in 1978, there were no schools training pastors, and so a group of pastors gathered together surreptitiously
[time=2035] and tried to teach themselves the Bible because they didn't know the Bible.
[time=2039] That was in the midst of the Communist regime.
[time=2042] Well, as you know, in 1989, the Communist regime collapsed,
[time=2049] and that created an opportunity for the founding of the Bulgarian Biblical Academy, which is one of only a half a dozen schools in all of Eastern Europe, which is training pastors for pastoral ministry.
[time=2064] To tell you how effective they've been, in two years' time, they have nearly 400 students
[time=2072] because their teaching staff goes to where the Bulgarian pastors are at.
[time=2079] They have over 400 students, and now they've started a school in the capital of Bulgaria, Sofia.
[time=2085] They're well on their way to purchasing their first building, which, by the way, is important for the school actually surviving.
[time=2095] Let me tell you how successful they've been. Since 1992, the students who belong to the Bulgarian Biblical Academy
[time=2106] have found it, if you can imagine this, over 100 new churches in Bulgaria alone.
[time=2113] Where are you going to find a success rate like that across the globe?
[time=2117] I didn't know any of this. I walk in a classroom, I see 24 students, I'm freezing.
[time=2124] Well, they turned out to be every teacher's dream because they are intensely in love with the Word of God.
[time=2134] And what I found is that they literally hung on every word.
[time=2138] To give you an illustration that kind of runs counter to the way students that I've been teaching sometimes react,
[time=2145] when it became clear that we weren't going to be able to get through the book of Genesis,
[time=2151] it's hard to work through a translator.
[time=2154] You lose about a 30 of your time working through a translator, and I don't know a Bulgarian.
[time=2158] I did find one word, not premier, for example.
[time=2162] But that didn't help a lot in the translation exercise.
[time=2166] So what they asked, they said, "Look, we want to come an extra day and give you an extra four hours
[time=2174] that we can finish Genesis." Can you imagine that in America?
[time=2181] Not unless it's on a beach somewhere.
[time=2186] What I found was intense students who are serious about doing Christian ministry, and for me as a teacher of the Word of God, I couldn't have asked for more.
[time=2196] Finally, what I also found was a persecuted church.
[time=2205] Right now, the Bulgarian government has estimated that there are something like 150 American
[time=2214] or Western sects working in the country of Bulgaria.
[time=2220] It's estimated that there have been over 200 suicides from Bulgarian people who have fallen
[time=2227] into the influence of some of the most bizarre elements you can think of that make up the religious experience in America.
[time=2236] As a result of that, the Bulgarian government, working with the Orthodox Church,
[time=2242] has gone hand in hand in doing its best to see to it that they can put a stop
[time=2248] to the work of the church, to the work of the non-Orthodox Church in Bulgaria.
[time=2254] And of course, there's one sense in which I can look at it and say, "I really can't blame you.
[time=2258] I can't share with you because I don't have time just how many crazy things I have heard that have gone on over there in the name of Christianity with some of these groups.
[time=2267] But I can only tell you that the persecution is severe.
[time=2272] When you're outside of major cities like Sofia, usually the church and the local government
[time=2279] is able to work hand in hand and see to it that the church not only can't have its own building,
[time=2286] it can't even rent a building." Well, you know what I've found about Christians when you start pushing them around?
[time=2295] A few of them are going to quit, and then most of them are going to get serious about being Christians.
[time=2300] So what that element of the church has started doing now is they've started meeting in houses.
[time=2306] And all across Bulgaria, churches are meeting in houses because there's nothing to lock and do about it.
[time=2312] Now, the bad news is nobody in Bulgaria has houses like you and I think.
[time=2317] A house is really, if you're wealthy, is a two-bedroom apartment.
[time=2322] And so try to cram 25 or 30 people into a small living room, and you've got an experience of what it's like to worship in a church in Bulgaria.
[time=2331] But I'll tell you what, that's the way the church started out.
[time=2336] The church won its place in the world without a building.
[time=2342] It was not until 250, 80, two and a half centuries after Christ that the church built its first building.
[time=2352] So I have no qualms in my heart about what's going to happen to the church in Bulgaria.
[time=2357] I believe firmly that God is going to prosper and it's going to grow.
[time=2363] I also am afraid for the missionary presence in the West because they are putting severe crackdowns on missionaries trying to do the work.
[time=2373] When you come into the country with a visa, as an American, they stamp right on your visa why you're there.
[time=2381] And mine was to teach in a religious school, but I only was going to be there one month so I didn't have any problem.
[time=2388] Well, what they've gone now is from granting visas that were one to two-year visas.
[time=2393] Now they've gone to granting visas where every month, if you are a religious missionary in the country,
[time=2400] every month you have to leave the country and go to some other country and get your visa stamped.
[time=2407] And it's nothing more than the technique to discourage missionaries and to get them out of the country completely.
[time=2413] And it's an item of prayer for those of you who pray for missions in general.
[time=2417] The bad news is for the missionaries in Sofia that the closest country to get their visas renewed is Yugoslavia, or the former Yugoslavia.
[time=2426] Dangerous trip, but nonetheless I'm looking at a church which is being persecuted and that's not going to change.
[time=2434] And indeed it could be within the next year or two that missionary involvement in the country of Bulgaria is going to come to an end.
[time=2441] There's a third thing that I saw that was impressive as I thought about the experience, and that was to rejoice in how successful the church was.
[time=2455] I was invited to speak to a little house church in Plovdiv, Sofia.
[time=2461] One of the things that's amazing about their language is they don't accent their words on the right syllable.
[time=2468] Everything in American is usually the first syllable and you over there it's always the last syllable.
[time=2474] And so even if you know the word you say it wrong and it's very, very embarrassing.
[time=2479] So I was invited to speak this little Baptist church in Plovdiv.
[time=2483] And when I get there I'm just awestruck at how ethnic it was.
[time=2490] Here is a first semester, first year student at the Bulgarian Biblical Academy who along with his wife have been working in this city of, I don't know, it looked like to me around 20,000 people.
[time=2504] And in the space of less than a year they have been able to win from what I could see in the room it looked like 25 to 30 new converts to Christianity.
[time=2516] And that's happening all across the country and this guy doesn't know anything about the Bible.
[time=2522] What would happen if this man was actually theologically educated?
[time=2529] See, the church is growing and I'm convinced that God has got his unique hand upon it.
[time=2539] Well, when I came back from Bulgaria I was really pumped and enthused because it was just so exciting to see what's happening.
[time=2554] When I came back, however, because I'm a pastor I'm anxious about the well-being of my church.
[time=2560] I don't like being gone three weeks at a time and I don't like being gone from my family as well.
[time=2567] It's lonely for me and my wife can't cook and so it's a real difficult situation when I'm gone.
[time=2573] I do all the cooking and you know you can only do so much spaghetti in three weeks time.
[time=2578] So I don't like being gone and so when I came back I assured my church that I said I want you to understand it.
[time=2584] Now I'm not going back for at least another year or two because I don't feel it's fair to the church.
[time=2589] See, I didn't really understand this board.
[time=2592] The academy sent a letter to our little church and in the letter they said it was a three paragraph letter and in the letter they spent that much time telling the church how much they thank the church for it.
[time=2607] They thank the church for sending me over.
[time=2609] They understood what a terrible financial sacrifice it was for a little church to do that.
[time=2613] And in the second paragraph they then said we want you to know just how effective your pastor was in working with these Bulgarian students because we really had a love affair.
[time=2622] I think primarily because we love the word of God.
[time=2625] In the third paragraph they said can you send him back right away?
[time=2631] Now there was a legitimacy to their request because what they needed was somebody to teach Hebrew grammar.
[time=2638] A lot of people can teach Hebrew Bible, not a lot of people teach Hebrew grammar.
[time=2642] My board said to me, "Pastor, we'd like to talk."
[time=2651] Now I've been married long enough to know that that usually means that this is something that I'd rather not talk about.
[time=2660] And so I said, "Alright, let me know what's going through your mind." And one of my board members looked at me and he said, "Pastor, we've been wondering if you ought to reconsider this opportunity to go back and teach Hebrew grammar."
[time=2677] I didn't say anything.
[time=2680] And then another one said, "Pastor, what are you thinking?" And I said, "Well, I said to be truthful with you, I'm anxious and concerned about my absence from the church for another three weeks when I was just gone three weeks to go back in November.
[time=2698] I'll be leaving April 10th."
[time=2706] One of my favorite deacons made me my favorite, he looked over at me, he's from Arkansas, he doesn't really speak English.
[time=2718] But he's a lot smarter than he likes to let on.
[time=2720] And he looked over at me and he made a joke and he said, "Now, pastor, he said, "If we can't get along without you for three weeks, we're in big trouble."
[time=2730] I didn't exactly know how to take that.
[time=2736] Well, we talked about it and I thought, "You're right, man. I've been insensitive to the Spirit of God because I didn't want to go back. I want to stay home. I want to be with my family. I want to be with my church. I want to do the ministry here."
[time=2747] You hear all those eyes?
[time=2751] So I decided to agree with them. So we began to, how are we going to do this? We're a little church.
[time=2757] We had a $53,000 budget, $12,000 of our money last year already was given a mission, almost one out of every $5 is already going into missions. We don't have any money like that left in the church.
[time=2769] So we sat and we asked one another how to go about prioritizing this and so it was very interesting.
[time=2776] They said, "What we'll all do is contact a church or two that we know that would like to contribute to this kind of a ministry because it's so exciting to see what God is doing."
[time=2785] So I wrote to a couple of churches that I felt close to and then we set a date for the offering. We needed another $1,500.
[time=2799] Before I even got to the, as a matter of fact, we haven't even got to the date where the offering is being taken, we already had $1,500 in a little church of 100 people financing my return to Bulgaria.
[time=2815] We had a second church that, the first church that I contacted, the pastor called me up and said, "I've got good news. We're going to take up an offering."
[time=2822] I said, "I really appreciate that." He said, "I'm hoping we can get two to $300." I said, "That would be wonderful. That's all we need."
[time=2831] He called me back a week later and he said, "I think these people really love you. We just got to check for $819. This is a church of 50 people."
[time=2843] The second church just called me Friday and said, "Passer, we want you to know that we're giving you $500 toward the trip to Bulgaria. I haven't even made my offering in my own church yet."
[time=2857] Let me tell you what we're going to do with those funds. We're going to put me up at the Sheraton.
[time=2863] What we're going to do with those funds is we're going to take every Bulgarian student who is going in a pastoral ministry.
[time=2874] You know what a Bulgarian makes on the average? You make $70 a month on an average. That's what an average will do.
[time=2881] You know what a medical doctor in Bulgaria makes? On the average, a medical doctor makes $140 a month.
[time=2887] Try to imagine buying books on an income of $70 a month. I don't think most pastors are paid $70 a month in Bulgaria.
[time=2895] What I'd like to tell you quickly is this. We're going to take that money and we're going to buy a starter kit for every student entering ministry in Bulgaria.
[time=2903] We're going to buy them a Hebrew dictionary. We're going to buy them a Hebrew concordance and we're going to buy them a book that tells them how to find the words in their Hebrew Bible in their Hebrew dictionary.
[time=2911] Because without it they can't find anything. And I believe God is going to use those students to turn Bulgaria upside down for the Lord because I've seen what they can do with my own eyes and that's where I want to lay down my encouragement to you.
[time=2927] Galatians chapter 6, Paul gave us some very encouraging promises and those promises read like this in Galatians chapter 6.
[time=2937] In Galatians chapter 6 and verse 9, let us not lose heart in doing good.
[time=2942] And if you catch the word with me because it's the same word that was translated back in Ecclesiastes 3, "In due time we shall reap if we do not grow weary."
[time=2953] So then while we have opportunity, let us do good to all men and especially to those who are the household of God who are the household of faith.
[time=2962] Now what I want to do is encourage you with this. God appoints the time and I'm telling you I've been a Christian this month is my 30th year of being a Christian.
[time=2974] And God has never yet phoned me. I haven't been phoned, faxed or had a vision.
[time=2982] But the fact is he does appoint the times. And what the apostle is telling us here is that our responsibility to buy out the time that he gives us, the opportunities that he sends our way.
[time=2997] Now that's easy to say and hard to do, but I'll tell you what I wanted to do when I heard the phone call say, "Man, you don't understand.
[time=3006] I'm in my last year. I'm teaching two and a half years of classes in one year." And let me tell you the rest.
[time=3014] God has revolutionized my life, my ministry, because I didn't say no to that time.
[time=3023] God has an appointed time for every last one of us. The Scripture says that even when we don't know Christ as our Savior, the Scripture tells us, "Don't you know now is the appointed time.
[time=3035] Now is the day of salvation. God's got a time for you right now. If you don't know Christ as your Savior, he set aside a time for you, redeem it.
[time=3044] Buy it out, take it, accept Jesus Christ as your Savior, because God is a God who is intervening in the lives of every last one of us, even when it doesn't very much feel like it.
[time=3056] And especially because we all seem so afflicted with this disease that says, "I'm not qualified."
[time=3069] Every pastor I know, almost every pastor I talk with, is discouraged with the problem of apathy in the Christian church.
[time=3082] And I think we're apathetic because what we have done is we have put ourselves in limbo.
[time=3094] We have disinvolved ourselves as beings that God could actually use.
[time=3100] Now I know that there are certain things that we have to limit.
[time=3103] Let me illustrate. This brother is sung. It's so hard for me not to be jealous.
[time=3108] When I came to know Christ as my Savior, my pastor, he told me, he said, "Donnie," he said, "I believe if God's calling you into ministry, he's going to give you some musical talent."
[time=3123] I think what he meant by that was he'll like music.
[time=3128] When I hear people use these kinds of talents, I get jealous.
[time=3133] But you're not going to convince me, mainly because I'm stubborn, but you're not going to convince me if we sit here from now for the next two months that God can't use you in some way, but he won't use you unless you're willing to say, "God, whatever."
[time=3148] And to believe that if you'll do that, the promise we have from Galatians is this.
[time=3155] God will allow you to reap in due time. What's due time?
[time=3162] Well, it's the time when God chooses to reward you for being true to him.
[time=3169] My church is being revolutionized because they have the faith to do things that their pastor doesn't.
[time=3176] And God in his good time is going to reward us in his own ways.
[time=3180] God's blessing us.
[time=3182] From last year, our attendance is up 25%. Our giving is up 25%.
[time=3187] God's blessing us.
[time=3189] But I think more than that kind of blessing, God is giving us a spirit of oneness and love that's just wonderful.
[time=3196] It makes Sunday the best experience of life.
[time=3200] I'll say one last word if I may here because all of this depends upon you knowing Christ as your Savior.
[time=3213] All of us only have so much time.
[time=3220] And none of us know when the time is going to be taken.
[time=3229] The time is near.
[time=3231] And my pleading to you is if you don't know Christ, friend, you have no guarantee that you have more time.
[time=3243] This might be the very time that the writer of Ecclesiastes would say God has appointed everything in his time beautiful.
[time=3255] And there could be nothing more beautiful than for you if you don't know Christ as your Savior to come to know him today.
[time=3262] It's the most beautiful experience of your life.
[time=3266] Now is the time.
[time=3268] And beloved, if you're here and you're a Christian, then I want to encourage you to just think with me like this.
[time=3274] Don't think that because you're a Christian, time is something that you can spend as you want.
[time=3281] There is an appointed time and appointed event God has it for you.
[time=3286] For me at least in the most powerful way perhaps of my license I came to know Christ.
[time=3291] It happened in a hallway when some guy named Michael Johnson is calling me up and saying, you want to come to Bulgaria?
[time=3299] Maybe it won't be that dramatic for you.
[time=3304] But the Bible is filled with stories of people who responded at crucial times.
[time=3309] Haggai preached a message in which Haggai said, is it time for you to live in your houses while this house lies desolate and they did what?
[time=3318] They went out and they rebuilt the temple.
[time=3321] God's people were about to be exterminated and Esther sees the time by choosing to die and going into the presence of a hajoueris and pleading for her people and God saved a whole people.
[time=3337] When is the time?
[time=3339] Well, it goes like this.
[time=3342] God orders it all up.
[time=3345] He's given every last one of us time and expects us to respond to it.
[time=3350] And maybe the key is learning to start out our weeks more theologically sensitive to the idea that this isn't just another week.
[time=3360] This is God's week because I'm in a world where God is working and I'm happy to tell you in Bulgaria, things are going very well indeed.
[time=3372] Praise God we thank you that in a world that it seems like you just don't work powerfully and dramatic anymore, that you still are doing so.
[time=3386] Thank you for my faithful people and their love for you and these other churches and I thank you for these faithful people.
[time=3392] And all we pray Father, all we ask if we know you as our Savior, all we ask is help us Father to use your time in ways that will bring honor and glory to you because you will then give to us joy and satisfaction.
[time=3406] And Father, if there are those here who don't know Christ as their Savior, your Holy Spirit surely can make them understand now is the time.
[time=3417] Work on our invitation hour, we pray in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3437] Well I hope you enjoyed the inspirational music from our sanctuary choir in orchestra and from Brian Losen and our organist Scott Schindler.
[time=3445] The message today was from our special guest Dr. Donald Fowler.
[time=3450] The Scripture says, "I am the way, the truth and the life, no man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[time=3456] I wonder today if you'd like to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3460] You know you can do that right now as we pray together.
[time=3463] If you want to take a moment and pray this prayer, why don't you pray with me?
[time=3467] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you for sending your Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross for my sins.
[time=3474] And today I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3479] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
[time=3482] I hope that you ask Christ to come into your heart today or if you prayed for another need, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your need.
[time=3489] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet that's entitled, "Lessons on Assurance." It'll help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
