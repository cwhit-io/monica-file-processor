[time=0] to try to bring you into the inside, I want you to do that, to try to bring you into the inside. I want you to just focus on the cross for a minute. And you can go to any country
[time=12] in the world and talk to almost anybody in that country and say, "What is that?" And
[time=20] they know exactly what you're talking about. And if you could understand their language, they would be able to tell you that is the cross, where they say Jesus died. But what
[time=31] they often might say is there's something missing in the scenario, and it would be to complete the silhouette there would be a cross on both sides, wouldn't there? Because as most everybody in the world knows, there were three people crucified on that particular day.
[time=58] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=64] find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Today in our study of God's Word,
[time=70] we come to a silhouette that is immediately recognized all around the world, the three crosses of Calvary. Almost anywhere you go, almost anyone you run into can tell you without
[time=81] much thought who was hanging on those three crosses. They were, of course, Jesus and the
[time=87] two criminals. We know that Christ hung on the cross in the middle. But how many of us
[time=93] know the two robbers who hung on either side of Christ? In a remarkable way, these two
[time=99] criminals represent every man and every woman who has ever lived. We each have the same problem
[time=107] these two men had, and we each have the exact same option they each had. Stay with us today
[time=114] and find out why. Our special music today on this Easter Sunday will be presented by our
[time=120] Sanctuary Choir and by Scott Schindler. Let's join our Sanctuary Choir as they begin our
[time=131] service.
[time=150] [MUSIC - 209 seconds]

Our address is the Bible hour, 7400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana.
[time=388] 46815. Now let's return to our service.
[time=393] [MUSIC - 155 seconds]
[time=568] We want to thank you for joining us today on the Bible hour. And I also want to thank you, many of you, who when we meet in public by chance, whether we're at the grocery store or at the hardware store or wherever it may be, many of you will come up and indicate that you watch the Bible hour on a regular basis. Oftentimes before you go to your own church on Sunday morning and you'll have an encouraging word to me. And I'm always thankful for that. It's good to know that people are listening to you.
[time=597] People are listening and caring and interested in the process. Others of you are writing us and we're thankful for that as well. From time to time we'll have people write in and indicate that they've prayed to receive Christ as a result of the program and we're always thrilled to have that kind of input. It keeps our energy high and our desire to serve the Lord even more fervent.
[time=621] And then others of you just write to let us know that we've encouraged you as you've been unable to get the church because of health reasons. And so we want you to know it means something to us when you do that. And we always are faithful to pray for your prayer requests. When you do send those into us, the staff sits down together and we pray through that and ask God to give you grace and mercy and strength in the particular situation you presented.
[time=646] And of course today for us is Easter and the program airs a week late this time and so you've already celebrated Easter Sunday but the tape and the message today is all about the wonder of what our Savior has done for us on the cross.
[time=661] And I talked today about a good friend Doug Sedam and his wife Melanie and the joy that I had building a relationship with them over time through our common interest in sports.
[time=672] After this incident we talk about today on the Bible hour in the teaching time where we were on vacation together and he brought up the topic of Easter and the meaning of Easter.
[time=682] When we finally got home from that trip Doug and Melanie began attending our church there in Southern California where faithful attenders and now even go on in a different church after we've left with a good friend of mine.
[time=693] And so we're thankful what God is doing in their life and it's just remarkable how if you'll open your life a little bit to people and let them get to know you, some of the real deep questions they have not just about Easter but parenting and how to struggle through a relationship with a friend and all the kinds of things.
[time=710] And so I just encourage you even as you're worshiping this Easter and thinking about all the marvelous blessings that have come your way because of Christ's sacrifice and his resurrection that you're sure to be inviting friends into your life.
[time=725] People who maybe have never been church to where you can spend time with them and take trips with them and have meals together with them and you watch they'll begin to ask you questions about your faith and that'll be your opportunity.
[time=736] So as we rejoice in this message about Easter and all that Christ has done we just pray that it will encourage your heart, it will renew your commitment to Christ and it will give you fresh opportunity to thank him for his death and his resurrection.
[time=766] [MUSIC - 272 seconds]
[time=1054] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1063] You don't have to stop just because he's leaving. I thought that was for me coming up. I'm sorry I got mixed up.
[time=1070] Try to hustle up as quick as I can because it gives me that feeling.
[time=1076] As I think about Easter there is a conversation that always comes back to my mind.
[time=1081] It's a conversation that Heidi and I had, my wife and I had with our next door neighbors.
[time=1086] Or maybe four or five years ago when we used to live in California we were traveling with our neighbors, Doug and Melanie Sedam taking a little bit of a trip together and we have been building a relationship with them over a period of time.
[time=1100] We knew them to be unchurched. They knew me to be a pastor and yet somehow we were finding common ground and some really fun activities like snow skiing which is where we were going on this particular trip.
[time=1112] We were in a restaurant and finally had finished gathering our food and things were settling down at the table and I'll never forget Doug's question.
[time=1119] He kind of out of the blue it was around the Easter season and I didn't really wasn't thinking about that so much in light of this particular relationship but he said to me he said now Russell what is the true meaning of Easter?
[time=1136] And I almost made a joke you know because you kind of figure that everybody knows that and I'm glad that I paused for just a minute and saw something in his face that indicated he wasn't like kind of pulling my leg here he really wanted to know.
[time=1151] He said to me right after that statement he went on to say this my mom was a Buddhist and so I never found out what Easter was about and could you tell me.
[time=1165] And I tell you I really respected him for that I mean here's a grown man 35 40 years of age just honestly openly saying I have no clue tell me.
[time=1175] That takes guts. I said Doug three things to know about Christianity we can wrap it up in three big days.
[time=1181] Christmas is the time when Jesus became a man God took the form of human flesh, Emmanuel God with us.
[time=1190] The second big day is good Friday the day when Christ was crucified for the sins of the world and then Doug the big one is Easter because that's when Jesus Christ came back from the dead.
[time=1205] And what's so big about that is that that was God's way of telling the entire world that what Christ did there on the cross was sufficient payment for our sin.
[time=1218] And by raising him from the dead God is putting his stamp of approval as if to say payment for people's sin paid in full I accept.
[time=1228] And I think he understood that.
[time=1231] But for many of you this morning that is not the question that's running through your mind you understand some of those facts maybe you've known those for years it's unlikely that many of you like Doug would have kind of been separated from that information.
[time=1243] The big question that's running through your mind this morning is so what I mean what difference does it make to my life.
[time=1253] What difference does Easter make to me and to the way I live my life and to my tomorrow and to the next day.
[time=1259] What difference does Easter make to the way I work to the way I relate to my spouse to my children to my friends.
[time=1267] Many of you come here this morning realizing that millions of people all over the world today are stopping to acknowledge that this is Easter in one religious service or another.
[time=1279] And you're wondering in your mind how many of these millions are just like you.
[time=1285] You're kind of understanding the facts about Easter but you're really missing the point I mean you know as you look in your heart you don't really get the big deal.
[time=1296] It's a little bit like being on the outside of an inside joke it's kind of what it may feel like you today.
[time=1303] You know you're standing in a group of people you know these people and one of your friends kind of has a one liner that busts most of the people up and they're just in hysterics they can't believe how funny that comment is but you miss it completely.
[time=1318] Because you weren't there when that whatever it was happened that inside situation that made that one liner so funny.
[time=1327] And so you kind of come this morning going through the motions I mean you're a part of the whole thing you have a general understanding of the facts but as you look around you can sense that some of the people are really excited about Easter.
[time=1341] I mean it means something to them personally and you honestly look in your own heart and you go I'm on the outside I don't get it.
[time=1354] I got the facts but I don't really get it.
[time=1358] Well I want to take a shot this morning at explaining to you the inside information.
[time=1365] And my hope is when you walk out of here today you'll be able to say I get it I get it.
[time=1371] I'm on the inside now I figured it out okay thanks for explaining it to me.
[time=1376] Not in a general way in a very personal way my hope is that when you walk out these doors today you will understand personally how relevant and life changing Easter can be to you.
[time=1390] And to do that I'm going to ask you to focus your attention on that cross.
[time=1394] Now you know as our world becomes this global village and everybody knows everybody and we fly everywhere and we talk to everybody that we've kind of needed as a world to come up with some universal signs.
[time=1404] And so pretty much now you can put anything you want inside of a circle draw a line through and that means don't do it.
[time=1409] Somebody walking is in the picture a line don't walk.
[time=1412] There's a dog so a line through don't dog you know no dogs here.
[time=1415] There's a cigarette with smoke a line through it no smoking.
[time=1418] Long before these universal international signs came into existence there was this one.
[time=1424] And for 2000 years basically everybody in any particular country you could go anywhere in the world and ask anybody in that country what is that about.
[time=1434] And they'll be able to tell you that's where they say Jesus was crucified.
[time=1441] Now most of the people might still feel that same empty feeling like I missed the point of that I don't really understand the relevance of that but I understand what that thing is about.
[time=1449] That's a universal sign.
[time=1451] It's missing two things though.
[time=1453] The two crosses that go on either side of it.
[time=1456] Because pretty much what you've got in a universal recognition of a silhouette standing there in the shadows of the evening there's this rounded mountain and on top of it are three lonely crosses.
[time=1469] And that silhouette is well recognized all around the world.
[time=1474] And you say how in the world is looking at that cross and what I need you to do this morning is to kind of imagine the two on either side of it.
[time=1483] The one on either side making a total of three because I want to talk to you about the other two crosses that aren't here this morning.
[time=1490] And the two guys that were on those two crosses.
[time=1496] And you say now how is that going to help us walk out of here with a personal understanding of the relevance of Easter?
[time=1503] Well it's this.
[time=1505] Those two criminals, those two robbers represent every single human being who has ever lived.
[time=1513] I mean they are who they were in real history, but their experience parallels everybody else's experience who has ever lived.
[time=1523] Let me make it even more plain here.
[time=1526] Two things I want to say about these guys.
[time=1528] One, everybody who's ever lived shares the same problem that they had.
[time=1534] Secondly, everybody who's ever lived has the exact same option that those two guys had.
[time=1542] And so by looking at their problem and how it relates to our problem and by looking at their option and how it relates to our option I hope that when we're finished you'll get the joke.
[time=1556] You'll be on the inside.
[time=1558] First of all, if you have a Bible this morning and if you don't I really encourage you to look across the lap there at somebody else's next to you.
[time=1567] Come with me to the book of Luke.
[time=1569] It's one of the gospels, Luke 23.
[time=1573] Because this is where the story of these two criminals is told.
[time=1581] And we'll focus on the simple fact that we all share the same problem.
[time=1588] Their problem is our problem.
[time=1591] Luke 23, now verse 32 and 33, I'll just read these.
[time=1596] And again let me encourage you to peek over and look at a Bible if you didn't bring one just so you can be sure that I'm reading it right.
[time=1606] And two others also who were criminals were being led away to be put to death with him.
[time=1613] The him is obviously Jesus, the two criminals are the guys on those crosses that are going to get crucified there, verse 33.
[time=1619] And when they came to the place called the skull, there they crucified him and the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.
[time=1629] There's our silhouette.
[time=1630] That's where that imagery comes from.
[time=1631] That's that historical event.
[time=1634] Now it's remarkable how much we don't know about these guys.
[time=1638] We have no idea how old they were when they got crucified.
[time=1643] We have no idea what race they were, whether they were Romans, whether they were from the Jewish community, whether they from some other country.
[time=1651] And I've just been doing their plundering there in Palestine and been convicted and put to death.
[time=1657] We have no idea about their background.
[time=1660] We know nothing about their parents, we know nothing about their education, we know nothing about previous employment.
[time=1666] We just know that they are called, if you look at verse 33, they are called criminals.
[time=1672] But that word is very specific.
[time=1675] Not in our language, in the English language, but in the language that this book was written originally in the Greek, they used a very specific word there for criminal.
[time=1683] Lace taste in the Greek and it's not talking about a common petty thief, which makes sense because why would you crucify a common petty thief?
[time=1696] These were robbers, these were thieves, but a particular brand of robber noted for the fact that they took real pleasure in torturing, abusing and eventually killing the people they were robbing for.
[time=1712] It wasn't enough for this particular group of people, type of criminal, to steal from them, they had some type of something inside of them that took pleasure in the abuse and in the torture and in the eventual death of their victim.
[time=1733] You're trying to tell me that I have a common problem, you're trying to tell me that their problem is not only common to me, but common to everyone who's ever lived.
[time=1744] And you say to yourself, I have never broken the law of the United States of America, I haven't stolen anything like that, and I certainly don't take pleasure in harming anybody.
[time=1755] What are you talking about? Where is this common link you're talking about that I have the same problem they do?
[time=1762] Well in reality there are three common links in our like problem.
[time=1767] First of all, they have broken the law and so have we.
[time=1770] You say you mean I spend some time in my car, big deal, that's not going to put me on a cross.
[time=1775] Well if you'll go beyond the law of the land and think for a moment about the law of God, you're going to your mind ten commandments, yeah?
[time=1784] Maybe I have lied, maybe I have stolen from time to time, it's small ways, little ways.
[time=1793] Maybe I have coveted someone else's property or person, maybe I've committed adultery, yeah I guess, I guess if you're going to talk about now the law of God, I see what you mean, I have broken the law.
[time=1807] And if you'll go a little deeper in your understanding of God's definition of his law, he's talking about what he calls the law of love.
[time=1815] Which is a tough standard, it means that in every relationship you're in you have to love that person self-sacrificially, you know that good old fashioned stuff we call selfishness.
[time=1825] Every time you and I act in a selfish way we are breaking the law of God.
[time=1832] So we find ourselves really kind of identified with these guys, if we're going to raise the ante a little bit and let it be viewed from God's perspective, we too have broken the law.
[time=1845] We also relate to them in their problem because we tend to take pleasure, not in torturing people, but in breaking God's law.
[time=1854] Have you ever been really mad at somebody because they did something to you? And you worked it out in your mind what you were going to say to them and you got the right moment and you just let it rip?
[time=1864] I mean you just were, you were verbose that day, you had the golden tongue and it just flew off your lips and into them and you could see it really stuck it to them and you walked away going man that felt good.
[time=1877] Yeah, that's called enjoying and taking pleasure in your sin.
[time=1883] Have you ever stolen from the IRS?
[time=1887] You know the big bad guy that God says you're supposed to pay him whatever he asks because God put him in charge even if it's unreasonable?
[time=1896] Have you ever cheated in that area and walked away with the extra money and said man am I glad I held this back?
[time=1904] This is going to pay for my family vacation.
[time=1907] This is going to provide for future college education.
[time=1910] This is going to handle some real financial struggles in my life.
[time=1913] That's called taking pleasure in your sin.
[time=1919] Have you ever deceived someone?
[time=1922] Have you ever done something that you shouldn't have done and you knew you didn't want to take the embarrassment of just owning up to what you did and so you came up with a clever explanation which you call a clever explanation and I do too sometimes but what God calls a lie?
[time=1936] And when you found out that those people bought your explanation you kind of walked away saying I'm glad I'm out of that one.
[time=1943] I'm glad they didn't ask me one more question. I'm sure I'm glad they didn't figure that thing out.
[time=1949] It's called taking pleasure in your sin.
[time=1953] The Bible talks about the passing pleasures of sin for a season.
[time=1958] So like these criminals we have broken the law, the law of God.
[time=1962] Like these criminals we have taken pleasure in our sin and now thirdly like these criminals are common problem.
[time=1972] Is that we too have been condemned to death.
[time=1979] The Bible says that the wages of sin is death and if you commit sin against God you're going to pay for it with your life.
[time=1986] Not even just your physical life.
[time=1988] The Bible talks about this payment as a spiritual punishment that goes on after physical death.
[time=1997] You say well how do I know that there's this? How do I know I'm under judgment?
[time=2002] I mean these guys knew they were under judgment. They were hanging on a cross.
[time=2005] It was pretty obvious that they'd been condemned. How do I know that I'm under the sentence of death?
[time=2009] It's this little word called guilt.
[time=2013] Guilt. And God graciously gives it to you when you violate his law.
[time=2019] And you know you get away with that really picturesque outburst of your anger in the presence of that person who hurt you.
[time=2029] And you walk away from them feeling good but pretty soon that feeling goes away and it's replaced with another feeling isn't it?
[time=2036] Man I've compromised who I am. They might even have deserved that but that was pretty ugly.
[time=2043] And I feel pretty guilty about it.
[time=2047] You might fool the IRS. You might fool your employer and steal from your workplace.
[time=2052] And there might be an immediate sense of joy in response to that but eventually the other feelings catch up and you say uh oh.
[time=2061] This is more than I bargained for. I feel really compromised as a human being here.
[time=2066] I don't feel whole. I don't feel complete.
[time=2069] I'm having a little trouble sleeping. I feel like my world's kind of closing in on me and I'm now embarrassed of what I am
[time=2076] and what I have done. And now I have to work really hard to rationalize my behavior and say it over and over again to myself. They deserve to be spoken that way.
[time=2085] Or that government deserve to have me take their money. Or I deserve to not have to be embarrassed so I lied.
[time=2091] But even those repetitive sentences that we say to ourselves they begin to wear out and this continual nagging from the spirit of God
[time=2100] convicts us over and over. I'm guilty. Oh, I'm guilty.
[time=2105] Like a red light on your dashboard in your car. It's actually a very good thing to have
[time=2111] because it lets you know before it's too late you better fix something underneath the hood.
[time=2116] That's what guilt is. Guilt is God's red light on the dashboard of your life saying you might be able to think everything's going okay but you're under the sentence of death and we need to deal with this problem.
[time=2128] It's not going to go away. We need to deal with this problem.
[time=2135] So at a first blush glance at these two criminals I stand up in here and say we have a remarkable amount in common with them.
[time=2146] We share a common problem and you go what are you talking about but you'll look a little deeper into the situation.
[time=2151] All of a sudden yeah I might not be the same age. I might not be the same race.
[time=2155] I might not have the same background and I might not actually be a thief.
[time=2160] But good night we got a lot in common. We kind of have a kindred spirit here. Me and these criminals.
[time=2167] Because I have broken the law of God and I do take pleasure in my sin and come to think of it.
[time=2174] That red light you're talking about has been on quite a little bit lately and I don't really know what to do about it.
[time=2184] Well let's move then from the common problem to the common option.
[time=2191] And this is equally as true. We all have the same option with the person of Christ, the guy in the middle as the two guys on the outside did.
[time=2199] And so does everybody who's ever lived. And the option is really simple.
[time=2204] One you have the option to reject him. Two you have the option to accept him. Reject or accept. That's it.
[time=2214] That's what everybody who has ever lived including you is going to do with him.
[time=2219] You're going to either accept him or you're going to reject him.
[time=2224] Now as we look into this story a little bit more we can understand what these options entail.
[time=2229] Back over there at Luke 23 the story kind of goes on a little more and it explains how each guy handled his option.
[time=2236] In verse 39 we get a look at the first thief and I wish I could tell you he was on the right side or the left side but the Bible doesn't tell us.
[time=2243] You just got to pick a side okay for this first thief. Which side are you going to be on?
[time=2248] In verse 39 one of the criminals who was hanged there was hurling abuse at him saying are you not the Christ save yourself and us.
[time=2260] He's hurling abuse. We will take time this morning to explain that to you but everybody else around that cross watching this crucifixion there's some religious leaders down there and they're saying the same stuff.
[time=2271] If you're really Jesus if you're really God if you're really who you say you are it was a very sarcastic taunting rhetorical question then save yourself then just come right down off the cross.
[time=2286] The word for hurling abuse is the word blasphemy in the Greek and we translated in the English blasphemy.
[time=2295] To reject Christ is to blaspheme against him.
[time=2301] To say I don't want any of what you're offering I reject you.
[time=2306] The second option is found in verses 40 and following.
[time=2309] Look at this other guy but the other answered and rebuking him said do you not even fear God since you are under the same sentence of condemnation.
[time=2320] And we indeed justly for we are receiving that we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong and he was saying Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom.
[time=2334] And Jesus said to him truly I say to you today you shall be with me in paradise.
[time=2339] Now let's go a little deeper try to understand what's really going on here.
[time=2344] Two options except reject let's look first at what it means to accept Christ.
[time=2349] And let's just take this guy's words let's let him be the model for us because Jesus was pretty willing to accept him wasn't he.
[time=2356] At the end of that thing he says you'll be in paradise with me so he apparently knows what it means this thief to accept Christ.
[time=2363] That's very very clear let's look at it together.
[time=2368] In verse 40 but the other answered and rebuking him said number one do you not even fear God.
[time=2378] The first step the first step in accepting Christ as your Savior is to fear God.
[time=2389] It's to take a look at that warning light on your dashboard in your life not your car.
[time=2394] And say you know what that's there for a reason it shows up every single time I violate what the Bible calls the law of love.
[time=2402] And it's the greatest proof to me in all the world that there is a God and there is a Savior because every time I violate the moral code inside of this book that red light comes on.
[time=2415] And you know it's not just me it's not just my society as I look around the world it's true of all the other societies.
[time=2422] There is no society in the world where selfishness is considered a virtue.
[time=2429] That's a universal truth everybody understands that.
[time=2433] And every time I'm selfish this cotton-picking red light goes on in the dashboard of my brain and in my soul and it distracts me and it bothers me and it takes away the fun of my life.
[time=2444] I'm going to honor that red light and I'm going to understand that it's God's warning to me that I should fear him if I don't deal with Christ.
[time=2454] The Bible says that when you die in your sins you stand before him and you suffer the consequences for rejecting Christ.
[time=2462] So step one in option of accepting Christ is to fear God.
[time=2468] Look at what else he did in verse 41. He said this and we indeed justly.
[time=2477] In other words he's saying we're getting crucified today justly for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong.
[time=2486] Step two is to confess your sin to take full responsibility for your own behavior. See what that thief is doing?
[time=2493] He's saying I deserve to die on this cross and he's rebuking his buddy across the other side of Christ saying you do too.
[time=2500] We're just getting what we deserve.
[time=2504] Boy what a refreshing thought. Are you like totally sick of all the stuff that's going on inside of our political leaders where you just have this nagging feeling nobody's going to just step up to the plate and say I did it it was my fault.
[time=2522] We don't know who knew what in the Contra affairs. We don't know who knew what in Watergate.
[time=2528] We don't know who knew what in whitewater. We don't know anything anymore because nobody will just step up to the plate and say this is what I did and I deserve my just punishment.
[time=2541] This thief shows us very clearly that part of accepting Christ as your savior is stepping up to the plate and say I'm being crucified today and I deserve it.
[time=2554] I'm a sinner and I'm not going to blame it on my mom and dad and I'm not going to blame it on my first grade teacher and I'm not going to blame it on society and I'm not going to blame it on the fact that there were elephants in my wallpaper when I was a child in my nursery.
[time=2569] I did it and I chose to do it and maybe some of those things had an influence on it but in the final analysis I pulled the trigger or I stole the money or I said the selfish word or I did the unkind act.
[time=2586] It was me and I deserve to be punished for my behavior. Then that sound refreshing to you. Step one is to acknowledge the red light.
[time=2596] Fear God and the consequences of dying in your sin. Step two is finally for once in your life and be different than most everybody else and step up to the plate and say I did it. It's my fault. I deserve the punishment.
[time=2610] Step three. Look at verse 41 again. At the end of that thing he says you know for we are receiving what we deserve for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong.
[time=2622] Who's he talking about? Talking about the guy in the middle. Jesus. He's saying Jesus hasn't done anything wrong. Jesus doesn't deserve to die. He's sinless.
[time=2633] Now that's a heavy statement. This criminal no doubt had heard the word that Jesus was God and that Jesus had never sinned and that's what qualified him to die for everybody else's sins.
[time=2643] Jesus wasn't just a guy that was nice. I mean he was perfect, sinless, spotless, true and living God who could be sacrificed for our sins.
[time=2652] And so the third thing that this repentant thief does is he honors the person of Christ for who he truly is. He accepts Christ's definition of himself.
[time=2662] What he's saying is that's God there buddy. You know the guy you're just cursing at? You're cursing at God. He doesn't deserve to die. He's blameless.
[time=2673] So he feared God. He confessed his sin. He honored Christ and then watched this. He had his own little four letter word for Jesus. Help.
[time=2685] H-E-L-P. Help me. Verse 42. And when he was saying, he says this, Jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom. That's kind of a clumsy way to ask to be saved. I admit, I think it was pretty unrehearsed. The guy is getting crucified. He isn't a little bit of pain.
[time=2713] But it's starting to dawn on him. What's going on in his life and that he's responsible for his sin and that if he dies this way, he's going to be judged and so he doesn't know much how to say it. So he just says it this way. Jesus remember me when you get into your kingdom.
[time=2727] It's a very humble, clear, simple cry for help. He's asking to be forgiven. He's asking to be saved.
[time=2742] And I think it worked because look, I know it worked because look at verse 43. And he said to him, "Namely Jesus, Jesus said to this guy, 'Truly I say to you today, you shall be with me in paradise.'"
[time=2755] In other words, I forgive you because nobody goes, paradise is heaven and nobody goes to heaven unless they've had their sin problem dealt with through Christ.
[time=2766] So there's the option. Option one, in my opinion, the preferable option of accepting Christ.
[time=2774] You fear God, you confess your sin, you honor Christ for who he really is, the true and living God, and you cry out for help to be saved from your sin, and God forgives you.
[time=2788] Let's talk about the other option. It's the blaspheming option. It's the rejecting option.
[time=2794] And right now you're thinking, hold it. Couldn't there be like a third? I mean, there's three crosses. Couldn't we have like a third option?
[time=2800] I mean, are you going to push me all the way over here into a clenched fist rebellion against Christ? I don't think that's fair. I don't think that's me.
[time=2809] I mean, I agree. I haven't done what that guy did over there in Option one. That's not me. I agree with that.
[time=2814] But are you going to push me all the way over to here in rejection of Christ, cursing him, blaspheming him?
[time=2821] You say, I don't think that's right. Well, think with me for a minute.
[time=2825] It may be because your definition of blasphemy is a little too narrow.
[time=2829] Let me tell you what it means to blaspheme Christ.
[time=2833] I'll give you a four common things that people do that are actually blaspheming Christ, and they think they're being nice to Christ.
[time=2840] They think they're really honoring Christ in these four ways. In reality, according to the Bible, it's actually blasphemy.
[time=2846] Number one, to believe that Jesus is anything less than the true and living God is to blaspheme him.
[time=2858] I hear this all the time. People want to be kind because they know I'm a poor little preacher boy at a Baptist church.
[time=2863] And when they find that out, they want to say some nice things to me. So they say things like, you know, Jesus was a wonderful man.
[time=2869] A very good man, but a man. And they think that they're honoring Christ by calling him a good man, some say the best man that ever lived.
[time=2881] Others say, you know, he was a phenomenal teacher. I mean, look at how his writings have been all over the world.
[time=2888] No author, no writer, no leader. I mean, he was a great, great teacher and leader.
[time=2894] And they think they're honoring him when they say that. Or they say, you know what? Jesus was a great example.
[time=2901] And I think the greatest example of all time. In fact, I think everyone should follow his example.
[time=2906] And they reduce him to a mere man, a man who might have been a good teacher, a man who might have been a good leader, a man who might have been a good example, but a man.
[time=2916] And they think they're honoring God in Christ. In reality, they are blaspheming Christ.
[time=2923] Because Jesus said, I am. What he meant by that? I have always been and I will always be.
[time=2930] I have always been in the state of existence. I am the true and the living God.
[time=2935] Yes, I took the form of human man, but I am God. And unless you can call me God from the depths of your heart,
[time=2943] if you reduce me to any form of man, no matter how great a man that might be, you blaspheme me.
[time=2951] That's pretty blasphemous, isn't it? Calling God nothing but a creature?
[time=2955] The second thing that people do, and I hear this all the time too.
[time=2961] People think they're like getting above it all and they're kind of like getting God's big perspective on the world when they hear about all these various and different religions.
[time=2970] And they say, you know, I think that really all of the religions of the world lead to the same place.
[time=2978] And they mean this in their heart. And they think they're honoring God in these words.
[time=2983] Whether you come by the road of Buddhism, or whether you come by the road of Confucius, or whether you come through the Muslim way, whether you come through.
[time=2992] It doesn't really, it just really doesn't matter. It's just we're all going on the same path, on the same direction, and some of us call it different names.
[time=3003] Do you realize how blasphemous that is to Christ? You say, why? Doesn't He like that spirit of brotherly love?
[time=3011] Jesus has said this, I am the way. I am the truth. And no man comes unto the Father but by Me.
[time=3025] And so when a person thinking their honoring God says, oh, you know, everybody's going to end up in heaven together through their various roads.
[time=3034] They are saying, Jesus, you're not the only way. You're not the only truth. And we can get to God a thousand different ways besides you.
[time=3044] It's blasphemous, absolutely blasphemous, and is rejecting Him because He will only let you accept Him on His terms.
[time=3055] You have to accept Him for what He is. The third way that I hear people blaspheme Christ is by believing that Jesus is the Savior, that Jesus, you know, Christmas, good Friday, Easter, all that stuff.
[time=3070] They believe all that stuff, and they believe they're going to get saved, but it's going to be through their faith in Christ plus their good works.
[time=3078] And you say to them, are you saved? They say, well, I don't know yet. I'm not sure because I'm still working at it.
[time=3087] Do you believe in Jesus? Yes. Do you believe Jesus died for your sins? Yes. Do you believe Jesus rose from the dead? Yes.
[time=3093] Are you saved? I don't know. Why? Well, because I don't know how my good works are going to fit in. I don't know if I'll be able to add to what Jesus has done so that in the final analysis, God will look at my faith in Jesus plus my good works and He'll say you're safe.
[time=3107] You know what? That's blasphemous. And there are thousands and thousands and thousands of people believing that they're honoring Christ in that system.
[time=3120] Jesus said that you can't be saved by your works. Jesus said your works have absolutely nothing to do with becoming saved.
[time=3127] And Jesus said, if you try to earn salvation, you make my sacrifice worthless because I paid for all the sins of the world.
[time=3138] I did it all. All you have to do is accept it. And when you say that accepting it isn't enough, you blaspheme against me and you make my death and you make my resurrection of no account.
[time=3153] Jesus came to be the Savior of the world. Jesus did not come to be the helper of the world. It is not a divine cooperative in which you work together and somehow you and Jesus get enough brownie points to earn your way to heaven.
[time=3164] Jesus said, I have paid for all the sins of all the world. The only thing that is left for you to do is to humble yourself to the point of saying I can't deserve or earn heaven.
[time=3176] Jesus, please remember me. Help. Help in the absolute sense. And worst of all, this fourth way, the fourth way that people blaspheme is they believe in everything about Jesus and they don't believe the works things.
[time=3194] But the belief is up here in their head, you see, from early on they have believed about Christmas and about good Friday and about Easter.
[time=3203] They've always kind of believed that. I mean, they do. They don't believe in any other religion. They just believe in that, but they never really taken it into their heart.
[time=3211] It's never become a personal transaction between them and the person of Christ where they have submitted their life to him.
[time=3220] And they think they're honoring Jesus by not rejecting him. They think, well, he can't be too upset with me. I mean, I haven't thrown him away.
[time=3228] I haven't adopted a different religious system. I'm still believing that he's the one. I just haven't decided yet if I'm really going to put my faith in him for my salvation.
[time=3239] Absolutely blasphemous to Christ. Christ calls for a radical commitment from the individual to him for salvation, not some type of a distant intellectual assent to his reality.
[time=3252] It's got to go past information. It's got to go into the heart. And when it's not in the heart, it's a blasphemous relationship.
[time=3261] So you say, oh, I understand what you mean now. I get it. You're right. I mean, I've never, just like custard Christ.
[time=3272] But if blasphemy includes this broader definition, and it does, I see. I'm blasphemous. I'm standing in a blasphemous position against Christ.
[time=3295] So where are you? If we're going to get this thing to be meaningful to you, so that you're not on the outside of it anymore, but you really understand the inside of it, which cross are you on? I mean, you're obviously not in the middle.
[time=3309] Are you over here with the rejecting blasphemous Christ? Excuse me, criminal? Or are you on the other side? Have you come to that place? You know what the greatest tragedy in this whole silhouette is?
[time=3325] The guy who blasphemed Christ died that day in his sin. I mean, he was right there in the process of dying in the crucifixion, and he was literally inches away from the person of Christ, the one who could have saved him.
[time=3338] And apart from the nails that were in their hands, they might have been able to reach. They were so close and touch each other. I mean, that's how close this guy was to salvation.
[time=3347] But he died that day in his sin. And that same thing happens inside of churches, happens inside of these kinds of situations where today you are within inches of true salvation.
[time=3362] You are, in fact, only one prayer away from true salvation.
[time=3371] But you've got to exercise your option. And if you don't reach out, and if you don't cry out help, and you don't accept Christ on his terms,
[time=3384] and if you die that way, you die like this one guy in the cross who died in his sins, who then had for all eternity what he had had all his life, separation from God.
[time=3404] We've heard some triumphal music from our sanctuary choir and some inspirational music from our organist, Scott Schindler. I hope you enjoyed this resurrection music.
[time=3414] The message today was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore. This would be a wonderful day for you to just take a moment and say, "You know, I've never accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior, and I'd like to do that today. You can do it by praying this prayer. Let's pray it together."
[time=3429] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that you've come to die on the cross and to rise again for my sins. Lord, I ask your forgiveness of the sins that I've committed, and forgive me for doing that.
[time=3441] And come into my heart today and be my Savior. In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3448] If you prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision. When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance." It'll help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
