[time=0] But my expectations are that some good marriages in our church, by virtue of this time together
[time=7] and God's Word will get better, some marriages in our church right now that are stuck, will get moving again, and other marriages that just flat out are near death and ready to
[time=18] keel over will be resurrected.
[time=34] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=40] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=42] Thank you for joining us.
[time=44] How in the world is this thing called marriage supposed to work?
[time=49] Many find that it feels more like a commitment to coexist rather than an exciting dynamic relationship.
[time=55] For God's Word can help.
[time=58] No quick fixes, no magic formulas, just real answers that lead in genuine intimacy.
[time=65] Our special music today will be presented by our hand bell choir and by Stephen Maria
[time=73] and Mandy Gardner.
[time=78] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=82] [MUSIC], the truth is not that we're dead, the truth was sealed in our, the groove of
[time=104] all of every heart, the Son of God, the Lord of life, my death and this road.
[time=118] In the silence of the turn, he heard his Father's voice, arise arise arise arise arise
[time=133] were sorrow the morning skies upon, by anointed one, to eternal light, arise arise as a way
[time=152] arise arise, by anointed one, to eternal light, arise.
[time=165] [MUSIC - 114 seconds]
[time=306] Mother's Day is fast approaching and the Bible hour would like to pay tribute to mothers with a very special free gift.
[time=313] This beautiful 24 carat gold plated rose pin is being offered free to all our Bible hour mothers who write and request one.
[time=321] Our mothers provide support, encouragement and life at a time when the family is under its harshest attack.
[time=326] Please write today for your free Mother's Day pin.
[time=329] Our address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=336] Now let's return to our service.
[time=339] [MUSIC - 94 seconds]
[time=450] [APPLAUSE]
[time=457] Thank you for joining us for the Bible hour today. We appreciate the fact that you've joined in with us.
[time=462] Earlier on our telecast, Jeff Carlson mentioned the fact that we are offering on the Bible hour a small gold rose in commemoration of Mother's Day.
[time=472] If you'd like to receive one of those be sure and get your request in soon.
[time=476] We'd like to hear from you and we'll send you that beautiful gold rose, a pin that you can put on your lapel and be beautiful reminding you of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=486] Join in with us and write to us today.
[time=489] Russell, we have a new series that will begin this service.
[time=493] Yeah, we're excited about starting a discussion on the topic of marriage.
[time=498] And as you know, Peter, the marriages in our country and even in the church are in a lot of trouble.
[time=504] There is really no difference statistically in the number of divorces inside the church.
[time=508] With outside the church, basically the whole thing is running about 50% of the marriages end up in divorce.
[time=514] And of course in our church, that is not the case.
[time=518] Our percentage would be very, very, very small.
[time=521] But we're still concerned that we're giving attention to and trying to strengthen and support people's understanding of marriage and to keep it on the front burner.
[time=530] And so we're hopeful that God will use this series.
[time=533] In preparation for the messages, are you giving steps that they can improve the marriage or more like concepts?
[time=541] Well, we're going to stay away from steps. I mean, by and large, there may be a few.
[time=545] But as we'll develop in the series, as any good relationship, it's not a product of doing one, two, and three.
[time=553] That may be in the infant stages of a relationship.
[time=557] But whether you're working with somebody in business or whether you're in an athletic endeavor or whether you're in a marriage, the thing that makes your relationship exciting is that that other person is really bringing what they are to the table.
[time=570] And creatively looking to participate in this with you.
[time=574] And a lot of times when the training reduces itself to certain steps that you do, a person can do those steps, but their energy and their life and their passion isn't there.
[time=586] And that creates worse problems because the wife is insulted that the husband would think so little would suffice.
[time=594] Now, we're talking about marriage. And some of you that might be single out there, you might be thinking, well, maybe the next few weeks, I won't tune in.
[time=601] But Russell, I know that you're going to do some relating to singles and those that anticipate getting married in the near future.
[time=607] Definitely. The dynamics that go on in a marriage relationship are only magnified, but obviously short of the physical community that goes on instead of a marriage.
[time=618] All the other principles are biblical principles that can be applied and should be applied in the relationships we have with other believers.
[time=626] And in a large part, trying to build a genuine authentic relationship with an unbeliever, the principles we're going to communicate will do you well.
[time=634] And so please, if you're not married, don't be intimidated by that. Stay with us and we'll try to help you with that.
[time=639] Well, I just want to remind you again that it'll be important for you to stay tuned for the next several Sundays, although each message will be complete in itself.
[time=647] This will be a series of messages on the relationship between the husband and wife, and I hope that you'll stay tuned with us.
[time=654] Many of you write in and are encouraged by the music and then the message. It's a total package where we hope it will strengthen your Christian walk.
[time=662] If you've never received Jesus Christ as your Savior, you can even know that today as we conclude our service with an invitation. Thank you very much for joining us today.
[time=692] He sends a rainbow as soon as the sunrise will follow the night. He sends a sunlight right through the rain and covers the world with his mind.
[time=708] Whenever it rains, God sends a rainbow and that's just the start of God's love.
[time=723] Whenever you're lost to what's beside you, he isn't a fickle of their weather friend.
[time=732] Whenever you're lost, he's not denied you.
[time=736] You're the good and the bad, he will stay to the end.
[time=741] He knows where you've been, he knows where you're going, and he's loved to show you the way.
[time=750] Whenever you're lost to what's beside you, then that's just the start of God's love.
[time=760] When your life is all done, you'll live forever.
[time=766] He's gone on ahead to prepare you a place.
[time=771] When life is all done, you'll live forever.
[time=775] Just to think, just to see him across face to face, his promise will be for his love is so deep
[time=784] that he died to make it so.
[time=789] So when your life is all done, you'll live forever.
[time=795] And that's just the start of God's.
[time=810] We live a life that is so limited here on this planet.
[time=813] We can't begin to comprehend the extent of God's love for us.
[time=819] Sometimes when we don't feel his love because of events in our lives, we're tempted to think that maybe he's been distracted, maybe he's forgotten about who we are and what we're going through.
[time=830] But inevitably, we find, as King David always did, you see it over and over again through the Psalms,
[time=836] the recognition that God delights in rescuing his children.
[time=842] He delights in providing everything that they need.
[time=854] Oh Lord, my soul longs for you.
[time=860] In this my time of great need, I fear you have left me alone.
[time=872] There is no one who cares, who can answer my prayers.
[time=878] Lord, I feel I am sinking like stone.
[time=884] But Lord, You've promised to hear when I cry out in prayer, when I search for You with all my might.
[time=894] So please hear me now in this hour of despair.
[time=899] Turn my darkness into your light.
[time=903] You are a rescuing God, You are a saving Lord.
[time=908] And in delight in the sound of your children's praise.
[time=911] You are a rescuing God, You are a saving Lord.
[time=914] And I will praise Your name through all my days.
[time=920] Oh Lord, my eyes can now see the sin that I've hidden from You.
[time=930] The price that it's caused me to pay.
[time=935] All the pain and despair, even sickness to bear,
[time=942] and the shame and reproach of this day.
[time=947] But now I open my heart and I humbly repent of the sin I've committed against You.
[time=957] And for the time that I have so foolishly spent in hiding from Your holy view.
[time=966] You are a rescuing God, You are a saving Lord.
[time=971] And in delight in the sound of your children's praise.
[time=974] You are a rescuing God, You are a saving Lord.
[time=977] And I will praise Your name through all my days.
[time=981] You are a rescuing God, You are a saving Lord.
[time=984] And in delight in the sound of your children's praise.
[time=987] You are a rescuing God, You are a saving Lord.
[time=991] And I will praise Your name through all my days.
[time=1002] Oh praise His name.
[time=1015] Boy that is beautiful. Thank You.
[time=1017] You guys sing so well together as a family.
[time=1019] Six more kids and you could have been the gardener of Entrop family.
[time=1025] Things like Edelweiss and that stuff, you know.
[time=1029] I don't know.
[time=1031] Let's take our Bibles and come to Genesis chapter 2.
[time=1037] Genesis chapter 2 and I'd like to start a series this morning on Marriage.
[time=1043] And as you know, we finished up the book of Philippians and then we kind of embarked on to a number of topical messages.
[time=1051] And we ended up with three messages on spiritual turning points.
[time=1056] And then we celebrated together Palm and Easter Sunday.
[time=1060] And now I'd like to move towards marriage.
[time=1063] And I do that for a number of reasons.
[time=1065] As I had requested you all wrote me little notes, not everybody, but a great number of people did.
[time=1070] Marriage just kept coming up over and over and over again as something that you'd like to hear about, be encouraged in.
[time=1077] The survey that we recently took revealed that about 65% of the men, married men in our congregation would like some instruction and help and encouragement in the way they love their wives.
[time=1087] And about 54% of the wives indicated that they would also like some help.
[time=1093] Beyond that, if you think very deeply at all about society and even the church itself, primarily the church itself, you'll realize very quickly that a church is strong because it is built with strong families.
[time=1107] And that is to mitigate the place of our singles congregation, which we're thankful for and they minister to us and we hope they minister to them.
[time=1114] But throughout time the church has been strong because of strong families.
[time=1118] And at the core of that family unit is this relationship between a husband and a wife, and so we believe it to be central to our church, central to our homes and central to life itself.
[time=1132] My expectations in this little series is really, I'm figuring that some good marriages are going to get better, some marriages that are stuck are going to get moving again, and some marriages that are near death might just be revived and be brought back to life.
[time=1151] And in the three years that I have been here and in the ten years of ministry prior to my coming here and the counseling and the exposure behind closed doors to a great number of marriages, as well as what I learned from my own, a lot of marriages are in the latter two categories, stuck and needing to get moving and near death and in vital need of being revived.
[time=1176] Let me explain my target this morning and really through the series.
[time=1180] I want to talk about good people who have come to marriage with good intentions,
[time=1190] who through the course of time have made valiant efforts in their marriage relationship.
[time=1196] But at one point or another, they have settled for second best.
[time=1204] Good people, by that I mean people who are born again, people who are regenerate, people who love Christ, people who honor Christ, people who study and desire to bring the truth of his word into their life.
[time=1216] Good people with good intentions, people who came to the altar there
[time=1222] with the highest of hopes and the highest of expectations and the best of intentions to really build a marriage that would honor God and that would really build a marriage that would provide fruit and joy in the thrill of what God might have intended in marriage.
[time=1238] And who after that solemn vow may have made a number of valiant efforts through time,
[time=1244] maybe even in the first several months, maybe as that thing developed through years 4, 5, and 6, and up to year 10 and 25 and 30 and 50, valiant efforts have been made.
[time=1254] But somewhere along the line, the decision has been made just to settle for second best
[time=1262] in the area of marriage.
[time=1265] Let me define what I mean by second best.
[time=1269] And you might want to write this down if you're one who takes notes.
[time=1273] Second best is a managed moral coexistence,
[time=1281] a managed moral coexistence.
[time=1284] Marriage for these people has become second best defined as a managed moral coexistence.
[time=1294] I'm going to contrast that this morning with what I think is God's best.
[time=1299] And that's this. You might write this down as well.
[time=1302] The passionate or a passionate, vulnerable mutual pursuit.
[time=1312] A passionate, vulnerable mutual pursuit.
[time=1317] And about this time, you're saying to yourself, "Dear Lord, help the preacher," right?
[time=1322] Because this makes no sense to you whatsoever.
[time=1325] And that means I have you right where I want you, because I'm going to spend the rest of the morning talking about those two things.
[time=1331] What is a managed moral coexistence?
[time=1335] By moral, I mean this.
[time=1338] The marriage relationship is basically occurring within moral boundaries as they are defined in the word of God.
[time=1344] There's no adultery, there's no physical abuse, there's no verbal abuse.
[time=1350] In fact, these couples are basically trying to follow the biblical role where the husband leads and the wife follows and submits.
[time=1359] And so in that regard, it is a moral relationship.
[time=1364] We also then said that they are in a state of coexisting.
[time=1368] And what I mean by that, good people with good intentions and valiant efforts have come to points of great conflict in their relationships, in their relationship over time.
[time=1378] Great points of conflict, and they do not know how to resolve that conflict.
[time=1383] They get into fights to put it in the vernacular of our day.
[time=1386] And so they start off wanting to be like this.
[time=1389] And somewhere along the line, they run into their first fight and they feel like there's walls going up in their relationship.
[time=1394] And they don't really know how to work through those things.
[time=1399] And they make an effort, and maybe they say they're sorry, but they only get halfway back.
[time=1406] And a little bit later, they run into another problem, another fight, another concern.
[time=1411] And they explode outward again, and walls feel like they've gone up higher and further this time, and they're thicker walls.
[time=1419] But because they're moral, and because they want to stay within God's boundaries, they do their best to say they're sorry,
[time=1427] but the conflict is not really resolved in healthy ways, and so they come back, but now they're only back to here.
[time=1434] And it happens again, and again, and again, and again, and pretty soon, what is standard fare in this relationship,
[time=1441] intimacy is compromised, and we are now coexisting at safe distances from each other.
[time=1450] I was looking in the dictionary about coexistence, it means this, to live in peace with each other, especially as a matter of policy.
[time=1461] We're married, we believe the Bible, we're not going to get unmarried.
[time=1467] However, you hurt me, and I hurt you, and we don't really know how to move back towards points of genuine intimacy again,
[time=1476] so we find ourselves coexisting, safely distanced, where we can minimize the pain,
[time=1484] and it almost becomes a matter of policy.
[time=1491] Managed. It's a managed moral coexistence. Managed, I mean by that, experience has taught you.
[time=1499] The hotspots in your relationship, the buttons that must never be pushed, the danger zones that must never be entered,
[time=1505] the weaknesses that must never be talked about, and with great skill and consistency, you manage that relationship,
[time=1516] keeping your safe distance, avoiding the pitfalls, hoping, hoping that everything will just work out.
[time=1526] Now, to be more specific, I have in mind this morning, and in my notes I have a basic description
[time=1534] of how this managed moral coexistence works in three actual couples' lives.
[time=1540] I'm happy to report that none of the people I'm talking about this morning are me and my wife, nor are they any of you.
[time=1546] It's not me and it's not you, it's people that I know out west, so you can just stop trying to figure out who I'm talking about.
[time=1553] Okay? And what I want you to do is I want you to try to envision and understand how this problem of coexistence occurs.
[time=1566] Couple number one, I'll give you his strengths and then his weaknesses, her strengths and then her weaknesses,
[time=1572] and then a characterization of their relationship.
[time=1576] He is, in his strengths category, an extrovert. He is spontaneous. He is carefree.
[time=1584] This man is a party waiting to happen.
[time=1588] The only time, in fact, he has ever turned down an invitation to a party is when he misunderstood the invitation.
[time=1597] His weaknesses, he is careless, he is unorganized, and at points just downright irresponsible.
[time=1610] She, in her strength, is organized, principle-centered, reliable, steady, could be called a plotter.
[time=1622] In her weaknesses, she becomes rigid, inflexible, basically only sees things in black and white and can become remarkably unforgiving.
[time=1640] Good people with good intentions, making valiant efforts settle for second best, because when those two types of people collide and explode into the painful distance as they've deeply hurt each other,
[time=1653] and they don't know how to get back, they eventually find a place that's safe enough called coexistence, and that becomes their life.
[time=1666] I would characterize their relationship this way, and I know this to be a fact.
[time=1671] This particular couple is only together. They are only still married to this day because of a deep, pervasive conviction in each of their hearts that this is the word of God, and they do not have grounds for divorce.
[time=1686] That is why they are together at this moment.
[time=1690] They do haphazardly experience happy times in their coexistence because they have some fruit of labor gone by as they invested in their children,
[time=1701] and as they have been successful in the marketplace, there are some in their coexistence some happy times, I call them happy times because it should sound appropriately trite.
[time=1714] But there is an inverse, but exponentially explosive moment and moments of bitterness and anger marked by biting, life scarring words which will never be forgotten.
[time=1734] And the intimacy factor in their life is almost non-existent.
[time=1741] That's what I mean by a managed, moral, co-existent.
[time=1748] Beyond the harsh words that they from time to time, not as a regular thing, but when they just can't hold it back anymore in a weak moment,
[time=1755] beyond those explosive verbal times which are clearly sin, basically the relationship is a moral one, but they are imprisoned in a state of coexistence.
[time=1768] Couple number two, this particular individual is in the ministry. His strengths, very high energy, very goal oriented, unusually talented, and as you might expect an overachiever.
[time=1783] His weaknesses, he refuses to acknowledge his emotions.
[time=1791] With my own ears, heard the individual say in a situation that in my opinion and most others should have devastated him and brought him to the place as Christ was often to the point of tears as his sorrow and his compassion for the situation and the tragedy that occurred.
[time=1810] And as I questioned, where are your emotions? He said to me, emotions roll off my back like water off a duck's back and didn't even realize what an embarrassing confession that actually was.
[time=1830] In the call of duty, this man politely steps on people. Whatever it takes to keep the ministry moving, if people are in the way, those people are politely.
[time=1844] But they're not honored, they're not respected, they're just removed. This individual is entirely self-absorbed to the point that he rarely, if ever, asks another person this simple question, how are you doing?
[time=1863] And then waits earnestly for the response, hoping then to draw further things out of this individual. It just doesn't happen.
[time=1878] How would you like to be married to that, ladies? She, on the other hand, is bright and caring and faithful and loyal.
[time=1893] Her weak sides are she can become very defensive, very controlling and reclusive, withdrawing back and tell she only has a very, very, and I mean very, maybe one or two people beyond her immediate family that she even lets into her life.
[time=1915] Good people with good intentions having made valiant efforts, somewhere they settled for a second best called moral coexistence. Their relationship can be characterized this way.
[time=1925] They are prone to communication impasses that are never really dealt with. In other words, when major problems come up, they have a communication impasse and those problems are never really dealt with.
[time=1939] He just retreats to his work and she retreats to raising her children.
[time=1948] Despite the enormous distance between them, they keep telling each other that they have a good marriage.
[time=1957] They're forced to tell this to each other over and over and over again and they say that it's good because it's moral, because their kids are doing well, because they've been faithful to do the Lord's work,
[time=1967] because in a behavioral vantage point, they have kept the law.
[time=1975] But there is a deep seated mutual disappointment that each one has in their heart towards the other about the painful absence of genuine intimacy.
[time=1989] They are dealt with through an open, vulnerable communication and soul bearing. Instead, these feelings are pushed aside as they continue to respond to the bugle call of duty.
[time=2001] In fact, this particular couple has been known to read biographies of other great Christians.
[time=2007] And in those biographies, they will find the weak and undernourished and feeble condition of marriages inside those people that God may have used despite the weakness of their marriage
[time=2018] take consolation in the weakness of those other people's marriages and begin to say that just must be normative for people in the ministry.
[time=2028] They work hard at denying the reality of the thin facade, the intimacy factor in their marriage.
[time=2037] They have very little of it on their own. In other words, there's very little that's going on between these two people that could draw them or could be considered or could constitute genuine intimacy.
[time=2047] The connectedness that they do feel and the closeness at times that they do feel is typically their commiseration together in the response to people not appreciating their ministry.
[time=2060] They feel attacked. And so they defend each other and call it intimacy.
[time=2069] Nothing but a managed moral co-existence.
[time=2076] The third couple, his strengths, this individual is an eternal optimist.
[time=2083] I mean, unbelievable gift of optimism. If you're ever down, give this guy a call.
[time=2089] He is remarkably talented, easygoing, and I consider him a social genius.
[time=2095] This individual can move in and out of social settings with more poise and more skill and more ease than anybody I know, and he really enjoys doing it.
[time=2109] But his weaknesses are these. He is remarkably superficial.
[time=2114] Because of his superficial view of life and of relationships, he is prone to poor judgment and at times being irresponsibly naive.
[time=2124] In other words, things that he should notice and take action of, he doesn't even see.
[time=2131] His wife is a creative, thoughtful, sincere, and sensitive woman.
[time=2138] Her weaknesses constitute a dark and brooding nature.
[time=2142] She can fall into self-preoccupation and discouragement that can totally immobilize her from her Christian duties and responsibilities.
[time=2153] And in her inactivity, she feels absolutely justified because she is so preoccupied.
[time=2161] To characterize their relationship, it is a remarkably, and I don't know if this is a word or not, surfacey relationship.
[time=2169] The two of them operate way, way, way up here at the surface.
[time=2175] Their joy and their point of connection is found in mutually satisfying events.
[time=2183] In other words, they like to go to movies, and they would like to go to movies by themselves, and since that's true, they like going with each other.
[time=2191] They like a good meal, and they may as well enjoy that together.
[time=2196] They enjoy doing projects around the house. They enjoy the raising of their children.
[time=2202] Their connectedness and their joy isn't about their relationship.
[time=2207] It just so happens that they enjoy some common activities, and so their connectedness comes around a mutual appreciation for common activities, not each other.
[time=2219] At points, feeling completely missed by her husband.
[time=2224] She can slump into self-preoccupation and discouragement, which he notices only because she doesn't seem as up for the next movie, or the next meal, or the next fun time.
[time=2239] He thinks the solution is to find more interesting activities.
[time=2246] Intimacy? What's the intimacy factor in their marriage? It's almost non-existent.
[time=2252] She never feels understood or genuinely pursued.
[time=2259] So that's what I mean. I hope that puts some flesh on the bones of a clumsy statement called managed moral coexistence.
[time=2271] Genesis chapter 2. Let's move in our thinking to a passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit.
[time=2281] In Genesis chapter 2 verses 24 and 25, we read this.
[time=2285] "For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.
[time=2292] And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed."
[time=2301] That little phrase, "naked and not ashamed," is not simply referring to the fact that Adam and Eve didn't have any clothes on, which happens to be true.
[time=2310] They were naked in every aspect of their relationship to each other.
[time=2314] They were vulnerable to each other. They were exposed to each other.
[time=2320] Obviously, prayer to the fall, which is when this verse is written. The fall doesn't come to chapter 3.
[time=2327] Neither of them has any sin, and so neither of them has anything to hide.
[time=2332] They can stand total exposure.
[time=2336] There's nothing for them to be guilty about. There's nothing for them to feel contempt. There's nothing for them to feel shameful of.
[time=2341] There's nothing for them to fear rejection over in their life. They're just perfect.
[time=2346] And to add to that, they are looking in the eyes of another perfect person who has the capacity to love them perfectly.
[time=2357] So that even if there was a fault, this other person, being perfect, would love them perfectly.
[time=2364] Would absorb the shame and the guilt. Would bear under that burden.
[time=2372] So we see here being described a passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit where they could stand in each other's presence naked and without shame.
[time=2389] I want to say this to you.
[time=2392] And this is what I would say to the singles in our midst as well.
[time=2395] What we're talking about here as far as a passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit does not have to be confined to marriage.
[time=2403] It is, in fact, the very essence of our Christian experience.
[time=2408] Do you realize that our Christian experience is not about behaving obediently to God in an external sense?
[time=2416] That is not the sum total of our Christian experience.
[time=2421] The core and the central reality of what it means to be saved is to be in the process of a passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit.
[time=2435] That is the beginning and the end of what it means to be saved.
[time=2438] And I can hear and feel the skepticism to that statement and cut it with a knife.
[time=2444] Well, come with me to the New Testament, 1 Peter chapter 1. Let me back that up.
[time=2459] In 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 22, there is a remarkable statement that distills what I just said into a simple verse.
[time=2466] And the Word of God is so capable of being poignant and clear and simple and true.
[time=2473] In 1 Peter 1, 22, it says this, "Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren, fervently love one another from the heart."
[time=2488] Let's back up and think about that for a minute.
[time=2490] That first phrase, "Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls," when did that happen?
[time=2495] When is it that a person purifies their souls and obedience to the truth or because of their obedience to the truth, their souls are purified?
[time=2502] It's called salvation, folks.
[time=2504] When you come to Christ, you in obedience to the truth have purified your souls or God purifies your soul for you.
[time=2513] So, go back again, verse 22.
[time=2516] "Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls," the question is why did you purify your soul?
[time=2521] What was salvation supposed to lead to?
[time=2523] It's right there.
[time=2524] For a sincere love of the brethren.
[time=2529] You're telling me then that I got saved so that I could be in the passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit of other brethren.
[time=2537] Yes.
[time=2539] Now, obviously, we know that ultimately our salvation is for the glory of God.
[time=2543] But we even understand that what God wants from us, and in John 17, 3, he says this is eternal life, that you may know me.
[time=2555] Relationship.
[time=2559] And then on the horizontal level of our lives, the only reason for which we've been redeemed is to be in the passionate, sincere love of the brethren.
[time=2569] So look at the end of the verse.
[time=2571] If that's why you got saved, the obvious conclusion, fervently love one another from the heart.
[time=2578] My friends, this is screaming out that a moral coexistence is second best.
[time=2587] This is screaming out to us that marriage and in fact relationships in general were never meant to be lived at a safe distance
[time=2596] where liabilities can be properly managed and potholes can be avoided and danger zones can be stayed out of.
[time=2604] This is talking about fervent. That's another word for passionate, isn't it?
[time=2609] Love.
[time=2611] That's another word for being vulnerable when Christ loved us.
[time=2615] He became very vulnerable.
[time=2622] Mutual fervently love one another from the heart.
[time=2631] What this is talking about is that there is something in the process of being born again whereby we should be so gripped at the basic core level of our existence
[time=2641] that we are compelled to love fervently from the heart.
[time=2649] That's why I don't buy the honey do lists, and you may use those and we can talk about that in the future.
[time=2656] That's why I don't think marriage relationships are about managing your honey do list or how many times you bring flowers or how many date nights you go on
[time=2663] or how many weekends away you've been or how many anniversaries you've observed and how spectacularly or the birthdays
[time=2669] or the presence because it's not about what you are doing so much.
[time=2672] It's about who you are and the passion and the direction of your soul that is fervently loving your spouse.
[time=2682] And sure, you may end up doing a lot of the things on that list, but doing the things on that list don't constitute love.
[time=2692] The last thing I want to do is to be loved by somebody according to my own predetermined list.
[time=2698] That's pretty boring stuff. This is how I want you to love me here. Just do this, okay?
[time=2703] What I'm longing for is someone who brings the creative capacity of what it means to be created in the image of God, the energy inside their soul,
[time=2710] their volitional capacities, their ability to think, their ability to get to know me and understand me, my strengths, my weaknesses, my accomplishments and my failures, and then to creatively move into my life
[time=2723] and grip me with their fervent, passionate, vulnerable love.
[time=2727] And as they do, they become exposed that I may not treat them the way they deserve to be treated even as they pursue me.
[time=2734] And it may hurt that other person, but they love me so much they pursue me anyway.
[time=2747] Passionate, something deep within you, the energy within your soul.
[time=2752] It's what the Lord said, that we should love him with all of our heart and all of our soul and all of our mind and all of our strength.
[time=2759] That's what he says when he wants your love.
[time=2764] The Ten Commandments are a list, but they are just representative of what it means to love God.
[time=2770] And you know as well as I know, listkeeping goes nowhere with God.
[time=2774] Vulnerable, I looked that up this morning as I was just putting finishing touches on this.
[time=2779] I'll give you the three definitions of the word vulnerable out of your basic dictionary.
[time=2782] Capable of being physically wounded, in the context of marriage we could broaden that a little bit.
[time=2789] Capable of being physically, emotionally and spiritually and relationally wounded.
[time=2794] When I become vulnerable to you, I put myself in a position where you can hurt me.
[time=2800] The second definition, open to attack or damage.
[time=2805] When I become vulnerable in my love of you, I open myself up for attack and damage.
[time=2810] And if you don't think so, just ask Christ who left the safety of heaven to become vulnerable in his love for us.
[time=2815] And he did suffer attack and damage all the way to the point of death.
[time=2821] The third definition I like the most, even though I don't fully understand it.
[time=2824] Listen to this.
[time=2826] Vulnerable, liable to increased penalties, but entitled to increased bonuses after winning a game in contract bridge.
[time=2839] So in other words, inside this thing called bridge, you can do a thing that's called, I guess, vulnerable.
[time=2846] Like what do you say to your partner? We're going to be vulnerable now.
[time=2848] And you play it a certain way.
[time=2851] And if you lose, you are suspect to extraordinary pain and penalty.
[time=2859] But if you win, if you win, you're open to extraordinary bonuses.
[time=2868] And I believe that's true.
[time=2871] When you move out of a co-existing relationship, a moral, a managed co-existence, and you move into this mutual pursuit thing of passionate vulnerability,
[time=2883] you put yourself out there where you indeed can be hurt in ways you would never be hurt in co-existence.
[time=2890] But where you can know the joy and the thrill and the thirst quenching reality of soul oneness, which, by the way, is what we were created to experience.
[time=2900] And the only thing that's worth living for.
[time=2908] We're not talking about peace.
[time=2910] We're not talking about damage control.
[time=2912] We're not talking about keeping a safe distance. We're not talking about staying away from sensitive issues. We're talking about a passionate, vulnerable mutual pursuit.
[time=2923] Let me wrap this up this morning by giving you two litmus tests.
[time=2928] Try to be practical here.
[time=2931] If you don't already know which category you're in, I think by the time you've applied these two litmus tests, things to your marriage you will.
[time=2938] Before I share them with you, let me say two things.
[time=2941] Number one, do not take what I am saying and load it into your gun.
[time=2952] And when you walk out that door, shoot it at your spouse.
[time=2957] That is out of bounds.
[time=2962] That is ungodly, that is unloving, that is selfish, and that is out of bounds.
[time=2968] Your commitment to be in vulnerable pursuit of your spouse can start the minute you get up today.
[time=2975] And part of that may include not saying the way you want to, with the chorus of a thousand angels, I told you so.
[time=2985] And where do I buy a copy of that tape?
[time=2989] Okay, that is out of bounds. That is absolutely out of bounds.
[time=2998] I forgot the second thing I want to say, maybe it'll come in a minute.
[time=3001] Litmus test number one, revolves around this word communication.
[time=3007] Communication, I'm going to give you two little things under communication.
[time=3010] Litmus test number one, communication.
[time=3013] If you want to know if you're in a managed moral coexistence or a passionate vulnerable mutual pursuit, which one you're in, here's a way to find out.
[time=3021] Your relationship will be marked by deepening levels of communication, which is supported by deepening levels of trust, understanding, and acceptance.
[time=3033] In other words, through the course of time, you and your spouse find that you can now talk more deeply
[time=3042] and more personally about the things that really matter in your relationship with God, in your relationship with each other, how you're doing with the kids, how we're handling the finances, what we're doing with our free time, the personal little problems that bother.
[time=3055] You can talk more freely and more openly about that stuff at deeper levels because there is a higher level of trust that when you look into the eyes of your spouse
[time=3068] and you're about to say things that may not be popular, may be misunderstood, or may just be downright ugly about you, you have a higher level of trust in that person's acceptance and understanding of who you are.
[time=3083] The second part under communication will be revealed and will show up in your physical intimacy.
[time=3094] And now everybody's starting to sweat, including me.
[time=3097] We're talking about sexual freedom and expression here.
[time=3102] And what I'm trying to say is this, when there is a passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit in the relationship outside of the bedroom,
[time=3117] you will find that that same stuff, listen to it again in the context of a bedroom, passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit, you will find it shows up in your bedroom.
[time=3137] And if you're out there today saying to yourself, "Gee whiz, where did the passion in our sex life go?"
[time=3145] I'll tell you where it went.
[time=3147] It went the same route as the passionate intimacy of your day-to-day relationship.
[time=3156] It's out here.
[time=3158] And maybe certain functions get performed, and maybe certain duties get followed, but you're a million miles away from a passionate, vulnerable, mutual pursuit.
[time=3178] The second litmus test comes into the word commitment.
[time=3183] Commitment.
[time=3185] You will find that you are experiencing deeper levels of commitment to your spouse, not for the sake of the kids, not for the sake of financial considerations, not out of duty, not because you're too old to start over again with somebody else.
[time=3201] You will find a deepening level of commitment in your relationship because you have tasted the delightful thirst quenching excitement of soul oneness, and you simply can't live without it.
[time=3215] You just won't settle for anything else.
[time=3218] And so your commitment level begins to go up notch after notch after notch, and as obstacles come to this mutual pursuit, because you've tasted it before, you fight for it.
[time=3230] You fight for it with all your worth.
[time=3237] And secondly, and most importantly, your commitment will deepen, because you know that when you are not pursuing soul oneness, when you are not in either the point of pursuing or enjoying this product of soul oneness, you know that it leaves your spouse in a painful state of isolation.
[time=3259] And you just care too much about your spouse to let any other interest, whether it's your work or your hobbies or your other friendships, whatever it is, nothing can matter enough to you to overcome the enormous burden that you carry on your heart all day long, knowing that your spouse is in a state of isolation and loneliness.
[time=3288] Because your relationship at that moment is not marked by mutual pursuit, and you refuse to let her live another moment in that condition.
[time=3313] For many of you, isolation and walls and unresolved conflict and diminishing intimacy has been a way of life.
[time=3323] It's just standard fare.
[time=3327] You've been hanging on to a mere modicum of the truth in God's word, and maybe it could be enough today, and I am going to ask you to talk about this as couples, and I am going to ask the men to be men and to lead the discussion, but in a very gentle way.
[time=3344] And say, honey, where do you find us? I mean, how are we doing on these litmus tests and what is where? And the second thing I was going to say, by the way, that I forgot that I now remember, is you know, you can move in and out of these two categories like in a heartbeat.
[time=3360] You can be on the path of mutual pursuit one minute, and then suddenly you can just shift into coexistence.
[time=3369] So it's not as if we're entrenched and calcified forever in these states of existence.
[time=3374] But maybe a beginning point would be for you as couples to talk about this, and if you have been characterized by coexistence, to just confess it to each other, and not try to solve it, and not try to work it all out today.
[time=3389] And just say, you know, he's right. He's talking about us, and then just plead with God.
[time=3397] God, show us out. Show us the way out. And maybe in the weeks to come, we can whet your appetite for some more things, and God will be honored.
[time=3412] What a delight to serve a risen Savior, and what a privilege it is to come into your home with the Bible hour today.

[time=3439] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that you could come to me today, and to reveal the sin that's in my life,
