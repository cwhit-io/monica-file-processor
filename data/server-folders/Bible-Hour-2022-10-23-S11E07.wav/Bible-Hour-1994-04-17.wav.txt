[time=0] There was a point in our lives when all we could think about was this woman.
[time=8] And we had surveyed the landscape and we had looked at all the alternatives.
[time=14] And we believe that this one woman was the one that was absolutely essential to our future.
[time=20] She was the new vista.
[time=22] She was the direction we simply had to go.
[time=25] She was the direction we couldn't live without.
[time=27] And it was obvious, and we worked hard at communicating this reality to her by being creative
[time=35] in the way we spoke with her and related with her and we called her and we sent her cards and we bought her flowers and money was no object and we took her places and we rearranged our schedule so that we could meet her needs and be with her.
[time=47] Not out of a sense of duty, but because we were convinced somewhere deep down inside that this person was essential and vital and the new vista in our future.
[time=64] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope
[time=77] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=79] Thank you for joining us.
[time=81] As we continue in our series on marriage, Pastor Moore profiles the kind of husband who gives hope to his wife.
[time=88] Now, this is the husband who understands his wife and expresses his love in meaningful ways that makes a difference in their lives.
[time=96] All too often the way husbands relate to their wives has the opposite effect and the relationship seems doomed to an unsatisfied compromise of her deepest longings.
[time=106] More special music today will be presented by Reflection and by Read La Favor.
[time=119] Let's join Reflection as they begin our service.

[time=410] Now let's return to our service.
[time=440] Our life is time for life is time, For what I'm meant, our body did. Where could I be,
[time=453] Jesus didn't love me? Where would I be, Jesus didn't care? Where would I be, He had the sacrifice,
[time=467] Oh, and then, our body did, So glad we did, So glad we did, But then, there's money for
[time=484] me, And the power of my body did, So glad we did, And the power of my body did,
[time=498] And the power of my body did, I don't know why Jesus loved me, I don't know why He
[time=514] said, Oh, and then, so glad He did, And the power of my body did, So glad we did,
[time=529] And the power of my body did, And the power of my body did, And the power of my body did,
[time=546] Oh, and then, our body did, I don't know why Jesus loved me, I don't know why He did,
[time=565] I don't know why He said, Oh, and then, I'm glad He did, I don't know why He said,
[time=580] Oh, and then, oh, and then, Oh, and then, So glad we did, So glad we did,
[time=599] So glad we did, Yeah, so glad we did, Yeah, so glad we did, Yeah, so glad.
[time=629] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour to date.
[time=631] Let me just take a minute and tell you about three very important dates.
[time=635] The first one is May 19th, a Thursday evening, where we will be hosting Ray Bolts in concert.
[time=641] Those tickets are available at local bookstores.
[time=644] And then on June 19th, we'll have the premiere performance of a new recording by Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=650] And then finally, on July 3rd, our annual Patriotic Panorama.
[time=655] Please note those dates, we'll tell you more about them in coming weeks, and I hope you'll join with us for some exciting concerts coming up here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=689] And that sin swept ill became the open door to paradise, because you prayed so hard.
[time=719] You prayed much to hire a price for me, your tears, your blood in the pain.
[time=743] You have my soul just stirred at times, yet never truly changed.
[time=755] You deserve a fiery love that won't ignore your sacrifice because you paid much to hire
[time=775] your grace inspires my heart to rise above the sin.
[time=803] And all the earthly vanities that seeks to draw me, Oh, I want to tell this jaded world
[time=821] of love that truly saved my life, of a love that paid so high a price.
[time=842] You prayed much to hire a price for me, your tears, your blood in the pain.
[time=858] You have my soul just stirred at times, yet never truly changed.
[time=871] You deserve a fiery love that won't ignore your sacrifice because you paid much to hire
[time=897] your grace.
[time=901] There is a fountain filled with blood drawn from e-menual space, and sinners plunged
[time=922] with evil fat blood lose all of your hands and their soul.
[time=939] You deserve a fiery love that won't ignore your sacrifice because you paid much to hire
[time=949] a price because you paid much to hire a price.
[time=969] You deserve a fiery love that won't ignore your sacrifice because you paid much to hire
[time=983] your grace.
[time=986] You deserve a fiery love that won't ignore your sacrifice because you paid much to hire your grace.
[time=993] Wonderful, Reid, thank you, and so true.
[time=1005] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bibles and turn to Ephesians chapter 5.
[time=1012] For those of you who were not with us last week, we began a series on marriage, and my
[time=1018] apologies if this morning you're a little bit lost.
[time=1021] We're going to build in some ways upon the foundation that we laid last week.
[time=1026] If you'd like to get a copy of that tape, you can call our church receptionist and she'll
[time=1032] make one for you and send it to you.
[time=1035] Nobody makes any money on that, but if you want to just kind of fill in your thinking as we go, we'd be happy for you to have that information.
[time=1043] This morning I want to talk to the men in our group, the husbands in our group, the men who by God's grace would someday in the future become husbands, and I'm going to ask you
[time=1054] to think about your life a little bit this morning, ask you to think about what's important to you, what's your striving after, and I, in my study this week as I just remembered
[time=1066] and reminded myself of the New Testament and its counsel to men in relationship with women,
[time=1072] the husband and wife relationship.
[time=1074] It seems to me that the whole counsel can be boiled down into one basic phrase, and it's
[time=1081] this, love your wife in an understanding way.
[time=1086] Love your wife in an understanding way, and I want to just break that into two basic points.
[time=1091] Love your wife, point one, and then secondly in an understanding way.
[time=1096] And I trust the Spirit of God will challenge you this morning and open your heart and your mind to some of these thoughts, and I want to jump in there with you.
[time=1104] And I want you to know that as I share these things, I just find myself continually needing
[time=1110] to grow, and I want to grow, and so please open your heart to God's word as I'm going
[time=1116] to try to do the same thing and try not to be defensive, but really allow the Spirit of God to touch your heart.
[time=1123] As we get going here, maybe you could imagine something, first of all, that in your job, whatever you do for a living, that you get a phone call from maybe a major competitor,
[time=1135] or someone who is in a position to really escalate your career.
[time=1142] And they say to you, this individual, the president of this other company, says, you know, we really believe there's a trend coming, and there's this new horizon in our industry,
[time=1153] and we must do whatever it takes to capture that and to penetrate that new horizon.
[time=1161] And we've been doing a rather comprehensive search of the man we want to head that division up for us, and we really believe it's you.
[time=1171] We've looked at over a hundred different individuals carefully, but we believe that you are the unique individual who can take us into this new dimension, this new horizon with excellence
[time=1181] and purpose and success.
[time=1184] And so the courtship goes on between you and this individual, and he doesn't just do this over the phone, he shows up in the company jet and takes you out to dinner and your family out to dinner, and there's all kinds of things and offers are being made, and the terms of your employment are being laid out, and the thing that's most enticing to you isn't so much how they're going to pay you or how much they're going to pay you, stock options that might come your way.
[time=1205] What's most intriguing to you is you sense that you are going to have the opportunity to
[time=1211] play an intricate role, a vital role in the development of a vital area, maybe the priority
[time=1218] area of this company.
[time=1220] And as a result, there's going to be a communication link between you and the president, there's going to be necessary funding, there's going to be a prioritizing on your requests, there's going to be an experience of kind of entrepreneuring together into new horizons, it just challenges
[time=1234] you to the core of what you are.
[time=1236] You want to do this.
[time=1238] The money's a secondary issue, and so this individual finally convinces you that that's
[time=1246] really what's going to happen, and of course there's in any business situation, you can't promise that it'll all work out the right way, but you really sense that's what's in his heart at least at this moment, and so you leave, give notice, and you move into this new venture,
[time=1261] and it starts just as it was promised.
[time=1264] You are the new vice president of this area, and you do have a vital communication link, and the company really is beginning to change and direct its resources in this particular area, and it's just an unbelievable dream come true.
[time=1278] And things are going relatively well, you're performing, you're doing what would be expected of you.
[time=1286] Six months into the project, twelve months into the project, eighteen months into the project, but suddenly, and very subtly though, at first there's a shift going on, and you
[time=1295] begin to notice that your connection with the president is becoming a little more distant, and you don't know what you did to bring this about, it's just he's not as quite available, he doesn't stop by as often, the phone calls don't come in, the excitement isn't in his voice, and then you start to realize that the necessary funding to keep going into some
[time=1313] of these new areas isn't there, it's beginning to decrease, the prioritizing of your request
[time=1320] is beginning to drop off, suddenly it dawns on you, the president isn't around as much anymore.
[time=1326] In fact, he's decided that the particular area he invited you to is no longer the strategic
[time=1332] one, it's important you're going to keep your job, you get to stay on, things are going to go relatively well, but it's no longer the priority.
[time=1342] And now, he's off courting somebody else for some new division, and you suddenly realize
[time=1351] that you're just kind of one of the guys, you're just being maintained like any of the other divisions, a lot like where you were before, how's that feel, that's okay I know
[time=1364] because that's business and you can't make promises like that in business, but how does that impact you, how would that strike you, well just roll the clock back a little bit
[time=1376] on your relationship with your wife and recognize that for her in about 95% of our cases, she
[time=1387] lives that scenario, that's her whole life, suddenly somebody approached her and says you know, I'm really trying to move into a new area, it's called marriage, and I want
[time=1398] to over the landscape, and I believe that you are the unique one, you're the only one
[time=1405] that can take us where we desperately need to go, and I want to assure you of my personal presence, my personal commitment, your request will become priorities, you're going to have the necessary funding, you're going to have whatever it takes, he says to you in a thousand, or excuse me, you said to her in a thousand different ways, as you changed your schedule, as you spent money, as you were creative in your dates, as you did all the things that typically occur inside of courtship, and eventually you got to the point of a wedding
[time=1435] day and a honeymoon, and the only thing that convinced her in the first place to move wasn't
[time=1442] the amount of money, or the amount of time, or the creativity you expressed, that she was looking past all that stuff into the recesses of your heart, trying to figure out does he really want me, what does this guy really after, and somehow or another you were able
[time=1457] to convince her that you are after who she is as a person, that was the essential thing,
[time=1466] and of course with marriage it's much much different than a business arrangement, you made certain promises in private to her and in public, in your vows, and as you understand from the Word of God, that she would remain as long as you're alive, the central passion
[time=1483] and focus of your life, saving of course your relationship with God and we understand God
[time=1489] would have us express our passion for Him in holding her as that priority in her hearts.
[time=1497] And then you got married, came home from the honeymoon, things went kind of okay this first
[time=1503] six, the first twelve, the first eighteen months, but suddenly, but very subtly, she began to recognize a shift in your heart. Suddenly, you weren't as available to her. Suddenly,
[time=1519] the communication link began to fall apart. Suddenly, she was perceiving that she was
[time=1527] just one among many things that you were doing and in fact, she become kind of on the maintenance
[time=1534] side of things, maybe on the back burner and now, she was your real heart and your real
[time=1540] passion and your real energy and your real vision was way past her. In other words, just
[time=1551] about the time you had convinced her that she was going to be the passion of your life and you married her. She's just like, if you will, jumping up onto the couch there with some popcorn and a soda and she's just ready to watch this wonderfully romantic movie of
[time=1567] your love unfolding in her life and she's figuring this is going to be like a long movie, like an epic type movie. It's going to go on the rest of her life and it's just going to be one scene after the next of how your love is unfolding in her life. Just about the time she gets comfortable and focused, you get up and change the channel and you're
[time=1586] saying, aren't there any sports on? Isn't there some, isn't there a good blood and guts
[time=1592] movie we can watch? What is this romance stuff? How about CNN? What's going on in Bosnia?
[time=1600] How are the stocks doing? What? And of course, I guess that actually happens in real life,
[time=1607] doesn't it? When we're selecting our television shows. In other words, in the male mind, we
[time=1616] subtly, and I don't even think we recognize we're saying this, we somehow say to ourselves, well, we got the marriage job done. What's next? I court her, I romanced her, I convinced
[time=1628] her, I married her. Okay, we'll check that off. Now what am I? Oh, I got to get a career.
[time=1633] Okay, and I got to make a living and I got to do this and I got to do that. So that becomes our new passion. That becomes our new focus. And many of us were raised in our homes to
[time=1645] be men, which translates never wine, work hard, and win at all costs. Whatever the next objective
[time=1654] is, you must simply conquer it. And in your mind, you didn't mean to desert her. And in your heart, you didn't mean to leave her or to stop trying to provide for her. But it's
[time=1666] clear to her that you're moving on. You have moved on. It's no longer her division. That's
[time=1672] the principal one, the critical one, the new one, the fascinating one. And she picks it up in your conversation and she picks it up in your schedule and she picks it up in the way you spend your money. She picks it up in the things you're excited about. She picks it up in the way that the friends you keep. And what we're doing at this point, guys,
[time=1694] is we are violating. We are violating not just our wife, okay? We are violating the divine order that God has set in place for husband and wives. We are absolutely violating the
[time=1710] way God intends for it to work. And in the process, we are systematically dismantling
[time=1716] the emotional, equilibrium, and self-esteem of our wives. Systematically, dismantling
[time=1724] the emotional, equilibrium, and self-esteem of our wives.
[time=1731] When we get up and change the channel, it may just seem like a new pursuit to us and a reasonable one at that and maybe a necessary one because a lot of these things do have to be done. But to her, it's absolutely earth shattering. It's her worst nightmare coming
[time=1748] true. She becomes, to draw the conclusion, you know what? He never really wanted me.
[time=1758] All he wanted was a wife. All he was ever after in the first place was a thing called
[time=1767] a wife that's supposed to do certain things in the home and in the relationship with the
[time=1773] husband and in life. Well, okay, I got that category settled. Now that's up and running.
[time=1777] Okay, now what am I after? Well, here's what happens inside your wife as you start dismantling
[time=1792] her emotional well-being. And as I start dismantling my wife's emotional disbe, well-being. Imagine
[time=1802] if you will, dreaming all your life as a man, training hard, schooling, mentoring, and then
[time=1808] making your best effort to do the thing you always wanted to do. And you finally come to
[time=1814] that moment where you're fully qualified and you get the opportunity and the message comes back, you're just not enough. You're just not good enough. You're just not enough. And
[time=1828] so over and over and over again, despite your redoubling of efforts, you get the message.
[time=1832] You're just not enough. And what she's getting from you as your heart continues to de-treasure
[time=1839] her and move into other areas, she gets this constant message, I'm just not enough to
[time=1846] captivate this man's heart. I'm just not enough. So she redoubles or she refigures out ways
[time=1856] or she tries different avenues, but with each effort, she finds that the pain inside of
[time=1862] her own heart quadruples as the message comes back again. Oh, he enjoyed that moment, but
[time=1869] I mean, I was able to distract him, but he's still moving another way. He's still moving
[time=1877] past me. He's still connected to something else. That hurts. That's devastating. That's
[time=1886] painful. And when people get in pain, their defense mechanisms take over. And that's
[time=1892] what happens inside your wife. She starts defending herself. She starts making sure
[time=1898] that, well, if this, okay, okay, if this is how this is going to work, if I'm not really
[time=1904] going to be treasured, if I'm not really going to be pursued the way I was designed to be
[time=1910] pursued, I, okay. And so the distancing process starts and she starts to protect herself.
[time=1919] Maybe she distracts herself with other things and tries to convince herself that she can fill that longing inside of her heart with a career or with kids or with some type of
[time=1928] service that she might plug into. Maybe she gets ahold of some Christian teaching that says that you're absolutely, totally sufficient in Christ. And as long as you have Christ, you have everything you need. And so she says to herself, over and over and over again, it doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt. Because I have Jesus. I have Jesus. I have Jesus. I have Jesus. And so she finds the only way to make it through the day is either just to completely
[time=1952] distance herself from you, distract herself with something else, or try to brainwash herself. And it doesn't really hurt that you're not loving her the way you were designed to love her and the way that she was designed to receive your love. And some of that works
[time=1968] in a coexistence way. You can be functional like that. I mean, she can do her duties and you can do your duties. And it doesn't mean you have to have erupting violent fights every night when you come home. You can just settle in to a very depreciated but functioning coexistence.
[time=1985] But here's what happens and here's what you can't escape. As she continues to do that,
[time=1991] her person and her capacity to relate to people, that's what we are as people. We are a capacity
[time=1997] to relate to other people. Her person begins to shrink because she can't be consistently
[time=2005] shutting herself down and denying her emotions and convincing herself of things that are not true without doing damage to her ability to relate to God and to people. And the capacity
[time=2018] inside of her to relate begins to shrink. And that's when the vicious cycle comes into
[time=2029] place. You've gone on to greater things. She can tell it. She can feel it. She can sense
[time=2036] it. It's a violation of God's design and it's a violation of her and it hurts like a big bad dog. So she gets starting on protecting herself which diminishes her capacity to relate to you. And then you come home and want to interrelate with her. You want to connect whether you want to go somewhere or be with her in an intimate way. And suddenly you realize
[time=2057] where did she go? How come I don't feel anything from her anymore? How come the gleam is gone?
[time=2066] Or you'll just say something and she'll just boom, explode. And you throw your hands up
[time=2075] and say, "See, women, you just can't understand them." I mean, what did I say? What is her problem? Why can't she be happy? And then you start saying that to her. What is your problem? Why can't you be happy? I'm faithful, aren't I? We have a house, don't we? I spend time with you every now and then. Don't I? What is your problem? Well, that does wonders
[time=2095] for her soul. Well, that touches her deeply. And as she shrinks a little more, she withdraws
[time=2104] a little more. She resolves in her mind not to be hurt like that anymore. But as she fails
[time=2113] to give you what you're looking for, what should occur if she were soft and full and
[time=2119] vibrant with your love, what she could respond to you with, isn't there anymore? Her person
[time=2126] has shrunk and now it comes back to bite you and it hurts you in return. And you're
[time=2134] saying, "Man, this is a drag. What's happened to her?" There's just like, "Nuff, I don't."
[time=2141] And that hurts. And so you begin to distance yourself a little bit. And then you just do this to each other. It's this vicious cycle of hurting each other, failing to understand each other, failing to pursue each other in meaningful ways. So it should come to no surprise
[time=2161] to anyone. Now, look at Ephesians 5 for a minute. Look at what the Bible says the husband is supposed to do. And this should just like come out in Technicolor to you. Ephesians
[time=2171] 5, verse 25, says husbands. Husbands love your wives. Do you realize that the predominant
[time=2184] thing that God has told husbands to do is to love your wives? I mean, if you want to find the number one thing that he says most often to husbands, it's that one. Love your wives. And he puts it in a present imperative, which means don't ever stop loving your wife.
[time=2202] Now read the passage. Husbands, love your wives. Just as Christ also loved the church and gave himself up for her, that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, that he might present to himself the church and all her glory having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless. He
[time=2222] says it again, verse 28. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
[time=2228] He who loves his own wife loves himself for no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes
[time=2234] and cherishes it just as Christ also does the church because we are members of his body.
[time=2239] Now I don't understand everything that's going on in that passage. I'll just be honest with you because you're talking about Christ's love for the church and what it does in the church and it's being compared to the husband's love inside the wife. But you simply can't
[time=2254] escape the obvious conclusion that what God is calling men to do is to pursue passionately
[time=2263] their wives to love them deeply all of their lives until they have reached a place of complete
[time=2270] maturity. That's called death. That's when all that process ends. That's when we're
[time=2277] done with that pursuit. That's when that goal is completed. The other thing that stands
[time=2283] out to me in this passage is that Christ's love does something in this woman's life.
[time=2291] Christ's love does something in the life of the church and the husband's love would then do something in the life of the wife. Look at Christ's love in the church, verse 26 that
[time=2303] he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word that he might present to himself the church and all her glory having the spot or wrinkle or any such thing that she should be holy and blameless. Here's what I'm trying to say.
[time=2317] The love of Christ doesn't come back with no result. The love of Christ absolutely transforms
[time=2327] the church. It provides something for the church that allows the church to become all that the church can be. Now that's the best way to say it. I believe it's also true in
[time=2337] the marriage relationship. The love of the husband provides something in the life of
[time=2344] the wife that without that love she can never become. You understand that? Men hear that.
[time=2357] Your love is an essential ingredient in your wife becoming all that she can become. I'll
[time=2364] say it very strongly this way. Without your love she will never be able to be all that
[time=2370] she can be. And you see now, wait a minute, I thought we were sufficient in Christ and male and female, neither June or Greek, male nor female. I thought that we were totally sufficient in Christ and that Christ could meet all of our needs. No, no, it doesn't
[time=2387] work that way. Christ is not going to put on your body and your skin and live out your
[time=2393] love relationship to your wife. You're the only one on the planet who can do that. You
[time=2399] know what Christ will do for your wife when you don't do that? And she is hurting and she is in pain and she is disillusioned and she is starting to calcify. Christ will give
[time=2409] her the strength to endure that painful reality. He will not take it away. Think about that.
[time=2421] When you fail to love your wife effectively and powerfully and to penetrate your life with life-breathing power into her soul as only a husband can do to a wife. When you
[time=2433] don't do that, Christ doesn't make the difference up. Christ doesn't step in in your place.
[time=2439] Your wife hurts. Your wife misses essential ingredients to her becoming whole and what
[time=2445] Christ then does is steps in and helps her deal productively with the absence. And she
[time=2451] can mature in Christ and she can become exceedingly godly under those circumstances. But that's not the same thing as her being completely and maturely loved by her husband. But that's
[time=2464] motivating, guys. We're it. Think of it this way. Think of a safety deposit box at the
[time=2473] bank. There are two keys. The bank holds one and you hold the other one. You go there
[time=2482] and the bank official puts their key in and turns it. Now the only way that box is going to open up. There's only one other key in the world that can open that box. It's the
[time=2494] one you hold in your hand. That's a good picture of your relationship to your wife.
[time=2501] By God's design as her husband, you hold certain things in your power to give that she cannot
[time=2508] receive anywhere else. And I'm not just talking about sex. I'm talking about the wholeness
[time=2515] of her being and her existence. And unless you consistently and faithfully and will get to this with understanding, put your key in there and open it. Her box doesn't get opened.
[time=2527] That part of who she is never flourishes. That part of what God designed her to be never
[time=2533] blossoms into what it can be. So love your wife. And love your wife with the bold confidence
[time=2544] that you're the only man that God ever created to do that to her. She either gets it from
[time=2551] you or she doesn't get it. Now it's interesting. The inverse is also true. And we'll get to
[time=2557] that in a next message. The wife holds things that the husband can only have and receive
[time=2565] in his relationship with his wife. When it says one flesh, you guys, it means a lot,
[time=2572] a lot. I mean, it's power packed with things that go on inside of that unique relationship
[time=2579] and that you just don't duplicate it. You just don't go out and buy it somewhere else.
[time=2583] It's exciting. But when it doesn't happen, it's painful. You say, well, okay, love my
[time=2591] wife in an understanding way. Where does that come from? First Peter 3. Come on over to first Peter 3 for a minute. I'll show you the other major phrase that really captures the essence of the New Testament with respect to the husband's relationship to his wife.
[time=2609] First Peter 3 verse 7. You husbands likewise live with your wives in an understanding way.
[time=2622] Live with your wives in an understanding way. Now this is something you've got to admit
[time=2629] to. There are men in this room who are practical geniuses in various areas. Some of you understand
[time=2640] how to build a house from absolutely nothing to completion and it's gorgeous and you have
[time=2647] mastered an understanding of how to do that. Others of you are engineers and you can engineer
[time=2655] a motor and the dynamics that go on and things I can't even describe because I was never very good in that area. But you have gone into an area of understanding and absolutely mastered it from beginning to computer experts, accountants, physicians. You just explode
[time=2673] in your ability to understand that concept and to apply it skillfully and with wisdom and many of you are rewarded handsomely for your understanding and skill. Many of you
[time=2687] have not spent an eighth of that time and energy trying to understand your wife. You
[time=2697] haven't read any books on it. You haven't gone to any seminars on it. You haven't paid
[time=2703] for any advice. We call it counseling. If you get advice in your business setting, it's
[time=2709] kind of a prestigious thing. You say, "Well, we've hired a consultant." And it goes, "Ooh, that's big, consultant." But you fast up and say, "We're going to go get some help from
[time=2720] a counselor." Here it goes, "Ooh, that's bad. I got marriage problems." Man, I just
[time=2726] detest that notion. You probably have advisors in every meaningful area of your life, your
[time=2732] finances, big decisions in business. You have an advisor for your future investing in your retirement, but you refuse to let a skillful consultant into your life to help you understand
[time=2745] me. Not just like this little league attempt. I mean, a major understanding of who your
[time=2752] wife is. And so you see her doing these things and you don't understand them. And you feel
[time=2759] very satisfied to put your hands in your pockets and look at your buddy and say, "Women."
[time=2765] You know? And you don't understand what an embarrassing confession you make when you
[time=2771] say that. Absolutely embarrassing. You have fallen down short in God's priority for your
[time=2781] ability to love your wife. You must understand her. Now, I don't mean to say by that that
[time=2790] I understand mine totally and completely, but I can tell you that we've spent a great number of hours with consultants, reading books, with other people giving us insight
[time=2803] into who she is and how she works and who I am and how I work and how we can make this thing really meaningful. But don't misunderstand me. I find myself a long way, but I'm in the
[time=2814] pursuit and I know it's the most important pursuit in my life. You say, "Okay, well
[time=2820] then what does she want?" I mean, tell me how do I live with my wife in an understanding
[time=2826] way? And as with the first hour, I have a couple, but I'll probably only be able to have time to give you the first one. Maybe the most important one. Here it is, ready?
[time=2835] She wants a man who will do whatever it takes to engage her on a deep, emotional level.
[time=2844] Now beyond the fact that you're a Christian and beyond the fact that you live within the parameters of God's Word and beyond that you're a man of integrity, those things are, let's call those basic fundamental realities. She wouldn't have ever married you in the first place if those weren't there. But as it relates to your relationship with her, she wants you to be able to engage her on a deep, emotional level. I heard of a situation this week. It
[time=2867] was Christmas time. Actually, this couple had been so busy through the Christmas holiday that they had not been able to observe Christmas on Christmas day. And so they looked at each other and said, "My goodness." And they finally said, "Okay, this night will be our Christmas." And they set the fireplace and they're on the rug and sipping some, you know, Christmas eggnog and all the rest. And he reaches behind his back and brings out this gift. And as he
[time=2891] does this, she notices that he's got tears in his eyes. And she says, "You know, honey,
[time=2897] what's the matter?" And he says, "You know, I have been thinking about this gift." And
[time=2907] I enjoyed every minute of finding the one that I wanted to give you. And I was thrilled
[time=2916] in my heart that I had the money to buy it. And I've been anxious just anticipating this moment when I could actually give it to you. And I guess I'm just overwhelmed with how
[time=2927] much I truly love you and appreciate you. And I'm thankful for our relationship.
[time=2934] Well, she started crying. They hugged each other. They embraced in tears, crying over
[time=2942] the realization of how much they mean to each other and how deeply they can connect. Let
[time=2949] me ask you guys a question. When was the last time you connected at that level emotionally
[time=2957] with your wife? When was the last time? Let me ask you another question. How many of you
[time=2967] men are capable, capable of relating at that level with your wife? Some of you are sitting
[time=2978] there with a very suspicious eye saying, "I don't know what that guy's problem was that night, but man, that's out of bounds for me." You know, kind of doing the John Wayne hub of thing in the Bears. Let's play football. I just want to remind you that the one that
[time=2995] you're supposed to be becoming like, his name is Jesus, it's called being Christ-like.
[time=3000] He wept in public, several occasions. He was, he had not lived his life in such a way that
[time=3009] he had shut off his emotions and nipped them in the bud and cauterized the nerve endings
[time=3015] of his emotional life. In fact, he had lived his life in a way that allowed those things to come to fruition. And if you are going to become like Christ, you too are going to
[time=3028] have to do some work on your ability to relate to people emotionally, particularly your wife.
[time=3036] Because when you don't, she misses out on a vital part of what it means to be in relationship
[time=3042] with somebody else. And you're the most important relationship in her life or should be. And
[time=3049] you deprive her and rob her and yourself of experiencing what it means to be created
[time=3055] in the image of God. Here's a third question. How many of you were raised in rich, emotionally
[time=3065] nurturing homes? How many of you men can say that in your home, it was an emotionally
[time=3072] rich environment where you were allowed and encouraged to talk about your fears, where
[time=3078] you were able to admit your weaknesses. A home that placed a value on listening and understanding.
[time=3085] That kind of thing was like normal and commonplace for you so that you could develop those kinds of things in your life. For most of us, it was the absolute opposite of that. We were
[time=3096] trained to be competitors, not listeners, achievers, not empathizers, overcomers, not sensitive conversationalists. We were taught that we should never whine. We should always
[time=3107] work hard. We should win at all costs. We should conquer. We should win. We should be victorious. And we were taught there is no place for emotions in that kind of world.
[time=3119] Your emotions will only set you back. It will make you weak. It will get you off track.
[time=3123] Well, you see, all that stuff comes right out of the pit that is not the Christ of the
[time=3129] New Testament. By the way, he was very powerful. He accomplished everything he was supposed to do. He defeated Satan and sin and secured for the glory of God, the redeemed church.
[time=3140] And he did it as a man who was fully aware of his emotions and in fact, that made him even more powerful to the people he encountered. So whatever it takes, guys, in your remaining
[time=3158] years, whatever it takes for you to be able to engage your wife at a deep, emotional level.
[time=3166] And you see, why is that so important? And I'll tell you why, because once you are there with her, you will begin to understand her in a way that you can't independent of that.
[time=3176] You know, the Bible talks about when you suffer, it equips you to comfort others when they suffer because you've known suffering. You can be with another person in suffering and they know there's a connection. When you don't experience your emotions and you can't relate
[time=3192] to her in emotional level, you can forget her consistently being able to open up to you in a level that will then allow you to serve her effectively and creatively and meaningfully.
[time=3203] You're going to be forever resigned to reacting to her reactions, trying to avoid the pitfalls, trying to stay out of the danger zones, trying to manage the home. It's not until you connect with her and convince her you're capable of such a connection that she begins to reveal to you what's really inside of her heart and what's really in her mind. Everything else
[time=3226] is being held at armless length. So it's important so that you can serve her voluntarily and
[time=3233] skillfully and secondly so that you can inspire her. It isn't until you really know where a person is hurting and the insecurities that they're really feeling and the pain that they're really carrying. It isn't until you're there with them, burden bearing in Galatian 6, that you're able to say the kinds of things and move in the kinds of ways that genuinely
[time=3253] to the core of their being inspire them to be something great for God. Without that level
[time=3260] of understanding, they are denied you as a resource and they try to struggle it alone,
[time=3269] something they were never meant to do. Well, think about some of those things and if you're
[time=3280] really feeling bold and courageous, maybe over lunch today, instead of defending your
[time=3286] lack of emotional connection with her and tearing this Sermon all the shreds and kind of getting her back on track, right? That's kind of what happened last week, right?
[time=3299] Okay. Ask her this one little simple question. You might preface it with go easy on me. To
[time=3309] what degree do you feel that I am connecting with you emotionally? And then if you're like
[time=3321] still sitting in your chair and stuff like that after she answers, you might ask her another question. Honey, would you like answer on an anonymous test where nobody could know
[time=3333] the answer except you and God. To this question, is your husband? Let's put this way. Are you
[time=3340] the first thing in your husband's life as an expression of his love to God? Honey, would
[time=3347] you be able to put me down like yes? Or have I kind of gone the way of so many others?
[time=3354] And I've just put you on the back burner and I'm just managing you. Wow, that could open
[time=3360] it up. You could have some great conversations if you're gentle with each other. Maybe it
[time=3368] would be enough to seek some help, read some books, talk with some friends. You know what?
[time=3375] Interesting thing over in Ephesians 5, remember what it said? Because if you love your wife this way, you're actually loving yourself. God knows that when we as husbands step into
[time=3386] this role and do it as he designed, it is the most rewarding thing in the world. There's nothing out there that can touch the joy and the excitement of being in a relationship
[time=3397] with a woman like he designed it. Let's pray together.
