In a few moments you'll hear from our guest speaker, Dr. Paul Dixon, who's the president of Cedarville College in Cedarville, Ohio. Last week I mentioned a very important date and I want to mention it again this week. It's May 19th.
[time=748] That's a Thursday evening when Black Hawk Baptist Church will host in concert Ray Bolz. Ray Bolz is a native of Indiana.
[time=756] He always packs out our auditorium when he comes and I hope that you'll set aside that date. Tickets are available at all of the Christian bookstores in the Fort Wayne area and you can even stop here at Black Hawk Baptist Church and purchase your tickets so they are $5. They're going very rapidly so I hope that you'll join with us.
[time=777] Again that concert is Thursday evening May 19th.
[time=781] Here's a little bit of music from Ray Bolz.
[time=784] [MUSIC - 21 seconds]
[time=814] And I'd like to tell you also about the fact that we are still offering the little rose pin in commemoration of Mother's Day. Many of you have written for it and if you'd like to receive that pin honoring our mothers just right for us tell us that you're watching the Bible hour and we'll send you the pin absolutely free.

[time=1154] Thank you, Brian.
[time=1159] Composer Ranger Don Wertzen once said that the greatest song was ever written as it relates to theology is Jesus loves me.
[time=1166] This I know, for the Bible tells me so.
[time=1169] Little ones, to him be long, they are weak, but he is strong.
[time=1173] Yes, Jesus loves me.
[time=1176] We have a special guest speaker today, but we consider him a real friend of Black Hawk, and we're so glad that Dr. Paul Dixon, President of Cedarville College is here with us this morning.
[time=1185] One of the benefits I have is hearing him in the first service and knowing that I could just tell you, you just better get ready because it's going to be a great message.
[time=1192] He always does a wonderful job in challenging us, and if you were to take a tour of Cedarville College over the last few years
[time=1198] and see the progress and the buildings and the students, it would really excite you.
[time=1202] If you ever get over in that area, you should visit Cedarville College.
[time=1206] He will contribute to the leadership of Dr. Dixon over the last 15 years or so.
[time=1211] That's a great delight to have him here, and I think we should welcome him to Black Hawk as he comes to the pulpit, Dr. Dixon.
[time=1217] (applause)
[time=1223] Oh, thank you very much.
[time=1225] I want to say what a blessing the music has been this morning.
[time=1228] It's been a real treat to sit here, not only here the quality of it, but have it point our hearts and our minds toward heaven.
[time=1236] I've always appreciated Black Hawk so very, very much.
[time=1240] In fact, I had the privilege of holding the first evangelistic campaign in the history of this church.
[time=1247] Some 23, 24 years ago, when you met over there in that double-wide trailer,
[time=1253] I had the opportunity that the invitation of David Jeremiah to come in and hold that meeting and then back on several occasions and delighted that I could come and represent the Lord in Cedarville today.
[time=1265] I'm thrilled to see the way God continues to bless the church, praise God for the ministry of Pastor Moore and his wife, and I know that God's using them at Gold Lake and you're looking forward to their return for this rest of this week.
[time=1282] And I also want to say how much I appreciate your faithful support of Cedarville College.
[time=1288] You support us financially on a regular basis.
[time=1292] You also have been kind to step up to the plate when we've done various construction projects.
[time=1298] And you have sent us literally scores of marvelous young people to be a part of our college family.
[time=1306] And a number of them have come back, along with others, to be a part of your church family and a part of your Christian school.
[time=1313] So we rejoice in that relationship.
[time=1315] Whenever I go out to speak, I ask my secretary to get me a list of all of the donors, all of the students,
[time=1324] anyone who's ever applied, all the graduates from a church.
[time=1328] And when I got the one from your church, it was literally the computer readout was page after page after page after page
[time=1336] of the relationships that we share with your people.
[time=1340] I also want to say that as we look at the Christian college movement, there are so many fine colleges.
[time=1347] Thank the Lord for the way God is blessing here in the tailored extension, the former Summit College.
[time=1356] Jay Kessler is a personal friend of mine.
[time=1360] But also I'm glad that Brother Neheis and his family are members of your church.
[time=1364] When I got up in the morning service and was doing this and talked about Jay Kessler, I didn't know that they were here until about halfway through the message I spotted them.
[time=1373] And I've known them for a long time and greatly appreciate this family too.
[time=1376] So praise God for what he's doing in other Christian schools.
[time=1380] Cedarville is just one of many.
[time=1383] We enrolled 2300 students this approximately this last fall.
[time=1389] It was another record enrollment.
[time=1391] We frankly are committed to managing that enrollment.
[time=1395] We have far more applications than we can take.
[time=1397] We've already had approximately 1600 applications for next year's class and we can't begin to take all of those.
[time=1405] But it's thrilling to see the interest and often people ask why is there so much interest in Cedarville today.
[time=1412] And I would have to say that of course we know that it's God, but it's probably the fact that we've built some very strong academic programs.
[time=1423] For instance, our largest major is business.
[time=1426] We have about 400 business majors.
[time=1428] Very strong in education.
[time=1430] And the list is long.
[time=1432] But almost 30% of our students would be found in the sciences.
[time=1436] We have 300 in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program.
[time=1439] Chemistry, biology, math, pre-med.
[time=1443] And now we have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering and about 175 in those programs.
[time=1451] We've finished a $7 million Engineering Nursing Science Center with the latest in technology, the latest in labs.
[time=1459] We have a computer network where every student this fall with the exception of 5%,
[time=1465] 95% of all students walking into their dormitory rooms interface with one another,
[time=1471] with the classrooms, with the offices and the library 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
[time=1477] They're on internet so they communicate all over the world.
[time=1480] There's $100,000 worth of software on there.
[time=1482] We have been recognized along with MIT and Rutgers and Penn State as having one of the finest computer networks in the United States.
[time=1490] So it kind of gives you a sense of what we're doing and as we're moving into the 21st century.
[time=1495] We major on chapel, on missions, on Christian ministry.
[time=1500] You put all that together and the Lord's blessing and we just praise him for it.
[time=1504] Out on the table we have some literature.
[time=1506] Please help yourselves to it.
[time=1508] This is our normal torch magazine that we've put in the form of an annual report that I'd love for you to pick up.
[time=1515] And also there are other pieces of literature out there, help yourselves, and if you would take the time to put your name and address on that sheet, we'll send you our four-color torch magazine four times a year at no charge.
[time=1530] Let me ask you a question.
[time=1532] If I could give you one word, just one,
[time=1538] that would guarantee you success in every area of your life,
[time=1545] would you be willing to put that word into your computer?
[time=1551] Now I think I can give you the word.
[time=1553] It comes from the word of God, but it's up to you and it's up to me whether we program it in.
[time=1560] Take your Bibles, please, and turn to the book of Philippians chapter 1.
[time=1566] Philippians 1.
[time=1570] And as soon as I say Philippians, you Bible students say I know what it is.
[time=1576] If he's going to speak from Philippians, it has to be joy.
[time=1580] For you know that some form of joy is found 18 times in Philippians.
[time=1588] Either joy or rejoice or rejoicing, if you've never written it young people, they're in your Bible.
[time=1597] When you start Philippians, you ought to write down the key verse for the entire book is 4-4.
[time=1605] It says rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say rejoice.
[time=1611] Great word, but it's not the word today.
[time=1616] Some of you say I know what it is, because there's another theme that permeates the book.
[time=1623] It's the intellect.
[time=1626] The word mind is found 10 times in Philippians.
[time=1631] Think occurs five times, and on one occasion the word remember.
[time=1636] So 16 times the Apostle Paul talks about the importance of the intellect.
[time=1642] Ladies and gentlemen, we live in a day when there is much focus on experience oriented, emotionally oriented Christianity.
[time=1655] We must understand that though experience is important and emotion is important, God places major emphasis upon the mind.
[time=1665] God deliver us from a mindless Christianity. Come now and let us reason together saith the Lord.
[time=1673] We need minds for the glory of God, but that's not the word.
[time=1678] In fact the word that I want to share with you that guarantee success is not found in the book except in your NIV.
[time=1686] It is modeled by the author throughout, for the word that guarantees success is attitude.
[time=1697] Think about it, attitude.
[time=1701] Chuck Swindall said it, I believe it, life is 10% what happens to you, 90% how you respond to what happens.
[time=1710] To illustrate it he tells the story of the great Niccolo Paganini who was playing his violin at a concert and as he played the string snap.
[time=1718] Continuing the second string snap going right on the third string snap and when he finished, I mean not only did the crowd stand for the ovation but so did the orchestra and he immediately told him to be seated.
[time=1733] You mean he's going to play an encore? With one hand holding up the bow and the other hand holding up the violin with the strings hanging down he exclaimed Paganini and one string and he played a beautiful encore.
[time=1748] Got another standing ovation and life young people is 10% what happens to you, 90% how you respond to what happens.
[time=1762] String snap in all of our lives.
[time=1767] Perhaps it's like one of our students this week who had a mother to die and so it is the string of death.
[time=1777] Or another of our students who is battling leukemia and so it is the string of disease.
[time=1786] Perhaps it's like one of our students who in the last ten days was out hiking in the Clifton Gorge and fell 40 feet and is in the hospital right now.
[time=1797] Praise God those she had a back operation it doesn't look like there's any kind of paralysis but you talk about a string that snapped not only for Shannon but for her parents who live in Indianapolis and hold all the anxiety that goes with an accident like that.
[time=1814] Maybe it's the string of divorce.
[time=1819] One of the saddest things that comes our way is the student who comes to me and says President, pray for me my mom and dad are getting divorced this week with tears running down her cheeks or tears running down his cheeks and all the pain of divorce.
[time=1834] Or just a string of disappointment at work you didn't get the promotion or you got the pink slip or you just don't know what the future holds or maybe it's disappointment at church.
[time=1848] What's going on at church or with people in the church or friends? I don't know what the strings are. I just know that life is 10% what happens to us, 90% how we respond to what happens and when Paul writes the book, strings are snapping in his life.
[time=1865] He's not a free man young people. He's under house arrest. He's having to defend his apostleship.
[time=1873] There are those who believe the Bible and preach the Bible who are criticizing Paul something fierce and Paul is able to say praise God they're still preaching Jesus.
[time=1884] I rejoice that Christ is preached even if they criticize me. I don't often respond like that do you?
[time=1894] How do you get that kind of an attitude?
[time=1897] Well I think we'll know if we just briefly study the book. Now here's what I want to do. I want to give you the skeleton, the outline of the book and then you can study it for yourself maybe throughout the course of the week.
[time=1909] When I was in Bible college Charlie Woodbridge came and challenged us to read the book of Philippians every day for a month and I have to tell you it changed my life as a young man.
[time=1924] Consider doing that for the month of May reading the book of Philippians every day in the month of May. Now I'll give you the outline for the book.
[time=1933] Number one in chapter one the focus is on Christ. In chapter two the focus is on Christians.
[time=1941] Chapter three the focus is on heaven and he concludes the book in chapter four with the focus on the positive.
[time=1950] Let's start back in chapter one. What I want you to do is take your Bible and take a pen for there's some things I want you to mark.
[time=1957] In chapter one let's begin reading at verse four. "Always in every prayer of mine for you all making requests with joy for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now and circle that fellowship in the gospel."
[time=1972] Verse 12 "But I would you should understand brethren that things would happen not to me have fallen out rather unto the circle that's the furtherance of the gospel."
[time=1982] Circle that furtherance of the gospel. Verse 27 "Only let your conversation be as it become at the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for here it is again circled at the faith of the gospel."
[time=2001] So in verse five we have the fellowship in the gospel in verse 12 the furtherance of the gospel and in verse 27 the faith of the gospel.
[time=2011] The man is obsessed with the gospel. Boys and girls do you know what the gospel is? Let me give this to you so you don't forget it.
[time=2021] The gospel is the death, the burial and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It's who Jesus is and what he's done.
[time=2033] The apostle Paul ate, slept, thought the gospel. It dominated his thinking. Why?
[time=2046] Because he had experienced the gospel on the Damascus road, he was a non-Christian, he persecuted Christians, he was a sinner on his way to hell and he came in contact with Jesus Christ, the crucified risen Lord.
[time=2060] Christ came into his life, forgave his sins, saved his soul, changed his life, he experienced the gospels. Is that ever happened to you?
[time=2069] Did to me? When I was a senior at Norwood High School in Cincinnati I didn't go to church, I had no interest in the things of God, but on a Sunday night I walked into the Norwood Baptist church, first time I'd ever been to a church on a Sunday night in my life.
[time=2086] I heard the gospel, the pastor gave the invitation, pastor Mitchell Seidre, I walked down the aisle, I received Christ, I went back to school with a Bible up on top of my books, determined to win every kid in the senior class to Christ before I graduated. What happened? I experienced the gospel.
[time=2106] Now my challenge, and Paul's challenge, in God's challenge is to you today if you've never experienced the eternity changing, life changing, power the gospel, it's yours today if you will by faith receive Christ.
[time=2123] But did you notice that Paul didn't just experience the gospel, he grew in the gospel? He grew over to chapter 3, verse 10.
[time=2133] That I may know him, this Jesus Christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death.
[time=2145] The gospel didn't just save him, it was something that permeated his life that he could grow, that he could mature.
[time=2154] I share with our students a major concern, let me share it with you, there is so much apathy in Christianity today.
[time=2162] The major problem, the number one problem at Cedarville College, not only with the students, but with the faculty and the administration and the president is apathy.
[time=2178] And that's the number one problem in the church today. Now the question is why? I'm not sure, but let me give you a few suggestions.
[time=2190] In our college every year, when we start the year, I have all the students stand who have unsafe parents.
[time=2200] Generally about 5% of our student body will stand. And then all year long we pray for moms and dads to get saved.
[time=2211] And invariably year after year they are saved, not all of them, but some of them.
[time=2218] But what that tells me is that 95% of our kids are second and third generation Christians.
[time=2224] I praise God for that, that they have Christian parents, many of them have Christian grandparents, many of them growing up and find churches like this.
[time=2232] Many of them going through the Christian school movement, K through 12, and here they are at a Christian college and praise God for that.
[time=2239] But the danger is that the gospel becomes old hat.
[time=2245] We get used to it, we take it for granted, it doesn't motivate us, it doesn't excite us.
[time=2253] That's one of the major problems today is that we've lost sight of the gospel.
[time=2258] And I would pray that not only we would focus on the gospel for our salvation, but we would focus on the gospel throughout the rest of our lives.
[time=2266] So he experienced the gospel, he shared the gospel in verse 12.
[time=2271] I would you should understand brethren that things would happen unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=2279] He experienced it, he grew in it, and then he shared it.
[time=2284] And you think about what that verse says, teenagers, everything that happens in our lives is for the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=2293] My boyfriend breaks up with me for the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=2305] Men and women, the house is burning down.
[time=2309] I lose my job for the furtherance of the gospel.
[time=2313] I used to bring my evangelism class from Cedarville College to this church once a year to go out with your people on evangelism explosion.
[time=2327] David Jeremiah was kind enough to invite us to do that every year.
[time=2333] And it was always such a tremendous experience for our kids, but I still recall that day I walked in and this guy in a state troopers uniform,
[time=2344] reached out his hand and said, "My name's Doug Erickson." And he gave me his testimony and told me how that he'd been called as an unsaved state trooper to go to this lake in Goshen, Indiana where a young missionary had lost his life in a skiing accident.
[time=2370] Doug said he couldn't get over the way the family processed it, sure they were heartbroken, there were tears, but yet they gave it a perspective that he'd never seen before and he went to the funeral.
[time=2382] Now after the funeral, the father of the young man in the casket said, "Sir, would you have some time that I could talk with you and took him aside into a room and let him to Christ?"
[time=2399] Can you understand that this bereaved father could say, "I want you to understand brothers and sisters that everything that happens in my life is for the furtherance of the gospel?"
[time=2412] Oh, when we have that focus on Christ, what a difference it makes in our attitude.
[time=2417] Number two, in chapter two, he focused on Christians.
[time=2422] Now this is such a marvelous passage, I'll not read it all, but let's start with verse three, "Let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind that each esteem other better than themselves."
[time=2435] Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.
[time=2439] Let this mind be anew, which was also in Christ Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, made himself of no reputation, took upon him the form of a servant,
[time=2451] was made in the likeness of man.
[time=2454] Paul's having problems in the church to Philippi, here's the problem.
[time=2458] Brothers and sisters weren't getting along, they were strife.
[time=2463] He said, "Here's how to solve the problem. Look not every man on his own things, but every man on the things of others.
[time=2471] Who's our model for this? None other than the Lord Jesus, who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, made himself of no reputation, took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men."
[time=2486] Godly attitude never comes with a self-centered, self-seeking, self-serving spirit.
[time=2497] Godly attitude only comes from an other-centered spirit.
[time=2506] As Americans, we are so wrapped up in ourselves.
[time=2512] It is truly the Me generation. It surfaces in so many ways.
[time=2520] And yet as Christians, what's supposed to make us different is that we aren't wired that way.
[time=2530] Yet the problem that Paul had at the church in Philippi and many of the other churches that he started is the same problem we have today in a lot of our churches.
[time=2543] I did a survey a few years ago with 1600 Bible-believing Bible-preaching churches.
[time=2549] As I asked this question, how many of you have had a major split in the last five years defined a major split, and the answer came back in a statistically valid study, 25%.
[time=2563] Another 5% said we're about to split.
[time=2567] So my next question was what split the church?
[time=2572] Doctrine invariably did not split the church.
[time=2577] I said what split our church is that people couldn't get along with the pastor, people couldn't get along with one another, or they've had problems with the board, or the board had problems with one another.
[time=2588] It came down to people problems, bitterness, unforgiving spirits.
[time=2599] But ladies and gentlemen, Jesus said, "By this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one toward another."
[time=2609] That's supposed to characterize the church a whole lot of love.
[time=2615] And if we have the focus on each other, not only the focus on Christ and who He is, but on His that He has redeemed brothers and sisters who make up the church, and we're looking out for their needs, and not our own needs, what a difference it makes.
[time=2628] What a difference it makes and our attitude.
[time=2632] What a testimony it is in the community.
[time=2636] Number three, and chapter three, Paul said the focus ought to be on heaven.
[time=2642] Would you turn to verses 20 and 21 as Paul concludes chapter three?
[time=2648] Our conversation or our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=2652] And once also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body according to the working whereby He is able, even to subdue all things unto Himself.
[time=2666] Our citizenship is in heaven.
[time=2670] Listen carefully, young people, a temporal focus never will produce a godly attitude, only an eternal focus.
[time=2683] Earthly focus doesn't do it, but rather a heavenly focus.
[time=2690] I've had a ministry with professional athletes for the last 19 years.
[time=2697] In fact, I'll be speaking at a major conference in Atlanta this week when a lot of sports organizations from throughout the United States will be gathering who minister to athletes at the college level and at the professional level.
[time=2715] And I still remember when I walked into the Cincinnati Reds locker room that year when one of the pitchers came walking in with his Bible and a book of systematic theology.
[time=2729] Now you have to understand these athletes don't bring their Bibles to chapel, let alone books of systematic theology.
[time=2739] And so when the chapel was over, I said, "Frank, what's going on?" He told me.
[time=2745] I said, "You have to share that with our college family."
[time=2751] So about 10 days later, I stood up to speak and said, "Before I speak today, I want to introduce you to a friend of mine, Frank Pastore, the Cincinnati Reds, would you please come to the platform?"
[time=2763] I came up, I said, "Frank, tell everyone what God has done for you."
[time=2771] I said, "12 months ago, I was standing on the mound at Riverfront, I was 5-2, the two-point ERA, having the greatest year of my life, and one of the Los Angeles Dodgers hit a line drive off of my arm."
[time=2784] I wasn't to pitch the rest of the year.
[time=2787] I have all this time on my hands, I'm an avid reader, I'm an agnostic, I'm an evolutionist, and somebody said, "Have you ever read the creationist side?"
[time=2795] He said, "Ah, those people aren't very intelligent." He said, "I don't like to read unintelligent stuff." He said, "Look, just give it a try. How about reading this book?" And he gave me this book called "The Genesis Flood" by Whitcomb and Morris.
[time=2809] Frank said, "I read it and became a creationist."
[time=2815] I then said, "If God has revealed himself in creation, is it possible God has revealed himself in the Bible, so I started reading books about the Bible."
[time=2824] And concluded it's the verbally inspired word of God.
[time=2827] I then said, "If God has revealed himself in creation and in the Bible is the trueest revealed himself in his son Jesus Christ, I read the Gospel of John, got down on my knees and accepted Christ as my Savior.
[time=2838] From the time I started my search until the day I became a Christian it was six weeks.
[time=2844] From that day until this, ten and a half months ago I read all the Old Testament, all the New Testament, and three thousand pages of Christian literature.
[time=2853] You begin to get the idea this is new ordinary athlete.
[time=2856] He had a full academic scholarship to Stanford University.
[time=2861] That's on Monday. On Friday a bone chip moved in Frank's arm while he was pitching at Riverfront.
[time=2870] They took him out of the game. I immediately called him.
[time=2873] I said, "Frank, what's going on?" I said, "How are you doing?" He said, "Well, I'm in a lot of pain."
[time=2880] I said, "I can imagine, but I'm really asking another question." He said, "What's that?" I said, "How are you doing with God? How are you doing spiritually?" Because so often the athletes say, "God's on my side.
[time=2892] I'm going to be saw a young award winner. God's on my side. I'm going to hit 30 home runs." Sometimes we approach Christianity the same way. Bad things don't happen to God's people, right?
[time=2906] God is a God of the mountains, and he's a God of the valleys. I said, "Frank, how are you doing spiritually?"
[time=2915] He said, "Paul, I want to ask you a question." Is God sovereign or isn't he?
[time=2921] I knew he'd been reading that book of systematic theology. Is God God or isn't he?
[time=2927] If he's God, didn't he know about that bone chip and my elbow?
[time=2932] What difference does it make Paul if I never pitch another inning?
[time=2937] Maybe God wants me to preach. Do you have any seminaries you'd like to recommend?
[time=2943] Every once in a while I get a letter from Frank Pastore. Frank is heading up a program and completing a program at Talbot Seminary.
[time=2952] What I want to know is how does a 10 and a half month old Christian somehow say,
[time=2959] "A million dollars a year doesn't make any difference." All you have to do today if you can pitch at all is throw your glove on the mound
[time=2967] and you get a million dollars. How can a 10 and a half month old Christian somehow say,
[time=2974] "It doesn't matter. God's in control." I'll tell you how. He had a focus on heaven.
[time=2979] He knew there was far more to it than just our fleeting years down here.
[time=2983] What a difference that focus makes in our attitude. A focus on Christ, focus on Christians, focus on heaven, and a focus on the positive in chapter 4.
[time=2994] I want you to notice that eighth verse. Young people, let me encourage you to memorize this verse.
[time=3001] Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure,
[time=3010] whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things have good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
[time=3019] What does Paul say? He's saying, "Be a positive thinker."
[time=3027] Don't misunderstand Paul. Did he deal with sin if there was sin in the church? Absolutely. Did he confront brothers and sisters if they needed to be confronted? Absolutely.
[time=3040] But did you ever notice that if he had a problem in the church, he always started out by commending them and making some positive statements before he addressed the needs.
[time=3050] And he always did it with a positive spirit. See, that's the key in our families. When we deal with problems, do we have to be firm? Absolutely.
[time=3059] But we do it with a positive spirit. That's the way we deal with everything. On the job, will I have to deal with problems at the college?
[time=3067] Sure, you have to confront them. You don't hide them under the rug, but it's the kind of an attitude that you have when you deal with them.
[time=3075] We live in such a negative society. I am not a Bill Clinton fan. I didn't vote for him. I don't plan to vote for him in '96.
[time=3091] But I watched intently how he handled things Friday night. And I just returned from a dinner and President Nixon had died.
[time=3104] And Bill Clinton walked out there in front of the White House and I thought he did it with real dignity. And I was so glad that he didn't take the occasion to say anything about Watergate.
[time=3117] Was there a Watergate? Sure. Was it serious? Absolutely. But somehow he and incidentally since everything I've been watching wants to focus on all the positive accomplishments.
[time=3130] And now they're saying that this man dominated the American political scene for the last 40 years.
[time=3139] Isn't it interesting how they start doing that after you die? Good news. Maybe some people say something positive after you die, right?
[time=3151] Oh, now is the time to do it. To reinforce our kids. To reinforce our leaders. To somehow be positive and be able to give it that kind of perspective as we move through life.
[time=3164] What you think is what you're are. And listen young people, if you develop a negative mindset you will be a critical judgmental person.
[time=3177] And God won't bless your life. And God won't bless your family. And God won't bless your ministry.
[time=3185] Oh, what a difference it makes when we decide to buy the grace of God we're going to be a positive people.
[time=3191] I can still remember that night as I drove home and drove into my driveway.
[time=3198] And I went back to the bedroom to get ready for bed and Pat was watching the evening news at 11 o'clock.
[time=3205] When all of a sudden she came running back into the bedroom and said Paul there's been a serious auto accident out on Highway 68 and just as Shirley as we're standing here I know it's our kids.
[time=3216] And now at that time the phone started ringing. And I picked it up and the hospital said Green Hospital they said there's been a serious accident.
[time=3227] It's all your kids and some of them are asking if you can come. So immediately we took off for the hospital there were two deaths that night.
[time=3238] We ended up going to four different hospitals. One of the young men had every bone in his face broken, very close to our family.
[time=3253] And that night as he was there in that hospital God started working in his life and he was able to put him in perspective and he lived.
[time=3266] After he was in the hospital about six weeks I said Jeff would you come to the chapel and give your testimony before you go home and so he stood up there and he said listen.
[time=3279] I want you to know that last night my nurse came in and I said before I leave I want to know do you know if you died right now you'd go to heaven she said no I don't Jeff.
[time=3291] He said could I show you how and she said I'd love for you too and I led my nurse to Christ and all the spinal taps and all the myelograms and everything I've gone through.
[time=3303] It's all still there all the pain all the questions but I want you to know if the only reason God allowed me to go through this was to leave my nurse to Christ it was all worth it.
[time=3314] Life is ten percent what happens to us ninety percent how we respond.
[time=3323] The key to success is attitude. Would you bow with me in prayer please.
[time=3329] Every head bowed and every eye closed and as the instrumentalists come and just start playing the invitation song of the hour I surrender all.
[time=3342] In a minute we're going to stand and we're going to sing.
[time=3347] But I want to challenge all of you here today if you've never received Christ as your Savior as we sing this song would you get up out of your seat and would you come and would you today give us a privilege of showing you how to be saved.
[time=3360] Thank you Father for speaking to our hearts and we pray not by might nor by power but by the Spirit.
[time=3366] The people will come to know the Savior in His name amen. Let's stand together shall we.
[time=3396] I'm really thankful for good Christian music the music today on the Bible hours presented by our sanctuary choir and soloist Michelle Smekens and Brian Lowson.
[time=3416] The message was from our special guest Dr. Paul Dixon who's the president of Cedarville College in Cedarville Ohio.
[time=3423] If as a result of today's program you made a decision that you want to trust Christ as your Savior.
[time=3429] I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer as we always do each week. Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3435] Dear Heavenly Father I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I'm a sinner.
[time=3441] I've sinned against you and I ask for your forgiveness and I ask you to become my Savior today.
[time=3447] Come into my heart dear Lord. In Jesus name I pray amen.
[time=3453] If you prayed that prayer today why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3457] When you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance" it'll help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
