[time=0] of a woman.
[time=2] Submission consists of a woman warmly responding and meaningfully supporting a man's involvement
[time=13] in his life, and I'll finish it up now, in a way that promotes his godliness.

[time=679] (audience applauds)
[time=685] - Well it's a wonderful song coming out of the Old Testament, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who in faithful obedience to God, were thrown by King Nebuchadnezzar into the fiery furnace, and God delivered them.
[time=697] And what a wonderful thing it is to know that that same God is alive and active in our own lives.
[time=704] And as we face our own trials and dilemmas and hardship and fiery trials, you can't believe it.
[time=711] There's two trials and dilemmas and hardship and fiery trials that the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego still lives and desires to give us strength to pursue and obey.
[time=722] It's good to be back.
[time=723] Last week, Heidi and I were up at Gold Lake Bible Conference in Michigan, preaching and teaching the word of God.
[time=729] And we're thankful for the ministry of Paul Dixon, who is here, and I understand that a phenomenal job, what a gifted leader and communicator of God's truth.
[time=738] We're thankful to be back with you today in our series on marriage.
[time=742] And if you've been at a step with us, let me just remind you briefly.
[time=746] Today would be our third message on that.
[time=748] The first was kind of trying to describe what happens inside of a lot of marriages where people begin to settle for second best, almost inadvertently, without even a conscious choice.
[time=759] Sometimes they just find themselves in what we call coexistence, where the passionate pursuit of intimacy has been left long ago, and they can't seem to bear the pain of continuing to pursue each other.
[time=772] And so they just coexist at safe distances, and they try to avoid the difficult parts of their marriage that experience has taught them to stay away from that stuff.
[time=781] And while it may be functional, and while it may have a public persona of functionality,
[time=790] it is in reality a very lonely, a very painful, and a very empty way to live.
[time=795] And it's not God's design for marriage.
[time=798] We contrasted that in our first marriage with what God intended back there in the book of Genesis when he said you could become one flesh, and he described that even in its pre-fall condition as being naked and not ashamed, the husband and wife, naked and not ashamed, vulnerable to each other, open emotionally and mentally and spiritually, nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of, forgiving and graciously, compassionately, moving to live with power and to strength to grow the other person in the maturity to Christ.
[time=829] And then we came back in the next message and spoke a word to the husbands and tried to just paint with a broad brush of what God might be saying to husbands, and we came up with a little phrase, it seems awfully simple, but I think it's profound when we live it out in our lives, and it's this, God expects husbands to love their wives with understanding.
[time=851] And we remember the word love talking about the energy of a man's heart and soul being directed at his wife.
[time=857] We looked at Ephesians 5 and the love that Christ had for the church as its analogy to how husbands are to love their wives and found that that love produced an effect of maturity and growth and wholeness in the bride, a wholeness that the bride could never know without the love of the groom.
[time=875] So that kind of a love and a love that would be filled with understanding and we remember how as men, we seem very capable of moving into a particular field or an arena of business and mastering whatever that is, learning and studying and conferences and manuals and hard knocks, whatever it takes for us to understand completely the discipline to which we've given ourselves will nail that thing, will know that, will understand that.
[time=901] But somehow we've justified in our own minds kind of a hub-a-hub-a among the men's snub response women who can understand them.
[time=910] And what a pathetic confession that really is when we say we do not understand our lives.
[time=917] When in reality God has said to us there, we looked at it in 1 Peter 3, that the ability to love and to love with a transforming love begins with a deep, intimate understanding of who a woman is and more particularly who your wife is and how you can use your resources and your strength to mature perfect and complete her.
[time=939] This morning I'd like to move a little bit towards a discussion of wives and I've kind of heard through the great mind that many of the ladies in our assembly were kind of even with fear and trepidation coming last Sunday to be somewhat relieved that I wasn't here to address that topic and that it only then postponed the trauma until this week.
[time=962] And I just want to put you ladies at rest.
[time=964] I really am not going to say much directly to you.
[time=968] I don't intend to scold you in any way.
[time=972] I really want to talk about a wife and what the role of a wife is.
[time=978] And I hope you'll feel supported by me this morning and by the word of God.
[time=983] I believe you should be.
[time=985] And so just by way of introduction, let me have thank you for letting me say that and try to tune in with me this morning and stay with this thing and find out what God has for you.
[time=995] If you'd open your Bible, come to Ephesians 5 again.
[time=998] We'll look at two passages just to get ourselves set and get our bearing set.
[time=1004] And then we'll move to try to apply the truth or understand its implication having done that part.
[time=1011] Ephesians 5 has instruction about relationships.
[time=1019] In fact, the whole thing begins in 5, 18, where it says do not be drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but be filled with the spirit.
[time=1031] That's the main thing that God is trying to transition to in this book of Ephesians that really provides an umbrella thought for everything else to follow underneath that.
[time=1040] What God is saying to the believer is, as you anticipate being in relationship with other people, the first thing you've got to do is be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[time=1049] What that actually means is that we need to subject our lives to the authority of God, not as a task or a duty as much as his strength coming inside of us to empower us to live the way that he wants to, and particularly in terms with relationships.
[time=1066] In verse 22 of chapter 5, you'll see we're going to hear about wives.
[time=1070] In verse 25, we're going to hear about husbands.
[time=1073] In chapter 6, verse 1, we're going to hear about relationship to children.
[time=1076] And then in verse 4, relationship of a father to his children.
[time=1081] In verse 5, we hear how employees or slaves, as they were called, are to be in relationship to their masters.
[time=1088] In verse 9, there is this understanding that masters are to treat their slaves a particular way. And then finally, the whole chapter concludes with how we are to be in relationship to the evil ones, Satan, as he has mentioned there in verse 12.
[time=1103] So with that as kind of an understanding of the flow of this thing, look then at verse 22, and understand that I read these words with a little fear and trepidation because of the milieu and the culture of our day
[time=1118] where wives and women have been so mistreated and have been
[time=1124] failed to be loved as they ought to be loved and how men have hidden behind either this verse or kind of a cultural understanding that suppresses women and all that they're supposed to be.
[time=1135] And so I don't even like to really read this verse in public because I know that everybody hears it through the wrong filter, the filter of what we've seen in our culture, which I adamantly disagree with.
[time=1145] I don't think what you're seeing in our culture is at all biblical.
[time=1148] I'm saying in the way that women have been oppressed and failed to be loved by their husbands. But let me read it anyway.
[time=1155] Verse 22, "Wise be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord."
[time=1163] Now if anything close to a relationship of a man and his dog
[time=1170] comes into your mind when you read this verse, you don't have a clue of what God is calling for when he says, "Wise be subject to your husbands." If anything close comes to your mind of somebody saying, "Wise it," and the dog does, there is nothing in the Word of God that would support a man being in a position of domination as a despot, commanding and demeaning and ruling and authoritatively directing the behavior of his wife. That is a foreign concept of the New Testament.
[time=1200] It's not biblical. It's not what this is talking about.
[time=1204] Submission consists, I say it this way of a woman, warmly responding and meaningfully supporting a man's involvement in his life.
[time=1216] Let me say that again. Submission or to be in subject consists of a woman warmly responding and meaningfully supporting a man's involvement in his life in a way that promotes godliness in his life.
[time=1232] Let me say it to you this way. There are two people inside of a marriage,
[time=1238] as you know, one's a husband, one's a wife, and God has given authority to each of them.
[time=1244] God has given authority to the man, as we noted in our previous message, to love his wife self-sacrificially with deep understanding.
[time=1253] He has given authority to the husband to use what he is to minister to his wife and complete what is lacking in her. God has also given authority to the wife.
[time=1266] God has given authority to the wife to respond to her husband
[time=1272] in ways that honor God and promote godliness in his life.
[time=1279] That's why if you go up from verse 22, you look at verse 21 for a minute, there's this note that says, "And be subject to one another in the fear of Christ." It's not that one person is having to be subject to another person, it's that God has designed the male in such a way that he most effectively ministers
[time=1298] by leading and loving in an understanding way, by being the pursuer, by being the initiator, by being the one who is, in fact, held accountable by God to set the pace of that relationship and the pace of that home.
[time=1312] That's consistent with the way that God designed that man.
[time=1314] And so God authorizes, gives authority, and the scriptures never talk about authority inside the Christian arena as the ability to be a despot or to rule.
[time=1325] Authority is always the authority to serve.
[time=1328] That's what Jesus Christ said, "I have come not to be served, but to serve, and to give my life a ransom." Uniquely, the woman has been created differently in God's design.
[time=1339] And so he has given her authority inside the relationship to do something different than the man, and it is to respond to him.
[time=1347] But it is not a passive response, it is not a mindless response, it is not a puppy dog response, it is an informed, intelligent, strong response that is designed to promote godliness in the life of her husband.
[time=1361] So as we just lay that down, then let's go a little further in our thinking.
[time=1368] And you obviously then would recognize that there are going to be two kinds of scenarios in which a woman is going to have to respond, basically.
[time=1376] One scenario is where the husband is godly, he is born again, and he is pursuing the Ephesians 5 concept, loving his wife as Christ loved the church.
[time=1386] That's going to be a blessed place for a woman to live, because the man is functioning as God designed him, and the woman is functioning in response to that, and there are going to be all kinds of fruit and joy unspeakable inside that design.
[time=1399] Unfortunately, most women in our day, many women in our Christian communities
[time=1406] are living in the other category, where the husband, though he may be a Christian, maybe he isn't a Christian, is not seeking to give his life to win
[time=1416] and to prove and to perfect and to mature his wife.
[time=1421] He has gone on to other things.
[time=1424] Interestingly, the Bible covers both categories, both categories.
[time=1429] In Ephesians 5, the woman is being supported, if we took time to look at verse 23 and 24 and 25, by a husband who is loving her as Christ loved the church.
[time=1440] The other condition I talked about, where the husband isn't doing that, is found in 1 Peter chapter 3, and we just need to go there for a moment.
[time=1448] If you take a look there, 1 Peter chapter 3, and hear the word of God addresses the situation where a woman is called to respond
[time=1459] to a man who is not living according to the will of God, a man who is in sin, a man who is sinful, a man who is selfish, a man who isn't pursuing as God had intended him to do.
[time=1474] What's it say there, 1 Peter chapter 3 verse 1?
[time=1477] In the same way, you wives be submissive to your own husbands, so that even if any of them are disobedient to the word, they may be one without a word by the behavior of their wives.
[time=1490] What is her response? I mean, what is her role in this?
[time=1493] It is how she responds that God will hold her accountable.
[time=1496] God will never hold her accountable for the direction of the home, for the maturity of her husband, for his obeying the word of God, for how the home has framed the children.
[time=1506] That is not what God is going to hold her accountable for.
[time=1509] He's going to hold her accountable for how she responds to a man, even who is disobedient.
[time=1515] Verse 4, well, excuse me, first verse 2, the chaste and respectable behavior is part of that response.
[time=1524] And then verse 4, let it not be the hidden person of the heart, so he's looking for an internal response with the imperishable quality of a gentle and a quiet spirit which is precious in the sight of God.
[time=1541] So even when the husband fails to love as he ought, God calls the woman to exercise her authority to respond to his disobedience in a way that is chaste and respectable, which is highlighted by a gentle and a quiet spirit, and then he sums it up and says, and when you do that, ladies, it's precious in my sight.
[time=1564] It's absolutely gorgeous to me.
[time=1567] It thrills me to the core of my being, God would say.
[time=1573] So the man called to love with understanding.
[time=1579] The woman called to respond in love.
[time=1585] Well, now this would be our third message on marriage, and you've heard a lot of what I have to say about this, maybe more than you care to hear.
[time=1592] You've heard Paul Harvey, and the rest of the story, it's on its way.
[time=1600] I asked Heidi if she would be willing to help me with this message, because I think there are some things that come from her perspective that can be very beneficial to us as a church family.
[time=1614] And what we want to do is allow you to benefit from really the mistakes
[time=1622] that I certainly have made in the first five years of our marriage just gross, blatant misplacement of my heart.
[time=1630] And then these remaining, I guess, seven years of marriage, seven or eight, where God has turned a corner in our life and by his grace, we're beginning to taste a little something along the lines of intimacy and fellowship and communion as I think God designed it.
[time=1647] So we invite you to look in at our life and our failures and our struggles and a few successes, and we trust that you'll connect with this in different ways that will move you as couples in thought-provoking ways,
[time=1665] and maybe even give hope to some of the marriages that are kind of stuck in the mud.
[time=1670] So let's roll the tape back on this thing a little bit.
[time=1672] I met Heidi when we were in the fourth grade.
[time=1676] I try to convince her that she fell madly in love with me at that moment and it has been ever since.
[time=1681] She adamantly denies it, says it wasn't until much, much later in life that that occurred.
[time=1687] I do remember buying her in sixth grade on slave day, you remember that?
[time=1693] I paid $3.50 for the woman, and she worked very hard all day.
[time=1700] She since become a lot more expensive.
[time=1704] I became incredibly attracted to Heidi in high school.
[time=1712] She had a very, very successful high school career.
[time=1715] In fact, she was voted by the student body as most likely to succeed.
[time=1718] She's very strong in her academics enjoyed a wonderful athletic career playing varsity tennis and later running there on the high school track team and eventually went to the University of Santa Barbara at California, a very large university in California and ran track for them, broke several records in her career there.
[time=1739] Eventually gave that up in her third year of college because of a love that she had for Germany and German literature.
[time=1745] Her parents are European and her mom is German, and so Heidi went to the University of Gertigen, where she studied German literature for a year in German.
[time=1754] Think about that for a minute, and was preparing to be a teacher of German literature.
[time=1759] The striking thing that took me over the edge was, and still is,
[time=1765] her character and her commitment to Christ.
[time=1769] When she was 17, still running on the high school team there at the Santaier's Valley Union High School, the campus crusade for Christ, athletes in action came and presented the gospel, and Heidi's heart was soft to that, and she prayed to receive Christ as a personal learning savior and continued to grow in that in a wonderful way.
[time=1788] I can honestly say to you that by the time we began dating officially there in the first couple of years of college,
[time=1794] I not only deeply loved her, but she was my best friend and the one I would rather spend time with than anybody on the face of the earth.
[time=1802] Like Russell said, we grew up together, we actually lived around the block from each other, and when we went away to college, Russell went an hour north, and I went an hour south, and we would study hard all week long so that on the weekend we could come home and play.
[time=1817] We would spend hours on the tennis court with his sister Cheryl and his brother-in-law Alan,
[time=1823] and time with our families having barbecues together, and when we would sneak a few minutes away, we would spend time thinking about our first year of marriage.
[time=1831] We envisioned ourselves being seniors at USC, and we'd jump on our bikes and ride over to the Coliseum and watch SC play football,
[time=1841] and we'd have picnics on the lawn and just have a nice day together, and sometimes we'd go to our classes.
[time=1847] (Laughter) But boy was I in for a surprise.
[time=1852] Rude Awakening might be a better way to put it, she's very gracious there.
[time=1857] Within two or three months of our wedding date, a very strong and powerful shift occurred inside of my heart, a sinful shift, a wrong shift that caused a lot of pain for Heidi N for me.
[time=1870] I suddenly became almost addicted to my academic pursuit, as meager as that was realizing that I felt God's call on my life and knew that even after college I'd have a Master's degree program to pursue, and I wanted to get myself up to speed in those kinds of areas.
[time=1887] And then I was asked to come on staff at Grace Community Church within the first three or four months of our marriage, and they only intended for me to work 20 hours a week, I would consistently work 40 hours a week, and these things became the consuming passion of my life.
[time=1904] They were, as you understand, good activities, nothing necessarily immoral in the behavior itself,
[time=1911] but I had no idea of what the shift in my heart away from her and into my pursuits,
[time=1919] the pain that it was beginning to cause her.
[time=1923] It's true he was unaware of what it was doing to me, but I certainly was aware of what was happening.
[time=1928] With his schedule in mind, I was thoroughly overwhelmed.
[time=1933] I was commuting from USC over to UCLA, I had 21 units, I did the grocery shopping,
[time=1939] the cooking, the cleaning, the wash, I handled the finances, or the lack thereof.
[time=1945] And in addition to the household responsibilities, I tried to share in his ministry that included Wednesday night,
[time=1952] all day Sunday, day activities, and weekend retreats.
[time=1956] And then on top of all that, I got pregnant five weeks into our marriage.
[time=1961] And then this whole scenario was made even more difficult when you realize that I had just left a very supportive family
[time=1968] in the beautiful Sanías Valley, and I moved to downtown LA, culture shock.
[time=1973] I went from UCSB, where I was well known as an athlete, to UCLA, where I knew no one, and no one knew me.
[time=1981] And then I tried to fit in his world at Grace Community Church, where he had already been a year and was well established.
[time=1987] I was known as Russell's wife.
[time=1991] After I graduated from UCLA, and just a couple weeks before our first child was born, I was at a staff wives gathering, about 30 staff wives from Grace Church.
[time=2000] And it was a question and answer with Pat McArthur.
[time=2003] And naively I asked a question, I said, "How do all of you deal with your husband's busy schedules?"
[time=2009] And Pat didn't respond, but another lady did, and she said, "Honey, you just get bitter." And I was a gas, but you know sure enough, I started to become angry, and I started to become bitter.
[time=2021] And although I knew it was sinful to be angry, it felt a whole lot better than the pain I was feeling.
[time=2028] To my continued shame in this whole process, I was oblivious to a couple of really, really important things.
[time=2036] The first was that while the grades and the ministry were good things in and of themselves,
[time=2043] I really believe the motive in my heart had nothing to do with God or glorifying God or trying to prepare to serve people.
[time=2051] I believe I was being driven, and I'm responsible for that, but being driven by a fear of failure,
[time=2060] and now married and being responsible to provide for the family.
[time=2064] It wasn't a love of God and love of people, it was an effort to prove myself and to distinguish myself
[time=2070] on a staff of 30 other pastors, and it was, I think, very unpleasing in the sight of God.
[time=2077] And all the hard work and all the long hours could not be considered anything for the glory of God.
[time=2082] You know, you read about Believer's works burning there at the Bhima seed.
[time=2085] I think those five years are already in smoke because of the motive of my heart being for me and my own success.
[time=2093] The second thing I was clueless of was that the anger that I would begin to see in Heidi from time to time,
[time=2099] I just pretty much attributed to her and her problem.
[time=2103] And really didn't understand that it was me who was fueling the anger by failing to play my role in her life as a loving person with understanding,
[time=2114] bringing my resources to bear on her soul.
[time=2117] And the absence of that, there was incredible pain and loneliness and emptiness that would wrongly,
[time=2123] but nevertheless burst forth and expressions of anger, but I thought that was something that she had to deal with, not something that I probably was responsible for.
[time=2133] That was very comfortable in justifying my absenteeism by my demanding schedule, by the things I felt I was supposed to do.
[time=2141] But frankly, no matter what I say about it now, or what I said about it then, changes the fact that I was wrong, that my wife was alone, and she was hurting, and I was failing.
[time=2153] The most frustrating thing for me was trying to get Russell to understand what was going on inside of me.
[time=2162] There was no way that I could go up against Russell in a discussion.
[time=2167] He's too strong in his mind, he's too quick, and he's also too articulate.
[time=2172] And so no matter what the circumstances, it almost always worked out to be my fault.
[time=2177] And if he apologized, it just seemed to be superficial. So when he'd ask, "What's wrong?"
[time=2184] I'd try to stuff it way down deep inside of me, and I'd say, "Oh, nothing. Oh, nothing at all."
[time=2190] And then finally, I'd explode, and I'd have a list three weeks long of all the things he'd done to hurt me,
[time=2197] and they'd be in chronological order.
[time=2200] Technicolor. In technicolor.
[time=2203] Which is horrible because this only confuses the issues.
[time=2207] All I wanted was for him to understand how I felt. I was lonely.
[time=2211] I wanted to experience the same friendship that we had when we were dating.
[time=2216] And he also made me feel inadequate. I was no longer enough to hold his attention.
[time=2223] Nevertheless, I felt guilty about my bitterness. I couldn't understand why I couldn't cope,
[time=2229] and why I wasn't enough to meet the demands.
[time=2232] I wanted to be godly. I was in an accountability group with four other women, one of which was Russell's older sister.
[time=2238] We memorized the book of James. I spent time in the Word in prayer every day, and I discipled young ladies.
[time=2245] But still, I struggled with my anger. I wanted God to fix my life.
[time=2251] How do you really was trying hard? And as you can hear, those are pretty staggering efforts on her part
[time=2258] to try to get those things under control.
[time=2261] The problem was we didn't understand the dynamics going on inside of our relationship.
[time=2266] And without that understanding and without the ability then to seek each other's forgiveness
[time=2272] and to repent in meaningful ways, not just of words that might have been said, but from a direction that a heart had taken, a detour that had left,
[time=2282] it was very difficult for us to find our way back to each other.
[time=2287] We continued to distance ourselves, and the most interesting part in all of this
[time=2294] is as our relationship would continue to deteriorate, so would our relationship with God.
[time=2301] And there seemed to be an increasing distance with Him as well as with each other.
[time=2308] I remember being in a car and we were having one of our discussions, and I said, "Russell, whatever happened to the twinkle in our eye?" You know, that couple, Ray and Barbara Brown, they're from Grace Church, and they have been married over 20 years or so, and I said, "They still have that claim. What's happened to us?" Well, I'm thinking, "Okay, you want to talk about a twinkle in somebody's eye?" Maybe they take a lot of vitamins. They have, like, glossy...
[time=2333] (Laughter) Absolutely clueless.
[time=2338] I'm thinking, "What does that have to do with anything we're talking about?" Well, it's a twinkle in somebody's eye, and of course, you look back on that.
[time=2345] It's a very, very perceptive thought.
[time=2347] You can tell when there's a connection happening, and you can tell when there's freshness, and you can tell when there's intimacy, and you can see it, and you can see the absence of it in a particular couple.
[time=2357] Well, by this time now, we're five years into our marriage, and I'm not catching on.
[time=2363] I'm continuing to ascribe these problems to Heidi.
[time=2366] I'm continuing to nobly, as a knight, pursue my ministry and pursue my education, or so I thought of myself.
[time=2374] God has a way, however, of getting our attention, and He did that in my life with two key events that we want to describe to you.
[time=2381] The first was at a college retreat that I was invited to speak at.
[time=2386] By this time, we had two children, and I was seven months pregnant, and also was to be gone the following week at a staff retreat.
[time=2394] So the way He sold me on this college weekend retreat was He said that, "Hey, it's in Santa Barbara.
[time=2401] "That's what we did all our dating.
[time=2403] "This will be a great time for you and I to walk on the beach "and go to our favorite restaurants and have good time together, "and they're providing babysitting.
[time=2410] "Someone will be taking care of your two girls." And I only have to speak at the main sessions.
[time=2416] I bought it, but in actuality, it turned out to be much different than what He had said.
[time=2422] On a Friday afternoon in the heat of the summer in LA, I packed our things, rustles, packed the car and went to his office, and there I waited with the girls outside for an hour while he tidied up a few things.
[time=2434] And then as I drove the car and took care of the children, he reviewed his messages.
[time=2440] And the plan was when we got there that we would unpack and get settled and go out to dinner with the children as a family.
[time=2447] The moment we arrive, his college buddies come up and say, "Hey, Russ, let's go for pizza." So Russ goes, "Come on, we jump in the car, we go down into town and we have pizza."
[time=2459] He plays video games, I sit at the table with two little children.
[time=2462] We can move on to that next point now.
[time=2464] Yeah.
[time=2465] Then it gets better, it gets better.
[time=2468] I think we're running short on time.
[time=2472] We return to the camp and of course we're late now, so he runs off to prayer meeting and I unpack the car and settle the children in
[time=2483] and go to the session alone.
[time=2486] And for the first time in my life, I walk in and I can't control myself.
[time=2492] I start to cry and I can't stop.
[time=2494] So I leave and I walk around the campus of this college and I'm crying out to God.
[time=2499] I don't know what's going on.
[time=2501] And the whole rest of the camp, I did not attend.
[time=2505] I couldn't handle it.
[time=2508] I was nowhere near an emotional breakdown, but I was scared.
[time=2515] Because I wasn't so much pain, I couldn't maintain that public image and the tears they just kept coming.
[time=2522] I was scared too, but to my own shame, I wasn't really scared about what was happening to my wife.
[time=2529] I was scared about my public image and what in the world my wife can't come to the sessions
[time=2536] and where is she and she's in tears.
[time=2538] And while a lot of people didn't know that, I was terrified that somebody would figure that out.
[time=2544] I was also afraid because I was unable to continue to manipulate her like I had in the past.
[time=2550] All my little pep talks, all my little, it's going to get better, all the promises of change in the future.
[time=2556] They just were falling on deaf ears and a hard heart, understandably so.
[time=2562] Nothing worked and I just wasn't able to get through throughout the course of this weekend.
[time=2569] So at the end of the weekend, still wrongly and foolishly assuming that this whole thing was her problem
[time=2575] and realizing I had reached the limit of my abilities to cope with it, I instructed her to go find some counseling.
[time=2583] Now, at this point, I probably need to share with you some words that I had shared with Heidi on June 6, 1980.
[time=2591] And this will highlight just how far I had drifted away.
[time=2596] There were a lot of people there, it's called a wedding.
[time=2599] Heidi, before God, our families and our friends, I now commit my life to you as your husband.
[time=2607] I will lay down my life for you and unconditionally love you just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.
[time=2616] I will always consider your needs as more important than mine and devote myself toward your growth, your love and your understanding of Christ.
[time=2627] I will strive to understand you and openly communicate my heart with you.
[time=2632] Heidi, I will be content in loving you alone and I promise to never leave you no matter how great the trials or the problems.
[time=2642] Well, we came home from camp and being pregnant, I went for a prenatal visit and the doctor said something was wrong and so he sent me to a specialist
[time=2651] and the specialist determined that the baby was suffering from growth retardation, which is directly related to the stress that I was under.
[time=2660] So I spent the next month and a half in bed under the doctor's orders.
[time=2664] Kelly was born and she was born very healthy, which we're very thankful for.
[time=2669] After her birth, I sought counsel as Russell had instructed me to do.
[time=2673] I sought out one of the pastor's wives at Grace Community Church.
[time=2677] She was very compassionate and she said, "Yes, life is hard, but your husband's called into the ministry."
[time=2686] And it's okay for him not to pursue you as the passion of his heart because he's doing the Lord's work.
[time=2692] And think on your blessings, think of your children, your healthy new baby and the supportive family you have.
[time=2699] Be thankful for the ministry that your husband's in.
[time=2703] Though naively, I tried to follow her advice at that time.
[time=2707] I've since come to realize how superficial and damaging her advice really was.
[time=2714] So I gave on the hope of ever really knowing true intimacy and marriage with Russell.
[time=2719] And I moved into a survival mode.
[time=2721] Where I was trying to protect myself and to minimize the pain, I played the role.
[time=2726] We had a brand new house. I decorated it. I threw myself into my children and my new baby.
[time=2732] And what I'm trying to say here is that at this point, I was living in denial.
[time=2738] I was shut down trying to replace the lack of Russell's love with other things.
[time=2744] Through this new survival mode, I had regained my composure.
[time=2748] I could now move in and out of public circles quite easily.
[time=2752] And we were gaining on that thing called coexistence.
[time=2756] But beneath the facade, I was still angry.
[time=2759] I felt no passion or freedom in my relationship with God.
[time=2763] And I had no softness in my heart for Russell.
[time=2766] My response was sinful, selfishly trying to minimize my hurt.
[time=2773] Second major event that the Lord used in our lives is what we refer to now as the empty embrace.
[time=2782] It was back at our home in Valencia and we were together spending some alone time together
[time=2788] and we were in an embrace.
[time=2790] And while it was obvious that Heidi had her arms around me and she was squeezing my body at some level, you know, I mean we were hugging, nobody was home.
[time=2802] She wasn't there. There was nothing coming from another human being.
[time=2806] There was just a physical hug there that was void of all the things you're really looking for in a hug which is connection with another person.
[time=2813] And it struck me as odd and I backed away from the embrace and said, "Honey, where have you gone?"
[time=2823] And there was a long pause as we both began to realize that we were a long, long way away from each other.
[time=2831] Heidi eventually said, "I do not know where I have gone."
[time=2837] I thought I could solve this problem finally recognizing that I was a part of it.
[time=2842] And some at that point even I think I gave myself only a minor part of this problem that I could change this by just changing my schedule.
[time=2849] And if I would just work less and come home more, then we'd work through all of these things and we'd be back on a path of intimacy.
[time=2857] That, however, didn't work so good.
[time=2862] No, it's true. He was home more physically but emotionally and mentally he was still at work
[time=2868] and it only made the matter worse and so I said, "Why don't you go back to work?" And he said, "Okay." And he did.
[time=2874] You know, I never minded that Russell worked hard. In fact, I respected that in him.
[time=2880] I wasn't looking for him to spend excess amount of time with me.
[time=2884] All I wanted was his heart.
[time=2886] Still in school here a little bit finishing up my education,
[time=2893] I was required to take some classes in counseling, Christian counseling, to complete the seminary degree.
[time=2898] They gave us an option to opt out of the courses that the seminary provided and allow us to attend seminars that had been pre-approved by the seminary itself.
[time=2906] And one of those was conducted by Dr. Larry Krab from the Institute of Biblical Counseling, which used to be just down the street and went on a lake at Grace Theological Seminary.
[time=2916] The Krab Ministry was coming to Los Angeles and I was allowed to attend that and to complete credits there for an entire week.
[time=2923] That without question was the turning point in my life on a relational basis.
[time=2929] It was through his teaching and through his approach to the scriptures and to the Word of God that I finally dawned on me that the true litmus test of Christianity is not my behavior.
[time=2941] It's not even my discipline and my dedication to pursue good grades, to learn things about the Bible, or to be running all around the world trying to help people in ministry from a performance advantage point.
[time=2953] That Christianity is fundamentally at the core how we treat one another.
[time=2959] First Timothy 1-5, that verse there finally dawned on my consciousness during that week, which says the goal of all of our instruction is love from a pure heart.
[time=2969] That's the Apostle Paul writing a pastor to another pastor, Timothy, saying this whole thing we're doing here, Timothy, all the instruction, all the teaching, all the laboring in the Word of God, if it doesn't produce mature relationships, godly relationships, we're not doing our job, we've missed the mark.
[time=2985] As those things began to open up, then the study that I had been involved in, I started to look at the Bible in a completely different way and could track God's commitment to relationship from Genesis to Revelation, and as I learned more about the Bible, it would seem to come out even in greater print with, hopefully, a continued stronger impact on my life.
[time=3009] The first time in six years of marriage, I could see in him genuinely that he was excited about our relationship.
[time=3017] Though I was skeptical at first because of what had happened in the past, I could honestly say that I saw a ray of hope.
[time=3025] God was at work in his heart. He was beginning to repent.
[time=3029] We weren't talking about minor adjustments.
[time=3033] He wasn't trying to appease me by changing little bad habits.
[time=3037] I could actually say something inside of him was moving towards me.
[time=3041] The response from Heidi was delightful.
[time=3045] I didn't deserve that. It'd taken me five years to beat her up.
[time=3049] I didn't deserve a quick response, and by beat her up, I obviously mean emotionally in my lack of love.
[time=3057] Exclusively, there was no physical violence or verbal abuse.
[time=3061] But she responded, and she responded fast, and she responded in ways that I did not deserve. I began to feel an emotional connection coming back into the core of our relationship. I began to feel those feelings that are so wonderful in the heart of a man that you get the notion that your life really delights to be in your presence and appreciates who you are and what you are and what you're doing, and the respect that she then gave to the rest of the ministry began to fill my heart, recognizing that it was no longer a threat to her because first things were dealt with first, our relationship, and then the ministry could be something she could actually enjoy and be proud of me in, which deeply touched my heart. She began to soften and started to respond in truly loving ways.
[time=3109] Over the past seven years, I have felt that Lord slowly rebuilding my sense of well-being through Russell's love. I can tell you what a wonderful feeling it is to know that he now not only enjoys spending time with me, but has even begun to take pleasure in me. Though there are still moments days, even weeks, when Russell can fall back into old patterns when he is selfishly preoccupied, and though I too can revert back to my survival tactics, by God's grace we have found that path of intimacy, and we're helping each other walk on this path called love. One of the greatest things that I could ever hear my wife say is that she's convinced or becoming convinced and beginning to sense that I'm actually delighted in who she is as a person. Instead of even he likes to spend time with me or he appreciates what I do and the hard work, when she starts saying things like I feel like he appreciates me.
[time=3173] I believe that we're beginning to experience some of the things that were designed there in marriage. We don't anyway want to try to suggest that because of a conference we went to and because of a Bible verse that came clear, that our life is now just on Easy Street relationally. We still struggle to fight for intimacy. We still struggle to stay out of coexistence and as Heidi has said, we can find ourselves back in that mode for weeks at a time, but we are thankful that by God's grace and the help of other people, there has been some skills that have been learned to try to move us productively back towards each other. We do know a level of love and a level of community and fun that we never had known even in our early innocent dating days and the first several weeks of marriage. I just want to draw this into a conclusion by saying a couple things to you.
[time=3237] Some of you are here today and have experienced so much hurt by talking both the men and women that the prospect of becoming vulnerable again scares you to death and you'd rather die. I want to tell you based upon the word of God that the spirit of God is able to put you back together and to restore your hope and to allow you to enjoy life again in meaningful relationships.
[time=3269] I cannot promise you that both partners will participate in this.
[time=3273] I cannot promise that your husband will repent and soften and pursue. And you men, I cannot promise that your wives will begin to respond as it says in first Peter with a gentle and a quiet spirit which is pleasing to God.
[time=3289] I can promise you even in the event that they don't respond.
[time=3293] That if you'll set your focus on trying to be in relationship in the right way handling your side of the equation you can feel a significance and a sense of well-being in your life that you will never know independent of that concentrated effort on being what you're supposed to be a healthy relational human being.
[time=3313] I also want to say that I believe when I read the New Testament in particular there's a level of fellowship there that is staggering the level of intimacy in community and commitment, mutual commitment one with another.
[time=3325] And I am concerned with the evangelical church in America today that defines fellowship basically as a cup of coffee, a donut, a how are you and how are the kids we'll see you next week.
[time=3337] I believe we can do better than that. I believe that we can train each other. I believe that we can implement ministries that are solely designed to allow men to more meaningfully relate to men and what women with women and couples together. I believe that our souls need that kind of regular maintenance and accountability at the real issue core level of our life and that coming and hearing a message as good as that is and involved in some level of fellowship as good as that is really isn't God's designed for the redeemed community. And we're hopeful that some of these types of ministries as God allows us would be able to become a major part of our experience here.
[time=3385] Well, thanks Heidi for helping.
[time=3389] Let's have a word or pray together.
[time=3403] While it was a pleasure to have our special musical guest from Cedarville College, the swordbearers, ministering to you in song this morning. The message was from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore and it was a privilege to have his wife along this morning as she shared some of the ministry that they have together.
