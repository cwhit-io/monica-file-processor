[time=13] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=19] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=21] Thank you for joining us.
[time=22] Today is the fourth and final message by Pastor Moore in his series on the subject of marriage.
[time=28] Getting into conflict in marriage is a lot easier than getting out of it.
[time=33] Why does it seem that sometimes even the most incidental little issue can grow from a small ripple to a raging storm on the sea of conflict?
[time=41] And before we know it, tension fills the room, walls go up, and we're often another painful trek into the darkness of harsh words, cold isolation and lonely nights.
[time=50] For many, this process seems to repeat itself so often that it threatens to be an unbreakable pattern.
[time=57] What can be done to help us learn how to handle our conflicts and more constructive and less painful ways?
[time=64] Well, there are no easy answers, but today Pastor Moore leads us in a discussion he calls the ABCs of Conflict Resolution.
[time=73] Our special music today will be presented by Denise Mitchell.
[time=76] [MUSIC]
[time=83] Let's join our sanctuary choir and orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=88] [MUSIC - 142 seconds]
[time=248] [APPLAUSE]
[time=252] Well, hello there and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=255] We're thankful that you've joined us today, and we're also, as I'm sure you are, thankful that spring is finally here.
[time=261] We no longer have to take that by faith.
[time=263] It actually looks and feels like spring.
[time=265] It's wonderful to see the sun out and to receive an occasional rain and to enjoy the clouds as they pass through and even play a little bit of golf.
[time=275] I trust that you're enjoying this wonderful weather as even we anticipate the fun we're going to have this summer.
[time=281] Well, today we come to the last in our series of four messages on marriage, Marriage God's Way, and I'm thankful that the series has been as well received as it has.
[time=293] We've just received a lot of positive feedback from the people in our church and from many of you who watched the Bible Hour, and we're excited for that.
[time=301] We just want to let you know that you can buy tapes of the messages if that interests you, whether cassette tapes or actual video tapes, not of the entire Bible Hour program, but of the messages themselves.
[time=316] Those have all been edited together into two tapes, all four messages into two tapes.
[time=321] And you can buy those by calling our church, either the cassettes or the video, and order those, and we'll take your name and address and then send them to you as soon as we have them ready.
[time=332] So we encourage you to do that if there's a friend you'd like to pass that along.
[time=336] Well, today, let's resume now in the normal portion of our program and move to message number four.
[time=343] The poem is really where the heart is.
[time=352] Then home must be a place we all can share.
[time=360] For even with our different sets, our hearts are much the same.
[time=368] And where love is, we come together there.
[time=376] Wherever there is laughter ringing, someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there.
[time=388] Love will be our home, wherever there are children singing.
[time=397] Where a tender heart is being, we can live together there.
[time=404] Love will be our home.
[time=414] With love, our hearts can be a family.
[time=422] And hope can bring this family face to face.
[time=430] And though we may be far apart, our hearts can be as one.
[time=438] For love brings us together in one place.
[time=446] Wherever there is laughter ringing, someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there.
[time=458] Love will be our home, where there are words of kindness spoken.
[time=466] Where a vow is never broken, we can live together there.
[time=474] Love will be our home, love will, love will be our home.
[time=504] Love will, love will be our home, wherever there is laughter ringing, someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there.
[time=525] Love will be our home, wherever there are children singing.
[time=534] Where a tender heart is being, we can live together there.
[time=541] Love will be our home, love will, love will be our home.
[time=571] Love will, love will be our home, wherever there is laughter ringing, someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there.
[time=591] Love will be our home, love will be our home.
[time=621] Too bad she can't sing, huh? Good night. That was beautiful. She's beautiful.
[time=629] Well, as we take out the topic of conflict resolution, I guess one of the greatest concerns that I have about church in America today is that we almost promote a superficiality.
[time=646] We almost promote because of our desire to rejoice in the Lord always and to gain the victory in Christ and to stress the fact that we have all the resources that we need to live godly lives by virtue of regeneration.
[time=661] That it almost becomes unacceptable to honestly and openly share the struggles and the hardships and the raw reality of life even as a Christian.
[time=674] And my great concern with that is that what we do then to each other is we push each other away into isolation.
[time=684] Whether we do that as individuals or even forcing couples into isolation and we rob ourselves the access to one of the most powerful change agents that God has given to the Christian, namely other believers who can really be connected with them in vital fellowship at points of genuine need.
[time=706] And so one of the things we've tried to accomplish or at least explore in this series has been to take the mask off a little bit and be a little more honest and a little more transparent and a little more open in the hopes that you would be encouraged by that, not only in your relationship with your spouse, but also with other couples as well that you might trust and build these kinds of relationships with.
[time=733] And we want to do a little more of that this morning.
[time=736] I'm thankful that Tim and Connie, Tim Teder is the youth pastor here at our church, have agreed this morning to help us get started into the topic of conflict resolution by sharing kind of an episode out of their own life.
[time=750] So Tim and Connie.
[time=756] I am nervous.
[time=757] This is my first time being a preacher at.
[time=761] I've listened to her with our five kids, she's had a lot of practice.
[time=765] But there are some things we want to make sure that we tell you about us and I wish we could say it without these notes.
[time=771] We spend a lot of time writing this down so we could be as clear and concise as possible, but sometimes it seems like we're reading this because we are, but this really is our story.
[time=781] For 14 years we've been married and for those 14 years I have served in the position of a couple church staffs first here in Blackhawk and then in Michigan previously.
[time=792] I think that because of my positions as associate pastors in the two churches that people have sometimes falsely assumed that our marriage was somehow uniquely blessed and that we avoided many of the problems and difficulties that plague other husbands and wives.
[time=810] But we face the same kind of struggles that everybody else faces and we haven't always handled them well.
[time=816] In fact, we thought it might help you to see what we have been learning about loving each other through conflict.
[time=822] And the best way to do that is to invite you to peek into one of our recent moments of tension.
[time=828] And it was a moment of tension.
[time=831] I'd been gone on a weekend speaking at a youth retreat in Upper Michigan and I took two of my sons along with me.
[time=837] So I had that weekend responsibilities of not only teaching the four sessions, but also to be a good dad to my boys.
[time=848] And it was a good weekend, but by the end of it I was physically and emotionally drained.
[time=852] Then after driving four and a half hours back home, I remember walking back into our house five o'clock that Sunday afternoon being very tired.
[time=862] And my agenda that afternoon was simply to relax and wind down.
[time=867] I was upstairs and I heard Tim come home.
[time=870] Now you have to understand that sometimes Tim can be a very critical person.
[time=874] No, I'm not.
[time=876] And I was already concerned that he would be upset with me about some things that had happened during the week.
[time=883] So I was already trying to come up with things in my defense.
[time=886] Here are some things that I was concerned about.
[time=888] He had left me with responsibilities in the youth hour that morning.
[time=892] Now I know how important that hour is for Tim and I felt like I had let him down in some ways or that he was going to be disappointed in the way things had gone.
[time=900] I also know that when he comes home from a trip he doesn't like the house to be too messy.
[time=904] Well my sisters had been with me that weekend and their children and somehow cleaning the house just was not on our list of fun things to do.
[time=912] I'm not kidding the house was pretty bad.
[time=915] And then there was this matter of this arbitron survey?
[time=918] I don't know if you know what an arbitron survey is, but Connie had agreed to participate in one.
[time=923] And that meant that we had to, well she had to keep written record of every turned on program on every television set in our home for the entire week, even if nobody was watching it.
[time=935] And so instead of encouraging her and holding her up and doing this I had spent most of the week cracking jokes at her and being critical of her inability to keep accurate records.
[time=947] That's true. Tim was on my case about that survey.
[time=951] I was so concerned about doing that survey right and proving to Tim that I could do it so when he would come home I could say I did it.
[time=959] I did not let anybody watch TV for three days while he was gone in my home.
[time=964] So that Sunday afternoon and evening we were both on edge but we just lived with the tensions into that night.
[time=973] And we went to bed without voicing our frustrations although we knew that the anger was there.
[time=978] We were too tired, probably too lazy to deal with it so we just went to sleep.
[time=982] Now this pattern wasn't really new to us.
[time=984] In fact it was typical of how we often dealt with conflict in our marriage.
[time=989] When I was angry with Connie I would usually pull away from her, I'd just clam up.
[time=994] My anger would be expressed by my walking away leaving her alone or by saying things to her that were cutting and critical.
[time=1001] I know that women respond differently to conflict.
[time=1004] I'm not a yeller, a screamer, or a thrower of things but instead I become very quiet and shut down.
[time=1010] And my nonverbal communication is loud and clear, it's a stay away from me.
[time=1014] And if you want to talk to me one grunt means yes, two grunts mean no.
[time=1019] Anything beyond that is very sarcastic but you know the inside of me I am yelling and screaming at him.
[time=1025] In the history of our marriage we've dealt with certain momentary issues and resolved conflict rather well I think.
[time=1032] But there have always been those certain basic issues that seem to cause a lot of hurt whenever they come up.
[time=1039] These we came to call the deeper issues.
[time=1043] Issues like my needs aren't a priority to you or you don't do the things that make me feel loved.
[time=1049] And I didn't feel like I was the most important person to you.
[time=1051] And when we wounded each other in any of these areas I mean our pattern was to hold our feelings inside.
[time=1056] Even thinking that this somehow was more spiritual.
[time=1059] To Connie's credit I'd have to say that she often tried to initiate conversation about these things but I usually found some way to avoid,
[time=1067] to get out of at least that level of conversation.
[time=1070] And we really never blew up at each other.
[time=1072] No and we'd even pretend that we were being spiritual and forgiving by not bringing up the issue and not getting angry about it.
[time=1079] Instead we'd get up the next day and go on pretending to forget the anger from the day before.
[time=1085] But we really didn't forget and we really didn't forget.
[time=1088] Our quietness did not draw us closer together.
[time=1091] Actually it kept us for real intimacy.
[time=1094] When we clam up we were selfishly protecting ourselves and not pursuing each other.
[time=1099] So when we went to bed that Sunday night we were just following our typical pattern.
[time=1104] Let's just go to sleep.
[time=1105] Maybe it won't be such a big deal in the morning.
[time=1108] But the anger was just too deep to ignore.
[time=1111] And the next day we were both expressing it in our own unique ways.
[time=1114] I was still hurting from the unresolved issues.
[time=1117] So it did not help on Monday when Tim criticized me for some of the things that I was doing around the home.
[time=1123] And I watched as the distance between Connie and me just grew greater during the day.
[time=1129] She became withdrawn, stubbornly quiet and she didn't want to have anything to do with me.
[time=1135] That night when it was time to go to bed I was hurt and I was shut down.
[time=1139] I got into bed, moved on my side of the bed.
[time=1142] It was almost as if there was an imaginary line down the middle of our bed.
[time=1146] And that line said do not cross.
[time=1149] I did not say a word, but inside I was screaming don't touch me.
[time=1154] Now you have to understand that I'd been gone on a retreat for a weekend.
[time=1158] And the first night home was a waste and I wanted to touch.
[time=1162] So in my typical pattern of great sensitivity I asked Connie something like, so what's your problem?
[time=1168] What? You really don't know how critical you've been of me today?
[time=1175] How do you take things too seriously? I was just pointing out a couple of things that you should have done differently.
[time=1180] Tim, you do that all the time.
[time=1183] You're just exaggerating again. It's not that bad. You make it worse than it is.
[time=1188] Tim, it is bad. Matter of fact, I think what I'm going to do is start to write down things.
[time=1192] That way I can show you so you can see how critical you have been.
[time=1196] That's really good. You can keep a list of all the times I'm critical of you.
[time=1199] And I'll keep a list of all the things I don't like about you.
[time=1201] At the end of the week, we'll compare lists and see who wins.
[time=1205] At that moment, much to my relief, our two-year-old woke up.
[time=1210] I was happy to go check on her. Matter of fact, I was eager to check on her.
[time=1214] I was hoping that she was really sick. I did not want to go back to our room.
[time=1218] When I went in there and found out she was fine, I even tried to talk her into being sick.
[time=1224] That didn't work. I knew I had to go back to our room.
[time=1227] Well, while Connie was gone, there was a battle that was going on inside of me.
[time=1233] I was so angry, I just wanted to go down to the basement and stay there for the night.
[time=1238] In fact, I got out of bed once or twice and headed towards the door.
[time=1241] You need to understand something about me. You're refusing to deal with our conflicts in a healthy way, had become a pattern.
[time=1249] I knew better. I knew the Bible said, "Don't let the sun go down while you're still angry." I knew the Bible says, "Forgive one another as Christ forgave you." The instruction to me as a husband was to love my wife the same way that Christ loved the church.
[time=1263] I was to love her deeply from the heart because love covers over a multitude of cents.
[time=1268] I knew I should do all those things, and yet as a husband, I had learned to love my wife superficially.
[time=1275] As the years of our marriage went by, I took her more and more for granted.
[time=1279] After 14 years of marriage, I knew her better, but I wasn't loving her better.
[time=1285] My agenda in our marriage was to make things work for me.
[time=1289] When an argument like this broke out between us, it made me angry, defensive.
[time=1294] First of all, because I knew that a lot of things that Connie brought up, her criticisms of me had an element of truth about them, and I felt guilty about that.
[time=1302] I was also angry because these arguments were an inconvenience to me.
[time=1306] I just wanted a marriage that would run smoothly and that would work, that would meet all my needs,
[time=1313] and these conflicts upset the order, and I blamed Connie for it.
[time=1318] I often would just roll over and go to sleep, or at least pretend that I was going to sleep, because I knew that Connie was in conflict and she wouldn't be able to sleep so easily, and so even that was an act of revenge to me.
[time=1331] But this night, I mean, it was even worse. Things had been building up, not just from this weekend, but it had been a pattern of things for the last couple months, and I was torn up inside.
[time=1340] I didn't just want to roll over and go to sleep, I wanted to leave the room, I wanted to get out of there.
[time=1344] But I didn't, and I think there were a couple of things that made me stay that night.
[time=1350] The first was a building frustration with what our marriage was becoming.
[time=1355] We were becoming a husband and wife who learned how to exist together and have a marriage that somehow worked, but we weren't learning how to really love each other.
[time=1366] I knew that God intended marriage to be something much more than we were experiencing.
[time=1372] And the second thing that helped make me stay was, it grew out of conversations I'd been having with friends recently.
[time=1379] We'd been talking about our need as husbands to pursue our wives out of the passions of our hearts.
[time=1386] And as angry as I was, I still felt ashamed.
[time=1391] I knew that as a husband, I had not been loving my wife.
[time=1398] The pattern of our marriage, not loving her in that way, and I was ashamed of that.
[time=1403] And I hadn't been doing it, but I wanted to.
[time=1407] I came back to the room and I saw Tim sitting up in bed.
[time=1410] Well, of course, I'm very sarcastic and say, Tim, you're not going to get me sleep that way.
[time=1414] Then I got into bed and I expected our usual routine.
[time=1417] That is, Tim goes to sleep, I stay awake and convince myself that this is how our marriage works.
[time=1424] Not this time. I can't remember everything I said.
[time=1428] But I know it started out something like this.
[time=1431] We've been married for almost 14 years and it seems like by now we should be able to get past some of this stuff.
[time=1439] I know some of the things you've been saying about me, not being a perfect husband, I know those things are true.
[time=1444] And I fail you in a lot of those ways.
[time=1447] And the ways I criticize you for not being a perfect wife, well, the point is there is no perfect husband, there is no perfect wife.
[time=1455] I fail, you fail, I know I'm too critical.
[time=1461] And the truth is the little things I criticize you about, I mean, they are nothing compared to the things that I've always loved you for.
[time=1468] I mean, you are the kind of mother that every kid would want.
[time=1472] You take care of yourself, you have a heart for God, you're the kind of person that other people really like being around.
[time=1478] And those are the things I still love about you.
[time=1480] In fact, if I could somehow go back 14 years, still knowing everything I know about you now, and I could do it all over again, I would still want you to marry me.
[time=1492] Well, it's very difficult for me to explain what I was feeling as Tim kept talking.
[time=1498] I know that my heart was melting.
[time=1500] I had just last out at Tim and he was responding to me in a very loving and caring way.
[time=1505] He had never taken control of a situation like that before.
[time=1509] I knew that he was telling me that he cared about the deeper issues of our marriage.
[time=1514] I knew that he was sincere in what he was saying.
[time=1517] If he could say that he could marry me again, knowing what he knew about me today, I knew that he loved me and cared.
[time=1524] We talked for a long time and then I erased that imaginary line from our bed.
[time=1529] Well, I'm sure we'll have more conflicts and there's going to be times when we are angry and we're selfish.
[time=1535] But I also know that things have been different in our marriage since that night.
[time=1539] And I know that we don't have to go back to the old pattern of doing things.
[time=1544] This is really a new expression of love for us.
[time=1547] And all we want to do is continue to grow in it.
[time=1550] Something awfully inviting in that, isn't there?
[time=1564] It just thrills my heart.
[time=1566] I want to be a part of that kind of relationship.
[time=1570] I want to be around those kinds of people.
[time=1572] I want that kind of honesty and vulnerability to mark my life.
[time=1577] I want those kinds of people looking into my life and asking me how I'm doing.
[time=1582] Because that's the heart of our Christianity.
[time=1587] Genuinely confessing our sins to each other and then pursuing each other and loving each other in such meaningful ways.
[time=1595] Thanks for sharing this.
[time=1598] I want to talk to you this morning in the time remaining about what I'm going to call the ABCs of conflict resolution.
[time=1606] And by calling them the ABCs, I don't mean to imply that conflict resolution can be simple,
[time=1612] can work out as well as it did for Tim and Connie in every instance.
[time=1616] That it's just a matter of following a few steps and presto everybody's enamored with each other and they're back in love.
[time=1623] I don't title it for that reason.
[time=1627] Instead, the ABCs, I'm hoping to give you a memory key, something very easy to remember.
[time=1632] So that when you are in the midst of conflict and your emotions are going wild and you are filled with rage and anger
[time=1639] and you're about ready to go back into the very destructive and harmful ways of conflict resolution that you no doubt learned from your parents
[time=1648] or have seen in other people, that you would have something readily available to draw upon and say,
[time=1655] "Wait a minute, I don't have to live like this.
[time=1658] I don't have to continue to treat my wife or my husband this way." Now, what was that thing again? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The ABCs, okay?
[time=1664] So each letter is a main point in my message and they're not real profound.
[time=1669] They're very difficult to do, very difficult to do, not very profound and I think very, very helpful.
[time=1677] The first one, the first letter A, stands for admit your sinful agenda.
[time=1683] The process begins in conflict resolution by admitting your sinful resolution.
[time=1689] And I'm only going to be here a minute so you don't need to turn.
[time=1692] But for your reference, I'm going to Matthew chapter 7. I'm going to read a few verses.
[time=1697] The Lord is referring to a situation of conflict and he says this, and why do you look at the speck that is in your brother's eye?
[time=1705] But do not notice the log that is in your own eye.
[time=1709] How can you say to your brother, "Let me take the speck out of your eye and behold, the log is in your own eye?"
[time=1715] You hypocrites. First, take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
[time=1725] The Lord is pretty clear. When it comes to resolving conflict, the place to start is not the other person's faults, not the other person's failures,
[time=1734] as real as those may be and as damaging as those failures may have been to you, that is still not the place to start in conflict resolution.
[time=1743] The beginning point is by looking at your own life and your own sin.
[time=1748] Another verse tells us that that sin is not to be superficially analyzed.
[time=1754] What did I say? What didn't I say? What did I do? What didn't I do?
[time=1758] The Word of God is constantly calling us to look at our motives, the inside desires and our heart.
[time=1765] James 4, let me read to you, James 4 1 and following says this, what is the source of your quarrels and conflicts among you?
[time=1773] You want to know where this stuff starts? You want to know where this stuff comes from?
[time=1776] You want to know why you're in a fight right now? Because is it not the source?
[time=1782] Excuse me, is not the source. Your pleasures that wage war in your members,
[time=1788] you lust could be said strongly desire and you do not have so you commit murder and you are envious and cannot obtain so you fight in quarrel.
[time=1797] Man, that's pretty straight.
[time=1800] 99% of the time that you and I find ourselves in a conflict with another person, you can be confident and assured that you are playing a part in this role in conflict
[time=1813] and that it has its root in your own selfishness.
[time=1817] It has its root in your own selfish desires.
[time=1822] And so the first step, I told you this was hard and not very profound, but the first step is to admit your selfish agenda.
[time=1831] Not really very easy to do. We are masters. We are skilled.
[time=1836] We are experts at justifying our own selfishness based upon other people's weaknesses.
[time=1845] We got this down to a point of reflex.
[time=1848] Listen to what one wife said in justifying her sinful behavior against her husband.
[time=1853] So it's gotten to the point where I can't take it anymore.
[time=1858] I've got to start thinking of myself. I am totally unhappy as your wife.
[time=1865] That was her justification for her sinful behavior against her husband.
[time=1870] In a different scenario, listen to a husband's words as he justifies his selfishness in regard to his wife.
[time=1877] After 26 years of no affection, I've had it.
[time=1882] If just once you would warmly reach over and show an interest in giving me pleasure,
[time=1888] I could make it in this marriage.
[time=1892] I hope you're sensing very clearly what both of these people are doing, which I think is common in my own life and probably in yours.
[time=1902] This notion now that I have reached a point, this has gone on long enough.
[time=1907] What you are doing has begun to exceed tolerable pain levels in my life.
[time=1913] And so I can now, based upon your failures, justify a sinful course of action in my own life.
[time=1920] A sarcastic word.
[time=1922] A shutting down of my own soul against you as I retreat into the safety of my own loneliness.
[time=1928] An unwillingness to pursue you, an unwillingness to ask your forgiveness, an unwillingness to make amends and try to get this thing back together, because you have pushed this thing too far, and it hurts me too much.
[time=1941] Here's what we do, and this is so subtle.
[time=1944] We regard our own hurt as the most important problem in the conflict.
[time=1952] We regard what has been done against us and the hurt that it has brought us to the most important part of the problem.
[time=1960] Whenever you hear yourself wanting to justify or explain your behavior based on the other person's failure to meet your needs, to meet your wants, or to meet your desires, frankly, you're in sin.
[time=1975] It's just that easy, and it's just that simple.
[time=1979] It may in fact be true that you have been legitimately hurt.
[time=1982] That happens all the time in relationships, even good relationships.
[time=1987] It may in fact be true that you have had unmet desires for affection, for emotional contact, for a level of common sensitivity.
[time=1996] That all may be very true.
[time=1999] It may also be true that you have been treated unfairly and possibly for an extended period of time.
[time=2007] But none of that is the most important part in this problem.
[time=2012] None of that is where the Lord would direct you to think first.
[time=2017] He wants you to understand that the most important issue that you are facing in this conflict is your sinful ability to justify your own selfishness rather than to seek forgiveness for what you've done wrong.
[time=2037] The most important thing that we need to do in a conflict is to assess our own sin, both behaviorally and motive,
[time=2047] and come with only one thing in mind to do which is to admit what we have done and ask forgiveness for it.
[time=2056] You'll know you're there at that point of reconciliation when instead of explaining what you did, you're admitting your sinfulness.
[time=2067] Instead of trying to explain your sinfulness, you're simply admitting your sinfulness.
[time=2073] And you'll know you're there at a point of real conflict resolution when instead of asking for understanding for your sin, you are simply asking to be forgiven for your sin.
[time=2086] Those will be the things that will show you internally that you are ready to move towards real genuine conflict resolution.
[time=2094] If you are hearing rumbling in your mind the explanations and the justification for your sin, and if you are justifying your sin in something to this nature, if that other person only "understood" how hard my life is, how deeply I have been hurt, how difficult things are, if only they understood instead of saying if only they could forgive me.
[time=2123] I received a letter from an elder this week who had absolutely no idea that we were going to talk about this stuff.
[time=2128] He was just sharing with me what God was doing in his heart.
[time=2131] I love it when that happens. It encourages me a great deal.
[time=2134] I want to thank a lot of you for the letters that have been coming in this series on marriage. This one goes this way.
[time=2140] I want to thank you for your message today.
[time=2143] I came away with the determination to monitor myself more closely
[time=2149] and to make every effort to cherish and treasure my wife even more.
[time=2156] I was convicted of how many times I have let my profession and my to-do list crowd out my wife.
[time=2165] At times we have existed together instead of living for one another.
[time=2170] Those times I now realize were largely my fault.
[time=2175] I have asked forgiveness from her and have made a new commitment to love her as she should be loved.
[time=2184] Man, I wish I could have been a fly on that wall.
[time=2188] You're talking about somebody who's dealing with God, not about their own disappointments and their own hurts and their own justifications and their own reasoning to perpetuate their continued sin in their life.
[time=2202] The violation of what God has clearly called them to do, we're talking here about a man who humbly stood before God and said, "This is my problem. These are my sins.
[time=2212] My sin is negatively impacting a woman I promise to cherish and love God.
[time=2217] Please forgive me." Then as fast as he could, I assume, the presence of his wife looking earnestly into her eyes and saying, "I have sinned against you, please forgive me."
[time=2231] Man, that's the beginning of conflict resolution that breeds true intimacy.
[time=2236] Anything short of that, it may work for you.
[time=2241] I'm not denying that these little negotiations can't work out where, "Well, I'm sorry for this, and I'm sorry for this, and you did this, and I did that, and we did this, and we did that," and we'll change this and this.
[time=2250] These weird little negotiation things that occur without bottom-line fundamental repentance,
[time=2256] those may work, but I'll guarantee you they will not move you towards true intimacy.
[time=2261] They are yet another step in the path of coexistence.
[time=2269] So, let me make a very practical suggestion, because this stuff I don't think happens on the run.
[time=2277] When you sense that you are in conflict or heading for conflict, and maybe by this time the walls have gone up and the lines have been drawn, and you're flaming upset at the situation, and you're wondering, you know, it's that feeling like, "Are we ever going to be able to talk again in a reasonable way?" I'd like to recommend that you find some time with your God, that you remove yourself from that situation, that you back away from it for a moment, and maybe with explanation, I'm not prepared to love you at this moment as I know I should,
[time=2313] and I'm not running away from this particular conflict, but I need to catch my breath here for just a second.
[time=2318] And I might recommend to you that you take a walk around the block, that you might find a lonely place with an open notebook and begin to wait on the Spirit of God, and pray to God, God help me see the log in my own eye.
[time=2331] Oh God, help me see the sinful, selfish desires that are producing the conflict known as fighting and quarreling that your word speaks about.
[time=2343] It may need to begin at a very fundamental level where you'll have to admit to him, you can't even sense it or see it because you're so committed to defending yourself.
[time=2350] It's been such a long time since you've taken on us to look at what you've been doing in your side of the equation, but I believe God will meet you there, and I believe as you are humble before him, he will bring you to a place of true repentance, to where you can honestly begin the conversation with the words please forgive me for,
[time=2373] and then you can list it off.
[time=2378] The letter B, the A, and then the B.
[time=2384] This one stands for bear the burden, bear the burden.
[time=2391] In another passage in the New Testament that talks about how to handle conflict, you don't need to turn there necessarily, but for your notes Galatians 6.
[time=2399] It says this, the context is when trespasses have occurred and somebody has been involved in sin and there's relational conflict going on and you're in the middle of a fight, it says in verse 2, bear one another's burdens and thus fulfill the law of Christ.
[time=2419] It goes on to say, for if anyone thinks he's something when he is nothing, he deceives himself, but let each one examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another. In other words, that's kind of a reiteration of the first point.
[time=2435] Examine your own work first.
[time=2439] The passage goes on, for each one shall bear his own load.
[time=2443] It can kind of sound contradictory.
[time=2445] In verse 2 it says bear one another's burdens and then at the end of the passage it says, for each one shall bear his own load and you're going, well, what's the plan?
[time=2453] Am I to help bear another person's burden or not?
[time=2456] Two different Greek words. When it says to bear another person's burden, the word for burden there is talking about an excessive weight, something that's too heavy for them, something that they can't legitimately carry on their own.
[time=2468] And we reach points in our Christian lives, and that's why I'm so concerned about the isolation that fills our churches, where we can be in sin and be under such a burden that we've brought even upon ourselves that we need help for somebody to move in and shoulder some of that load with us.
[time=2486] The other word down in verse 5, load, is a different Greek word.
[time=2490] Just talks about the normal, ordinary, average load that we can carry by ourselves.
[time=2497] Conflict resolution begins by admitting your own sinful agenda and secondly by being willing to bear the burden that the other person is feeling,
[time=2507] to shoulder up underneath the pressure that they are feeling.
[time=2511] The Lord is the perfect example of this. I want to just read to you a couple of instances in his life.
[time=2519] He's moving and ministering as he was known to do and multitudes were following him that says this.
[time=2527] And seeing the multitudes, he felt compassion for them because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd.
[time=2537] And then he prays that famous line that God would, the Lord of the harvest, would send workers into the harvest.
[time=2544] He's seeing this great multitude of people who should be repenting, who should be falling on their knees and worshiping him, but that's not what they're doing.
[time=2551] They're just following after him because they want to see another miracle.
[time=2554] They want another free lunch.
[time=2555] They want to see somebody else raised from the dead because it's a fascinating thing.
[time=2559] It's better than anything we've ever seen even in a movie.
[time=2561] It just would thrill your soul to see an actual miracle take place.
[time=2564] These were ancient thrill seekers who were following around a prophet who could do thrills all the time.
[time=2569] So they were really violating him.
[time=2571] They weren't really pursuing him and following him to learn and repent and acknowledge his worshipness.
[time=2576] They were just seeking thrills as the byproduct of his ministry.
[time=2582] And instead of rebuking them, and instead of feeling anger towards them, he looks behind the facade of their life.
[time=2591] And the scripture says he sees them as distressed and downcast.
[time=2596] Very powerful words seeing people in a position of hardship who are helpless in their condition.
[time=2605] And of course he knew that they had come to that place because of the false religious leaders of his day.
[time=2610] And they had preached these false religious leaders that you could get to heaven through your own works.
[time=2615] And they had bought into that.
[time=2617] And of course that was wrong.
[time=2618] And so he saw them as sheep who were distressed and downcast.
[time=2622] And it says he was moved with compassion.
[time=2626] That word could be translated tenderness.
[time=2630] He had eyes to see the true condition of their hurt and their sorrow and their soul.
[time=2637] And out of seeing that, it softened his heart.
[time=2641] And so came this great prayer that they could become saved.
[time=2646] Later in his ministry, a different scenario occurred.
[time=2652] And again he is moved with compassion.
[time=2656] Jesus called his disciples to him and said, I feel compassion for the multitude because they have remained with me now for three days and have nothing to eat.
[time=2665] And I do not wish to send them away hungry unless they faint on the way.
[time=2669] This time it's not an issue of their soul, it's just the basic physical condition that they were in.
[time=2673] They'd been with them for three days.
[time=2675] The provisions they had brought had long since been exhausted.
[time=2678] And if they were to leave at this point without proper sustenance for their bodies, they would faint along the way.
[time=2685] The sorry state of their physical condition touched his heart and he had tenderness.
[time=2691] And he met their need.
[time=2694] Again later in his ministry, the same thing happened again.
[time=2697] He saw their condition and was moved with compassion.
[time=2703] He was going out from Jericho and a great multitude again was following him.
[time=2707] Behold two blind men sitting by the road hearing that Jesus was passing by, crying out, Lord, have mercy on us, son of David.
[time=2715] And the multitude sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more saying, Lord, have mercy on us, son of David.
[time=2721] And Jesus stopped and called to them and said, what do you want for me to do?
[time=2727] And they said to him, Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.
[time=2731] Lord, we want our eyes to be opened.
[time=2734] The text says, and moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes and immediately they regained their sight and followed him.
[time=2741] Somehow this wonderful God in human flesh was able to realize and empathize and sympathize what it would be like not to have any eyesight.
[time=2752] Not to be able to see the sun rise and to see the sun set.
[time=2756] Not to be able to view the food you're reading.
[time=2758] Not to be able to see your mother and father.
[time=2760] Not to be able to see where you were going so you always had to be led by someone else.
[time=2764] To be blind.
[time=2766] Just even that physical condition touched his heart, it softened it, and he was moved with compassion, and he healed them.
[time=2776] What's the principle I'm trying to drive towards here?
[time=2779] When you are in conflict, you need to develop the ability to see behind that other person's anger,
[time=2788] behind that other person's vengeful activity towards you and see the hurt and the pain and the sorry condition of their soul,
[time=2796] and let that part of them touch your heart to the point that you become tender towards them.
[time=2805] You see, we forget who we're dealing with.
[time=2807] Instead of viewing our spouses as a cherished child of God, somebody's son, somebody's little daughter,
[time=2815] we begin to view them as the enemy because they cause us pain and mess our life up.
[time=2820] One of the things we like to do in the Morehouse Hold is wrestle, and the girls are always asking me to go back on the master bedroom there and fight a little bit and wrestle.
[time=2828] We play king of the bed, you see, so we fight our way out of the bed and then we try to throw each other off the bed.
[time=2834] As we go up, I like to play a little rougher with them because I don't want them to be pansies, you see.
[time=2839] I kind of like the tomboy side.
[time=2841] And so, you know, occasionally we'll get a bloody nose or we'll get a little tear here or there, and I might have thrown them a little too abruptly off the edge of the bed.
[time=2849] They come back and fight some more, and I'll take one of the nose.
[time=2853] You know, these kinds of things go on. We just love it. It's just a great time.
[time=2857] This last week, the older girls were doing something else and Whitney, "Daddy!" Whitney's four years old, "Daddy, let's go rough horse on the bed!" And so we hustle back there and I'm kind of getting into it and I kind of forget what I'm doing here.
[time=2870] I'm going to play a little too rough and come boomp with the pillow a little too hard, and then we're wrestling and rolling over. I think I got her in the headlock.
[time=2876] And suddenly, I hear this, "Daddy, Daddy, it's me, Whitney!" (Laughter) "Hey, it's not Randy you got!" (Laughter) "And it's not Nikki, and it's not Kelly, it's your four year old, okay?" "Let's take it down a few notches, Pop." (Laughter) "Oh baby, isn't that cute?" "Dad, Dad, it's me, Whitney!" "Remember, you know, we've got to be able to listen behind the anger and behind the frustration
[time=2910] and behind the aloofness, behind whatever it is your spouse does when they get angry and hurt and want to run away or come after you with all. And here's a little voice back there saying, "You know what, it's me. I'm somebody's son. I'm somebody's little boy.
[time=2924] I used to be somebody's little girl.
[time=2927] Could you find any tenderness in your heart for me as a human being who's hurting and struggling in this situation?
[time=2935] And could your compassion and could your tenderness be so big as to overlook what I've done sinfully against you?
[time=2943] And could we connect at the point of your tenderness and could it be a bridge that takes us back across the chasm of our separation
[time=2954] and brings us back into intimacy?" My friend's the answer to that question is yes.
[time=2960] It will not fail you.
[time=2962] If you will be willing to have compassion and tenderness for the condition they are in and if you'll pursue them on that level, you will find yourselves like huge magnets crashing together.
[time=2976] I would also add that until you have made some level of connection with their condition, the pain and the hurt and the disappointment, you're probably not ready to work towards any solution in your marriage.
[time=2988] Until you have moved in that direction, it reveals you are probably still in a defensive posture in your own heart.
[time=2996] Until you are connecting with them and a tenderness is moving towards them from your heart, it probably reveals you haven't done the A yet and you are still in a defensive self-protective mode.
[time=3008] And very little, if any good, will come out of the conflict resolution.
[time=3015] So on the one hand, we're ruthless with ourselves.
[time=3020] We refuse to explain away our sin based upon our own hardships and our own pain and our own sorrow.
[time=3026] We just come in the presence of God and beg Him to convict us of our sin and wipe away our excuses so we can go to our spouse and without explanation and without seeking understanding, just say what I have done is a violation of who you have been made in the image of God.
[time=3040] Please forgive me and mean it from the core of our being.
[time=3044] But on the other hand, when it comes to how we treat our spouse, we want to engage them at the level of their hurt and their disappointment.
[time=3052] We want to understand more about it.
[time=3056] For in so doing, we believe it will even enable us to be more forgiving than before.
[time=3065] Well, here comes the sea of conflict resolution, ABC.
[time=3070] Communicate.
[time=3072] Communicate with compassion.
[time=3077] When you finally do begin to communicate, strive in your communication to get a clear admission of your own sin on the table
[time=3086] in a convincing fashion.
[time=3089] Work hard to convince that person that you are aware of your sin and the damage you have done and you are grieved for it.
[time=3098] Secondly, work hard at drawing them out.
[time=3103] Work hard at soliciting further information about what they're really feeling and how they're really hurting and what you've done and how it's impacted them negatively.
[time=3112] Spend some time, long time listening earnestly to hear the passion of their heart.
[time=3121] Draw it out from them.
[time=3123] Let it impact you.
[time=3124] Empathize with it. Put yourself in their shoes.
[time=3127] Listen long and hard to what they have to say to you.
[time=3130] Invite that information in your life.
[time=3135] We need to do that. We desperately need to do that.
[time=3139] Think of the difference that would happen in your life.
[time=3142] If driving down a lonely farm road in Indiana at some time in the darkness and you just barely saw a flash kind of come across your car and you heard a thud but you wanted to get where you were going so you just kind of kept on moving assuming maybe it was a farm animal or a deer or something.
[time=3158] That whole episode would have very little impact on your life.
[time=3162] But you stop your car, pull around and put the headlights on to what you just hit and find out that it's somebody's six-year-old little boy.
[time=3170] And he's now brain hemorrhaging right there on the road and you pick him up and try to get him to a hospital. I think you're going to be changed forever.
[time=3179] My friends, we can't bounce off of our spouses and not take time to listen carefully
[time=3185] to the damage that we have done to their souls.
[time=3189] Because if we'll just hear it and see it and let it impact us, we'll be a lot less likely to do it next time.
[time=3198] Listen long and listen hard.
[time=3202] Well, here's a quick one. An extra. ABCD. No extra charge.
[time=3208] D is this. Don't be afraid to ask for help.
[time=3212] Don't be afraid to ask for help. Good night.
[time=3214] Don't be afraid to ask for help. Find some close friends.
[time=3217] When you're in a conflict and you're trying to resolve it the best you know how and you can't get your way out of it, find somebody to help you.
[time=3224] Share your concern with another couple you can trust or find a marriage counselor who would be willing to sit down with you so that that conflict does not go into
[time=3234] the junk pile of your relationship and continue to be the stuff out of which future relational walls are being built.
[time=3242] Instead, it can be a glorious moment of conflict resolution where you can say today in a way maybe you'd never said before we are growing together and I have proof because of the way we just resolve that conflict.
[time=3258] Well, as we wrap this series up, let me ask you to do a couple things.
[time=3263] Number one, I want to ask you to understand that if you're here today and if you've been a part of these messages and you have not received Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, that the information I'm sharing is not enough to change your relationship with your spouse.
[time=3281] The Bible tells us that we are born sinfully with a spirit of rebellion.
[time=3287] We come into the world with a spirit of rebellion and as long as that spirit of rebellion
[time=3293] is not dealt with through a personal encounter with the person of Jesus Christ, all the advice in the world about marriage conflict resolution and pursuing intimacy will be of no avail to you because you are intrinsically wired for conflict.
[time=3309] But if you'll come to Christ and be reconciled first in your relationship with God,
[time=3316] you will find he will transform your heart and suddenly you will long to be reconciled in your relationships with people and you'll be willing to pay a huge price, a personal price to make sure that relationship is as it ought to be.
[time=3330] But apart from the power of Christ, there are no resources and there is no hope for true intimacy and conflict resolution.
[time=3339] The second thing I want to say is those to you who are believers.
[time=3344] My greatest fear in this series is that you would assume now having heard some things about marriage, adding maybe a few things that you'd heard before that you've got everything you need now to resolve your marriage conflict and move towards intimacy.
[time=3357] Nothing could be further from the truth.
[time=3360] I want to invite you to master your marriage.
[time=3363] I want to invite you to go after it with a vengeance.
[time=3366] I want to invite you not to let another day go by, that you are not thinking and purposing and learning and reading and going to conferences and buying tapes and doing whatever you have to do, submitting yourself to other friends, scrutiny, finding marriage counselors, whatever it takes to move your marriage in a way that pleases God.
[time=3386] I want to invite you and plead with you to do that.
[time=3388] I promise you, there is nothing more exciting in all of life.
[time=3414] If as you look into your heart, you recognize that you have the spirit of rebellion and that that is affecting your relationships, whether with a spouse, people at work.
[time=3422] There's only one solution to that.
[time=3424] And that's to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3427] If you'd like to do that even now, let me invite you to bow your head and pray with me the simple prayer and give your life to Christ.
[time=3435] Father, I know that I am a sinner and that I have the spirit of rebellion in my heart and I need instead the spirit of reconciliation.
[time=3443] Forgive me, Father, for my sins.
[time=3445] I commit my life to you and accept Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3449] Thank you for providing the way of salvation even for me.
[time=3453] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3455] If you prayed that simple little prayer of accepting Christ as your Savior, we'd love to hear from you and send you some information that will help you get started in your Christian walk.
[time=3464] God bless you.
