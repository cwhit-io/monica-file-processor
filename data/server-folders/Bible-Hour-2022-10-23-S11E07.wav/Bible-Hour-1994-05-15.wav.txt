[time=0] God, in fact, is in the business of changing people.
[time=5] That's what He does for a living.
[time=7] You've heard the phrase "writer, rinse, trucks." Well, God changes people.
[time=26] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=34] Thank you for joining us.
[time=36] They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
[time=40] And in most cases, that is true.
[time=42] Once people get set in their ways, it becomes increasingly difficult for them to make significant or lasting changes.
[time=49] And that can be rather discouraging, especially if there are some areas in your life that you really would like to change.
[time=55] Well, the good news is that God is in the business of changing people.
[time=59] In fact, He specializes in it.
[time=61] With God's help, real change is possible.
[time=65] And today, Pastor Moore explains that God uses change agents as He seeks to renew our hope in God's great plan for our lives.
[time=74] Our special music today will be presented by Stephen Ria Gardner.
[time=83] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=113] Sing unto the Lord on His song.
[time=117] Let His praise us fill it at home.
[time=123] He is King of Kings and the Lord of Hosts.
[time=128] Bow down before Him.
[time=133] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=154] Sing unto the Lord on His song, for He loves to hear our praises.
[time=164] Let our love creation see, glory to our God.
[time=170] Bow down before Him.
[time=175] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=216] Sing unto the Lord on His song.
[time=227] Let His praise us fill it at home.
[time=233] He is King of Kings and the Lord of Hosts.
[time=238] Bow down before Him.
[time=243] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=297] Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
[time=314] Thank you for watching the Bible Hour today.
[time=316] We were really encouraged this week as we received some letters from you, indicating that you're watching.
[time=322] Some of you accepted Christ as your Savior.
[time=324] Others of you are reading your Bible.
[time=326] That's really an encouragement.
[time=327] That's what it's all about.
[time=329] I have some special guests in the studio.
[time=331] Today I want to introduce them to you, Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=333] Steve and Maria, it's nice to have you here.
[time=335] Hi.
[time=336] Good to be here.
[time=337] Now you've been in Fort Wayne before, but for a number of years, Steve, you've been away from Fort Wayne.
[time=341] Tell us where you've been.
[time=342] We moved away to California.
[time=344] Don't ask me why.
[time=345] It's a long story.
[time=346] But we have always missed this part of the country.
[time=349] And so after a few years in California and a few years in Colorado, we've finally made our way back home.
[time=355] Now usually when we talk about Steve and Maria, we talk about one other person who isn't with us today, but what a pretty important part of the family.
[time=361] Who's that?
[time=362] Yeah, that's our daughter, Mandy.
[time=363] Mandy is 18 and is just finishing her freshman year at Taylor University.
[time=368] That's great.
[time=369] So she's grown up on us.
[time=371] Yeah, so I remember the time when we sang in a concert about 1977, when Mandy was barely walking.
[time=377] Yeah, that's right.
[time=378] A lot of time has gone by.
[time=379] Yes, yes.
[time=380] Well, you've just completed a new album called The Eye of the Storm, and we're going to premiere it soon.
[time=385] So that's the reason why you're here.
[time=387] Tell us a little bit about the album, Steve.
[time=389] Well, we're really excited about this.
[time=391] In many ways, I think it's the best we've ever done.
[time=395] But a couple of the songs people might be interested in.
[time=398] One of them in fact features Mandy.
[time=400] It's called She Was Only 15.
[time=402] And it's about an episode where Mandy was counseling with one of her friends, 15-year-old girl, who had become sexually involved.
[time=412] There's so many of the kids are these days.
[time=415] And it's a call to abstinence.
[time=418] But for those who have already crossed that line, the song deals with how you can be forgiven and cleansed and recapture in a sense that innocence before God.
[time=429] And so that's one of the songs.
[time=431] And we're excited that Mandy will be able to be with us at the premiere performance and be able to sing it.
[time=436] The song as far as the arrangement and just the style too.
[time=439] How do you decide on that?
[time=441] Steve writes all the lyrics to our music.
[time=444] But David Stroop wrote some of the music and arranged it.
[time=449] And basically we would just sit down and talk about styles.
[time=452] And then David would tell us what he was thinking.
[time=456] It's a back and forth kind of thing that takes sometimes a lot of times together to get it like we wanted.
[time=462] And we for sure have to be, it has to be who we are in a way.
[time=466] And since we're so many different things, we have a lot of variety.
[time=470] We like a lot of variety.
[time=472] One of the songs that people have really been responding to, because we've been singing a little bit of this music now for a little while, is a song that is about our marriage experience.
[time=484] We've just celebrated our 26th anniversary.
[time=486] And so we've been through some really great times and some very difficult times.
[time=490] And there's a song where we're really open about kind of the highlights and low lights of that time.
[time=498] It's called "Remember the Days." We're going to continue this discussion and even run it on to two inserts.
[time=505] But I want to remind all of you that are watching.
[time=508] To set this data side, that's June 19th.
[time=511] That's a Sunday evening at 6 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=515] We're going to have the special premiere concert with Stephen Maria Gardner and Mandy joining them that evening.
[time=522] That'll be all brand new music.
[time=524] There's going to be a little bit of humor, there's going to be a little reminiscing.
[time=527] And they'll have the opportunity then to introduce you to all of these great songs.
[time=531] And it'll be an opportunity too then for you to take a CD or a cassette, take it home and enjoy this ministry of music that's exciting, but will really challenge your heart too.
[time=542] So the date is June 19th.
[time=545] Let's listen to Jeff Carlson now as he tells us about this month's gift offer.
[time=550] Thank you for joining us this morning.
[time=553] We'll return to the service in just a moment.
[time=555] But first I want to tell you about a very special gift we're offering for the first time here on the Bible Hour for All Our Fathers.
[time=563] It's a beautiful hardbound book titled "A Father's Gift, The Legacy of Memories." This heartwarming book written by Ken Geier is our way of saying thanks to all our fathers for the love, hard work and dedication they give to their families every day.
[time=579] A father's gift takes a nostalgic stroll back through the author's childhood as he reflects on the many memories of growing up with his father.
[time=588] A father's gift is written in lyrical prose and will touch the heart of any reader who remembers just how really important fathers are.
[time=596] No doubt pictures of your own father will come to mind as you leave through the pages, each one painting a different picture and reminding you at the same time of the unseen guiding hand of our Heavenly Father.
[time=608] The Bible Hour is offering this beautiful Father's Day gift free to all who write and request it.
[time=614] To receive a Father's Gift, The Legacy of Memories, please write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=624] That's the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=629] Write to us this week, won't you?
[time=632] Now, let's return to our service.
[time=643] I know a place where there is safety, comfort and love
[time=655] where I can be a simple child, not fearing judgment from above.
[time=669] I know a place in God's great arms I can be me
[time=680] and here on earth is arms of love.
[time=687] I know a place where I can be a simple child, not a place where I can be a simple child.
[time=710] No tender voice like I can be so warm.
[time=723] I need thee, oh I need thee, every o'er I need thee.
[time=736] O bless me now my Savior, I come to you.
[time=752] I know a place where there is safety, comfort and comfort.
[time=763] Where I can be a simple child, not fearing judgment from above.
[time=775] I need thee, oh I need thee, in God's great arms I can be me
[time=789] and here on earth is arms of love.
[time=796] Are the church my home and family.
[time=805] One of the greatest gifts that God has given us is the church, the body of believers, each other.
[time=811] As we support each other through our fellowship, through intercession, through encouragement,
[time=818] there is something that works like nothing else on this planet.
[time=823] It's God's gift to us.
[time=826] And here on earth is arms of love.
[time=834] Are the church my home and family.
[time=853] Thank you.
[time=861] Well as we begin our message this morning, let me ask you what you would answer true or false to this statement.
[time=869] You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
[time=874] Would you basically, from your experience and life, observing other people, would you respond true to that or false to that?
[time=882] You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
[time=885] My guess is most of us would respond yes, in fact that's why it's an old cliche.
[time=890] It's basically true.
[time=892] I remember my grandfather, by the time I was old enough to know what was going on, he was in his late 60s, early 70s and every single morning.
[time=900] He got up and had two pieces of wheat toasted with the same peanut butter and a hot cup of coffee and he read the same two newspapers.
[time=910] And you could come out with all the pop tarts and granola cereals in the world and all the new kind of news television shows early in the morning.
[time=918] It didn't phase him one Iota.
[time=920] He had his system and he was going to stay with his system.
[time=923] Experts even tell us in child psychology, but by the time you're about five years old, most of what you are is already determined.
[time=931] And the rest of life is merely living that out.
[time=935] What's already been decided inside you in those first five years.
[time=939] And so it is a truism and there is a lot of truth to it and as we observe the people in our workplace and the people in our families and the people that we know, it's basically true to say that you can't teach an old dog new tricks.
[time=950] When you bring that truism into your Christianity, however, you are in trouble.
[time=957] Especially when we've finished a series like we just have about marriage and there have been many things said in that marriage which I trust were thought provoking and some of which might have been convicting.
[time=966] Others might have been very appealing, changes that you might like to make, emphasis that you might like to give.
[time=971] But sometimes you know yourself well enough and you've fallen into the cliche.
[time=976] You can't teach an old dog new tricks that you kind of back away even from the effort to change.
[time=981] And you kind of just resign yourself and say you know what I've kind of always been this way.
[time=986] We've kind of always related this way and we're probably always going to relate this way.
[time=991] And whether it relates to how you treat a spouse or for the singles in our midst who I think also were challenged just to think about relationships,
[time=998] you can just kind of fall back into a quiet fatalism that says you know it doesn't really matter what I do and what I don't do.
[time=1004] And I don't even think it much matters what God does. I am what I am and that's the way I'm going to stay.
[time=1008] And so I may as well just kind of live on the way I've been living.
[time=1012] I want you to know that the Christian faith is grounded upon the claim that people can change no matter how old they are.
[time=1020] The Bible clearly teaches us that people can experience radical life transformation if they will give God a chance to work in their life.
[time=1031] He can take the insensitive unkind person and change them into a sensitive kind person.
[time=1037] The undisciplined, uncontrolled into one who has self mastery.
[time=1041] The proud, stiff-necked into the humble, simple heart of submission. The stingy, self-indulgent miser into the generous contributor to other people's needs.
[time=1052] The moody, gloomy person into the content and joyful person.
[time=1057] The indifferent, uncaring person into the thoughtful and compassionate.
[time=1062] By the power of God, God is in the business of changing people.
[time=1066] You've heard the slogan, "Rider, rinse trucks." That's because that's what they do. God changes people.
[time=1074] He's in the people changing business.
[time=1077] But for many of us, we have reached a point where we have lost hope and we have given up on the idea that God can actually change us.
[time=1086] Many of you here today who are believers have reached that point.
[time=1091] I don't know how it works for everybody, but for many people you'll find yourself in a process where you come to Christ and there is great hope and great expectation of change.
[time=1101] You can see yourself for the first time in your life as a sinner in need of a Savior.
[time=1106] And with that sense of new, fresh forgiveness, you begin to expect marvelous changes that are going to impact every dimension of your life.
[time=1115] And some of those are actually forthcoming, at least early on in the deal.
[time=1120] But then you notice that two years, three years, four years, five years into the game, you're still struggling with some of the same besetting sins.
[time=1129] Some of them you can even slump into with greater severity than you'd known before.
[time=1136] And you haven't changed, and as much as you wanted to, and you've had a little success, but the struggle is enormous, and because we don't become totally changed instantly after salvation.
[time=1147] And as we go on to see how slow the process really is, we can begin to give up on change altogether and just settle for what we are.
[time=1159] I want to remind you that when God talks about the change process in the life of the believer, he uses words like growth, which implies a process.
[time=1168] He uses words like being transformed, Romans 12 being transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=1174] Nothing about that word indicates that anything is going to happen really fast, that the transformation process is going to begin and be over in a heartbeat.
[time=1183] In fact, it's our entire life that this transformation process goes on.
[time=1187] There's nothing to indicate we should expect miraculous instant change overnight.
[time=1192] He uses the word to be sanctified, which is the process of moving away from the things of the world into the conformity of Christ.
[time=1200] But even that word is a process word.
[time=1205] It's a process, it's a step at a time, it's a day in, day out, or deal.
[time=1210] And so it's not right to just give up, because it hasn't happened totally to you.
[time=1217] In fact, I think it's important that we note that it is a process and it takes time because that is exactly the way God designed it.
[time=1227] Do you understand that?
[time=1228] God did not have to set our sanctification up as a slow, arduous process.
[time=1233] He is in control, he is all-powerful, he could have set the ground rules up completely different.
[time=1239] He could have set it this way, work hard in a particular area of weakness in your life, master that area in a period of six to twelve months,
[time=1248] and then you can shut the book on that problem, you'll never deal with it again, it'll be gone, it'll be over.
[time=1254] Nothing prevented him from doing it that way, now he hasn't, and you and I know we're going to struggle with the same weaknesses and the same sins until they finally bury us.
[time=1264] But it's not that way by accident, it's not that way because, oh, gee, why didn't I think of that God says to himself?
[time=1271] Boy, that would have been a better way to run the world.
[time=1273] Why didn't I just have people get fixed instantly at salvation?
[time=1277] It is the way it is by God's design.
[time=1280] There are purposes and reasons in the process that allow us to continue to have to struggle with what we are and who we are and who we aren't all the way through our life.
[time=1290] So it's not a mistake, he wants us in the struggle, he wants us in the battle, he wants us in the fight, he wants us to be believing that he can grow us, he just wants us to trust him in his timing and in his way.
[time=1305] What happens with us is when he doesn't grow us as fast as we think he ought to, when we don't see the results that we think we're entitled to, we become bitter against the process,
[time=1317] and we distance ourselves from a heartfelt commitment to growth and change and transformation, and we just settle in and say this must just be the way it is.
[time=1332] So in the time that remains this morning I'd like to spend it working and reminding you and me of the five change agents that God has given us.
[time=1343] There are five very powerful change agents that God has designed for us to use in the here and now, before now in the grave, whereby we can experience real, tangible, significant growth.
[time=1357] Is it all at once? No. Is it easy? No. Is it real? Yes. Is it worth pursuing? You bet.
[time=1366] Can we justify our complacency? No.
[time=1369] Well, tell me then, what are they? The first one, number one, remember to feed upon his word. Remember to feed upon his word.
[time=1380] When you look at this Bible, when you look at your Bible, do you view it the way you used to when you first got saved?
[time=1389] Do you look at this book and say, do you realize that in here there are nuggets of truth that can absolutely transform my life?
[time=1399] And so you come now like you used to come with the expectation of not just learning what a particular book of the Bible is about, but being actually changed by your time in God's Word?
[time=1413] Do you still hold this up in your heart as the source of unlimited spiritual power to impact your life for the cause of Christ, or has it become the thing that you bring with you to church?
[time=1425] The thing that you spend a few moments in, maybe every day, and it's a part of your routine. It's a part of what you do.
[time=1434] It's definitely something you believe in, but the fundamental thing I'm looking for is are you coming to it with the earnest expectation and belief that it can change your life?
[time=1447] Or have you lost that?
[time=1450] Have you come to it so many times in the past and not walked away with a quote unquote spiritual buzz or a fuzzy feeling?
[time=1457] And suddenly, as you noticed your life progressing, things didn't change as much as you want, and so you begin to draw the conclusion quietly and subtly one you wouldn't want to share with your friends, but still you believe it in your heart.
[time=1470] You know what, this thing just doesn't cut it.
[time=1475] Now I'll hang on to it and I'll continue to look at it from time to time, and from time to time I remember some old verses that used to be meaningful.
[time=1482] Yeah, but change my life?
[time=1486] I don't think you can teach an old dog a new trick.
[time=1491] Let me give you four ways to re-approach coming to the Word, just four little little phrases. You might jot these down, even somewhere in your Bible, and then look back to them.
[time=1499] I think you can count on these. Go back to the place, or go to the Word of God to recapture.
[time=1508] Now here's the phrase, a dependent attitude, or you can reverse it, an attitude of dependence.
[time=1513] Go to the Word seeking and believing that the Word can refresh in you an attitude of dependence.
[time=1520] What I mean by dependence? He's in charge, I'm not. He's in control, I'm not.
[time=1524] I live because he exists, I live for his existence. He's in charge, I submit.
[time=1530] Be willing to go back to the Word of God seeking and striving and believing that it can rekindle in you an attitude of dependence upon God.
[time=1540] To where you can say with Paul, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness." You can reach that rock bottom place of dependence upon God.
[time=1550] Secondly, go to the Word of God so it can put truth back in your mind.
[time=1556] It can put truth back in your mind. I've noticed as I look at my own life and other Christians' lives, that as we live through the everyday course of our life, we begin to believe things that are not true.
[time=1568] We begin to practically believe things we know theoretically are not true.
[time=1573] For example, we begin to believe that God really isn't as good as He said He is, or He wouldn't have allowed this to happen to me.
[time=1582] God is somehow less than really good. God is somehow less than caring, somehow less than involved.
[time=1588] Maybe His plan for my life really isn't as good as I thought it was.
[time=1593] Those are lies that subtly and quietly creep into the soil of our minds, and unless we're back in the Word of God reaffirming the truth of the truth,
[time=1602] who God is, that sin still is sin, that I need to repent, that I need to obey, that there's a value in obedience,
[time=1608] that there are real, tangible rewards in living this life the way God wants me to.
[time=1613] You can be influenced by the power of the world and begin to believe things that are not true.
[time=1619] So go back to the Word of God to fill your mind again with truth.
[time=1624] Number three, to put love back in the motive department of your life.
[time=1630] To put love back in your motives. Go back to the Word of God and seek the attitude of denying yourself and taking up your cross.
[time=1638] Find it in the life of Christ, find it in the life of Paul, find it in the life of Peter, find it and search it and seek it and ask for God to bring it back through your study of the Word.
[time=1649] To where you're realigning the motive in your life to be that of serving other people.
[time=1655] And lastly, go back to the place of faith in your heart.
[time=1658] Go to the Word of God to put faith in your heart.
[time=1661] To where again you can believe and have an assurance of things hoped for and a conviction of things not seen.
[time=1666] You know that wears thin if you're not in the Word.
[time=1669] Your ability to really have an assurance of hope, things hoped for and a conviction of things that are not seen.
[time=1675] Your ability to do that begins to wane and weaken if you are not back in the Word to restranthen that dimension in your life.
[time=1683] So remember the Word of God.
[time=1688] It can put dependence in your attitude, truth in your mind, love in your motives and faith in your heart and seek it for that purpose.
[time=1695] That's why the Psalmist says the Word of God is more desirable than gold.
[time=1700] And it's sweeter than honey.
[time=1704] That's why 1 Peter 2 says along for it.
[time=1708] Like a pure milk of the Word, like a newborn babe longs for his mother's milk.
[time=1716] You say, "I don't think God changes people.
[time=1719] I don't think God teaches me new tricks.
[time=1721] I'm pretty much the same person I've always been.
[time=1723] I pretty much think I'm going to die." You see, some people call that wisdom.
[time=1727] I call that foolishness because this book is all about changing us significantly, painfully and over time, but still significantly.
[time=1742] But if you come to it without that expectation, you sell yourself short.
[time=1747] Change agent number 2, don't forget the power of prayer.
[time=1753] Oh, you can almost feel the cynicism, can't you?
[time=1756] It's like, ah, if one more person talks to me about the power of prayer, I'm going to throw up because I am so disillusioned with my prayer life.
[time=1766] I am so disillusioned with what God does not do in response to my prayers and the insignificant impact that it has upon the course of affairs in my life.
[time=1776] I don't even want to hear about prayer anymore.
[time=1779] Do I pray? Oh, sure, I pray.
[time=1781] I pray at mealtime and I throw a prayer or two up before I go to bed and maybe when I wake up in the morning.
[time=1786] But I don't want to hear you stand up there and tell me that God can do things through prayer.
[time=1791] I don't want to hear that prayer is the nerve that moves the arm of God because I've done my share of praying and his hand hasn't moved.
[time=1800] See, it's such a fundamental truth, but we've turned on that truth to the degree that we don't even want to hear it anymore.
[time=1811] The cynicism just is overwhelming.
[time=1815] Come to the book of Hebrews for a minute, chapter 4, let me just refresh your memory and mine as well.
[time=1821] Hebrews, chapter 4.
[time=1831] It says there in Hebrews 4, verse 12, kind of this first verse as a reiteration of the first point talks about the power of God's Word.
[time=1839] For the Word of God is living an active and sharper than any two-edged sword and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit of both joints and marrow
[time=1848] and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. There it is.
[time=1852] That's point one all over again. You're dealing with a living, active Word of God.
[time=1859] Because it is that, look at verse 13.
[time=1862] There is no creature hidden from his sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
[time=1869] In other words, God's Word so completely penetrates through the soul, the spirit, the intentions, the thoughts of the heart that you can't hide,
[time=1877] you can't mask. And that really isn't a very comforting thought.
[time=1882] Verse 14, "Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, just Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
[time=1890] For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weakness but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin."
[time=1897] The remarkable thing is God says, "My Word can look into your life and cut through all the facades and all the fake reasonings
[time=1905] and all the stupid rationales and drive down to the core of your true reasoning. I can lay you open and bare.
[time=1913] But I don't do that so I can judge you. I do that so I can sympathize with you at the heartbeat of your life.
[time=1922] Through the experience of my son who came and lived and died and experienced all the temptations of life, I lay you bare so I can sympathize with you where you really hurt."
[time=1934] So then look at the next verse. What's it say then? Because that's true, because he knows everything and because he sympathizes with you, what does it say?
[time=1943] Verse 16, "Let us therefore draw near with confidence to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[time=1955] Come on in. Come find me. Seek me through prayer. Find your way into the throne room where you can beg for the help that you need in time of need because I already know your problems and I already sympathize with your problems.
[time=1970] And I have the resources in my mercy and my grace to change your life significantly so come and come with confidence and come believing that I will help you.
[time=1980] Remember, please, the power of prayer is not to get God to change your circumstances, but to give you the help and the mercy and grace to live inside those circumstances.
[time=1991] So I don't want to kill you with this, but remember the words of James that the Affirmative, Factual, Prayer of a Righteous Man avail of much?
[time=1998] Remember the words of Paul in almost every letter he ever wrote to people he cared about?
[time=2003] He said, "I am praying for you without ceasing." And sometimes he would tell us what he was praying and it was all about their growth and their change and their attitudes and their minds and their values and that God would strengthen them in the inner man and allow them to continue to live in a powerfully transformed way.
[time=2020] I believe that Paul was pretty convinced that there was a power in prayer that could actually do something.
[time=2030] We pray to the God who was able to do exceeding abundantly beyond all that we ask or think.
[time=2035] We pray to the very God who, knowing there would be times in our lives, Romans 8, when we wouldn't be able to articulate our own prayer requests because of grief and the groaning of life.
[time=2048] Who has commissioned his Holy Spirit to pray on our behalf.
[time=2052] When we drop the baton of prayer because of the, we want to pray and we're trying to pray, but we don't know how to pray, God commissions the Holy Spirit to pick the baton up and deliver it safely.
[time=2065] To interpret it in heavenly language that only the Spirit of God and God can understand.
[time=2071] Can God change you through prayer? Yeah.
[time=2074] Let me ask you a question. When was the last time you went to God believing in the power of prayer and believing in his power to change you with an earnest heart and crying out and saying, "God, I need your help.
[time=2086] I am an undisciplined person.
[time=2089] I am a sinfully undisciplined person, and I've been that way since I was a little toddler, and I think I got a lot of it from the way I was raised, but nevertheless I stand here today as an undisciplined person, and it's killing me and it's violating you and it's violating the people of my life.
[time=2108] God, please change me. Do you think he hears that prayer? Or do you think he turns a deaf ear against that prayer?" No, I think he hears it.
[time=2120] And if any of you have children, you know he hears it because when your child comes to you with simplicity of heart, explaining their failures and asking for help, there's hardly anything on God's green earth that'll keep you from delivering what you can to help them.
[time=2137] But how often do we pray like that?
[time=2142] Where does the cynical attitude come from? Where does the lack of faith come from that backs away from the power of prayer and says, "I've done that enough and it didn't happen big enough for me those times.
[time=2153] And so now I lay me down to sleep. Thanks God for a great day. Please help me tomorrow." And he wants you to run into the throne room with a full heart of faith and say, "God, please help me change."
[time=2172] Number three. Number three, remember the power of the Holy Spirit. When you come with me to Colossians chapter one, Colossians chapter one, that's an interesting book, the Book of Colossians, it's all about trying to grow.
[time=2188] But these people were trying to grow in all the wrong ways. We don't have time to develop that this morning, but there's a whole section in the Book of Colossians that says that man's wisdom, called philosophy, is not the right way to grow.
[time=2200] There's another section in the Book of Colossians that says legalism. You know where you heap upon yourself, all kinds of strict religious standards.
[time=2207] And boy, I'm going to grow because I'm going to keep all these standards and I'm going to grow because I don't do this and I don't do this and I don't do this and I do do this and I do do this, I'm going to grow through my legalism.
[time=2216] And the Book of Colossians says, "No, you can't grow that way." There's another section in the Book of Colossians that talks about asceticism, which is self-denial in a stupid, ridiculous way.
[time=2227] As if to say, I'll deny myself the basic, normal, average things of life and through my asceticism, through denial, then I'll grow.
[time=2235] The Bible says, "No, you don't grow through asceticism." So Colossians both says how you don't grow, but it gives the truth about how you're supposed to grow.
[time=2247] You can pick it up there in verse 26 of chapter 1.
[time=2252] Boy, I wish we had a little more time for this, but we'll jump right in the middle of his argument.
[time=2256] He's saying that that is the mystery which had been hidden from the past ages and generations, but now has been manifested to his saints.
[time=2265] He's talking about this big mystery that nobody knew before, but now we got it.
[time=2268] Verse 27, "To whom God will to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles."
[time=2275] What's the mystery? What is this crescendoing to? It is the end of verse 27, Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[time=2285] This is what sets us apart from every other religion in the world.
[time=2289] We are the only people who worship a God who then indwells us, who is so committed to our growth and our transformation and our ability to continue to stay soft and change over time
[time=2301] and not give up hope, that he actually comes into us in the form of the Spirit of God, where he can bring his power to us.
[time=2314] The ministries of the Holy Spirit are so many, I'll just list them for you even without reference, it would take too long.
[time=2319] The ministry of the Holy Spirit, he comforts us, he teaches us, he convicts us of sin, he guides us in our confusion.
[time=2326] As we've noted, he intercedes for us when we don't know how to pray, he fills us, which is different than in dwelling,
[time=2332] to be filled with the Spirit, to be controlled under the control of the Spirit.
[time=2336] He produces his fruit in us, Galatians 5, all the wonderful character qualities of love, joy, peace, patience, and on the list goes.
[time=2343] And one passage in the New Testament even says that he oversees the entire sanctification process.
[time=2350] That whole process of having come to Christ until you're finally glorified, life as we know it, he oversees it, it's his job.
[time=2358] He's a professional at what he does.
[time=2361] He is in you, transforming you. His power is available to you.
[time=2368] Let me say it to you this way, whatever it is, whatever set of circumstances, whatever line of reasoning,
[time=2376] whatever it is that has led you to the conclusion, quietly and in your own heart,
[time=2382] that the Spirit of God simply can't change you is a lie.
[time=2390] However you've worked your way to the position that you have said, I just don't think I can grow,
[time=2396] I just don't think God can teach me new tricks, I just don't think I can really significantly change the way I relate with people.
[time=2403] Whatever it is that has brought you to that conclusion is a lie straight out of hell.
[time=2408] God is in the people changing business and to make sure it happens he puts the Holy Spirit inside your body
[time=2417] so that he can prompt and lead and comfort and teach and convict and in fact super intend the entire sanctification process.
[time=2430] He does all of that for the glory of God, he wants you to grow because he wants to glorify God, he does all of that because he wants to make you a powerful witness for the cause of Christ.
[time=2439] He does all of that so that we can minister one to another inside the body and build each other up and he does it because he loves you.
[time=2448] He does it because he happens to be in a very intimate love relationship with you and he wants you to grow
[time=2455] and he wants to see you change, he wants to see it be different.
[time=2460] Number four, remember the power of transforming relationships.
[time=2471] Remember the power and I should say of life transforming relationships.
[time=2477] You talk about change, there was this one individual who not only wanted to change, actually had no need to change himself,
[time=2484] he just came to change the whole world, namely the person of Jesus Christ and he did it.
[time=2489] I mean he is the master of change.
[time=2493] Listen to what it says about him, I just want to read this to you just to refocus on how incredibly Christ has impacted the world
[time=2500] and changed the world before we draw a conclusion from it, it's called the incomparable Christ.
[time=2505] More than 1900 years ago a man was born contrary to the laws of life.
[time=2509] This man lived in poverty and was raised in obscurity.
[time=2513] He did not travel extensively, only once did he cross the boundary of the country in which he lived and that was during his exile in childhood.
[time=2521] He possessed neither wealth nor influence, his relatives were inconspicuous and had neither training nor formal education.
[time=2527] In infancy he startled the king, in childhood he puzzled doctors and in manhood he ruled the course of nature,
[time=2534] walked upon the billows as if pavements and hushed the sea to sleep.
[time=2538] He healed the multitudes without medicine and made no charge for his service.
[time=2542] He never wrote a book and yet all the libraries in the country could not hold the books that had been written about him.
[time=2547] He never wrote a song and yet he has furnished the theme for more songs than all the songwriters combined.
[time=2553] He never founded a college but all the schools together could not boast of having as many students.
[time=2559] He never marshaled an army or drafted a soldier nor fired a gun yet no leader ever had more volunteers who have under his orders made more rebels stack arms and surrender without a shot fired.
[time=2570] He never practiced psychiatry and yet he has healed more Birken hearts than all the doctors far and near.
[time=2577] Once each week the wheels of commerce cease their turning and multitudes go their way to worshiping assemblies to pay homage and respect to him.
[time=2585] The names of the past statesman of Greece and Rome have come and gone, the names of past scientists, philosophers and theologians have come and gone,
[time=2592] but the name of this man abounds more and more.
[time=2596] The time is spread 1900 years between the people of this generation and the scene of his crucifixion yet he still lives.
[time=2604] Herod could not destroy him and the grave could not hold him.
[time=2608] He stands forth upon the highest pinnacle of heavenly glory, proclaimed by God, acknowledged by angels,
[time=2614] adored by saints, feared by devils as the living personal Christ, our Savior, Jesus Christ.
[time=2622] It's awesome. Change the world. Absolutely change the world more than any other person has ever changed it or will ever come close to change it.
[time=2631] You say how did he change it?
[time=2635] Answer. One person at a time.
[time=2639] One simple person at a time and as this writing describes it wasn't through founding colleges, it wasn't through writing books,
[time=2646] it wasn't through writing songs, it wasn't through setting up an organization, he just simply took a hold of twelve men's life.
[time=2653] And in Mark 3 when he's calling the twelve, he says to them, "I am appointing you so that you can be critical with me."
[time=2665] And then he finishes the verse by saying so that you can then go preach the good news to all the world.
[time=2670] And the whole of Christ's philosophy by which he changed the world is bound up in that one little verse he said to some men, you come and you be with me.
[time=2679] So that as we are going down the highways and byways of life, you can say stupid things in my presence which reveal how wrongly you are thinking about life and about God and about people and about me.
[time=2689] And as you are with me, then I will correct you and teach you.
[time=2693] When you are with me, you'll see me heal and do miracles and feed the five thousand and you'll see my heart of compassion.
[time=2699] You'll watch my response to the Pharisees and the antagonism of religious leaders.
[time=2706] But I can't teach you that in a classroom. I can't teach you that talking at you. You must come and be with me because Christ knows that you change people by being an immediate proximity to their life.
[time=2722] And so how did he change the world? One person at a time because Jesus knew the best way to transform the world was one person at a time and Jesus knew that the best way to transform people was in the context of personal relationship.
[time=2738] One of the strongest, most powerful agents of change that God has given us is in the form of being in life transforming relationship with each other.
[time=2749] That's why Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 1, you also became imitators of us and of the Lord.
[time=2757] There is the process of imitating the person in front of you.
[time=2761] He declares in that book that he was to them a tenderly loving mother and a strong leading father.
[time=2772] "Be imitators of me," he says to the Corinthians.
[time=2776] My only question for you this morning on this particular one is are you in a life transforming relationship?
[time=2782] Who is it in your life that you are looking at and looking to and being invested in by that can represent the power of God in your life to transform you?
[time=2794] And who is it that you have in your life that you have invited in your life so that you can transform them?
[time=2800] Maybe they're just a step behind you on the road of growth, but you want to do it like Christ did it.
[time=2807] You don't want to give up on the fundamental change agents which he has put in place for us.
[time=2812] Number five.
[time=2816] Remember, lastly, and this probably fitting is the last one, remember the power of perseverance in tribulation.
[time=2827] Remember the power of perseverance in tribulation.
[time=2831] Would you come to Romans 5 for just a brief closing moment here?
[time=2837] Remember the power of perseverance in tribulation.
[time=2842] It's because his spirit is in you.
[time=2844] It's because the Word of God is sharper and active than any two-edged sword.
[time=2847] It's because of the power of prayer.
[time=2849] It's because of the strong support and fellowship that we find in the body of the redeemed that this truth is also relevant.
[time=2859] Romans 5 verse 3 and not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations.
[time=2866] The word exalt is the biggest word in the New Testament for joy.
[time=2869] It's like to super joy.
[time=2871] It's bigger than the normal word joy.
[time=2873] We've got to just get excited about this.
[time=2875] We've got to grab ahold of this stuff.
[time=2876] We've got to let it penetrate us with joy as we look at this one thing, tribulation.
[time=2881] We've got to exalt in our tribulations knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance
[time=2887] and perseverance-proven character and proven character hope.
[time=2890] That's called growth, you guys.
[time=2892] You know, when you persevere under a tribulation, the mere perseverance is the stuff that God uses to knock off the sharp edges
[time=2902] and to cut away the draws and to draw out of you the character weaknesses that mere desire alone cannot take away.
[time=2913] He's got to heat it up.
[time=2915] He's got to put you through the refiner's fire.
[time=2919] Because even though you'd be willing to give up a character flaw, even though you'd be willing to give up a sin to a new degree, your willingness alone is not enough.
[time=2930] So he structures this world in a way that we can greet tribulation with joy if we'll stay in them long enough to let the proven character produce itself because that produces hope.
[time=2941] Look at verse 5, "And hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us." Hope.
[time=2950] Hope is the willingness to stay in the tribulation long enough to let God work His work.
[time=2957] Hope is the ability to live life in the hard lane of obedience because you believe with all your heart.
[time=2965] Hope that there's a day coming when all my sorrow and all my sadness is taken away.
[time=2970] Lack of hope on the other hand is this.
[time=2973] You do not believe that heaven is as good as it is to wait for.
[time=2978] So you live obediently now because you'll wait for it or if it's not good enough to wait for then you just live disobediently now and you escape from underneath the tribulation.
[time=2986] Remember the power of perseverance in tribulation?
[time=2991] Well the message is clear.
[time=2996] People can change.
[time=2998] Not everybody.
[time=3000] The people who have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ can change.
[time=3005] And you are those people.
[time=3009] God has not left you stuck to live out lives with no hope of growth, change or transformation.
[time=3015] But you have got to go back to the basics with a refurbished heart with an attitude that says,
[time=3025] "Yeah, I believe God can really change me." So remember the power of His word.
[time=3030] Remember the power of prayer.
[time=3031] Remember the power of the indwelling spirit.
[time=3033] Remember the power of transforming relationships and remember the power of perseverance in tribulation.
[time=3039] I remember this too.
[time=3041] Think back on some of the old dogs that God has changed.
[time=3044] There was an old pit bull running around Jerusalem named Saul.
[time=3049] I mean if I was going to put Saul in the dog category to my mind, the guy's a pit bull.
[time=3054] He's old, he's crusty, he's bitter, he's been in his share of fights and he doesn't back up.
[time=3059] He doesn't let go.
[time=3061] He was a legalist all the way to the core of who he was.
[time=3064] In fact when a group of people showed up saying that you could see God without keeping his legalistic rules he killed them.
[time=3072] But God took that old pit bull and transformed his life until he could become a gentle, tender, caring, loving mother
[time=3080] into the place where he would now die, which he eventually did for the grace of God as opposed to legalism.
[time=3086] I'd say that's called transformation.
[time=3088] I want you to remember his life was not without problem.
[time=3090] It was not without sin.
[time=3091] Read Romans 7.
[time=3092] It was not without difficult circumstances.
[time=3094] Read the book of 1 Corinthians and listen to his litany of problems.
[time=3099] But over time God was changing a nasty old pit bull into a gracious, compassionate, loving individual.
[time=3111] And then there's Peter who if I was going to put into the dog world I'd make him be goofy.
[time=3116] Walt Disney's goofy, undisciplined wild, out of control, out of touch, slightly dangerous.
[time=3126] The guy was just a loose cannon on deck.
[time=3130] But by the time he died he was this, he wrote 1 Peter and 2 Peter which is all about what?
[time=3135] Suffering.
[time=3136] He's the guy that said I deny you three times because he didn't want to take the heat and he didn't want to take the pressure
[time=3143] and he didn't want to take the consequences.
[time=3145] Before God's done with him he writes the two theologies on how to suffer for the cause of Christ and eventually was martyred for Christ.
[time=3153] God can teach all dogs new tricks.
[time=3157] And then there's what I consider the primped poodle of the New Testament with bows in his hair and white little teeth
[time=3166] and a special little French cut popping his way out of the beauty salon, Zacchaeus.
[time=3173] Zacchaeus was an absolute traitor and would do anything for his own comfort.
[time=3178] He turned on the Jewish people, fell into the hands of the Roman government and then from that position of power with his insight into the Jewish culture
[time=3186] he just traded, he then extorted finances from them under the name of being a tax gatherer.
[time=3192] He was fabulously wealthy.
[time=3195] He primped himself to the core.
[time=3199] He was totally materialistic until God transformed him.
[time=3206] And God took this pampered little poodle and he said at the point of his conversion, no less, I'm given half of my wealth to the poor.
[time=3216] And anybody I have extorted financially, I'm going to pay back fourfold.
[time=3222] Why fourfold?
[time=3223] He was an Old Testament Jew who knew the standard was twofold, but he was so overwhelmed by the transforming power of the grace of God.
[time=3232] Twofold wasn't enough, he wanted to go four.
[time=3236] I'd say somebody got changed.
[time=3239] And then there are the mutts, just the scroungy old mutts of the New Testament.
[time=3245] Those are the Christians of Corinth.
[time=3248] If you read 1 Corinthians 6 you'll see a pretty motley crew there.
[time=3252] A bunch of mutts running around the sewers of Corinth.
[time=3257] Many of them were just absolutely sexually addicted.
[time=3260] They were full and given and turned over to fornication and homosexuality and effeminate behavior and adultery.
[time=3266] It was a way of life.
[time=3268] The name of their city was synonymous with pornography.
[time=3273] And God changed them and made them morally virgins.
[time=3278] And they gave up their sinful wicked, sensuous practices.
[time=3282] And they stopped their adulteries and they stopped their fornications and they stopped their homosexuality.
[time=3289] And they moved over time into conformity to the purity and the virtue of Jesus Christ.
[time=3295] There were other mutts running around the city of Corinth.
[time=3298] They were caught up in false religious systems and idolatry and their minds were so screwed up about who God is and what life is and heaven and hell.
[time=3308] And they were just off the deep end in their false religious systems.
[time=3312] They were without hope completely over the edge.
[time=3314] Old dogs hardened and calcified in false religious systems until Christ got ahold of them.
[time=3321] And they repented and they recanted and they got rid of their idolatrous practices and they stopped believing the falsehood.
[time=3328] And they brought every thought captive to Christ and they served Him and Him alone.
[time=3334] There was another group of mutts running around Corinth and they were drunkards.
[time=3338] They were the people into escapism.
[time=3340] The way they dealt with life, the way they dealt with the hardship was they just ran away into the oblivion of alcohol and drugs.
[time=3349] They were old dogs. They burned bridges.
[time=3352] They were probably physically worn out from their alcoholism.
[time=3356] They had baggy eyes. They were just in bad shape until they met Christ.
[time=3364] And He transformed them, absolutely transformed them.
[time=3369] So where they could live productive lives without the escapism of drugs, they had meaning and purpose.
[time=3378] Well, the list there goes on. I want you to know that God is in the business of teaching old dogs new tricks and you have no business giving up on Him.
[time=3391] I don't care how slow your growth is.
[time=3395] I don't care how much you think He should have already done for you.
[time=3399] It doesn't matter because that's just your view.
[time=3404] The fact is God is so clearly in the people changing business and His agencies have changed our powerful and undeniable.
[time=3412] You've got to open your heart again and say, "God, change me."
[time=3420] Pastor Morris just concluded his message on change.
[time=3423] You know that you can be changed spiritually by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3428] I wonder today if you've accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.
[time=3432] You can do it by praying this prayer with me right now. Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3437] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you today and tell you that I'm a sinner.
[time=3442] I've sinned against you and I ask you to forgive me and be my Savior today.
[time=3447] In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.
[time=3451] If you prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
