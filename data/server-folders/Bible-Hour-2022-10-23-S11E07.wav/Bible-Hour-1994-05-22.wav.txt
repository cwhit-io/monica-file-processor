[time=0] God is in the character building business; God is desiring and thinking and contemplating
[time=13] and using the circumstances of your life, because he is deeply committed to building
[time=19] character. Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible
[time=35] study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=40] Thank you for joining us. Not too long ago, Harold Kirschner wrote a book when bad things happen to good people. It's old many copies because everyone wants to know the answer. Why do bad things happen to good people?
[time=55] Why is it that good people get cancer, go bankrupt, get smashed up in car accidents,
[time=61] get unfairly treated at work or even find that one of their children is experimenting with drugs. Perhaps even more important, how are we to respond to these trials? Is there
[time=71] a way to go through all these bad things and still maintain our joy?
[time=75] Today, Pastor Moore is going to address these questions, not from Harold Kirschner's book,
[time=81] but from a book God wrote nearly 2,000 years ago, the book of James. Stay with us for this insightful study from God's Word. Our special music today will be presented by
[time=92] the Sanctuary Choir in Orchestra and Brian Loewson. Let's join our service.
[time=122] [MUSIC - 60 seconds]
[time=212] [APPLAUSE]
[time=241] Learning as this morning, we'll return to the service in just a moment. But first, I want to tell you about a very special gift we're offering for the first time here on the Bible Hour for All Our Fathers. It's a beautiful hardbound book titled "A Father's Gift,
[time=256] The Legacy of Memories." This heartwarming book written by Ken Geier is our way of saying
[time=262] thanks to all our fathers for the love, hard work and dedication they give to their families
[time=268] every day. A father's gift takes a nostalgic stroll back through the author's childhood
[time=274] as he reflects on the many memories of growing up with his father. A father's gift is written in lyrical prose and will touch the heart of any reader who remembers just how really important fathers are. No doubt pictures of your own father will come to mind as you leaf through the pages, each one painting a different picture and reminding you at the same time of the unseen guiding hand of our Heavenly Father. The Bible Hour is offering
[time=299] this beautiful Father's Day gift free to all who write and request it. To receive a
[time=305] Father's gift, The Legacy of Memories, please write to the Bible Hour, 7400 East State,
[time=311] Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. That's the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
[time=318] 46815. Write to us this week, won't you? Now, let's return to our service.
[time=348] [MUSIC - 138 seconds]
[time=513] [APPLAUSE]
[time=519] Thank you again for joining us for the Bible Hour. Last week during the insert, I reminded you that we were going to continue a discussion with our friends Steve and Maria Gardner, and we're going to continue that right now. We talked about the album that's coming up called "The Eye of the Storm" and the concert, and we're going to tell the date at our church, but also Steve, you have other ministries, and you use this music all year long.
[time=544] Oh, yeah, we travel around the country. That's why we're not here every Sunday morning.
[time=548] We're here as often as we can be, but we're gone more than we're home, actually, and we sang for a variety of places. Last weekend we were in Pennsylvania. We sang at a college for an artist series, and we do quite a variety of things. Some of them directly related to youth for Christ, with whom we're associated, but the majority are churches, conferences.
[time=569] We'll be with the Graham Organization for a conference down in Louisville this coming month,
[time=576] and so a variety of things. Sounds like a very interesting itinerary. Yeah, it is.
[time=580] Maria, last week we talked about some of the songs. I'm always interested in why a musician
[time=586] sings one song over another. Tell me about another song that you're going to sing.
[time=590] Well, I think some of the greatest lyrics I've ever had the privilege of singing.
[time=593] Definitely our songs at Steve writes. He writes in a normal concert, he probably writes all but two songs in every concert, but he wrote a poem about the eye of the storm,
[time=605] and from that he and David took the words and they edited down to fit music.
[time=612] I mean, it's not every poem, can you just put to music? And this song talks about the fact that
[time=618] we as Christians, even though we're Christians, we still definitely go through times in our lives, and we're in a storm, and you feel that storm just whipp you, then all of a sudden, you know, you reach out to God when a storm hits. At least we should. At least I do, for sure.
[time=631] And I do all the time, but especially then. And we find ourselves in a real place of peace
[time=637] and comfort because he is there for us when we reach out to him.
[time=641] But it doesn't mean all as well. It doesn't mean the storm is over.
[time=645] And the storm just keeps moving and then hits you on the other side.
[time=648] So it just talks about the eye of the storm and a place of comfort and peace with him.
[time=653] So you're saying that in spite of the fact that you're in Christian work, Steve, not all is just perfect harmony?
[time=659] Yeah, I would like to think that most people these days have been around enough to know
[time=666] that they're not the only ones who go through the kind of difficulties and pain that they go through.
[time=671] But it seems like we all fall prey to that. And so part of this whole album, the theme is not only reconciliation, but really one of the central themes of our ministry
[time=682] is wanting to be open and transparent with people about the struggles that we face ourselves because we're not that different, that there is hope and that so a number of the songs deal with issues like that.
[time=694] Now let me tell you again that we're going to have the premier concert of this brand new album called "The Eye of the Storm" on Sunday evening June 19th at 6 p.m.
[time=704] I hope you'll set that data side and come and see Stephen Maria give this marvelous concert.
[time=709] We look forward to seeing you.
[time=724] [MUSIC - 172 seconds]
[time=909] [MUSIC] Calvary's love [MUSIC] Has never faltered [MUSIC] All its wonders [MUSIC] Still remain [MUSIC] So still take [MUSIC] Eternal passage, sins are taught [MUSIC] And heaven did, sins are taught [MUSIC] And heaven did [MUSIC] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh [MUSIC] Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh â™ª
[time=1026] - Let me invite you to take your Bibles and come to the Book of James.
[time=1031] They're in the New Testament, the Book of James, and we, not too long ago, finished a study in the Book of Philippians, and we've spent several months in some topical studies, and I'd like to this morning invite you to begin with me a study of the Book of James that will take us through the summer, I would imagine.
[time=1050] James chapter one, and let me just read the first four verses, which I'll be our focus this morning.
[time=1057] James, a bond servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the 12 tribes who are dispersed abroad, greetings.
[time=1066] Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance, and let endurance have its perfect result that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
[time=1084] The other day I was in the garage working on a few things, and my eldest daughter Randy, who's 12, almost 13, came into the garage, and noticed this kind of this old box where we keep a bunch of old athletic stuff, and there was a golf club in there and a golf ball, and she whips that thing out and the ball, and says, "Dad, I'm gonna be in the front yard "kind of hitting this ball around." I said, "Okay, that's great.
[time=1109] "Now, Randy, remember one thing, "these golf balls are very, very hard, "and they will break whatever they run into." She says, "No problem, Dad, I got it, boom, she's gone." I work a few more minutes, and before you know it, she comes back around the corner, and she says, "Hey Dad, "any chance we could go to the front yard "for a few minutes?" And I said, "Sure." And we come around, and I don't really know what's up, but she says, "Well, I was over there, "about 20 yards away in the front yard "by the lamp post there, and I just hit the ball." And then she kind of looked.
[time=1141] And right there, her bedroom window has this hole in it.
[time=1146] You know, it's double pane glass, and so the outside pane is broken, and all the glass is basically falling inside.
[time=1153] And I think she made a pretty good shot, actually.
[time=1156] It was a long way away.
[time=1157] She must have drew it a little bit, hit the trunk of this tree, and threw it immediately left into her own window.
[time=1163] And I was battling the temptation to say, "Hey, nice shot." (audience laughing) It really wasn't upset.
[time=1171] Just thinking about a great opportunity here.
[time=1173] And so I said, "Man, that's quite a hole there "in that window.
[time=1176] "You know, that's gonna be expensive." She says, "Well, I guess so." And I said, "Well, I think you're gonna probably "just go right ahead and pay for that.
[time=1185] "But what you need to know about my daughter, Randy, "is she is a saver.
[time=1188] "She's not a spender.
[time=1189] "She's not one of these shops 'til you drop people." She is like, I think she has every dollar she's ever made.
[time=1194] She's ever gotten for good grades.
[time=1196] She's ever received for Christmas present.
[time=1198] She's got this bank account down here at NBD.
[time=1200] It's probably bigger than mine is, and she just saves her money.
[time=1204] And so that took her back.
[time=1205] And she will like, "How much?" And I said, "I'm not sure.
[time=1209] "I think Mom had one fixer the day.
[time=1210] "Why don't you go check with her?" Well, she disappears again.
[time=1213] I'm back in the garage, and a few minutes later, she comes out and she says, "Dad, "Mom's thinking, you know, maybe like $200." She's got this long face on her.
[time=1224] (audience laughing) I'd say, "That'd be a lot, wouldn't it?" Oh, yeah.
[time=1228] As I'll tell you what, if it's that much, we'll split it with you.
[time=1231] We'll go 50/50, you take 100, we'll take 100.
[time=1233] And that didn't help.
[time=1234] She turned around and left.
[time=1236] (audience laughing) Well, there wasn't a lot of conversation about it throughout these intervening weeks.
[time=1242] Finally, the guy came, fixed the window, and this little saga continues.
[time=1246] She shows up, she finds me, and she has a bill for how much it cost, and she has her 100 bucks.
[time=1253] Now, the bill was $160, and so she's like offering 100, which I thought was good.
[time=1260] And I say, "No, no, well, let's just split it.
[time=1262] "How 'bout we go for 80?" And so she peels that off and hands it to me.
[time=1267] And I said, "Yeah, it's kind of a big moment in my life.
[time=1269] "I'm thinking, this is good." And I said, "Randy, you know, this is huge what you're doing.
[time=1273] "This is wonderful.
[time=1274] "I didn't bug you about this.
[time=1276] "You brought it back up, you pursued it, you found me, "you're giving me the money, either you're not complaining, "you know, you're not bitter about this.
[time=1284] "I don't sense any anger.
[time=1285] "I just, you know, somebody had a blow at Trump, "but we ought to have a band here.
[time=1287] "This is big, what you're doing is good.
[time=1290] "Randy, I'm proud of you." That didn't help either.
[time=1292] She turned around and left.
[time=1293] (audience laughs) All right, let it go for a few minutes.
[time=1299] And my heart, you know, I'm really struggling with this because we could pay for that.
[time=1303] We have a couple thousand dollars in our family budget for these kinds of contingencies, and easily could have covered that, would not have impacted us, one Iota.
[time=1311] And there's a sense, man, let's relieve her from having to go through this because she really does faithfully care for her finances, and she is a pretty good kid, if I don't say so myself.
[time=1321] And, you know, but no, we're gonna hang on, we're just gonna do this.
[time=1326] So I go into her room a couple minutes after that last exchange, and I notice that she's picking up her room and her backs to me, and she finally turns, and I can see now, these tears just running down her face.
[time=1338] And they're not tears of anger.
[time=1340] They're just the tears of having to go through a very difficult situation.
[time=1345] The man, I give her a big hug, and I said, I'm sure proud of you.
[time=1350] I think you're doing this right.
[time=1353] And walked out.
[time=1353] I tell you that whole story, 'cause I want you to get a perspective from heaven on how God is working in your life.
[time=1363] I believe God is doing the exact same thing in each and every one of our lives with the exact same motive.
[time=1373] God is committed to building your character.
[time=1377] God has set himself out on a mission to grow and strengthen your character.
[time=1383] And God, when you get into a difficult situation, whether it was your own sin, or whether it was just an innocent mistake, or whether it was somebody else's fault, God has the resources to bail you out.
[time=1396] So that you come out unscathed from the entire experience.
[time=1400] He's got all this stuff in the world, whatever it takes to free you from having to go through that, he's got what it takes to lift you out of it.
[time=1407] But I think you've noticed that on a regular basis, he chooses not to.
[time=1413] And instead of lifting you out, he comes alongside you, and he wants to help you work your way through that experience, because he's committed to your character.
[time=1425] Look at verse four, this is where this passage kind of leads to, at least this section of it does.
[time=1430] Let endurance, in other words, stay underneath that trial.
[time=1434] Let it have its perfect result.
[time=1435] Why?
[time=1436] That you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing, and we'll look at that before we're done today, but what he is saying is I want to grow you up into this phenomenal pillar of character strength where you can exude Christian character.
[time=1451] And it'll be true to say of you that you are perfect and complete, in fact you are lacking in nothing with respect to your character.
[time=1458] Well, just to get started, and for those of you who might be making an outline or taking notes this morning, let's do it this way.
[time=1465] I'm gonna give you two basic principles and then three points that come out of this message, or this passage.
[time=1472] Two basic principles and then three points that come out of the passage.
[time=1475] Principle number one, and you can take this one to the bank.
[time=1479] This will never disappoint you.
[time=1481] This will never let you down.
[time=1482] If you'll think this one through in terms of difficulty, it'll always do you right.
[time=1487] Principle number one is this, God is more committed to building character in your life than he is providing comfort in your life.
[time=1496] God is more concerned with building character than he is providing comfort.
[time=1503] In fact, you can scour the entire New Testament and you will not find one promise that God makes to his children in the vein of personal comfort, ease, smooth sailing, clear skies.
[time=1516] It's just not there.
[time=1518] You'll not find it.
[time=1519] But you will find over and over and over and over again a repeated promise to build your character.
[time=1526] He says in Romans chapter eight that all things work together for good to those who love him.
[time=1533] And what we wanna do is define the word good independently of the context of that passage.
[time=1539] We wanna say, okay, good.
[time=1540] I know what that means.
[time=1541] That means that my life works the way I want it to work.
[time=1544] That means comfort.
[time=1545] That means yeah, there may be some bumps, but it's gonna work out in a manner pretty consistent with what I think ought to have happened.
[time=1552] But if you look at that passage, you will not find that indicated anywhere.
[time=1556] In fact, he says, I am committed to building you into the person of Jesus Christ, to making you Christ like.
[time=1563] He's saying, I wanna give you the character of Christ.
[time=1566] That's his promise.
[time=1567] That's what he means by good because he knows that is your best good for you to have the character of Christ.
[time=1573] And his Holy Spirit takes residence inside of you to energize and activate the process of your having and growing and maturing in the character of Christ, not so that he can provide comfort in your life.
[time=1588] Principle number two, this also I believe is trustworthy.
[time=1594] The only way to Godly character.
[time=1598] The only way to Godly character, there is one road.
[time=1602] The only way to Godly character is through the right response to trials.
[time=1608] The only way to Godly character is through the right response to the trials that come into your life.
[time=1615] You've heard the expression, no pain, no gain.
[time=1617] That's a good expression, that works.
[time=1620] You want a beautiful garden?
[time=1622] It's not gonna happen unless somebody goes into the garden and pulls the weeds and cultivates the soil and plants the flowers and then faithfully nurtures them and waters them.
[time=1633] No pain, no gain, no work in the garden, no beautiful garden.
[time=1638] You want a little muscle tone?
[time=1640] You gotta sweat, you gotta work out, you gotta raise your heartbeat, you gotta pump some iron.
[time=1644] You gotta do those things on a regular basis.
[time=1646] If you don't do that, you will not have muscle tone.
[time=1650] Those are inviolable laws that God establishes in nature.
[time=1656] There are equally inviolable laws in the realm of the spiritual character of an individual.
[time=1663] And there is no Godly character without going through the pains of life with the right response.
[time=1670] It's not enough to go through the pains of life because you can do that with the wrong hard attitude and it only further entrenches and calcifies you in your bad character.
[time=1681] There's only one road to Godly character and it is this, the right response to the trials that come into your life, it was true even of Christ.
[time=1692] It was first good Friday and then Easter.
[time=1697] First pain, then gain.
[time=1699] First 33 years of being rejected by his own, living faithfully, living obediently, weeping, sorrowing, groaning and then finally ultimately he dies on the cross.
[time=1710] Pain, then gain, then his name is lifted up.
[time=1713] Then he is exalted into heaven.
[time=1715] Then he receives the fruit of his labor.
[time=1717] Even the son of God is subject to that principles, what I'm saying.
[time=1722] Don't think you're exempt.
[time=1723] So, because God is more committed
[time=1730] or concerned about your character than he is your comfort and because the only path to Godly character
[time=1739] is through a right response to trials.
[time=1742] James writes these several verses, verses two through four and so we'll look now three points.
[time=1749] Three things that James wants us to know about rightly responding to our trials.
[time=1754] The first is the inevitability of trials, the inevitability of trials.
[time=1762] You'll notice in verse two, consider it all joy my brother and when you encounter various trials.
[time=1767] He didn't say if, he could have, he didn't.
[time=1771] That'd be like saying to someone if you have to pay taxes.
[time=1776] No, no, no, no.
[time=1777] It's not a question of if, it's a question of when and how much, right?
[time=1782] That's what he's saying.
[time=1784] You don't say to somebody if you should happen to die.
[time=1787] It's not if, it's when and what type of death you're gonna have.
[time=1792] That's what he's saying.
[time=1795] It's not if you come into a various trial, it is when you come into various trials.
[time=1800] So don't panic when they come.
[time=1803] Don't think something has fallen apart in God's kingdom.
[time=1808] It is simply par for the course.
[time=1810] Trials come into your life.
[time=1811] It is par for the course.
[time=1813] Let me give it to you in this analogy.
[time=1816] You're trying to fly into some airport on the east coast and it's sucked in.
[time=1821] Absolutely sucked in.
[time=1823] Guess what happens?
[time=1824] All those jets that are supposed to be landing about every three or four minutes, they gotta start circling and they're in holding patterns all around that great metropolitan area.
[time=1833] They are just waiting to land.
[time=1837] They are waiting to make their final approach when the weather clears.
[time=1841] You know what's circling around the rest of your life between now and the time you're gonna die?
[time=1848] They're just out there.
[time=1849] You don't know their names and you don't know the cargo they carry but he's telling you, I guarantee you they're in holding patterns, they're out there and they're waiting to start their approach and they're just gonna land the rest of your life.
[time=1860] Trials are on their way.
[time=1861] Jesus said this, in this world,
[time=1867] you will have tribulation.
[time=1869] Paul said through many tribulations, we must enter the kingdom of heaven or the kingdom of God.
[time=1875] David said many are the afflictions of the righteous.
[time=1879] Job said man's days are short lived and full of turmoil.
[time=1885] Peter said it this way, don't think it's strange.
[time=1888] Don't think it unusual, the fiery ordeal that has come upon you and he uses that terminology, fiery ordeal because he's focusing in on the refining power of these trials in your life to burn away the draws from your life.
[time=1904] Don't think it's strange when those show up as if something unique or weird has occurred par for the course.
[time=1910] Consider it all joy, my brother, and win.
[time=1912] Not if you encounter various trials.
[time=1915] The word various in the Greek is the word from which we get our English word, polkadot.
[time=1920] Various trials, polkadot in trials.
[time=1922] They come in all shapes, sizes, varieties, and intensities.
[time=1926] Your life, in other words he is saying, is just gonna be dotted with trials and struggle because we are fallen people, though we are redeemed and we are living in a fallen world and that's what happens.
[time=1939] That stuff just happens.
[time=1941] Just so you don't feel alone in your trial.
[time=1945] This week we are praying for these kinds of things in our church.
[time=1949] We have a wonderful godly lady who two years ago lost her eldest son to cancer.
[time=1956] And if that isn't enough, seven weeks ago she unexpectedly lost her husband to a sudden heart attack that took his life instantly.
[time=1968] That's a trial of one sort.
[time=1973] She seeks now the power of God to continue to live with purpose and strength as she continues to raise her two remaining children.
[time=1980] We're praying for a husband in our church who is going to soon lose his wife short of some type of miracle.
[time=1986] And he is wondering how he is going to raise his three sons
[time=1992] in her absence and where he's gonna get the strength to live without this woman he so passionately loves.
[time=2000] We're praying for a grandmother and a grandfather in our church who got the wonderful news that their second grandchild had just arrived.
[time=2009] A little baby girl but before too long there was a slight disfiguration in the skull which tipped the doctors off to the notion that the sutures inside their little skull were tightening too quickly and abnormally which might eventually greatly disfigure and possibly cause brain damage.
[time=2027] They had to consult a neurosurgeon.
[time=2030] So we go from the apex of joy and thrill to the grave concern over the health of a helpless little girl.
[time=2037] Trials.
[time=2040] We're praying for another young wife in our church who just recently has returned from a heartbreaking trip to the west coast where she had to recognize the death of her father, someone she desperately loved.
[time=2054] Close relationship.
[time=2058] Godly family.
[time=2060] She comes home to Fort Wayne only to find out that her husband's cancer has returned.
[time=2065] They have two kids.
[time=2068] We're praying for another family in our church, a young couple who saved and saved and saved and saved and strategized and planned and worked to venture into business on their own and things didn't go their way and now that nest egg is gone and their business is defunct and they're wondering how they're gonna go on.
[time=2088] Financially, emotionally.
[time=2090] How do you trust God when you thought he was leading you to do that stuff?
[time=2094] Trials.
[time=2096] We're praying for a father who's wondering how to properly care and discipline for his son who has been experimenting with drugs.
[time=2106] You see, they come in all different shapes and sizes and intensities, don't they?
[time=2110] And I believe with all my heart that if we just start right over here, you could all file your way to the pulpit and begin to say, this is the trial that I am either in or that I have just come out of.
[time=2120] It's not a question of if.
[time=2122] Now here's the interesting thing.
[time=2124] Everybody I've listed here, look at this.
[time=2127] No one is insulated from trials.
[time=2129] On this list, we have rich people and we have poor people.
[time=2134] On this list, we have educated people and we have uneducated people.
[time=2138] In this list, we have the employed and the unemployed.
[time=2141] We have the single and the married.
[time=2142] We have the young, we have the old.
[time=2144] We have the male, we have the female.
[time=2146] There is no hiding, there is no insulating.
[time=2148] There is no way to escape the reality that James is trying to get us to embrace.
[time=2153] It is a matter of when, my friends.
[time=2156] That's all it is, just a matter of when.
[time=2159] Some of us will be going through sweeping catastrophes in the next 12 months that knock our feet out from underneath us and leave us lying in the dust.
[time=2169] Others of us will never experience these sweeping catastrophes, but from time to time on a more than acceptable basis, we will be plagued by just one little thing after another that seems to upset the course of life.
[time=2185] So it's not will it happen?
[time=2190] It's when will it happen and to what degree in severity will this occur?
[time=2196] I believe he believes that's important.
[time=2199] So you can properly prepare yourself for one in the future and if you're in one, just back up and say, okay, okay, okay, I give.
[time=2205] This is just life.
[time=2207] This is just par for the course.
[time=2209] Point number two, point number two.
[time=2212] Your attitude toward the trial determines the outcome of the trial.
[time=2222] If you'll notice in verse two, there's a word there that is consider, consider.
[time=2228] He is saying in this word that we need to think, think this trial through and on the basis of that thought process, on the basis of that deliberate evaluation of your circumstance and your trial, choose the attitude of joy.
[time=2248] Now that is not to say that the trial itself produces the joy.
[time=2253] Hebrews 12 says that even discipline for the time seems sorrowful.
[time=2257] We are not some type of sadomasochistic group of people that can hardly wait for the next calamity to come into our life because we get some type of weird sadistic joy out of the problems that we experience.
[time=2268] He is not saying that the trial itself is joyful.
[time=2272] He is saying consider the truth that you know about the trial and what the trial can produce.
[time=2281] In other words, evaluate your options.
[time=2283] You can either see your trial as an enemy or you can see your trial as an ally.
[time=2291] Choose the notion, in fact, the reality that it is an ally and be thankful for it.
[time=2300] Know a level of joy for that trial.
[time=2304] Let's look at the first option.
[time=2307] If you consider and ponder, and even if you don't consider and ponder, but you decide this trial is my enemy, here's what you're in for.
[time=2317] It reveals that your commitment is not to character, but to comfort.
[time=2321] So you have immediately put yourself at odds with God's agenda in your life.
[time=2333] My friend's not a good place to be.
[time=2336] Bible says he opposes the proud.
[time=2337] In fact, it's said that later in this book.
[time=2339] When the cloud of trial comes into your life, you will experience a knee-jerk reaction, which many of us do, we will begin to question God.
[time=2349] If the trial is the enemy, then his wisdom is challenged, his love is under suspicion, and his righteousness is slanted.
[time=2356] In other words, you begin to allow your relationship with God to degenerate and you begin to think things about him which are not true.
[time=2362] And once your relationship with God begins to degenerate, I promise you, your human relationships will be right behind in the degenerating process, which will stick you in a place of lonely isolation.
[time=2376] Your spiritual vitality will be drained, your energy will be sapped, your desire to worship God will quickly fade and you will have no desire whatsoever to witness to other people about Christ.
[time=2390] Why bring somebody to a God who brings unwanted trials into your life, enemy, enemy trials into your life?
[time=2397] Why would you do that?
[time=2399] If your approach to the hardship of your life is my trials are my enemies, I hate them, I reject them, God somehow is not hearing my prayers, why tell anybody to come to that God?
[time=2408] So you become a Christian corpse, a Christian cadaver,
[time=2415] no love for Christ, no worship for God, instead an angry, bitter, self-pitting, self-destructive spirit.
[time=2422] That's all that ever comes out of taking your trial
[time=2428] as an enemy.
[time=2429] That's what he's saying, think this through, consider this.
[time=2432] You know, it's weird.
[time=2434] It's like we've got, I mean we, I mean we.
[time=2437] We've got this notion that we have an unalienable right to be happy.
[time=2442] Sometimes I think we believe the Constitution of the United States more than we do the word of God.
[time=2447] There is no promise of happiness as it would be circumstantially defined in God's word anywhere, at least not in the New Testament, under the Old Covenant, nation of Israel possibly, but not here.
[time=2460] And so somehow when the trial forms in our life,
[time=2466] we run back to the notion of the Constitution which says I have an unalienable right to be happy.
[time=2472] And then we put it in biblical clothing and say I have a biblical birthright to have calm seas and smooth sailing.
[time=2483] And there's this sense of indignation that fills our soul, how dare my life not satisfy my comfort requirements.
[time=2492] You know what we need to do for each other?
[time=2499] When we catch each other at these moments of great weakness and misunderstanding about the things of God and the truth about life.
[time=2507] When you have a friend that's in that condition, you need to come into that friend's life and gentleness and in humility and get next to them and say let me remind you of something in your own words and in your own way, God is more concerned about your character than he is about your comfort.
[time=2524] Which means that you should be more concerned about your character than your comfort.
[time=2532] Maybe one of the strongest acid tests we could give
[time=2538] for true Christian maturity is this, are you more concerned about your character development or your comfort zone?
[time=2546] That probably tells us a lot about our spiritual maturity.
[time=2549] Remind your friend that God has said in his Old Testament
[time=2555] in ways that we can understand anthropomorphisms where God condescends to describe himself as a mirror man even though he isn't.
[time=2563] God describes himself as being up in heaven searching to and fro across the earth, looking intently for someone who has a whole heart after God.
[time=2574] He has neither eyes nor a need to search.
[time=2576] He knows the instant condition of everyone's heart but in order to show you the longing of his heart, the desire of the heart, the passion in his heart for people who will love him faithfully in the comfort times and in the times of character building, the trial times.
[time=2592] He says that I search to and fro as if frantically looking hoping to find a heart that is wholly devoted to me.
[time=2599] God has not only committed the building character in your life, he's longing to fellowship with you in that place of your character.
[time=2606] And you know what else is true?
[time=2611] When God finds people like that, he uses them.
[time=2619] He is saying in effect to you this morning, if you will greet your trial, whatever it is, great or small as your ally instead of your enemy, and if you will stay under that thing and endure through its end, not only will it produce the virtuous character of Christ in your life, but I will use you in unique and marvelous ways.
[time=2643] I will send you down paths of great adventure for the cause of Christ.
[time=2648] I will lift you up out of the mundane realities of human existence and you will sense my hand upon your life and you will know that I am involved in the things you are doing.
[time=2659] It all begins.
[time=2666] And it only begins.
[time=2669] When you say about your trials, you are my friend.
[time=2673] You are my ally.
[time=2676] You are not my enemy.
[time=2677] You are welcome.
[time=2679] I greet you.
[time=2682] I embrace you.
[time=2683] I accept you.
[time=2686] Teach me, so that I can be used if God.
[time=2690] Suppose for example that you are into a little bit
[time=2697] of muscle tone and you go to the fitness center on a regular basis every single day.
[time=2703] And by the way, I think our country's completely out of balance on muscle tone, but we'll just use it.
[time=2709] And so there you are doing your regular 50 sit-ups, two sets of 25, on your incline board.
[time=2716] And one of your instructors or one of your friends happens by on this particular day with a 25-pound weight that's in a thin plate like they put on barbells and they just lay it gently on your chest at the beginning of your first set.
[time=2728] Enemy or ally.
[time=2733] It all comes down to why you're in the fitness center.
[time=2738] If you're actually in the fitness center to build muscle tone, that 25-pound weight on your chest will do exactly that.
[time=2746] It will help you do what you're there to do.
[time=2749] That's exactly what James is saying.
[time=2751] Make up your mind.
[time=2753] Why are you on the planet for comfort or for character?
[time=2757] Settle the issue.
[time=2759] Every time a new trial comes into your life, you're gonna have to settle it again.
[time=2762] Are you on the planet for comfort?
[time=2768] If you're in the fitness center for character, you might just make it a regular habit.
[time=2773] Then yourself to pick up the 25-pound plate, put it on your chest and do your sets.
[time=2778] He's calling us to consider, to make up our minds,
[time=2785] which choice is it?
[time=2786] Do you wanna take a path in the midst of your trial that compromises your character or one that strengthens your character?
[time=2795] And those are your only two choices.
[time=2797] If you take it as your enemy, your character will inevitably be canceled, excuse me, compromised.
[time=2802] If you take the trial as your ally, your character will inevitably be strengthened.
[time=2808] And there's no middle ground.
[time=2810] Let me be very practical.
[time=2813] Suppose we've got a trial in our marketplace.
[time=2815] Suppose we have a boss.
[time=2817] Suppose we have a boss who is insensitive, he's rude, he's maybe a little incompetent, and he's cruel.
[time=2825] And you're thinking, we need to suppose.
[time=2828] Some of you have that, right?
[time=2829] You don't have to look very far to find one of those.
[time=2832] Is he your enemy or is he your ally?
[time=2835] Let's think about it.
[time=2836] If he's your enemy, you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning and you're going to go into work with a pretty nasty, bitter, angry attitude.
[time=2842] And I promise you, what is in your heart will eventually get out of your lips.
[time=2845] And so that's gonna leak out.
[time=2847] It's gonna affect the way you work, the quality of your service to that individual.
[time=2853] It's going to impact negatively your witness for the cause of Christ, for Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=2859] And it is also going to chew you up inside.
[time=2863] And we don't understand the connection between stress and our minds and the pressures we're under and how it messes up our physical bodies.
[time=2868] But we know there's a connection and you can count on an ulcer or you can count on your heart rate going up or you can count on something going on physically.
[time=2876] So it's a no-win situation.
[time=2878] It ruins you, it ruins your employer, it ruins your witness, it defames the name of God, there's just no winning down that path.
[time=2886] If you take your boss and the trial he represents as an ally,
[time=2892] listen to what might happen.
[time=2893] Your attitude changes, it's not easier, but you're not nasty and bitter and angry, you're submissive and willing and anticipating what God might teach you through this difficult situation.
[time=2905] You are sensing a new dependence in your relationship upon God for the strength to daily and even moment by moment make it and stay in a positive attitude of this trial is my ally, not my enemy.
[time=2920] Here are three great lessons you might learn.
[time=2922] One, you will learn to submit to authority which very few people have ever learned in their lives.
[time=2929] Two, you will learn loyalty.
[time=2932] Loyalty, despite your employer.
[time=2936] See, loyalty, when you give it to somebody who is worthy of loyalty, that's not a character strength, that's not a character quality, that's just called giving loyalty to somebody who deserves loyalty.
[time=2945] A true character strength is when you're loyal to somebody who doesn't deserve it.
[time=2950] You can develop the character quality, the Christian character quality of loyalty.
[time=2957] And here's another one, a last one, a third one, you will learn to confront in a meaningful way.
[time=2964] You see, your boss may need some help.
[time=2966] He may need somebody who properly submits underneath him, stays loyal, and at the right place, in the right time with the right attitude, makes some suggestions about how he's being experienced by the other people.
[time=2979] You might in fact be the one person who leads him to the Lord.
[time=2982] If you approach him as an enemy, and if he represents an enemy trial in your life, you'll have totally lost your credibility and any position and any hope of leading this guy to the Lord.
[time=2994] Or this woman to the Lord, if she happens to be a female.
[time=2997] That's what he's saying, consider will you please?
[time=2999] Will you please think through the reasonableness of adopting an attitude of joy in the midst of your trial?
[time=3006] Because to do otherwise is only self-defeating and self-destructing, but if you'll just submit to God's will and his way in your life, there's all kinds of manifold fruit that can be born in you, in this church, in other people's lives, all for the glory of God.
[time=3020] Makes a lot of sense.
[time=3023] The third principle is the product.
[time=3026] The product of rightly responding to your trial is character.
[time=3030] And that's kind of beating a dead horse, but that's what it is.
[time=3035] Look at verses three and four.
[time=3038] If you'll count at joy when you encounter these various trials, verse three, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
[time=3045] And let endurance have its perfect result that you may be perfect and complete lacking in nothing.
[time=3051] Two interesting words here, I've never seen this before this week, perfect and complete.
[time=3055] They mean two different things.
[time=3057] First, perfect.
[time=3059] It doesn't mean absolute perfection.
[time=3060] It doesn't mean you can finally get to a place where you never sin again.
[time=3063] That's heresy.
[time=3064] The Bible says, if you say you have no sin, you're a liar and the truth is not in you.
[time=3067] That never occurs here on earth in anybody, except always in Christ.
[time=3072] So what does it mean?
[time=3073] It means to move from babyhood to adulthood to a place of maturity, to a place of consistency.
[time=3081] So what does it mean in this context?
[time=3083] It's character qualities.
[time=3084] Let's take honesty.
[time=3085] When you become a perfect person in the category of honesty, it means that you are always honest.
[time=3091] In other words, that character quality has full sway over every area of your life.
[time=3097] You're honest with your kids.
[time=3101] You're honest with your unsafe friends.
[time=3102] You're honest with God.
[time=3104] You are thoroughly honest.
[time=3105] That's what it means.
[time=3106] You are mature.
[time=3107] You are perfect.
[time=3108] The other word complete means something different.
[time=3111] It was used of animals who would be inspected before they were sacrificed to make sure they had all their parts.
[time=3117] All their ears, all their eyes, all their feet, all their whatever they had.
[time=3120] In other words, they had everything they were supposed to have.
[time=3123] So what does it mean in this context?
[time=3124] It means you'll have all of the character traits that God wants you to have.
[time=3127] It'll be a full-orbed character.
[time=3131] In other words, you won't just be strong in honesty and faithfulness.
[time=3134] That means you're perfect in those areas.
[time=3137] It means you'll have the full range of character.
[time=3140] Listen to just a few.
[time=3141] Perseverance, courage, forgiveness, honesty, dependability, gratitude, self-control, humility, responsibility, contentment, gentleness, generosity, purity, availability, peace, compassion, initiative, diligence, thoughtfulness, discretion, joy, optimism, obedience, reverence, faith.
[time=3159] You'll have them all.
[time=3162] You'll be complete.
[time=3164] What's it say in verse four?
[time=3165] You'll be lacking in nothing.
[time=3167] You'll have all of the character qualities in a mature fashion.
[time=3172] And so that all those character qualities will influence all of your life.
[time=3175] That's what happens.
[time=3179] And the only possible way to move to that point in your life is by properly responding to the trials when they come.
[time=3190] That's it.
[time=3191] You'll never make it to that point without that truth.
[time=3194] In conclusion, think about it this way.
[time=3198] Some of you are saying, "Yeah, okay, I buy it." You don't understand, man.
[time=3200] I've been in this trial forever.
[time=3202] Noah, 120 year character lesson, building a boat so that we wouldn't drown when it rained.
[time=3212] And it never rained before in the history of the world.
[time=3214] And he's saying to all of his mocking neighbors, "Not only is it going to rain, it's going to rain so long that if you don't get in my boat, you're going to die." He had to go through that process for 120 years.
[time=3227] Moses went to school for 40 years in the desert before God used him.
[time=3233] Paul's entire Christian life was one trial after another, beatings, imprisonments, misunderstandings, scourgings getting thrown out of town, being pursued for death.
[time=3246] Just one long process of rejection and trial and physical trauma.
[time=3251] But here's what I like about all this.
[time=3257] Do you realize that we are in a character crisis in America?
[time=3262] We can't find anybody with character anywhere.
[time=3267] We can't find them in our politicians.
[time=3270] We're having trouble finding them in our law enforcement agencies.
[time=3273] We don't find people with a lot of character in our law offices, in our presidents of companies.
[time=3279] We don't find it even in the lower echelons, economically, of our country, in the slums of America or the fun. We just don't have any character anymore.
[time=3286] It's gone.
[time=3287] Not to mention the church.
[time=3293] You look at the church and we have a character crisis from the top echelons of pastors and elders who are compromising themselves sexually and financially and it's getting splashed all over the news back down into the rank and file of Christianity where the divorce rate inside the church is as high as it is outside the church.
[time=3310] I mean, it's just a wholesale character crisis era, which means, which means that if we begin to choose character over comfort, we will become truly remarkable people and people will begin to remark about us and our God.
[time=3332] We will stick out like sore thumbs, refreshing exceptions to the rule
[time=3342] all because of our character.
[time=3344] - What a privilege it is today
[time=3358] to have you watching the Bible Hour.

[time=3426] I'd like to take a moment and pray this prayer with you.
[time=3429] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I could come to you at any time and I could tell you that I've sinned against you and I'm sorry for the sins that I've committed.
[time=3438] I ask you to forgive me of my sins and come into my heart and be my savior today.
[time=3444] In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
