[time=0] In verses two to four, James has laid down the foundational truth about how to respond
[time=8] to trials when they come into your life.
[time=10] Respond with joy knowing that they can produce the most valuable commodity of all.
[time=16] Godly Christian character.
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=37] Thank you for joining us.
[time=39] When trials come our way, God calls us to rejoice because trials have a perfecting purpose in our lives.
[time=46] If you have been a Christian very long, you no doubt have been taught this great truth.
[time=50] The question remains, however, how do I do that?
[time=54] Sounds like it's easier said than done.
[time=57] In today's message from God's word, Pastor Moore explains the dynamics of being able to hang on through a difficult trial, how to pray about the trial, how to gain a proper perspective on the trial, and what to expect as the ultimate outcome of the trial.
[time=73] Our special music today will be presented by Susan Stump.
[time=79] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=90] Who fill the sky with raguest stars to glorify the light?
[time=113] Who knows of God that leads up to a dwelling place of light?
[time=271] Thank you for joining us this morning.
[time=286] We'll return to the service in just a moment.
[time=289] But first I want to tell you about a very special gift we're offering for the first time here on the Bible hour for all our fathers.
[time=296] It's a beautiful hardbound book titled of Father's Gift, The Legacy of Memories.
[time=302] This heartwarming book written by Ken Geyer is our way of saying thanks to all our fathers
[time=308] for the love, hard work, and dedication they give to their families every day.
[time=313] A father's gift takes a nostalgic stroll back through the author's childhood as he reflects on the many memories of growing up with his father.
[time=322] A father's gift is written in lyrical prose and will touch the heart of any reader who remembers just how really important fathers are.
[time=330] No doubt pictures of your own father will come to mind as you leaf through the pages, each one painting a different picture and reminding you at the same time of the unseen guiding hand of our Heavenly Father.
[time=342] The Bible hour is offering this beautiful Father's Day gift free to all who write and request it.
[time=348] To receive a Father's gift, The Legacy of Memories, please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East
[time=354] State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=358] That's the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.

[time=365] Now, let's return to our service.
[time=378] Welcome home, Christ, wait alone, in the dark of the light.
[time=397] It's time we went beyond the walls of our own hands, it's time we breached the distance,
[time=407] it's time we heard the cries one by one, and in, far too hard, oh we've got to understand,
[time=425] there's so much more to life than living day to day, we've got to make a difference,
[time=436] we've got to make a way, let's be the hands, let comfort every cold and lonely man, let's
[time=448] be the feet for those who do not have the strength to stand, let's be the love that reaches out
[time=458] to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach around the world.
[time=475] In a world full of fear, there's still hope, and the answer is clear, inside our souls
[time=496] we've got a powerful arm above, a special kind of courage, a special kind of love, let comfort
[time=512] every cold and lonely man, let's be the feet for those who do not have the strength to stand,
[time=523] let's be the love that reaches out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach
[time=533] around the world, we can make it happen, we can see it through, if we can learn to love
[time=551] our brother, there's nothing we can do, no there's nothing we can do, let comfort every
[time=559] cold and lonely man, let's be the feet for those who do not have the strength to stand,
[time=568] let's be the love that reaches out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach
[time=598] our brother, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms
[time=609] that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and
[time=617] girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that
[time=623] reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and
[time=635] girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl
[time=646] that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and
[time=652] girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl,
[time=664] let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and
[time=698] girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that
[time=705] reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's be the arms that reach out to every boy and girl, let's just sing and want to be a part of a choir, they had met with our music director, visited our facilities, seen our financial aid packages, had piled back into their car, Mr. and Mrs.
[time=728] Romanowski and their son David in the front seat, the two foreign exchange students in the middle seat and then in the station wagon, that back seat that faces the other way, they're two daughters, they had no sooner left the master's college and headed east about two miles but they came to an intersection and Mr. Romanowski, who has only one eye, did not
[time=748] notice that they'll license to drive automobiles of course but did not notice that it was a
[time=754] red light not a green light and so he proceeded into the intersection, only to be struck there broadsided by a van that was going 60 miles an hour. Upon impact their car began to spin
[time=765] and the two eldest daughters were thrown out of the back window of the station wagon and
[time=773] lay there in the middle of the intersection near death. The two foreign exchange students
[time=780] were in critical condition, Mr. Romanowski stunned because the impact of the van came on his side of the car, sitting there hopelessly and hopelessly on the curb, his one, his glass
[time=791] eye having popped out, his other eye barely able to focus on the scene, noticing that his two daughters were lying in the middle of this god forsaken intersection and his wife bending over his daughters grieving their condition. The medical rescue teams were called,
[time=810] eventually the two girls were teleported to the nearby hospital but it was to no avail
[time=816] and their two daughters were actually dead on arrival. We sat there in our living room
[time=823] and tried to understand all of this, the two foreign exchange students were in critical condition in the hospital, their son David and the two parents basically unscathed by the incident. I remember Heidi and I going to bed that night really wondering what in the world we were going to do for the next few days feeling inadequate to cope with a situation like this and to help people grieve and what to expect. The next morning after breakfast we retired again to our living room and I said to Mr. Romanowski how are you doing and how can we help you and what are you feeling and he said frankly Russell we are rejoicing in God's plan for our life and that seemed rather odd even coming from a Christian
[time=865] even coming from a pastor Mr. Romanowski was. I said well how do you explain that? He said
[time=871] well it's very simple. Our two daughters were saved, born again and we brought them here
[time=878] to find which college they wanted to join so they could sing in a choir and God and His mercy has seen fit to take them home to heaven and graduate them from that experience and they are now members of the heavenly choir singing with voices that they could never have had had they stayed here on earth and knowing a joy and a thrill of worshiping God they could never have if they were still here on earth. He said and more importantly God
[time=902] took the right two people out of that car because the two foreign exchange students
[time=909] aren't saved. In fact that's why we had them in our home that's why they've been staying with us for the last year because we've been seeking to have a testimony for their salvation
[time=920] and we are thankful that God did not take their lives so that we could continue to have a
[time=926] witness and a testimony that maybe they'll come to Christ and when they die be in heaven.
[time=932] Actually rejoicing under those conditions as they chose to view that circumstance from that perspective. Now the world might call that perspective foolishness. They might even
[time=944] call it a kind of a sadistic perverted kind of foolishness that you would be thankful that your own flesh and blood is dead and that the others in the car aren't because they don't happen to share your religious beliefs. Others in the world might say that's
[time=959] a terrible case of denial and one of these days it's going to come crashing in on these people just how horrible the situation really is. But I want to know I want you to know something
[time=971] God calls that perspective not a perverted foolishness and not denial he calls it wisdom
[time=978] from on high. Wisdom from on high and it is that kind of wisdom from God. That kind
[time=987] of perspective that is required to live faithfully through the trials that God brings into your
[time=993] life. Look at verse five of chapter one you remember verses two three and four talk about
[time=999] trials and that we're supposed to respond in joy. And after laying that foundation that
[time=1006] trials are to be greeted with joy because they can produce character he then says in verse five but if any of you lacks wisdom let him ask of God who gives to all men generously
[time=1018] without reproach and it will be given to him. You see the question he takes up now in his
[time=1024] argument in chapter one is how do I stay obedient in this trial. You'll notice that
[time=1032] in verse three knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance have its perfect result. Endurance is a compound word in the Greek from Hoopa Menet. Menet means
[time=1043] to remain. Hoopa means to get under. It means to remain under the trial. In order for God
[time=1049] to produce the character in your life that he values and longs to see you and I have to be willing to stay underneath the trial and resist the temptation to escape out from
[time=1060] underneath it. And so he is now going to give us wisdom or instruction as to how to stay
[time=1068] under the trial for a long period of time until God removes the trial so that it can perfect
[time=1075] us in the way that he wants to perfect us. So the question he's beginning to answer is
[time=1081] how do I keep on responding to this trial in the right way? How do I hang on and see this thing through to the end? And that's a wonderful question because many of you who are here this morning are on the edge of giving up. Many of you who are here this morning
[time=1096] are ready to cash it in. To say I have reached the breaking point this trial has gone beyond
[time=1102] what is normal and natural and to be expected of any human being and I am ready to get out from underneath this trial. Many of you are in marriages which are very trying and for
[time=1113] months even years you have been painfully disappointed by the condition of your marital relationship. And you are very near the point where you are ready to say I have had it,
[time=1124] I'm out of here, it's over. I will not stay in these conditions any longer. In fact you
[time=1131] are beginning to build what sounds to you like a very reasonable and justifiable case for
[time=1137] your disobedience. Others of you are struggling to maintain your sobriety. You have struggled
[time=1146] with it in the past and by God's grace you are fighting your way day after day. In fact one day at a time to sobriety but it's hard and it's difficult and you feel the allure
[time=1157] of the escapism that exists there. Others of you are fighting an illness that's chronic
[time=1165] and there seems to be no relief in sight and you are in your mind beginning to say to yourself things like I have had it, it's gone on too long, this is too much, this is unreasonable, I'm out of here. Others of you are fighting loneliness. And in a few moments when this
[time=1182] service is over you are going to get up out of these pews and walk down that aisle into a parking lot full of people but you're going to know you're still alone. It's another Sunday afternoon and you're still alone. And you're going to be tempted to compromise your integrity
[time=1198] to solve that problem. Others of you are under financial pressure and you have overspent
[time=1204] your budget and you're in debt and you're in trouble and your business isn't doing what you thought it would and you're struggling to somehow hang on to your house just one more month and you're tired and you're ready to give up. Well for those of you who are
[time=1224] here today, with a heaviness of heart, with a sagging spirit and with a worn out will,
[time=1235] this passage is for you. This passage is all about how in the world do I stay underneath
[time=1241] the trial? How do I hang in there? How do I follow the path of obedience all the way
[time=1247] through this thing? Let me give you one principle as we start and then I thought I was going
[time=1256] to give you three points out of this passage. In the morning service I barely got through the first one. So how about one principle and one point? Here's the principle. Endurance
[time=1270] is the product of a godly perspective. Endurance through your trial is the product of a godly
[time=1281] or of a divine perspective. In other words, your endurance in the trial you are facing
[time=1287] right now is the product of your ability to continue to see your trial from God's perspective.
[time=1299] It's found in your ability to refuse to view your trial from any other vantage point than
[time=1306] the vantage point that God has for you in that trial. And so we come to our first point
[time=1312] this morning, we must be willing to cry out for the wisdom of God. Look at verse 5 again,
[time=1319] if you lack wisdom, that's almost a sarcastic statement because everybody does. Nobody has all the wisdom they need. It's almost as if it's saying because you lack wisdom in the middle of your struggle, in the middle of your confusion, when you're ready to question, when you're ready to doubt, when you're ready to give up, you lack wisdom, ask of God. And
[time=1338] by the way, let him ask of God is not a suggestion in the Greek language, it's written as an imperative command. Ask of God and the song this morning so appropriate. When the storm
[time=1350] is raging, he said, I fall to my knees in the face of the seas. Though my ship is being beaten
[time=1362] and my sail is being torn, I fall to my knees. Why? Because he is seeking wisdom from God.
[time=1372] And once the perspective of God reenters your trial, you are confidently reassured that
[time=1379] the anchor is holding. Let me put it to you this way. When you begin to adopt the woe is
[time=1391] me attitude in your trial, and everybody does that, all you have to be in is in a trial long
[time=1397] enough, and even the right shift's job begins to adopt the woe is me attitude. When you
[time=1404] lose your wisdom from God, when you lose your godly perspective, God becomes your enemy,
[time=1410] you become the victim, and relief becomes a justifiable, reasonable excuse for sin.
[time=1416] It always happens that way. And so the battle has to be fought in grabbing ahold of the
[time=1423] wisdom of God and seeing your situation from God's perspective. Take the Romanoscis, for example. He didn't have to choose to see it that way. He didn't have to take the wisdom
[time=1433] of God. He could have said this. You know, God, this is about, this is the end of the
[time=1441] line for us. I'm a pastor. I pastor in Utah, the middle of Mormon country. I get one convert
[time=1450] about every six years. The place is so overrun by that cult. We struggle week in and week
[time=1458] out with 75 people in a rented facility. I hear of other pastors and their success. I never see that stuff in my ministry, but I didn't quit and I didn't give up and I didn't get angry. I just stayed at my ministry. I stayed at my post. And in the midst of that
[time=1474] oppressive culture, I raised my family, and my daughters are saved. And they love you
[time=1480] enough to want to go to a Christian college, not BYU, not some secular college. They want
[time=1487] to go to a Christian college so they can learn to use the gift of their voice to sing your praises. And then my wife and I scrap tooth and nail day after day to find the resources
[time=1499] on a pastor's salary in a small church to provide the funding for such a private education.
[time=1505] And we do it. Week after week, we say no to our own desires. We drive an older car than
[time=1512] we otherwise could and refuse to buy new clothes and refuse to take weekends away. I mean, we sacrifice God so that we could provide this Christian education for our daughters.
[time=1523] And on the very weekend that we explore which college, in a lonely destitute, God forsaken
[time=1531] intersection on a hot Southern California day by somebody we don't even know. And using my own weakness, you draw me into the intersection and they're dead before my very eyes. I'm
[time=1542] out of here. I'm gone. I don't serve a God like that. I've had enough. You can just
[time=1554] take this ministry for yourself. Well, that'd feel good, wouldn't it? Isn't that how we're
[time=1563] tempted to think our way through our trials? The woe is me attitude. The woe is only me
[time=1572] attitude that would lead a person down a path of destruction and disobedience and rebellion
[time=1579] against God. That's why James says in verse five, man, when you're in the middle of a trial
[time=1586] and you're starting to lose your grip and you're not sure you're going to be able to stay faithful underneath this thing any longer. You've got to get down on your knees and you've got to cry out to God. God, please give me wisdom. Please remind me again. Show me a
[time=1600] new, help me understand, help me believe that what you are doing is good and right and that
[time=1606] there's a purpose in the middle of this thing. Because if you don't have that perspective,
[time=1612] you are on a path to disobedience, a path to rebellion. No wonder it was Solomon in first
[time=1622] Kings three, five who when God showed up to him, now check it out. God shows up and says, what do you want? Ask me for it. It's kind of like the rub the lamp three times, anything you need. Only it's not a weird genie. It's the true and living God. And Solomon says,
[time=1637] you know what? I've been made the king of Israel and I'm supposed to judge these people in truth and righteousness and I don't even know how to come in and go out, which was his way of saying, I don't know how to solve these problems. He says, God, please give me wisdom. God, please give me wisdom. And a lot of us would look at that choice and
[time=1659] say, you know, you really settled for second best. You could ask for something a whole lot more valuable than that. But Proverbs three says this about wisdom, how blessed is
[time=1668] the man who finds wisdom and the man who gains understanding for its profit is better than
[time=1675] the profit of silver and it's gained than fine gold. She is more precious than jewels and then it adds this phrase, which just drives deep into my heart and nothing you desire compares
[time=1687] with her. In other words, wisdom is so valuable and he tries to tell you more valuable than silver, more valuable than gold, more valuable than jewels. But just in case you're not into that stuff, whatever it is that you're desiring, wisdom is more valuable because
[time=1707] it allows you to gain the perspective that grants the power to chart a course in life
[time=1714] that stays obedient to the purposes of God. So cry out for it, cry out for it. I don't
[time=1726] know what your trial is this morning. Some of you may not be in the middle of one, but many of us are. And so I have gone through the Word of God and looked for the purposes
[time=1735] of trials, the wisdom of trials. I've got seven of them here I'd like to share with you this morning. And I'm inviting you, not just to take notes on these, you may want to jot it down, but far more important than writing it down, just for this morning, would you please listen very carefully for which one of the seven or which two or three of the seven
[time=1755] may in fact be God's purpose in your trial? And when you hear it, would you please latch
[time=1763] on to it with all you've got and say, God, that's it. That is why I'm in this trial.
[time=1768] And walk out these doors with renewed commitment to stay underneath your trial and to stay obedient
[time=1777] and to let it have its perfect work to produce the character which will glorify God.
[time=1783] Which of the seven is you? Please, in the integrity of your heart, engage with each one and let God
[time=1789] speak to you this morning in the privacy of your own spirit. He says he'll do that. Verse five,
[time=1795] if you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all men generously without reproach, it'll be given to you. Here's number one. Here's number one.
[time=1807] Sometimes God brings trials to reveal the condition of our own heart. To reveal the
[time=1814] condition of our own heart and the Old Testament, you don't need to turn their second chronicles 32-31. One of God's men, Hezekiah, is king of the people. And he's in a pickle. He's in a bind.
[time=1827] He's caught. He's trapped. It's a trial. And I don't have time to develop it for you, but he's hurting like a bid bag dog and he's crying out for relief. But he doesn't get it. You want to know
[time=1838] why? Listen to this. God left him alone. This is a quote from 2 Chronicles 32. God left him alone
[time=1846] only to test him that he might know all that was in his heart. That he, not God, God knew all that
[time=1854] was in his heart. That Hezekiah might know all that was in Hezekiah's heart. God already knew.
[time=1863] Hezekiah needed to know. And the heart is deceitfully wicked. And we are so capable of
[time=1869] self-rationalizing and self-justifying and self-defending and lying to ourselves that sometimes God needs to bring a trial into our life so that that trial will test us and
[time=1880] assist us in self-examination. If you're in a trial right now and you're feeling full of anxiety
[time=1886] and fretting, it's clear you're not trusting God like you could. Your heart is not wholly committed to trusting God. You might not otherwise know that without that trial.
[time=1895] That allows you to repent. That allows you to acknowledge and confess your lack of faith and your lack of trust and beg out to God for the strength to be more trusting and say, "Okay, this is the path we're going to learn trusting in." If you're in a trial today and you find yourself
[time=1911] accusing the character of God or questioning his faithfulness, God is wanting to reveal then for
[time=1918] your benefit the fact that you do not have the kind of confidence in the person and the nature and the power and the work of God. What better thing could you learn about yourself? Confess that,
[time=1929] know that he wants you to confess that, know that he brought you into that difficulty so you could sense that weakness in your character, in your heart, confess it and say, "Oh God, please,
[time=1940] let's work together to change this." Another reason, number two, God brings trials into our lives to
[time=1947] humble us, to humble us. If anything, man is prone to its pride. My lands, it happened with Satan,
[time=1957] it had, Lucifer, it happened with Adam, it happened with Eve, the Titanic self assertion,
[time=1963] "I can be like God. I'm not a dependent creature who needs to humbly submit to the will of an awesome creator. I can take control of my life. I can live the way I want to live." Pride.
[time=1974] The Apostle Paul teaches us this principle when he says, "You know, I was given all these revelations."
[time=1981] He saw Christ three times after his ascension, personally in a vision.
[time=1986] Christ endows the Apostle Paul with this awesome mission to the Gentiles, and to make sure it's successful, he gives the man power to do signs and wonders, big time miracles at the drop of a hat
[time=1997] came off of Paul's ministry. I mean, he could just touch people, he could look at people, he could give him his handkerchief, they go with it and get healed. He was known all around the region
[time=2007] by his unique power to do signs and wonders. He wrote most of the New Testament. That could get a
[time=2016] little heady. You could begin to think you're a little something special. So what does God do?
[time=2020] He brings a trial. Let me read you 2 Corinthians 12 verse 7. And because of the surpassing greatness
[time=2029] of the revelations, this is Paul speaking, "For this reason to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, to keep me from exalting myself. My friends, this trial that's in your life may be there because you are prone
[time=2043] to be proud. And when you're proud, you're humble and you're going to hurt people and you're going to hurt your relationship with God and you're going to hurt yourself. And God's longing is for
[time=2053] you to be a broken, contrite spirit with a simple humility before him, humbly seeking to worship him
[time=2060] because he knows that you are best foot forward. He brings trials into your life to break you down
[time=2068] and humble you in ways that you would not otherwise be able to do for yourself. Is that what he's
[time=2074] doing in your life today? Is the Spirit putting his hand on that one for you?
[time=2080] Here's a third one. To wean us, to wean us from worldly things.
[time=2093] You know when things are going well and the seas are calm and it's smooth sailing, man we can really fix our attachment on the things of this world. We can really begin to focus on the
[time=2105] material things, our houses, our cars, our bank accounts, our hopes for retirement, the trips we
[time=2111] want to take, the vacations we want to have. Nothing wrong with any of that stuff. God, it says in the first time of these six gives us those things so we can enjoy them. The problem is we're prone to begin to worship those things and live for those things and let those things define
[time=2127] our existence even though in our heads we know we shouldn't. We have this propensity to go in
[time=2133] that direction and so God brings a trial into our life and when we're hurting I mean a trial
[time=2139] like when your daughter you get a phone call and your daughter's just been killed in a car accident or your wife has just been murdered by some drug addict that broke into your home or your
[time=2149] husband has just learned he has a brain tumor that's fatal. You see when God brings that kind of stuff into your life you suddenly realize that the things in your life aren't enough. You talk to
[time=2160] anybody in that situation they'll give you anything they own to get their daughter back, to get their wife back, to get their husband healthy. They'll give you anything they own because none of it solves the problem in their soul. Sometimes God has to bring a trial in order to reveal to us just how
[time=2177] temporal and flighty and insignificant those physical things are.
[time=2181] Moses is a great example of that. Let me read to you. You might jot it down. Hebrews 11, 24 and
[time=2191] following. Hebrews 11, 24. But by faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be called the son of
[time=2197] Pharaoh's daughter. Choosing rather, watch, to endure ill treatment with the people of God
[time=2204] than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin. Considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
[time=2210] treasures of Egypt. That's awesome. He's saying I came to the place in my life where I could see
[time=2216] through the superficial things of this world and by the way being the son of the daughter of Pharaoh is big stuff. It's privileged education, it's privileged money and political power and all the
[time=2227] pleasures the known world at that time had to offer. He had them. He said I considered the
[time=2233] reproaches, not the blessings, the reproaches of Christ as a greater blessing than the riches of Egypt. He was willing then to suffer ill treatment and identify with the people of God.
[time=2244] It's a huge value shift and sometimes it will not occur in your heart unless God allows you to
[time=2251] go through trials that open your eyes to that reality. Is that what he's doing in your life?
[time=2259] Number four, closely akin to this one I just mentioned but it's slightly different. It calls
[time=2266] us to an eternal hope. It calls us to an eternal hope. You want to hear about sufferings. The
[time=2276] Apostle Paul knew all about it. He says the passage I'm going to use for this is 2 Corinthians 4
[time=2282] verse 8 and then later verse 16 if you're taking notes but listen to what he's going through.
[time=2287] He says I'm afflicted in every way but not crushed. I'm perplexed but not despairing. I'm
[time=2293] persecuted but not forsaken. I'm struck down but not destroyed. I'm always caring about in my body
[time=2299] the dying of Jesus Christ. In other words my ministry as an apostle brings me into affliction,
[time=2306] into crushing, into persecution and into being struck down and he's even listed all those off in another place in one of his books. It's unbelievable in prison, its beatings, sickness, near death.
[time=2316] But you know what? You know what it's doing in his life? He's got the wisdom of God in his hand
[time=2325] and he's saying I know what this does. He says this in verse 17 for a momentary light affliction
[time=2331] is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison. And I look not at the
[time=2337] things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal. God through these trials cultivated in
[time=2348] the heart of his apostle Paul an eternal hope. He came to the place Paul did several times where he said I would rather be dead and be in heaven than live. Are you there? Are you there?
[time=2363] Is it true or are you just dying to live the rest of your life? You don't want the Lord Jesus to come back because you've got plans for this and plans for that and plans for this and plans for that. A lot of people don't have any hope for Christ coming back too soon. People who have been through trials, people who have been stripped by trials, people who have gone through hardship understand the emptiness of life, understand the vanity of life and say oh Lord Jesus come
[time=2387] quickly. I'm ready to get off this planet because I see it for what it is.
[time=2393] If you teary I'll live a vibrant strong Christian life for your glory. I'm your servant
[time=2403] but if I had my call if there was a button I could push that brought the second coming of Christ I'd
[time=2409] push it. I'm out of here. I've seen what this life's about because I've gone through trials
[time=2416] that's unmasked the facade. Is he trying to produce that in you?
[time=2423] If somebody were to come up to you in the privacy of your own home and you knew you could never be heard and say hey would you? Are you longing for Christ to come? Are you longing to be off this planet? Are you longing to be done with all this stuff and be in heaven? If you say no to that that may be why God has you in this situation because he wants to grow you up
[time=2444] to the wisdom of God, longing truly from your heart from heaven.
[time=2449] Number five he may want to be teaching us the value of the blessings of God, the blessings of God.
[time=2459] We are an ungrateful people. We have rising expectations. He establishes our standard of living,
[time=2468] he gives us our health, he gives us a church, he gives us a job and instead of just being
[time=2474] wonderfully and profoundly grateful for what he's given us we're saying man I want more.
[time=2479] What's next? Lord what are you bringing better into my life tomorrow and we can have the insatiable
[time=2487] wants of the consumer consume our relationship with God and so to teach us to be truly thankful
[time=2494] and grateful he brings hardship into our life and he takes a part of that away from us maybe our
[time=2500] health maybe our financial stability maybe our job maybe a spouse maybe a child he just takes one
[time=2507] small part of all of his blessings out of us or excuse me away from us so we can then see the rest
[time=2514] of them for what they are. Oh my land I don't deserve any of that stuff. I could be missing the
[time=2521] critical link in every category of my life. Oh look at the bountiful blessings of God.
[time=2526] I don't deserve any of this stuff. I shouldn't take any of it for granted. I don't I don't want any more than you've given me. Through trials God produces true genuine heartfelt gratitude for
[time=2538] his blessings. It says in Psalm 63, "because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips will
[time=2545] praise thee." Number six to enable us to help others who suffer to enable us to help others who suffer
[time=2558] do you know that if you have not suffered you are of little value to those who are suffering because they can tell you have not been through it and you don't really understand what they're
[time=2570] living but there are times when because you have gone through suffering
[time=2576] and you've moved through that trial effectively for God you've come out of that trial somebody
[time=2584] else falls into a trial you can touch and connect with them because they sent you've been there.
[time=2589] Our beloved associate pastor Chuck Frederick as you know many of you know lost his wife many many
[time=2599] years ago and God has since blessed him with Norma and that couple is just something to behold all that they enjoy in Christ. Not too long ago Jeff Carlson lost his wife
[time=2609] guess who got together guess who connected guess who ministered to each other guess who
[time=2618] walked through the door and could honestly say these words Jeff I know what you're going through.
[time=2624] I couldn't say that to Jeff. Chuck said that to Jeff we married Jeff yesterday to his lovely bride
[time=2633] Becky before we came in the door here Jeff was reflecting on what an incredible ministry Chuck
[time=2640] Frederick had in his life because he'd suffered maybe God is preparing you to minister to somebody
[time=2648] else maybe this isn't about you at all maybe none of these other points apply to you maybe those are doing well in your life but God needs an instrument that's refined and sharp and honed and capable of doing the job and he's elected you to be that instrument and so he throws you
[time=2663] into a trial so you can learn the inner workings of suffering so that you can then be the accompanying
[time=2669] helpmate of someone who's going to suffer soon. Principle number seven and lastly to give us a
[time=2686] platform for evangelism to give us a platform for evangelism Sue saying about it in her song
[time=2695] this morning when she's talking about putting our arms around the world and extending our self to people and a lot of times people don't want to be touched by Christians because they think we're fake and we're phony and we're trying to insulate ourselves in this crutch religion called Christianity but let me tell you something when you go through a trial and you go through it in a way that honors God and your comrades at work or the people on your block they see the stability and they see the strength and they see the purpose to rejoice and they watch the character grow you now have a platform to witness to them that you never had before in all your life.
[time=2729] Peter is the one who writes about this great noble purpose in suffering and both first and
[time=2737] second Peter are the books about suffering in the in the New Testament and right in the middle of his first book first Peter two nine let me read it to you he says that you may proclaim the
[time=2747] excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light it is through
[time=2753] your trial it is through your suffering that God lifts you up and you stand as a beacon of light and the unsaved world wants to know how is it that you do that where those friends come from that
[time=2766] comforted you ministering from time to time to our beloved Jack sailor who as you know is is dying
[time=2774] over this long course of time and it's without fail that the new nurse is overwhelmed by his
[time=2782] sense of stability in Christ overwhelmed by the people who flood to his home from this church
[time=2788] with joy in their faces and love in their hearts is without exception that those nurses first see the power of the gospel and then they hear it from
[time=2799] his lips and then in his suffering he lifts that nurse up day after day after day after day that
[time=2806] she might come to Christ enormous suffering he has gone through enormous platform
[time=2814] throughout the medical community for the power of the gospel so which is it let me review him please in your heart ask God to give you wisdom so you can be faithful so you
[time=2826] can continue so you can grab this this more than precious jewels thing and have it in your heart as you walk out of here today why does God have you in a pressure cooker today is it because he wants to reveal to you the true condition of your heart so that you can repent and ask him for help in the area of your weakness is it because you need to be humbled because there's a sense of autonomy and independence
[time=2851] and rebellion there that says I'll just live apart from that sweet spirited humility in God
[time=2858] is it because he wants to wean you from your affection to the things of this world which he gave only to be enjoyed not worshiped is it because he's calling you to an eternal hope and he wants to bring you to the place where
[time=2872] you could honestly say I'd rather be in heaven today than on earth tomorrow is it because he's trying to teach you the value of the blessings that he's already given you
[time=2883] and so he removes one or part of one so you can refocus on the wonder of those that remain is it because he's sharpening and refining you to be a tool for someone else's suffering
[time=2895] is it because he's wanting to put in you a platform for the gospel
[time=2907] well we're out of time look at James one just for one closing thought and this is so important
[time=2913] this is so important verse six let him ask in faith without any doubting
[time=2922] for the one who doubts is like the surf of the sea driven and tossed by the wind
[time=2929] but not that man expected he will receive anything from the Lord being a double-minded man
[time=2935] unstable in all his ways the double-minded man what that is is that's the man who is
[time=2941] divided in his mind he's an indecision between two competing desires he wants to go right but he
[time=2948] wants to go left he's too sold john bunion in his great classic pilgrims progress called him
[time=2956] mister facing two ways mister facing two ways there's a prerequisite to this wisdom in your life
[time=2965] he is saying yes ask but in verse six you got to ask in faith without doubting without being mister
[time=2973] facing two ways because if you doubt you'll be like the surf of the sea that's driven and tossed by the wind there'll be no stability to you and if you do ask in doubting verse seven don't expect to receive anything from the lord because you're a double-minded man and stable in all your ways again he calls you back to the point of making up your mind are you gonna trust him or aren't you gonna trust him when you come to god in the middle of your trial and you're ready to let go it starts
[time=2998] with an affirmation oh god i love you no matter what you do in my life oh god i'm gonna trust you
[time=3004] no matter what circumstances come my way oh god i want to be used by you no matter what it takes
[time=3012] you've got to give up the conditional aspect of your relationship with the lord you can't just
[time=3018] give him 80 percent he wants 100 percent of your heart your mind and your soul you come to him
[time=3024] asking in that kind of faith he's going to give you the wisdom to sustain your life don't play games with god don't play games with god don't come as mister facing two ways
[time=3042] come to him with a steady heart saying oh god if i don't get help from you there is no help
[time=3051] notice one last thought in james one you're gonna bump down to verse 12 for just a second
[time=3059] blessed is the man who perseveres under trial blessed is the man who perseveres under trial
[time=3065] this week i had a tremendous time in my office in a premarital interview and believe me all the times these are not always blessed because sometimes you see the bible says we can only
[time=3076] marry two believers and sometimes we end up with a believer and an unbeliever in our office and it's very touch and go there for a while sometimes we end up with two believers but we've got an unbiblical divorce in one of their backgrounds and they are not allowed biblically to be remarried and yet they're in love and they expect me to do their wedding some difficult times but this week
[time=3099] pure unadulterated joy i don't know why because somebody had the wisdom to persevere through an
[time=3107] incredibly difficult trial and because of that perseverance kept herself in the position of
[time=3113] obedience and is today ready to be biblically remarried let me give you the details this wonderful virtuous woman marries a man out of our church many years ago he taught in some of our sunny school classes he was known and respected as a godly man and she chooses him based upon his reputation and her knowledge of his love for god within several years this person begins to change and change radically almost like there's two of him
[time=3141] and suddenly his heart is growing cold against god and his heart is growing cold against her
[time=3147] and against their children and against everybody in his world and she goes through a three-year period that was getting up to this now three years of strong
[time=3158] suspicion that this man is being unfaithful to her being immoral committing adultery
[time=3164] and there's all kinds of little evidences of it some not so little being gone all night with
[time=3170] no explanation reports from other people indicating such a suspicion
[time=3177] this woman lives in absolute torment for three years I say how did you stay in it so long
[time=3185] she says oh I memorize James chapter one verse five if any man needs wisdom let him ask of god
[time=3194] and then I just went to the word of god for wisdom and I just would read through the psalms just devour the psalms and when I came to the passages that said my god is a rock and a shield and a defender and a refuge I'd write those on cards and stick them on my dashboard and stick them in my bathroom because my mind was so full of stress I no longer was able to memorize very many things anymore you know that point don't you well you're under so much pressure you can hardly think and she held on and was held on to by a group of fellow Christians
[time=3222] that would meet on a weekly basis and they would hold her up and pray for her and say be faithful don't disobey god's word you don't have grounds for divorce and she would at times come and say but I've got to get out of this but she didn't and eventually in god's timing and in god's way
[time=3243] he revealed so obviously this man's unfaithfulness that he was not only an adulterer but a homosexual
[time=3249] and a cross dresser and involved in unbelievable things a lefter and so with god's blessing
[time=3261] according to his word finds divorce from that situation biblical divorce grants biblical remarriage
[time=3269] so she and a young man who came to the Christ here three years ago
[time=3275] come to my office and say we'd like to be married and my resounding answer is you got it let's do it praise god and by the way how did you survive
[time=3291] let me glean from you woman of virtue how do you survive and her heart and her eyes were bubbling
[time=3301] over with what it said blessed is the man blessed is the woman who perseveres under trial
[time=3308] you see she stayed in it and she stayed obedient and got eventually resolved it and she stands
[time=3315] a blessed woman that means happy and we just had a wonderful time of fellowship and prayer
[time=3321] rejoicing in god's power my friend you got to recognize your relief may be just around the corner
[time=3330] don't give up embrace the wisdom of god for your trial and stand firm and endure through the end
[time=3338] you'll never regret it if she sort circuits that thing and divorces him without grounds
[time=3345] that union the one we're talking about now could never occur well i've run a little long let's stand for closing
