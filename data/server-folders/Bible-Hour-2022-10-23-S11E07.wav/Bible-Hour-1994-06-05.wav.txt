[time=0] When you're in a trial, and you don't obey the wisdom from God, and you choose to sin,
[time=9] don't then having sin stop and say, "God, this is certainly your fault.
[time=16] You have pushed me beyond my boundaries."
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=39] Thank you for joining us.
[time=41] We live in a society that is fast-rowing away the notion of personal responsibility.
[time=46] Moral responsibility is being replaced by victimization, which teaches people to blame someone else for personal failures.
[time=55] Instead of selfishness leading to willful acts of sin, our culture is busy talking about victims who've been so traumatized
[time=64] that they're no longer responsible for their own behavior.
[time=67] These victims are encouraged to think of themselves as patients rather than sinners.
[time=73] It's much easier to say, "I've been wounded and therefore have certain conduct disorders rather than admitting I've sinned."
[time=81] From our study of God's Word today, we hear a vastly different message when you sin, blame no one else but yourself.
[time=90] Any other explanation is nothing more than self-deception.
[time=94] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=111] Jesus, just to see the precious name of Jesus.
[time=125] Fears all seek a place to hide the weeping of my life since I've fought a hunger just to know.
[time=136] I miss Him in His name again.
[time=143] His name is a strong tower, a solid rock in a troubled man is a strong tower.
[time=154] Standing firm by the tribal friend of the dills and the mountains, they walk away to the deep blue sea
[time=164] but the mighty name of Jesus will give our strength to me.
[time=171] Wherever we will be, we will be powerless when I'm trying.
[time=177] When you love, I need a place to find your rest.
[time=182] So my mind can be refreshed.
[time=186] I've got a mighty refuge, a solid rock I can run to.
[time=193] A sacred place I'll sort of do.
[time=196] Every time I see His name.
[time=202] Jesus, just to speak the precious name of Jesus.
[time=212] Fears all seek a place to hide the weeping of my life since I've fought a hunger just to know.
[time=222] I can see His name again.
[time=229] His name is a strong tower, a solid rock in a troubled man is a strong tower.
[time=240] Standing firm by the tribal friend of the dills and the mountains, can't fall away to the deep blue sea
[time=250] but the mighty name of Jesus will give our strength to me.
[time=257] Wherever we will be, we will be powerless when I'm trying.
[time=263] When you love, I need a place to find your rest.
[time=268] So my mind can be refreshed.
[time=272] I've got a mighty refuge, a solid rock I can run to.
[time=278] A sacred place I'll sort of do.
[time=282] Every time I speak His name.
[time=288] His name is a strong tower, a solid rock in a troubled man is a strong tower.
[time=299] Standing firm by the title friend of the dills and the mountains, can't fall away to the deep blue sea
[time=309] but the mighty name of Jesus will give our strength to me.
[time=316] Wherever I will be, we will be powerless when I'm trying.
[time=322] When you love, I need a place to find your rest.
[time=327] So my mind can be refreshed.
[time=331] Jesus is a strong tower, a Jesus rock in a troubled man.
[time=345] Jesus is a mighty mighty refuge, Jesus is a strong tower, a solid rock in a troubled man.
[time=353] Just to speak that precious name, here's a secret place to hide.
[time=360] Water come hard just to know, I can speak His name again.
[time=366] The mighty name of Jesus, the mighty name of Jesus, the mighty name of Jesus.
[time=373] The mighty name of Jesus will give our strength to me.
[time=381] [APPLAUSE]
[time=384] Thank you for joining us this morning.
[time=386] We'll return to the service in just a moment.
[time=388] But first I want to tell you about a very special gift we're offering for the first time here on the Bible hour for all our fathers.
[time=396] It's a beautiful hardbound book titled "A Father's Gift, The Legacy of Memories." This heartwarming book written by Ken Geier is our way of saying thanks to all our fathers
[time=407] for the love, hard work, and dedication they give to their families every day.
[time=412] A father's gift takes a nostalgic stroll back through the author's childhood as he reflects on the many memories of growing up with his father.
[time=421] A father's gift is written in lyrical prose and will touch the heart of any reader who remembers just how really important fathers are.
[time=429] No doubt pictures of your own father will come to mind as you leaf through the pages, each one painting a different picture and reminding you at the same time of the unseen guiding hand of our heavenly father.
[time=441] The Bible hour is offering this beautiful Father's Day gift free to all who write and request it.
[time=447] To receive a father's gift, "The Legacy of Memories," please write to the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=457] That's the Bible hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=463] Write to us this week, won't you?
[time=465] Now, let's return to our service.
[time=469] Let me invite you to take your Bible this morning and turn with me to the book of James.
[time=474] We're studying this book paragraph by paragraph and we're just in the first chapter of it,
[time=480] I think, into our third message on this book.
[time=484] And I guess the best way to get us started this morning is to think about a little sentence that's getting said more and more and more in our country.
[time=492] And it's this, "I am not responsible."
[time=499] I get set a whole bunch of different ways.
[time=501] I'm not responsible.
[time=503] There's no way I could be responsible for that.
[time=507] I am just simply not response able.
[time=512] There it is.
[time=514] I am not response able.
[time=521] Webster says it this way, first definition for the word responsible.
[time=525] Liable to be called to account as the primary cause.
[time=531] If you are responsible, then you are liable to be called to account as the primary cause
[time=537] for whatever happened.
[time=539] Second definition of responsible.
[time=542] Being the cause of explanation.
[time=546] Third definition, able to answer for your conduct.
[time=552] Response, able.
[time=556] More and more in America, people are claiming that they are not response able.
[time=563] They cannot be held accountable for their behavior.
[time=569] A drug dealer and cocaine addict from the Bronx says he is certainly not response able
[time=575] for the murder of eight children and two women whom he shot in the head at point blank range.
[time=582] Incidentally, the largest mass killing in New York since 1949.
[time=587] And jurors agreed when they decided that drugs and stress "were a reasonable explanation
[time=595] for his actions." They said the man "had acted under extreme emotional distress and the influence of drugs."
[time=606] So they found him guilty on a lesser charge that brought only a light sentence.
[time=611] You see, he was not response able.
[time=615] He was not able to respond properly to the situation because he had so many drugs in him and he was under such stress that he is released of responsibility for his behavior.
[time=626] Such was the case with Richard Bernzen, President of American University in Washington, D.C.
[time=633] He said, "I'm not responsible for making these many obscene phone calls to unsuspecting women."
[time=641] He said, "Because I am the victim of child abuse."
[time=647] And so the jury agreed and he received a suspended sentence and then went on to negotiate
[time=653] a multi-million dollar severance package from the university.
[time=660] A San Francisco City supervisor said, "I am not response able for the murder of a fellow supervisor
[time=667] and the then mayor George Moscone." Because, catch it now, I had too much junk food, especially hostess Twinkies.
[time=680] It made me act irrationally.
[time=683] Thus the famous Twinkie defense was born.
[time=687] "A lenient jury bought the line and produced a verdict of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.
[time=695] They ruled that the junk food resulted in "demonished mental capacity," which mitigated the killer's guilt.
[time=705] He was out of prison before the mayor's next term would have been complete.
[time=713] "I'm not responsible. I am not responsible."
[time=720] So said Musa Hanuki, an L.A. businessman, said, "I am not responsible for the brutal beating of my wife
[time=731] when I picked up a pipe wrench and beat her to death." Because, you see, I have been the victim of 25 years of husband battering.
[time=743] And besides that, I was caught in a religious web which would not allow for an honorable divorce.
[time=751] So I had no option.
[time=753] I am not responsible when I pick up the wrench, which he did, and beat her to death, which he did.
[time=760] The jury bought it four and a half years in jail.
[time=766] He'll be out soon.
[time=768] It's not your fault.
[time=770] Read the article title.
[time=772] "As a woman had written in to this particular newspaper for help because she couldn't break a self-destructive habit."
[time=781] Here it is.
[time=782] It's not your fault, then the columnist says I quote.
[time=786] The first step you must take is to stop blaming yourself.
[time=791] Your compulsive behavior is not your fault.
[time=795] Refuse to accept blame.
[time=797] And above all, do not blame yourself for what you cannot control.
[time=802] Heaping guilt on yourself only adds to your stress, your low self-esteem,
[time=808] worry, depression, feelings of inadequacy, and dependency on others.
[time=812] Let go of your guilt feelings.
[time=815] Now, that's a new twist.
[time=817] Not only am I not responsible for my self-destructive behavior, but because I'm not responsible, I should get rid of any feelings of guilt that I might have about what I just did,
[time=828] because that will only make my condition worse.
[time=831] I'll become less able to respond or be responsible for my behavior.
[time=836] A British magazine commenting on the condition of this situation in the United States of America called the Economist said this quote.
[time=843] If you lose your job, you can sue for mental duress of being fired.
[time=849] If your bank goes broke, the government has ensured your deposits.
[time=852] If you drive drunk and crash, you can sue somebody for failing to warn you to stop drinking.
[time=859] There's always somebody else to blame.
[time=863] He goes on, speaking about us.
[time=865] The irresistible search for someone or something to blame colliding with the unmovable unwillingness to accept responsibility.
[time=874] Now enshrined in law and jurisprudence, victimism is reshaping the fabric of society,
[time=881] including employment policies, criminal justice, education, urban politics, and in an increasingly Orwellian emphasis on quote-unquote "sensitivity" in language.
[time=893] We need to be very careful about how we talk to each other.
[time=896] A community of interdependent citizens has been displaced by a society of resentful,
[time=903] competing, and self-interested individuals who have dressed their private annoyances in the garb of victimism.
[time=911] End quote.
[time=914] What's the point? It's very simple.
[time=917] I am not response able.
[time=921] You see, I have been so victimized, I have been put in such a difficult situation,
[time=927] and it has had such a traumatic impact on who I am, that from that point on, I am no longer to be held accountable for my behavior.
[time=936] Somebody else is at fault.
[time=938] Whoever it was or whatever it was that victimized me, that is the culpable individual or circumstance.
[time=946] Victimism teaches people to blame someone or something else for their own personal failures and sin.
[time=954] Now, you've been hearing a lot about this. I can go on forever and ever. This is our day.
[time=957] This is who we are. This is the New America.
[time=962] Now, because we threw God away a long time ago, we stopped at just blaming people and circumstances,
[time=968] but in a religious society, we would ultimately blame who?
[time=973] God, the Greeks, seeking some way to shift ultimate responsibility for their behavior onto someone else,
[time=982] had Greek mythology, in which they invented a whole host of gods.
[time=986] And if you've read anything about it, you know that their gods are themselves sinful.
[time=991] The gods of Greek mythology not only understand sin, but dabble in sin.
[time=996] So the writings are full of incestuous relationships and greed and murder and intrigue in the realm of the gods themselves,
[time=1005] doing these things to each other. And then those very gods, so capable of sin, look down upon poor humanity
[time=1011] and use their superior power to orchestrate situations in which humanity is now tempted into sin.
[time=1017] And so the individual in society is released completely from any responsibility for their sin,
[time=1023] because the ultimate authorities are sending and, in fact, using their power to bring me to sin.
[time=1030] So it is even, dare I say, in Christianity.
[time=1035] We, rightly so, have a very strong understanding of what the Scripture says about the sovereignty of God
[time=1042] and the omnipotence of God, and the omniscience of God.
[time=1045] In other words, he's all powerful. He knows everything. He's in total control.
[time=1051] Therefore, if I have been put into difficult circumstances in my past, or if I am in difficult circumstances in the present, God, out of which I then choose to sin,
[time=1062] seeking relief from the hardship in which I find myself, God is ultimately responsible.
[time=1069] Because he's in charge, and he's all powerful, and he's all knowing.
[time=1076] And that is exactly the issue that James is addressing for us today in this passage.
[time=1081] And that's kind of the beauty of following the text like we are here through this study.
[time=1085] Watch the flow here. Back up in verses 2, 3, and 4, we find ourselves in the midst of trials.
[time=1090] Now the word trial is the biblical word for what everybody else is calling victimization.
[time=1095] In other words, anything that has happened to you that you didn't want to have happen, the world calls, makes you a victim for it, and the word of God says you just walked into a trial.
[time=1106] So that includes child abuse. That includes verbal abuse. That includes wife beating, husband beating,
[time=1113] cancer, any type of disease, any type of car accident, going bankrupt.
[time=1117] Anything you can possibly conceive of that's happened in your life that you don't like is called a trial.
[time=1124] There's nothing outside that. You don't like it. You don't think it went the right way? It's called a trial.
[time=1129] Now, of course, in our day, we call it you have been a victim.
[time=1133] And there is some truth in that statement.
[time=1135] It is true that we are fallen people living in a fallen world, and things happen to us that shouldn't otherwise happen.
[time=1140] If we were in the Garden of Eden without sin, or if we were in heaven, a lot of this stuff wouldn't go on.
[time=1145] And God never fails to acknowledge that reality.
[time=1149] We get mistreated all the time. Unfair, unjust, inappropriate behavior happens to the Christian all the time.
[time=1156] That's why it says win, like big planes waiting to land through the fog, they're circling, and it's coming into your life.
[time=1162] No disputing that.
[time=1164] He goes in his progression of thought, then, to verses 5 and following, down through 12, and he says, "Because it's so hard, because it's so difficult to properly stay underneath that trial and let it produce godly character,
[time=1178] pray for wisdom.
[time=1180] Go to God with a whole heart, not double-minded, not being driven and tossed by the wind.
[time=1186] Go to God with sure convicting faith and say, "Oh, God, give me the wisdom, the practical skill of living to know how to stay under this trial,
[time=1195] so that it will produce the perfecting character you intend it to so that I can glorify your name."
[time=1201] So God not only does not mitigate the issue that trials come and that they're hard, he also says, "You're going to need help from on high to know how to negotiate the deep waters of trial and tribulation."
[time=1212] And he says, "I will give it to you." But now in verses 13 and following, there is the very real likelihood that you got into a trial
[time=1222] and you either failed to ask God for wisdom or failed to appropriate that wisdom by his divine resources,
[time=1228] and you have now sinned. You have stepped out from underneath the trial and set a foolish course of disobedience in your life.
[time=1235] And now what do you want to do?
[time=1237] You want to turn around, clench your fist in the face of God and say, "God, somehow this is your fault,
[time=1243] because you're sovereign, you're omnipotent, you're all powerful, you're all knowing, and you put me in that trial,
[time=1249] and it was too much for me, and it led me to this sin, and so you're at fault." James 1 verse 13, "Let no one say, when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God,
[time=1264] for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one."
[time=1270] Okay, do you understand the progression of this chapter?
[time=1273] Trials are coming, they're going to be hard and painful, they do however perfect you in character.
[time=1279] I'm sympathetic to that, I want to give you the wisdom you need, when you fail to call for the wisdom
[time=1285] and live the wisdom I give, and you fall into sin, don't turn around and blame it on me.
[time=1289] Let no one say, when he is being tempted, he is tempted by God.
[time=1295] So when you have been victimized, when you have been put into some great trial, when you have been the object of child abuse,
[time=1301] or the Holocaust, or the Vietnam War, or the loss of a loved one, or a bankruptcy, or cancer,
[time=1307] or anything else you can think of, and you choose disobedience.
[time=1313] You choose an ungodly, unloving, self-protective response to the pain that came into your life,
[time=1321] and you have fallen into a host of many different possibilities, sex, or gambling, or alcohol,
[time=1328] or drugs, or anger, or wife beating, or an unbiblical divorce, or a child molester, or debt beyond your wildest dreams,
[time=1335] or self-abuse, or envy, or overeating, or laziness, or quitting from obedience in any other form,
[time=1343] James is going to set the record straight this morning and give you three fundamental facts about that process in your life.
[time=1349] And here they are, number one, it is not God's fault, nor is it anybody else who God is in charge of fault.
[time=1358] It's not the circumstances he orchestrates, nor the people he orchestrates. It's not God's fault, nor any part of God's administration.
[time=1365] And it is true he is over everything, and he is omnipotent, and he is omniscient. He is in control.
[time=1371] But when you sin in response to difficult trials in your life, it is not God's fault.
[time=1377] Number two, it is, I know this sounds really harsh, it is totally your fault, completely.
[time=1387] Absolutely, unequivocally, without mitigation, completely, totally your fault.
[time=1396] Number three, any explanation or understanding of your behavior, your sin, that differs from one and two, it's not God's fault, it's totally my fault, is self-deception.
[time=1414] Any other explanation of your sin is self-deception.
[time=1421] Let's look at these three points as they flow from God's word for us this morning, point number one.
[time=1425] It is not God's fault, verse 13 again, let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God.
[time=1433] Stop right there on the word by, you see it there, tempted by God.
[time=1437] There are two words in the Greek language for the one word by in the English, it's spelled two different ways in the Greek.
[time=1443] One is, hupo, and that means direct agency.
[time=1447] I am being tempted by God, I am being tempted directly by God.
[time=1453] The other Greek word is, apo, which means indirectly.
[time=1458] I am being tempted indirectly by God.
[time=1462] Now, James, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, chose apo, indirect, and you might want to circle that and write indirect by it.
[time=1470] I am being tempted indirectly by God.
[time=1475] You see, that's what we want to do, even as believers.
[time=1478] We want to somehow look at his sovereignty, as I've noted, and his power and his wisdom and his knowledge and say,
[time=1484] "Hey, this is too much for me, I fell, you are indirectly responsible.
[time=1489] Why did you create me this way? Why did you give me these tendencies?
[time=1492] Why did you give me these parents? Why did you give me these economic circumstances?
[time=1496] Why did you make me look like this? Why didn't you give me more brains?
[time=1499] How come you gave me too much athletic talent, which led me to be pride, which led me to fall?
[time=1504] I mean, we got a zillion ways to say, "God, why did you?"
[time=1510] And the word of God is saying, God is saying, "Don't ever let yourself say when you're tempted,
[time=1516] I am being tempted, even indirectly, by God." Now, this has been a long-standing problem with the human race.
[time=1522] Genesis chapter 3, right?
[time=1524] God creates two perfect people, puts them in a perfect place called the Garden of Eden and says, "Don't do just one thing. You do anything you want to do. Just don't do one thing.
[time=1530] Don't eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil." Of course, they did.
[time=1535] I don't know how soon, but they did.
[time=1538] God comes then to the man and says, "Hey, Adam, with this question, are you responsible?"
[time=1547] He said it this way, "Why did you do that?" Which implies responsibility. Here it is, quote, from the first man who ever lived, "The woman that thou gave us to be with me, she gave me from the tree and I ate."
[time=1564] You see what he's saying here?
[time=1565] He's not really blaming the woman.
[time=1567] He's secondarily, he is.
[time=1568] He is blaming.
[time=1569] It is the woman that thou gave us to me.
[time=1574] This is what he's saying, "Hey, God, you know what happened?
[time=1576] This one day I'm in the Garden of Eden and I go to sleep.
[time=1579] And when I go to sleep, I never even heard what a woman is.
[time=1582] I don't know what a woman is. I've never seen a woman.
[time=1585] I've never conceived of a woman.
[time=1588] I wake up the next morning, I'm married to one." Yeah, that's right.
[time=1597] I got one for a wife now.
[time=1599] And I didn't pick her.
[time=1601] And you didn't give me a bunch of them from which I could choose?
[time=1604] It wasn't my idea to create a woman.
[time=1607] Why would you create a woman with the capacity to reach from the tree and say, "Here, try this." God, what do you mean to my response able?
[time=1617] Of course I'm not response able.
[time=1620] You're responsible for my sin.
[time=1628] So God goes to the next person on earth, the woman.
[time=1631] And he says to her, "Eve, are you response able?
[time=1635] Are you able to accept responsibility for your behavior?" And she says, this is really good.
[time=1640] This, by the way, is better than him.
[time=1642] Ladies, just be encouraged.
[time=1643] This is much sharper, much more insightful.
[time=1646] She says, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate." She does two things.
[time=1652] She does what Adam does, the serpent, where did the serpent come from?
[time=1655] God, why did you create a serpent and then let him in the garden?
[time=1660] And we know who was in the serpent, don't we?
[time=1663] Now, she might not have known that.
[time=1665] But we know that this guy named Lucifer was in the serpent.
[time=1669] Well, who was he?
[time=1670] He was somebody that God created before he even created Adam and Eve, called the highest angel of all the angels, who fell and sin and became Satan.
[time=1677] And so her argument could be extrapolated to this.
[time=1680] Good night, me responsible?
[time=1682] You created the animal, this thing called a serpent.
[time=1685] Before that, and before I was even around, you created Satan, Lucifer, who fell and became, what?
[time=1692] You're going to pin this on me, big guy?
[time=1694] Uh-uh.
[time=1696] This is your problem.
[time=1698] You set the system up.
[time=1700] But then she gets even more clever.
[time=1702] She says, "He deceived me." Whoa, now that is a good way to shift responsibility.
[time=1707] What is she saying?
[time=1708] I was deceived.
[time=1709] Wasn't me to be deceived.
[time=1710] I don't know what I was doing.
[time=1711] I thought I was doing A, and reality I was doing B.
[time=1715] Now, you're upset because I did B, but I didn't think I was doing B.
[time=1718] I thought I was doing A.
[time=1720] Ha, so just put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[time=1722] You see what I'm saying?
[time=1724] She is just shifting responsibility for her behavior.
[time=1728] You set the system up, and besides the way you set the system up, and maybe even implied inside of that, you gave me the ability to be deceived.
[time=1736] Why did you do that?
[time=1738] Why didn't you make me un-deceivable?
[time=1740] Oh, you are not a good God.
[time=1743] You are clearly not a good God.
[time=1745] You are clearly at fault.
[time=1747] You ought to repent.
[time=1749] Ha, ha.
[time=1751] I know, it's close to blasphemy, but it's not.
[time=1756] Now it goes on, look at verse 13.
[time=1759] First phrase, let no one say, now that's in the passive.
[time=1764] Excuse me, the middle voice in the Greek, which means don't even say it to yourself, which is where all this stuff starts anyway.
[time=1770] Let no one say you could add to himself because that's the way it's written in the original language.
[time=1775] When he is tempted, that's a present tense deal.
[time=1778] So don't say to yourself when you're in the process of being tempted that this is indirectly coming from God.
[time=1784] Don't do that.
[time=1787] Why?
[time=1788] Well, he answers that in verse 13, unbelievably clear answer, because God cannot be tempted by evil,
[time=1795] and he himself does not tempt anyone.
[time=1798] You see, we're down now to the character of God, and what the Bible tells us in the Old Testament and the New Testament is that God is holy, and the holiness thing is totally separate from sin.
[time=1807] It's like oil and water, and you know as well as I know you can't mix those two things no matter what you do.
[time=1812] There are intrinsic properties in water and intrinsic properties in oil that absolutely defy their mixing.
[time=1818] That's what he's saying.
[time=1820] There is something in the nature of sin, and something in the nature of God, it is impossible for those two things to come together.
[time=1827] There is no partnership there.
[time=1829] There is no harmony.
[time=1830] There is no moving in the same direction.
[time=1833] Sin and God don't mix because of the nature of sin and the nature of God.
[time=1838] There is no capacity for evil in the nature of God.
[time=1843] There is no vulnerability or susceptibility to evil in the nature of God.
[time=1847] It's just they bounce off.
[time=1848] There's just no contact.
[time=1849] There's no connection.
[time=1850] It just doesn't happen.
[time=1852] But this is a wonderful argument that people through the years have done.
[time=1855] You see, if you can get an ultimate authority, if you can get your God to not only be tempted to evil himself, susceptible to this stuff, and committing it, and then also to use his superior position of power to tempt you, you my friend are off the hook for anything you do.
[time=1876] It's just like it happens at work.
[time=1878] And you know how it happens at work.
[time=1880] There is a chain of authority at work, you got this person reports to this person reports to this person reports to this person, and something went wrong.
[time=1887] And so the person who owns work called the boss, he comes in and he wants to figure this out.
[time=1893] And he's asking the question, who is responsible?
[time=1897] Now you don't mind when he does that and something good has gone, right?
[time=1901] And it's me.
[time=1902] It's definitely me.
[time=1904] Now I know that my supervisor may be thought of it, but I was the critical one here to occur this good thing.
[time=1909] He comes through the door looking for what went wrong, and everybody's going, "Wow, you know, I was just doing what I was told."
[time=1916] And so the guy goes, "That guy, well, I was just doing what I was told." Well, I was just doing, and we're just trying to shift the blame right up the ladder, because if we can get somebody who's more responsible, more in authority than ourselves, to be the one to blame, then we are no longer response able, just following orders.
[time=1935] Can't hold me accountable for that.
[time=1941] He says, "Don't do that. Don't do that." So that brings us to our second point. Who is responsible?
[time=1948] Well, this gets really clear and blunt.
[time=1951] Verse 14, "Each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust."
[time=1961] James is saying, "I'm going to set the record straight today, and I'm not only going to tell you who it isn't at fault, it isn't God, and it isn't any part of God's administration that is at fault.
[time=1970] It is completely and totally you.
[time=1972] You are the one who is at fault for your behavior.
[time=1975] You are culpable.
[time=1976] You are responsible.
[time=1977] But he's going to go a step further than just saying that kind of bluntly.
[time=1980] He's going to go into the inner workings of why we're responsible.
[time=1984] He's going to go past our behavior and into the inner workings of the human being to expose why the human being is responsible for his behavior.
[time=1993] Now he uses a fishing and a hunting metaphor here in verse 14, and these words carried away and enticed.
[time=2001] Now not a big fisherman, but this idea of being carried away first.
[time=2007] It is the idea that there is a fish somewhere in the safe little haven underneath some protective reeds or branches and it's out of view and it can hardly be detected and he's safe in there.
[time=2020] And this fisherman comes along and he is now going to try to, here's it, carried away, draw the fish out to a point of vulnerability.
[time=2029] The bait can't get all the way back in there, so the bait goes in here and this idea being carried away is the actual movement out of safety into a vulnerable dangerous position.
[time=2040] That's what carried away means, the movement out from safety.
[time=2043] Now the next word in your text says enticed, enticed, and that is the word for the bait and the hook thing that is there.
[time=2051] And you think you're going to get a wonderfully marvelously delicious fat juicy worm and what you get is that plus death, a hook.
[time=2062] So the word enticed is that whole system of bait and trap.
[time=2067] Now think again, look at verse 14.
[time=2070] You get carried away, you get drawn out of your safe place and you get into the bait and trap system by your own lust.
[time=2083] Now guess what, here comes the word by again, do you see it by his own lust?
[time=2086] Guess which one that is in the Greek.
[time=2089] That's hupo, which means direct agency.
[time=2093] God is not only not indirectly responsible for your sin, apo, you are directly responsible for moving out of your safety zone into the bait and trap arena.
[time=2107] And that is your strong desires that do that.
[time=2110] Now in the spiritual context, obviously, what's the safe zone for a believer?
[time=2115] What's the safe zone for a Christian?
[time=2117] Where are we protected when we are in obedience?
[time=2120] That's the safe place.
[time=2122] It doesn't mean we don't get trials, it doesn't mean we don't have bad things happen to us, but it is the safe place because we are committing our lives to the direction and the will of God, which is the only place safe for a Christian.
[time=2134] That's the safe haven.
[time=2135] He's saying you get drawn out of the safety of obedience into the vulnerable bait and trap scenario directly by your own desires.
[time=2147] No blame shifting allowed here.
[time=2153] Now let's talk about desires because we can get a little nervous on that one.
[time=2156] It can be misunderstood.
[time=2158] There are two kinds of desires.
[time=2160] There are the routine desires which God gives us, which are normal and to be enjoyed when they are satisfied.
[time=2166] And then there are what we call the runaway desires.
[time=2169] For me in the Greek the excessive lust, this absolutely compulsive, gotta have it, gotta find it, gotta get satisfied, lusting desire, runaway desires.
[time=2181] And I use compulsive not to describe reality, but only to describe what it feels like to the individual who is under the power of lust.
[time=2190] So let's talk about that.
[time=2191] Routine desire for sleep.
[time=2192] That's very good.
[time=2193] God gives it to us.
[time=2194] It's a marvelous gift that comes down from heaven.
[time=2195] And there's nothing wrong with desiring a good night's sleep.
[time=2197] There's nothing wrong with coming home late and saying, "You know what I want to do? I want to hit the hay." Turn that into a runaway desire and you're a slugger because you sleep too much.
[time=2206] Sleep has become your God.
[time=2207] Sleep is what you live for and you can't function as God would intend you.
[time=2211] Talk about clothing, nothing wrong with a normal natural desire for clothing to keep warm, to be modest, to fit into the culture in which you live for the glory of God.
[time=2222] Turn that into a runaway desire and you've got a person who's absolutely obsessed with how they look because they want to create certain impressions on other people.
[time=2230] And they're willing to go to any length.
[time=2232] It is the defining reality how people perceive me by virtue of what I have on my body.
[time=2237] Normal, unnormal.
[time=2241] Shelter, wonderful desire, a place of protection from the elements, an enclosed private area where you can conduct the affairs of your life with your family.
[time=2251] Run away desire.
[time=2253] I am absolutely consumed with the passion to have this monstrous, impressive castle of sorts because I'm thrilled with the notion that mine is bigger than somebody else's.
[time=2264] Now note, there's nothing wrong with having nice clothing and there's nothing wrong with having a nice, even a big house.
[time=2271] He's not talking about your behavior. He's talking about your desires.
[time=2276] And if you have a little house or a huge house, if you lust for a certain kind of house, he's talking to you.
[time=2281] If you have a little house or a big house and you're okay with just enjoying that as a blessing of God and it is not the divining motive of your life, you're okay.
[time=2290] So please don't confuse the issues.
[time=2294] So, he is laboring in verse 14 to say, "When you sin, it's your fault and nobody else's."
[time=2303] You're in a trial. It's hard. You're carrying baggage from your past.
[time=2308] You're anticipating more baggage in your future. It's incredibly difficult day to day.
[time=2313] And you want to give up. God says, "Get on your knees and pray for wisdom as to how you can survive, endure and conquer and be victorious through this trial."
[time=2322] If you don't and if you sin and if you disobey and if you're unloving and selfish and protective and the things that God says not to be, he says this, take full responsibility for that behavior.
[time=2333] Just stand up to the table and say, "I did it. I am the one who moved out of the protective zone of obedience.
[time=2341] I am the one who got into the trap, and I am the one who did those things because of my own intrinsic sinfulness."
[time=2352] You see, it's not enough to say, "I did it." According to James, the proper repentance is, "I did it because there's something flawed inside of me, my own sinful heart, my own demanding spirit."
[time=2369] Now verse 15, he gives you the consequence of such behavior. When lust has conceived, and he switches here from a hunting fishing metaphor to the idea of birth and impregnating, this conception is the actual word for the conception of a baby.
[time=2384] When lust has conceived, two things come together to produce an embryo. When you're lust for something and you're will to go get it, unite, you have given birth to sin.
[time=2395] Whether you've done it or not, and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.
[time=2402] Now this is a beautiful picture because I don't know how many of you had a chance to go in the birthing room there with your wife when this stuff was happening.
[time=2409] Now you're talking to a veteran, five kids, okay, I've been there and back.
[time=2413] I loved every one of them. In fact, when Randy came out, you'll find this hard to believe.
[time=2419] I was so excited and making so much noise, the nurse said, "You either calm down or you're out of the room." It was absolutely incredible. I was going to meet for the very first time my child.
[time=2429] And all of a sudden the head pops out, and then the shoulders, and then the legs, and he's just, "Oh my goodness, look!"
[time=2437] Well, we have conceived. Beautiful, gorgeous. Rest of my life. Get to spend time.
[time=2448] You see, when you're on the brink of sin, you're on the brink of disobedience.
[time=2453] You're on the brink of moving out from faithful obedience to the trial that God has brought in your life.
[time=2458] You think that your disobedience is going to conceive something beautiful, but it never does.
[time=2465] When you're lost, your runaway desire unites with your will to pursue, you conceive, not something beautiful,
[time=2472] something ugly called sin, which produces something ugly or called death.
[time=2478] You think you're on a path that leads to life when you separate yourself from the obedience to God's trial in your life,
[time=2484] but you are walking straight into the teeth of more hurt and more pain and more separation from God than you ever dreamed possible.
[time=2492] It's ugly, it's just, you just use this big horrible word called death.
[time=2503] Point three. Any other understanding of your sin is deception.
[time=2511] Any other understanding of your sin is called deception.
[time=2519] Any other possible explanation or defense or rationalization or reasoning to your behavior is deception.
[time=2529] Deception means to be led away from the truth.
[time=2533] It's called mental illness. You know what mental illness is? Believing a lie to be truth.
[time=2539] Mental illness is believing something that isn't true to be true.
[time=2544] It's mental illness. To be in safety, to be lured out, to be caught in a trap, to say then it is not my fault.
[time=2554] You can picture somebody moving out of a position of safety, literally now a human being, into this area and they get caught in a cage.
[time=2561] And they're now caught in this cage and they're saying, "It's not my fault. I'm in here. It's not my fault. I'm in here.
[time=2567] It's not my fault. I left from the safety and walked in. It's not my fault. I did this. It's deception.
[time=2573] It's mental illness. You did do it, you know, and you did it because you wanted to do it.
[time=2581] Now here's why this is so important. This is why this is so important.
[time=2586] And this is where it gets compassionate again, because this has been kind of rough.
[time=2590] And some of you folks have really struggled in your own life to get a grip on these principles.
[time=2594] And some of you have been led astray by secular psychologists who want you then to understand your past and therefore justify your present and not take responsibility for your sin.
[time=2603] And so this may sound unusually harsh to you.
[time=2606] It is, however, the truth of God's word. But now listen, let it turn its full circle here.
[time=2612] The reason it is so important that you do not continue to deceive yourself about who is really responsible for your behavior is this.
[time=2620] Because if you continue to deceive yourself, you cut yourself off from these things, repentance.
[time=2627] You can't repent for something you didn't do.
[time=2631] You cut yourself off from confession. You can't confess something that you didn't do.
[time=2638] Therefore, you cut yourself off from brokenness, true soul brokenness in the presence of God
[time=2644] and the humility that marks the point of the grace of God intersecting with your reality.
[time=2650] God gives grace to who the humble. What does God do with the proud?
[time=2657] He opposes them. You'll find that as we study our book, it's in this book.
[time=2661] He is face to face in opposition to the proud.
[time=2664] And if you think for a minute that you can justify your sin by indirectly blaming it on him
[time=2670] or directly blaming it on part of his administration and find any grace or healing, guess again.
[time=2680] You say, you must be saying these things, Russell, because you have never felt my pain.
[time=2684] You have never gone through what I have gone through, or you wouldn't interpret this passage this way.
[time=2688] Well, maybe you're right.
[time=2690] But let me tell you about the guy who wrote it, not James, the Holy Spirit.
[time=2695] Jesus Christ came to this earth and it says that he has been tempted in all points as we.
[time=2703] In other words, every possible victimization, not specifically, but the full brunt of what a sinful world can bring against the soul,
[time=2711] Christ has personally endured to its ultimate test.
[time=2716] He has stood and faced all the onslaught of temptation and trials and hardships,
[time=2722] including the possibility which became reality of being separated from the Heavenly Father with whom he was in perfect fellowship from time past.
[time=2730] A far greater trial in temptation and severe consequence than anything any human will ever experience.
[time=2737] He took it all.
[time=2739] He faced it all and then says in that passage, now watch.
[time=2743] Here's the compassion.
[time=2744] Here's why it's so important you not deceive yourself.
[time=2747] Because he says, I have been tempted in all points as you yet without sin.
[time=2753] Therefore, because you have a sympathetic high priest, draw near to the throne of grace
[time=2760] and find help and mercy in your time of need.
[time=2764] There is only one way to find help and mercy and time of need, and that is to say,
[time=2770] God, this is certainly even not indirectly your fault.
[time=2773] This sin in my life is the product of my own lust, my own wicked heart, and I confess it to you, God.
[time=2780] And I do away with any deception that would speak otherwise to me so that I can be in a position to be in your throne room and find the grace and the help in my time of need.
[time=2790] If you walk into deception, you cut yourself off from that dynamic.
[time=2796] Proverbs 28, 13.
[time=2798] This is one of those things we should buy like billboards all over Fort Wayne and put this up.
[time=2801] Proverbs 28, 13.
[time=2803] He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper.
[time=2809] But he who confesses them will find compassion.
[time=2815] You see what it does?
[time=2816] You see what Satan does to a whole culture of people?
[time=2819] Do you see how he works his incredibly deceptive network of lies?
[time=2823] He's got a whole generation of Americans saying in unanimous, chorus, it is not my fault.
[time=2831] Which means they cannot come to repentance because they have nothing to repent of.
[time=2836] And he effectively sets up an entire world system that cuts the people of our nation off from the flowing, gracious gift of salvation in Christ.
[time=2847] He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses them will find compassion.
[time=2856] 1 John 1, 8 and 9, if we say that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves.
[time=2862] Again, we are leading ourselves astray.
[time=2865] We are taking ourselves by the hand and leading ourselves into deception.
[time=2872] And the truth is not in us.
[time=2874] If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[time=2883] Do you hear those life-giving words?
[time=2886] Do you know where they begin?
[time=2887] They begin with an honest, open, response ability for your behavior.
[time=2896] Now, just quickly to wrap the passage up, look at verses 17 and 18.
[time=2899] He goes back now to the first point, which is God is not a fault.
[time=2903] Not only is God not a fault, God is good.
[time=2906] And everything good comes from God.
[time=2908] Verse 17, every good thing and every perfect gift is bestowed from above, coming down from the father of lights with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow.
[time=2916] In other words, he's saying not only has God never brought anything bad into your life that would tempt you to evil, where he could be tempted and you could be tempted where he could be responsible.
[time=2926] Everything he has ever brought into your life is nothing but good.
[time=2930] It is a perfect gift.
[time=2932] And it comes down and here light, father of lights, to be contrasted with the domain of darkness, which is Satan's domain.
[time=2938] And then it says about the father with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow, which means he never changes.
[time=2943] He's not moody, he doesn't vacillate, he doesn't change his mind, and then change it again the next day.
[time=2948] From before time began, and God is an eternal being, so there was never a time when he wasn't, he has always been the same.
[time=2954] He's always been good, and he's only given good.
[time=2958] And now to push the point in your life, he says in verse 18, and remember, the best thing I ever gave you was your salvation.
[time=2964] Look at verse 18.
[time=2965] In the exercise of whose will?
[time=2967] In the exercise of his will, he brought us forth by the word of truth, he beget us, he born us again, so that we might be as it were the first fruits among his creatures.
[time=2977] Oh my lance, he says, he look it, don't, don't impune me.
[time=2982] When you impune my motives and you impune my character, you separate yourself from the humble confession, which brings my grace.
[time=2987] And beyond not impugning me, remember that everything good in your life, anything you can think of in your life that you are thankful for, I gave it to you without cost,
[time=2995] not the least of which was your own salvation whereby you could be freed from the power of sin and death and damnation for all eternity.
[time=3002] I paid for that in my son, he says.
[time=3007] In conclusion, maybe just two brief applications.
[time=3011] So I can get this right down into your life, I hope.
[time=3015] Number one, take full responsibility for your sin.
[time=3020] I know that's redundant at this point, but it's got to be the first point of application.
[time=3023] It's the obvious application.
[time=3025] Take full responsibility for your sin.
[time=3028] When you sin, stop saying to the person you violated, this is why I sinned.
[time=3033] I had a really hard day and then I had this, and then I had that, and of course you know I'm dealing with a thing from my parents from ten years ago, and then I had this, and then I had this, and so I'm really sorry that I did that.
[time=3041] Just go to them and say, you know what, I sinned against you because I am a sinful human being, and I have lusts inside my heart for gratification, and I am willing at times to violate you to satisfy my own desires.
[time=3054] Whew, there's a confession.
[time=3058] Try that on for size.
[time=3060] That's what the Bible calls confession.
[time=3062] That's what the Bible says, taking a response, ableness for your actions, which by the way is a great privilege.
[time=3069] We're going to celebrate tomorrow, D-Day, greatest invasion of forces into any one particular landmass in the history of the world, at least at that time.
[time=3079] Eisenhower, the great supreme commander of those allied forces, had two messages on D-Day.
[time=3087] One, he broadcasted, the other he kept in his wallet.
[time=3092] The first message he said, soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the allied expeditionary forces, that's everybody.
[time=3101] Soldiers, sailors, and airmen of the allied expeditionary forces, you are about to embark upon the greatest crusade which we have striven these many months, and then he goes on to inspire his troops to great valor into victory.
[time=3116] Message number two, the one he kept in his wallet, reads this way.
[time=3123] My decision to attack at this time and place was based upon the best information available.
[time=3131] If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.
[time=3140] Now that's something else. Here you got a guy, coordinating armies and commanders and military leaders and national leaders from the entire allied forces.
[time=3149] And he can't control those guys, much less the weather and everything else that goes into fighting a battle.
[time=3155] But he knew that he was the supreme commander of the allied forces, and it indeed was his decision to attack on that day and in that way.
[time=3165] And so you're not going to find this man blaming somebody else for its failure.
[time=3169] He already, before the event occurs, writes out his full response ableness to his choices.
[time=3176] I like that. That's called maturity. Even in an unbeliever, I don't know his spiritual status.
[time=3183] Listen, an immature person always has somebody else to blame.
[time=3187] Have you noticed? An immature person always has a reason for their choices.
[time=3193] There's always a mitigating something in the mouth of an immature person.
[time=3199] In the mouth of a mature person, there is always full assumption of responsibility for choices made.
[time=3208] It's just a flat-out market maturity. Be mature. Grow up. Stand strong. Take full responsibility for your choices.
[time=3217] Number two, just quickly. Have you noticed that all bait does not work for all fish?
[time=3225] Have you noticed that you don't fish for a shark in the Pacific Ocean with the same thing you fish for a blue gill in a lake upstream here?
[time=3233] Different fish require different bait because they have different appetites and capacities. Same thing with people.
[time=3240] Satan has been fishing longer than any of us have been alive.
[time=3244] And he has made a study of humanity. And he has made a study of you.
[time=3249] And he knows exactly what shape, style, size, and taste you like your bait.
[time=3256] He knows what best maneuvers you by your own lust out of your place of safety into his trap. He knows you.
[time=3264] He knows you maybe better than you know you.
[time=3268] Now my application in this point is this. Would you please acknowledge to yourself and study your cell phone enough that you could come up with the top three baits that draw you into disobedience?
[time=3280] You ought to be able to rattle those things off. One, two, three. These are my vulnerable spots. These are my weaknesses. This is my character flaws.
[time=3286] Here I am at my point of greatest temptation. This is what I am.
[time=3290] And then communicate that to some people who love you and say would you mind looking over from your safe spot to my safe spot and when you see me start to do a little bit of this action after one of those three things no matter what I am saying to you?
[time=3302] No matter how I am justifying it. No matter how I am explaining it. Would you just grab ahold of me and say would you come here for a minute?
[time=3308] Would you remember the three things that we talked about? Would you go back there into safety please? And stay obedient.
[time=3315] We need help. We need that kind of help.
[time=3320] Take full responsibility for your sin and as fast as you can find faithful friends who know your areas of temptation who will stand with you and help you faithfully execute your responsibilities.
[time=3334] But I just feel burned in my heart to say a special word to some of you who have had traumatic pasts.
[time=3341] And I have counseled with some of you and I get a little choked up.
[time=3345] I know how hard I think I know a little bit of how hard it is to live with what you are living with.
[time=3352] And some really horrible, dastardly things have come into your life.
[time=3358] And there is a temptation to justify your continued weakness on those failures that is almost all-consuming, especially in our day and age.
[time=3369] And I can't say it's strong enough to you. God sympathizes with your hurt and your pain and he understands it, but it does not provide a base for your disobedience.
[time=3378] And until you can confess full responsibility for your behavior, you are cutting yourself off to one degree or another from the grace of God to help you one through it.
[time=3391] Well we've come to the close of another Bible Hour presentation. I hope it was a blessing to you. And I take a moment please at the close here and just remind you of a couple programs that will be coming up in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
