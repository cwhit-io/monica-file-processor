[time=0] Maybe it's because of you that God has laid this message on my heart in a most unusual
[time=6] way.
[time=7] Maybe you have been coming to Blackhawk for a number of days, maybe months, maybe a year or so, maybe many years.
[time=14] And you have been warming up to the knowledge of God and to the thought of coming to Christ.
[time=20] But this morning, I want you to know that the Spirit of God is doing something unique in my heart and it may be for you.
[time=27] It may be for you.
[time=28] It may be because this is the morning that God wants to clearly articulate to you the gospel in such a way that you can come to Christ.
[time=47] Welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=49] An hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=55] Thank you for joining us.
[time=57] Today on the Bible Hour, Pastor Moore presents a very clear understanding of what it means to be saved.
[time=63] Many of you in our viewing audience may have been thinking about making this significant decision to come to Christ for a number of months, maybe even years.
[time=71] Today may be the day.
[time=74] We encourage you to reserve the next few minutes to listen very carefully to what God's word has to say about what it means to become a Christian and consider carefully whether or
[time=84] not this isn't the decision you should make today.
[time=87] Our special music will be presented by Read the Favor and by the Ladies Trio.
[time=99] Please join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=124] God, our God, our Him, our Lord, our Him, our Father, our Son, our Holy God.
[time=143] God, our great Creator, we gave a Savior, and all our soulness, well than we need.
[time=163] God, from His glory, our living glory, our God and Savior gain, and Jesus was His name.
[time=182] And in our nature, to His own as stranger, our better sorrows, tears and hate, the need.
[time=199] But God, the Savior, bringing us revenge on, and in the dead mind, and one day focused
[time=215] on you, and in the dead mind, and in the dead mind, and in the dead mind, and in the dead
[time=293] mind, and in the dead mind, and in the dead mind.
[time=317] Thank you for joining us this morning, we'll return to the service in just a moment.
[time=322] But first I want to tell you about a very special gift we're offering for the first time here on the Bible Hour for all our fathers.
[time=330] It's a beautiful hardbound book titled, "A Father's Gift, The Legacy of Memories."
[time=336] This heartwarming book written by Ken Geier is our way of saying thanks to all our fathers for the love, hard work, and dedication they give to their families every day.
[time=347] A father's gift takes a nostalgic stroll back through the author's childhood as he reflects on the many memories of growing up with his father.
[time=355] A father's gift is written in lyrical prose and will touch the heart of any reader who remembers just how really important fathers are.
[time=364] No doubt pictures of your own father will come to mind as you leaf through the pages, each one painting a different picture and reminding you at the same time of the unseen guiding hand of our Heavenly Father.
[time=376] The Bible Hour is offering this beautiful Father's Day gift free to all who write and request it.
[time=381] To receive a father's gift, "The Legacy of Memories," please write to the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=392] That's the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=397] Write to us this week, won't you?
[time=399] Now let's return to our service.
[time=402] Now my life is beautiful, praise comes easy to me.
[time=419] And I failed when all was darkness, for the truth was so hard to see.
[time=433] Thank you for the trials, if it will bring me close to you and help me, Lord, to smile
[time=443] when things don't go the way I want them to.
[time=448] If I suffer pain, help me that I don't complain, but thank you, Lord, and praise you just the
[time=459] same.
[time=460] I want to thank you, Lord, and praise you just the same.
[time=470] Now help me to remember that even you were made to cry, yes, the Son of God, our Redeemer,
[time=482] you knew you were not too reason why.
[time=487] If I feel like dying, help me that I don't stop trying, but pray to you, thank you just
[time=496] the same.
[time=500] I want to thank you, Lord, and praise you just the same.
[time=512] And when I think of you upon that tree, I know that what you did, you did there for
[time=524] me, and so until my days on this earth are finally through, wherever you will lead, God,
[time=537] oh you, my Jesus, oh sweet Jesus, now if I suffer pain, God, help me that I don't
[time=561] understand, but thank you, Lord, and praise you just the same.
[time=584] Praise your holy name, I want to praise you, God, I will praise your holy name.
[time=610] Well thank you for watching the Bible Hour today.
[time=621] For a number of weeks we've been offering the Book of Father's Gift, a legacy of memories to any of you that would write to us and tell us that you're watching the Bible Hour.

[time=641] Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=646] This book is just a short book really about memories that a father has concerning his children.
[time=652] It'll inspire you and it'll remind you of some of the great memories that you might have with your own children.
[time=657] Well I'm very thankful today that I'm in an air condition building because we're experiencing
[time=663] a heat wave in Indiana.
[time=665] I think the temperature is supposed to get up to about 96 degrees today.
[time=670] So if you're watching in Fort Wayne and you'd like to have a cool evening inside a building, why don't you come to the Black Hawk Baptist Church tonight and see the concert by Steve and Maria Gardner.
[time=681] They've just recently released a new album entitled The Eye of the Storm.
[time=685] They'll be presenting all of that new music as well as many of the songs that they've sung here at Black Hawk Baptist Church in an area of churches and songs that we've heard
[time=696] on local Christian radio stations.
[time=698] So if you're in the Fort Wayne area, there's still time to come.
[time=701] It's 6 p.m. tonight at the Black Hawk Baptist Church here in Fort Wayne.

[time=710] Come and join with us at 6 o'clock tonight.
[time=713] Then I want to remind you that we're having our annual patriotic panorama on Sunday, July 3rd.

[time=725] those that have served in our Armed Forces, and we'll also be having a special salute to the Farmers of America.
[time=732] So come and join us for that great event on July 3rd.
[time=749] How rich I am since Jesus came my way.
[time=765] Re-deep my soul and turn my night to day, how very rich, how very rich I am.
[time=779] Such peace and joy I never knew before and countless blessings from His boundless store,
[time=795] how very rich, how very rich I am.
[time=805] There's a greater glory in a sunset, a brighter twinkle in a star.
[time=822] There's much more promise in a rainbow, more music in a singing bird.
[time=834] I'm far, all things have changed, my eyes once blind and see.
[time=846] No whole wide world is now a symphony, and with all this, how is my destiny?
[time=862] How rich I am.
[time=871] [APPLAUSE]
[time=878] To the Andrews Sisters for that wonderful number, and come back next week with the boogie,
[time=891] bugle boy.
[time=893] That's good.
[time=895] We're so blessed to have a music ministry here that showers us with that kind of quality
[time=901] singing each and every week.
[time=903] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come to Ecclesiastes, Ecclesiastes
[time=909] chapter 3 verse 11.
[time=913] If you don't know your Bible very well, kind of fall open to Psalms right in the middle, and then turn right, and go to Proverbs, and then you'll eventually come to the book
[time=924] of Ecclesiastes.
[time=925] There's a verse in Ecclesiastes 3 that I think will get us started this morning in
[time=931] our thinking.
[time=941] Ecclesiastes 3 verse 11 says, "He," meaning God, "God has made
[time=948] everything appropriate in its time.
[time=952] He has also set eternity in their heart." That's why I want you to stop for a minute.
[time=960] This verse is telling us that God has set eternity in our hearts, an eternal perspective,
[time=968] a sense that there is more going on in life than what happens when we're here on earth,
[time=976] in our 70 years if we get to live that long, that after we die, there is eternity.
[time=983] After we are physically dead, the human goes on forever.
[time=987] It is an eternal orientation in the heart of every man, every woman, every boy, every
[time=993] child.
[time=995] God has set this eternal orientation in the hearts of people all over the world.
[time=1001] And it should not be difficult for us to understand this or to accept this notion because God is so capable of placing things like this in the heart of man, even in the animal kingdom.
[time=1013] Think with me just as an example about the birds who migrate.
[time=1018] God has given them an inward orientation that when the weather starts to get cold, they migrate.
[time=1026] They not only know when and they know where, but they know how to get out of that particular
[time=1032] location and go somewhere else where it's warm and then when times change, they come back.
[time=1037] In Indiana, we have a lot of geese, Canadian geese, messy things that they are, but they're
[time=1043] everywhere around here.
[time=1045] And they have this interesting thing about them.
[time=1048] Not only do they know when and where to migrate, they know how.
[time=1052] I came across some information just fascinating about the ability of these geese to migrate.
[time=1057] Did you know, as you notice, they fly in these marvelous formations, these wing-V-type formations.
[time=1064] And that is not by chance.
[time=1067] That is because God has put in them this something that wants them to migrate and in particular in a certain way.
[time=1075] The Lord has designed the wing of a geese with kind of a bow to it.
[time=1079] And so that when they do their work, they create an air lift immediately behind them.
[time=1086] Which means then that the geese who are in line as they line up in this great V, the ones that are really working hard are the first couple three up there in the front of the point.
[time=1094] The rest of them are in what you call a draft situation being caught up by the air foils coming off the wings of the geese in front of them, which means they work far less as they fly this particular distance.
[time=1105] In fact, the scientists who study them tell us that because of that V formation, the geese has extended its flying range by 75%.
[time=1116] If one geese tried to fly, he could not go as far, 75% shorter as all these geese moving
[time=1123] in line because of the way their wings work.
[time=1127] Now obviously, as you might suspect, the lead geese get tired.
[time=1132] And so when they do, they just peel out of formation, other geese step into line.
[time=1136] Those other geese have been resting, so to speak, on the air foils of those in front of them.
[time=1141] The lead geese back up and get into a safe protective place of rest in this great V.
[time=1147] They just do this instinctively.
[time=1149] Why?
[time=1150] Because God has put it in their heart to do that.
[time=1154] Furthermore, when you hear them going overhead and you look up and you hope they don't drop their bombs all over your walkway or your yard or your pool or whatever you're doing, your picnic, you'll notice that they're honking at each other.
[time=1167] But if you knew a little more about it, you'd recognize that the lead geese don't honk.
[time=1172] The only ones doing the honking are the ones in the rear, and scientists are suggesting that that is some type of encouragement from the rear to the front to keep up all that hard work out there.
[time=1183] It's amazing the way this works.
[time=1186] Furthermore, when any geese in this formation becomes ill, is sick, or is wounded by a hunter,
[time=1195] but isn't fully fatally wounded.
[time=1198] And one of these geese has to break away from the formation instinctively and consistently,
[time=1204] this is true of all geese everywhere, two of them go with the sick one.
[time=1209] So three of them bail out of the formation and land somewhere, and those two stay with that wounded goose until one of two things happen, the one either dies or recovers.
[time=1222] When it recovers or fails to recover, they then wait for another group going by and join
[time=1228] in with that whole process.
[time=1231] God is capable of putting things in the heart of animals, and He's capable of putting things in the heart of men, and this verse is telling us that God has set in our hearts a sense
[time=1242] that life doesn't stop at the grave, that in fact man was created to live forever.
[time=1248] There is something that goes past the grave.
[time=1253] Now some people want to suppress that notion.
[time=1257] Some people want to deny that notion.
[time=1259] Some people want to run away from it, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist.
[time=1263] You sense that part of eternity in your heart, I sense it in my heart.
[time=1268] You know it's there, I know it's there, even though we can't see it.
[time=1272] Even though we can't empirically prove it, it's like a little boy up on a mountaintop flying a kite and a little boy's blind, and a passerby comes and says, "Little boy, what are you
[time=1283] doing?" And he says, "Oh, I'm flying a kite." And the passerby says, "But you're blind, how do you know that you're flying a kite?" And the little boy says, "It's simple.
[time=1290] I can feel the tug of the string in my hand.
[time=1295] God has placed in our hearts the tug of eternity.
[time=1298] There is something within us, and it comes from God that continually calls us to prepare and to think about and to wonder about what happens after life.
[time=1308] And this morning I want to introduce you to three individuals from the biblical record who have come to the place that they are ready to deal with that sense of eternity in their heart.
[time=1319] And they turn to a man named Jesus to find their answers.
[time=1324] We'll look at three of them this morning.
[time=1326] And first, we'll call him the man who has everything, the man who has everything because the Bible tells us that he's rich.
[time=1334] He owns much property.
[time=1336] And so, yet owning all this stuff, he still has questions about eternity, and so he comes to Christ.
[time=1343] In our day, this would be a man with a good job, a large house, two cars that are paid
[time=1349] off, vacations anywhere in the world, an insurance policy, a trust fund for the kids, a nest
[time=1355] egg for the future, this man is rich.
[time=1358] He has everything.
[time=1360] So what then does he want with Jesus?
[time=1363] He wants to understand about eternal life.
[time=1366] The man who has it all suddenly realizes that if he doesn't have eternal life, he doesn't have enough.
[time=1372] There is something he recognizes that is beyond his grasp.
[time=1375] There's something that he's not able to purchase, some deal he's not able to cut in order to acquire eternal life.
[time=1382] He's saying to himself, "I may have it all, but if I don't have eternal life, I don't have enough." And so he comes to Christ.
[time=1389] Let's peek at the conversation.
[time=1391] Come with me to Mark, the book of Mark, chapter 10.
[time=1394] And we'll look at verses 17 to 22.
[time=1413] Mark, chapter 10, verse 17, and he was setting out on a journey, meaning Christ, was going
[time=1419] to go on a journey, and a man ran up to him and knelt before him and began asking him,
[time=1426] "Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
[time=1432] There's the question we're asking.
[time=1434] Here's a guy that has come to the place, though he is rich, and you can find out that he's rich by reading verse 22.
[time=1440] That's kind of the end of the story.
[time=1442] But these words as face fell, and he went away grieved for he was one who owned much property.
[time=1450] But he, at this point in time in his life, is recognizing that if he has everything but he doesn't have eternal life, he doesn't have enough.
[time=1454] So he comes to Christ and says, "Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" Verse 18, Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good?
[time=1463] No one is good except God alone.
[time=1466] The man had used a term for absolute good in the Greek, a term that meant not good intentions, not good in comparison to people, but just flat out good, never done anything wrong."
[time=1478] The Lord says in verse 19, "You know the commandments.
[time=1482] Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not
[time=1488] defraud, honor your father and your mother." Listen to the response of this rich man.
[time=1494] He said to him, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth." I mean, this has been the constant state of affairs in my life.
[time=1503] I've always obeyed those things.
[time=1506] And Jesus, looking at him, felt love for him, and I love that.
[time=1510] I love the compassion of Christ for the lost.
[time=1514] And said to him, "One thing you lack, go and sell all you possess and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven and come follow me." And that these words, his face fell, and he went away grieved for he was one who owned
[time=1530] much property.
[time=1532] What's going on here?
[time=1534] You've got a guy that wants to know about eternal life.
[time=1536] You've got a guy that can feel in his heart because God put it there that there's an issue beyond life itself called eternal life.
[time=1544] He doesn't know where to find his answer, so he goes with the one man at that time who had been doing miracles and wonders, and by his own confession, is good.
[time=1553] He'd never heard that Jesus had ever sinned, had ever done anything wrong.
[time=1558] So he says, "Well, this must be the source of knowledge." And he says, "How can I inherit eternal life?
[time=1564] And the Lord lists off various standards that he should have kept.
[time=1569] Don't commit adultery.
[time=1570] Don't steal.
[time=1571] Don't bear false witness.
[time=1572] Don't defraud.
[time=1573] Honor your father and your mother." And the man says, "Teacher, I have kept all these things from my youth up." What an astounding statement.
[time=1582] What an absolutely astounding statement.
[time=1584] This man who has all this money is saying from the time that I was a youth up, in other words, from the time that I was 10 or 11 or 12, where I was accountable for my decisions.
[time=1593] From the time when I became a young adult, able to be held responsible for my decisions,
[time=1599] I want you to know that I have never once murdered and you go, "Well, okay, possible.
[time=1606] I have never once committed adultery, possible.
[time=1611] I have never stolen anything." Now here it gets a little tougher, watch this.
[time=1615] I have never told a lie.
[time=1618] Do you know what he's saying?
[time=1621] In all my live long days, I have always and only told the absolute truth that I've never
[time=1627] born false witness, which includes just kind of telling half the story, a lie of omission.
[time=1633] I've never told a lie of omission.
[time=1635] I've never misled anyone.
[time=1637] I've never led them to believe something other than the absolute truth about any given situation.
[time=1643] I have never lied.
[time=1646] And you think to yourself, "Good night, the guy's lying right now." The Bible says, "Everybody's sin." The Bible says all have fallen short of the glory of God and all of us look at our own lives and could we say we have never lied?
[time=1663] It gets worse.
[time=1665] He says, "Do not defraud." The word defraud means to take advantage of another person.
[time=1670] It means this.
[time=1672] To be able to say I have never defrauded would mean that in every encounter with every human being you'd ever known since you were 10 or 11 or 12, since you're youth up, you would
[time=1682] have always acted in their best interest.
[time=1685] You would never have thought of your own best interest.
[time=1687] You would have never taken advantage of them.
[time=1689] You would have never manipulated the situation to where it worked out the way you wanted it.
[time=1693] But there's always been their concern and your interest in how they might be happiest that would have just governed your entire life.
[time=1701] Once again, you're thinking, "This guy's nuts if he thinks he's gone through his whole life and only always acted in the other person's best interest." Never a selfish motive.
[time=1712] Never a selfish act.
[time=1713] Look at the other one, honor your father and your mother.
[time=1717] Now, the word honor doesn't mean just obey.
[time=1719] It means obey in action and do it with a whole heart.
[time=1725] He's saying, "I have always not only completely obeyed the instructions my parents have given me but I've obeyed them with a happy, willing, submissive heart." He's lying.
[time=1736] He's deceived.
[time=1739] He doesn't know who he's dealing with that Jesus can see right into the very fabric of his heart.
[time=1746] He thinks he's kept all these things.
[time=1748] Well, how is Jesus going to help him understand that he hasn't?
[time=1753] That's what he does in this next thing.
[time=1754] Look at verse 21 and looking at him, "Jesus felt love for him." And that's what I mean.
[time=1759] I mean, here's this man standing there boldly lying to the face of Jesus and Jesus doesn't get mad.
[time=1764] He just loves the guy.
[time=1765] He has compassion for the guy.
[time=1767] He's sorry that the guy thinks he's that righteous when he's not.
[time=1771] He's sorry that the man is so self-deceived and so committed to presenting himself as something other than he is, that he loves him instead of being irritated about it, which might be in my response and he says to him, "One thing you lack, go and sell all you possess
[time=1789] and give to the poor and you shall have treasure in heaven.
[time=1794] Come follow me." Okay.
[time=1796] You got a problem.
[time=1797] You got a guy who's unwilling to really tell you the truth about his past.
[time=1801] But what he's saying about his past is, "I have such incredible moral virtue and character that I have kept all the law of God since I was ten." Well, if that's really true, then this next request, "sell all that you have and give
[time=1814] it away," would be nothing to a man of that virtue, to a man of that character, to a man
[time=1820] of that moral standard, to a man who has always lived for everybody else's benefit, the next step, "sell everything I have, give it to the poor," of course, no problem.
[time=1828] I could do that in a heartbeat.
[time=1830] Do you understand what Jesus is doing?
[time=1833] If you are really that good, Mr. Rich Man, if you have really never sinned against the law of God, then this one simple, insignificant, meaningless, little request to give all that
[time=1844] you have for the welfare of other people, he would just up and do it.
[time=1849] And we wouldn't think twice, what does he do?
[time=1856] Verse 22, "But at these words, his face fell, his whole countenance," oh, no, not that.
[time=1865] And he went away grieved in his heart for he was one who owned much property.
[time=1873] What is it?
[time=1874] What's his real character?
[time=1875] Hey, let me tell you what I live for.
[time=1877] I live for me.
[time=1878] I live for my possessions.
[time=1880] I live for what I own.
[time=1883] That is the God of my life.
[time=1885] And if you think I'm going to give any of it away to somebody, you got another thing coming.
[time=1892] Jesus was trying to help this man see that he had no claim to eternal life in his own right, that he couldn't earn salvation, that he couldn't deserve all that God would
[time=1904] need of him to grant him eternal life as if he'd worked for it and paid for it.
[time=1910] The best way to do it was to show him that he was really worshiping and honoring money rather than God.
[time=1916] Well, there's another man that comes to this place in his life.
[time=1920] He's curious about eternal life.
[time=1922] And this is the man for the sake of this morning.
[time=1924] We'll call the man who knows everything, not the man who has everything, but the man who knows everything.
[time=1931] Extraordinary man, very intelligent, a religious leader in his day, a member of the Sanhedrin, which was the highest order of religious thinking around.
[time=1940] He no doubt had a comprehensive world and life view.
[time=1943] He had thought deeply into the philosophical issues of life, a prolific reader no doubt,
[time=1949] theologically astute up on all the religious issues of the day.
[time=1954] You could probably bring to him any religious subject and he could respond from great volumes of thought and reading and reflection on that particular issue that you wanted to raise with him.
[time=1963] He comes to Jesus though, in the middle of the night.
[time=1966] He's got a question on his mind.
[time=1970] What about eternal life?
[time=1974] You see, he's saying, "If I don't know how to attain eternal life, then I simply don't know enough." I may have a great handle on important theological doctrines, but if I don't have a handle on this one truth, I don't have enough knowledge.
[time=1990] Let's peek in on that conversation.
[time=1992] Come to John chapter three and meet a man by the name of Nicodemus.
[time=1997] Nicodemus is this great religious leader, a huge mental giant with respect to religion,
[time=2005] but he hasn't resolved the eternal question that God set in his heart.
[time=2011] He still doesn't know about eternity yet, John chapter three verse one.
[time=2017] Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[time=2023] This man came to him by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him."
[time=2033] You remember Jesus did all kinds of miracles to prove that he was, in fact, the true and living God.
[time=2039] And part of that was the Lord's ability to know the question before it was asked.
[time=2044] And so Nicodemus doesn't even get to ask his question, Jesus just gives the answer.
[time=2047] Verse three, Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly I say to you, unless one is
[time=2053] born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God," there it is.
[time=2056] Nicodemus had come saying, "How can I know about the eternal kingdom of God?"
[time=2062] You've got to be born again, look at verse four, Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man
[time=2068] be born when he is old?
[time=2070] He cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can he?" Jesus answered, "Truly, truly I say to you, unless one is born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God, that which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the spirit is spirit." What's going on here?
[time=2088] Do you realize that Nicodemus, as this great religious leader, has been working his entire
[time=2096] life to be able to stand before God and say, "God, I deserve eternal life."
[time=2103] You owe it to me because I have kept all of these religious laws.
[time=2110] And Jesus says to him, "Hey, you've got to start over.
[time=2115] All you've done is of no effect.
[time=2117] It's meaningless.
[time=2118] You've got to be born again.
[time=2119] You've got to start from scratch." And Nicodemus, he doesn't begin to understand that.
[time=2124] What am I supposed to crawl back into my mother's womb and then come out?
[time=2128] What do you mean be born again?
[time=2131] And Jesus is saying to Nicodemus, "Nicodemus, born again is something you can't do.
[time=2136] It's something that can't be done by the flesh." Remember, that's what he said, "What's born of flesh is flesh.
[time=2141] What is born of the spirit is of the spirit.
[time=2144] It's not a matter of human effort.
[time=2146] It's not a matter of human accomplishment.
[time=2148] It's not a matter of how you live your life.
[time=2150] It's not a matter of trying to keep all the laws of God because you'll continually fall short to find the kingdom of God.
[time=2157] You must be born of God to be born again, a gift that comes from heaven.
[time=2162] It comes from a unique relationship with the person of Jesus Christ whereby your sins are forgiven forever.
[time=2169] You are washed and cleansed.
[time=2171] You are made new." It absolutely was a humbling thing for Nicodemus, a great man of superior intellect who thought that his knowledge could get him to heaven, who thought that his religious reasoning would find a way into eternal life and God said, "It has nothing to do with that, Nicodemus.
[time=2190] You must be attached to me, the person of Jesus Christ." And through that, be born again, be given a spirit start through the spirit of God.
[time=2201] Then you can have life.
[time=2203] Well, there's a third man who comes to the place in his life where he's ready to deal
[time=2209] with this eternalness that God has put in his heart.
[time=2214] We'll call this the man who has done everything.
[time=2216] It's not the man who owns everything or has everything.
[time=2219] It's not the man who knows everything.
[time=2220] It's the man who has done everything.
[time=2223] Who might that be?
[time=2226] The thief on the cross.
[time=2228] Come to Luke 23 for a minute.
[time=2231] Here's a man who has lived a selfish life.
[time=2234] He's done whatever he's wanted to do.
[time=2235] If he saw something he wanted, he took it.
[time=2238] If he saw somebody he didn't like, he killed him.
[time=2240] If he wanted to go someplace, he broke in.
[time=2242] He was a thief.
[time=2243] He was a criminal.
[time=2245] He lived a selfish life.
[time=2246] He lived his life his way.
[time=2248] He was reckless and abandoned.
[time=2250] His motto was eat, drink, and be married today for tomorrow we didn't die.
[time=2254] The problem is tomorrow was today and he was hanging on a cross ready to die.
[time=2261] The end of his life was right at hand.
[time=2266] So he ends up on a cross next to Jesus, but the man who has done everything realizes that if he hasn't prepared for eternity, he hasn't done enough.
[time=2277] There is something he should have done which he hasn't yet done and so he opens the conversation with the Lord as to how he might find his way into paradise.
[time=2287] You can pick it up in Luke 23 verse 39.
[time=2290] One of the criminals who were hanged there was hurling abuse at him saying, "Are you not the Christ?
[time=2296] Save yourself and us." That was kind of a blasphemous abuse of the person of Christ.
[time=2302] In verse 40 is the man we want to look at.
[time=2305] But the other thief answered and rebuked him saying, "Do you not even fear God since
[time=2311] you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
[time=2315] We indeed, justly, for we receive what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong." And he was saying, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom," and he said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, today you shall be in paradise with me."
[time=2334] What's going on here?
[time=2337] You got a guy who has done everything he's wanted to do.
[time=2341] Absolutely reckless, abandoned, doesn't obey the laws.
[time=2346] He's lived a selfish life, he's done it his way and he's found himself on a cross being crucified.
[time=2354] Listen to his words, "Do you not even fear God?"
[time=2361] He recognizes that the ultimate authority that has placed him on the cross isn't the Roman government who heard his trial and placed him there physically.
[time=2368] It is God, there is a God, and he does have a standard and we have violated that standard and so now we stand condemned to die.
[time=2377] Here is this great confession of personal sin and personal accountability for sin.
[time=2383] You can see it again in verse 41, "We indeed, justly, for we are receiving exactly what
[time=2389] we deserve for our deeds." We're just getting what we deserve.
[time=2394] We deserve to die.
[time=2396] We deserve to be separated from God for all eternity because of our sin.
[time=2402] That's part one of his confession, listen to part two at the end of verse 41, "But this man," meaning Christ, "has done nothing wrong." That's the greatest statement of the deity of Christ this man could make.
[time=2414] This is the true living Jesus Christ who has never sinned.
[time=2417] He doesn't deserve to die.
[time=2421] My lands don't hurl abuse at the boy, don't look across at Jesus Christ and hurl abuse at him.
[time=2426] Big, for what, forgiveness, which is what he does in verse 42, "Jesus, remember me when
[time=2433] you come into your kingdom." That's eternity.
[time=2436] Oh, Jesus, please somehow, remember me, let me in the gates of heaven.
[time=2443] Now, that's an interesting thing, isn't it?
[time=2448] He makes absolutely no promises about how he's going to live the rest of his life.
[time=2452] Of course, there's very little of it, he's on this cross, but he's not saying things like, "Oh God, if you would just give me a second chance, I'd do it differently, I'd live better, I'd work harder, I'd earn salvation, I'd be a better person."
[time=2467] He totally and completely cast himself upon the grace and the mercy of Christ by saying, "Remember me when you are in your kingdom." And that, my friends, is a saving confession.
[time=2480] That, my friends, is what exactly what God wants to hear to grant eternal life.
[time=2486] Verse 43, "And he said to him, 'Truly I say to you, today you shall be with me in paradise.'"
[time=2493] Count on it, "Today you're saved."
[time=2499] So there are these three men, and they are in this place of grappling with what are they
[time=2506] going to do with eternity.
[time=2508] Let me give you two questions to help this be relevant in your life.
[time=2512] Question number one, "Do you recognize that God has set eternity in your heart?"
[time=2521] Have you come to that place?
[time=2523] Have there been times in your life, whether it's when you're standing on a beautiful mountaintop and you're looking over the vast creation of God, or whether it's when you're alone in your room at night and you're pondering the meaning of your life?
[time=2539] Or whether it was at the funeral of a loved one and you stood there in this open casket and saw the shell of the person you used to love and you say to yourself, "Where are they?
[time=2551] Did they really stop existing?
[time=2555] Are they really off into oblivion and they don't even know anything about anything?
[time=2559] Is that really what it's about?
[time=2562] Or can you acknowledge the truth of God's word that he has in fact set eternity in your
[time=2568] heart, that you have a sense, that you have an inner knowledge, that there is something there after the grave?
[time=2578] The next question is obvious.
[time=2580] It follows the first.
[time=2582] If that's true, what are you going to do about it?
[time=2586] What have you done about it?
[time=2589] Are you prepared for that eternity?
[time=2593] Are you ready to enter into eternity?
[time=2601] One last scripture as we wrap this up, come to Acts chapter 4.
[time=2606] I want to be able to be very clear and try to help you understand that if you want to accept Christ, if you want to ensure that you know what's going to happen with all your eternity that you don't leave here confused today.
[time=2619] Many of you haven't been attending our church for a number of months, maybe even years, and you've been kind of checking us out and you've been kind of experimenting with the thought of committing your life to Christ, and maybe this is the day that God would have you do that.
[time=2634] In Acts chapter 4 verse 12, you come to the part of a message that's being preached about
[time=2642] how to get saved, and it says there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name
[time=2650] under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.
[time=2654] Let me read that again.
[time=2657] There is salvation, that's eternity with God.
[time=2661] There is no other way to be eternally at peace with God, and in His presence, except for in
[time=2670] the person of Jesus Christ, there is no other name under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved.
[time=2679] You can't be saved with Buddha, you can't be saved with Muhammad, you can't be saved with Confucius, you can't be saved by any other religious leader who has ever lived, and by the way is now dead and still in His grave.
[time=2692] Christ is the only religious leader in all of history who has risen from the dead.
[time=2698] In other words, He has conquered death.
[time=2700] It would be obvious that He would be the one we would trust for that same reality in our own life.
[time=2707] I had an interesting experience a couple of weeks ago.
[time=2713] My wife and I went down to promise keepers, down there at the Hoosier Dome, a lot of you guys went to that, had a great time.
[time=2720] Absolutely phenomenal event, 60,000 men from all over Indiana, Ohio, Michigan surrounding states.
[time=2726] They sold out.
[time=2727] I mean, absolutely every seat in the place was packed.
[time=2730] No room for anybody.
[time=2733] About four weeks before the event, it dawned on me that I didn't have a ticket.
[time=2738] So I said to my secretary, Marie Doty, I said, "Marie, I know I'm a little late on this
[time=2745] one, but is there any way you can work on getting me a ticket to the promise keepers?
[time=2748] And by the way, I'd really like to take my wife Heidi because I wanted to experience this thing.
[time=2752] She just kind of looked at me like Russell, your wife and 60,000 men.
[time=2757] I mean, come on.
[time=2758] It's an all-male event.
[time=2760] You don't have a ticket.
[time=2761] They're already sold out and you want me to find a way for your wife to go too." Kind of like, "Gee whiz.
[time=2766] Thanks for a nice, easy assignment." She disappears.
[time=2769] 15 minutes later, she comes back with this glee in her eyes.
[time=2772] She's like, "Oh, I got him.
[time=2774] I got him." She's like, "I have two tickets for you and for Heidi and you can go together, sit together.
[time=2779] There's a special place where it's a VIP ticket." Well, I didn't have any idea what that meant and I said, "Great job, Marie.
[time=2787] Thanks." And she goes out the door.
[time=2789] Well, the day before, Thursday, the day before the big event down there, the promise keepers.
[time=2793] I say to her, "You know, I haven't seen these tickets or are they supposed to come in the mail with the plan?" She says, "I don't know.
[time=2798] Let me call again." So she makes this call and she says, "No problem.
[time=2800] They'll be waiting for you.
[time=2802] Just go to gate 2A.
[time=2805] You'll get them there." And I think to myself, "Okay." 2A, so I write that in my day runner and I say, "Well, who are we getting these tickets from?
[time=2815] Is there a name?" He says, "Yeah.
[time=2817] His name is Eric Garcia." Well, I never heard him before.
[time=2820] Never met him.
[time=2821] Didn't know who he was.
[time=2822] But I write it down.
[time=2823] Eric Garcia, I throw it there.
[time=2824] I figure I'll have this when I go down there because it has my cash and my credit cards, my driver's license.
[time=2827] So if I need this information, I forget it, I'll have it.
[time=2830] Well, we go down.
[time=2832] We get stuck on I-69 because there's some construction work getting done.
[time=2835] We show up 15 minutes late.
[time=2837] It's supposed to start at 7.
[time=2838] We roll in about 7, 15.
[time=2840] And as you know, the Pacers in the Knicks game is going on a market square just across the street.
[time=2845] And so by the time we show up, you can't even buy a parking place in all of Indianapolis.
[time=2850] I mean, it's impossible.
[time=2851] We're looking everywhere.
[time=2852] We're trying to find places to like, you know, double park or cheat or do something just to get a spot.
[time=2857] We figure by the time we finally get a spot, we'll have to walk so far that it'll be over.
[time=2861] Well, we drive past the Hoosier Dome.
[time=2863] I'm going to turn left, but Heidi says, "No, no, turn right." And I say, "Yes, dear." No, just kidding.
[time=2868] And so I take your advice.
[time=2870] I turn right.
[time=2871] We come right around the corner, still in immediate proximity to the Hoosier Dome.
[time=2874] And there is this sign right on the street, "V-I-P media parking."
[time=2884] I say, "Honey, that's got to be us." That's just got to be us.
[time=2889] So we whip a quick, right-hand turn and we can barely get our car onto this driveway thing.
[time=2895] So half of us is kind of hanging out in the street and people are wanting to go by.
[time=2898] And this security guy stops us and I rolled out my window.
[time=2901] He says, "Yes." I said, "Is this VIP parking as in VIP for the Hoosier Dome promise keepers?"
[time=2908] "Yes." I said, "Well, I think I have VIP tickets." He says, "Wonderful.
[time=2912] May I see them?" I said, "Well, you see, I don't have them.
[time=2918] I'm supposed to." I was told to pick him up at Gate 2A, he says, "Uh-huh." And so I'm scrambling.
[time=2923] Now, I've got my daytime around.
[time=2924] I'm going, "What's that guy's name?
[time=2925] What's that guy's name?" "Oh." Well, they were given to us by Eric Garcia.
[time=2930] He goes, "Oh, Eric, come on in." I'm like, "Yeah, all right, we're on a roll." So we get up into this parking lot.
[time=2939] It's half empty because it's, you know, VIP parking.
[time=2941] And so we park there and we walk about 10 steps to the Hoosier Dome and there is Gate 2A and another security guy.
[time=2949] And we approach Gate 2A and he's outside these doors and he stops and he says, "Where are you going?" And I said, "Well, we were supposed to go to 2A." He says, "Well, do you have tickets?" I said, "Well, I was told to go inside the gate and get them." He said, "Now, listen, don't be even toying around here.
[time=2962] If you don't have tickets, don't go in.
[time=2964] They'll throw you out." I said, "Well, they may very well do that, but I was told by Eric Garcia to go through this gate." I said, "I'm catching on." And he says, "Oh, Eric, come on in." So we're inside now and I'm not telling you, we're inside.
[time=2981] We're not like we're, you don't see anybody milling around and stuff.
[time=2984] This is inside Gate 2A.
[time=2987] And there's this desk and there's this nice lady sitting behind it and she has in front of her like all these special VIP name tags that are pre-made and plastic coated and have
[time=2997] little clips on them.
[time=2998] And I'm like reading upside down as fast as I can just hoping that our name shows up somewhere on there.
[time=3002] She says, "Yes?" I said, "Well, it's Russell and Heidi Moore." And she goes, "Oh, yes, the Moore's." Why of course?
[time=3009] And she picks them up and there we are, pre-printed, pre-pasted, perfectly done.
[time=3015] She clips one here on me, one on Heidi and then she goes like this and a guy with a little microphone on his ear comes over and says, "Please, follow me."
[time=3025] Eric Garcia.
[time=3027] Down this back hall, up this elevator, down this other hall and we come to this doorway that says VIP media and then he says, "Well, step right this way." So we walk in and there's this great spread of food.
[time=3041] I mean, it's like a five-star hotel, banquet dinner.
[time=3044] There's perrier water and grapefruit juice and orange juice and cut pies and pastas and meats and you name it, they got it.
[time=3051] And I'm so fascinated by that stuff that I don't know where I'm going and I bump into this guy.
[time=3056] And I take a step off and I recognize him as Gary Smalley, National Conference Speaker.
[time=3061] I say, "Excuse me there, Mr. Smalley, pardon me, sir, pardon me." And so we go on by him and we're not hungry because we ate on the way down.
[time=3069] So we get kind of the avant-garde, cool little glass with ice and just a touch of grapefruit juice.
[time=3074] We just kind of pick it up.
[time=3075] We're trying to, you know, fit in, right?
[time=3076] So we go then past this big room into where we're supposed to sit and there's these three
[time=3082] tiers of enclosed seating with carpet on the floors and personalized chairs and this countertop
[time=3088] in front of us and television monitors that are beaming right into this little room, everything that's happening at Promise Keepers and through the actual opening we can see Promise Keepers and we're, "Wow, these are some seats!" So we sit down and we put our little grapefruit juice there and start looking around the room.
[time=3106] Oh, honey, that's Steve Green.
[time=3111] You know the singer?
[time=3114] And that's Joe Stoll, president of Moody Bible Institute.
[time=3119] And that's Bill Bright, president and founder of Campus Crusade for Christ.
[time=3124] And that's Stephen Curtis, honey, we're completely out of our league.
[time=3130] I say to her, whatever we do, let's not draw attention to ourselves, okay?
[time=3133] If they clap, we'll clap.
[time=3135] If they stand up, we'll stand up.
[time=3136] If they speak in tongues, we'll speak in tongues, whatever it takes, okay?
[time=3141] We don't want to be growing attention to ourselves here.
[time=3145] We're out of our league.
[time=3147] So we just, we just do what they do, man.
[time=3150] We just do what they do.
[time=3152] Absolutely fantastic time, great gospel message.
[time=3155] Guys are recommitting their life to Christ, the aisles are choked with people.
[time=3158] It's just a phenomenal event.
[time=3161] We get done and we hand our little, reluctantly our little passes the paradise back in, you know?
[time=3167] And we get back and get in the car, we're driving home and I said, "Honey, you know, that's a lot like heaven." I mean, that's a lot like Christianity and she says, "What do you mean?" And I said, "You recognize that we had nothing to do with qualifying to get in that room."
[time=3183] I mean, that was a bunch of the spiritual heavyweights of the evangelical world who were there to minister and speak and sing at this conference and we're not even in that league.
[time=3192] We had no business being there, except we knew Eric.
[time=3198] And you see, with this one little name, we go past every obstacle into the epicenter
[time=3209] of blessing.
[time=3210] I said, "You know, that's what it's like to be saved.
[time=3214] We don't deserve heaven.
[time=3216] We don't deserve the privileged place of paradise." I didn't say it quite this strongly to my wife in the car, but I said, "Do you realize that when we stand at the gates of heaven, they're going to say, 'How come you want to get in?
[time=3230] You got any reason?
[time=3232] You buy a ticket?
[time=3233] Do you deserve this?' And we're going to say, "Absolutely not." But we know Jesus Christ and the God is going to go, "Come on in."
[time=3244] And when we get in there, there's going to be this huge marriage supper of the Lamb, this great, wonderful, rapturous event where we're going to feast on the glory of God.
[time=3254] And it's going to be bigger and better than we've ever seen, and it's all going to be totally free because somebody else paid for it.
[time=3261] And they're going to let us in that room based upon this one simple name.
[time=3267] We know Jesus Christ as our Savior.
[time=3272] And then we're going to start bumping into people like Abraham and Moses and Joshua and
[time=3278] King David and the Apostle Paul, and we're going to say to ourselves, "We have absolutely
[time=3286] no business being in the place to receive the blessings of these great men of God, only
[time=3295] because we have the name of Jesus Christ."
[time=3302] And the gates of heaven open wide and all the blessings that come with it.
[time=3307] Acts 4, 12 says, "And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name
[time=3313] under heaven that has been given among men by which we must be saved, saved.
[time=3320] Not earn your way, saved, accept the gift, do what the thief did, confess your sin before
[time=3326] God, admit to him that you deserve what you're getting, death and punishment and hell, and
[time=3333] then cry out and say, "Oh Jesus, please remember me.
[time=3337] When you get to heaven, implication, so that I can get there too."
[time=3343] And Jesus graciously says, "Oh, today you will be with me in paradise."
[time=3350] It was a thrilling event to be so privileged at such an exciting time as the Promised Keepers.
[time=3358] We'll remember it, I think, for a lifetime, but it pales in significance to what is available
[time=3364] to each one of us, if we will claim the name of Jesus Christ as our personal word and Savior.
[time=3371] And if you are sensing that there is an eternity, and if you are sensing that you are not prepared for that eternity, the answer, the clear, single, simple answer from God's word is it comes to you through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3386] Let's pray together.
[time=3394] We've come to the close of another Bible Hour presentation, and Pastor Moore has just
[time=3420] reminded us that we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God.
[time=3424] The Bible also says, "There is none righteous, no not one." That includes you and me.

[time=3443] I want to ask You for forgiveness, and I ask You to become my Savior today.
[time=3448] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
