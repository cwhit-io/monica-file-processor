[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=13] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=19] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=22] Thank you for joining us.
[time=23] In Pastor Moore's absence, our special guest speaker will be Dr. Robert Neenheis.
[time=28] Dr. Neenheis is Vice President of the Fort Wayne campus of Taylor University.
[time=32] In today's message, we'll be studying the text of 1 Timothy 611 in a message he has
[time=38] entitled, "The Man of God." Our special music today will be presented by the Men's Singers and by Becky Woman.
[time=51] Let's join our sanctuary choir and orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=62] I don't know why Jesus loved me.
[time=75] I don't know why he cared.
[time=82] I don't know why he sacrificed his son.
[time=86] Oh, where would I be if Jesus didn't love me?
[time=101] Where would I be if Jesus didn't care?
[time=108] Where would I be if Jesus sacrificed his life?
[time=134] Oh, where would I be if Jesus didn't love me?
[time=584] Well, the choir just sang about freedom.
[time=586] What a privilege it is to be free in America to serve and love our God in the way we choose.
[time=592] I want to remind you again that the annual Patriotic Panorama is Sunday afternoon, July 3rd at 4 p.m.
[time=598] right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=600] The doors will open about 3.15.
[time=603] It's a free of charge.
[time=605] We'll be celebrating and saluting those that have served in the Armed Forces.
[time=610] It'll be a very exciting day.
[time=612] I hope you'll come and join with us on July 3rd at 4 o'clock.
[time=616] [MUSIC - 192 seconds]
[time=813] - Thank you, Becky.
[time=834] Often in the song, it's difficult to get all the phrases, and there were some really great phrases in her song.
[time=841] The one that caught my eye in my ear the first time was being so in love you can hardly eat.
[time=847] How many of you can remember that time in your life?
[time=850] I'm sure for most of you it was just a couple days ago.
[time=852] Heartaches are often blessings in disguise.
[time=859] Memories are made along the way, and simple truth and love will keep you going.
[time=865] Fathers, we're thankful for you today, and we're extremely grateful for those of you that are rearing your children in the fear and admonition of the Lord.
[time=873] We thank all the fathers who have been working so faithfully in our churches, deacons and elders and Sunday school teachers and ushers and ministry team leaders.
[time=883] We're grateful, and we realize that all of us may not get these great flashes of greatness, but we will work along the way, day by day, to accumulate a legacy of memories that we will be thankful for in years to come because we honored the Lord.
[time=900] We're certainly glad you're here.
[time=902] A number of months ago we introduced Dr. Robert Neenheis for the first time.
[time=907] He spoke to us at a magnificent job in preaching the word that Sunday.
[time=911] He is the vice president of Taylor University in Fort Wayne, and he's now spent nearly a year here in the area, and we're certainly glad that he's here.
[time=919] We're glad that his family has become more acclimated to the city, and we've gotten to know them a little better, and we're just thankful for the ministry that he has at Taylor University.
[time=928] We're also thankful that he's so close to our area that we can have him come and speak to us from time to time.
[time=934] I would like to have you give him a Blackhawk welcome as Dr. Robert Neenheis comes to speak to us.
[time=948] Thank you.
[time=950] And thank you too for your good hospitality last Sunday to the Russian guests who have been a part of our campus for the past couple of weeks.
[time=960] As most of you are probably aware, Taylor University Fort Wayne has hosted 30 Russian educators and masters of business administration students from a university in Nishini Novgorod, Russia.
[time=973] They have been here to learn of our economy, the free market system, and along the way we trust to learn a little about Jesus as well.
[time=982] They were a part of this service last Sunday morning.
[time=985] You greeted them so warmly.
[time=987] Many of you invited some of them to your homes.
[time=990] We had far more people offer homes than we had Russian students to accommodate all of that, and thank you for the hospitality you showed to them.
[time=998] You may be interested to know that a couple of the Russian guests are believers.
[time=1004] Several of them are good church attenders, like we have good church attenders in the United States, so they have good church attenders in Russia.
[time=1012] Church is a little different in Russia.
[time=1014] If you attend the Russian Orthodox Church, they don't have pews.
[time=1017] They don't have seats to sit in.
[time=1019] You'll stand for two and a half or so hours during the service.
[time=1023] And some of them were saying afterwards, having been in this service and hearing Pastor Moore's message, that it was different from the message they normally hear in their churches.
[time=1033] That churches there tend to emphasize what you have to do and what God requires of you.
[time=1042] But last Sunday, they heard about what God gives us and what God has done for us.
[time=1048] And that was very different.
[time=1050] And so we pray, and I invite you to pray with us, that God will take the seed of His Word and bring it to fruit in the lives of those who are part of the service last week.
[time=1060] These are exciting days for us at Taylor University, Fort Wayne.
[time=1064] We're anticipating a new incoming group of freshmen to take part in the educational opportunities of our campus this fall.
[time=1072] We already have more freshmen coming now than we had last fall when we started classes, and we expect that that will continue to increase.
[time=1080] For those of you that have children, or perhaps some of you that didn't get into Harvard like you had expected, and care therefore aren't quite sure what to do this fall, we do have a couple of openings left in our freshman class.
[time=1093] And out in the foyer, there's material available to you for information.
[time=1098] There are a couple of green folders that actually contain application forms and so on.
[time=1103] But we have information there should you desire more information about the kinds of courses and programs that are offered at Taylor Fort Wayne.
[time=1110] There's also some magazines out there, the Fort Wayne Alumnus, which is kind of our informational magazine and goes out three times a year, to people who are interested in what's happening on our campus.
[time=1121] There are some copies there which are welcome to take, and if you would like to be put on that mailing list, there's a sign up sheet for that as well.
[time=1128] And of course, if you have other questions about the school, I will be around to try to answer those for you as well.
[time=1134] But I'm really here to talk about the word of God and to share that word with you, and I'm grateful for that opportunity.
[time=1142] I used to think I knew what it meant to really be a man.
[time=1146] I mean I grew up in those halcyon days of television when James R. Ness walked the streets of Dodge City as Marshall Matt Dillon, Chester not far behind, Mr. Dillon!
[time=1160] And everything always turned out right because Marshall Dillon was in town, and he was in control.
[time=1168] And I used to watch Sergeant Preston of the Northwest Monet Police and his faithful dog King.
[time=1175] And he always got his man, and his uniform never got messed up.
[time=1181] And I used to watch Perry Mason.
[time=1185] They said it was Raymond Burr, but I knew it was really Perry Mason who was doing that live.
[time=1191] Because Perry Mason was always winning, and Hamilton Burger was always losing.
[time=1197] And I could never understand how Saturday after Saturday after Saturday, Hamilton Burger could be going to the court room and lose and keep coming back for more.
[time=1208] But with men like Matt Dillon and Sergeant Preston, Perry Mason,
[time=1214] I knew what it meant to be a man.
[time=1217] And all of that ended about ten years ago when a new book was published
[time=1223] and it totally revamped my thinking about what it meant to be a man.
[time=1227] Perhaps you read the book, Real Men Don't Eat Keish.
[time=1231] And I suddenly realized that all that I had learned growing up about what it meant to be a man was not really true.
[time=1240] At Real Men Don't Eat Keish, or finger sandwiches, or liver pate, Real Men Eat Beef, not fish, not chicken, they eat beef.
[time=1251] Cooked rare, just warm mine a little on both sides.
[time=1255] I like it to moo when I stick the fork in it.
[time=1258] That's what Real Men eat.
[time=1261] Real Men don't settle arguments with discussion and compromise and some kind of sit-down session.
[time=1269] Real Men settle arguments with flamethrowers and hand grenades.
[time=1272] That's how you really settle an argument.
[time=1275] And I began to wonder now, how do I know to be a real man?
[time=1279] And then I realized that book told me everything I needed to know.
[time=1283] If I wanted to break, if I wanted to know how to walk like a man and talk like a man and dress like a man and act like a man, well, that book told me how to do it.
[time=1295] And what about a man of God?
[time=1298] What if you want to be a man of God?
[time=1301] How do you be one of those?
[time=1303] Where do you go for help?
[time=1305] Somebody says, well, I remember reading in the Old Testament someplace.
[time=1308] That's what somebody always says.
[time=1310] I remember reading someplace that some of these big guys in the Old Testament were men of God, and they were.
[time=1319] Some of the most prominent characters in the Old Testament, I referred to as men of God, people like Moses and Samuel and David.
[time=1331] And so people say, no, I can't really be a man of God.
[time=1333] If that's the quality, the criteria for being a man of God, but I want you to be encouraged today because there are also a couple of unknowns in the Old Testament that are also referred to as men of God, men like Shemaiah and Agdaliah.
[time=1350] Probably haven't read about those fellows in your devotions lately, but they're referred to as men of God.
[time=1357] Sometimes when we read in the Old Testament, we think that the man of God is someone who does great and marvelous miracles.
[time=1364] Kind of the extraordinary person, and it's true, in a sense.
[time=1371] It was said of Elijah after he raised the widow's son from the dead in 1 Kings 17, that he was truly a man of God.
[time=1380] But if the requirement for being a man of God is that you raise someone from the dead, we're probably in trouble.
[time=1387] I don't expect to, and I'm content with that.
[time=1393] But still, this man of God.
[time=1395] But then I'm encouraged, as I read elsewhere in Scripture, that there are some unnamed people who did nothing spectacular who are still referred to as men of God.
[time=1404] In fact, there are a couple of places in Scripture that simply talks about the man of God is buried over there.
[time=1412] Therefore, a man of God, I believe, is a term of reference and can be used to describe any man who is totally committed to God and to the accomplishing of his purposes.
[time=1426] Any man, totally committed to God and to accomplishing his purposes, can be a man of God.
[time=1435] Now, this is Father's Day.
[time=1436] I'm sure that's not a shock to some of you, but if you are a child and you forgot that today is Father's Day, you're in trouble.
[time=1445] On this Father's Day, I simply want to challenge the men who are listening to me, to be a man of God.
[time=1451] As important as it is that you be great fathers and great husbands and great employers and great employees and great citizens, I want to challenge you to be men of God because everything else will fall into place under that.
[time=1468] I want you to be men of God, to join me in the quest to be men of God
[time=1475] and to help us in our being.
[time=1478] There's some scriptural counsel.
[time=1481] The passage I'd like us to look at this morning is 1 Timothy 6 verse 11.
[time=1487] 1 Timothy 6 verse 11.
[time=1489] Here we find two commands given to the man of God that I believe are critical and essential if we are to fulfill that calling to truly be men of God.
[time=1503] 1 Timothy 6 verse 11.
[time=1509] "But flee from these things, you men of God, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness."
[time=1525] Men, if we're to be men of God, we need to understand these two commands.
[time=1530] The first one is to flee that which hinders you from being a man of God, to flee it.
[time=1537] In the Greek, the word which is translated to flee is a present imperative.
[time=1541] That means two things.
[time=1542] One, it's a command.
[time=1545] It's an imperative command, it's something you have to do.
[time=1549] On the other hand, it's a present tense, which means it's an ongoing action, so we might translate it this way.
[time=1555] Keep on running away from these things.
[time=1559] This is not the flight of cowardice.
[time=1563] When I was growing up in our home, we had a basement, like a lot of homes had basements.
[time=1569] It was a concrete block basement, and I hated going in the basement.
[time=1574] It wasn't finished, it was kind of damp and murky down there, and I was convinced that there were spiders the size of my hand and that someone actually lived down there.
[time=1585] Not a part of our family, just someone lived down there.
[time=1588] On those rare occasions when I actually had to go into the dungeon,
[time=1594] the only thing I wanted to do was get out of it.
[time=1597] I would do what I had to do, and then I would run up the stairs.
[time=1600] You ever have one of those flights of cowardice when you know there is someone right behind you, and you can feel them just behind you?
[time=1610] It's a frightening experience.
[time=1612] Every time I came up the stairs from the basement as a small child, the guy was right behind me, and I'm just kind of trucking right on out of there.
[time=1618] That's the flight of cowardice.
[time=1620] That's not the kind of flight we're talking about here where we say, "Flee from these things." This is the flight to safety and to security.
[time=1630] It's the flight that takes us out of danger into a place where we are secure.
[time=1636] Quite different from the flight of cowardice.
[time=1639] "Flee, keep on running from these things," the text says, and then the logical question is of course, "What things?" "What do I keep on running from?" And for that we go back just a little bit in our passage, and we read here that in verses 3 through 10 there are a couple of things we should keep on running away from.
[time=1658] I'm only going to spend a few moments looking at these because I really want to get at the things that we are to pursue.
[time=1664] The things we're to keep after.
[time=1666] But keep on running away from two things.
[time=1668] One is false teachers, verses 3 through 5.
[time=1672] False teachers are described here as those who do not agree with the word.
[time=1676] They teach things that are out of sync with Scripture.
[time=1680] We as believers today are to be like the Bereans of Acts chapter 17, who as they heard the Apostles preach kept on examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were so.
[time=1690] Don't be like the sponge who just sits back and says, "Well, that's an interesting message.
[time=1693] I guess it must be true because he stood up from the front and said it." Now there are false teachers.
[time=1700] And they're on television and on radio and in the pulpits of our churches.
[time=1703] And we need to be examining the Scripture to make sure what is being taught is consistent with the truth of the revealed Word of God.
[time=1711] False teachers don't agree with the Word.
[time=1715] And neither do false teachers preach conformity to godliness or conformity to the image of Christ.
[time=1720] Oftentimes false preachers and false teachers call conformity to oneself.
[time=1724] They'd be like me.
[time=1726] If you be just like me, you'll be wonderful.
[time=1731] Well, don't be like me, please.
[time=1735] Be like Christ. Romans 8, 29 says we are to be conformed to His image.
[time=1741] Not to another man, but to His image.
[time=1745] That's one thing we need to keep on running away from.
[time=1747] We need to keep on running away from false teachers if we're to be men of God.
[time=1750] Also, we have to keep on running away from the desire for wealth above all else.
[time=1754] Verses 6 through 10.
[time=1759] If our greatest goal in life is to amass as much money as we can, our priorities are out of line.
[time=1766] That's why I believe this Scripture says don't give yourself to the collection of great sums of money.
[time=1772] Don't desire wealth.
[time=1774] It can easily lead to compromises.
[time=1777] If all you want to do is get more money, you may well compromise your way to more money and sacrifice your testimony and your integrity, and the price is just too great.
[time=1787] If all you want to do is get more money, it may lead you to arrogance and your ability to achieve your goals.
[time=1795] If your desire is for nothing else than wealth, I fear that it may then lead to a disregard for spiritual things.
[time=1805] And so the Scripture says to us, keep on running from these things.
[time=1810] Keep on running from false teachers and false teaching.
[time=1813] Keep on running for a desire for wealth above all else.
[time=1818] Run from them as if your life depends on it, because it does.
[time=1826] Then if we're to run from that, is there anything to pursue, and there is?
[time=1832] That's what the rest of the verse is about.
[time=1834] Pursue that which characterizes you as a man of God.
[time=1839] And six qualities are enumerated for us, each of which deserves a little understanding.
[time=1846] Recognize that pursue like flee is a present imperative.
[time=1850] Again, it's a command.
[time=1852] So as you flee from those things, begin pursuing, keep on running after these things.
[time=1859] In fact, it may be translated this way.
[time=1862] Keep on pressing on with the hope of overtaking these qualities.
[time=1869] When I was in high school, I belonged to the explorer post of our Boy Scouts troop.
[time=1875] Boy Scouts go through about 13, 14, and then the explorers take over.
[time=1879] And our explorer post was a very active post in only one regard.
[time=1883] We didn't mess around much with merit badges and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1888] We had one focus in our explorer post.
[time=1891] That was winning the canoe race every spring.
[time=1895] That's what life was for us.
[time=1898] We belonged to an explorer post which was in a district that every spring sponsored this big canoe race with all the explorer posts.
[time=1906] And for 17 consecutive years, our post had won first place and second place.
[time=1913] And on those few occasions when we actually entered three canoes, we also won third place.
[time=1919] All we wanted to do was win.
[time=1921] And not only did we want to win, these were timed races every canoe leaving a minute apart.
[time=1926] And you simply needed to win the time.
[time=1929] Our goal was even more serious than that.
[time=1932] Wherever we started in the race, we wanted to be first to the finish line.
[time=1938] It wasn't enough to win by time, we also had to win by place.
[time=1943] We were crazy.
[time=1945] We built our own canoes, wood and fiberglass, gunnels just inches above the water line.
[time=1951] Other posts would come in with their aluminum canoes sitting up there like a sailboat.
[time=1955] They'd come with these little dinky paddles you buy at Kmart about this wide, you know.
[time=1959] We made our own paddles.
[time=1961] They were big blade paddles conformed to our hands.
[time=1965] In late fall, we started exercising a couple of nights a week as we got later into the winter.
[time=1971] Three, four nights a week, pull-ups, arm holds, push-ups, sit-ups, anything to win this thing.
[time=1979] As soon as the ice began to break up on the river, we were out on the river in our canoes practicing.
[time=1985] We were serious about winning.
[time=1988] One of the years that I was racing, I was in a run.
[time=1991] And we switched off through a number of transitions throughout the races.
[time=1996] And the one that we were supposed to be on was about an hour and a half long.
[time=1999] So fairly long run, some of them were shorter, forty-five, fifty minutes, some were longer, an hour and a half being about the longest.
[time=2005] But some were along the line, a miscalculation had taken place.
[time=2008] And this one actually ended up being about two hours.
[time=2010] We were in the canoe.
[time=2011] My partner and I, he and the bomb, in the stern, we were making great time in our race.
[time=2016] And as we took the canoe for our stretch, there was only one canoe about four minutes ahead of us.
[time=2022] We were winning the race.
[time=2024] There was no question about time anymore.
[time=2026] It was place.
[time=2028] And we started out ten strokes.
[time=2032] Ten pull, pull, switch, ten strokes, back and forth.
[time=2037] As we cross under bridges, people are telling us times, we're making up time, we're getting there.
[time=2042] We're going to take it, hour and a half into the race, we thought we're going to be done.
[time=2046] And they shot, "No, you've got about thirty minutes to go!" And I'm dying.
[time=2049] We're pooped.
[time=2051] We're ready to be done.
[time=2052] I'm cramped up from sitting in that canoe.
[time=2054] There's not a lot of leg room for these legs.
[time=2057] And I kind of folded them up and tucked them away and I wanted to get them out and stretch them out.
[time=2062] And what the race wasn't done.
[time=2065] We were closing in, we could see them.
[time=2067] We were within striking distance.
[time=2068] And so we pulled and we pulled and we raced.
[time=2071] We caught them and we passed them.
[time=2073] We got to the point where we transitioned to the next team.
[time=2076] And I stood up in the canoe and I fell out.
[time=2081] And my legs kind of cramped up and they carried me out of there.
[time=2086] And it hurt like mad.
[time=2088] I thought this is crazy.
[time=2090] But we got them.
[time=2093] We took them.
[time=2094] We're going to win place and time.
[time=2099] It's amazing what kids will do when they're really committed.
[time=2104] Pursue.
[time=2107] Keep on pursuing with a thought of overtaking.
[time=2112] It's the same kind of commitment that's being called for here.
[time=2115] If we're to be men of God, it doesn't happen in the casual mode.
[time=2119] It doesn't happen simply because we've given it a shot.
[time=2123] We've tried a little bit.
[time=2125] It happens because we commit ourselves to being a man of God.
[time=2129] We will let nothing stand in our way.
[time=2132] We will discipline ourselves.
[time=2133] We will exercise ourselves.
[time=2135] We will give ourselves to the calling and we will not rest even though it hurts.
[time=2142] Until we have achieved that which God has set before us.
[time=2148] Pursue righteousness.
[time=2151] Press on with the hope of overtaking.
[time=2155] Righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance and gentleness.
[time=2159] What are these?
[time=2160] Righteousness, first of all, really has to do with our relationship to one another.
[time=2165] On the one hand, it's not really necessary for us to pursue righteousness because the second Corinthians 5, 21 tells us as believers in Christ, we are righteous before God.
[time=2175] He made him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in him.
[time=2183] And before God, you and I are righteous because of faith in Jesus Christ.
[time=2186] On the other hand, the righteousness which is ours in faith must become the righteousness now demonstrated in life.
[time=2195] God didn't save us to just kind of set us on the shelf, but now he calls us to go out and be righteous in an unrighteous world.
[time=2203] Romans 6 puts it a little differently where we are called to go from being slaves of sin to now being slaves of righteousness.
[time=2210] That righteousness is our master.
[time=2213] We serve righteousness through the way that we live our lives.
[time=2220] To live a righteous life is really a pretty practical thing.
[time=2222] Let me suggest a couple of things that I think are wrapped up in living righteously.
[time=2227] How about something as simple as paying our bills in a timely fashion?
[time=2232] That's righteous living.
[time=2234] It's an obligation.
[time=2236] We have a requirement to fulfill our obligations.
[time=2239] If you want to live righteously, pay your bills in a timely fashion.
[time=2243] If you want to live righteously, work with integrity.
[time=2246] Be there when it starts.
[time=2247] Stay there until it ends.
[time=2248] Work the whole time you're there.
[time=2250] Don't take a couple of extra reams of paper because your printer at home has run dry.
[time=2255] Don't see if you can squeeze a few more moments out of your lunch hour or catch a few extra dollars in your expense report.
[time=2262] Work with integrity.
[time=2264] That's living righteously.
[time=2266] Obey the laws.
[time=2267] There's an interesting thought.
[time=2269] That's living righteously.
[time=2270] I have a colleague at the university who says, "If I'm to live righteously, I'm to obey the laws," and that includes speed laws.
[time=2280] Why do some of you already smile?
[time=2283] He says, "If the law says 65, I drive 65.
[time=2286] If the law says 35, I drive 35." I look at the speed sign and I see 65 and I fix my glasses.
[time=2295] Oh, it's 69, okay.
[time=2297] Some of you think it says 72 because I get passed as I go 69 and it's 65,
[time=2304] but he says no.
[time=2306] For me, righteous living is obeying the law.
[time=2309] 65 is 65.
[time=2313] Righteous living is demonstrating care and concern for other people even as we have been cared for by a loving God.
[time=2321] All of that is righteous living.
[time=2323] It's nothing elaborate or spectacular.
[time=2325] It simply says, "I'm going to allow the work of God in me to begin to show through me."
[time=2332] If you want to be a man of God, live righteously.
[time=2335] If you want to be a man of God, live a godly life.
[time=2341] We could actually say pursue reverence and fear of God in every part of your life.
[time=2348] Not just the Sunday morning part, which is really pretty easy.
[time=2352] But the Monday morning part, which isn't quite as easy, and Friday evening and Saturday afternoon.
[time=2361] This kind of reverence, godliness, is really an outgrowth of what God has done within us.
[time=2368] It's an expression of gratitude.
[time=2370] We acknowledge that God has done a great work even as we have sung a part in our worship this morning.
[time=2377] We acknowledge with gratitude His work and we seek to live our lives to His glory.
[time=2382] The pursuit of godliness demands that we cultivate an active sense of the presence of God in our lives,
[time=2388] not just for an hour on Sunday, but 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, that we acknowledge God's role in our lives.
[time=2398] Our dependence upon Him is right to have a word and work in our lives.
[time=2406] What does it take to do that?
[time=2407] Well, we're back to basics at that point.
[time=2410] If you want to practice the presence of God in your life, the word becomes critical, because how can you practice God's presence in your life without knowing what it is He expects of your life?
[time=2420] Prayer becomes essential because you have to cultivate a relationship with Him, and that happens through conversation and communication.
[time=2428] Active participation in worship, investment in ministry, giving yourself to the communication of the great truths of the word, all of those are a part of practicing the presence of God every day, not just one day a week,
[time=2442] and all of those enable us to live godly lives.
[time=2448] To be a man of God, you must pursue righteousness and godliness and faith.
[time=2457] To pursue faith does not mean that it is elusive, but that it is capable of development.
[time=2462] In a sense, we begin our spiritual journey by faith.
[time=2465] Ephesians 2.8 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith." That's where it starts.
[time=2471] But faith is something that can be developed and grow and can be strengthened in our lives.
[time=2476] It must be exercised if it is to be developed properly.
[time=2481] The faith which marks the beginning of our spiritual journey ought not be the faith which also then signifies our status as believers five, ten, fifteen years from then.
[time=2493] For that was fledgling faith, saving faith.
[time=2496] Where's the growth and the development of faith as it's been exercised in your life?
[time=2501] It should be different.
[time=2503] You should recognize the difference.
[time=2506] Pursuit of faith is closely linked, I believe, to the pursuit of godliness.
[time=2510] It's rooted in the word of God.
[time=2512] It demands an act of sense of prayer.
[time=2516] But it sometimes will require us to step out where we have never stepped before.
[time=2521] Witnessing, for instance, is a terrifying thing for many Christians.
[time=2526] And so we say, "I know I should do something about this, but I just don't feel like I'm qualified."
[time=2534] Well, prepare yourself.
[time=2536] Seek to be equipped to share your testimony or the gospel with another person.
[time=2541] And then begin to ask God to provide opportunities to share that testimony and gospel with another person.
[time=2546] And you'll be surprised how many opportunities you will have.
[time=2549] But you've prepared yourself, you've exercised yourself, you've gotten equipped for the work.
[time=2556] And don't be surprised sometimes if in the strengthening of your faith, God asks you to go someplace or do something that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.
[time=2569] I was just a few months short of my 40th birthday when I resigned my pastorate in Michigan to return to school and get a PhD.
[time=2581] People said, "You're just having a midlife crisis.
[time=2585] Go to bed for a couple of days, it'll go away and you'll be fine." After all, nobody asked me to leave the church.
[time=2592] In fact, they wanted me to stay.
[time=2594] So why would a pastor leave when the people want him to stay?
[time=2598] And our children were at a stage in life.
[time=2600] One was heading into the ninth grade, the other went into the sixth grade, where people were saying, "Wow, those are pretty delicate years.
[time=2606] You want to think about this." And they said, "How are you going to support yourself?" We said, "We don't have all of the pieces in place here." All we know is that God wants me to go to the university to get my PhD to prepare for something else that he has for me.
[time=2625] I don't know what that is, I don't know how it's all going to fit together, but we're going to step out on faith.
[time=2633] So I resigned from the church.
[time=2636] Betty Jo, my wife, is a registered nurse.
[time=2638] She agreed to go back and work full time to provide some sustenance for our family as we made this change in our life.
[time=2646] The big questions, of course, were what's going to happen to our girls, and how are we going to provide the additional money we need to pay for tuition and books?
[time=2656] And then how do we find the extra money we're going to need to just cover life with a couple of teenage daughters?
[time=2662] We moved out of a wonderful home in Kalamazoo, Michigan, a big colonial home with four bedrooms and a living room and family room and dining room, and we moved into a two bedroom, one bathroom townhouse in Lansing, Michigan, to go to Michigan State University.
[time=2678] You remember now, I have one wife, two daughters, we had one bathroom.
[time=2682] You know where I fell in the morning totem pole.
[time=2685] I could either be there at five-thirty and have it first, or eight-thirty and have it last, or from six to eight, it was literally a no man's land.
[time=2693] So we made the transition.
[time=2696] Three weeks before we moved, I received a letter from Michigan State University offering me a fellowship that would provide all of the expenses
[time=2705] for the first year of my doctoral program.
[time=2708] Three weeks after we arrived, I received a phone call from the chairman of a church in the Lansing area saying, "Our pastor just recently resigned, your name has been suggested to us as someone who might be able to serve as our interim pastor." And after I had been with the church and we had talked some things through, God opened up a door for me to serve as interim pastor, and all of a sudden, pieces began to fit together.
[time=2733] There was the money there for the schooling.
[time=2736] There was the additional money we needed to make up the difference between what Betty Jo's salary would provide and what our expenses were, and then school for the girls.
[time=2746] And that fall they entered a school that they had never been to before where they knew absolutely no one convinced that they would never have a friend again
[time=2755] in their life.
[time=2757] And by Thanksgiving, as we drove to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with family, they were saying, "You know, I have better friends here in just a couple of months than I ever had in Kalamazoo." But you know what it took?
[time=2771] It took that first step.
[time=2774] Even though we didn't have all of the answers.
[time=2777] And you know what happened as a result of all of that?
[time=2779] Our faith was strengthened.
[time=2781] So when we made a move here this year, and Sarah is now transitioning from 10th grade to 11th grade last summer, there was a great deal of confidence about moving into a new school, because she'd seen God work a few years earlier.
[time=2798] And our faith muscles were stronger because of that experience.
[time=2803] You want to be a man of faith, you have to be willing to step out, sometimes going where you've never been before, because God is leading you there, even though you don't have all of the answers and all of the pieces in place.
[time=2813] Because that's faith.
[time=2817] And the strengthening of faith.
[time=2820] A man of God pursues righteousness and godliness and faith and love, it says.
[time=2827] Now recognize that the love we are called to pursue has nothing to do with emotions and feelings.
[time=2831] We're not talking warm fuzzies here.
[time=2834] We're talking about a commitment.
[time=2837] It is theologically motivated.
[time=2839] 1 John chapter 4 verse 10, "In this is love, not that we love God, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the payment for our sin.
[time=2846] Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another's." That's love which is evidenced in commitment and action.
[time=2856] It goes far beyond the husband to the wife.
[time=2860] I love you.
[time=2862] Or the father to the children.
[time=2865] I love you.
[time=2866] It's action.
[time=2869] It's demonstrated love.
[time=2872] It's the kind of love talked about in 1 Corinthians 13, that familiar passage on love.
[time=2877] But if you read it, you will notice that wrapped up in the center of that chapter are actions which evidence love.
[time=2885] Beginning at verse 4, "Love is patient.
[time=2888] Love is kind and is not jealous.
[time=2891] Love does not brag and is not arrogant.
[time=2893] Love does not act unbecoming like.
[time=2895] It does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered.
[time=2900] Love does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth.
[time=2904] Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
[time=2911] Love never fails." That's not feeling.
[time=2916] That's action.
[time=2918] Those aren't emotions.
[time=2920] That's commitment.
[time=2922] And the kind of love which needs to mark our lives is not wrapped up in warm fuzzies, it's wrapped up in commitment and action.
[time=2932] The feelings come.
[time=2935] Greatfully.
[time=2937] But the feelings isn't where it starts.
[time=2940] Today is Father's Day.
[time=2943] And oftentimes on Father's Day, there are gifts given to fathers.
[time=2949] Let me suggest that you give a gift to your children today.
[time=2954] It won't cost you anything, but it will cost you everything.
[time=2960] It's the gift of love for their mother, for your wife.
[time=2966] Love your wife.
[time=2968] Love her not just with words, but with actions.
[time=2971] Create for your children the stability of a loving relationship between husband and wife.
[time=2976] It is one of the greatest gifts that you can give to them.
[time=2980] As I work with young people through the university, as I have been involved in youth ministry with youth for Christ,
[time=2987] as I have worked in the pastoral ministry, this is such a simple gift, yet such a very difficult gift,
[time=2996] but ultimately an extremely important gift.
[time=3000] Men love your wives, love your children.
[time=3005] Pursue love.
[time=3007] Give yourself in loving actions to your family, to those of the family of faith.
[time=3017] And give yourself in love to the unbeliever.
[time=3021] While there are a couple more here, there's perseverance, or in some Bibles it's translated patience, but it's really more than patience, it's really the ability to stand your ground.
[time=3031] The picture is out of a tree, beat upon by the storms of life.
[time=3037] The lightning cracks, the thunder rolls, the wind begins to blow, and that tree bends under the strain.
[time=3042] The wind beats down upon that tree, but when the storm passes the tree stands again, tall and straight and strong.
[time=3050] As the winter storms come again, the tree bows under the heavy weight of the snow.
[time=3056] It experiences all the harshness of the freezing temperatures, but in spring it begins to throb with life.
[time=3066] For a time when we were living in Kalamazoo, we were able to own a cottage on Gold Lake.
[time=3072] And it had there in the front, up by the water's edge, some beautiful trees.
[time=3077] And we'd watched some storms come rolling across Gold Lake in the summertime.
[time=3082] And you could kind of see the front as it moved across the water, and all of a sudden that storm would hit, and those trees would begin to sway in the wind.
[time=3090] And through the flashes of lightning, we could see them bowed under the weight of the storm.
[time=3096] When the storm would pass, it would always stand.
[time=3099] That's what we're talking about here.
[time=3101] There's perseverance, standing firm under pressure, the ability to stand your ground for the man of God,
[time=3108] the storms of life will come.
[time=3110] We are not immune from those. We're not exempt from them.
[time=3115] It may be the realization that dreams you had for life will not be realized.
[time=3122] A painful time when that which you had hoped for is acknowledged to be an unfulfilled dream.
[time=3130] It may be the loss of a parent, or a spouse, or a child.
[time=3137] It may be a personal illness. It may be ridicule for your Christian faith.
[time=3141] It could be any number of things, but we must stand our ground.
[time=3147] We must persevere. We must not give up when beat upon by the storms of life.
[time=3155] Stephen Maria sang a song. It's to a bit of a Calypso beat.
[time=3159] It came out a few years ago in one of their earlier albums.
[time=3163] Nothing can happen to me today. Nothing good. Nothing bad.
[time=3168] Nothing can happen to me today without passing through my father's hands.
[time=3172] As the storms of life begin to beat upon us, we can persevere because we acknowledge that this isn't happening by accident.
[time=3179] God isn't off doing something else.
[time=3183] We can be strong because He is there to support us and to encourage us and to enable us.
[time=3190] And in the middle of the storm I remind you of Jesus our example.
[time=3195] In Hebrews 12-2 it says, "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
[time=3202] who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
[time=3209] and then sat down at the right hand in the throne of God." That's perseverance. That needs to mark our lives.
[time=3220] The final quality is gentleness. Some versions translate it meekness, but that's not really true because we oftentimes think of meekness as mousiness and gentleness is not mousiness. It's really restrained strength.
[time=3233] In the classical Greek it was the picture of the wild horse that is brought into captivity
[time=3239] and trained to go by bit and bridle. All of the strength and energy of that powerful animal is still there.
[time=3245] It's now controlled and channeled into productive means.
[time=3249] Scripture calls us to gentleness.
[time=3253] We are called to be gentle men.
[time=3257] Restrained strength.
[time=3260] Gentle in our dealings with fallen fellow believers, Galatians 6-1, recognizing that we too may fall prey to sin's temptations.
[time=3269] Gentleness in dealing with unbelieving friends as we seek to share with them the Gospel of Jesus Christ, 1 Peter 3, 15, because we find that people are more easily persuaded to follow Christ when given a reasonable presentation than when confronted in angry and harsh ways.
[time=3289] Gentle in dealing with our children by not being unreasonable and provoking them to anger Ephesians 6-4.
[time=3299] The man of God I believe is gentle when he realizes he does not always have to be right.
[time=3305] That sometimes that's just not important.
[time=3309] The man of God is gentle when he acknowledges that he doesn't always have to assert his opinion.
[time=3315] That sometimes he can just be kept to himself.
[time=3320] That's gentleness.
[time=3323] Men, I challenge you to be men of God.
[time=3327] As desperately as our culture, our country, our community needs, men who love their wives and love their children and are committed to being good citizens, what we really need are men who will be men of God.
[time=3343] Because when you and I are men of God, all of the other pieces will be there.
[time=3349] I call upon you to run away from those things and keep on running away from those things which would distract you from being a man of God, especially false teaching and an all-consuming desire to be wealthy.
[time=3363] Instead, I challenge you to engage in a lifelong pursuit of righteousness,
[time=3370] godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
[time=3379] May our lives be marked by those qualities in such a way that when people see us
[time=3386] and remember us and talk about us, they will know that we are men of God.
