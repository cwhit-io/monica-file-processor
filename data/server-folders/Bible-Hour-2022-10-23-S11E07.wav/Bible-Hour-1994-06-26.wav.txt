[time=0] (bell ringing)
[time=30] This is the way that a Christian should purpose in his or her heart to faithfully respond
[time=60] to the truth of God's Word.
[time=62] And so we're going to spend the morning thinking about how we respond to God's truth.
[time=73] (music playing)
[time=80] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=86] find to be an encouragement.
[time=89] Thank you for joining us.
[time=90] The message God has for us today in James chapter 1 deals with a common and prevalent
[time=96] ailment that exists in the body of Christ.
[time=99] All too often we become part of hearing.
[time=102] The sin in our lives acts like wax in the ear which, if allowed to build up, can eventually impair a person's hearing.
[time=109] This hearing problem has crippling effects upon our lives.
[time=112] It neutralizes our impact and nullifies our testimony.
[time=116] God calls us to clean up our lives so that we can hear and obey what He's calling us to do.
[time=123] Our special music today will be presented by Scott Schindler and by Celebration.
[time=134] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=151] (music playing)

[time=624] (applause)
[time=630] Well, I want to remind those of you that live in the Fort Wayne area that today we're presenting our annual Patriotic Panorama at 4 p.m. right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. You've heard about it. I hope you can come and join us for America. I love you. And then I want to tell you about our telephone address book that we're offering this month. It's in commemoration of our 25th anniversary of the church. You can receive this address book absolutely free. If you just write to the Bible hour at 7400 East State, you'll be able to make a donation to the church and you'll be able to come back to the church.
[time=659] We're here at East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815. Let's hear from you today.
[time=666] (music playing)
[time=681] A mother cries. She keeps asking, "Why did it happen?" Her only son.
[time=702] Now lies silent there before her.
[time=711] All but death isn't there. And those we love will see again someday. We won't cry anymore someday.
[time=734] We won't ask why anymore someday. He will close the door to sorrow someday.
[time=749] (music playing)
[time=765] Our broken heart sometimes can be much too painful. We all have times.
[time=785] We question the circumstances.
[time=795] Oh, but when our father appears. His gentle touch will dry our tears someday.
[time=811] We won't cry anymore someday. We won't ask why anymore someday.
[time=825] He will close the door to sorrow someday.
[time=845] No more sorrow, and no more tears someday. We won't cry anymore someday.
[time=861] We won't ask why anymore someday. He will close the door to sorrow someday someday.
[time=877] We won't cry anymore someday. We won't ask why anymore someday.
[time=893] He will close the door to sorrow someday.
[time=923] Thank you celebration. Beautiful rendition of Revelation chapter 21 verse 4 with the Lord promises when we're finally in heaven to take away all pain and sorrow and wipe away the tears from our eyes.
[time=943] Let's take our Bibles this morning and come to James chapter 1. We're studying this book as we move through its great truth.
[time=952] If you've been away, we've come to James chapter 1 verses 19 to 27, and it's a whole new section of thought.
[time=959] As the letter opened, James taught us how to respond properly to trials and hardship in our life.
[time=966] Having concluded that in verse 18, he shifts his focus now to teach us how to respond to the Word of God, how to be teachable Christians, how we should properly respond to God's truth.
[time=979] And maybe to get our mind thinking about that this morning, I could invite you to keep your finger there in James chapter 1 and come back to the book of Nehemiah.
[time=986] There in the Old Testament, 1st and 2nd Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, that's where you'll find it.
[time=994] Nehemiah chapter 8, because here we find one of the greatest responses by the people of God to the Word of God in all of holy writ.
[time=1005] And it so parallels the instruction that James wants to give us in chapter 1 that it really serves us well to take a moment and understand and review and remember just exactly how wonderful it was when the people properly responded to God's Word.
[time=1019] As you remember, Nehemiah is a part of the return from exile. God is trying to bring his people back from years and years of exile in Babylon. He wants them to rebuild the temple and the wall to reestablish Jerusalem and the nation of Israel to await for her coming king.
[time=1035] Great trial and struggle throughout that whole period of history, but a bright moment here in chapter 8, verse 1.
[time=1042] And all the people gathered as one man at the square which was in front of the water gate. And they asked Ezra to describe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord had given to Israel.
[time=1054] Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly of men, women and all who could listen and understand.
[time=1060] And on the first day of the seventh month, he read from it before the square and was in front of the water gate from early morning until midday in the presence of men and women, those who could understand.
[time=1071] And all the people were attentive to the book of the law. Now verse 8. And they read from the book from the law of God translating to give the sense so that they understood the reading.
[time=1084] The translation there was kind of a double meaning. Some of the people needed it to go from Hebrew and its original writing into Aramic because they had been born in Babylon and didn't know their nation's native tongue.
[time=1095] But it's also a reference to expository preaching, not just to read the text, but then to come on and explain the text and try to make it relevant to people's lives.
[time=1105] And so that's what was occurring, went on all day like that.
[time=1109] Well the people's response is recorded in verse 9. Then Nehemiah who was the governor and Ezra, the priest and scribe and the Levites who taught the people, said to the people,
[time=1119] "This day is holy to the Lord your God, do not mourn or weep, for all the people were weeping when they heard the words of the law."
[time=1127] Verse 9 kind of comes at it backwards. The way it works is people gathered themselves, the preaching of the Word of God, the reading of the Word of God.
[time=1134] They were so convicted by their own sinfulness that they began to weep and mourn just openly, publicly.
[time=1142] And Nehemiah and Ezra and the Levites had to come and say to them, "Don't do that because this is not an appropriate activity on this particular day.
[time=1150] It was the feast of trumpets and it's supposed to be a time of celebration." And interestingly the people stopped their mourning and they stopped their weeping and they went on and did exactly what they were supposed to do according to Leviticus for this particular celebration which was a time of great rejoicing.
[time=1167] And it was a festival of sorts. So there's immediate response and obedience to the Word of God.
[time=1172] They are finished with that part of the ceremony several days later, verse 13.
[time=1177] Then on the second day the heads of Father's households, of all the people, the priests and the Levites were gathered to Ezra, the scribe, that they might gain insight into the words of the law.
[time=1188] So as soon as they're done observing this first bit of obedience and that feast of trumpets is over, they come back and say, "Okay, what's next?"
[time=1196] And they find themselves by Levitical law in yet another feast, the tabernacles.
[time=1201] And it's said in the law that they were not to live in their own homes during this particular period of time.
[time=1206] In fact they should make for themselves booths and stay in these booths, verse 16.
[time=1212] So the people went out and brought them and made booths for themselves, each one on his roof and in their courts and the courts of the house of God, and in the square at the water gate and in the square of the gate of Ephraim.
[time=1225] And the entire assembly of those who had returned from the captivity made booths and lived in them.
[time=1232] The sons of Israel had indeed not done so from the days of Joshua the son of none to that day, and there was great rejoicing.
[time=1240] Now I hope you understand, this is just a massive commitment on all the people to observe the law of God.
[time=1247] And it's emphasized in verse 17, the entire assembly, everybody in the nation went out and got the proper preparations, made the booth and got out of their house and into the booth,
[time=1258] and that obedience and the marvel and the wonder of that is punctuated by the fact that this nation had not done that for hundreds of years, even since the days of Joshua.
[time=1268] Now in chapter 9 they finally get to do what they want to do at the beginning, look at it.
[time=1274] Now on the 24th day of this month, in other words after they have properly observed, first the feast of trumpets, then the tabernacles.
[time=1281] The sons of Israel assembled themselves with fasting in sackcloth, with dirt upon them, and the descendants of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquity of their fathers.
[time=1295] While they stood in their place, they read from the book of the law of the Lord their God for a fourth of the day, and for another fourth they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God.
[time=1306] Having then observed those festivals, they could now do what they really wanted to do, which is just to have a wholesale confession of their sin, weeping and mourning, sackcloth and ashes, dirt upon their heads, saying, "Oh God, forgive us for our sinfulness."
[time=1323] They got very serious about this and purposed in their hearts never again to allow the nation of Israel to slip so much as was in their power in disobedience to God's Word that if you look at the end of chapter 9 verse 38, they are writing their own covenant.
[time=1338] Now because of all this, they say, we are making an agreement in writing, and on the sealed document are the names of our leaders and our Levites and our priests.
[time=1350] They're saying, "Man, not only do we want to respond now, but we want to make an agreement, a covenant of sorts, we want to put it in writing, we want to have our leadership sign it, we refuse to deviate again from the law of God."
[time=1362] Now folks, that is a great moment in the history of God's people. You can make your way back to James now.
[time=1368] That is a radical wholesale commitment to be under the preaching and the teaching and the study of God's Word and then to apply it to their lives no matter what the cause.
[time=1380] And I find it so interesting that even though their first reaction was to want to mourn and weep and repent, obedience demanded otherwise, so first they celebrated, then they got in booths, and finally they got to do what was really the inclination of their heart, which was to repent.
[time=1395] This is an unbridled, unashamed, unabashed commitment to obey the Word of God.
[time=1402] We can think back to the days of King Josiah, the young king who when the law was found and was read in his court, he ripped his robes in repentance over the violation of his nation from the Word of God and began immediately to rectify the situation.
[time=1416] We can think to a great moment of conviction in David's life when confronted by Nathan the prophet and how his heart was filled with conviction and repentance followed.
[time=1428] The Bereans in Acts 17 are remembered as the noble-minded because they received the Word of God with eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if the things taught them were true.
[time=1441] This is the way that God would have us respond to the Word of God.
[time=1445] That is the standard, that is the way basically that we should constantly be responding to the truth of God's Word, whether we hear it taught from the pulpit, from the radio, or from our own study of His Word.
[time=1457] And there is no question those are the happiest moments of our life when God's Word is driving deeply into our hearts and we are seeking repentance from our sin.
[time=1469] The great question though that faces us as Christians is this, how in the world can we maintain that posture of teachability under the truth?
[time=1479] You and I have both experienced great moments of conviction from the preaching, teaching, and studying of God's Word, but we can also attest to the fact that it's very easy for us to become indifferent to the truth.
[time=1492] It's very easy for us to be swamped in good biblical teaching from your A.B.F., from the pulpit, from the radio ministry, from your own study, and we can feel overloaded with truth, and pretty soon we become indifferent to that truth, and the issue no longer is to be convicted and to change in light of that truth.
[time=1511] And so that's what this passage is about. How can I maintain a teachable posture underneath the truth of God's Word and maintain a regular consistent response to the Word of God that would be similar to those in Nehemiah's Day or Josiah's Day, to that of David, to that of the Bereans?
[time=1530] And it's a great question. It's a very practical question. Of course that's the book of James in its entirety, a very practical book.
[time=1536] Well from these verses I just want to draw three basic statements that may help you, and I think he really has three categories of people in mind here.
[time=1546] And so I've given a statement to describe the folly of each category of person, and you may find yourself in one category, a couple of them or all of them, but listen attentively, won't you?
[time=1556] With an introspective heart to say which one of these speaks most directly to me, so that I can maintain or re-enter a posture of teachability under the Word of God.
[time=1568] The first is a little statement to this. One, don't be defensive. Don't be defensive to the teaching of God's truth.
[time=1577] Sometimes one category of people is that when God's truth is spoken, they become defensive against it.
[time=1585] And what you find in verse 19 is one of the best descriptions of a defensive person you'll ever find anywhere in writing.
[time=1594] This you know, I'm in James 1-19, this you know my beloved brethren, let everyone be quick to hear slow to speak and slow to anger.
[time=1603] Now reverse those and you'll find the perfect definition of a defensive person. He is not quick to hear. In fact, he barely listens to you at all.
[time=1612] As soon as an offensive person begins to get the drift of what you're going to say to them, if it's confronted at all, they shut you off and stop listening.
[time=1620] They don't let you finish your sentence. They don't let you finish what you had in your mind to say. They simply don't want to hear it.
[time=1627] They just put the barriers up and they may do that non-verbally or verbally.
[time=1633] Typically then what they'll do after they stop listening to you is they start speaking. Some people who are extroverts do it with their lips.
[time=1640] Others who are introverts don't really want you to know what they're thinking, but they start a process of speaking either to themselves or the people who can hear them.
[time=1647] That is a justifying, rationalizing, denying, explaining away type mentality. And they just run on in their mouth such that they can't hear.
[time=1658] And that is motivated typically, the third thing, by a very angry spirit.
[time=1663] Defensive people are typically this way. They do not listen. They start talking to defend themselves and they talk out of an angry heart.
[time=1673] Proverbs 29.11 says, "A fool always loses his temper."
[time=1679] Is that you? When you are being confronted with the truth of God's word, either through a sermon or through the lips of a friend,
[time=1686] do you find that you become angry? And that you really don't want to listen to what they're saying?
[time=1694] And the quicker you can shut them up by starting to explain away what they have intimated in the first, maybe a couple of words or a couple of sentences that you let them say.
[time=1704] And you find that that's being motivated by a very defensive and angry spirit in your heart that removes your teachability.
[time=1714] I remember many years ago before I came to Fort Wayne, I was trying to help an individual, a guy, a man, married man in the church for many years,
[time=1721] thought himself to be very, very spiritual, but had reached a point in his marriage where he was done with his marriage.
[time=1726] And he had all these reasons why that justified his unbiblical divorce. He had no grounds for a biblical divorce.
[time=1734] I asked him to come by and visit, and there was a fellow pastor with me in the room, and we had prayed and were very soft and very gentle.
[time=1742] And simply he said, "Would you please be willing to take your Bible and look at Matthew 19 for just a moment?" And he didn't know what was in Matthew 19, so he complied with that. He comes to Matthew 19 and it's the Lord's talking about divorce,
[time=1755] and that the only grounds for divorce between two believers is if there's been adultery.
[time=1760] And as soon as he got the drift of that passage, he put the Bible down, he stopped reading it, he wouldn't allow us to say a thing and said this,
[time=1768] "I don't care what this says." Is that defensive? I mean, that's like, I don't want to hear anything you have to say.
[time=1777] I don't want to hear the Bible. I don't care what it says. I am getting a divorce.
[time=1785] Got up and walked away. The next week sent us a letter revoking his membership in the church, a very angry letter, a very insulting letter,
[time=1795] a very demeaning letter accusing me, accusing my associate, and then later threatened lawsuits against the church.
[time=1803] That is what I call a defensive person, and it is the classic response.
[time=1808] And you, I say it to you in an exaggerated form, you need to look in your own heart and say, "Is that me?" Now, how does he want us to respond? Instead of being defensive, let's look at it in the positive.
[time=1817] He wants you to be quick to hear that describes an eagerness and an attentiveness, a readiness to receive and to assimilate a message.
[time=1828] He wants us to be slow to speak, and that indicates after the message has been received, instead of trying to respond right away,
[time=1835] be wise enough to allow time and reflect and evaluate and examine the truth and its application to your life.
[time=1843] And then, of course, resist or be slow to anger, why? Verse 20, "For the anger of man does not achieve the righteousness of God."
[time=1850] Very interesting statement. There are a few exceptions to that statement.
[time=1854] There is something called righteous indignation, and we see it in our Lord when He makes the scourge and drives the money changers out of the temple.
[time=1862] We see it occasionally in the life of Paul as he is angry at false prophets and false teachers for leading people into deception,
[time=1869] and we can feel the venom of his anger in 1st and 2nd Peter.
[time=1873] But that is such a rare occurrence.
[time=1876] I would be willing to say it this way, 99% of the time that you and I are angry, it is not accomplishing the righteousness of God.
[time=1885] Anger is most often a self-protective response, a sinful self-protective response to being challenged in our life with the truth of God, or failing to get our way.
[time=1896] Anger is typically a very ungodly response.
[time=1900] And certainly in this context, to be angry at the Word of God, and it's penetrating power in your life, whether it is the spoken Word of God, or the Word of a friend, or your own study, is simply to not achieve the righteousness of God.
[time=1916] So he says this, "My Christian friend, don't be defensive. Listen and ponder and invite further probing and counsel."
[time=1931] When the Word of God is touching on an area of weakness in your life, be still and ask the Lord to reveal the root causes that find their way into your heart.
[time=1941] Plead with God to show you the tributaries of that sin and its multiplied impact upon your life, your spouse, your children, your church, your friends, your place of employment.
[time=1954] Treasure the moment of conviction.
[time=1960] A little bit like those 3D pictures. Have you been in the mall lately and seen those? They seem to be everywhere. They stand up in those little kiosks in the middle, and everybody's standing there looking, and for the longest time I have to admit, I just stood there and kind of pretended that I saw what everybody else saw, because I'd never learned the little art of looking more deeply into those pictures.
[time=1977] In the seclusion and privacy of one of our staff meetings, Tim Teder brought in one, and I was brave enough to say, "You know, I've never really seen anything in any of these."
[time=1986] And so he put a plastic covering on it, which made a glare, and said, "Now look at the glare." And eventually my eyes refocused, and I could see what was in this nonsense.
[time=1997] And what emerges is a 3D picture of some rams on these mountain tops, and at first I saw one ram, but once your eyes get focused, you can start looking around all inside. It comes in 3D, and we could just explore all the dimensions of what was inside there.
[time=2014] That's what he's saying. When the Word of God comes to you in conviction, focus, and ponder, and pause, and probe, and look with intensity to all the facets and dimensions of that sin in your life.
[time=2032] Don't be a fool. Don't be defensive. Stop listening. Start talking and get angry. There's no growth there. You prove yourself to be an unteachable person.
[time=2046] He goes on, under the same heading, don't be defensive, and he moves past that first blush response to the Word by talking about a habitual practice in your life in verse 21. Look what he wants you to do.
[time=2059] Therefore, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness in humility received the Word implanted, which is able to save your souls.
[time=2069] At first phrase, putting aside all filthiness and all that remains of wickedness is a metaphor describing taking off dirty clothes.
[time=2078] And you see here is the positive perspective that God has and wants us to adopt about our own sin. He says, "View your filthiness." That's a word that talks about moral compromise, behavior that is immoral.
[time=2094] Wickedness talks about ill will and malice. Wickedness is a term that talks about sin inside of relationships, and this word filthiness talks about moral compromise.
[time=2107] He says, "View this stuff as a filthy, dirty garment and be looking forward to getting it off." I was flying home from California, just the other day here, Saturday, Friday, and I had taken Bobby, my son, because he flies free.
[time=2125] And so I could take him out to California and just literally show him off to everybody I ever knew out there, which was a great time.
[time=2132] Well, we're coming back in. We're taking a little puddle jump from Chicago back into Fort Wayne, and it's one of those American Eagle props, and I don't think there was a bathroom on board, and it was packed. There wasn't an open seat anywhere.
[time=2145] And we're about ready to make our descent, which is about a 15-minute process. And so the pilot puts on that little sign, you know, fast in your seat belts and then tells everybody you've got to stay in your seats because we're making descent.
[time=2156] Well, Bobby, who's been sitting on my lap, wants to stand up. So he stands up and turns around and looks at me, and pretty soon his face is getting red. He's pushing. He's grunting.
[time=2169] And he's doing his little number there, you know, right there in his pants.
[time=2174] And all of a sudden, the whole fuselage of this little plane is full of his aroma. And there's not a thing any of us can do about it.
[time=2187] I can't get up. I try to strain back. I'm thinking, I'll break the rules. I'll go back there in that bathroom and I'll get this thing changed and hopefully, you know, throw it out a window or something.
[time=2195] But there is no bathroom. I'm certainly not going to try to change him right here on my lap. That would, you know, exponentially exaggerate the situation. So there's Bobby and me.
[time=2208] And you can notice everybody is kind of moving away and they're coughing and some people are reaching for their handkerchiefs and other people are wishing that thing would drop from the ceiling.
[time=2217] I mean, it's bad news. We're stinking this place up bad. We finally touched down. And I'm thinking, oh baby, we're done. We're out of this plane.
[time=2228] But you remember then, oh yeah, we got a taxi down. We got to turn the corner. We got to sit there. They got to turn the engines off. They got to open the door.
[time=2236] And everybody's just like pacing and waiting. And they opened the door and we're gone like a shot.
[time=2245] I get him in his little stroller and I'm pushing him across the open spaces there until that gate number, whatever, was two or three.
[time=2251] And there's my whole family excited to greet us and tell. They get a whiff of Bob. They back up and say the bathroom's over there.
[time=2261] I took Bobby to the men's room and changed and was rid, you see, of his filthy garment. That is what God is saying.
[time=2270] Don't you understand? Why would you want to stay in these things? Why would you want to perpetuate a life of filthiness and wickedness?
[time=2280] It's such a positive perspective. Be gone with it and happily and the sooner the better.
[time=2287] And then it says in verse 21, "In humility, receive the word implanted. In brokenness over your own sin, receive the word of God."
[time=2297] And that is a different metaphor implanted, of course, an agricultural term which is saying, "Let this seed of the truth of God's word as it relates to a particular area of weakness in your life.
[time=2307] Let it settle in fertile soil and grow to a marvelous testimony into the power of God."
[time=2316] So he's just begging with us. Don't be defensive. I didn't give you the word of God so you could become angry against it and be slow to hear and quick to speak and defensively to just submit to it.
[time=2328] You say, "Well, what is that like?" Well, that's like getting rid of filthy junk and then letting this healthy, wholesome seed of his word begin to take root and grow you to a place you'd never have been before.
[time=2344] So be teachable. Secondly, another way to keep a teachable posture, I'll say it this way, seek transformation, not information.
[time=2357] Seek transformation, not information. And that's in these next few verses, one of the most famous in the book of James, verse 22, "But prove yourselves doers of the word and not merely hearers who delude themselves."
[time=2372] You can see the progression of thought. First, you've got to hear the word and if you're defensive, you can't even hear it.
[time=2378] Secondly, many of us find ourselves in a category of liking to hear the word. We enjoy it.
[time=2386] We listen to the nation's best preachers on our radio stations and we want to come here and be fed by our ABF Bible teachers and from our pulpit and we're hoping that God will really stir our hearts with the truth.
[time=2401] And we enjoy it when the truth is proclaimed with passion and power and clarity in a relevant way and we can feel it convicting our hearts. We love to hear the word of God.
[time=2412] In fact, I know without a shadow of a doubt that if I were to stand up here for more than one Sunday by virtue of an oversight and speak falsehood to you, you would throw me out of your church and you would find somebody else who could preach the truth.
[time=2426] You love to hear the truth and so do I. You have no idea how many sermons I'll listen to in any given week. I have my favorite preachers and I pop them in my headset and I listen to them preach and I love it when they put me under their spell.
[time=2441] I love it when they draw me in and get me thinking along this path and then bring convicting truth from God's word. It's just a fascinating process.
[time=2451] The word of God is saying though that is not the ultimate end of this process. Do not seek information alone. Seek transformation. Seek a transformed life.
[time=2463] Seek information so that it will utterly transform your life and make you into someone that you were not before.
[time=2471] He uses two very interesting words in verse 22. The first that I want to highlight is to be a hearer. Don't just be a hearer. That's from the Greek word from which we also get the word to audit.
[time=2483] You know what you do when you audit a class? You sit in on the class and you get to listen to everything but you don't do any of the homework.
[time=2492] You never have to prepare the papers. You don't have to do the reading assignments. You don't have to study for the final because you don't have to take the final.
[time=2500] He is saying do not become spiritual auditors of truth. Do not content yourself in coming under the preaching of the word of God, evaluating it to see if it's true, even letting it stir your heart because it is true and think, see now I've done my Christianity.
[time=2519] Don't audit the truth. Go do your homework is what he's saying. Take that truth and find its application into your life.
[time=2529] The doer where there be a doer is a word that describes the characterization of a person's life. Don't just fight an award, become a soldier.
[time=2538] Don't just teach a lesson, become a teacher. Don't just build a house, become a builder. Let it be the prevailing, dominating characteristic of your life that you are in the constant process of applying God's truth to your life.
[time=2552] And the way to do that is refuse to be satisfied with gaining new information. You must seek personal transformation in your life.
[time=2561] Okay, so he illustrates it in verses 23 and 24 and 25. A little word picture here. If anyone is a hearer of the word, an auditor and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his natural face in the mirror for once he has looked at himself and gone away.
[time=2575] He has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was, but one who looks intently at the law, the law of liberty and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer, but an effectual doer, this man shall be blessed in what he does.
[time=2589] Now that mirrors in this particular day were rather crude, they were polished bronze or silver or gold, but we understand that you could gain a relatively accurate reflection of your appearance.
[time=2600] And I'm sure that mirrors in that day were used for the same thing they're used today. You want to look at yourself and say, "Uh-oh, before I go into public, some things need to be corrected here."
[time=2613] And the illustration, this is so powerfully relevant because you and I would never do this physically.
[time=2621] You and I would never have gotten up this morning looking the way we looked and walked into our bathrooms and turned the light on and saw clearly exactly what needs to be fixed.
[time=2635] And then said to ourselves, "Huh, no big deal. I think I'll just get dressed." Bypass the repairs, put on the clothes and come to church looking like you look up when you crawl out of it.
[time=2646] It's inconceivable. There is no possible way that we would do that. That's what he's saying.
[time=2653] Why would you do that with your heart? Why would you do that with your character? Why would you do that with your life?
[time=2660] And the answer comes back silently between the lines because I can be hypocritical.
[time=2666] If I don't fix my face in the mirror, everybody would know that when I came to church.
[time=2671] And they'd say, "What in the world happened to you?" First, they might say, "Who are you?" They might not recognize you.
[time=2677] But if they did, they'd say, "What are you doing?" But you understand, as Christians, we can come under the conviction of the preaching of the Word of God.
[time=2686] It's a private conviction because it's an internal sin or a private sin and not change it.
[time=2692] And come to church in pretense and hypocrisy.
[time=2696] And so he says, "Don't be like that." And that is why I advocate strongly high levels of personal, intimate accountability.
[time=2707] So that there are people in your life to whom you can say, "I just looked in the mirror and this is exactly what I saw."
[time=2715] And I really need to make the changes. Will you hold me accountable? Will you help me?
[time=2720] Because I don't want to be a pretender.
[time=2724] Because if you don't have that kind of accountability, it is so easy to pretend.
[time=2731] Now again, he puts this in a very, very positive light. I just want to draw two little phrases here that I like so much.
[time=2738] In verse 25, the one who looks intently at the perfect law, then he calls it this, "The Law of Liberty."
[time=2746] People who do not want to repent from their sin typically refuse to do that because they think they're going to give up something valuable.
[time=2755] They don't want to have to change their lifestyle. They're afraid of obeying God because they think it's going to ruin their life.
[time=2760] And they view God as a cosmic killjoy that is seeking to destroy a person's life and make it dull and boring.
[time=2767] The Word of God never portrays obedience in that light.
[time=2771] Sometimes obedience is described as hard. Sometimes obedience is described as painful.
[time=2777] But it is always described as the most positive, proactive, healthy, liberating expression of a human's life.
[time=2786] Let me say it to you this way. You will never give up the true quality of your life by obeying God.
[time=2792] You will only give up the bondage of sin.
[time=2796] The law of liberty is contrasted to the bondage of sin.
[time=2800] And why would you want to live shackled by yourself, defeating, incriminating, crunching, guilt-filling sin when you could be liberated by just obeying God?
[time=2812] You find your greatest expression of who you are when you repent and walk in the liberty of his truth.
[time=2817] You are never more what God wanted you to be than when you walk in obedience.
[time=2822] And then he says at the end of that verse, the man who does this will be blessed in what he does.
[time=2829] Then we've all been looking and watching a living example of someone who was blessed physically but has not been blessed internally by his rejection of God's truth.
[time=2839] You could be compared to O.J. Simpson as far as physical blessing and the physical capacity is both his appearance and his ability to run a football and all the talents that God has given him.
[time=2850] Circumstantially, yes, blessed beyond his wildest dreams, but he has rejected consistently the counsel of God's word.
[time=2858] And so is his life blessed? No, guilty or not, the things that he has done, ruining his life, throwing away everything that God had given him.
[time=2870] Why? Because he failed to heed the counsel of God's word, compromised his integrity.
[time=2878] So the blessing is not to be confused with circumstantial blessing, the blessing God wants to give you is the blessing of walking a life full of integrity and character, and there is no greater blessing.
[time=2892] So how do I made a teachable spirit? One, don't be defensive. Two, seek transformation, not information in this last one.
[time=2900] Thirdly, beware of becoming spiritually complacent. Beware of becoming spiritually complacent. What do I mean by that?
[time=2913] Well, to borrow on the analogy of the mirror, don't become like the fawns. Remember in Happy Days? That famous little clip of him that's been played a zillion times where he walks into a restroom, looks in the mirror, is pulling out his comb, and just, well, there's nothing to fix.
[time=2929] I mean, good night, puts his comb away and walks out. You know what, we do that as Christians.
[time=2942] We redefine what it means to really love God in external terms, and you'll notice in both 26 and 27 the word religion is used.
[time=2951] If anyone thinks himself to be religious, verse 27, I'll tell you what pure and undefiled religion is.
[time=2959] As believers, this third category is we say that my Christianity is defined this way through my religion, through external behavior, and as long as I'm doing this external behavior, there's nothing to fix.
[time=2975] As a result, I lose my sense of teachability, and the word of God becomes stale to me because I have no need to learn anything new because there's nothing wrong.
[time=2986] So he reaches back, James does, into, I believe, his experiences with the Lord, and he brings out two litmus tests of true faith in Christ.
[time=3000] This is the standard to which if we faithfully compare ourselves, we will always find ourselves coming up short vis-a-vis maintaining a teachable spirit.
[time=3010] The first, look at verse 26, if you think you're religious, yet you do not bridle your own tongue, you deceive your own heart, and your religion is worthless.
[time=3019] You think you're religious because you come to church regularly, and you give, and you have a Bible, and you study your Bible from time to time, and you don't beat your wife, and you don't do this, and you don't do that.
[time=3028] There's your standard, there's your external standard of religion, and God is saying, don't look at that, look at your tongue, because it speaks out of that which fills the heart.
[time=3039] It's uncontrollable, and we'll learn more about that in James 3.
[time=3044] If you want to be humbled back under your need for the truth of God's Word, just listen to yourself talk.
[time=3052] Unless we speak about 18,000 words every day, you will find there, I am sure, ample evidence of your need to continue to pursue Christ and grow into the likeness of Jesus Christ.
[time=3065] I know for a fact that is true in my life.
[time=3068] This is an area of struggle in my life.
[time=3071] I fail at this.
[time=3072] I make vows to myself not to fail at this, and then I fail at this again.
[time=3077] And then friends confront me, and I repent, and I make more vows, and then I fail again.
[time=3084] It is just this consistent place of evaluating your true spirituality.
[time=3089] Don't think about your titles, your positions, your accomplishments, your routines, and your religion.
[time=3095] Listen to your tongue, and I promise you, friend, you will be humbled over, and over, and over again.
[time=3102] And you'll come back afresh in a new saying, "Oh God, teach me your truth."
[time=3109] The second one in verse 27.
[time=3112] This is pure and unafiled religion in the sight of our God and Father, to visit orphans and widows in their distress, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
[time=3123] Orphans and widows represent a category of people who are helpless.
[time=3128] Orphans and widows in their distress are the kinds of people who, when you help them, you get nothing in return because they don't have anything to give you.
[time=3138] God in essence is saying, if you think you're religious and you're satisfied and you're complacent in your Christianity, then ask yourself this question.
[time=3145] Who is it in my life that I am faithfully pursuing and loving from whom I can receive nothing in return?
[time=3156] It's the test of true selflessness. Anybody?
[time=3161] Man, talk about being defensive. You could get defensive on this because most of us don't do a lot of this.
[time=3167] Most of us are ministering to people who we get stuff in return from, like our wives and our kids.
[time=3173] We get a lot of return from that.
[time=3176] He's saying if you want to be humbled underneath the reality of your own sinfulness and how far you have to go in becoming like Christ, then ask yourself the question, take the little survey,
[time=3185] who is it in my life, that I am faithfully ministering to that can do nothing in return for me.
[time=3195] That should break your heart, he says. That should humble you. That should show you again a new and a fresh just how incredibly selfish we really are.
[time=3205] The word visit doesn't mean to go by and say hi. The word visit means to minister to their personal needs.
[time=3212] It talks about personal concern and personal contact with their needs. Matthew 25, the Lord said you visited me and he meant ministry.
[time=3222] Okay, so three categories that we tend to fall into. We become defensive against God's word.
[time=3229] We secondly begin to seek information instead of life transformation and we think we're satisfied when we've heard a zinger of a sermon instead of seeing a zinger of a life.
[time=3240] And we become unteachable when we lower the true standard of Christianity down to religion instead of examining ourselves against the measure of our tongue and our selflessness as evidenced by our ministry to people who can't help us.
[time=3255] Three questions now as I close just by way of conclusion.
[time=3259] I'll try to make this as applicable as I can.
[time=3261] I want to give you something you can walk out of here with today to evaluate yourself.
[time=3266] One question from each category, number one from the first category, it's very simple.
[time=3270] Are you angry today?
[time=3273] Are you angry?
[time=3275] Are you angry at God?
[time=3276] Are you angry at your wife?
[time=3280] Are you angry at your circumstances?
[time=3283] If you are angry today, it is likely that you have moved out of a teachable posture and
[time=3289] you are defensive.
[time=3292] Not saying that somebody didn't do something wrong to you, but somebody doing something wrong to you doesn't justify you're becoming angry.
[time=3302] Are you angry today?
[time=3303] And if you are, would you be willing to look into that situation with a pondering gaze
[time=3309] through the light of God's word and ask Him to reveal to you the sin in your life?
[time=3314] So you can go back to a place of reasonableness.
[time=3321] Second question, it comes out of that second section, don't just listen to the truth, do the truth.
[time=3328] Would there be one area in your life today, one area in your life today of disobedience
[time=3335] that you know God wants you to give Him, you know it's impacting the rest of your life,
[time=3342] you know it's leading you down the wrong path, you know it's a matter of time until that thing becomes really ugly.
[time=3347] There's an area of disobedience in your life, you're convicted, you know it's there, but you're not giving it up.
[time=3353] Will you give that up to Him today?
[time=3357] Will you vow in your heart, maybe like in the days of Nehemiah, covenant, maybe you need to write it down, maybe you need to show it to a friend, maybe you need to get the accountability, maybe it's finances, maybe it's time management, maybe it's priorities, maybe it's morality, maybe it's something in your home with your wife or your kids or your job, wherever it is will you give it up.
[time=3374] Will you stop being an auditor of God's truth and become a doer today in just that one area?
[time=3380] And lastly, the last question I want to ask you that comes from the third section was
[time=3386] this, when was the last time you were truly broken over your own sin?
[time=3394] When was the last time you were really shattered in your heart and in your mind and in your emotions over the depravity of your own heart and your own life?
[time=3402] It doesn't necessarily mean you're weeping, but you can really sense that brokenness.
[time=3410] If it's been a long time, it may be because you're happy to evaluate yourself on religious
[time=3418] standards, external standards, rather than taking the penetrating gaze to your tongue
[time=3425] and to your selflessness as evidenced by your ministry to other people.
[time=3430] And if it's been a long time since you've been broken over your sin, I ask you to invite the Spirit of God to open your eyes to your sin in those particular areas so you can maintain
[time=3441] a teachable heart.
[time=3460] Well I hope you enjoyed the music from our Sanctuary Choir and from our organist Scott Schindler and the group Celebration.
[time=3468] A message today was from our pastor, teacher Russell Moore, and was another in the series from the book of James.
[time=3475] If as a result of today's program you decided that you need to make a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, we can take a moment right now and pray this prayer together.

[time=3485] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful that I can come to you right now and tell you that I want to ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today.
[time=3495] I ask you to come into my heart, in Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3501] You prayed that prayer today, why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
