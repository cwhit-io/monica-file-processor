[time=0] The fact is God has made us different.
[time=7] In the Declaration of Independence, it reads that all men are created equal.
[time=13] What they meant was we are equal in our essence before God.
[time=17] No one person is more valuable to God than any other person regardless of what they look like.

[time=50] Learn to go beyond the surface and look at the contents to determine its worth and value.
[time=56] And the same thing holds true when it comes to people.
[time=60] Never judge them on their appearance.
[time=62] Today in our continued study of the book of James, we'll be taking a close look at what the Bible says about prejudice, discrimination, and partiality.
[time=71] Our special music today will be presented by Jenny Clancy.

[time=574] a chasing of the wind.

[time=637] and all his meaning all things fail as they begin and hearts defeat can only know
[time=658] a chasing of the wind, a chasing of the wind
[time=679] Why do we live without Jesus?
[time=689] Why do we waste another day?
[time=696] He is the life that sustains us, our only hope, our only way
[time=710] So tell me why do we live? Why do we live without Him?
[time=740] Why do we live without Jesus? Why do we live another day without Him? Thank you.
[time=756] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bibles and come with me to James chapter two
[time=762] and it's interesting that we come to this passage today in a lot of the fact that it's the fourth of July weekend really the founders of our country the writers of the Declaration of Independence
[time=775] might have taken the theme of that very document from this passage as you'll see it's going to develop for you but we're working our way through the book of James this morning chapter two verses one through thirteen and it's a little paragraph condemning favoritism or
[time=792] personal favoritism and maybe just to get our minds moving in the right direction I'll relate to you a story that is famous in our family the Moore family back in the mid 50s my dad
[time=802] was selling for Brunswick drug and so he had the privilege of calling on drug stores
[time=808] and his territory was the middle of Los Angeles as was his custom all through my childhood
[time=814] and those of my sisters he would take us to work with him he could get some time with us and talk to us and make us feel special well I wasn't born even then back in the mid 50s 1956 I think it's when this happened and he was taking my eldest sister Stephanie
[time=829] along she was about five or six and they were in a drug store there in the middle of Los Angeles and my dad was engaged in a conversation with the owner of that drug store a black man and trying to involve him and you know understanding new products and whatnot Stephanie not knowing
[time=845] what to do just kind of amused herself by looking in one of the displays and kind of
[time=851] lost herself and that well not too long later and a black man and his young daughter walk in the drug store the daughter was the same age approximately as Stephanie and as my dad
[time=862] tells it he and the drug store owner just kind of became distracted by my sisters queried
[time=869] look at this very very different looking little girl because we were raised in an area this
[time=875] was probably the first black child my sister had ever seen and so as my dad tells it Stephanie
[time=883] was just kind of looking at her and trying to figure her out and couldn't believe that it could be this way and in the full view of the drug store owner and the other father my sister Stephanie
[time=895] walked over to her and ventured to reach out and try to rub that stuff off and then looked at her
[time=904] hand to see if it worked potentially a very volatile situation I mean immediately we understand
[time=913] that the difference is noticed we notice when somebody's different than we are we also recognize
[time=921] that the exploration of that difference is potentially volatile there can be some connotations
[time=929] given when that actually that difference is explored as if to say oh what we're we're dirty something
[time=935] needs to be wiped off of us before we can be as clean as you are and in a soon to be hostile
[time=943] 60s the middle of LA exploded in the riots that we all know about the fact is this God has made
[time=951] us different vastly different in our appearances in our stature in our abilities in our IQs or
[time=959] the lack thereof in our talents in our aptitudes God has diversity and inequality that has been
[time=967] designed into the way that he has made us there's just no getting around it we do not all have
[time=973] the same IQ we do not all have the same athletic ability we do not all have the same ability
[time=979] to do certain tasks manual labor sort stuffs or artistic expression we are vastly different
[time=987] in the way that God has created us however it is true to say that we are all equal in our essence
[time=995] and we are all equally valued by God so says rightly the Declaration of Independence when it states
[time=1001] that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights
[time=1007] life liberty and happiness you have those rights of life liberty and happiness in our country
[time=1014] because the founders of our country believe that we were all equal in value and in essence
[time=1020] in the eyes of God but that's totally different than saying we are equal in every other respect
[time=1026] there is great inequality in the way that God has made us and the issue is what are we going to do
[time=1032] and how are we going to handle and how are we going to respond to the obvious differences that exist
[time=1038] as God has created us equal in essence and value to God equal in our sinfulness as we stand before
[time=1047] holy God equal in our need for salvation and a salvation which extends to all men but certainly not equal
[time=1054] in most other categories and the challenge that confronts this early Christian church and the challenge
[time=1064] which confronts us is what in the world are we going to do about those differences and how are we going
[time=1070] to handle them and how are we going to let them affect us positively or negatively and so that's
[time=1076] the issue that James wants to address in chapter 2 verses 1 through 13 and just to let you know where we're going in verse 1 he states a very clear principle do not hold your faith in personal
[time=1087] favoritism in verses 2 through 4 he illustrates that and if you were here last week James is in the
[time=1094] habit of providing his own illustrations remember the guy that looked in the mirror this makes for relatively easy preaching because the inspired author gives you his own illustration and we'll try to understand that illustration and then in verses 5 through 13 he'll give us four reasons why it
[time=1110] is inconsistent and inconceivable to hold favoritism in the same heart with faith in our glorious
[time=1118] Lord Jesus Christ okay let's look first of all at verse 1 the principle my brethren do not hold
[time=1126] your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism the word in the
[time=1133] Greek for favoritism is a compound noun and it means this receiving of face receiving of face
[time=1142] it means to receive by face or to accept or welcome on face value alone that same word was used
[time=1150] of judges in that culture unjust judges who before they would sentence a particular person or
[time=1157] execute a particular sentence upon one who had been convicted they would ask for a lifting of the face
[time=1164] they would ask for the opportunity to see the individual who they are now about to sentence and the unjust judge would do that by virtue of personal biases whereby he would give one sentence
[time=1175] to one person with a particular face and a different one with a different for the same crime
[time=1181] unjust advantage by virtue of appearance and God is saying do not treat people based upon their face
[time=1188] value the color of their skin whether or not they have a certain degree associated with their name the house they live in the car they drive the wardrobe they wear for God has said in 1 Samuel 16 7 that he looks on the heart it is we the human race that wants so desperately and so consistently
[time=1206] to look instead at the outward appearance so the principle is clear my brother in it is inconsistent
[time=1214] to hold in one hand your faith in the glorious Lord Jesus Christ and in the other hand your
[time=1220] personal favoritism now the illustration verses two through four for if a man comes into your
[time=1227] assembly with a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes and there also comes in a poor man in dirty clothes and you pay special attention to the one who is wearing the fine clothes and say you
[time=1237] sit here in a good place and you say to the poor man you stand over there or sit down by my footstool have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives this is the illustration of the near-sighted usher he's nowhere specifically named but he is near-sighted
[time=1254] because he looks only at the physical appearance let me try to make you or help you understand better
[time=1260] some of the nuances of this illustration the man who comes in first is the man with a gold ring
[time=1266] or literally translated gold finger it's the first or original gold finger I guess in this culture when
[time=1273] you wanted to show your wealth you would wear rings on your fingers expensive rings and if you had a lot of money it would not have been uncommon to have worn a ring on every one of your fingers except your thumbs and if you had a lot of money one of those fingers would be all gold you would
[time=1287] wear so many rings on that particular finger that it was truly a gold finger that's what he's saying
[time=1293] this man is lavishly dressed with a gold finger also he's dressed in fine clothes now whether it was
[time=1302] the cloth out of which this garment was made or the way it was embroidered and often in this age and still
[time=1308] in some parts of our culture this way today they would embroider expensive jewels into the garment
[time=1314] itself and so the garment would be worth far more than the cloth but the jewels that were embroidered
[time=1320] into it whether it was the colors that the garment was made of a lavish purple or some rich
[time=1328] loud color whatever it was it just reeked money so you have a person who is obviously well to do
[time=1335] another person comes he is a poor man in in the Greek a beggar he is a man who cannot make his own
[time=1343] way he is a man that in order to survive is so poor he begs to maintain his existence he comes in
[time=1349] with dirty clothes he would have had on just a basic normal Greek toga of sorts that you've seen
[time=1356] from time to time the problem is he only has one and he works in it and he sleeps in it and he sweats in it and it smells like it and it looks like it he is obviously one of the street people
[time=1367] of our culture nothing wrong with being either of those people unless character defects have brought
[time=1375] you to be poor and you are willing to work but some people are poor because they are poor and life has been difficult to them so there is nothing no value judgment here made about being rich or
[time=1387] about being poor or about being an usher keep in mind this is an illustration to draw a truth
[time=1394] into clear perspective he is not talking about rich people and he is not talking about poor people
[time=1400] and he is not talking about ushers he is talking about us and I say that to you as we move through
[time=1406] this discussion when you find your mind drifting to want to do a little theology on rich people or poor people stop that conversation in your head that is not what this text is about he wants it on you and your personal favoritism and the problems that you have with people who do not meet your
[time=1422] external standards so I say that as just a bit of help he has marked you verse three pay special
[time=1429] attention to him it's a marked man it's for preferential treatment you say to this this Mr. Goldfinger
[time=1436] you sit here in a good place we don't know exactly what that might have meant but certainly in any
[time=1442] gathering of people there are preferred seats there are seats that are better than others and so because
[time=1448] of his apparent wealth he is offered one of the good seats you say to the poor man you stand over
[time=1454] here rather you stand over there or sit down by my foot stool what that means the guy doing the
[time=1460] talking has not only a chair in which he can sit he has a foot stool on which to place his feet
[time=1466] and he is saying to the dirty poor man you can't have my chair and you can't have my foot stool
[time=1472] what you can have is the piece of floor next to it and if you don't like that then go over there
[time=1478] the point is I don't really care where you sit just sit and hurry up and sit so you don't bother
[time=1486] the rest of us that's the attitude I don't care if it's here there anywhere sit down get out of
[time=1494] sight and don't bother what we're trying to accomplish so it's a rather powerful illustration
[time=1504] now let me talk to you about the way I see this happening in America the most among Christians
[time=1510] for us poor man rich men against world standards we're also wealthy we can't stand it we do tend to
[time=1516] make some distinctions between wealth inside the United States of America and this kind of stuff does go on but let me try to draw you into something that may be even more relevant to your own life
[time=1526] something you may be getting to experience and it's fitting that we even talk about it on the 4th of July as it would confront a bit of our patriotism when I was living in Los Angeles
[time=1538] it became I became aware of the fact that there are over 200 primary languages in the Los Angeles
[time=1544] school district 200 primary languages that means the primary language is the native tongue of that
[time=1550] child there are over 200 different nationalities represented by the native tongues inside the
[time=1556] school districts of Los Angeles Los Angeles has a million Chinese people living there
[time=1562] Los Angeles is the second largest Spanish speaking city in the world second only to Mexico city
[time=1570] the same is true of the Korean population they're second only to Seoul it is becoming a cultural mosaic extraordinary people are moving there from all over the world
[time=1580] there is this great diversity of culture moving to Los Angeles and you know what the Christians are
[time=1586] doing they're moving out of Los Angeles because they don't like these foreigners they don't like
[time=1592] these people from the Middle East who own the gas stations and pump the gas and own the oil from which the gas comes they don't like the way they look and they don't like the way they talk and they don't like the fact that they can't understand them and they don't like the fact that they don't understand apple pie and softball and fords or Chevrolet whichever is your preference and when
[time=1612] those same people have the audacity to move into their neighborhood and into their city the white Christians get up and find another city they want nothing to do with these people because these people
[time=1624] do not honor understand their language their country their history and their traditions and
[time=1630] they feel rather justified in such a move now what was it that the Lord said to us in Matthew 28
[time=1638] well what does the great commission say to the to the Christian in fact it says this
[time=1646] go into all the what the nations of the world we all live under the mandate of going to the
[time=1655] nations of the world now here's the irony when because of political advantage economic advantage
[time=1661] the nations of the world have an opportunity to move to Los Angeles the Christians go good night
[time=1668] we're being invaded we got to leave favoritism absolute unadulterated favoritism
[time=1680] cloaked in a political self-righteousness cloaked in a patriotic self-righteousness that says this is my country and i don't like what
[time=1692] these people are doing to my country and to the economic status of my country and to the political
[time=1698] scenery of my country and god is saying good night would you please remember that you are citizens of
[time=1705] heaven and that you are but so journers on this planet and it shouldn't matter to you which country
[time=1711] you're in if i choose to sovereignly move the peoples of the world to the united states of america
[time=1717] would you please have half a heart and when they get there welcome them so that you can then lead
[time=1723] them to christ pretty in front of stuff pretty pretty wicked hearts we have pretty wicked hearts
[time=1732] i know so much about this because i struggle so deeply with it a fellow struggler do you realize
[time=1738] that america means absolutely nothing in comparison to bringing people to christ do you realize that
[time=1744] our culture is insignificant to god do you realize that the way we were raised and the language we
[time=1751] happen to speak and the food we happen to eat and the clothes we happen to wear and the suburbs we happen to live in is absolutely inconsequential to god when it comes to bringing people to christ
[time=1763] and he would hope and he would pray that while his son left the glories of his culture called the
[time=1769] perfection of eternity in the presence of the loving lord jesus christ an eternal face-to-face
[time=1775] fellowship to take the form of human flesh and move down here on this sin-soaked stinking planet
[time=1781] to reach us with christ having been so reached by the grace of god you would think he thinks we
[time=1787] would have a heart to reach somebody who looks a lot more like us than jesus ever did in the
[time=1793] condition of their heart and their soul and offer them the gospel but i think we've got a problem
[time=1800] with personal favoritism and i think when these people start moving to fort wane and you know
[time=1806] these trends it happens first in california and ten year later it happens here and it's starting
[time=1812] to happen here we are starting to say things like these people are invading our midwestern
[time=1819] conservative culture and we don't like this this is wrong what can we do about this
[time=1826] instead of saying my lands here comes the great commission to my front door praise god now what language did that guy speak and where can i find one of those dictionaries
[time=1838] that tells me his language and english what did he say he likes to eat i've never heard of that
[time=1845] could i try some where did you say you're from i'd love to know about your country
[time=1851] tell me about your past tell me about your tradition i would love to build some bridges
[time=1860] into your life whereby my own culture sacrificed even my own country sacrificed i could bring you
[time=1868] to christ let me give you four reasons why that ought to be our attitude
[time=1875] reason number one these come out of verses five and following the character of god the character of god demands that from us in verse five listen my beloved
[time=1888] brethren do did not god choose the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom
[time=1896] which he promised of those who love him but you have dishonored the poor man referring back to the
[time=1902] illustration think about the attributes of god for a minute you got the holiness of god you got
[time=1910] the justice of god you got the omnipotence the omniscience the immutability the eternality the love the grace the mercy the faithfulness the goodness of god listen to moses say it to you very clearly when moses is trying to distinguish god from all the other gods of the earth the
[time=1926] attribute he goes to is that god is not partial for the lord your god is the god of gods
[time=1934] and the lord of lords the great the mike the awesome god and now you expect him to say who created
[time=1942] the heavens and the earth right or who knows everything about everything or whatever but he says this
[time=1948] who does not show partiality nor take a bribe when moses is seeking to set god apart as the god
[time=1956] of gods the lord of lords the great the mighty the awesome god it's that he does not show partiality
[time=1962] he executes the text says justice for the orphan in the widow he shows his love for the alien by
[time=1970] giving him food and clothing there's the characteristic of god that sets him apart he does not see
[time=1977] superficial differences he looks at the heart and he cares about the heart and he's willing to die
[time=1983] for the heart so show your love for the alien the text says for you were aliens in the land of
[time=1992] egypt that's deuteronomy 10 verses 17 and 19 what an indictment
[time=1999] he says it in the new testament peter is absolutely out of his gourd trying to figure out how in the
[time=2008] world the salvation of jesus christ could possibly extend to the gentiles it's just inconceivable to
[time=2014] him that god has a heart for the gentiles after all that god had done with the nation of israel and of all the special privilege that was given to israel he has had a major partiality barrier to
[time=2025] get over trying to even conceive of the fact that god could care for the gentile enough to save them
[time=2031] and so god puts him through this like living situation that just just shatters all of his prejudices by having to go into the home of a man by the name of cornelius
[time=2042] and see that the spirit of god descends upon these gentiles and they get truly born again and he's just shaking in his soul and then he says this and peter opening his mouth said i most certainly understand now that god is not one to show partiality
[time=2058] but in every nation the man who fears him and does what is right is welcome to him
[time=2066] you see there's that concept of hospitality into the very heart of god that you saw in deuteronomy
[time=2072] he befriends him he gives him food spiritual food god doesn't care what he looks like
[time=2078] god doesn't care what he smells like god doesn't care that he doesn't understand somebody's particular national cultural historical stuff if you fear god and you want to do what is right
[time=2087] you're welcome in the heart of god then he goes on to preach this incredible statement the word
[time=2093] which he sent to the sons of israel preaching peace through jesus christ he is lord of all
[time=2101] you think lord of all he's sovereign overall not in this context he's saying that christ is willing to be the lord of every human being every color every race every people every tribe
[time=2113] every tongue every nation because god does not give a rip about the external stuff
[time=2119] it's just not in his vision it's just not in his eyesight it escapes him completely
[time=2127] what he sees is wounded hurting people that need salvation god doesn't have a favorite food god doesn't have a favorite nation not anymore he will restore israel
[time=2142] god doesn't have anything like that he just has people's hearts and souls on his mind first krentians 125 said not many wise according to the flesh not many mighty and not many noble
[time=2157] that's the church full of people not many wise according to the flesh not many mighty and not many noble you see god has chosen the poor and i don't mean to say remember now poor is the example being
[time=2169] given but it extends to any area of personal favoritism he's so committed to saving the lost
[time=2177] and among those the poor the outcast the unlovelies the unwanted that when he sent his own son to save
[time=2185] the world he sent his son as a poor man right absolutely broke didn't have a penny to his name
[time=2192] never did so you say what makes somebody somebody well how about your lineage who are you where you
[time=2198] from tell me about your family what's your history you know what christ was his lineage as as represented in matthew and luke is full of criminals sinful horrible wretched outcast
[time=2209] type people came our committed incest ray hab was a prostitute Ruth was idolatrous best shiba was an
[time=2215] adulterous jesus who are you are you somebody special yeah you want about my lineage i got an
[time=2221] adulter an incest person an idolatrous an adulter that's my that's my family line and proud of it
[time=2230] why because i came to seek and say that which is lost i want to identify with the lost i want
[time=2236] identify with the underprivileged i want to identify with the people who are full of sin the outcast secondly born in bethlehem but raised in nazareth nazareth was the poor manstown god
[time=2248] didn't even let his own son grow up on the right side of the tracks jesus grew up on the wrong side of the tracks from the despised nazareth and then as you know when he entered his public ministry he
[time=2259] was had had no official formal associations with the privileged of society he was constantly with
[time=2265] the publicans in the centers he was constantly with the poor constantly with the downcast and the outcast so from his lineage to the place in which he was raised to his public ministry
[time=2276] associations you've got to understand something about the heart of god he is committed to the underprivileged to the poor to the unlovely he is willing to associate with the ones that
[time=2290] nobody else is willing to associate with is the point and he has through history the second point the second point comes out of the end of verse six and part of verse seven
[time=2303] and it's this holding favoritism towards the rich is inconceivable with your faith in god because of the hostility of the rich
[time=2315] the hostility of the rich look at verse six is it not the rich who oppress you and personally drag you into court do they not blaspheme the fair name by which you have been called let me tell you what folks over the history of time the rich people in societies have not been
[time=2332] the friends of christians they have not been the ones who have used their power positions in society and in the legal system and in in the arena of the the power brokers of any given society
[time=2342] to use that in a benevolent way towards the faith they have instead carried characteristically through time used their positions of power to persecute the church it's just ridiculous why
[time=2354] would you then make a superficial judgment about somebody who walks into your assembly who looks rich and pays special attention to him when he happens to come from a class of people who through the centuries have been the ones most persecuting the church you see the danger you get in when you exercise favoritism you got to remember now the context of the early church even in chapter one
[time=2376] of james verse one they are dispersed abroad because of the persecution they were under heavy
[time=2382] persecution the wealthy christ rejecting jews of that day were all over these young fledgling
[time=2388] christians they had power they had wealth and they were dragging them into court and when they got them there in verse seven they blasphemed the name of christ why would you associate with
[time=2400] those people what is it about you that wants to gravitate towards that where are your loyalties
[time=2409] where is your your heart for the things of god the church was predominantly poor full of
[time=2416] common uneducated people remember acts chapter two they were so poor they couldn't even like survive and so the rich among them the few that were there that had money were willing to sell and disperse just to keep the church alive the first major conflict in the church was over trying
[time=2432] to supply widows with food a desperate situation financially impoverished how do we care for them throughout centuries if you'll think about it god has been saving more poor people than he has
[time=2443] rich people in fact it's very difficult to get saved if you're rich harder than the camel moving
[time=2449] through the eye of a needle but with god all things are possible and so we praise god that
[time=2455] some rich have been saved reason number three the requirements of the law this is interesting
[time=2464] look at verse eight if however you are fulfilling the royal law according to the scripture you
[time=2471] shall love your neighbor as yourself you are doing well he is saying this issue of favoritism strikes back to the central issue of the law remember in deuteronomy and then again in Matthew
[time=2482] 22 all the laws summed up and these two things that you love god and you love your neighbor he is saying an expression of loving your neighbor is that there is no personal favoritism because sometimes your neighbor doesn't look dress eat smell act like you do so you must be willing to
[time=2499] move beyond those facades to care for his heart even as Christ does and if you're doing that you're doing well and your obedience is back to the summing up of all the law of god to love your neighbor as yourself but verse nine this gets rather blunt if you show partiality and you are
[time=2516] committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors look don't try to weasel your way
[time=2523] out of this i mean he just narrows this thing down so tight no matter how you're cloaking your
[time=2529] partiality in whatever patriotic reasoning or garb you may have whatever fortressing mentality
[time=2536] you may have to protect yourself from the evils of the world whatever whatever rationale you're using to keep you from an unabashed love of the people who are in your world who are underprivileged
[time=2547] and unloved and different than you here it is in verse nine you're committing sin so he calls you to question the reasoning behind it and i do too i ask you even on this day
[time=2559] to think deeply and openly share with a friend a wife a husband what is it about you that is so
[time=2565] repulsed by people who are not native americans or native indianians or native whatever we are whatever it is that's different what is it about you that's so repulsed by that articulate it and
[time=2577] understand those are reasonings from hell not from the scriptures you are committing sin and are
[time=2584] convicted by the law as transgressors it doesn't get any clearer than that he goes on he goes further look at verse ten for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles
[time=2598] in one point he has become guilty of all the laws see here we are we want to say that wait a minute
[time=2605] i'm doing ten things right with god now these two one of which is partiality i don't do right
[time=2611] but i'm still okay with god and god is saying ten things right two things wrong bad relationship
[time=2619] with god you violate the law you can't you can't pick and choose what part of the law you're going
[time=2625] to obey and then obey the part you choose to obey and based on that say see i'm in good standing with god my relationship is right with god god says the law is a holistic reality and your relationship
[time=2636] with me is a holistic reality and if you are harboring partiality in your heart you are guilty of
[time=2642] breaking all the law because you assault the law in its integrity let me explain that to you it's
[time=2649] like the difference between a chicken pot pie and a frozen dinner okay you're frozen dinner your classic frozen dinner you got the peas over here you got the dessert over here you got those wonderful mashed potatoes on the side and a little meat down here at the bottom now here's how it works
[time=2665] you can have bad peas in a chicken pot pie excuse me in a frozen dinner and still be okay because it's in its own compartment and the bad stuff doesn't get into the other compartments and so you could just like throw that out and enjoy the rest of your frozen dinner you can't do that with a chicken pot pie you got bad peas in a chicken pot pie you got a bad chicken
[time=2686] pot pie because those bad peas see they infect everything else inside there and you got throw
[time=2692] the whole thing out he's saying don't think of your christian experience with god for a moment
[time=2699] like a frozen dinner don't think you can put your partiality over here and leave it there and let it fester and get real nasty and it doesn't affect the rest of your dinner the rest of your relationship with god no no no my friend you're a chicken pot pie those peas are right in the middle
[time=2715] of your heart and that wickedness and that lack of love and that partiality and that favoritism is affecting every dimension of your relationship with Jesus Christ and God the Father you got to confess it and get right he is saying you break a part of the law you break all the law
[time=2731] because it's a holistic venture in your relationship with god so he goes on looking verse 11 just to make it more clear for he who said do not commit
[time=2747] adultery that's a law also said do not commit a murder that's a different law there's the peas and there's the hash browns or the mashed potatoes now if you do not commit adultery
[time=2758] but you commit murder you have become a transgressor of the law he's not interested in the fact that
[time=2765] you haven't done adultery if you've done murder you've broken the law you violated your relationship with me you're not in good standing things are not right you are not healthy as a believer
[time=2776] and so he beckons with you to deal very very seriously and radically with this sin of personal
[time=2782] favoritism he says don't write this off on economic reasons on patriotic reasons on personal
[time=2790] reasons on the way you were raised on what they're doing to your society don't even begin to think
[time=2796] you can compartmentalize that sin and not have it affect your entire christianity you're lying to yourself i'm telling you it's pretty stiff little passage isn't it he just comes after us
[time=2808] more and more now watch it gets harder verse uh number four reason number four the nature of final judgment the nature of final judgment we can't hold our faith in personal
[time=2821] favoritism because of the nature of the final judgment what does that mean look at verses 12 and 13
[time=2831] so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty for judgment will be
[time=2838] merciless to the one who has shown no mercy and mercy triumphs over judgment let me give it to
[time=2844] you this way first how you treat the underprivileged the poor the the foreigner whatever your problem
[time=2852] is with your problem group and we all probably have our own little problem groups wherever your personal favoritism is if you are not consistently and regularly repenting of that and trying to
[time=2863] grow in that area if you give yourself to a life of partiality and you're just hard in your heart
[time=2870] and you don't give a rip what the preacher says or what the bible says about your particular area of personal favoritism there's a good question you may not be safe there's a good chance you may not
[time=2884] be born again there's a good chance you may just be a professor of christ and not a truly born
[time=2891] again believer look at it in verse 12 he's saying this so speak and so act as those who are to be
[time=2899] judged by the law of liberty what he's saying is there's going to come a day when you're going to stand before christ and he's going to be looking for the evidence that you have been set free by the law of liberty the power of grace and grace is the power inside of us by the regeneration of the
[time=2913] holy spirit and his continuing empowerment that allows us to move past these kinds of difficult natural barriers to other people in our life and if he doesn't see evidence that you've
[time=2923] been set free he concludes you haven't been set free it gets harder verse 13 for judgment will
[time=2931] be merciless to the one who has shown no mercy don't misunderstand this one christian when god
[time=2938] looks at your life if he does not see mercy coming out of your life to the needy people in your
[time=2945] world he will give you no mercy you say wait a minute what are you saying remember Matthew 10
[time=2953] Jesus said everyone who confesses me before man i will confess before my father who is in heaven you confess me here i will confess you in heaven he went on to say if however or but whoever denies
[time=2966] me before men i will also deny him before my father who is in heaven what's he saying truly
[time=2972] born again people confess Jesus Christ as their lord and savior truly born again people don't deny that Jesus Christ is their savior truly born again people say and no matter what the cost i
[time=2983] love Jesus Christ and if you're willing to do that here it's an obvious revelation that you're truly born again if you're not willing to do it here it is equally an obvious revelation that you are not truly born again and so when we both find ourselves in heaven if you did not give evidence
[time=2999] of your faith on earth i will not give evidence of a false faith in heaven i will not confess you
[time=3005] before my father remember what he said in Matthew chapter 18 the parable of the great rich man and
[time=3011] the slave who worked for him who owed him more than he could ever repay the poor slave had been embezzling from the king and there was no possibility of ever repaying the king and the king granted him total and conditional forgiveness for all the debt and then that forgiven slave went out and
[time=3028] ran across somebody who owed him a small fraction something that could be repaid and the forgiven
[time=3036] slave of that debt said pay me and pay me now he grabbed him around the throat and said pay me all
[time=3042] and the poor guy couldn't he said give me some time and the forgiven slave said no and he threw
[time=3048] him into prison you remember what Jesus said about that the parable finishes up
[time=3056] and the original king found out what the forgiven guy had done and threw him to the torturers until
[time=3063] he could repay all and by the way he could never repay all when he was being tortured which man he would be tortured the rest of his existence and then Jesus says this so shall my heavenly father
[time=3075] also do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart
[time=3082] here's the principle if you make a practice of holding grudges and you are
[time=3088] strongly resistant and calcified in your heart to forgiving people guess what it reveals that
[time=3095] you have never been forgiven and so god he says my heavenly father will turn you over to the
[time=3103] torturers for all eternity it's not losing your salvation it's just proving you never were truly saved so he brings that level of severity into the discussion of personal favoritism
[time=3116] verse 12 so speak and so act as those who are to be judged by the law of liberty you better give evidence that you've been born again and that you live in the law of liberty and that you can really love people who are different than you are and if you can extend mercy to them verse 13 for judgment
[time=3132] will be merciless to the one who has shown no mercy don't think for a minute you can live your whole life as a recluse fortress bigot against other people and show up in heaven and not be sent out
[time=3147] and not be judged don't expect that you can live a life without showing mercy and receive mercy from
[time=3155] god it's not a work salvation it's a product of true saving faith and if you're confused at all about that come back when we preach on these next verses 14 and following what uses it my brother and if a man says he has faith but he has no works can that faith save
[time=3172] him the answer is no let me wrap it up partiality is a struggle partiality comes so natural it's
[time=3183] like falling off a log partiality is just a part of what it means to be a fallen sinful human being
[time=3190] and you've got it and i've got it and it's sin it's absolutely sinful
[time=3198] and we need to repent and we need to repent little steps at a time but we need to be in the repent
[time=3206] business it might be fitting to tell you that just to put it on the positive foot my sister Stephanie
[time=3216] she's finishing final preparations to go to Russia to be a missionary see how is it that god can take a little girl in a drugstore who's trying to rub the stuff off
[time=3227] another girl who's different live through the 60s and the 70s and all the stuff that that meant and come to the place where she wants to give up her career and her family and the place she grew
[time=3238] up and all of those things to learn their language to live in their country and to tell them about
[time=3245] Jesus Christ that's what Jesus Christ does in people's lives you see that's the transforming
[time=3251] power of the spirit of god now don't misunderstand me it doesn't mean you have to become a missionary
[time=3258] and go to Russia it means that you have to allow the same god to transform your heart to reach out
[time=3264] in kindness and genuine love to the foreigner that's next door to the poor man that you don't want to be near to the ugly person that you don't want to associate with to the unlovely person that is the skating denunciation of your workplace you've got to have a heart to touch them right there that's what Christ wants from you be tender be gentle be so forgiven and so graced and so full of mercy
[time=3287] that you will be maligned by other people for your association with the unlovely secondly there ought to be one place for sure and i don't mean this in any derogatory way against
[time=3300] other churches but i'm talking to us there ought to be one place in the city of fort wane where the
[time=3306] unadvantaged come the disadvantaged come the underprivileged come and when they walk through the doors there isn't a hint of favoritism and it ought to be this church those very same people
[time=3319] who are poor and who are living off of welfare checks some of them because of a system and some of them because of their own sinful choices and some of them because it just didn't work out for them and they stand in line in those supermarkets and they have to produce their welfare checks again and they know what everybody's thinking oh yeah here you are again more welfare checks you can't pay for yourself and the guy feels like saying yeah that's right it's me i'm a loser i don't
[time=3342] fit i'm not making a living i'm on food stamps he ought to be able to come into this place and
[time=3349] feel none of that scorn and instead he ought to feel the warmth of christ in your handshake
[time=3356] and in your eyes and not just hi how are you happy sunday but could we have you to lunch today
