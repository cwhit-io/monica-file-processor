[time=60] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=76] Thank you for joining us. Today in Pastor Moore's absence, we'll have as our special speaker Robert Provost, Bob who's currently serving with Slavic Gospel Association will share with us what the Lord is doing in Russia.
[time=90] Our special musical guests today are the Birchfield brothers, Jonathan and Benji. Let's join them as we begin our service.
[time=120] (music playing)
[time=280] (applause)
[time=286] There's more to life than just living and dying. We're so thankful of that and when the Lord Jesus Christ rules in your life.
[time=296] That's when your life is more abundant and full. We come from Nashville, but our first home was in the Smoky Mountains of East Tennessee and we lived in a pretty humble little place.
[time=310] I had no running water or electricity, but our mother would do our laundry nearby in a creek and would burn wood and coal and still stove would huddle around in the winter and she would put us out in the yard to air out for the summers and we were very fortunate to be raised in a Christian home by Christian parents.
[time=330] I would love listening to Mother Play piano. She played classical music, which is unusual there in the Smokies, but I loved hearing that. I loved a variety of music and she had this one piece she always played called Clarity Loon from France and I would just listen to this beautiful piece and then she would turn around and play a beautiful gospel or a hymn and sometimes she'd put them together
[time=360] We'd like to do that. This is Clarity Loon with no one ever cared for me like Jesus.
[time=390] [MUSIC - 216 seconds]
[time=612] [APPLAUSE]
[time=618] [MUSIC - 174 seconds]
[time=802] Many years ago, our family took a summer vacation. All seven of us piled into an old beige colored station wagon and I'll rest it out in the back if I remember right.
[time=818] And we brought our eighth member, which is our little hound dog. Five kids, our parents, our dog, and we set off to see the world.
[time=828] We were going to see the Tetons, the Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and spend several months doing it.
[time=836] We knew that there'd be a lot of time where we'd be crossing deserts and taking hours of doing nothing but riding, so we each needed to bring a project.
[time=848] So, I brought a little box guitar, I paid about $12 for it, and that's where I first learned to start strumming chords.
[time=856] And I learned two chords that summer, an E minor and an A minor, and I strummed those two chords for the rest of that summer, back and forth.
[time=870] In the car and in the campfire at night, I'd sit around and strum them again, and I was very familiar with them by the end of the summer, and I found out they did make a song, an old spiritual.
[time=884] Our family was real tired of that song, but I still like it.
[time=896] Benj brought some Quaker oatmeal cans and some pencils and made a little drum set, banged on those in the far back of the cars, we could get him.
[time=908] And our brother, Mark, he had a piece of paper and a notepad and a pencil, and he would draw people's portraits as they would pass us in their cars, and then he'd try to sell it to them at the rest stops up ahead.
[time=924] And our little dog, Bugle, she had ten puppies on this trip, so she had a project of her own, and so it's 18 of us now in this old station wagon.
[time=940] But it's a great summer, and that song, Wayfaring Stranger, is the first song I learned on guitar.
[time=950] It has a powerful message, we're just passing through.
[time=954] Our home is being prepared for us, where we'll live forever and ever.
[time=958] Wayfaring Stranger.
[time=970] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=1180] If I were to take my testimony and sum it up into one song, it would have to be this one.
[time=1188] Jesus is the sweetest name I know.
[time=1192] It's a personal testimony, means a lot to me, and I love to play this song because it's my way through instrumental music to express my love for the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1204] He indeed is the sweetest name I know.
[time=1208] [MUSIC - 198 seconds]
[time=1416] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1432] It's your heart full of praise to overflowing.
[time=1436] God has used you men in a great way and we thank you.
[time=1442] Jesus is the sweetest name I know.
[time=1446] You know a sweeter name?
[time=1450] When you know his name, you have life.
[time=1456] When you really know his name, when you have him, when you have the son, you have life eternal, the sweetest name we have ever heard.
[time=1468] When you have that name, that man, our God in your life, you have love, he is love.
[time=1478] You have peace, there's no other way to have that peace, there's no other way to have that love, and you have joy, unspeakable joy.
[time=1492] You have the potential of families that gather around the name of Jesus, families that with children growing up with blessing.
[time=1502] You have life eternal, you have forgiveness.
[time=1508] You have the giver of every good and perfect gift, and you have them as your best friend.
[time=1516] Even the prophet Isaiah, while he was looking ahead several thousand years, the prophet Isaiah knew the name of Jesus.
[time=1528] He knew the character of Jesus. He knew that he would be coming.
[time=1534] He writes, inspired by the Holy Spirit in chapter 52 of the book of Isaiah.
[time=1540] Would you please turn there with me this morning?
[time=1546] Don't you love the word of God?
[time=1548] The older I get, and the more I read it, the more I love it.
[time=1554] I don't know how I could love it more, but it just seems to be more and more.
[time=1558] To have this book, and how many do you have?
[time=1564] It has all the answers.
[time=1566] If there's an important question, there's an important answer, and the important answers are all right here in this book, given freely to us.
[time=1576] In this passage, as in much of the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah, skips around a little bit. He'll make a statement that is looking ahead several thousand years, and then he'll make a statement that is looking ahead even beyond that.
[time=1594] And then he'll make a statement that's looking back a few hundred years, and somehow the spirit of God weaves all that together in this phenomenal book called Isaiah.
[time=1604] Beginning in verse 13, the prophet Isaiah, speaking from God, and the words of God, says, "Behold, my servant will prosper."
[time=1622] And it's God the Father, through the pen of Isaiah, talking about Jesus, the sweetest name we know.
[time=1630] And when he talks about him prospering, he's looking past the cross, he's looking past even the resurrection.
[time=1640] He's looking ahead to the return of Christ when he will reign in glory, when every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord.
[time=1650] And he says, "He will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted, Lord of Lords and King of Kings, none like him."
[time=1660] And then he goes, speaks directly to the people of Judah at that time.
[time=1666] And he makes a comparison in suffering, and he speaks to them referring to their Babylonian captivity, where they suffered greatly as a nation under judgment for their sin.
[time=1682] And he says, "Just as many were astonished at you, my people, many were astonished at the great suffering of God's people as they suffered in punishment for their sin."
[time=1696] And then he gives contrast and talks about the suffering of the Lord Jesus, who would pay the price for those sins that Judah had been punished for.
[time=1712] For the sins of their time of Isaiah's time, for the sins of all time, up until this moment for your sins and mine.
[time=1722] Friends, this is the big picture. This is the big picture in the universe.
[time=1726] What we're covering together this morning in the Word of God is as big as it gets.
[time=1730] You want to know what's important, it's right here in a few verses, right here.
[time=1736] And to the degree that your life and my life is tied to this big picture, we will know the blessing of God.
[time=1746] Whereas our lives are tied in obedience to this big picture, and as we live out what God would have us do, we're living out why God has you and me on this planet, why he gives us breath every day, it's right here.
[time=1758] And as we in obedience live that out, we will know blessing upon blessing upon blessing beyond our imaginations, the comparison that he makes in suffering.
[time=1774] So his appearance was marred more than any man. His face was distorted. The soldiers took thorn branches, are you familiar with thorn branches?
[time=1790] Now sharp, they are sometimes that long, like sewing needles, and they took those thorn branches filled with those thorns, and they just twisted them into a circle.
[time=1802] We'd call it a wreath today. They called it a crown because they were mocking him.
[time=1808] They were calling him the king of the Jews and pointing fun at him, and they took that and they mashed it down over his head.
[time=1816] Can you imagine those thorns cutting into his skin and into his scalp, and blood would have been flowing freely in every direction, down across his face, down across his back?
[time=1830] And then the gospel report says that the soldiers punched him in the face repeatedly, and then they set him up as a king, and they put on a purple robe, and they took a reed, and they stuck it in his hand, pretending that it was a scepter, which he would rule with as a king.
[time=1854] And then they took the reed out of his hand, and they beat him on the head with it, and they spitted him, and they bowed before him, and they mocked him, the creator of the universe, the son of God, in your place, and in my place.
[time=1878] They took him to Golgotha, and they hung him on that cross.
[time=1888] Isaiah says his appearance was marred more than any man's appearance had ever been marred.
[time=1896] And then he says in his form more than the sons of men, his body was destroyed more than had ever happened.
[time=1906] They drove those nails in his hands.
[time=1910] Can you imagine a nail through your hand?
[time=1912] Ever hit your thumb with a hammer?
[time=1914] That's nothing.
[time=1916] And how about some nails not through your feet?
[time=1922] And then to hang him on that cross for the cruelest death that has known the mankind, even up to this moment.
[time=1932] And then even after he had died and the spirited left him, the soldiers would drive a sword into his side to make sure that he was dead.
[time=1944] His form devastated more than the sons of men.
[time=1950] What was he doing?
[time=1956] By his blood he was purchasing your life and my life eternal.
[time=1962] He was paying the redemption.
[time=1964] He was paying for your sins and my sins, for the sins of Judah, for the sins beginning with Adam, up until this moment,
[time=1972] and on into the future for every sin, for the sacrifice of the Son of God is sufficient.
[time=1982] It's sufficient to pay.
[time=1982] That's how big he is in God's plan and program.
[time=1986] God, God the Son, it took to die and suffer in your place and in mine.
[time=1994] That's the biggest news ever known on planet earth and throughout the universe.
[time=2002] And he was purchasing not only by his blood your life eternal, your soul, your reservation in heaven,
[time=2012] but he was doing it for people of every tongue, every tribe, every nation, every people who would ever live.
[time=2024] And then we go back for a moment here with me to Revelation in Chapter 5.
[time=2034] Revelation in Chapter 5, Isaiah tells us, and we'll come back to Isaiah in a moment.
[time=2040] Isaiah tells us what's going to happen in our lifetimes.
[time=2048] And then the Apostle John through his experience recorded in the book of Revelation tells us what's going to happen in the future after this life is over.
[time=2062] I want to read with you.
[time=2064] Ask the Lord to help you imagine and be transported here.
[time=2068] This is what's going to be like in the future.
[time=2074] In the long range future, our lives are just beginning here on planet earth.
[time=2080] Most of our lives are going to be spent in heaven.
[time=2084] We'll be there forever.
[time=2086] The Apostle John had this experience.
[time=2090] And he says, "And I saw in the right hand of him, God the Father, who sat on the throne."
[time=2098] I mean, he's there seeing God sitting on the throne. We're going to be there and we're going to see God sit on the throne.
[time=2104] Can you imagine that?
[time=2106] That's reality.
[time=2108] If you have, by faith, received Christ as your Savior, you're going to be there.
[time=2112] You're going to see God sit on the throne.
[time=2116] And he saw that he had a book written inside and on the back and it was sealed up with seven seals.
[time=2122] God was holding this book in his right hand.
[time=2126] And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and to break its seals?"
[time=2132] Listen, I witness.
[time=2136] I witness a count.
[time=2138] And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.
[time=2144] It's just that kind of book.
[time=2148] It's a book beyond our ability to comprehend.
[time=2154] And John says, "I began to weep greatly because no one was fond worthy to open the book or to even look into it."
[time=2162] And one of the elders said to me, "Stop weeping.
[time=2166] Behold the lion that is from the tribe of Judah, Jesus.
[time=2172] The root of David has overcome so as to open the book and it's seven seals.
[time=2178] Where did he overcome? He overcame on that cross."
[time=2188] And I saw between the throne with the four living creatures, between the throne and the elders, a lamb standing.
[time=2196] That's Jesus.
[time=2198] As if slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.
[time=2208] And he came. Jesus came.
[time=2210] And he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne. He could take it right out of the hand of God.
[time=2216] How? He is God also.
[time=2220] And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty four elders fell down before the lamb.
[time=2230] As we will fall upon our faces when first we come into his presence.
[time=2236] Having each one harp and golden balls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints, your prayers and my prayers are going to be there right there.
[time=2248] How do we understand that? I don't know. God's ways are higher than our ways.
[time=2254] But if it says they're going to be there, they're going to be there. Our prayers are going to be there.
[time=2262] And they sang a new song saying, "Worthy are thou to take the book and to break its seals for thou was slain."
[time=2270] Jesus and did his purchase for God. Here it is with thy blood, men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.
[time=2284] Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzkistan, all the rest.
[time=2294] In central Europe, even Albania, where every church was closed and where four years ago as I stand here today, there was not one believer in that whole country.
[time=2308] They're going to be there. Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia, India, China, every nation.
[time=2322] Not only every nation of our time, but every nation of history, every nation of future.
[time=2330] And he continues, "And thou hast made them to be a kingdom." We're in that kingdom.
[time=2336] We're in that kingdom with people from every tribe and every nation, every people, every tongue and how wonderful it is sometimes to have a privilege of being in meetings.
[time=2344] When there are people there from many different countries who love the Lord and you can't even speak the same language.
[time=2350] But there's such a bond as our sovereign God of love, the rural supreme and the hearts of men, no matter where they were born or what language they speak or what kind of culture or what they eat.
[time=2362] The spirit of God through the blood of the Lamb has made them together into one.
[time=2370] A kingdom, we call it the church, we call it the church and Jesus said that he would build his church and not even the gates of hell would be able to stand against it.
[time=2382] And in our lifetime we've seen that. We've seen that in Albania where just four years ago it was a prison sentence to have a copy of the Word of God and be caught with it seven years.
[time=2396] And then it would be extended over and over again for a lifetime for the grave sin of owning the Word of God.
[time=2402] And today church is being planted. Some of you have met our eldest son, Rob, when he's been here.
[time=2408] He's involved now in planting a church in the capital city and we'll talk about that tonight.
[time=2414] But this kingdom called the church and priests to our God and they'll reign upon the earth in the future.
[time=2418] And I looked and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders.
[time=2424] And the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands and they were saying with a lot of voice worthy as the Lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.
[time=2438] And every created thing which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea and all things in them I heard saying to him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb.
[time=2448] Jesus be blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever.
[time=2454] And the four living creatures kept saying amen and the elders spelled down and they worshiped.
[time=2464] We're going to be there.
[time=2466] Now back to Isaiah please. Isaiah 52.
[time=2476] Isaiah writes that Jesus will sprinkle many nations.
[time=2478] He says thus he will sprinkle many nations.
[time=2480] He will be a blessing to many many nations.
[time=2482] In fact we now see in the book of Revelation and other places that he will be that blessing to every nation.
[time=2490] And then in the next verse it comes right up to an historical application of these days in which we live.
[time=2498] He says kings will shut their mouths on account of him just a few short years ago.
[time=2504] We saw that Iron Curtain come down virtually overnight.
[time=2508] And those atheistic kings had their mouths shut right now.
[time=2512] Right now nobody saw it coming.
[time=2514] Even our CIA had to have been sleeping because God I believe blinded.
[time=2520] See we see in the book of Acts in chapter one that when God is going to put in place a new era, a new epoch, a new world order.
[time=2532] There's going to be no advance notice so everybody will know that God did it and God did it.
[time=2536] God did it.
[time=2540] And we've seen that happen and even more literally.
[time=2542] I mentioned Albania.
[time=2544] There was a great and powerful radio transmitter transmitting under the name Radio Tirana.
[time=2554] The most atheistic anti-Christ radio programming in all of history was broadcasting powerfully around the world from Tirana, Albania.
[time=2568] And as we gather here this morning going throughout through that great transmitter today is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2578] And in Erkutsk Russia over near Lake Baikal two thirds of the way across Siberia.
[time=2584] Another great and powerful transmitter used for decades by Radio Moscow to send atheistic anti-Christ programming done into China and India.
[time=2596] As we gather here this morning through that great transmitter goes the gospel of Jesus Christ into China into India.
[time=2606] Literally we have seen kings have their mouths shut on account of him.
[time=2612] And then Isaiah is a little more specific and he says for what had not been told them they will see.
[time=2618] They were not told. They were told there is no God.
[time=2622] They were told there is no God. In fact they were told that the only place to find hope for the future is in the Communist Party.
[time=2628] And they were told it from age one month I suppose or one day if they were able to understand and no one knows when a child first begins to get a glimpse of understanding some of these things.
[time=2644] But for all their lives they were told there is no God. There is no God and only a forward believe there is a God.
[time=2652] I remember my wife and I were reminiscing this morning remember being this is probably four years ago we are in a place called Novgorod Russia.
[time=2662] And we were doing street evangelism we had a singing group there from the Masters College.
[time=2668] And we were singing and we were preaching. And in the crowd afterwards a frail little woman made her way up to me into Luetta.
[time=2686] And she asked if she could have a brochure from the Word of God.
[time=2692] And as we handed it to her she had a big smile and a big look of hope upon her face.
[time=2698] And I said to her ma'am please forgive my question but how many years have you waited to receive something from the Word of God?
[time=2710] She said I'm 93.
[time=2716] Then it was about a year and a half ago we were in a city in the Ukraine I may have told you about this before.
[time=2722] It's a city where they make the nuclear submarines. It's a city where earlier Luetta and I were the first foreigners ever in the city.
[time=2730] They'd ask us to come and do an evangelistic crusade which I usually sort of avoid doing because I would rather in my ministry focus on helping the Christians learn how to share their faith
[time=2744] and go out and reach the people they work with and go to school with and live next to.
[time=2748] But a pastor persisted and we went and it was a crusade in a football stadium there and at the end we gave an invitation.
[time=2758] And somewhere around 3,000 people came to repent of their sins and put their trust in Christ.
[time=2764] And I'll never forget as I stood in the middle and led them in a sinner's prayer said amen, looked over and there was a tall older woman there but over by where that guitar is.
[time=2778] And she's trying to get my attention and I looked over and she said I just wanted you to know that what you said tonight I never heard before tonight.
[time=2786] Never heard before and she had to be 70, 75, waiting a lifetime to hear and what they had not heard they will understand Isaiah says.
[time=2798] There's a quality that these people have. A quality that can only be described as a preparation of the heart and mind by the Spirit of God.
[time=2812] About one out of every 1,000 people is a born again Christian. If you take all the former communist countries together, one out of 1,000.
[time=2820] If every one of them were a missionary they couldn't begin to get the gospel to the other 990 some that are trying to get saved.
[time=2832] It is amazing on this most recent trip.
[time=2834] I tried a lot of things that I hadn't done for a couple of years to just sort of sample and see if the spiritual interest was just as strong as it was when we first started going over.
[time=2846] I got on the airplane to fly to Corovatia Pietzk and Moscow and decided I would give scripture literature to everybody on the airplane and every single person again, every single person gladly received it.
[time=2862] The ladies who were knitting put down their knitting needles, the men who were reading a newspaper put down their paper, the ladies who were reading novels put them down.
[time=2870] As soon as they saw it was from the Word of God they grabbed it and started to read it.
[time=2874] And as we went down that bumpy runway in that old Russian airplane, I had great comfort in my heart.
[time=2882] Great comfort in my heart because we were involved in doing what Christ has asked us to do, involved in what he commanded us to do in the Great Commission.
[time=2894] And at the end of that Matthew 28 passage he says when you're about the business of going and making disciples of the nations and baptizing them and teaching them he says I will be with you always.
[time=2908] And that's in the context, it's a special being with us, being with him, it's special to that.
[time=2914] Now he's with us forever from the moment of salvation, we know that.
[time=2920] But when he tells us that it's our job and our opportunity, our phenomenal opportunity to get to take the gospel to those who have never heard.
[time=2932] And now for the first time they get a chance to do that.
[time=2936] And your church here has been involved in a major way.
[time=2940] Tonight I'm going to focus on churches that your church has been helping.
[time=2946] And I can't wait to tell you in the first service, in the first service I talked about a city called Vinica, half a million people, one church, and you've been helping them build a building.
[time=2958] And they moved from their old sanctuary which squeezed in around 350 people with probably a hundred of those standing.
[time=2968] And their last Sunday morning there was the last Sunday in April.
[time=2972] And the next Sunday was Easter this year, the first Sunday in May.
[time=2976] And they moved into their new building and many said they were building a building much too large.
[time=2982] You see they had the vision, God had given them the vision and the faith, they had no money, only vision and faith to set out, to build a sanctuary that would seat 2,500.
[time=2994] And in their first service, building not even completely finished yet, there were more than 3,500, still they had a thousand people standing.
[time=3002] They gave an invitation for people to repent of their sins and put their trust in Christ Jesus as Savior and Lord, and more than 150 people came.
[time=3012] Two doctors of science, several medical doctors and many teachers, in fact they said that the majority of the 150 were professional people.
[time=3022] The people who had to have been members of the Communist Party to have their job.
[time=3028] God is pouring out his spirit in those nations in these days.
[time=3032] You see it's almost a half a billion people in Russia and what we call the commonwealth of independent states today, formerly Soviet Union and Central Europe together.
[time=3044] It's about a half a billion, 500 million people and it's very difficult to find someone who doesn't want to be witnessed to and there's no one to tell them.
[time=3054] But your church is helping, not only that, but several other churches.
[time=3058] And I brought pictures, I didn't have video and we've asked your video staff, we're hopeful they may be able to present those this evening so you can see these churches and what's happened and what is continuing to happen.
[time=3072] Two smaller churches that we visited that you have just recently helped begin their buildings, phenomenal stories.
[time=3078] I mean a church that has I think 30 or 40 people.
[time=3082] I'll say accurately tonight maybe it's 52 they now have I can't recall.
[time=3088] But they don't have building yet.
[time=3090] They do have a building site because they'd won the favor of all the peoples that sound like the book of Acts because they'd won the favor of the government and their town.
[time=3098] They gave them a building site in the middle of the Central Park.
[time=3102] And as we went to look at the building site instead of pulling out a plot plan or an architectural scheme of the building, the pastor brought out a map.
[time=3112] A map because he wanted to show us starting from that little church in that town.
[time=3118] He wanted to show us the lines going on to the six or seven other churches that they're planting at the same time.
[time=3124] But they can't do without our help. See the average salary for example in the Ukraine today is twenty dollars per month.
[time=3134] And a basket, a small basket of groceries cost thirty dollars.
[time=3140] People on pension on retirement receive five to ten dollars a month which means they can only get a third of a basket of groceries.
[time=3148] People are almost literally starving.
[time=3150] If you happen to be one of the few who has a car, it would take you two months pay to fill up your little Russian car with gas one time.
[time=3160] These are people in despair except for the Christians.
[time=3164] The Christians are overflowing with hope because these are the days they prayed for.
[time=3168] These are the days that you and I prayed for.
[time=3170] And God is pouring out a spirit but there aren't enough of them to reach their land.
[time=3176] So we're involved in training pastors, we're involved in literature, we're involved in sponsoring national missionaries.
[time=3182] You can sponsor a national missionary in Russia for a hundred fifty dollars a month.
[time=3188] I mean that even pays for renting the building so he can plant the first church in a city.
[time=3194] There are tens of thousands of cities that don't have any church.
[time=3198] And if you go and walk through those cities which I've done many many times all across Siberia, you walk in the streets and you encounter people and I like to interview them.
[time=3208] And you just start to talk with them and say are you a believer?
[time=3212] And they'll almost always say no but they'll smile and then they'll almost always say but we need a church here.
[time=3218] I'm not a believer but we need a church here.
[time=3220] Could you help us get a church going here?
[time=3224] We need a church for our children.
[time=3224] It's too late for me but we need a church for the children.
[time=3228] And many places where there are churches that have Sunday schools there are waiting lists for children of non-believers because they can't get them in.
[time=3236] And they don't have a building big enough for a Sunday school.
[time=3238] We're just in a church two weeks ago that has Sunday school classes all day long Sunday.
[time=3242] They only have two or three rooms but they have six hundred children.
[time=3246] They have to schedule them all day long to get them all in.
[time=3248] They have the opportunities, unbelievable opportunities and we have the resources.
[time=3254] And the word of God tells us why we have the resources.
[time=3258] It tells us right in Psalm 67, no need to turn there.
[time=3264] It tells us why He's blessed us.
[time=3268] He says the earth has yielded its produce.
[time=3270] Nowhere has the earth yielded produce and blessing as it has in America.
[time=3276] God our God blesses us.
[time=3280] God blesses us.
[time=3280] Here's why.
[time=3282] Here's why you make several thousand dollars a month and they make twenty dollars a month.
[time=3290] They have the opportunities.
[time=3292] We have the resources.
[time=3292] Listen.
[time=3294] God blesses us.
[time=3296] That all the ends of the earth may fear Him.
[time=3300] He's given us riches.
[time=3302] Not just to enjoy.
[time=3304] That's fine to enjoy.
[time=3306] But the main reason He's given us the riches is so they can be used to finance the advancement of the kingdom of God.
[time=3312] The kingdom of God in every nation.
[time=3316] With every people.
[time=3318] Every tongue.
[time=3322] Time is gone.
[time=3326] But I want to give opportunity as we close our time together today.
[time=3332] The wetter and I remember a time when we rented and went.
[time=3340] We rented church service very similar to this.
[time=3342] Beautiful church with beautiful music.
[time=3346] Church committed to the word of God.
[time=3350] And the pastor at the end of his service asked this question.
[time=3356] He said are you ready to do anything?
[time=3358] Go anywhere for God.
[time=3362] Are you ready to do anything and go anywhere?
[time=3364] Have you grown in your spiritual life to that point where you can completely let go of your life and say, I'm ready.
[time=3370] I'll even go to Russia.
[time=3370] I'll go to Siberia.
[time=3372] I'll go to Albania.
[time=3374] I'll go to Macedonia.
[time=3374] I'll go to Serbia.
[time=3376] I'll go to Herzegovina.
[time=3378] I'll go anywhere because I love Jesus, the sweetest name I've ever heard.
[time=3386] And I want to be obedient to Him.
[time=3388] And for most of us that doesn't mean going.
[time=3390] It just means being willing to go.
[time=3392] And we're at that point where we'll just abandon the desires of self and turn our lives fully over to the Lord.
[time=3398] And just say, Lord, I'll do whatever.
[time=3400] I'll go anywhere.
[time=3402] At that point God can really begin to use us here in this community.
[time=3408] Across Indiana, across America, across the world, whatever He has.
[time=3412] He has a different plan for each of our lives.
[time=3416] So we're going to sing a great hymn called Only Trust Him.
[time=3422] Only Trust Him.
[time=3424] And there may be some here today who are like those Russian people.
[time=3426] And God is drawing you to Himself.
[time=3430] But at this point you have never yet asked Him to forgive you of your sins and to save your soul.
[time=3440] You haven't asked Him to come and live in your heart.
[time=3442] You haven't said, Jesus, I believe that you have died for my sins and I trust you.
[time=3448] I will trust only you.
[time=3452] And we would invite you as we, in a moment, we sing this song together.
[time=3458] We would invite you to come and I would meet you in front.
[time=3460] And there may be other needs and other reasons that you would come.
[time=3462] And we have elders and deacons who would be happy to pray with you and to encourage you this morning.
[time=3470] So as our brother comes to lead us in singing, God bless you.
