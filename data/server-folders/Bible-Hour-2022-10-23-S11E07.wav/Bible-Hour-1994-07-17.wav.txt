[time=13] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=20] Thank you for joining us.
[time=22] Today, as Pastor Moore is on vacation, we're pleased to have Dr. Ronald Powell as our guest speaker.
[time=27] Dr. Powell is the Director of the newly inaugurated Department of Criminal Justice at Taylor University, Fort Wayne.
[time=33] Before coming to Taylor, he was Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Corrections, where he served into three governors.
[time=40] Previously, he was Deputy Commissioner of Corrections in Georgia.
[time=43] His introduction to criminal justice began as a Christian volunteer in southern prisons.
[time=49] Having felt a calling to Christian public service, he completed his graduate education and then moved into his professional service career.
[time=56] We're sure you'll appreciate his message today.
[time=59] Our special music today will be presented by Susan Stump.
[time=64] Let's join our Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=69] [MUSIC - 206 seconds]
[time=290] Dad had a way of producing music in our home, a little bit different than Mother.
[time=297] Mother loved the classics.
[time=299] Dad loved the barn burners and the old hold down kind of pieces.
[time=304] He played fiddle banjo and guitar.
[time=306] He's the first guitarist I ever heard.
[time=308] And Riley would sit around and play these instruments while all the old timers from the mountains would come down and play instruments for hours.
[time=315] Just play music and song after song.
[time=319] This is a little medley of some of those old tunes we would do and we would sing them as us children.
[time=326] We would sing this old home mission church that our father built.
[time=331] And we had a great time and learned these and they really mean a lot to us.
[time=336] These are very special old tunes.
[time=339] This is called the Gospel Medley, starting with a little brown church in the wild wood, ending with all fly away.
[time=346] [MUSIC - 439 seconds]
[time=795] [MUSIC] Love never seemed like [MUSIC] Love never seemed like before me [MUSIC]
[time=820] [MUSIC]
[time=832] [APPLAUSE - 5 seconds]
[time=841] I'm very thankful to the Holy Spirit as He brings the music together and the message.
[time=845] We have a guest speaker today in preparing some of the music a couple weeks ago just thinking about a theme talking about our determination to serve the Lord and to realize and to experience the love that though we can experience it from our family and friends there's nothing like the love of our Lord Jesus Christ. I think you're going to see how all that ties in as we listen to our message today.
[time=869] Our guest speaker is Dr. Ronald Powell from Taylor University in Fort Wayne.
[time=873] We've had the privilege of meeting a number of professors from that school and also some students who have been attending our church and everything has been good and we appreciate that. He's a member of the social science department at Taylor University and directs the criminal criminal justice department there and prior to coming to Fort Wayne he's been in leadership in criminal organizations in Georgia and in New Hampshire and I listen to that message in the first service and I want you to listen intently to what he has to say it's very very critical for the day and age in which we live and for the style of leadership that we could give to our community if we'll commit to the Lord Jesus Christ and his saving power. Would you please give a warm welcome to Dr. Ronald Powell.
[time=925] [APPLAUSE - 8 seconds]
[time=937] It might be down the street at Hall's Diner.
[time=941] It could even be outside in the parking lot today.
[time=945] Or perhaps on the Larry King radio talk show late at night.
[time=949] It could be really any number of places where a conversation is taking place. A conversation about crime and violence and law and order. And like most other dialogues about this subject this one is no exception it's spirited, it's animated, voices are raised, the participants are gesturing with emphasis, emotions are running high.
[time=973] If we could eavesdrop, if we could listen in on one of these conversations about crime and violence we might hear things like I just don't feel safe anymore. I don't even drive down to the corner pharmacy without locking the doors on my car and looking in the rear view mirror.
[time=989] Another participant might say well the problem is the justice system is just a big joke.
[time=997] They keep committing crimes because they know nothing's going to happen to them. They'll get away with it.
[time=1005] Perhaps one of the participants will say something like this man said.
[time=1009] His newspaper ran an editorial saying they needed to improve prison conditions. And he didn't like that idea.
[time=1017] So he wrote the editor and this is what he said. Dear editor after reading your article "improving prisons" I was ready to suggest that we purchase the country club to house the little darlings so that life would be comfy and pleasant.
[time=1033] You're laughing because some of you think this way. If I didn't know better I would have thought that a country club atmosphere is the answer to rehabilitate the quote "crut of society." I'm sure you wouldn't feel that way. Another thing, get the state's electric chair warmed up. You'll be shocked at the decrease in crime in our state. Signed Frank Pazola.
[time=1057] No one is passive or neutral when he comes to the subject of violence in society.
[time=1065] I suppose many people do agree with Mr. Pazola who wrote this letter to the editor. They have what I call a low TQ.
[time=1073] Low tolerance quotient.
[time=1077] They're intolerant of crime and violence as we all are but they're also intolerant of the opinions of other people about the subject.
[time=1085] I think we all have strong opinions about it as hard as we are about hearing about the juice O.J. Simpson. Listen, we're obsessed with the drama with the details of the people versus O.J. Simpson.
[time=1101] Why are we so titillated and mesmerized by this subject of violence in America?
[time=1109] I'll mention three reasons I think there are many.
[time=1113] First of all, because we know there's a strong probability, a likelihood that we ourselves individually will be the victims of a crime.
[time=1121] Very likely and in a sanctuary and in a congregation this large, there are many victims.
[time=1129] Some of you have been victimized multiple occasions. Crime strikes close to home. That's why we're preoccupied with it.
[time=1137] Did you know that there are 35 million victimizations in this country every year? Some years as high as 40 million?
[time=1145] You're more likely to be the victim of a crime today than you are to have a traffic accident on the way home.
[time=1153] But we're most concerned about how likely is it that I will be the victim of a violent crime. That's what we fear most.
[time=1161] There were 32 homicides in Fort Wayne last year. It was an all-time record.
[time=1169] This year there are already more than 20, a 55% increase over where we were this point last year.
[time=1177] That's a sobering statistic, but this is after all a big city, a large county. But Gary Indiana last year had the distinction of being called the murder capital of the United States.
[time=1189] Not exactly what we had in mind is it when we sing back home in Indiana. We have to acknowledge that our culture, our society, has become much more violent over the last two to three decades. In 1960 there were 160 violent crimes for every 100,000 people in this country. In 1992 just 22, 32 years later there were 758. That's a 371 percent increase.
[time=1225] At least O.J. Simpson has made us more acutely aware of the violence in the home. In the July 4 issue of Time magazine there was a picture on the front. It shows a woman her eyes are black. Her face is bruised.
[time=1241] The caption says, "When violence hits home." The American Medical Association reports that at least one out of every three women will be assaulted by her domestic partner in her lifetime. That's from the May. So we're preoccupied by this subject because we think we might be victimized.
[time=1265] A second reason we're preoccupied is because let's be frank with one another. We're afraid. We're scared.
[time=1273] The media knows that. So they exploit the subject.
[time=1277] More than 20 percent of what you see on television is related to crime and violent crime.
[time=1281] Politicians know it. Have you ever heard of anyone running for office in a law and order plank? They'll give us safer streets.
[time=1289] The streets are less safe today than they have been.
[time=1293] So we try to cope with this fear in a number of ways. Some people do it by turning their home into a fortress. They buy burglar alarms.
[time=1301] They purchase electronic security. They put bars on all their windows.
[time=1305] They have an arsenal of firearms and ammunition.
[time=1309] My mother-in-law's house looks like Fort Knox, quite frankly.
[time=1313] Yet interestingly enough, young people today act as if they were not afraid.
[time=1321] Have you seen the t-shirts that many of these kids are wearing? They say no fear.
[time=1325] Last week I was walking behind a young man in the mall.
[time=1329] He was wearing one of these no-fear shirts and I watched him as he walked away and on the back of the shirt it said, I'm not scared. I'm not afraid.
[time=1337] I'm tough. I'm an animal. And I will eat you if I have to.
[time=1341] No fear.
[time=1345] Actually, he's scared out of his wits.
[time=1349] Very likely this young man was carrying a weapon of some kind because he's not afraid, mind you.
[time=1357] A third reason we're preoccupied with this subject is that many of us and no offense intended, many of us have been perpetrators of crime.
[time=1365] You didn't misunderstand me. Many of us have committed crimes.
[time=1369] I've heard Billy Graham say on more than one occasion in his crusades.
[time=1373] That in his heart he has violated every one of the ten commandments.
[time=1377] Well I know if it's true of Billy Graham it must be true of us.
[time=1381] My point is lawlessness after all is just a matter of degree.
[time=1389] The Bible says the spirit of lawlessness is at work in the sons of disobedience and we are disobedient and because we have been law breakers we're all disobedient. We too fall into the category in our sin nature without Christ.
[time=1405] I never cease to be amazed at the potential of human beings for the most incalculable evil without Christ at the center of our being.
[time=1417] Did you know that you're capable of doing anything? We ring our hands when we watch Schindler's list at the atrocities of World War II and then we see some of the same things happening in Bosnia in 1993 and 1994. The late Eric Hoffer who was a longshoreman and probably an unbeliever did have insight into human nature.
[time=1441] Hoffer said there is a totalitarian regime in each of us. "We are ruled," he said, "by a ruthless pallet bureau." I like the way Jeremiah put it better. He said the heart of man
[time=1457] is desperately corrupt. Who can understand it?
[time=1463] What Eric Hoffer calls a ruthless pallet bureau. The Bible calls the powers of this dark world. The spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
[time=1477] Doubtless, there are a number of people in here today who work in law enforcement.
[time=1481] I want you to know they work in a spiritual arena. They need more than bullet proof this. They need the whole armor of God. They need our prayers. They need our support. I've come to the conclusion that we're expecting too much out of these people working in law enforcement.
[time=1501] We're expecting too much out of law and order laying down the law is not the solution to our problems in America. Right now our Congress is debating a crime bill, spending an unprecedented amount, 22 billion dollars thinking that somehow this is going to solve the problem of crime and violence in this country. We can spend every last penny and we'll still have blood on the streets of America. Because Americans by and large have concluded that crime is primarily a biological, sociological, or psychological phenomenon.
[time=1541] Now there are some biologists, not all I add. I don't want to make generalizations about everyone, but there are some biologists who will tell you that people commit crimes because of defective genes. They have an extra chromosome in there somewhere. There are some psychologists who will tell you that aggression among adolescents and immigrants is because they had some kind of trauma during toilet training.
[time=1565] Think about it. There are some sociologists who will insist that crime is primarily a social and environmental problem. Poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, single parent homes, substandard housing, etc., etc., and it is true.
[time=1585] Many of these problems do contribute to the problem of crime in America.
[time=1589] But by saying these are the causes - you know what we've done?
[time=1593] We've made everybody a victim. No one is responsible anymore. We can address all of these problems and still not have solved the problem of crime in America.
[time=1605] People with jobs in full stomachs commit crime. Rich people who've never lacked for anything commit crime.
[time=1617] People who've never suffered racial discrimination and oppression commit crime because crime is basically fundamentally foundationally a spiritual problem.
[time=1629] Yet regrettably, our country is moving farther and farther away from the spiritual perspective.
[time=1637] Someone has wisely said there are three frontiers not yet fully explored. Outer space, the ocean depths, and the spirit of man. Our problems today in America are interior, inner space, the heart.
[time=1657] This is something that NASA can't handle.
[time=1661] This is something that Janet Rideau and the Department of Justice can't solve.
[time=1665] This is something that we in the Church of Jesus Christ must address in our outreach and in our mission.
[time=1673] And I don't think we can do that without adequately answering three questions.
[time=1677] First, how did law and order originate in the first place?
[time=1685] Why did law originate? What can we expect from law and order? What are its limitations? First, how did law come to be in the first place?
[time=1697] The secularist and the humanist would say that laws just well evolved like everything else.
[time=1705] Fred and Wilma Flintstone were sitting around in their cave one day and just kind of figured out they needed to do something to protect their assets. So they went to the cave down the street and talked to Barney and Betty Rubble and they decided to form a neighborhood association and put signs on their property saying no trespassing. That's how laws originated.
[time=1729] Or so they think. It's true that when we form communities we begin to develop a consensus about what we expect of one another. We call that a social contract what's permissible, what's prohibited, what is normative in our society.
[time=1745] But we need to go farther than that.
[time=1749] What does the Bible say about the origin of law and order?
[time=1753] Obviously we didn't have very many laws to begin with just one in fact don't eat it.
[time=1761] If you eat it you'll be sorry.
[time=1765] Leave it alone.
[time=1769] Laws don't mean very much unless they have punitive consequences.
[time=1773] How could we ever enforce laws without sanctions? That first law had a sanction. If you eat it you will die.
[time=1781] We've been dying ever since. I think more than any other book of the Bible the book of Romans teaches us why we need laws.
[time=1789] It tells us that there are two kinds of laws. There are written laws like the Ten Commandments like the Criminal Code of Indiana and there are unwritten laws.
[time=1801] Of unwritten laws the Bible tells us there are certain law principles that are true even when you don't write it down.
[time=1809] In other words there's a right and wrong even if there's never a magic that says they shall not do this. And the Bible illustrates that in Romans chapter 1 and 2. Paul says that both Jews and Gentiles are subject to law. The Jews have a written law and the Gentiles have an unwritten law. Something in nature in their conscience that helps them know the difference in right and wrong.
[time=1837] Listen to Romans chapter 2 verse 15. The requirements of the law are written on their hearts. Their consciences bearing witness. Having a conscience is a little like carrying a judge in a jury around in your head all the time.
[time=1853] When you do something that violates God's moral law guilty, thou shall not.
[time=1861] As the Bible says it accuses you or it excuses you.
[time=1865] What conclusions can we draw about written laws beyond our conscience about the criminal code of the state or about the requirements of the Ten Commandments? Well the Bible has a lot to say about that.
[time=1881] First of all the Bible teaches us without laws, without written laws we don't take sin and evil seriously enough.
[time=1889] For some reason it's hard for us to make the connection between the crimes that people are committing in the inner city of Fort Wayne and our own sin nature.
[time=1901] The Apostle Paul got rather sarcastic with the Jews because they couldn't make this connection between crime and sin. Paul said you who preach against stealing, do you steal? You who say do not commit adultery, do you commit adultery?
[time=1917] You who brag about the law, brag about law and order do you dishonor God by breaking the law?
[time=1925] 2, 21 through 24. If ever there were any doubt about this connection between crime and sin it's laid to rest in Romans chapter 3. Because in verse 10 the Bible says all are under the power of sin. There is none righteous, no not one. Altogether they have gone wrong.
[time=1945] In other words God gives us the law to show us how far off base we are.
[time=1953] It's interesting in the Hebrew language there are many words for sin. There are three very picturesque words however that give us a lot of insight into law and order.
[time=1965] The first word for sin in the Hebrew language means to miss the mark.
[time=1973] Obaying the law law and order is like target practice.
[time=1977] To obey the law perfectly you have to hit the bull's eye every time.
[time=1981] Anytime you miss the bull's eye you violate the law you sin. Now which one of us has ever hit a bull's eye every time? The second picturesque word for sin means to deviate from a straight line. In other words law and order is like walking a chalk line. If you ever stepped to the right or to the left you violated the law you sinned. The third word for sin means transgression. Law and order are obeying the law is staying within boundaries. Let's say the four corners here of this podium represent the boundaries in which I am to stay.
[time=2021] If I ever move this way or that way I'm out of bounds because it says over here no trespassing.
[time=2029] Well the conclusion is rather obvious isn't it?
[time=2033] In our human nature we are all outlaws. Can I repeat that?
[time=2041] In our human nature we're all outlaws because we all miss the mark.
[time=2045] We step off the line. We get where there's a sign saying no trespassing.
[time=2049] So the law was given to hold us accountable.
[time=2053] I think the Apostle Paul summarizes it well in Romans 3 19. He says whatever the law says it says to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God. If you ever visited a courtroom and the jury's deliberating and they say the jury's on its way back in a hush falls upon the courtroom.
[time=2077] The judge walks in the jury comes in the judge asks the foreman have you reached a verdict he says yes the defendant stands we say the defendant is guilty as charged. This is not a time for the defendant to make a speech and he generally doesn't.
[time=2093] He's dumb in silence. I like the way the living Bible paraphrases this the living Bible says the whole world stands hushed and guilty before Almighty God.
[time=2105] That's what the law does for us. There's also something a little strange and quirky about the law if I might say so. This was even true of the 10 commandments.
[time=2117] And God intended it to be that way. I don't mean to be offending the Almighty and saying there's something quirky about the law. God didn't intend for the 10 commandments to solve the problem of murder in America.
[time=2129] He didn't intend for law in order to solve the problem of stealing and of lying and of cheating.
[time=2137] Now if you're thoroughly confused I want you to listen to this verse of Scripture from Romans chapter 3. It says, law increases trespass. What could that possibly mean?
[time=2153] That sounds like the Bible is saying law in order leads to lawlessness and disorder.
[time=2161] How could that be true?
[time=2165] Romans chapter 5 verse 20 the Bible says the law was added that the trespass might increase. Or as the King James Version said the law entered that the offense might abound. And you must be scratching your head and saying well how could that be true? How could the law lead to lawlessness?
[time=2181] I'm going to tell you.
[time=2185] Haven't you had the experience of being told not to do something?
[time=2189] And it made you want to do it? My little two year old grandson Clark and I had such an experience last week.
[time=2197] I was talking on the telephone and he wants all of my attention.
[time=2201] So anytime I'm on the phone he comes and tries to cut me off and I've told him over and over don't do that. And I was having what I considered a very important conversation. He walked up and reached over. I said Clark don't touch the phone. In a minute he was back again with one finger, inching toward the phone just touching the outside I said Clark don't touch the phone.
[time=2225] Still talking. The moment I looked down he was barefoot.
[time=2229] He had taken his little fat bare feet, had caught the cord of the telephone between the big toe and the middle toe and was pulling it. I said Clark Papa told you not to touch the phone.
[time=2241] I continued talking. In a moment he had found the plug that goes in the wall and he was over there trying to pull it out. Now at this point Clark knew that what Papa said would have punitive consequences as soon as I got off the phone.
[time=2257] But he did it anyway. Why?
[time=2261] Because law increases trespass.
[time=2265] We laugh because in our own experience we know that there have been many times when a prohibition thou shalt not lead to an act violating the very prohibition.
[time=2279] The late John Cheever who was a Pulitzer prize winner wrote a short story about a woman named Mrs. Cabot.
[time=2287] Mrs. Cabot was a very, very religious woman.
[time=2291] And when Cheever was a lad in grammar school Mrs.
[time=2295] Cabot would come to school to talk to the children. She liked to talk about her travels and she liked to give them moral lessons.
[time=2303] But she really spoke on only three subjects. One was her trip to Alaska and she would always show a slideshow which they probably hated.
[time=2311] The other two topics were the evils of drinking and the evils of tobacco. Cheever said of Mrs.
[time=2319] Cabot, boozing it up, was so unthinkable to Mrs.
[time=2323] Cabot that she really couldn't muster up a lot of vigor and vengeance in addressing that topic.
[time=2327] It just seemed unrealistic. But when it came to tobacco the thought of tobacco made her livid with rage. And so she would teach the children about the evils of tobacco. She would say children, could you imagine the Lord Jesus Christ smoking on the cross?
[time=2347] Could you imagine the Virgin Mary having a smoke?
[time=2351] She said children did you know that a drop of nicotine fed to a pig by trained laboratory technicians will kill the beast.
[time=2363] Cheever looking back on Mrs. Cabot said, Mrs. Cabot made smoking seem so irresistible.
[time=2371] So irresistible that if I die from lung cancer I will blame Mrs. Cabot.
[time=2379] A strange thing indeed but Mrs. Cabot made him want to smoke.
[time=2383] Her legalistic way of talking about cigarettes made smoking seem irresistible. Law increases trespass. Now if you don't want to be the story about Mrs. Cabot you'll believe the Apostle Paul because he said the law had the same effect on him. And Paul added it was really not the law's fault. The law was holy and good.
[time=2407] It was his fault, his sin nature. Listen to Paul. He said I would not have known what coveting was if the law had not said thou shalt not covet. But sin seizing the opportunity afforded by the law produced in me all kinds of covetous desire. Paul said the law made me covet more. That's how our sin nature responds to law in order.
[time=2435] I like the way the living Bible embraces this difficult theological concept. Listen. When your old sin nature was still active sinful desires were at work within you making you want to do whatever God said not to do producing sinful deeds the rotting fruit of death. That's an apt characterization of what's happening on the streets of America today the rotting fruit of death.
[time=2467] We don't have to go to places like Cambodia or Bosnia to find killing fields. The streets of our inner cities are killing fields and it is futile for us to think spending 22 billion dollars is going to solve that problem. It doesn't mean that we don't need to build more prisons we do. It doesn't mean that we don't need to hire more policemen we do but we shouldn't be deceived into believing that these are the solution to what the Bible calls the rotting fruit of death we can spend every last dime and still have killing in the center of Fort Wayne. I think this has tremendous implications for public policy in America today.
[time=2511] I think it has implications for church polity and for practices in my home and for my own efforts to control my own behavior. My friends it simply takes more than laying down the law it takes more than trying to control bad behavior. In fact if that's all you're doing you're going to make matters worse.
[time=2539] There's a remarkable verse of scripture that tells us this that we have often misinterpreted. In fact if you have a King James version one verse might lead you to the wrong conclusion you need to read the whole thing.
[time=2551] That's Colossians 2, 20 through 23. I won't read it but I'm going to paraphrase it for you. Colossians 2, 20 through 23.
[time=2559] The Bible says here that if you are depending on law and order if you are depending on rules and regulations like don't touch, don't taste, don't handle it may make sense to you. It may seem like wisdom to you but the Bible says it has absolutely no value in restraining sensual desires.
[time=2583] Think about it.
[time=2587] The Bible says there are some things that law does well there are some things the law cannot do. The law brings justice Romans 3.25 but the law can make no man perfect Hebrew 7.19 At this point I would like to summarize what we've learned about law and order. We've learned that there's an indivisible connection between crime and sin. We've learned that regardless of what contributes to our problems in America either psychologically or sociologically and there are many variables. At its root crime is a spiritual problem. We've learned that individuals working in the justice system are working in a spiritual arena they need to be armed with a whole arm of God they need our prayers and our support. We've learned number 4 that we're expecting too much out of law and order. And number 6 we've learned what the purposes of law are to show us that we miss the mark that we get out of bounds to show us how bad bad really is. To show us that without something more than law and order we're all outlaws and to show us how laws can actually increase the offending. Let me put it in a different way if you haven't grasped all of that. Law and order indict very well.
[time=2671] Law condemns and it does that very well.
[time=2675] The law brings guilt and it does that exceptionally well. The law brings punishment but when you add all of that up what do you have? You have shame. That's how we feel when we violate God's moral law. We feel ashamed but that's about all guilt and shame. This is the outcome of law.
[time=2699] But this is exactly what God intended for us to feel.
[time=2703] Law and order take away all our defenses.
[time=2707] This is what the Bible calls nakedness.
[time=2711] Spiritual nakedness. The ultimate shame is to be stripped of all your defenses, all your clothes, and to stand there naked before Almighty God and before the public.
[time=2723] Someone has described shame this way.
[time=2727] Listen. To feel shame is to feel seen, seen in a painfully diminished sense.
[time=2735] The self feels exposed.
[time=2739] Contained in this experience of shame is the piercing awareness of ourselves as fundamentally deficient in some vital way as a human being. Shame is an impotence making experience.
[time=2751] One has simply failed as a human being.
[time=2755] When Adam and Eve violated the one law they were given, they realized they were naked and they were ashamed. They tried to cover up. It's interesting but a study has been done of the criminal justice system to determine what people fear most about law and order.
[time=2779] More than they fear being caught, more than they fear going to prison, they fear the public humiliation and embarrassment and shame of the experience.
[time=2791] That's what law and order gives you.
[time=2795] If you were to ask O.J. Simpson now what he's having the hardest part with, it's probably the shame this hero of sports is experiencing at this time.
[time=2807] I've said all of that to say this.
[time=2811] I have good news for you today. God only gave us the law so he could give us something better.
[time=2819] God demands justice all right but the Bible says mercy, triumphs over judgment.
[time=2827] James chapter 2 verse 13.
[time=2831] And in one of my favorite verses from the Phillips translation, Romans 5-20 the Bible says those sin is shown to be wide and deep and that's what law and order does. It shows us how wide and deep sin is. Those sin is shown to be wide and deep thank God his mercy is wider and deeper still.
[time=2851] Nothing dramatizes the difference between God's justice and his mercy better than the story of two mountains.
[time=2859] The first mountain is a mountain of law. It's a steep mountain. You can climb and climb and never reach the top. You can use every ounce of self effort and self control and never reach the summit. This mountain of law is a fearful mountain. There rocks and cliffs and crags and rough terrain. It's painful because you're going to fall down over and over. You're going to stumble. Some of you today have been trying to climb that legalistic mountain and you're bledded and bruised by the experience.
[time=2899] I can tell you you'll never reach the top.
[time=2903] The second mountain, however, is the mountain of hope. This is a mountain that you don't have to climb because there's a mountain climber that will carry you to the top. He promises you that you will reach the summit.
[time=2923] You're never naked on this mountain. You never feel shame.
[time=2927] You're always reassured and comforted.
[time=2931] You're able to rest on the mountain of hope.
[time=2935] The book of Hebrews in your New Testament describes these two mountains in greater detail. In chapter 12, it describes Mount Sinai on which God first gave his moral law on tablets of stone.
[time=2951] When God called Moses to Mount Sinai, he gave him instructions and he said to Moses, "I want you to establish a boundary around the mountain." Now remember what we learned earlier about boundaries and lines and forbidden territory?
[time=2967] This is the mountain of law. The Bible is describing. He says, "Moses, I want you to establish a boundary around the mountain. No one can cross this line, man or animal." If anyone touches this mountain of law, they will die.
[time=2983] I think it's significant in understanding law in order to note that this mountain was off limits. There were signs all around it saying, "No trespassing. Thou shalt not." The way the Bible describes that mountain is very significant.
[time=2999] It was a fearful scene. There was a thick cloud surrounding the mountain. There was smoke billowing up from the mountain as if it were from a deep furnace. There was an earthquake shaking the mountain and the whole mountain trembled violently, the Bible says.
[time=3015] And there was a sound of a trumpet that got louder and louder and louder and the Bible says, "Everyone trembled." That's the effect that laying down the law is supposed to have on us. We tremble in fear.
[time=3031] God was establishing a covenant of law with his people through Moses. But this covenant of law was given to show us the need for another covenant.
[time=3043] We would not have been prepared for another mountain if we hadn't first stumbled on the first mountain.
[time=3051] This mountain would not be a covenant of law and order like Mount Sinai. It would be a covenant based on grace and mercy and forgiveness. And this God sent covenant maker would not be called a law man.
[time=3067] This mountain climber would be called a Messiah, a deliverer. Bible says that law and order were given to us as a school master for one purpose to bring us to Christ.
[time=3083] The law is a teacher to teach us about the need for Jesus, Galatians 3, 24. The law was never intended to function as a healer or a deliverer or a savior.
[time=3095] In ancient times, a teacher was a harsh and demanding figure. They called the teacher the pedagogue. Even in early America, there was a picture like on the wall of a one room schoolhouse of a teacher.
[time=3111] And it was a pedagogue with a rod. And he was standing in a menacing way over the student, forcing the student to learn. The rod was the learning enforcer. The law serves as a learning enforcer.
[time=3127] Showing us the difference in right and wrong. Showing us how wrong we are.
[time=3131] Showing us we can never get right on our own. Showing us that we need someone else to climb the mountain for us.
[time=3139] My friends, the Lord Jesus Christ is the mountain climber.
[time=3147] He has already climbed that legalistic mountain for you all the way to the top. And he did it without violating one law. Yet, though he kept the law perfectly, we treated him like a criminal. He wants to pick us up today, bruised and blooded, fearful, and ashamed as we are.
[time=3171] In our efforts through self-control and self-will, he wants to bring us to this other mountain of grace, this mountain of joy where we can receive total and complete forgiveness. There's no fear, no shame. You'll never be naked on this mountain. I want you to listen this morning as the Bible describes these two mountains from Hebrews chapter 12. If you want to turn, it begins in verse when I get my glasses on, 18.
[time=3203] Listen, Hebrews 12 verse 18, a description of the two mountains, the mountain of law and the mountain of hope.
[time=3211] You have not come to a mountain that can be touched, that is burning with fire, to darkness, gloom, and storm, to a trumpet blast, or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them, because they could not bear what was commanded. If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned. The site was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear." But you, but you have come to Mount Zion to the heavenly Jerusalem, the city of the living God. You have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly to the church of the first born whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all men, to the spirits of righteous men made perfect. Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkle blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel. You see, Abel was the first victim of a crime.
[time=3283] The very first homicide when the law was violated, resulting in ultimately the rotting stench of death. That's not the kind of blood we've come to. We've come to the sprinkle blood of a new covenant. I don't know which mountain you've been trying to climb, but if you feel the need today for something more than law and order, we're here to offer it to you through the Lord Jesus Christ. If you've been climbing and climbing and climbing but never getting to the top, you need to give it all over to the mountain climber.
[time=3319] The Bible says in Romans 10 verse 4, Christ is the end of the law. Christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes. And then in Romans 10 verse 11 the Bible says, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame." That's good news.
[time=3343] I won't ever be put to shame because I trust in him.
[time=3347] Let's sing a song of invitation this morning. There may be some here today who failed the legalistic route, who've been depending on thou shalt nots in their lives rather than on the power of the Spirit of God through Jesus Christ. And the powerful motivating force of his amazing grace.
[time=3367] In this song of decision I have decided to follow Jesus. We invite you to come as well as those who might wish to identify where this church or who for any reason need the prayers of the elders.
[time=3379] Well it's been a privilege to present the Bible
[time=3403] to you today with our special music from the Sanctuary Choir in Orchestra our special guest Jonathan Birchfield and soloist Susan Stump.

[time=3419] If as a result of today's program you sense that you have a need to trust Christ as your Savior we always close the Bible hour with an opportunity for you to accept Christ as your Savior. You can do that right now by simply praying this prayer with me. Dear Heavenly Father I've come to realize that I've never accepted you as my personal Savior. I ask you to forgive me of the sins that I've committed Lord and come into my heart today. In Jesus name I pray Amen. If you prayed that prayer today why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision. When you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled Lessons on Assurance.
