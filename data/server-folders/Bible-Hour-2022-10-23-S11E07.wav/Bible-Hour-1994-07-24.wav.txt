[time=0] He raises this critical question or critical issue in the form of a question.
[time=7] The issue is does all faith save a person or does some faith not save people by virtue
[time=15] of it being as he calls it later a dead faith and then there's another kind of faith that actually does save a person.
[time=23] He's all faith saving faith in other words.
[time=39] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=47] Thank you for joining us.
[time=48] Did you know that not everyone who believes in Jesus will be saved?
[time=53] Did you know that there are two kinds of faith?
[time=56] One is a useless faith which the Bible calls dead faith and the other is a saving faith which the Bible calls living faith.
[time=64] Which kind of faith do you have?
[time=66] Well we invite you to stay with us today to find out, let's join our service.
[time=96] [MUSIC - 464 seconds]
[time=584] Well I can't tell you today how thankful I am that we have the opportunity to present to you the Bible Hour.
[time=591] And I want to take a moment and just talk specifically about the people that are members of our Founders Club.
[time=596] We're so thankful that you give faithfully to support this ministry each week.
[time=601] We've come to the end of our fiscal year and I'm happy to say that the Bible Hour ended up in the black.
[time=607] Now we didn't end up in the black very much, we're just kind of over the line of our budget.
[time=611] But I'm thankful that many of you have written in and you give faithfully each month to support the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=619] And I want to thank all of you that have written in for the first time and you've expressed an interest in the Bible Hour and supporting it with your prayers.
[time=626] And you've asked for some of the gift offers, I'm just thankful that we meet new people each week that watch the Bible Hour and we're grateful for that.
[time=634] I just want to remind you that this month we're offering a telephone address book. It's in celebration of our 25th year of the Black Hawk Baptist Church and we'll send it to you absolutely free.
[time=645] Just write to us and tell us that you watch the Bible Hour and we'll send it to you.
[time=650] You can receive it by writing to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=659] Just tell us that you're watching and ask for the telephone address book. Again, the address is the Bible Hour, 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.
[time=673] Once again, thank you for listening, we go back to the live portion of our service now. Let's listen to Lynn Roll as she ministers to us in song.
[time=689] [MUSIC]
[time=3403] Oh, we're thankful for the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir today and soloist John Gonsor and Lynn Roll.
[time=3410] The message was from our pastor, teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3413] I just want to remind you in the book of Romans it says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
[time=3422] You can pray a prayer today that you can ask Jesus Christ to come into your heart and He'll become your Savior.
[time=3428] I want to take a moment and pray that prayer with you today. Let's bow together.
[time=3432] Dear Heavenly Father, can I thank You that I could come to You and I can tell You that I've sinned against You and I'm sorry for my sin.
[time=3440] I ask You to forgive me of the sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. Come into my heart.
[time=3446] In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
[time=3449] If you prayed that prayer today, if you've accepted Christ as your Savior, why don't you write us and tell us about your decision.
[time=3456] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled, "Lessons on Assurance." It'll help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
