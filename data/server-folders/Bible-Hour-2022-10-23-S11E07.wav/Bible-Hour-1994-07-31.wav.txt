[time=0] So the Bible clearly teaches, and we developed this last week, that there is at least two
[time=6] kinds of faith.
[time=7] There is a dead faith that does not save.
[time=11] And then there secondly is a living faith that does save people.
[time=27] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you will find to be an encouragement.
[time=35] Thank you for joining us.
[time=37] Have you ever known anyone who claims to be a Christian, but who lives a life that doesn't honor God?
[time=43] Have you ever wondered if people like that are truly saved?
[time=46] Does the Bible make any distinctions between true saving faith and mere ascent to the existence
[time=53] of God?
[time=54] Well, for answers to these questions, stay with us today as Pastor Moore teaches from God's Word on the marks of true saving faith.
[time=62] Our special music today will be provided by reflection and Michelle Smeckens.
[time=72] Let's join our service.
[time=89] Let's get together and want to call everyone that's listening to my voice.

[time=321] together, let's get together, let's get together, let's get together, let's get together,
[time=657] when I stumble, heaven knows when I'm strong, there is nothing I can hide from the one
[time=667] who knows it all, heaven knows when I need answers and I'm barely holding on, there's
[time=677] one place I can go, heaven knows, a greater love will never find, but we can go to him
[time=695] anytime, heaven knows when I stumble, heaven knows when I'm strong, there is nothing I
[time=707] can hide from the one who knows it all, heaven knows when I need answers and I'm barely holding
[time=717] on, there's just one place I can go, heaven knows, heaven knows when we stumble, heaven
[time=729] knows when we're strong, there is nothing we can hide from the one who knows it all,
[time=739] heaven knows when I need answers and I'm barely holding on, there's just one place we can
[time=749] go, heaven knows, there's just one place we can go, heaven knows.
[time=762] Amen, it's a wonderful truth, it almost comes right out of Hebrews chapter 4 I think where
[time=774] it says everything is open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do, heaven definitely knows and he cares.
[time=782] Okay how about James chapter 2 this morning as we go back to our study of this marvelous text we started it last week and we get to finish it by God's grace this week and in
[time=794] James chapter 2 verse 14 James is raising a critical issue that brings all of us to
[time=801] stop and take attention and listen carefully to how he answers the issue that he poses in the form of a question.
[time=808] James chapter 2 verse 14 what use is it my brethren?
[time=813] If a man says he has faith but he has no works can that faith save him?
[time=820] The question that he's asking and the issue that he is raising is can a faith that has no works save a person?
[time=829] Now this is an incredible passage and he answers it with an emphatic no.
[time=835] His answer is absolutely not don't even think for a minute that faith a faith that does not
[time=842] work can save a person.
[time=845] Now this is kind of part two in a message on this in a series of messages on this text
[time=851] and I'm concerned for some of you who may not have been here last week because we laid a foundation last week that I felt was necessary to keep anybody from misunderstanding me and
[time=864] more importantly this text that we would be suggesting that salvation is by works.
[time=872] The Bible does not teach that you get saved by works and so I just want to say right up front if any point in my message this morning you think that I am teaching that you get saved by works you need to get the tape from last week and listen to that and go back through that foundation because that is not what the Bible teaches and that is not what I believe.
[time=892] In fact we laid down two basic foundations in last week's messages the first was that one we are saved by grace through faith.
[time=901] The only way a person is saved is by grace the unmerited favor of God.
[time=906] God giving us something we don't deserve which pretty well rules out works all together.
[time=911] There is no possible way to earn the favor of God with respect to salvation.
[time=915] It is only his unmerited favor through his grace that he gives us salvation.
[time=920] Now how do you get that grace?
[time=922] How does that grace become active in your life through the conduit of faith?
[time=928] Faith is the only way to find your way into the grace of God.
[time=933] The second thing we laid down last week is that not all faith is saving faith and that becomes a very important issue when you find out that the only way to be saved is by the grace of God and the only way to have the grace of God in your life is by exercising your faith in the person of Jesus Christ then the quality of your faith becomes of paramount importance.
[time=954] My only hope for salvation is through faith is my faith saving faith, is my faith the kind
[time=960] of faith that in fact allows me to be saved by God.
[time=965] We looked at the Word of God and we found out there are at least two kinds of faith presented in the Word of God one is a dead faith and it is not saving it is damning.
[time=975] There's another kind of faith a living saving faith and so we have reason then to raise
[time=981] the issue as James is to ask the question is the faith without works the kind of faith
[time=988] that saves people and as I've said James says no.
[time=992] Now in his answer he gives us two examples of each kind of faith.
[time=997] He gives us two examples of dead faith and then he gives us two examples of living faith
[time=1003] so that we can contrast those and be in a position then to look at our own lives and have some assurance that we are truly saved or have some assurance that we have deceived
[time=1014] ourselves we just think we're saved and we're not really saved.
[time=1020] Last week we got a chance to look at the first one and it's in verses 15 and 16 you remember if a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food and one of you says to them go in peace be warmed and be filled and yet you do not give them what is necessary
[time=1036] for their body what use is that even so faith if it has no works is dead being by itself.
[time=1044] Remember what we probably have here is a fellow Christian who is in a position of extreme destitution and the Greek here lets us or indicates that this condition of needing clothing
[time=1055] and needing food is a pre-existing condition prior to they're asking you for help or prior
[time=1061] to you're coming upon their situation so it seems as if they've been cold and hungry for some time they may be naked and starving it may be absolutely to the brink of life and death and this kind of faith this dead faith doesn't do anything about it a brother
[time=1079] or sister in Christ in extreme destitution and all you get is verse 16 go in peace be warm and be filled a very nice congenial greeting go in peace bless you my brother have a nice
[time=1091] day God be with you but then be warmed and be filled which either means warm and fill
[time=1097] yourself or I hope somebody else warms and fill you but it's clear I'm not going to do it I am not going to act my faith does not work as a result I leave you in your condition
[time=1111] of destitution now this morning we get to the the second example of dead faith and it's
[time=1118] called demon faith and we move from the more concrete example of a naked and starving person
[time=1125] into the middle of a theological debate going on between James and an imaginary antagonist
[time=1132] and he no doubt has heard this concern before he believes it's in the minds of the people he's speaking or writing to and so he just creates the scenario and it goes I believe
[time=1142] something like this James is facing an antagonist who is saying the critical issue in my faith
[time=1149] the critical issue in whether or not I'm saved or not is not my works don't try to evaluate my faith and my salvation based upon my works the antagonist is saying this the critical
[time=1161] issue is the content of my faith the issue is am I orthodox am I biblical do I have faith
[time=1171] in the right stuff and he wants to shift the focus of the argument off a faith that produces
[time=1178] evidence of itself on to the very content of the faith itself and so James says in verse
[time=1185] 18 but someone may well say you have faith and I have works show me your faith without
[time=1194] the works and I will show you my faith by my works the key phrase there is show me your faith without your works how do you do that how do you do that supposing he grants for
[time=1206] a moment the argument supposing you do have orthodox faith supposing you are believing in the right things how will we know show it to me without works impossible you can't
[time=1218] do it why faith is invisible you can't see a person's faith you can't see your own faith
[time=1224] the only thing you can see is the product of faith it's like the wind you can't see the wind the only way you know the wind is blowing is by virtue of the impact that it has it
[time=1235] makes noise and leaves move and sometimes trees fall over but you never can see the wind it's
[time=1242] like electricity you never can see electricity it's impossible it's invisible the only way
[time=1248] you know you've got electricity on your hand is by what electricity does you check the outlet
[time=1254] and you get zapped you got you got heat there you got electricity you flip the switch and the lights come on you gotta let how do you know you don't know because you see the electricity you know because you see the product of the electricity so he is saying it's ridiculous
[time=1269] for you to suggest that we could evaluate the reality of your faith based upon the content of your faith because you can't show it to me it's invisible it's like me saying to you
[time=1282] I am a great pianist I am a gifted pianist I am an accomplished pianist I am a phenomenal
[time=1291] pianist I am as good as Scott Schindler on the piano you see this is my profession and
[time=1299] you say to me okay help yourself there it is show us when I go over there and there's
[time=1308] absolute chaos nothing you all leave quickly chopsticks gets old okay that's his point
[time=1317] he's saying even if I grant you for the moment that the issue is the content of your faith
[time=1323] it doesn't do anything for you because you can't show me the content of your faith unless your faith works so we're right back to his original point faith without works is dead
[time=1333] now he moves on in verse 19 and he just puts a blazing thing a barb into this man's argument
[time=1341] verse 19 you believe that God is one okay you want to talk orthodox let's go back to the great shema of Deuteronomy 6 let's talk about let's talk about fundamentalism let's
[time=1352] talk about true believing faith here for a little bit and we'll just see what happens
[time=1358] and so we're back in Deuteronomy 6 in this man's mind remember this is a Jewish readership they would have known that the cardinal fundamental belief is found in Deuteronomy 6 that we believe
[time=1368] our Lord the Lord God is one God they are not into polytheism as is this great pagan
[time=1374] culture all around them and so they are fundamental in belief and he is presenting himself as this great fundamental person the problem is is that demons believe the same stuff he says
[time=1389] that's no big deal it's no big deal that you believe God is one you do well the demons also believe and shudder the fact is from Matthew 8 for example and we can look at different
[time=1402] places in the New Testament that demons are known to be very orthodox in their faith that they are very conservative in their faith the demons there in Matthew 8 say to the Lord when he comes he says they say why are you oh son of God that's good theology why are
[time=1420] you oh son of God come to torment us before the time why have you come to torment us before
[time=1428] the time that's remarkably good theology it reveals they believe in the deity of Christ
[time=1434] the son of God it reveals they as he already has said to say they believe in the unity of the Godhood they believe in the Trinity they believe in the deity of Christ the death of Christ the resurrection of Christ the ascension of Christ they have to because they know he's coming again to torment them they have a wonderful eschatology they understand that at the end of the age Jesus Christ will rule all of them and torment them eternally which means they believe in heaven and they believe in hell the fact is that demons could probably sign
[time=1462] the doctrinal statement of Blackhawk Baptist Church without compromising what they believe
[time=1468] they are orthodox they know the truth they believe the truth is true and they go one step
[time=1475] further than an orthodox believer or a person with orthodox faith with no works at least these demons shudder as opposed to this antagonist who says I can't show you any response to
[time=1488] my faith these demons are fundamental in their belief and they shudder they know what's coming
[time=1495] their way the point is are they saved absolutely not they are on their way to hell and they
[time=1501] know it they are hell bound so they have a dead faith they have a faith that ascribes
[time=1509] to the facts of the gospel but have not entrusted themselves to it have not submitted to it have not been transformed by it and are not living consistent with it it's called a dead faith and they are the the premium example of orthodoxy that is on its way to hell so he says in verse
[time=1526] 20 but are you willing to recognize you foolish fellow that faith without works is useless in
[time=1534] other words if you have a brand of faith that does not produce works you have a brand of faith that is useless and condemns you to hell pretty powerful argument huh I mean it's
[time=1547] tough to get any more direct than that okay so those are the two negative examples those are the two examples of a dead faith now we get to turn the corner and go to the positive examples of saving faith and these are just absolutely heart wrenching verse 21 he's going
[time=1563] to give two of them one of them is with Abraham and one of them is with Rahab now Abraham and Rahab show up here because again you have a Jewish readership of this letter these Jews would have studied the Old Testament and they knew exactly who Abraham was they knew exactly who Rahab was and they were familiar with the accounts as they are recorded and we will look at them momentarily verse 21 was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered
[time=1589] up Isaac his son on the altar you see that faith was working with his works and as a
[time=1595] result of the works faith was perfected and the scripture was fulfilled which says and Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness and he was called the friend of God you see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone and in the
[time=1611] same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers
[time=1618] and sent them out by another way okay those are the examples now let's go back and figure out more specifically what he's talking about come to Genesis chapter 15 for a minute and you can actually lose your place in James will be here for just a little while and we'll
[time=1633] get a little better understanding some of you who have been in the church a long time are very familiar with these stories others of you aren't and so we'll take a moment and
[time=1642] refresh our minds now remember Abraham is this great man of God in fact he is commented
[time=1653] on several times in several different places in the New Testament as this supreme example of faith and it's fitting that in James where we're going to talk about a faith that's real that he gets brought back up to show that while he is the supreme example of being saved by faith he also has all the works to go with it all the all the works that accompany true
[time=1674] saving faith God is looking just a little background God is looking to save the world
[time=1680] he's always been trying to do that ever since the Garden of Eden and since nations came into existence God has been trying to reach people in all the nations of the world with the gospel and at this particular period in history he is going to do it through a man to raise up a nation and that nation the nation of Israel will then be the mouth piece of God the spokesman of God and the way that God works with them and the way that they work with God will be everybody's for spiritual laws track if you will this is this is evangelism in the Old Testament they watch the nation of Israel they get the clue that their gods
[time=1713] plural polytheism their false religious system is obviously the wrong religious system because
[time=1719] that God the God that's associated with those people is greater and a higher and more magnificent
[time=1725] than our God so we have the wrong system that was the idea that's the plan he's got to find a man he finds a man by the name of Abram changes his name to Abraham and here they are in the midst of a wonderful discussion about how this nation is going to come into existence Genesis 15 5 Abraham's having trouble figuring this out so God took him outside and said now look
[time=1746] toward the heavens and count the stars if you are able to count them and he said to him so
[time=1753] shall your descendants be now because Abraham's having difficulty getting the concept that
[time=1759] out of his loins could come an entire nation that would be beyond number God uses an object lesson and he brings Abraham outside the tent there and says now look up can you count those
[time=1770] stars the obvious answer is no I can't count those stars they are innumerable then God says
[time=1777] you got it that's exactly how many of your descendants will come out through your loins
[time=1783] in the building of the nation of Israel so shall your descendants be now this is what's remarkable from Abraham's perspective look at verse 6 then he believed in the Lord and
[time=1796] the Lord reckoned it to him as righteousness that is the point of faith for Abraham that
[time=1803] is the point where Abraham is saved that is the point where Abraham is declared right with God that is the point where his faith is exercised and he is a believing person in
[time=1816] God and so you understand no works associated there he just went outside looked up said okay if you say so I believe and with that all that it meant to believe in that God to
[time=1827] do those things and it was reckoned to him for righteousness now come to Genesis 22 and
[time=1833] will skip through a number number decades of his life and as you remember he had a tough
[time=1839] go of it because the Lord so wanted to test him throughout his experience that he allowed
[time=1846] his wife's womb to dry up before even the first descendant showed up now remember he's
[time=1852] promised more than he can count his wife is now past the age of childbearing he himself is past the age of procreation and there isn't one descendant yet but he's still believing
[time=1864] in God God meets with them and says that time of your life is over he opens her womb and
[time=1871] outcomes the blessed child Isaac he is the he is the one guy now that we've got that
[time=1877] God can keep all of his promises through to produce all of these descendants and to reach
[time=1884] the nations of the world with the gospel it all rides on Isaac's shoulders which sets
[time=1892] the scene here you go Genesis 22 now it came about after these things that God tested Abraham
[time=1899] and said to him Abraham and he said here I am and he said take now your son your only
[time=1907] son whom you love Isaac you hear it you understand what I've said this is it this is the kid this is the way God kept his promise the whole program rests on Isaac and go to the land
[time=1919] of Mariah and offer him there as a bird offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you that's inconceivable that is absolutely inconceivable from every direction God condemned
[time=1931] human sacrifices that was a practice of the pagan gods and the pagan religions in their society he had he had outlawed it it's murder in addition to that it is the covenant child
[time=1943] Isaac it makes if Isaac is gone and now Abraham's a hundred and twenty plus I mean
[time=1949] how are we ever going to get another child how are you going to keep your covenant that makes you a liar God that means you didn't you're not going to be true to what you said to me I mean the whole ball of wax is on the line in that statement I want you to go up here and offer him as a bird offering that's a test but guess what Abraham's faith was
[time=1969] saving faith and so we know therefore it will do what it will work it will obey it will
[time=1976] do what saving faith always does it will obey verse three so but Abraham rose early
[time=1983] in the morning and saddle his donkey conspicuously absent is the bargaining the pleading the praying
[time=1989] the thinking that you and I might have embarked on with God he just does it took two of his
[time=1995] young men with him and Isaac his son and he split wood for the burn offering and arose
[time=2001] and went to the place of which God had told him on the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance the place where he was going to offer his son Abraham said to his young men stay here with the donkey and I and the lad will go yonder and we will
[time=2017] worship that's faith friends and we will worship and return to you and Abraham took the wood
[time=2025] of the burn offering and laid it on Isaac his son and took in his hand the fire and the knife so the two of them walked on together and Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said my father here am I my son behold the fire in the wood but where's the lamb for the
[time=2041] bird offering and Abraham said God will provide for himself the lamb for the burn offering
[time=2047] my son so the two of them walked on together then they came to the place which God had told him and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood and bound his son Isaac
[time=2058] and laid him on the altar on top of the wood and Abraham stretched out his hand and took
[time=2065] the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called him from heaven and said Abraham
[time=2071] Abraham he said here I am and he said do not stretch out your hand against the lad and
[time=2078] do nothing to him for now I know that you fear God since you have not withheld your
[time=2084] son your only son from me Abraham went past a point of no return with that knife Abraham
[time=2093] picked the knife up and was on the way down God knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Abraham
[time=2099] was fully intending to slay his son and at that moment he stopped Abraham from doing it now friends that is a faith that works and that is exactly God's commentary on the
[time=2111] thing now I know that you fear God since you have not withheld your son your only son
[time=2119] from me it is a faith that is willing to put the most precious thing in his life on the
[time=2125] line personally and as far as an endearing father to his son and also even the promises
[time=2132] of God he risked everything and obedience out of his faith faith works come out of Joshua
[time=2142] to for a minute as long as we're in the Old Testament and we'll see Rahab and you'll watch this woman work totally different kind of person she's not a Jew she's a Gentile she's
[time=2152] not a great leader she's a follower she's not some person like Abraham who was in the
[time=2158] high ranks of society she is at the bottom of a degraded social scale as a prostitute in one of the most pagan cities in the ancient world but man does she have faith and man
[time=2170] does this faith work it's exciting Jericho as a city is absolutely terrified because
[time=2176] Israel has encamped itself just a few miles to the east and the people of Jericho have
[time=2182] heard about the mighty God who comes with the nation of Israel and they are absolutely
[time=2188] overwhelmed with fear and so they have strengthened the security of their city the gates are closing at such and such a time every night there are people looking everywhere for anything that might indicate the coming of the nation of Israel in war Joshua has sent two spies
[time=2204] out of the nation of Israel across the river and into the city of Jericho so they could gather strategic information about the city these two spies trying to disguise themselves
[time=2214] as common travelers decide to go to a brothel where a lot of common travelers would go I mean that's a pretty safe place to go if you're just a common traveler you're not trying to be found out common thing for men to do wrong obviously but common so they find
[time=2229] their way to this brothel hoping there to not be found out and to hear the talk of the tavern and listen and get some insight in the conditions of the city the unfortunate thing is or fortunate
[time=2241] depending on how you look at it is they are discovered they are found out and those who find them out go to the king of Jericho the governor of that city and he sends word to Rahab because not only are they found out their location is also revealed and so Joshua
[time=2255] 22 it was told the king of Jericho saying behold men from the sons of Israel have come
[time=2261] here tonight to search out the land and the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab saying bring out the men who have come to you who have entered your house for they come to search out all the land but the woman had taken the two men and hidden them and she said yes the men came to me but I do not know where they were from liar and it came about
[time=2284] when it was time to shut the gate at dark that the men went out I do not know where
[time=2290] the men went pursue them quickly for you will overtake them but she had brought them up to the roof and hidden them in the stocks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof so the men pursued them on the road to Jordan as soon as those who were pursuing
[time=2305] them had gone they shut the gate just another indication of the high security that they were under so here you have a woman who is risking her life lying to representatives
[time=2316] of the king in an act of treason which if found out would eventually in her near immediate
[time=2322] execution she now has her own life on the line you say why would she do that what's
[time=2331] motivating her to be taking such a huge risk well listen to her in verse nine she said
[time=2337] to the men I know that the Lord has given you the land and that the terror of you has
[time=2343] fallen on us and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted away before you for
[time=2349] we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt and what you did to the two kings of Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to
[time=2360] Saihon and Og whom you utterly destroyed and we heard it and our hearts melted and our
[time=2366] courage and no courage remained any more among us because of you now stop right there
[time=2373] you can get the impression that she's just really clever and she's trying to make a kind of a change of national identity here quick so she can stay with the winning nation and
[time=2383] really all she's after here is her own physical safety she anticipates Israel's victory and so she's trying to sneak her way into the Israeli camp before she gets wiped out with those who live in Jericho but that's not the case look at the end of verse 11 she says
[time=2397] this and this is the great confession of the Old Testament this is what God was seeking for this is like for us accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and Savior for the Lord
[time=2407] your God he is God in heaven above and on earth beneath that's it that's her profession
[time=2415] of faith that's the moment of her salvation that is what it's that is or maybe at the moment of but that is the essence of her salvation she is revealing there her foundational belief
[time=2425] that the Lord God is the God of all the gods which is exactly what God was trying to establish in the hearts and minds of the pagan nations so they would repent from their false religious systems and turn to him then look at verse 15 she risks her life again then she let down
[time=2444] she let them down by a rope through the window for her house was on the city wall so that she was living on the wall guess who else was on the wall guards guess who else was around the wall guards guess who was on the alert that spies were in their midst guards
[time=2460] all she has to do is be seen lowering some guys in an obvious and precarious way out
[time=2466] of window down a rope and she's again going to be executed but her faith works her faith
[time=2475] works and so she's willing to risk even her own life okay tremendous stories aren't they
[time=2485] absolutely phenomenal stories come on back now to James for a minute James chapter two
[time=2495] and look again at what he's saying now that you have that as a backdrop James two verse twenty one was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son
[time=2506] on the altar well no actually it was Genesis 15 where he believed and was made righteous
[time=2515] that was the justification between he and God what was justified at the moment of offering Isaac was in the eyes of all who could see his faith was real it had works verse 22 you
[time=2528] see that faith was working with his works and as a result of the works faith was perfected meaning faith came to its fullest expression what is real faith do faith works faith works even when it's your own son on the line and you're willing to kill him for the glory of God that's pretty stiff faith verse 23 and the scripture was fulfilled which says this is
[time=2549] back to Genesis 15 a quote from there and Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him his righteousness and he was called the friend of God verse 24 you see that a man
[time=2561] is justified by works and not by faith alone it's an interesting statement verse 24 you
[time=2568] see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone John Calvin said about this verse verse faith alone justifies but the faith that justifies is never alone that's
[time=2581] what I'll put faith alone justifies but the faith that justifies is never alone then now
[time=2589] look at Rahab again verse 25 and in the same way was not Rahab the harlot also justified
[time=2596] by works no and actually in actual reality she was justified by the faith that she expressed
[time=2603] in that great statement about God being superior to all the other gods of the world but that faith gave evidence to humans it could be seen by people when it worked when she received
[time=2615] the messengers and sent them out by another way verse 26 for just as the body without
[time=2625] the spirit is dead so also faith without works is dead and here he is just trying to say
[time=2631] that it is completely inconceivable and unnatural to have a faith that doesn't work just like it is unnatural and odd and eerie and weird to be in the presence of a dead body that
[time=2642] isn't activated by a spirit have you ever been in the presence of a corpse first time
[time=2648] I did that was about twenty five years twenty six years old somewhere back there my wife and I were in the den and my grandfather had died we weren't there for the death but we were there within fifteen or twenty minutes afterwards and he rolled off the couch where he is so often sat and was laying on the floor and we pushed the coffee table away and there he was grandpa the guy that we loved and it is absolutely unbelievable what your mind does began to think and see you can actually see his chest beginning to breathe again wasn't
[time=2680] moving at all it is inconceivable that a body doesn't do what a body does began to feel
[time=2687] like you twitched one of his fingers no twitching no breathing if you've ever been in the presence
[time=2694] of a corpse you understand how unnatural it is for a corpse to just be a corpse because all the bodies you've ever known that are right have somebody in them and they're doing things they're working they're accomplishing things he's saying it's inconceivable to a
[time=2710] conceive of a faith that does not work for just as the body without the spirit is dead
[time=2716] and so also faith without works is dead useless unnatural so in conclusion let me say try
[time=2731] to draw four principles for you just as we wrap this up number one don't miss what James
[time=2738] is saying there is a faith in God a faith in Christ a faith in the scriptures a faith
[time=2744] in the gospels that does not save people from hell there is even the possibility of believing
[time=2753] in God and believing in Christ and all that he did and never be delivered from hell the
[time=2760] demons for example it is a dead faith and it is known and revealed by the absence of
[time=2767] good works it is known and revealed by the absence of good works we are not what we say
[time=2775] we are we are what we do we are not what we say we are we are what we do in other words
[time=2786] if you are sitting here today and you look back on your life to the point that you believe that you made a profession of faith in Jesus Christ and since that point in your life moving this way to the present there is not the habitual growth towards godliness if the good works
[time=2803] that come from a loving heart that's been transformed by the spirit of God are not in your life and increasing in your life then there is absolutely no basis for you to assume
[time=2814] that you are saved despite how many aisles you may have walked how many prayers you may have prayed how many churches you may have joined how many bibles you may own how often you may have prayed if there are no good works in your life and in fact if there is a contradictory message being sent and your life is becoming increasingly sinful there is no hope there
[time=2834] is no assurance that you are saved don't miss that point don't miss that point point
[time=2845] number two it's this kind of stuff that drives me crazy about the grace of God I mean do you
[time=2853] realize we are looking at Abraham a distinguished educated mature leader religiously devote man
[time=2864] and God saves him by grace and we are looking at a prostitute a madam of a brothel who has
[time=2871] been beat and ruined and beaten up in her life I mean and degraded and she is at the bottom
[time=2877] of the social order and the same grace of God comes in through faith and they both are saved and they both prove it by living unbelievably different lives which means that God can
[time=2889] save from the top of the social order to the bottom of the social order there is no partiality with God his grace extends to everyone no matter what you have done in your life no
[time=2900] matter how bad you have been no matter what anybody has done to you the grace of God
[time=2907] can extend to you through faith do you realize do you realize that Rahab coming out of that
[time=2915] point of absolute despair left Jericho was saved in the great battle entered the nation
[time=2924] of Israel eventually married a prince in Israel and became an ancestor to Boaz remember
[time=2932] Ruth and Boaz Boaz an ancestor of a king by the name of David David the ancestor of
[time=2941] the king of kings and Lord of lords Jesus Christ the grace of God do you realize if
[time=2949] you were to turn to Matthew one right now you would see Rahab the harlot's name in the genealogy of Jesus Christ that that polluted degraded womb eventually was part of the process
[time=2960] that gave birth to the person of Jesus Christ unbelievable staggering truth the grace of
[time=2967] God the third thing that struck me don't miss the adventure of obedience don't miss the
[time=2979] adventure of obedience I mean to say this if you don't obey God even in the face of
[time=2985] great confusion loss of loved ones loss of life you never get to see his great personal
[time=2993] deliverance of your life do you realize what happens if Abraham refuses to believe God
[time=3000] and says forget it we're not going to Moriah do you realize what happens if Rahab refuses
[time=3007] to believe God she never gets to see the miraculous way that the whole wall fell down around
[time=3013] the city of Jericho except the one piece of the wall that she lived in she's the only part of all standing if she doesn't believe God and follow him in obedience she'd never
[time=3024] have seen it she'd never have experienced it God is dying to show you his personal power
[time=3031] of deliverance in your life he's longing to show you that and when you step out of obedience
[time=3037] and into disobedience you rob yourself the adventure of seeing God personally come through
[time=3043] for you time and time and time and time again to give you the strength and the encouragement to continue to live for his glory. It's the greatest adventure in life. Heidi and I were
[time=3053] in a very peculiar place for a pastor and his wife on Friday night we were in a bar
[time=3059] actually in New Haven with hundreds of other people and there's a big band and people were
[time=3065] dancing and people were drinking and all those kinds of things and we felt absolutely conspicuous as we pulled the door open and went in but we went in because there was a guy in that band who plays the drums that we had a chance to lead to the Lord two years ago that we'd been discipling ever since and he's been telling me about his band and I've never seen it and he left me a note this week and said New Haven named the bar named the time and that was it I thought by George I better get to know what that band is like so we went over there we
[time=3092] got to meet him there and see him play and we got to meet the people in the band and it was really fun I mean that part of it was exciting but we had some time to kind of like
[time=3103] when he was playing look around and I mean to tell you we must have looked as weird to
[time=3109] them as they did in a sense to us because here were a bunch of people absolutely empty
[time=3116] to the core of their being bouncing around on a dance floor intoxicated finding then with
[time=3125] that intoxication the liberty to do things I don't think they would do in their right mind trying to fill the void and the emptiness of a pointless life a boring pointless life
[time=3139] people live for that stuff and I walked out of there Friday night with Heidi and I said
[time=3145] good night aren't you glad that our life has meaning and purpose and I thought about the elders meaning I was going to the next morning and thinking about the significance of what God has built into my life because he saved me and if I'll just stay obedience this adventure is just going to keep going on and on and on and on until I finally die I don't think I'm ever going to get bored because God always challenges us he tests us he pushes us good
[time=3171] night don't miss the adventure of obedience don't compromise the ways that God wants to touch your life personally as you stay faithful to that obedient path throw yourself
[time=3182] at his will give him what he wants from your life you will never ever be bored the last
[time=3192] one I just want to talk about the significance of obedience the significance of obedience
[time=3199] and I touched on it a little bit here with Rahab but listen to this if you do not obey God even in the face of great confusion loss of loved ones and loss of life you will never
[time=3210] see the way that God wants to use you to build his kingdom if you opt out of obedience then
[time=3218] you opt out of his plan to use you to build his kingdom and you don't get to play the
[time=3224] part and Rahab's name never would have been in Matthew 1 as as part of the lineage of
[time=3239] and God is as committed to using you to build his kingdom as he is was to Abraham and Rahab
[time=3246] you are no less in his mind a crucial viable part of God building his kingdom and you may
[time=3253] never get written up in the scriptures because a lot of people who were worthy of it didn't because there was limited space and these are done now but don't you think for a minute that your faithful obedience will not add up to significant contributions to the kingdom of God to advancing what God is trying to accomplish you you walk out of obedience and in the disobedience and you compromise that quality in your life and then you have to
[time=3278] do what everybody else does in the world and just live for the moment there's a story
[time=3286] told of a reporter who came up to the construction site of St. Paul's Cathedral in London many
[time=3292] many years ago he was doing a story on the building of that great cathedral he said to
[time=3298] a guy there with a bunch of stones in his hands he said what are you doing and the worker said can't you see what I'm doing I'm sticking stones in here to build this thing just more stones all the time just carrying these stones the reporter went to a second worker and said what are you doing and that worker said well I'm learning a living I've got a family a
[time=3320] bunch of children and I'm earning a living he went to the third worker and said what
[time=3326] what are you doing and the third worker said this oh he said I am helping Sir Christopher
[time=3335] Wren build St. Paul's Cathedral there's a little bit of difference in perspective there
[time=3343] isn't there one guy's just sticking stones in a hole one guy's just trying to earn a
[time=3350] living but one guy knows what he's doing he's helping Sir Christopher Wren build one of
[time=3357] the most beautiful cathedrals the world has ever seen what are you doing what are you
[time=3363] doing are you sticking stones in holes are you just trying to make a living or have you
[time=3373] gone above all that stuff and do you recognize that God wants to use you individually and personally and powerfully to help build the kingdom of God and I hope you have a sense
[time=3382] of that because he's committed to it I hope the music was inspiring for you as you listen
