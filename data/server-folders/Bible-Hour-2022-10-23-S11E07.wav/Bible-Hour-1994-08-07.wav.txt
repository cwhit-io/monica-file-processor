[time=0] If we can master our tongue, the rest is easy.
[time=6] If we can control what we say, we can control every other dimension in our life.
[time=23] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=29] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=32] Thank you for joining us.
[time=33] If a Christian asked you for advice on how to best evaluate their quality of spiritual walk with God, what would you say to them?
[time=41] Would you advise them to examine their knowledge of Scripture, the amount of time they spend in prayer, how sacrificial they are in giving to the church?
[time=50] If someone asked me that question, I'd encourage them to take inventory of their speech, to take a close look at what comes out of their mouth when they talk to their friends, their family, people at church, people at work, and even to themselves when no one else is listening.
[time=66] Stay with us this morning as we study what the Bible tells us our tongues can tell us about ourselves.
[time=73] Our special music today will be provided by Gene Cheryl and Becky Wollman.
[time=82] Let's join our service.
[time=88] [MUSIC - 274 seconds]
[time=372] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 211 seconds]
[time=591] (audience applauds)
[time=606] - Well, I hope you've already enjoyed the music from our sanctuary choir.
[time=610] Sing a great and powerful song.
[time=612] Jesus is a strong tower.
[time=614] And the solo by Becky woman entitled God is in control.
[time=618] What wonderful words.
[time=620] Well, today I resigned as the Minister of Music of Blackhawk Baptist Church and the Director of the Bible Hour.
[time=627] I wanna take a moment and share that time when I talk to our church family today.
[time=634] Usually on Sunday mornings I know exactly what people are going to sing.
[time=637] I've heard the song and I didn't know what Becky was gonna sing, but I echo what Pastor Russ just said that God is indeed in control.
[time=648] I submitted my letter of resignation to Pastor Moore last Tuesday, August 2nd, 1994.
[time=655] And you might ask the question, how did Carolyn and I decide to leave after 11 years of ministry here?
[time=663] Well, one thing is certainly God uses prayer to assist us in our decisions, but he also uses other ways to tell us that it's time to move on.
[time=670] Here are some of the factors that I considered in evaluating a possible change.
[time=676] In every ministry there's a flow and or a cycle of events.
[time=682] Carolyn, I feel we have completed many major goals and plans and this invariably leads us to consider the next few years of ministry.
[time=691] Certainly if you've been around and you've seen the choir perform in our orchestra and the handbells and the singers and the soloists, no one could be more pleased as a director and administer of music to see what God has allowed many of our musicians to do in the way of ministry.
[time=708] Seeing their voices develop, I've seen their lives develop and that's most important that they've really, they really shine for the Lord when they minister.
[time=717] As we mature, and I use that word as we mature really as we grow older, that's a better, a real way to put it, I guess.
[time=725] Sometimes God places us in positions of greater responsibilities or at least places us in an area with different responsibilities.
[time=735] God does open new areas of service and we are considering several options.
[time=741] Now our church leaders here at Blackhawk are gearing up for a series of messages explaining the vision for the church.
[time=751] This is a period of time when every member becomes aware of the leadership's desires and having heard the plan and having prayed and examined that plan and all the new opportunities before them, you need to continue to be in prayer for your leaders and you need to support their course of action.
[time=772] First Peter chapter five clearly explains their responsibility to you as the shepherd of the flock.
[time=777] And as you listen and as you hear the exciting events that are coming forward in the next few days and weeks, you need to be praying that God will pull everything together and allow these visions to renew and invigorate Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=794] Ultimately, this is a step of faith.
[time=797] The world calls it, I guess, just really biting the bullet.
[time=803] For us, it's a difficult time.
[time=806] There's no joy in leaving, but it's part of God's calling.
[time=812] The sheep listen to his voice.
[time=814] He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
[time=817] When he has brought out all his own, he goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice.
[time=823] This is what determines the time to move his voice.
[time=828] There'll be a letter coming out next week, a copy of the resignation.
[time=834] It describes in detail my thankfulness a little bit more.
[time=837] Suffice it to say this morning that Caroline did thankful for 11 years of your support, your love and your service to the ministry of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=848] We're praying that God will continue to bless.
[time=851] It's a mighty powerful church.
[time=853] It's known around the country for its strong stand and for its ministry.
[time=857] And I pray that that will continue to be that way.
[time=860] And God bless you as you pray for your leaders and seek new leaders for positions here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=870] Thank you.
[time=870] All of you are such an encouragement to the Bible hour.
[time=876] We really appreciate it when you write in and tell us that you're praying for it.
[time=880] The ministry will continue as strong as ever as Pastor Moore's preaches from the Word of God every Sunday on the Bible hour.
[time=889] Once again, I wanna thank you for your wonderful support of our ministry here and we're so encouraged by you.
[time=895] And I know that even next week as Pastor Moore comes on the insert, he'll share with you some of the exciting and new things that will transpire during this transition time.
[time=905] We wanna go back to the live portion of our service now.
[time=908] And Jean Sherrill's gonna be singing for us.
[time=910] He's a marvelous musician.
[time=912] He has a great testimony in his song and I'm sure it'll be an inspiration to you.
[time=917] If you have an opportunity today, write to the Bible hour at 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana and tell us that you're watching and praying for us.
[time=925] Thank you very much.
[time=953] [MUSIC - 204 seconds]
[time=1162] (audience applauding)
[time=1169] - Thank you, Gene.
[time=1173] Tremendous ministry of music today, we're thankful for the encouragement that it brings to our hearts.
[time=1178] Well, needless to say, it's been a traumatic week.
[time=1182] And in my heart and mind, I've been searching what God would have for me to say today and considered many different things, many different texts.
[time=1192] But as I looked at what was next on our agenda here in the book of James, I concluded that God not only was orchestrating the songs, which are picked nearly six weeks in advance, but the way we come to the sequence of this text, maybe exactly what the Lord would have for us this morning.
[time=1209] So let me invite you to come to James chapter three.
[time=1213] James chapter three, the first 12 verses, is all about the tongue.
[time=1218] It's all about our speech.
[time=1219] It's about how we talk about what we talk about, when we talk about it and who we talk to about it.
[time=1225] It has been a marvelous thing for me to have the privilege of studying this text in the midst of something as heart-wrenching as we've experienced this week.
[time=1235] And I trust that the principles that come from this text will be as helpful to you as they have been to me.
[time=1243] Then I just guess we have a responsibility together to talk rightly about all that is happening.
[time=1251] Let me give you three principles from this passage about the tongue as they come out of James chapter three.
[time=1256] And then at the end of each principle, I'll try to bring a point of application.
[time=1261] The first principle is this.
[time=1262] Number one, if you can master the tongue, the rest is easy.
[time=1275] Look at James chapter three, verse two.
[time=1277] We'll come back to verse one in a minute.
[time=1279] For we all stumble in many ways, and that's just a general confession similar to the one in first John one, which says if we say we have no sin, we are liars.
[time=1287] Even as believers, we are in the process of stumbling from time to time.
[time=1292] We'll continue to stumble all the way into heaven.
[time=1295] It does not mean, as we saw the previous two weeks, that we make a characteristic habitual pattern of sin that characterizes our life.
[time=1302] However, even though we are moving in conformity to the image of Christ, we are still in the process of stumbling and falling in many ways.
[time=1310] And then he says in verse two, if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.
[time=1320] And there's the principle which guards this first point or establishes this first point for us.
[time=1326] And he is saying, if you can learn to control your tongue, if you can use your tongue for the betterment of the body, and for the betterment of your family, and for the betterment of God, and for the betterment of your employer and employees, if you can use your tongue in a way that glorifies God, the rest of your Christian sanctification process is gonna be a piece of cake.
[time=1347] You'll be able to, as it says in the universe two, you'll be able to bridle the whole body as well.
[time=1355] The most difficult part of your body to control is your tongue, because it is always in a position to sin.
[time=1365] That's not true of other sins that we might want to commit.
[time=1369] You may want to steal something from someone, and you're not in a position to do that.
[time=1373] You can't negotiate that situation.
[time=1375] You may have lustful thoughts and want to commit an act of fornication or adultery, but in order to do that, you have to be in a certain place with a certain person.
[time=1383] There is a certain amount of positioning that goes on.
[time=1385] You may want to get drunk.
[time=1387] You may be at work and just would rather be drunk all day, but you can't do that.
[time=1391] There are certain situations that prohibit that, barring you're getting up and leaving, and even that takes some time.
[time=1396] Your tongue is instantly available to the sin in your heart.
[time=1400] It is always available to perform the sin that you want to commit, whether somebody's there to listen to it or not, because God listens all the time.
[time=1408] And so what he is saying is the most difficult part, or aspect of your Christian life, as far as the members of your body are concerned, a control is your tongue, and if you can learn to control your tongue, the rest is under control.
[time=1422] A little bit like the Chinese language.
[time=1425] I've heard from many people that the Chinese language is the most difficult to learn in all the world.
[time=1429] There is no alphabet.
[time=1430] There are just thousands and thousands and thousands of characters that you have to memorize and learn, and then in that character, there are even tonation indicators that you must use when you say the word, or you aren't understood.
[time=1444] It's absolutely a mind-boggling language to try to comprehend.
[time=1447] The point is this, if you can master Chinese, you can master any other language there is.
[time=1452] They're all easier than that one, and that's what this truth is saying.
[time=1456] If you can gain control of your tongue, getting control of your feet and your hands and all the rest of you is going to be relatively simple.
[time=1464] And so he illustrates his point in verse three.
[time=1468] He says, now, if we put the bits into the horse's mouth so that they may obey us, we direct their entire body as well.
[time=1476] You see what he's saying?
[time=1478] You can move the entire movement of a magnificent, strong animal rippling with muscles, a great and mighty stallion who for most intense and practical purposes is out of control.
[time=1491] Once you break him and you stick a bit in his mouth, he becomes your slave.
[time=1496] He'll do anything you want him to do.
[time=1498] And all you have to do is pull on a little leather strap.
[time=1501] And what's connected to the leather strap?
[time=1504] A little piece of metal.
[time=1505] And where is that metal?
[time=1507] That metal is laying across his tongue, a very sensitive part of his body.
[time=1511] And when you pull, it inflicts a little bit of pressure and sometimes pain on that tongue and he does whatever you say.
[time=1517] So the enormity of the strength and the power of this gigantic animal is under your control by simply having control of his tongue.
[time=1529] It's a wonderful illustration.
[time=1530] It gets bigger and more grandiose in the next verse.
[time=1533] He goes on from verse three to verse four to talk about a ship.
[time=1536] Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by strong winds, are still directed by a very small rudder wherever the inclination of the pilot desires.
[time=1548] And this time, it's not the self-willed nature of an animal you're dealing with.
[time=1551] It's the very forces of nature themselves, the enormous winds that would come across the oceans.
[time=1557] And remember, this was written in a day when these ships didn't have engines.
[time=1561] They were themselves dependent upon the wind to move.
[time=1564] They had to throw up a sail.
[time=1566] And so they had to catch the power of the wind.
[time=1570] And so they became, by the mass of the ship, in addition to that, the sails that they would hoist, they were then even more subject to the great and mighty winds that would crash across the oceans and the currents of the water which would go with those winds.
[time=1585] A massive ship against the forces of nature can be controlled by a relatively small part of that ship called the rudder.
[time=1596] And the pilot in charge of that ship, were it not for the rudder, would be absolutely helpless to control this gigantic structure.
[time=1606] In calm water, much less in a storm.
[time=1610] But you give him controls of the rudder and the ship does what he says.
[time=1614] Everything follows.
[time=1616] Everything moves in line.
[time=1618] And we know today that principle is still true, even though ships have grown to sizes which dwarf the ancient ships.
[time=1628] I mean, 5, 6, 7,000 people on aircraft carriers moving cities, carrying hundreds of aircrafts and the fuel and the munitions and the food and the water and the communication processes.
[time=1640] I mean, these things are just absolutely moving cities.
[time=1643] You couldn't budget, save, go to the control room
[time=1650] and sit at the bridge and take a hold of the rudder.
[time=1653] And then this massive moving city, regardless of what the ocean is doing and the winds along with it, just navigates the course you have set.
[time=1663] So it's a tremendous principle.
[time=1666] Power supplied at the right point is sufficient to control the whole vessel.
[time=1672] Speech, your tongue.
[time=1674] If you are capable of controlling your tongue, you can control the rest of your life, the entire course of all the other members of your body.
[time=1683] If your words are only gracious and kind and loving and true and thoughtful and holy and edifying and gentle and comforting and a blessing and full of humility and wisdom and thanksgiving and unselfishness and peaceful words, if that is the characteristic pattern of what is coming out of your mouth, then so will that be the characteristic of your life?
[time=1701] Because you'll have proven an ability to control the most unruly member in your body.
[time=1706] One person I studied this week trying to describe this very principle, talked about the master switch on your electrical board at home.
[time=1716] And you know there are a lot of fuses you can throw, a lot of circuits you can throw, but then there is the master switch.
[time=1722] And if you throw the master switch, it doesn't matter what you do with all the other circuit breakers, because the whole thing is shut down.
[time=1729] And he said your tongue is a lot like the master switch on your electrical board.
[time=1736] If you can throw the master switch, then all the other members of your body are under control.
[time=1741] They are rendered inoperative.
[time=1742] I quote him, he says this, "If our tongue were so well under control "that it refused to formulate the words of self pity, "the images of lustfulness, the thoughts of anger "and resentment, then these things are cut down "before they have a chance to live.
[time=1761] "The master switch has deprived them of any power "to switch on that side of our lives.
[time=1768] "The control of the tongue is more than an evidence "of spiritual maturity, it is also the means to it." That's what I'll put.
[time=1777] And so there's the principle.
[time=1779] If we can control our tongue, we can control the rest of our lives.
[time=1785] Now let me bring this first point of application for the first principle.
[time=1790] Let me invite you to take the next seven days,
[time=1796] just the next seven days.
[time=1797] And let me invite you to remove any other criteria of spirituality in your life, not totally and completely, but let's put your tongue as the centerpiece, the centerpiece of how you're going to evaluate your walk with God this week.
[time=1812] Let it be what really tells you is going on inside of you.
[time=1817] Listen carefully to it and control it.
[time=1823] Don't allow it to speak words that are not gracious and kind and loving and true and thoughtful and holy and edifying and gentle and comforting.
[time=1833] Don't allow it to speak words which are not a blessing to the person who hears them, which are not filled with your own humility and your own wisdom from on high as you've asked for that from God.
[time=1845] Don't let your tongue speak things which are not full of thanksgiving.
[time=1849] Don't let your tongue speak things which are selfish in nature.
[time=1852] And do not let your tongue speak things which are not peaceful.
[time=1855] Speak only those things which edify and unify and build up and strengthen.
[time=1862] Principle number two, principle number two comes down to the next several verses and it's this.
[time=1868] If you fail to master the tongue, the damage is enormous.
[time=1878] If we fail to master our tongues,
[time=1884] the damage can be enormous.
[time=1887] Look at verses five and six.
[time=1889] So also the tongue is a small part of the body and yet it boasts great things.
[time=1893] Yeah, it's little, all right, but man can it do a number.
[time=1897] Behold the universe five, how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire.
[time=1903] And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity.
[time=1907] The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life and is set on fire by hell.
[time=1916] Whew, that's a tremendous powerful illustration.
[time=1920] I mean, James hung around his half-brother, the Lord, and watched him teach over and over and over again.
[time=1925] And if you'll read the gospels, you'll see the Lord coming up with illustration after illustration after illustration.
[time=1930] And so we recognize this peculiar strength in the life of James, probably because he watched his half-brother do this all of his life, even before the public ministry.
[time=1940] So what is the illustration?
[time=1943] It's like, consider the end of verse five.
[time=1945] Behold, how great a forest is set aflame by such a small fire in vision, if you will, the most beautiful forest you've ever seen with flowers and a brook running through it and gorgeous meadows and marvelous trees that reach to the sky full of all the wildlife that our Lord would populate one of his forests with.
[time=1965] It's just enormous, and it's taken years and years and years and years and years to build.
[time=1972] And then bring in one little lonely spark.
[time=1978] One little piece of fire.
[time=1981] And let it catch ahold of something combustible, some dry grass on the perimeter, some pine needles that have fallen long ago with some leaves that have been there and are very dry at this time of the year.
[time=1996] And watch that little spark turn into a raging forest fire which devastates the entire thing.
[time=2003] Burns up every bush, burns up every tree, destroys many of the animals and if humans get caught in the way, they're destroyed as well and leaves nothing but a charred mass.
[time=2013] In 1871, Mrs. O'Leary's barn, you remember?
[time=2019] There was one little lonely spark that apparently one of her cows created.
[time=2024] And before it was all done, 17,500 buildings in the city of Chicago had gone up in smoke.
[time=2032] 300 people were dead, 125,000 people were left homeless and in 1871, they estimated the damages to be at $400 million.
[time=2043] One spark, one spark.
[time=2047] That is so different, for example, than water.
[time=2050] To take a little cup of water and tip it over, it doesn't eventually turn into a great tidal way that destroys a city.
[time=2057] There's no self-propagating nature to it.
[time=2059] But there is with fire and there is with our tongues.
[time=2063] And so we say to ourselves, this one little insignificant comment that the Holy Spirit is saying to me, "Don't say, don't say." But it's such a juicy morsel and it seems to flow so easily off my tongue and what can it hurt?
[time=2080] I know the person I'm talking to and it's just a little sentence.
[time=2086] And James is saying, "Be careful.
[time=2088] "Don't underestimate the nature of the beast.
[time=2093] "Don't forget you're playing with fire "and it has, if it finds combustible material, "the opportunity to propagate itself "and tear and shred and ruin." Don't underestimate the power of your tongue.
[time=2106] Morgan Blake, a sports writer for the Atlanta Journal, wrote this, "I am more deadly than the screaming shell "of the howitzer.
[time=2116] "I win without killing.
[time=2118] "I tear down homes, break hearts and wreck lives.
[time=2122] "I travel on the wings of the wind.
[time=2125] "No innocence is strong enough to intimidate me.
[time=2129] "No purity pure enough to don't me.
[time=2131] "I have no regard for truth, no respect for justice, "no mercy for the defenseless.
[time=2136] "My victims are as numerous as the sands of the sea "and often as innocent.
[time=2142] "I never forget and seldom forgive.
[time=2146] "My name is gossip." Proverbs 16, 27 says, "A worthless man "digs up evil while his words are a scorching fire.
[time=2157] "His words are a scorching fire.
[time=2159] "Nowhere in recent world history "would this better be illustrated "than out of the mouth of one Adolf Hitler, "who through his tongue ignited a world war." Just part of it, listen to one of his quotes, "Nothing will prevent me from tearing Christianity apart, "root and branch.
[time=2179] "We are not out against the 101 different kinds "of Christianity.
[time=2183] "We are out against Christianity itself.
[time=2186] "All people who profess creeds are traitors to my people.
[time=2191] "Even those Christians who really want to serve the people, "we must suppress.
[time=2197] "He concludes, "I myself am a heathen to the core.
[time=2201] "And out of this man's mouth pours the sparks "which ignited World War II and the eventual death "and incineration of some six million Jews." Of course, not all of them were incinerated.
[time=2217] Many of them were just buried, but they all died just the same.
[time=2220] He started a forest fire that went around the world.
[time=2225] And you can go to Europe today and see the absolute devastation of this man's ability to talk.
[time=2230] Don't underestimate your tongue.
[time=2235] The shattering, terrifying reality is the same tongue is in our heads.
[time=2239] We are capable of the same kinds of things.
[time=2243] Look at verse six, a couple of phrases I just want to highlight for you.
[time=2250] The tongue is a fire.
[time=2251] It says this, the very world of iniquity.
[time=2255] The very world of iniquity.
[time=2257] Directly or indirectly, the scriptures refer to the following with respect to the tongue.
[time=2263] Listen to the world of iniquity.
[time=2265] That your tongue can tap.
[time=2266] The Bible talks about a wicked tongue, a deceitful tongue, a lying tongue, a perverse tongue, a filthy tongue, a corrupt tongue, a bitter tongue, an angry tongue, a flattering tongue, a slanderous tongue,
[time=2280] a gossiping tongue, a backbiting tongue, a blasphemous tongue, a foolish tongue, a boasting tongue, a murdering, complaining, cursing, contentious, sensual, vile tongue, the tail-bearing tongue, the whispering tongue, and the exaggerating tongue.
[time=2295] There it is, all the world of iniquity bound up in God's word, finding its expression through the tongue.
[time=2303] Not only is your tongue able to sin instantly, it can sin in any type of area.
[time=2308] It can cross boundaries of sin in an instant.
[time=2311] If you can think it, and if you can have it in your heart, your tongue can express it.
[time=2314] No wonder God put our tongue in a cage with teeth for bars walled in by our mouths.
[time=2323] Remember, your tongue is in a wet place.
[time=2327] It can slip very, very easily.
[time=2330] It can touch every person in your life.
[time=2335] You see at the universe six, it sets on fire the course of your life, and is set on fire by hell.
[time=2341] When you begin to articulate things, you set on fire the course of your own life, and it can touch not only your own life, but everybody else in your life, your whole network of friends.
[time=2353] Don't underestimate the power of the tongue.
[time=2357] Let me give you a point of application for the second principle.
[time=2362] It comes out of Proverbs 26.20, I'll read it to you.
[time=2366] Proverbs 26.20 says this.
[time=2368] For lack of wood, the fire goes out.
[time=2377] And where there is no whisper contention quiets down.
[time=2384] What's he saying?
[time=2385] Be a fire break.
[time=2389] Out in California, where we're from, it becomes very, very dry.
[time=2394] Very, very dry.
[time=2395] You've read in the newspapers not too long ago of the enormous fires that can run across California like a bunch of wild horses.
[time=2405] And what they have to do is they have to build fire breaks.
[time=2410] They take these big tractors from the fire department and they scrape the land all the way down to the dirt so that no growth grows and they cut great swaths through the dry brush.
[time=2424] Distances they hope the fire will not leap.
[time=2427] And so the fire burns a certain section and it comes to the place where there's nothing else to burn because the ground itself is just dirt.
[time=2435] And where that occurs, the fire stops and dies and goes out and does no more damage.
[time=2441] If on the other hand, the fire can leap the fire break then thousands of new acres can be destroyed and homes and people can die and animals can be consumed.
[time=2452] For lack of wood, the fire goes out.
[time=2460] Put some fires out.
[time=2461] Be a fire break.
[time=2464] Resolve in your heart that as you hear malicious or untrue or harmful or things which do not edify the body or edify your family or edify whatever situation it is at work.
[time=2477] Wherever you are when you hear the untrue or the negative or maybe it's even true but it's not helpful, be a fire break.
[time=2484] Stop it dead in its tracks.
[time=2486] Say there's no wood here, you'll just have to die right there.
[time=2490] You'll just have to extinguish yourself.
[time=2495] Principle number three, principle number three.
[time=2498] If you will master your tongue, you must first master your heart.
[time=2514] Look at verse seven here for a minute.
[time=2520] For every species of beast and birds, of reptiles and creatures of the sea is tamed and has been tamed by the human race.
[time=2527] All you can do is think of the zoo or think of Shamu or Lassie or Flipper or Elephants and Falcons.
[time=2532] I mean, you name it, we can tame it.
[time=2534] You name it and we can get it to basically do what we want it to do.
[time=2538] We can get it to act contrary to what it is.
[time=2540] It's wild by nature.
[time=2543] But we can do certain things that control and in a way tame the wildness right out of that beast.
[time=2552] But, he says in verse eight, no one can tame the tongue.
[time=2556] It is a restless evil and full of deadly poison.
[time=2560] You can't tame the tongue.
[time=2562] What do we mean by this?
[time=2565] If you have anger in your heart, you can count on it coming out.
[time=2571] There's nothing you're gonna be able to do to keep the anger in your heart for coming out of your lips to somebody at some time if no one other than God himself.
[time=2581] Your tongue is nothing more than an errand boy.
[time=2583] And he goes faithfully every time to the same place for his messages, your heart.
[time=2590] And whatever is in your heart, he faithfully delivers.
[time=2593] Your tongue is like a bucket.
[time=2596] And your bucket gets lowered down into the well and whatever's in the well, good water or bad water, it brings up and then pours it out.
[time=2604] Whatever is in your heart will eventually come out.
[time=2609] Matthew 12 records our Lord speaking on this issue.
[time=2613] The mouth speaks out of that which fills the heart.
[time=2616] Now watch, the good man out of his good treasure brings forth what is good.
[time=2621] The evil man out of his evil treasure brings forth what is evil?
[time=2626] If there's anger or contention or lustfulness or theft
[time=2633] or greed or whatever it is, if it's in your heart, you can count on your tongue being a faithful errand boy, a faithful water bucket, it will deliver what's there.
[time=2643] So you cannot tame your tongue.
[time=2644] You cannot hold those things in your heart and successfully keep them from being expressed.
[time=2649] Your heart is a little bit like a volcano.
[time=2651] And eventually what's under there gets under such pressure that no matter how hard you have tried to compress it and wall it up and keep it from coming out, it will eventually come out.
[time=2662] You cannot tame your tongue.
[time=2664] All you can do is change your heart so that what comes out of your heart represents your praise and your worship and your thanksgiving for God.
[time=2673] Do you understand?
[time=2674] Do not try to fight the battle at the level of your tongue, fight the battle at the level of your heart because that's the only possible hope for success.
[time=2685] He illustrates this.
[time=2685] Look at verses nine and 10.
[time=2687] Verse nine says with it we bless our Lord and Father
[time=2693] and with it we curse men who have been made in the likeness of God.
[time=2697] From the same mouth come both blessing and cursing, my brethren, these things ought not to be this way.
[time=2703] In verse nine he says we can bless our Father with our tongue and at the same time or a slightly different time we can use the same tongue to curse men who have been made in the likeness of God.
[time=2714] How does that work in your life?
[time=2717] I tell you how it works in my life.
[time=2719] When I am thankful for all that God is doing for His great magnanimous salvation and for my kids and my wife and my home and my church and all the things that are going, when I am thankful for that in my heart you can't keep me from talking about it.
[time=2733] It comes out.
[time=2734] When on the other hand I am not thankful with what God is doing.
[time=2740] When I am angry at God for what He is doing you can find me cursing men now not with real cuss words so to speak but you can find me tearing people down because that is what is in my heart.
[time=2752] He's saying this ought not to be this way.
[time=2757] You have a new heart, a redeemed heart, a cleansed heart.
[time=2762] You are in fact new in your relationship with Christ.
[time=2765] It ought to be the consistent expression of your heart only to have the blessing for your Lord and Father not the cursing for men.
[time=2771] Then he illustrates it.
[time=2776] Having talked about how it works in people he talks about how it works in nature.
[time=2778] Look at verses 11 and 12.
[time=2780] Does a fountain send forth from the same opening both fresh and bitter water?
[time=2784] No.
[time=2785] Can a fig tree my brother and produce olives or a vine produce figs?
[time=2790] No.
[time=2790] Not unless I plant it then it produces nothing.
[time=2794] Neither can salt water produce fresh.
[time=2799] You see what he's saying?
[time=2800] He's saying wait a minute.
[time=2802] Your heart is new.
[time=2803] Your heart has been set for God.
[time=2805] You have vowed to God at the point of your salvation he can have your life.
[time=2808] He can do anything he wants with it.
[time=2810] And coming to find his forgiveness you've been so overwhelmed by his grace and his mercy that you lay your life down Romans 12 as a living sacrifice to God.
[time=2819] That is the heart of a Christian.
[time=2821] That is the essence of what it means to be saved.
[time=2823] Take me, use me, whatever it is, I'm yours.
[time=2826] I'm just so thankful for your salvation and for the eternal life which is mine in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2831] Now that's the heart.
[time=2833] But when we lose track of that and when we allow the demandingness to come in and the anger and the bitterness and the critical spirit and the lustful heart and the covetousness and all the things that are uncharacteristic of the Christian human heart we then produce something which is inconsistent with what we truly are.
[time=2851] And he's saying nature doesn't do that.
[time=2853] Why would you?
[time=2855] Learn from nature.
[time=2857] Nature only produces consistently what it is and you're new in Christ and you submitted to Christ.
[time=2862] Now consistently produce things which are consistent with that submission.
[time=2867] So the only way to work on your tongue is to work on your heart.
[time=2873] So if we can master our tongue
[time=2881] we can master the rest of our Christian lives.
[time=2885] The great criteria by which we should be evaluating ourselves first and foremost is what is actually coming out of my mouth because it finds a direct link to what is in our hearts.
[time=2896] And we can focus on that as a point of evaluation and we can even spend the next seven days to get a really clear reading on the true condition of our heart before God.
[time=2905] Secondly, we learn that if we are going to master the tongue
[time=2913] we must, we absolutely must, understand its potential to do damage.
[time=2921] We cannot excuse ourselves.
[time=2925] We cannot make exceptions for ourselves.
[time=2927] We cannot underestimate the power of the tongue to do damage.
[time=2931] We must respect it as a highly volatile, flammable material, a concealed weapon so to speak that can kill at a distance.
[time=2941] People we don't even know are getting hurt by it, can be hurt by it because it travels from one to the next.
[time=2947] And so there must be a great sense of awe and respect for this little thing in our mouth.
[time=2955] And then we understand that if we are ever going to have success at mastering this tongue, we must master our hearts.
[time=2961] The tongue reveals to us the condition of our hearts so faithfully and we then go to work with God in heart surgery to cut out what might remain of anything short of an attitude that glorifies God.
[time=2979] So the point of application here, it's rather obvious, work on your heart, work on your heart.
[time=2986] Begg God for your heart, make it soft, though it may be sorrowful, make it soft, though it may be confused, make it soft, though it may not know all the answers, let it speak that which builds up and edifies.
[time=3003] Work on your heart.
[time=3005] I know that's been a tremendous point of effort for me.
[time=3013] Throughout my entire Christian life, I can hear myself say things and just want a cringe for what it reveals about my heart.
[time=3022] And there have been times where I have said, well, I'm not going to say that again or I'm never going to get in a conversation like that again.
[time=3029] And within a little while, I'm in one again because I never dealt with my heart.
[time=3033] But by God's grace as we find some success with our hearts,
[time=3040] then suddenly the tongue is just responding to that and you can look back and say, my, there's been some growth there.
[time=3046] My heart must be a little closer to God than it was before.
[time=3051] Charles Wesley provides a great closing for us today.
[time=3058] In light of this whole theme of the book of James, people thinking they're saved and not saved.
[time=3064] Charles Wesley, you know the great pastor and hymn writer who wrote and published over 6,000 hymns, many of which are our favorites.
[time=3073] Charles Wesley was 30 years old and ordained pastor, minister of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3079] When it dawned on him, he wasn't saved.
[time=3081] He was struggling with enormous unrest in his heart as we read his diary, though ordained minister, though a brilliant scholar yet unsaved.
[time=3090] Though believing the Bible and really all that was in the Bible, believing the full confession of creed convinced to the truth of the gospel, but not having it really experienced in his own life.
[time=3102] And being painfully aware of this, he went to his Bible and studied Galatians 220, which says, the son of God loved me and gave himself for me.
[time=3112] The son of God loved me and gave himself for me.
[time=3116] And Charles Wesley then was studying with the help of Martin Luther who had written a commentary on that very book, Galatians, and he was reading about that particular verse.
[time=3126] And Luther instructed the reader to dwell long and hard on the little word me in Galatians 220, the son of God loved me and gave himself for me.
[time=3138] And Charles Wesley meditated on that truth over and over and over and through the night hours.
[time=3144] And finally, before it was done, was convinced that he had been born again, that his faith was real and true and genuine.
[time=3151] That he had been found and saved by God.
[time=3156] One year later, after a vibrant year of ministry with his brother, who also was saved a few days later, great evangelists moving up and down the area in which they ministered.
[time=3168] One year later, to celebrate the anniversary of his conversion, he wrote, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing, "my great redeemers praise.
[time=3178] "The glories of my God and King, "the triumphs of his grace." And Charles Wesley in this marvelous hymn is complaining against the limitations of his own anatomy.
[time=3192] He's saying one tongue isn't enough to say and to sing what is in my heart out of gratitude for my great redeemer and the mercies that he has given me and his faithfulness to me.
[time=3201] I wish, oh, I wish I could have a thousand tongues and a thousand mouths so that I by myself could be a thousand voice choir and somehow begin to adequately express my gratitude for my great redeemer.
[time=3217] For the glories of my God and King, for the triumphs of his grace.
[time=3221] My friend, if we're gonna use our tongues, may they be with that aspiration in mind.
[time=3228] May they be with the understanding that God is committed to using us in great and mighty ways and he has given us tongues to perpetuate that process and to strengthen that process.
[time=3244] But that very tongue represents the potential for enormous, almost incalculable damage.
[time=3250] And so we submit ourselves a fresh and anew to use it in a way that brings glory and honor to him.
[time=3257] Let's pray to God.
[time=3259] Father, we thank you for this service together.
[time=3269] Our hearts are heavy, we are confused, we don't know all that you have for us in the days ahead.
[time=3279] We confess even as Becky saying, the fundamental belief in our Christianity being your absolute control of all that is.
[time=3289] You are the beginning and the end.
[time=3290] You are the great I am.
[time=3292] You were before there was.
[time=3294] Nothing catches you by surprise.
[time=3296] Nothing takes you off guard.
[time=3299] All things work together in your sovereign plan for good to those who love you and to those who are called according to your purpose.
[time=3305] And we believe that we are among those in that category.
[time=3309] And so we will labor and endeavor to support one another in the midst of all of this.
[time=3315] We will labor to glorify you with the use of our tongue and let it be known that you have the control of all the rest of our bodies.
[time=3324] We ask that you would empower us for such purposes.
[time=3328] Help us with our hearts, help us to respond rightly to you, to draw upon the biblical principles we've known in days past for days of testing and trial, to let our Christianity flourish and thrive.
[time=3341] Even as the faith and saints of old have always thrived under the trial.
[time=3349] Well, thank you in praise and in Christ's name.
[time=3353] [AMEN] (gentle music)

[time=3428] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm really thankful that I can come and pray to you today and tell you that I'm really sorry for the sins that I've committed.
