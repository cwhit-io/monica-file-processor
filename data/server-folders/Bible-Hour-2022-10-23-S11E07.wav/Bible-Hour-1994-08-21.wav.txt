[time=0] And he is saying there is one fundamental component that separates the desert of people's lives
[time=8] from the oasis of people's lives, and that is this one simple thing, the wisdom that
[time=14] comes from God.
[time=28] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=36] Thank you for joining us.
[time=37] The Bible teaches there are two kinds of wisdom.
[time=41] One is earthly, natural, and demonic.
[time=43] The other is pure, peaceable, and from above.
[time=46] And today in our continuing study of the book of James, Pastor Moore, we'll discuss both types of wisdom and we'll offer helpful insights to assist you in determining which one is
[time=57] operating in your life.
[time=59] Our special music today will be provided by Scott Schindler and Cindy Sherrill.
[time=67] Let's join our service.
[time=77] I have a friend who knows the right way to go.
[time=81] When I'm in his presence, he sets my heart a glow.
[time=85] He's the living way, the truth, the light I know, I wanna walk every day with my Lord.
[time=93] I wanna walk every step of the way, close by the sun, every hour of the day, I wanna
[time=103] walk every day with my Lord.
[time=118] I don't want to take a little stroll out in there.
[time=122] Be known to my Lord as just a fair weather friend.
[time=127] When someone looks at me, they might catch a glimpse of him.
[time=130] I wanna walk every day with my Lord.
[time=135] I wanna walk every step of the way, close by the sun, every hour of the day, I wanna
[time=145] know that we are in watercolor, walk every day with my Lord.
[time=155] I wanna walk every step of the way, close by the sun.
[time=160] Every hour of the day, I wanna know that we are in watercolor, even on Monday, Tuesday,
[time=172] Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I wanna walk, talk, sing, pray.
[time=190] Even on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Saturday, Saturday, Sunday,
[time=199] pray, talk, sing, pray, I wanna walk every day with my Lord.
[time=220] [APPLAUSE]
[time=250] [MUSIC - 196 seconds]
[time=476] [APPLAUSE]
[time=484] Hello and welcome and thank you for joining us today on the Bible Hour.
[time=488] We're very excited about having you with us and I wanna share a few things with you today that are on my heart.
[time=495] The first of which is an exciting new vision that we're building here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=500] About two years ago, I began to meet with our elders and our deacons to discuss the specific vision that our church would have for its future, maybe in the next ten years.
[time=510] And it's been a wonderful and very fruitful time with these men as we have sat around God's Word and examined our mission statement and how we could be more effective in accomplishing the task which God has given us here in the city of Fort Wayne and really around the world.
[time=524] And I'm happy to announce to you that starting September 11th, I'm gonna begin a ten week series from our pulpit about our vision and where we believe God is leading us and the energy and the direction that we have to seek to serve him in the days to come.
[time=539] And so for starting September 11th, for the next ten weeks, we'll be covering this with you and it will be somewhat of a personal time for our church, but much of our commitment and desire comes from the Word of God.
[time=552] And so we think you'll also be encouraged and edified and even instructed as to the mission and the purpose of the church in general, but there will also be some specifics about how we're hoping to pull that off in our own church here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=566] And as you view these things, I just encourage you to be in prayer for our church and undergird us in the ministry that we believe God has given us.
[time=574] And so we'll anticipate a wonderful time to share that with you and hope it will be an encouragement to you as well.
[time=580] I'm also very excited about a special event coming up, really tonight, August 28th in our evening service at six o'clock.
[time=588] We have the privilege of saying farewell to Pastor Kobe and his lovely wife Carol.
[time=593] As you know, they've been ministering with us here at Black Hawk Baptist Church for 11 years.
[time=597] They've been fruitful years of wonderful ministry building up the living Christmas tree, building up the Bible hour and building up the people of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=606] I want to invite you to come to that tonight.
[time=608] You're more than welcome.
[time=609] We're going to have the whole evening service dedicated as a farewell service to them.
[time=614] Inside this service, there'll be a number of wonderful things.
[time=617] As you know, Peter is a part of our quartet and they'll be singing and they'll be testimonies from people who have been ministered to by Peter and Carol.
[time=626] They'll be sharing their hearts.
[time=628] We'll have a special music package throughout the evening.
[time=631] Various people.
[time=632] Scott Schindler is going to do a piano solo in Peter's honor as well as some other wonderful numbers.
[time=638] And I don't think it's a night you would want to miss.
[time=640] The main thing is we don't want you to feel like you're not invited.
[time=643] We want to encourage you.
[time=644] Even if you're not a member of Black Hawk Baptist Church, if you've watched the Bible hour and you've appreciated Peter's ministry, you're invited.
[time=651] We encourage you to come.
[time=653] After the service, which we think will be about an hour and a half long, about 7.30 will begin a reception with punch and cookies and coffee, and you're invited to stay for that as well.
[time=662] So please don't stay away if you would like to express your love and your support for Peter and Carol and for all that they have done the wonderful ministry that they've had.
[time=671] So we encourage you to be a part of that as well.
[time=674] Also, we want you to know that we've got a telephone address book in celebration of the 25 years of ministry of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=683] We'd love to send you one if you're interested in receiving one just right us here at the Bible hour.
[time=688] Absolutely free of charge.
[time=689] It may serve not only as a helpful address book to you, but also as a reminder to pray for us and for the outreach of our television ministry.
[time=698] We're excited about what God is doing through the Bible hour. We're thankful for the many of you who support us on a monthly basis through the Founders Club and what a joy it is to know we finished this year in the Black again and that's possible through your gifts.
[time=711] We'd love for you to continue to be partners with us and to pray for us regularly.
[time=716] Well, at this time we'll go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our service. We're going to join back into the service as Cindy Cheryl sings a wonderful song of God's truth and how faithful he has been to us.
[time=731] I know God has been faithful to you as well and I know as she sings this song you'll be able to reflect upon the years of our wonderful Lord's ministry in your life.
[time=740] From there we'll turn back to our study in the book of James, James chapter three and look at the wisdom of God and we trust it'll minister to your heart. Thank you.
[time=751] [MUSIC]
[time=776] The stars, I hear the rolling thunder, thy power throughout, the universe displayed, then sings my song. I say to God to me, how great the heart, how great the heart, how great the heart.
[time=805] Then sings my song. I say to God to me, how great the heart, how great the heart, how great the heart.
[time=822] And when I hear that there is a night scary, sent him to die, my scarce can take it in.
[time=838] Let on the cross, my garden will be buried, keep letting God to take away my sin.
[time=854] And when Christ shall come, we shall go back to patience, and to take away my choice, and to live my heart.
[time=871] Then I shall bow, with the blood of Rachel, when they are asleep, oh God, I hear the heart, this sings my song. I say to God to me, how great the heart, how great the heart.
[time=900] How great the heart can take my heart, my sacred love, and I say to God, how great the heart, how great the heart, how great the heart.
[time=923] How great the heart, how great the heart.
[time=953] Thank you, Cindy. What a tremendous song that is.
[time=961] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning, and let's come to James chapter 3. We're going to continue in our study of this book.
[time=968] It's an exciting passage. James chapter 3 verses 13 to 18.
[time=973] And to be honest with you, as I was thinking about how to kind of teach this week, my preference would have been to charter 16.
[time=982] There were 60 buses. It was really nice kind to have air conditioning and individualized seats.
[time=987] And right about now they'd be pulling up in our driveway, and we would be exiting this place, and we'd be getting on these buses, and we'd head over to 469 and down to the airport.
[time=996] And we'd arrive there, there would be like 6 or 7, we'd need that many.
[time=1000] 6 or 7, 747s. Just waiting for us. The engines would be on, the gates would be down, we'd be hustling up, we'd be getting sodas and nuts and all the things you like.
[time=1010] And we'd lock that thing up and we'd take off. And we'd head west.
[time=1015] In fact, you know where. We'd head to California.
[time=1021] And on our way we'd be coming over to Nevada, and you'd look out your window and you'd see this vast desert wasteland.
[time=1028] Just as dry as a dead bone. I mean there's nothing but sand and rocks and some lizards and a few cactus.
[time=1037] And there's just nothing going out there. Then we'd cut across into California, and the pilots say out your right window is Death Valley, and you'd look down there and be more desolate wasteland.
[time=1048] And then we'd come over to a place called, actually called Devil's Playground, because it's so desolate.
[time=1054] But then we'd be close.
[time=1057] Off in the distance you'd see this green oasis in the middle of the desert, not the ocean yet.
[time=1063] So hundreds of miles from there, this oasis.
[time=1066] And you'd see palm trees rising out of the desert and green grass and big lakes and ponds and pools and tennis courts.
[time=1075] Did I already say golf courses? And golf courses and five star hotels rising up out of this desolate land.
[time=1084] And we'd land right there at Palm Springs Airport.
[time=1088] And then more charter buses would come. And they would haul us into the heart of Palm Springs, a place called the Grand Champion Hotel, which is a big five star hotel, eighteen whole golf course.
[time=1098] Gorgeous pool where all of us would lounge about. We'd all just check in and I'd just say charge it.
[time=1103] Just charge it. You want it? Just charge it. Because I'm just making this story up anyway, and it doesn't matter what you do.
[time=1110] And then it'd be time for our message.
[time=1115] And you guys would have changed into something much more comfortable than you're in right now.
[time=1118] And we would have put some grandstands out right on the edge of the golf course.
[time=1124] Because as soon as you get off the course it turns into desert, absolute barren desert.
[time=1130] And I put one foot on the golf course and the other foot in the desert.
[time=1135] And I would try to teach you this passage because it is the most powerful graphic illustration of the truth in this passage that I can think of.
[time=1144] Do you realize there's only one component, one basic component that turns that desert into the oasis of Palm Springs?
[time=1153] It's called water.
[time=1156] Without the water that they ship down from Northern California through what they call the California Aqueduct,
[time=1162] which is this cement river that they've carved out of the earth that runs from Northern California all the way down to Southern California
[time=1168] and even out into the desert where Palm Springs is.
[time=1171] It's a river about 15 feet wide and about 8 feet deep and it just brings in this life-giving water.
[time=1177] And you can turn anything into an oasis if you can connect to the California Aqueduct.
[time=1183] James is talking about not landscape, he's talking about people's lives.
[time=1189] And he is saying there are two kinds of lives that people live in this world.
[time=1194] One of them is like a desert, one of them is just a wasteland of fruitlessness and dirt and sand and rocks and lizards and cactus.
[time=1205] I mean there's just nothing going, nothing bearing fruit in this person's life.
[time=1210] And there's another kind of life.
[time=1212] That's an oasis, a relational oasis and it's full of goodness and peace and purity and fruitfulness.
[time=1219] And there's one component that separates those two kinds of lives.
[time=1224] One component that you can interject into the lifeless, barren, fruitless life of the desert lifestyle.
[time=1232] Not water, wisdom, the wisdom of God, the wisdom that comes from God.
[time=1240] And you know, maybe you don't, James was writing to an Old Testament group of people, Jews who knew the Old Testament very well.
[time=1247] So he doesn't tell us a lot about wisdom.
[time=1250] But in the Old Testament, the beginning of wisdom is the fear of God, which means to come to Christ.
[time=1255] It means to get saved.
[time=1256] When you had the beginning of wisdom in the Old Testament, it was the fear of God which meant you worshiped God and God alone.
[time=1262] And then wisdom went on through the rest of the Old Testament to describe.
[time=1265] Once you have that relationship with God, you live every moment of your life according to his word.
[time=1271] That's wisdom.
[time=1273] Old Testament wisdom, as it is in this passage, is not knowledge.
[time=1277] It's not facts.
[time=1278] It's not being able to get that once a year, moody Bible quiz and get all the answers right.
[time=1282] It's not data about the Bible.
[time=1284] It's the ability to take the knowledge of God and the knowledge of his word and apply it effectively to the relationships in your life that produce harmony and unity and peace and purity.
[time=1296] And the wholesome thing we know as Christian community.
[time=1300] In fact, the word wisdom in the Old Testament was used of those men who were chosen because of their unique giftedness to work in the temple.
[time=1309] And they would craft the gold and they would craft the wood and they would make the garments that would adorn the temple of old.
[time=1316] And they were called wise men because they were skillful with their hand.
[time=1320] Wisdom in the spiritual sense is skillful living according to the knowledge of God.
[time=1333] And that's what this chapter, this is what this little paragraph is about.
[time=1336] He wants you to understand that if you will live in the wisdom of God, your life can become an oasis fruitful and plush and inviting and refreshing.
[time=1349] At the same time, if you draw from a different source, if you draw from not heavenly wisdom but earthly wisdom, your life becomes barren and dry and hot and scorched and fruitless, a veritable wasteland.
[time=1365] Let's look at how he sets this thing up. In verse 13, he gets us into the discussion by raising a question, who among you is wise and understanding?
[time=1376] Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his good behavior his deeds in gentleness of wisdom.
[time=1382] That should ring a little bit of a bell. He's saying if you think you have wisdom, if you think you're wise, if you're going to answer that rhetorical question by saying I do, I have wisdom, I have understanding.
[time=1393] He says in response, show it to me by your good behavior and your deeds of gentleness.
[time=1399] Remember James 2 18, the discussion of true living faith and he's going to say there, if you say you have saving faith, no problem, but I'm not going to believe you because you've told me, I want to see the product of that faith in your life.
[time=1413] Same exact argument, I mean the format in the argument, he raises the issue, do you have wisdom? You want to say yes to that? He says don't tell me about it, show it to me.
[time=1423] And so the next remaining verses contrast, human wisdom, the desert, the barren conditions that human wisdom produces verses 14, 15 and 16 with the oasis, the relational oasis of the wisdom of God, the fruit that it bears, so that we can have no question in our minds
[time=1448] as to which wisdom is guiding and leading and directing us.
[time=1453] So with that as an overview, let's look at this first main point, verses 14, 15 and 16, the desert, the absolute desert of earthly wisdom.
[time=1460] And he's going to break it down into three parts, we're going to learn about the motive behind earthly wisdom, the source of earthly wisdom, and then the product, what it produces.
[time=1469] First the motive, look at verse 14, but if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, do not be arrogant and so lie against the truth.
[time=1480] Where is it, it's in your heart, he's talking about the motive, he's talking about the driving passion behind earthly wisdom, and he describes it as bitter jealousy and selfish ambition.
[time=1492] Bitter jealousy, jealousy is the attitude that you get, it's the motive in your heart, whenever you feel threatened, whenever somebody's going to move into your territory or take your space or diminish your glory or work on your honor, and they're going to take something away from you, jealousy is the thing inside your heart that says over my dead body, over my dead body.
[time=1513] And it's described as bitter jealousy, bitter is a word that in the original language described a water you couldn't drink, it was too bitter, I mean it adds a flavor to this jealousy that is biting and bitter and angry, and you're committed to maintaining your personal place in the sun, and anybody who threatens it is in trouble with you.
[time=1534] That's part of this motive, he also calls it selfish ambition, which is needing little explanation, you are in this thing for you, your wisdom has you at the center of all your decisions, your personal gratification, your personal gain, your personal fulfillment, it's all about you.
[time=1552] Maintaining your place for your honor, for your glory to keep what you want, maintaining your territory, your accomplishments, your reputation so you can get what you want.
[time=1562] There's the motive, and I just want to briefly explain these verses to you, and then come back with a current illustration right at a time magazine, the most recent issue, to try to put a spotlight on what he's saying here.
[time=1573] So we'll move now to the source, look at verse 15, where does this wisdom come from?
[time=1579] This wisdom is not that which comes from above, it is three things, earthly, natural, and demonic.
[time=1587] Earthly simply means finite, it means confined to space and time.
[time=1593] That's strengthened by this notion that it's natural, which means it's not supernatural, there's no giving of it from on high, it is brought out of the natural world around you, and it's interjected by the demonic influence.
[time=1608] Which would have you worship the natural thing, right? Demons are always trying to get us to worship the creature rather than the creator, they want us to worship idols and they want us to worship mountains and sun and moon.
[time=1620] So it is a wisdom that is confined to the finite dimensions of this earth that produces a longing for the things of this earth.
[time=1630] It's a very contained system. Thirdly, what does it produce? Verse 16, for where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, two things, there is disorder, secondly, every evil thing.
[time=1645] Disorder is a strong word that means chaos. When you are operating on earthly wisdom, it produces chaos.
[time=1653] It produces instability, it destroys intimacy and unity and love, it breeds a spirit of antagonism.
[time=1662] So he is saying the product of earthly wisdom is disorder, and then he says at the end of verse 16, every evil thing, which is just a big, big word, and it can mean at its best something that is worthless, to its worst something that is vile.
[time=1680] Earthly wisdom opens the door to chaos and every conceivable evil thing. Did you see the time cover, August 15th?
[time=1689] If you did, there was a wedding ring on the cover, and it was suspended in this, I guess, a black background, and the wedding ring, there was no diamond, so I'm assuming it was the one that a husband would wear, was broken and not shattered just into two halves, and it's just kind of sitting there.
[time=1705] And underneath it, the caption reads, or the title reads, "In fidelity, it may be in our genes," and they don't mean the kind we wear, they're talking about genetics, it may be in our genes.
[time=1720] Now they're going to try to approach, they're going to try to bring their wisdom, they're going to try to bring an answer to the crisis in America, the breakdown of the American family, which starts when a husband and a wife get divorced.
[time=1734] So we're now going to get a little glimpse at earthly wisdom, and I don't do this to bash the author or those who are studying in this field, I have compassion for those people, but in looking at this, it may really throw a spotlight on the truth that James is explaining.
[time=1750] Listen to what this article says, just brief captions of it.
[time=1753] There is an emerging field known as evolutionary psychology, which can now put a finger point on the matter, the matter meaning, infidelity, fornication, adultery, the breakdown of the home.
[time=1766] By studying how the process of natural selection shaped the mind, evolutionary psychologists are painting a new portrait of human nature with fresh detail about the feelings and thoughts that draw us into marriage or push us out.
[time=1782] They're saying that by studying evolutionary psychology, we can begin to understand our feelings when we want to either get married or get out of marriage.
[time=1792] The premise of evolutionary psychology is simple, the human mind, like any other organ, was designed for the purpose of transmitting genes to the next generation.
[time=1800] That's the fundamental premise of this study of thought. The big issue is how the genes themselves want to promote themselves into the next generation. Everything flows out of that.
[time=1812] The feelings and thoughts it creates are best understood in these terms. Thus, the feeling of hunger, no less than the stomach, is here because it helped keep our ancestors alive long enough to reproduce and rear their young.
[time=1826] Feelings of lust, no less than the sex organs, are here because they aided reproduction directly.
[time=1833] Any ancestor who lacks stomachs or hunger or sex organs or lust, well, they wouldn't have become ancestors now, would they? Their traits would have been discarded by natural selection.
[time=1845] So they're saying the reason we have hunger and the reason we have stomachs, the reason we have sex drives and the reason we have sex organs is because these genes who seem to have a mind all of their own need those things so they can stay around long enough to get to the next generation.
[time=1862] The logic, that was generous, the logic goes beyond such obviously Darwinian feelings as hunger and lust.
[time=1872] According to evolutionary psychologists, our everyday ever shifting attitudes towards a mate or a prospective mate like trust, suspicion, revulsion, warmth, iciness, all those feelings,
[time=1887] these are the handiwork of natural selection that remain within us today because in the past they led to behaviors that helped spread the genes.
[time=1897] In other words, the driving issue of life is transmitting genes to the next generation.
[time=1902] Secondly, how I feel about my wife, how I feel about Heidi, whether it's trust, suspicion, revulsion, warmth or iciness, you see, those feelings are the product of my genes who are concerned that they get reproduced for the next generation.
[time=1916] Now, it gets better, just hang on.
[time=1919] They begin to address the issue inside the mail to want power and authority and money.
[time=1925] And they say this, to an evolutionary psychologist, the ultimate purpose of the wealth and power that men seek so ardently is genetic proliferation.
[time=1935] In other words, we really want success in the business place and money and power because our genes are driving us to that place because we become the stronger of the species and therefore we can have more information.
[time=1945] Therefore, we can have more babies and our genes have a better chance of surviving.
[time=1949] So they say this.
[time=1951] Thus, it is natural that a rising corporate star upon getting a big promotion should feel a strong attraction to women other than his wife.
[time=1962] You see, this is natural.
[time=1965] Testosterone, which expands a male's sexual appetite, has been shown to rise in non-human primates following social triumphs.
[time=1973] What they're talking about is a monkey in a tribe somewhere.
[time=1976] He becomes like the king Kahuna monkey in all the monkeys of the tribe.
[time=1980] That social status goes up and his testosterone level allegedly goes up and so his sexual appetite goes up.
[time=1986] So therefore, when a man gets a raise or a promotion in the corporation, he, like his primate friend, has a testosterone shift and so he's looking for gratification outside of his wife.
[time=1997] Look, that makes sense. They prove it here. Watch.
[time=2003] It says that there are hints. That's an interesting word.
[time=2006] There are hints that it does so in humans too.
[time=2010] Now, they can't prove the testosterone level goes up when you get a raise, but there are hints that that occurs.
[time=2015] Certainly, the world is full of triumphant men. Here comes the proof.
[time=2019] Donnie Carson. Donald Trump, who trade in ever-aging wives for younger, more fertile models.
[time=2028] The multi-wived Paul Getty, the multi-multibillionaire, said this, quote, "A lasting relationship with a woman is only possible if you are a business failure."
[time=2040] See? It's our genes fault.
[time=2043] The wisdom of our day to address the issue of the falling apart of the American society is we have primeval genes that want to reproduce themselves for next generation.
[time=2054] Those are what explain our irritability, our lack of love, our selfishness, our willingness not to love our wives.
[time=2062] Now, ladies, you're not off the hook. This article has you in view.
[time=2067] Here we go. A man's exalted social status can give his offspring a leg up in life, right?
[time=2074] Because he's up there. He's on the totem pole. He's more powerful, so his genes have a better chance.
[time=2080] So it's natural that women should lust after the high status men who lust after them.
[time=2088] Because you too have genes, women, and your genes are seeking to find their way into the next generation.
[time=2093] And you know that the stronger, more wealthy, more successful male has a better chance to have his offspring survive, so it's natural.
[time=2102] It's natural for you to lust after them and be unfaithful to your husband.
[time=2107] Beneath the thoughts and feelings and temperamental differences, what marriage counselors spend their time
[time=2113] sensitively assessing are the strategies of the genes. Cold, hard equations composed of simple variables like social status, age of spouse, number of children, their ages, outside romantic opportunities and so on.
[time=2127] That's really what the marriage counselors trying to do and put a marriage back together.
[time=2131] He's trying to understand the strategy of the genes inside this individual who is merely trying to make sure their genes procreate.
[time=2140] Now that's a pretty good example of the kind of wisdom that James is talking about in verses 14, 15 and 16.
[time=2148] What's the motive? Let's go back and think about it a lot. He says motive is selfish ambition and jealousy. You got it.
[time=2154] The whole system is built on survival of the fittest. My genes got to make it into the next generation.
[time=2160] And I don't care who gets extinguished for me to do that. I want to survive.
[time=2165] In reality, the genes have nothing to do with it. It is our wicked sinful heart that seeks adulterous affairs, which in itself is also selfish ambition and jealousy and a self gratifying way of life.
[time=2177] If we can just blame it on our genes, we can somehow displace personal responsibility and it becomes a natural problem instead of a sinful problem.
[time=2184] The source? Where do they get this knowledge? Well, they are evolutionary psychologists. Evolution is the study of our past by digging in the dirt.
[time=2193] The way you get any information, alleged information about evolution is by digging around in archaeological digs trying to find the very strata of life evolutionary forms.
[time=2202] It is classic James wisdom. It is earthly, it is natural, and it is demonic.
[time=2208] What does it produce? What does James say it will produce? Every evil thing and chaos. What is America all about today? Absolute chaos.
[time=2219] The home is falling apart and there are kids all over these United States of America who have never had the wonder and the privilege of growing up in a home with a mom and a dad who are secure in their love for each other.
[time=2233] They are not secure in their love and they get divorced and broken homes proliferate and the crime rate and the sexual abuse rate and all of the issues confronting our society today go up exponentially with the demise of the home.
[time=2250] You got it. Total confusion and chaos and every evil thing. Every conceivable evil thing then floods through the gates when worldly wisdom displaces godly wisdom.
[time=2267] And guess what happens? It becomes a desert. It becomes a desert and people all over our city and people all in our country are living in relational deserts.
[time=2278] That's what happens when you get divorced. That's what happens when the thing falls apart. That's what happens when your kids are scattered to the four winds.
[time=2285] That's what happens when you see them broken and struggling to eke out an existence. It's called a relational desert.
[time=2292] It's a barren place and God bless those of you who by God's grace have been able to move through a divorce and hold your family together.
[time=2302] You beat the odds and we're thankful for that. But it is nevertheless a dry, barren, rock-filled, sandy, desolate, fruitless place with no growth, no habitation, no production.
[time=2313] Those are the conditions in which many Americans find themselves today because they have followed the wisdom of this world.
[time=2323] Come with me for a moment. Keep your finger right there. But if you would, to the book of Job, I just can't pass this one up.
[time=2328] Job is right before the book of Psalms. So you'll be able to find it there. Psalms, Proverbs, right before Psalms and Proverbs is the book of Job.
[time=2336] Find chapter 28 and I've never seen it in this context before. It's just wonderful.
[time=2342] This chapter is about wisdom. It's about wisdom and understanding.
[time=2348] It just lays out on the table the very issue that our modern psychologists and anthropologists and sociologists are struggling with.
[time=2359] Job 28, verse 1, "Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where they refine gold. Iron is taken from the dust.
[time=2369] And from rock, copper is smelted. Man puts an end to darkness. And to the farthest limit, he searches out the rock in gloom and deep shadow.
[time=2377] He sinks a shaft far from habitation, forgotten by the foot. They hang and swing to and fro far from men."
[time=2385] In other words, they're talking about mining. They're talking about going below the earth's surface to extract these marvelous jewels and they'll do anything they have to do to get them.
[time=2394] Verse 5, "The earth from it comes food and underneath it is turned up as fire. Its rocks are the source of sapphires and its dust contains gold.
[time=2404] The path no bird of prey knows, nor has the falcon's eye caught sight of it. The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed over it."
[time=2413] He puts his hand on the flint. He overturns the mountains at the base. He hues out channels through the rocks and his eyes sees anything precious.
[time=2422] He dams up the streams from flowing. And what is hidden, he brings out to the light.
[time=2427] This is an incredible testimony to the industrious capacity of man to mine the earth for jewels.
[time=2433] And if there's stuff in there, they'll get it out. No matter what they have to do, they'll get it out.
[time=2438] And the lions have never gone there and bears have never gone there. In all their power and all their strength, man will go there and man will extract this jewel.
[time=2447] Now watch what he says in verse 12. But where can wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
[time=2456] Remember those two words from James 3? Wisdom and understanding. Verse 13, "Man does not know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living."
[time=2467] You can't find God's wisdom anywhere on the earth. The deep says it is not in me, and the sea says it is not with me.
[time=2476] Pure gold cannot be given in exchange for it, nor can silver be weighed as its price.
[time=2481] It cannot be valued in the gold of offer, its precious onks or sapphire. Gold or glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for articles of fine gold.
[time=2491] Coral and crystal are not to be mentioned. And the acquisition of wisdom is above that of pearls. The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.
[time=2501] Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding? Thus it is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the sky.
[time=2509] Abaddon and death say, "With our eyes we have heard a report of it." Now verse 23, "God understands its way, and He knows its place, for He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens when He imparted weight to the wind and meted out the waters by measure, when He set a limit for the rain and a course for the thunderbolt."
[time=2532] Then He saw it and declared it, He established it and searched it out. And now to us, O man He said, "Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understand."
[time=2550] Isn't that amazing? This may be the first book of the Bible ever written. Joe chronologically may have been written before Genesis.
[time=2560] And it speaks with absolute clarity. The issue of our day, we have brilliant scientists using the most modern equipment known to man searching in the dirt for wisdom.
[time=2571] From whence did we come? Why do we exist? How are we to relate with one another and where are we headed?
[time=2579] They search and they scratch and they dig with the combined brilliance of our age, and you know what? They never find it because it isn't there to be found.
[time=2590] If it were there, the implication is they'd find it because they extract everything else of value. The point is you just can't find wisdom any place else beyond the person of God and His Word.
[time=2604] And He says to you, "Your wisdom begins when you fear me, when you come to me, when you obey me, when you love me as your Savior, and your understanding comes when you depart from evil."
[time=2617] Back to James 3. What a tremendous testimony, isn't it, to the veracity of God's truth?
[time=2627] So we move now, out of the desert, to the oasis. And it's all covered in one verse, verse 17. There are seven characteristics that James uses to describe the oasis of relational blessing.
[time=2647] Look at them. I'll just run through them. But the wisdom from above is first pure. That means without pollution. That talks about a sincere moral character. That talks about somebody who does what is right.
[time=2659] Do you know what it's like to be married to somebody who has that kind of purity in their heart? There is security there. There is trust there because they have a moral framework inside of them that keeps them honest and pure to you.
[time=2675] It says next they are peaceable, which doesn't mean peace at all costs. It doesn't mean that they'll compromise the truth. It means peace around the truth.
[time=2683] And so there is a way for a marriage relationship to reconcile differences as they come together around the truth of God's Word, mutually submitting to that truth. That's an oasis.
[time=2695] Gentleness is the next word, which means to give up your personal rights. People are so secure in their fear of the Lord, their salvation that they're willing to give up their personal rights for the sake of ministering to the other person.
[time=2707] The next word is reasonable, which means not obstinate. It means teachable. It means you can get along with people inside this oasis because they are not obstinately stubborn in their point of view. And short of compromising the truth, they're more than willing to dialogue and to negotiate
[time=2723] what might be a reasonable solution to any given situation. Full of mercy is the next characteristic. And in the Greek language, it was only used of the feeling you would have for somebody who got into trouble when it wasn't their fault. They were in a bad situation, but they didn't bring it on themselves.
[time=2741] That's the only way the Greek mind understood that word mercy. But when it enters the New Testament, it takes on a completely different feel.
[time=2749] Our concept of mercy is we have feelings of mercy for people who have fallen into a bad situation even when it was their fault.
[time=2759] Do you know what kind of a relational oasis that creates when you can have mercy on the people that you love, even when the problem is their fault?
[time=2768] And there isn't a standing back and saying you created this problem, you fix it. There's a heart wrenching movement in your heart to help a brother or a sister in Christ when they're in trouble even when they brought it on themselves.
[time=2781] That's an oasis. The next word coming down this list is as beautiful as the previous. It's unwavering. That's another word for unconditional commitment.
[time=2794] That describes the relational strength that I am secure in your love and you are secure in my love no matter what you do.
[time=2802] No matter what you do, I am unwavering. I do not waver in my commitment to love you and to invest in your life.
[time=2811] And then this last one, which appropriately is last because this only can exist if the first six are in place, no hypocrisy.
[time=2820] In other words, I don't wear a happy face when I'm sad and I don't wear a sad face when I'm happy, the Greek understanding of hypocrisy.
[time=2827] I can be who I am. In our relationship, I can be who I am because I know that you are unwavering in your love and you are full of mercy.
[time=2838] You care for me even when the problem is my fault and I've caused it and because you are reasonable, you are not obstinate and you are gentle.
[time=2845] You give up your rights for me and you are a peace seeker and you have moral character.
[time=2853] I can trust you with who I really am and so I am not hypocritical with you.
[time=2860] That's the palm springs of relational environment folks and we know that here by and large.
[time=2869] We are privileged to be walking in the wisdom of God.
[time=2873] You only get that kind of experience in your life and by the way, that is what every song that has ever been written throughout the centuries is about.
[time=2880] That is the passion of the human heart to be loved and to be known and to be in relationships like verse 17.
[time=2887] In one verse, this man sums up all of what it means to be in a meaningful relationship with people.
[time=2894] When there is this one thing that makes it happen, it is the wisdom of God in your life.
[time=2902] So I don't know where you are today in your life.
[time=2915] I don't know what major issue it is you are confronted with.
[time=2920] I don't know if you are in the midst of a bruhaha there in the home.
[time=2925] I don't know if you are feeling the feelings of jealousy or selfish ambition.
[time=2931] And you might not ever admit that to anybody but when you go home at night, you know that the energy inside of you is jealousy and it is selfish ambition.
[time=2938] It is wanting to get your way.
[time=2943] But I want you to know if that is driving you, you are in the domain of earthly, natural, demonic wisdom and the choices that you will make that will come out of that motivating force will do nothing but create a wasteland in your relationships.
[time=2958] There is no good that will come from them.
[time=2960] At best, your decisions will be worthless.
[time=2962] At worst, your decisions will cause vile consequences to the people you are around.
[time=2970] It will cause chaos.
[time=2974] And so I beg you to seek the wisdom of God in your dilemma.
[time=2979] I beg you to seek the wisdom of God in your decision making process.
[time=2983] I beg you to seek the wisdom of God in your relationships.
[time=2988] And as I often say to you, sometimes you need a friend to help you discern these things because we have a way of deceiving ourselves and there is nothing like a third party perspective.
[time=2999] And it may mean that you have to take the mask off and say this is really what I am feeling, this is really what I am thinking, this is really what is motivating me.
[time=3011] What would a different motivation look like?
[time=3014] What would gentleness look like?
[time=3019] You will never regret it.
[time=3021] If you practice it, it will produce an oasis in your life.
[time=3028] And you know that is an exciting thing.
[time=3030] There are families that we can invite up onto this platform today who can say you want to know about an oasis.
[time=3034] You want to know about an oasis.
[time=3036] Let me tell you about my wife.
[time=3038] She is to me an oasis of love and support and tenderness.
[time=3043] These words describe our relationship as a pattern.
[time=3047] We could have families come up here and say you want to talk about an oasis.
[time=3050] We just had a week long vacation together and there was more purity and more reasonableness and more gentleness
[time=3057] and more unwaveringness.
[time=3061] Oh, we had such a great time.
[time=3063] Why?
[time=3064] Because you went some certain place.
[time=3065] No, because the people we were with, our family reflects the wisdom of God.
[time=3070] It is the delight of our soul.
[time=3077] It says in let me read it to you.
[time=3078] It says in Proverbs chapter 4.
[time=3081] Acquire wisdom.
[time=3088] It is obvious that James was writing to an Old Testament people.
[time=3092] Do not forget nor turn away from the words of my mouth.
[time=3096] Do not forsake her meaning wisdom and she will guard you.
[time=3100] Love her and she will watch over you.
[time=3103] The beginning of wisdom is acquire wisdom.
[time=3106] And with all your acquiring, get understanding.
[time=3109] Then he closes by saying this.
[time=3111] Prize her and she will exalt you.
[time=3114] She will honor you if you embrace her.
[time=3116] She will place on your head a garland of grace.
[time=3120] A garland of grace on your head if you will just guard and honor and protect wisdom in your life.
[time=3126] And then it says this.
[time=3128] And wisdom will present you with a crown of beauty.
[time=3132] Man, I'm so thankful for this book because it is the divine interjection of wisdom into
[time=3143] a finite and closed system.
[time=3148] Here are our answers.
[time=3149] Here is the pursuit of our life to walk in wisdom.
[time=3153] Francis of Assisi prayed this very famous prayer.
[time=3157] Lord, make me an instrument of your peace.
[time=3161] Where there is hatred, let me so love.
[time=3164] Where there is injury, pardon.
[time=3165] Where there is doubt, faith.
[time=3167] Where there is despair, hope.
[time=3168] Where there is darkness, light.
[time=3170] Where there is sadness, joy.
[time=3172] O divine master grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console.
[time=3179] To be understood as to understand.
[time=3181] To be loved as to love.
[time=3184] For it is in giving that we receive.
[time=3187] It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.
[time=3189] It is in dying, dying to self that we are born to eternal life.
[time=3196] There is wisdom in a prayer.
[time=3201] Father, we're thankful.
[time=3203] Man, we read the book of Job and we see the industry of human beings to extract gold and silver.
[time=3211] Things of incredible earthly value.
[time=3216] And we recognize that what you dropped in our laps this morning in the Word of God is a far greater value.
[time=3224] And we could never have come upon these truths were we to search within our own universe.
[time=3230] We only have them because of revelation.
[time=3232] You reveal them to us in your scriptures.
[time=3237] And we hold on to them and we cling to them tightly in our hearts and we try to live them out.
[time=3242] Give us grace, God, to be wiser.
[time=3245] Give us grace to know how to live your truth more practically in our lives so that the relational oasis of verse 17 can blossom in our life.
[time=3254] In great and new ways help us to become wonderful gardeners as it were, the wisdom of God.
[time=3262] Lord, our hearts go out to those who are brilliant intellectuals scratching in the dirt for answers to life.
[time=3272] In our prayer for them, God is that you would save them profoundly and wonderfully as they see the futility of their own search and study.
[time=3279] And as they see the desert that exists in their own relational world, that they are not loving, compassionate, sensitive, self-sacrificing, spirit-empowered people,
[time=3290] that they are full of selfish ambition and bitter jealousy.
[time=3295] And God for those in our own city and our neighborhoods who are being led along by this false wisdom,
[time=3304] our prayer God is that you would allow the attractiveness of our relationships to draw them to want to experiment and taste and see the wisdom of God.
[time=3314] We love you and praise you for these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3320] [MUSIC]
[time=3330] Well, as we conclude our time together, I want to take a moment and ask you how you're doing in your life right now.
[time=3336] And are we describing you?
[time=3339] Does the Word of God really describe the condition of your relationships?
[time=3342] And does it look a little bit like a desert?
[time=3344] It's dry and it's parched and it's barren and it's fruitless and you're hurting over that and you're wishing that it could be different?
[time=3351] And you here describe the oasis of Christian love and you're saying, "How do I get into that?"
[time=3357] The answer is it begins with a relationship, a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3363] By asking Him to be your Savior, He can make your relationship right with God.
[time=3368] And then the other relationships in your life can begin to reflect that love that God will give you through Jesus Christ.
[time=3376] Apart from the Lord, there really is no way to have this oasis of strong Christian relationships.
[time=3382] And so maybe the Spirit of God has prepared your heart even this morning through the events in the last week or the last month to say,
[time=3390] "You know what? I really do need Christ. I want to be made right with God." If you're in that position today and you'd like to pray to receive Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, I'd invite you to bow your head right now where you are and follow along as I pray this prayer to help you invite Jesus Christ to be your Savior.
[time=3407] Let's pray together.
[time=3410] Lord, I know that I am a sinful person.
[time=3414] I know that because I can look at the relationships in my life and I can see the selfish ambition and the jealousy that fills my heart
[time=3421] and the destructive result that has brought in my life.
[time=3424] I'm thankful to know I can be forgiven through Jesus Christ from my sins to be made right with God.
[time=3429] And so I invite Jesus into my heart right now to be my Savior and to be my Lord.
[time=3435] I commit my life to Him to following His Word, to living the way He wants me to live.
[time=3441] That He would be glorified through my life.
[time=3445] That I can be forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and receive the gift of eternal life.
[time=3451] Thank you Lord for saving me. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3456] If you've made that decision just now, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=3459] So write us and let us know the nature of your decision.
