[time=0] I believe that each and every one of us this morning has an area or areas where we can
[time=7] honestly say I am profoundly disappointed.
[time=11] This really isn't the way I wanted it to go.
[time=26] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we hope
[time=32] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=34] Thank you for joining us.
[time=36] Every person who's ever lived has had to learn to deal with disappointment.
[time=41] There's never been a person who hasn't had to face the fact that a situation, a job, aspects of their childhood, sometimes their entire life, has turned out far worse than they'd hoped.
[time=52] To be alive is to have to deal with disappointment.
[time=56] How do you deal with disappointment?
[time=58] Have you ever stopped to isolate that area of your life?
[time=62] It might interest you to know that there is a right way and there's a wrong way to handle disappointment.
[time=68] The right way honors God promotes healthy relationships and builds character in your life.
[time=74] The wrong response dishonors God, destroys your relationships, and diminishes your character.
[time=81] Today with us today is Pastor Moore, continues his series in the book of James.
[time=85] The passage we'll be studying today explains the wrong way to deal with disappointment and offers some very helpful direction in how to respond the right way.
[time=95] Our special music today will be provided by the Men Singers and Lori Scheiman.
[time=103] Let's join our service.
[time=117] I'm out for let's see, God's holy wife City, yes I am, I'll never turn back to this world
[time=131] anymore.
[time=132] Don't matter how rough they be the way, no matter how off I stop them pray.
[time=138] I'm out for let's see, all that evergreen show.
[time=144] There's a city of light, where there comeeth no night, and the sun never sets in the sky.
[time=159] In the Bible we're told that the streets are pure gold, and a cool gentle river runs by.
[time=173] I'm out for let's see, God's holy wife City, yes I am, I'll never turn back to this world
[time=185] anymore.
[time=186] Don't matter how rough they be the way, no matter how off I stop them pray.
[time=194] I'm out for let's see, all that evergreen show.
[time=200] The little children will play, and their hearts will be gay, as they stroll through the city
[time=213] of gold.
[time=216] No more crying up there, no more burdens to bear, and nobody will be fever or old.
[time=229] I'm out for let's see, God's holy wife City, yes I am, I'll never turn back to this world
[time=244] anymore.

[time=297] anymore.
[time=300] No matter how rough they be the way, no matter how off I stop them pray.
[time=308] I am proud for let's see, all that evergreen show, all that evergreen show.
[time=330] We'll return to the service in just a moment.
[time=342] You know, each week as you watch the Bible Hour you've probably noticed the beautiful open Bible stained glass window on the front of our church.
[time=349] It's a symbol of our constant desire to learn more from God's Word and apply it to our daily lives.
[time=354] And now the Bible Hour is pleased to offer you this miniature replica of the Bible window on this attractive gold pin.
[time=361] It's our hope that it will serve as a reminder to you to pray for the Bible Hour.
[time=365] We're sending this pin to all our viewers who write and enclose a suggested gift of ten dollars.
[time=370] Write us today, won't you?
[time=372] Now let's return to our service.
[time=374] Well, doesn't he have a wonderful voice that of course was the voice of Jeff Carlson and we're so thankful for his life and ministry.
[time=382] He and his new bride Becky and their daughter Darcy are a part of our church and we're just excited about the way that God is using them as well as the ministry that Jeff has at WBCL.
[time=392] We would love to send along one of those pins to you as a reminder to pray for our ministry.
[time=397] We're so thankful for what God is doing in the Bible Hour.
[time=401] Well, today we're on a wonderful topic of dealing with discouragement and finding our only hope in the person of Jesus Christ and finding in him the strength to submit to God's
[time=412] will for our life, even in the middle of great disappointment, knowing that he will cause it all for his glory and that he'll grow us up into a deeper and more profound love for the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=424] And today the music that we'll be just here in a moment is by a gal named Laurie Scheiman, a part of our church through the years, a wonderful godly gal that's in college now.
[time=433] And as you might remember, the college years can be somewhat turbulent.
[time=437] She's had a very difficult trying summer.
[time=440] God has done some things in her summer that she wouldn't have chosen for herself.
[time=444] And at the beginning of the summer, set the song that she's about to sing to memory and to her own heart.
[time=449] I'm sure you'll be touched as she sings out of the depth of her own love and conviction for our loving Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=470] When the going gets tough when the right's too rough,
[time=488] when you're just not sure enough, Jesus will still be there.
[time=498] His love will never change, sure as the steady rain, Jesus will still be there.
[time=511] When no one else is true, he'll still be loving you.
[time=520] And it looks like you've lost it all, and you haven't got a prayer, Jesus will still
[time=533] be there.
[time=547] When the wind flies, hearts turn, a little bit wiser from lessons learned.
[time=559] Sometimes weakness wins, and you'll lose your foot hold once again.
[time=570] When the going gets tough when the right's too rough,
[time=577] when you're just not sure enough, Jesus will still be there.
[time=587] His love will never change, sure as the steady rain,
[time=595] Jesus will still be there, when no one else is true, he'll still be loving you.
[time=609] When it looks like you've lost it all, and you haven't got a prayer, Jesus will still
[time=620] be there.
[time=627] Jesus will still be there, his love will never change, sure as the steady rain,
[time=640] Jesus will still be there, when no one else is true, he'll still be there.
[time=650] He'll still be loving you, when it looks like you've lost it all,
[time=659] and you haven't got a prayer, Jesus will still be there.
[time=670] When it looks like you've lost it all, and you haven't got a prayer,
[time=678] Jesus will still be there.
[time=707] That's a great song.
[time=710] Laurie and I prayed together between the services, just because in the first service, her voice broke more dramatically than it did here, not because of her voice, just because of the emotion that she has in her heart.
[time=721] For the truth of that song and the way that God has worked that into her life through the last several months through this summer, she's encountered some tremendous disappointment at the early part of the summer, and that song became her theme throughout the entire summer, been singing it and listening to it all the time, and when she gets to that part in the song where she really sings, "Jesus will still be there," it just breaks her up in her heart, isn't that exciting?
[time=744] It's not only true, it's true in her life, and it means so much to her.
[time=749] And really, we couldn't have had a better song, it wasn't planned, but to be honest, we couldn't have had a better song to introduce our message this morning.
[time=755] I'd like you to come with me, if you will, to James chapter 4, and it's all about how
[time=765] to respond to disappointment, and maybe the best way to get you into this passage
[time=772] and to try to engage your thoughts this morning and the truth of God's Word as they're presented in James 4, is I want to ask you a question, and I want you to try to answer it in the honesty of your heart and in the integrity of your heart, please don't just go over the top of this question and get by this part of the sermon, please really tune in with me here for a minute. I just need to ask you this question, I'll try to give you some categories underneath it to help you answer it. The question is this, what do you do when you don't get what you want?
[time=802] What do you do when you don't get what you want? And I don't mean to put an overly selfish spin on that question, I know it could have that connotation, I just mean generally, and honestly, and fairly, how do you react, how do you
[time=816] respond in life when things don't go your way, things you were really hoping for, do not work out as you had intended them to, or I hope they would have. Go back in
[time=828] your mind, go back in your life, find the answer to that question, is there a way that you typically respond when you do not get what you want? What happens, how do you respond when you think your kids are not turning out the way that you want them to? Or maybe they're grown now and you're certain that they haven't turned out the way that you want them to. How do you respond to a situation when your husband doesn't treat you the way you want him to? Not just once, not just twice, but it's the habitual pattern of his life, he's just, he's just missing this whole dimension and it's just never you think going to connect and it hasn't connected. How do you respond to that? What you really want is to be loved and cherished, but it doesn't happen. How do you respond to health problems where you're finding that it may not ever change for the better? It's certainly not what you want and the prognosis isn't good and your very physical strength and mobility and the things you'd hope for at this time in your life are being taken away from you because of bad health. How do you respond to a job situation where
[time=889] it is not working out the way you want it to work? Either the job isn't making you enough money or the job isn't challenging or hopes for advancement are not forthcoming or you've lost your job entirely and your entire financial situation is on the line. How do you respond to that when it doesn't go the way you want? What do you do when aspects of your childhood clearly are different than what you would have wanted them to be and you carry emotional scars and baggage from your past that you think ought to go away but don't and they haunt you and they are with you and you must deal with them on a daily basis and it's not what you want. How do you respond to that? How about the sum total
[time=932] of your life? For some of you this you look at your life and you go this isn't what I wanted. There's very little at all in this scenario that would approximate what I would have wanted for my life. You've heard of the three R's
[time=947] of education, reading, writing and arithmetic and those were presented some years ago as the foundational fundamental truths and if you could just master those three things then you would have built a foundation upon which all other learning could occur. Well this morning just to give you a memory queue
[time=966] for this or a key to try to help it be something you can walk out the door with.
[time=970] I want to give you the three D's not the three R's of education but the three D's of disappointment. You can take these to the bank. These are principles that you can live by. These are principles that I hope if you can understand them if I can get them across if you'll engage with me this morning at a real level you can take them with you through your life and you can build upon them in the upcoming events of your life. They are these. One, desiring to denying and
[time=998] three demanding. The three D's of disappointment, desiring, denying and
[time=1004] demanding. Now nobody who has ever lived has been able to avoid disappointment not even our Lord Jesus Christ. Everybody who has ever walked the face of this earth has had to face up to disappointment. The question isn't can we escape being disappointed. The question is how are we going to respond to disappointment and most people will respond most often in one of these three D's. There'll be a desiring, a denying or a demanding and James 4 is all about the last one demanding but before we can get to that and before I have confidence that I think we'll understand what he's actually saying in this text. We need first to look at the first two desiring and denying and again I ask you to hold in the front of your mind as I am talking through these issues your response to disappointment and compare it to the truth that we will be looking at here in God's Word. There will become your greatest benefit. The first D then in the face of disappointment desiring that things could be different. Desiring that things could be different. This is by the way the only
[time=1070] right and godly way to handle disappointment in your life. The other two are wrong and sinful. This is the only way that a person can respond to the hardship and the trial and the the disappointments of life in a way that honor God. And to take a look at this we need to go to a completely different passage. So come with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 12 for a moment and we'll spend
[time=1091] some time here trying to learn how are you supposed to respond to the
[time=1097] disappointments of life. And my answer to that is to use one of these D words to
[time=1103] desire that things could be different and I hope you'll understand that as we go. The situation is very clear. Paul is writing about his own disappointment.
[time=1111] Paul has a very difficult situation in his life. Paul has in background has
[time=1117] received an enormous amount of revelation from God himself out of which he has written most of the New Testament. That's kind of a heady thing and that can cause a person to get proud and that can cause a person to be independent and to think more of themselves than they have to think. And so God has brought a difficult disappointing hardship into the life of Paul to keep that from occurring. You can pick it up in verse 7. Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations for this reason to keep me from exalting myself there was given
[time=1147] me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me to keep me from exalting myself. Concerning this I untreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me and he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for a power is perfected in weakness. Now we don't really know what the thorn in the flesh is and we don't really know what it means a messenger of Satan to buffet me. We're not clear on all those details. Some would suggest that Paul is describing here a terrible eye disease that was common in that day that he may have had been inflicted with or come across and contract that would have rendered him almost blind nearly blind and there would have been an oozing stuff that came out of his eyes almost on a constant basis and there would have been no medication and no resolve for that. Others suggest that it may have been a person that the most painful thing that God ever brings into our life are people that we have loved people that we have cherished people that we have led into the intimate parts of our life maybe in Paul's life he has even discipled men maybe this is Philippians one and those who were aspiring to his position of leadership now that he was out of commission there in Philippians one. We don't know that it might not have been a person who was now turning and betraying him and using the intimacy of that relationship to drive a knife into his heart. We really cannot specify nowhere does the Bible tell us exactly what it is that is so disappointing to him and so grievous to his heart and so difficult to live with but we know it's there and we also know that he has entreated God three times that it might depart from him. Now keep in mind this is the Apostle Paul this is the powerful one this is the miracle worker this is the one who for example in Acts chapter 20 was able to rid people of disease and sickness and ailments without even being in their presence when Paul asked God to do something to relieve a pressure in someone's life it happened he is not
[time=1264] on the custom to seeing the miraculous power of God removed difficult painful disappointing circumstances from people's lives but when he entreats God for his own ailment for his own trouble for his own sorrow for his own disappointment three times God says no and so he comes to the realization that his disappointment is long-term he may die with this this may characterize the rest of his life but look at what he does and this is what I mean by desiring things
[time=1293] could be different he says in verse 9 my grace is sufficient for for you for power is perfected in weakness most gladly therefore I will rather boast about my weaknesses that the power of Christ may dwell in me therefore I am well content with weakness with insults with distress with persecutions with difficulties for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong he broadens the context of of disappointment beyond his own thorn in the flesh to insults distress persecution and difficulty so we all know we're in there with him and what he is saying is this rather than then succumb to temptation which might
[time=1333] provide some temporary alleviation of this thorn in my flesh at a possible
[time=1339] distraction I draw near to God I say to God I will gladly and willingly submit
[time=1346] and accept this horrendous reality in my life because I know that it humbles me before you it weakens me before you it forces me out of trying to live my life under my own power and my own control trying to get my life to work the way I want my life to work this this trial in my life this messenger of Satan throws
[time=1367] me on the mat whereby I cry uncle I cannot do it and in that point of extreme weakness I acknowledge your power and I draw upon it to live a completely different kind of life it's an amazing response to severe
[time=1384] disappointment so let me go back and say it to you this way he responds to his disappointment number one notice this he is very much aware of his disappointment he is not in denial which we'll talk about in a minute he does not mitigate it he does not say oh it doesn't matter it's okay I'm so full of the joy of the Lord that I don't even know that I have an ailment here he instead is very very aware of it and he embraces the disappointment and the pain that it represents in his life so much so that he prays three times to
[time=1418] God and apparently circumstantially I mean he prays for God to change his circumstances whether it was a physical ailment or a person or some of the thing we don't know about he's saying God get that thing or get that person out of my life but and rightly he submits when he realizes that it's not
[time=1438] going to change and he humbles himself in the process he honors God we know from
[time=1445] the rest of Paul's life that he did not fall into a self-absorption over his own disappointment he did not allow this disappointment to become the all consuming thing in his life which rendered him helpless and useless for the cause of Christ instead humbling himself under it rejoicing in it in the fact that it draws him closer to Christ and drawing on the power of Christ he continues to live for other people he continues to use what he is and his resources and his personality and his gifts to give his life away to enhance the cause of Christ in other people's lives and you might notice that in the
[time=1481] process of coming under this disappointment in a right way he becomes a more powerful person this does not weaken him this does not destroy him this does
[time=1491] not provide excuses for him not to live faithfully instead it adds a whole new dimension to his life called empathy and because he has hurt and because he has hurt deeply and because he has hurt long-term in a deep way he can now relate with people he could never relate with with before other people who are experiencing enormous levels of disappointment which by the way is most of humanity if God were in fact to have removed this from his life he would be one of the very few people who had walked the planet who had not had to deal with long-term deep profound disappointment that refused to go away and so how could he be effective in people's lives how could there be any pathos how could there be any connecting of soul to soul in the in the real moments of life he wouldn't have it he would have been a much impoverished servant were he not under this situation and notice also that his relationship with God is powerfully strengthened powerfully strengthened he knows now a level of dependence upon God that without this this thorn in the flesh this messenger of Satan he would never have had to lean as heavily and as powerfully on God's power as he is right now in the midst of this so the relationship with God is built up it's an amazing response to disappointment it is the godly response
[time=1566] to disappointment it is the only godly response to disappointment now let's learn more about it by contrasting the two ungodly responses this next one is what I call denying the situation is disappointment is disappointing this response to disappointment which many of us struggle with is we are so afraid of the pain we are so afraid of of of having to face the reality that life
[time=1591] isn't what we want it to be that we pretend that it's other than it is we
[time=1598] we say to ourselves oh it doesn't hurt that bad or things much worse than this have happened to other people who am I to worry about my hardship we say things
[time=1608] that push the reality of that disappointment out of our life now denial is
[time=1615] a word that's used a lot in secular circles so let me tell you what I think I mean by it denial is when you refuse to acknowledge how you really feel about
[time=1625] a situation event or a relationship denial is when you refuse to acknowledge
[time=1631] to yourself much less to somebody else but mainly to yourself you numb yourself you defend yourself you put barriers up against feeling how bad it really hurts
[time=1643] any situation any disappointing event any disappointing relationship and Christians are especially prone to doing this because we feel and misunderstand these exhortations to rejoice in the Lord always and if to feel the pain of our life somehow that seems disobedient to rejoicing always and yet we look clearly into the face of our Lord and see the tears running down his face as he honestly embraced the disappointing realities in his life but somehow the
[time=1671] human thinks that we can take the pain and the disappointment and stuff it somewhere inside of us and if we just stuff it far enough and deep enough it will leave us alone and that couldn't be further from the truth it's a little bit like a leaky faucet actually the pipe underneath the leaky faucet and your wife draws it to your attention and you look at it and say sure enough you know it's leaking not too fast but it's leaking and you don't want to deal with it you
[time=1698] don't want to take the time you're not a good plumber and you don't want to pay a plumber and so though it's dripping and though it's leaking you shut the cupboard door and you go do something else you go back to what you were doing and then you get really distracted and other things that you weren't even doing then and pretty soon you've forgotten that you have a leaky faucet and you don't think it's a problem anymore but all the while it's been leaking there's a
[time=1722] drop hitting the ground about every half a second and eventually what happens the
[time=1729] whole floorboard is eroded if you let it go long enough it eats down through the foundation of your house you have a leaking thing coming through your basement now you can't leave it alone it won't go away you can't pretend that the
[time=1743] pain in your life doesn't exist and you also can't pretend that by refusing to deal with the pain in your life that somehow you've dealt with it properly and it goes away all you've done is postpone the problem and let it give evidence in far more damaging ways at later times let me introduce you to a
[time=1763] woman who was living in denial come with me to John chapter 4 John chapter 4
[time=1771] you see the fact is God built us for heaven God built us for the Garden of
[time=1778] Eden God built us with a capacity to enjoy and to be satisfied to the basic
[time=1784] moral of our existence with his presence and the world in which we live does not
[time=1790] have the capacity to satisfy the soul only God does only the response that Paul
[time=1797] had I would much rather and be content in my weakness knowing that the power of God lives in me finding his satisfaction in God but few of us can come to grips
[time=1808] with this as profoundly as we are and particularly this woman here in John 4 who is an unconverted Samaritan half Jew half Gentile you can pick up the narrative in John 4 verse 7 there came a woman of Samaria to draw water and Jesus said to her give me a drink he was physically thirsty we know through his
[time=1829] miraculous power he could have solved that it wasn't really a problem that he needed to drink it was an opportunity to impact this life and to help her understand the level at which she was denying that the circumstances and the condition of her own soul verse 8 his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food the Samaritan woman therefore said to him how is it you being a Jew ask me for a drink since I am a Samaritan woman for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans and if you don't know this Samaritans are half Jew half Greek and there was a big dispersed you know big dispute going on between Jews and the Samaritans because the Samaritans were just half breeds and no true Jew would actually talk to a half breed Samaritan bunch of racial stuff verse 10 Jesus
[time=1874] answered and said to her if you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water and she said to him sir you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep
[time=1888] where then do you get the living water see she's still thinking on physical terms she's thinking about real water verse 12 you are not greater than our father Jacob are you who gave us the well and drank of it himself and his sons and his cattle and Jesus answered and said to her everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life now she didn't understand most of that but what she did understand was that my goodness this guy is claiming a kind of water she's thinking physical water that if I could just get I would never have to have another drink again and most importantly look at verse 15 I wouldn't have to come back to this stupid well time and time again every day then the woman said this verse 15 sir give me this water so I will not be thirsty
[time=1937] nor come all the way here to draw see she actually thinks he's got a type of literal water that would keep her from making this trek two to three to four times a day putting the pot down putting the pot on her head and walking back now
[time=1954] it's time for him to move from what she knows about to what she doesn't know about it's time for him to invade the space of her denial it's time for her for
[time=1963] him to try to bring her in the touch with reality about her own soul and her own life and so you see what is apparently a totally off-the-wall comment in verse 16 comes out of nowhere if you don't know what he's doing he said to her go call your husband and come here now what in the world does that have to do with getting a drink and a water that never makes you thirsty again nothing but what he's doing is he's transitioning from physical water to spiritual water and he's trying to reveal to this woman that she has a thirst in her soul that she has been trying to satisfy through illegitimate ways and like natural water it can never really satisfy her heart the woman answered in
[time=2005] verse 17 and said I have no husband and Jesus said to her you have well said I have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one whom you now have is not your husband this you have truly said you see what he's doing he's saying
[time=2021] lady listen I made you I know the properties of your soul I know that without
[time=2029] a vital living active vibrant relationship with God your soul thirsts your soul is
[time=2036] not satisfied your soul can never be quenched I know that I made you that way you don't know that yet you haven't acknowledged that yet you are still living in denial you still think that you can satisfy your soul in the other things so let me introduce you to the subject this way look at how you have to do this every day it's more water and more water and more water and more water see the repetitious cycle see how you can never get enough see how it never really satisfies she gets that concept she lived that concept she hates drawing water from the well and she's ready not to have to do it anymore he's got her thinking in the right direction now he has to make a switch from what she knows about the physical properties of water and their limitations to the spiritual condition of her soul so he points to the one place in her life which most obviously evidences her attempt to satisfy the thirst of her soul through the natural world she meets the first guy she says now this guy I like this guy
[time=2094] I'm gonna marry this guy this guy can satisfy my soul this guy can fill me up
[time=2100] this guy can make me feel really good this guy can resolve the the pinging
[time=2106] thirst to experience a good life she marries him and finds out who knows how long probably not very long because she's had a lot of these that he can't do that so she divorces him she meets another guy oh he can do this he can
[time=2122] satisfy my soul so she marries him finds out shortly now he can't do that either husband three husband four husband five now she finally says I'm not in any more husbands that's just too much hassle how about we just live together and we'll find out if you can satisfy my soul and obviously he won't either now it doesn't
[time=2142] have to be this woman and this particular well and this particular area of trying to satisfy thirst you look around you look in your own life you look at the people around you people are frantically trying to feel a sense of satisfaction through any number of various ways through relationships through professional
[time=2162] accomplishments through possessions through money through a bank account through certain levels of security through certain levels of position and prestige through certain levels of competence at any particular thing we're all running after a sense of gratification and satisfaction in places other than finding
[time=2181] that totally and completely in the person of God and so he works and labors with her to point that out she gets the point she says in verse 19 the woman said
[time=2193] to him sir I perceive that you are a prophet verse 20 our father's worship in this mountain and you people say that in Jerusalem is the place where men are to worship Jesus said to her women believe me an hour is coming where neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the father you worship that what you do not know we worship that which we know for salvation is from the Jews now this is a little thing going on between where is the right place to worship is it in Mount Gerasim where the Samaritans did it or is it in Jerusalem where the Jews did it and then he gets to the point in verse 23 it doesn't matter where you worship it's how you worship verse 23 but an hour is
[time=2231] coming and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth for such people the Father seeks to be his worshipers spirit and in truth he's saying it doesn't matter if you worship at Gerasim and it doesn't matter if you worship at Jerusalem what matters is the way you worship me and the way you must worship me the way you must relate to me at our highest level of communion is in spirit and in truth truth is another word for
[time=2256] reality it's the opposite of denial it's all a Thea in the Greek and it means
[time=2262] this that you are worshiping me out of the reality of your life and that's what he's doing he's saying woman come to me and worship me it doesn't matter Gerasim or Jerusalem come to me and acknowledge that you cannot find satisfaction anywhere else not in husband one through five nor the man you're living with acknowledge that come to me in spirit and in reality of your life and say it's only you God who can satisfy the pangs and the longings and the thirst of my soul any other kind of relationship with me any other kind of worship is masked by your own pretending that you can find life somewhere else
[time=2299] which speaks well which speaks well for what we saw in 2 Corinthians 12 it
[time=2305] speaks well for embracing the reality of your life the disappointments of your life the hardships of your life the parts of your life that didn't go the way you wanted them to go because it's that stuff that you bring to the worship service and offer it to God and say God out of the reality of this condition of my soul not with a Christian smiley face here not with what not with some belligerent commitment to always feel a kind of happiness that the Bible never even calls for but in the reality of the hardship and the disappointment and the pain of my own situation I bring it to you and I say I am not enough and I am nothing without you God somehow teach me that you are enough in reality so God
[time=2350] calls us to embrace the pain of disappointment in our lives and to allow it to drive us to a place a weakened place where we seek him and him alone and where
[time=2360] we find that we'll make it through another day only through his power now
[time=2366] few of us live there many of you probably this goes boom over your head
[time=2373] and it's just words because God has never put you through something that is difficult enough yet that you drop others of you have dropped and you know exactly what I'm talking about it's a part of the growth process let's go now
[time=2391] to the third D and let's look at James for many of us will only be able to get
[time=2397] to the right place by recognizing that we respond improperly to disappointment
[time=2404] and that's what this passage does it just absolutely takes a knife and opens up the anatomy of a wrong response to disappointment and it is demanding that
[time=2416] the situation would change not desiring the situation would be different not denying a situation is bad but demanding that the situation change and we won't get through the whole passage but for the sake of your outline this passage will reveal to us three things number one it will help us understand what is a demanding spirit what actually is a demanding spirit number two what
[time=2439] are the consequences of a demanding spirit and number three what is the cure for a demanding spirit let's begin by understanding what in the world is a demanding spirit read verses one and two with me of James for what is the source
[time=2453] of quarrels and conflicts among you is not the source your pleasures that wage
[time=2459] war in your members you lust and do not have so you commit murder and you are envious and count obtains so you fight and quarrel you do not have because you do not ask now at first glance you would think wait a minute this passage isn't about demanding this this passage is about conflicts and wars and murdering no it's about the inner attitude that produces conflicts and murder and fights and quarrels the three very very powerful words in these two verses and if you're
[time=2489] carrying an NIV with you this morning they do not come across as well as they might in your particular translation let me help you with all three of them the first is in verse one where it says what is the source of your quarrels and conflicts among you is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your member pleasures I think your text might read desires in the Greek it's called hedonum it's from the Greek word from which we get our word hedonite and a
[time=2515] hedonistic person is one who lives for pleasure it describes the strong desire to please yourself a hedonistic person is someone who has said the ultimate
[time=2526] priority in my life is pleasing myself and before we distance ourselves too
[time=2532] quickly from this as a priority in our lives you need to understand that it doesn't just mean a hedonistic pursuit of alcohol and sex and money and the
[time=2542] grossly immoral things that the Bible categorically you know says against you
[time=2548] can be a hedonist and a Christian you can be a Christian hedonist you can set
[time=2554] something which you think and in fact is very reasonable in your life that my kids turn out the way I want them to now there that is something that is
[time=2564] something that you can pursue and the pleasure of it above God you can be
[time=2570] raising your kids in such a way and striving to do the Christian thing and what is really driving you in your heart is you want your kids to turn out a certain way because you know you're happiest when they do and the whole endeavor is rather selfish because what you're hoping is for your kids to turn out right because when your kids turn out right that's what makes you happy your identity is caught up in that not God not honoring God hedonism doesn't
[time=2598] have to mean this the pursuit of wanting sexual pleasure and orgies and alcohol hedonism can be when you are pursuing good things but you are choosing to pursue good things above God himself and what you're really longing for out of your life is to get the things the good things that you want and you're hoping he will be a helpful servant to create such a reality God becomes your genie God becomes your servant boy God becomes the one you pray to to get your life to look the way you want it to look that's hedonism it gets worse beginning of
[time=2632] verse 2 you see where it says you want I think in the NIV or rather you lust and do not have lust is a wonderful translation it's the word epithemia and it's the strongest word for desire in all the New Testament it is an impassioned inordinate desire it is when your desires run away with yourself they they just get an energy all their own and it becomes the all-consuming passion to have something or to have someone or to have some situation turn out the way you want it to turn out the next word also in verse 2 you lust and do not have so you commit murder and you are envious I think the NIV says want again you are envious and cannot obtain that word describes a hot desire to possess
[time=2672] something and what I am suggesting to you is that you as a Christian with worthy
[time=2679] goals like having your kids turn out right like having your husband treat you the way he want you want him to treat you in reasonable ways like the Bible describes he should treat you like being able to work in the marketplace and earn a living and pay your bills and provide for your family like the Bible says you ought to like being able to use your spiritual gifts which God has given you and he wants you to employ them in the church to set that as your goal to have decent health so that you can go about the things of your life and serve him as you want to all of those are very legitimate goals aren't they when you put those in the place of God you and I are hedonists and there comes the source
[time=2717] of our conflict there comes the source of our fighting and there comes the source of our quarrels anytime at any point your wants for those kinds of things good or
[time=2730] bad wants legitimate or illegitimate wants escalate above your want of God himself you are out of bounds you say how I know if that's true of me I mean it
[time=2740] is true that we're supposed to desire things that are good isn't it yes desire implies a submissive heart if the Lord should will it to occur desire implies
[time=2751] hard work to move in the right direction but it stops short of placing that desire at a place above God you say how do I know if I've pushed some of these
[time=2761] good things above my relationship with God number one you will find there is a restlessness in your soul look at verse one of chapter four the second part of the verse is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members you look inside your life and what you have going on is a war there is nothing
[time=2781] what Paul knew of in 2 Corinthians 9 and Philippians 4 of true contentment you know we're near contentment you are so frustrated and so unable to capture the kind of result that you want with your kids or your job or your ministry or anything else in your life that there is this unsettled discontented war going on inside you if that's you it's a good indicator that you have got something in
[time=2807] your life that's higher than God on the priority list the second one is even more telling and that would be conflict with others look at it in verse two you lust
[time=2817] and you do not have so you murder now murder is an extreme case but we know
[time=2824] from the sermon on the mount the Lord says if you have anger in your heart towards another person you may as well have murdered them because it's a murderous intention and it includes anything along that spectrum angry thoughts
[time=2835] angry intentions wishing evil on someone else taking the light and someone else's demise anything inside of you that is malice towards another person indicates that somewhere you've got your pleasures above God you can count on that that will always be true and you are envious and cannot obtain so
[time=2855] you fight and quarrel that inner attitude will work its way out into your life
[time=2861] and you'll find yourself in fights and in quarrels why because these people are
[time=2867] standing in the way of what you want your husband is standing in the way of what you want you want him to treat you a certain way your children are standing in the way of what you want you want them to come out a certain way your employer is standing in the way of what you want you want your job to work a certain way and you will be angry in your heart because you are not getting what you want and it will eventually impact and negatively evidence itself in fighting and quarreling there is a subtle shift of the soul that happens where
[time=2903] instead of longing to serve and to obey God you are trying to accomplish your
[time=2909] own goals even though some of them may be good and that is where the violations come let me I could give you hundreds of examples of this out of my life I mean I could we could stay here till tomorrow and I wouldn't have even given you some of the glaring ones let me give you just one that happens repeatedly it happens
[time=2927] at bedtime in the more household and you wake up in the morning and you say
[time=2934] something in your heart at least I do along these lines God you know somehow allow me to use the next you know 24 hours to invest in the kingdom I want to
[time=2946] make investments in what you're you're caring about give me the strength and the power to use what I am and who I am to positively impact the people in my world for the cause of Christ that's a pretty basic prayer for me in the morning and I mean it and I try to get up and I try to go after it sometimes on really really really good days I feel like I'm doing some of that sometimes those days
[time=2968] can be hard and long and disappointments can occur and I can feel drained and tapped through all of that but hopefully there's been a steadiness and a perseverance in the soul to continue to look at the other person's needs and to minister to that other person's needs get home and there's more of the same and
[time=2986] there are needs that need to be met at the house and kids that need attention and a wife that that needs to be loved and which is the love of my life and so there's more investment there and finally you're just feeling like somebody hooked up an extension cord into you and drained the last little ounce of strength in your body out and what you really needed some time for yourself is there anything wrong with time for yourself no we see the Lord finding time for himself praying all night at a mountain we see him removing himself from the crowds this is not a statement against time for yourself this is a statement against demanding that you get that time for yourself there's the line of demarcation and so the kids are supposed to be in bed hypothetically let's say it's everybody in bed at nine and they're on their way and then they're not on their way and they're in and then they're out and then they forgot this and then they forgot that and then there's this and then there's that and then there's the other thing and then there's one other one we have five of them we have a lot of options for all this stuff you understand I'm saying there's this and there's that and pretty soon it's 9 45 and my time to watch something on
[time=3049] the television to read something to sit quietly with my wife to do whatever I wanted to do is gone now if I am in this mode right here man they get singed they
[time=3065] get singed I may even have nice words but man they can look right through that into my attitude and they get singed because I am demanding my time and
[time=3075] suddenly there's a shift in my soul from being a servant to give my life and to be expended even when I don't think I have anything else to give to some how now I need this time so I can recoup and they go away thinking what was his
[time=3090] problem tonight you know and there's violation that's that's called relational
[time=3099] violation so I can give you examples of that at work because it happens my
[time=3110] secretary could give you examples of that the people who work for me could give you examples of that the people who go on vacation with me could give you examples of that it happens everywhere as soon as a shift in my soul moves from
[time=3123] I am no longer on the planet for everybody else I am suddenly on the planet for me even if it's just a small little part of what I'm hoping for today if anybody steps in the way of that small little part I will see the level of
[time=3137] demandingness in my soul and they will feel it and it's the wrong way somehow
[time=3144] there's a shift I go from servant let me give you servanthood desiring that it could be different embracing the pain of the disappointment that it's not different and yet moving not with manipulation but with love into another person's life it's 945 they're out again here's a godly response
[time=3164] dog got it in my own mind why are they out of bed again this really bums me out
[time=3170] I really was hoping for a little time this is very disappointing major day tomorrow I feel like I'm tapped good night why couldn't it be good night embrace
[time=3182] that look at that refuse now to demand that I get my way instead commit to
[time=3189] minister to the whoever it is and it with a genuine heart of love in weakness
[time=3195] second Corinthians 12 feeling like there's nothing in me left but oh God give me something in humility submitting to what this situation is in my life say let
[time=3206] me hope you get into bed and maybe they need discipline but maybe that discipline needs to come out of a heart that isn't defending my territory but is genuinely concerned for their best interest and they know the difference by the way do you understand I want you to think about your areas of disappointment
[time=3221] I want you to think about the places that you really grieved in your heart that aren't working the way you want them to work and I'd love for you to try to categorize yourself am I desiring that it could be different but submitting to
[time=3235] the will of God for my life drawing upon his power and seeking to love the people in that situation category a category b am I the kind of what do you mean disappointment I don't I don't much ever get disappointed well that may be an indicator you're in the denial category I don't do disappointment you know oh really well you're a little bit different Jesus was a little bit different Paul was a little bit different than anybody else I can point to it all the word of God you don't do disappointment hmm maybe we should talk about that
[time=3266] probably reveals that you're rather shallow and your relationships are rather shallow and people don't get impacted in a strong way by you because you're not in touch with reality and you're not in touch with them and their reality and sympathy and empathy and mutual hurt yeah you don't do good at that you kind of float around the edges and on the top maybe you're right here in James 4 and you go man this is me this is me if you're gonna define
[time=3296] seeking my own pleasures as something other than an orgy and something other than sexual drunkenness and something other than rampant rank materialism I mean if you're gonna say and if the Bible's gonna tell me that I can have something as noble as ministering my spiritual gifts having my kids turn out right having whatever it is a good job if if that categorizes under the heading
[time=3320] of pleasures of hedonism well then that's me this me then it's worse just like
[time=3329] the text says I want it I want it so bad I lust after it that's not a sexual word necessary that's just an impassioned desire and I'm hot in pursuit of getting what I want and when I don't people get in my way and I become angry and I fight and I quarrel with it yep that's me man you know what if you can come to that point that's a good point. That's growth that's maturity. God can
[time=3358] begin to do some exciting things in your life if you can get to that point. So I got to stop now because I'm out of time and that's okay you've probably heard enough. Next time we meet we'll go ahead a little further in this text by way of
[time=3372] application let me just invite you to do do this this week when you come in to
[time=3378] disappointment and you will of one kind or another here in the next seven days I want you to think about the three D's am I desiring that this situation could
[time=3387] change and go in your mind a second Corinthians 12 oh look at me I'm not even feeling it I'm in denial I refuse to feel the pain I don't want to feel pain so I just don't am I demanding am I angry and are people in my life getting
[time=3404] singed talk with God about that that'll be a good conversation. Well
[time=3415] discouragement is a difficult thing and I know that all of us face it I have it in my life and I'm sure you have it in yours and if like the woman at the well you're ready to face the hardship of your life and give your life to Jesus Christ and drink of the living water which gives real purpose and meaning we'd invite you to bow your head at this point and pray to receive Jesus Christ Father I know that I have sought other places for fulfillment I know that that
[time=3442] comes only through the person of Jesus Christ and I accept Him today as my Savior and give my life completely to Him acknowledging that I can only be satisfied in the person of Jesus Christ. I pray these things in His name amen. If
