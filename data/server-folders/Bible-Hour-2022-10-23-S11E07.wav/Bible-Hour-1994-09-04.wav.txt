[time=0] No one escapes disappointment, not even Jesus Christ in his life on earth lived without facing disappointment.
[time=8] And there is a wrong way to face disappointment and there is a right way to face disappointment.
[time=13] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and
[time=29] fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=33] Thank you for joining us.
[time=35] What do you do when you don't get what you want?
[time=38] How do you handle disappointment?
[time=40] Well today in a continuing study of the Book of James, we come to a passage of Scripture that helps us understand what to do when the hard times come, when a plane crashes and a loved one is killed, and the biopsies come back positive and dreams are shattered.
[time=55] When unexpected unemployment fills your mind with fears for the future, when an unfaithful spouse tears your heart to pieces.
[time=62] There is a right and a wrong way to respond to disappointment, and today James explains the why and how of a wrong response.
[time=71] He then gives us hope by explaining the right way.
[time=75] Let's join our service.

[time=390] [APPLAUSE]
[time=397] We'll return to the service in just a moment.
[time=399] You know, each week as you watch the Bible Hour, you've probably noticed the beautiful open Bible stained glass window on the front of our church.
[time=406] It's a symbol of our constant desire to learn more from God's Word and apply it to our daily lives.
[time=411] And now the Bible Hour is pleased to offer you this miniature replica of the Bible window on this attractive gold pin.
[time=417] It's our hope that it will serve as a reminder to you to pray for the Bible Hour.
[time=421] We're sending this pin to all our viewers who write and enclose a suggested gift of $10.
[time=426] Write us today, won't you?
[time=428] Now, let's return to our service.
[time=432] Let me invite you to come to James chapter 4 and the theme of that song.
[time=437] He's the only reason I live, but oh what a reason.
[time=440] It really is the theme of this particular text, and I just thank you guys for setting us up that way so wonderfully.
[time=447] And as we begin, I just need to give you two footnotes.
[time=450] Number one, this is part two.
[time=452] If you weren't here last Sunday, some of the things we're going to cover may not make total sense to you.
[time=457] We've laid a foundation in the previous week as we came to this text that is in some way instrumental to your understanding.
[time=463] And I just want to invite you to, if you need that help, to buy a tape through calling our church and we'll have one copied and sent to you and you can fill in the pieces.
[time=472] The second thing is I'm struggling with a cold and so my voice isn't normally this husky and deep and authoritative.
[time=479] And so if it sounds a little funny to you today, that's what's actually going on.
[time=482] I didn't have an operation and I haven't had any changes that I know of.
[time=485] It's just a cold.
[time=487] I also want to say thanks for the beautiful flowers in appreciation for our 14th anniversary.
[time=493] It's just a gorgeous little beautiful thing of flowers, the only thing I can think of.
[time=498] Now watch this.
[time=499] That is more beautiful than these flowers is my wife Heidi.
[time=504] [AMEN] And I do mean that.
[time=511] That'd be anniversary honey, no card now, I've done my thing.
[time=514] (Laughter) James chapter four.
[time=522] We've got a question on the table here.
[time=524] What do you do when you don't get what you want?
[time=528] How do you respond to disappointment in your life when your kids don't turn out the way you want them to?
[time=533] Your husband doesn't love you as he ought to.
[time=536] You lose your job, your sense of financial security and you're not sure about your financial future.
[time=542] You have scars that you're bringing with you from your childhood because you were mistreated and abused and you have tried and you've talked and you've prayed and yet you can't escape the haunting memory and you'll carry them wherever you go into every relationship and to every situation in your life and you wish you could be rid of them but they are dogging you and tracking you.
[time=562] What do you do when you look at your life to this point and you look back and you go that's not at all what I was hoping would have happened by now and I see no real prospects for the future to significantly change it and bring it in the line?
[time=576] What do you do from minor disappointments to the weather won't cooperate with your recreational plans to the dinner was burned and it doesn't taste the way it ought to to major significant issues such as we've raised even here?
[time=588] No one escapes disappointment, not even Jesus Christ in his life on earth lived without facing disappointment
[time=594] and there is a wrong way to face disappointment and there is a right way to face disappointment we've been giving the last couple of weeks here last in this week the three D's just for a memory cue
[time=605] of how to handle disappointment there are three basic ways that people respond to disappointment the first which we looked at last week is to desire that things could be different and this by the way is the only godly response that comes out of 1 Corinthians 12 and we won't turn there again
[time=621] but we find Paul in this situation in a tremendously disappointing event in his life he's been plagued by a messenger from Satan the thorn in his flesh he's asked God to take it away but God has refused to do that and he's left to live his life and to deal with the reality of this enormous disappointment and Paul was not accustomed to having his prayers going answered he was a miracle worker Acts 20 reports that he could just ask God for things and people would be healed but his own problem which we're not really sure what it was God leaves in his life and so he lays out this marvelous example and as we looked at that text we found that Paul was humbled by the disappointment by the pain
[time=660] he fully embraced it he squared up on it and said I don't like what you're doing in my life I wish you were gone I've asked God three times to take you away he hasn't but you're here and I embrace the disappointment that you represent but he goes a step beyond that because that could just lead to self-pity and he draws upon the power of God to continue to live in the midst of that disappointment in a powerful and a meaningful way for other people to the glory of God and there it is in a nutshell he says when I am weak then I am strong and so he's saying there I would rather be weak in the admission that I can't get my life to work I can't even get God to make my life work the way I want it to work and so I am humbled and weakened and broken under the enormity of this disappointment and in that position of weakness I draw upon the power of God and I live with real meaning and purpose for the glory of God by serving other people the second D which is a million miles away from that is to deny that these disappointments are as bad as they are and many of us are committed not to feeling the brunt of disappointment and the pain of past events and current events and even the fear of future negative events
[time=733] and so we have taken what God has given us and what it means to be humans and our imaginations and our ability to block things out and our ability to shift things around and we just deny that it is as disappointing as it actually is and we just constantly mitigate the importance of that event in our life because we don't want to feel the pain of it and we think that that's a reasonable solution because in the short term it seems to work it's in a small way functional we can get on with the day at least but like a pipe that is leaking underneath the faucet
[time=765] we see it's there we don't want to deal with it and we shut the cover door and we go on with our day but it continues to drip and to leak and the problem is in no way dealt with and it comes back worse and it has a far more negative impact on us eventually than if we would just have dealt with it as Paul did in 1 Corinthians 12 we remember that the whole point of coming to Christ from John 4 and the woman at the well and so that she could worship Christ in spirit and in truth meaning reality embracing all that her life was with her five husbands and her new live-in
[time=799] and all the disappointments and the herd and the pain and the thirst that could never be satisfied by life neither man nor woman nor human being could satisfy that woman's desires and so Christ invites her to acknowledge that fact that life is empty apart from Christ and live in the pain and draw upon the power of Christ
[time=819] to live effectively for other people so the second D is denial the third which is the one which James talks about here at length in fact he gives us the anatomy of this is demanding that things change the third D is to demand that things change to try to take things into our own power and we will work them out in ways that we like even if it kills us and so in the anatomy of that demanding spirit James reveals three parts in this passage verses one to ten the first is what is a demanding spirit how do I know what it is give me a description of it secondly the consequences of a demanding spirit which is very telling and then last the cure thankfully of a demanding spirit how to respond to that when we see it in ourselves this will still be reviewed for just a minute now so what is a demanding spirit there are three words in the first two verses of James chapter four powerful words which give wonderful description to a demanding spirit the first in verse one your pleasures I think the NIV says desires it's the Greek word hedonon and it's the word from which we get hedonite or hedonistic and it is someone who lives for pleasure the highest priority in life is to get what they want to have it the way they want it to be the strong desire to please yourself the second word comes in the beginning of verse two you lust I think the NIV says you want and do not have that word is epithumia it's the strongest word in all the New Testament for desires that have run out of control they are inordinate desires run away desires all consuming passions that seem to eclipse any other passion any other thought any other priority you are enraged and inflamed with the desire to see your pleasures met so it escalates and then there's this third word envious or again I think it's want in the NIV and you are envious or you want and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel another word in the New Testament which means to desire with a hot passion to possess I mean you've got it in sight you know what it is and you're longing to have it as you want it Now typically when we come to these words we can think in terms of illegitimate sinful desires the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life and we tend to category this passion for things like opulent materialism or for alcohol so we can deaden the effect of our life and we want to get drunk with that stuff and it's an obsessive passion that we call those people alcoholics or sex and people who want to just pursue sex above everything else or fame or glory or position or power and typically we tend to think of these things in the negative immoral realm alright and that's legitimate that's part of it but that's not all of it and the place that it immediately intersects with our lives basically as born-again believers is when we attach this kind of energy this passion and this lusting and this desiring for legitimate things things which the Bible tells us to strive after things which the Bible holds up as virtuous such as having your kids turn out right that's a noble goal that's a noble desire that's a reasonable aspiration in life when you set it as the highest priority when you set it as the passion of your life and become hedonistic in your desire and become yourself pleased because your kids turned out right and you lust after it you are in sin even though the goal itself is moral how your husband treats you being able to provide for your family being able to minister your spiritual gifts in the body of Christ being able to be healthy enough to carry on the affairs of your life these are legitimate goals they become sinful when in your heart you set them above God and you begin to want them more than you want God himself any desire other than that for God moral or immoral that reaches this fever pitch in your life is out of bounds you say well that's hard to discern I mean you're talking about things that are worth working for that's true your kids your husband your marriage your job how do I know when I have crossed the bound excuse me the boundary marker how do I know when I'm out of bounds I've actually placed that as in the place of God in my life well the text will give you three ways to indicate it these are true these are faithful these are reliable the first one is found in verse 1 you these things wage war in your members see at the end of verse 1 pleasures that wage war in your members you have no contentment there is strife in your life there is anxiety in your life and you are a churning cauldron of anxiety over how in the world am I going to get my pleasures met and it becomes kind of an all consuming thought process in your life and everything that comes into your life is evaluated by whether or not it will contribute to your pleasure whether or not it adds to it or subtracts from it whether or not it perpetuates it or diminishes it and you are in constant conflict with yourself trying to seek the fulfillment of these even noble goals that's indicator number one indicator number two is that you will find yourself in conflict with other people look at verse 2 you lust you strongly desire lust by the way doesn't always have to be sexual lust is just a strong passion for anything it's even you sometimes of God a strong passion for God which is the only appropriate one you lust and do not have so you commit murder and you are envious and cannot obtain so you fight and quarrel that's describing a relational breakdown to say the least I mean when you murder somebody that's a pretty big violation of your relationship with him but it doesn't have to go all the way to murder in the Sermon on the Mount in the book of Matthew Jesus says if you're angry with someone in your heart you may as well have murdered them you have violated your commitment to love another person when you are angry with them and it is the beginning of the continuum that leads to murder and so you are guilty as if you had murdered them in the eyes of God you know you are out for your own desires and your own pleasures as opposed to the passionate pursuit of God when you find yourself in quarrels and fighting that are perpetuated by an angry heart to fight and quarrel by the way does not mean that you are yelling at people striking people and hitting people because that's how some of us fight and quarrel others of us fight and quarrel in a very quiet silent manipulative way and we make our point and we destroy our relationships and we get back at people in very subtle quiet ways so don't think you're relieved here of this category of evaluation because you don't punch and fight and yell and scream and your anger is an open many people are driven by a very hot seething anger within them which shuts them down and isolates people and they are as damaging to relationships as those who are more vocal both are sin both reveal a wrong priority in your life the passionate pursuit of God so one you will find conflict in yourself two you will find conflict with others in your heart burning anger fighting and quarreling thirdly you will find conflict in your relationship with God let me say this to you you do not treat people one way and God another way when you are running on the agenda of getting your needs met when the issue in your life is getting life to work the way you want it to work you do not shift in and out of that mode just because you're praying just because you're sitting in a pew just because you're studying the Bible just because you're preaching the Bible just because you're listening to the Bible if that is your agenda the fact that you're expressing it with people or with God it doesn't change the agenda in one sense God is the awesome creator the unfathomable initiator of all these things who always was and who always will be he is holy he is transcendent he is totally other he is totally supreme in another sense he is just another of the relationships in your life and you will treat him the way you treat everybody else and if you are in a selfish agenda mode he will get that the same way as everybody else now look at it at the end of verse 2 down to verse 6 here comes the way it violates your relationship with God you do not have because you do not ask the end of verse 2 now verse 3 you ask and do not receive because you ask with wrong motives so that you may spend it on your pleasures you adultresses do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God?
[time=1355] therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God now verse 5 is one of the most difficult verses to translate in the entire New Testament I will give it to you the way that I think it should be translated verse 5 or do you think that the scripture speaks to no purpose?
[time=1371] he meaning God jealously desires the spirit the human spirit which he has made to dwell in us we will come back to that later verse 6 but he gives a greater grace therefore it says God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble now I want you to notice a sequence here and you will see how this impacts your relationship with God probably much the way it does mine in a very negative way we have got some strong desires over verses 1 and 2 we know how we want our life to work out oftentimes our desires because we are believers are very noble in nature they are not for illicit sin they are for good things we elevate those desires above our pursuit of God we begin to live for a life that looks the way we want it to look as a result we take matters into our own hands and we try to orchestrate that life to accomplish that so we begin to manipulate people verse 2 and when you manipulate people you are in their life for yourself they don't cooperate and you get mad at them for that you then begin to fight in quarrel with them quietly or overtly and as a result of the universe 2 you are not even asking God for any help in this whole matter because it's up to you you figure you're big enough you're strong enough you'll figure it out and so there's no request even for help of God at this point in the process but eventually you come to the realization you can't control these things you are not big enough you are not strong enough you are not powerful enough you have tried your best to get your kids to turn out right and they don't you have done everything in your power positive and negative to get your husband to love you the way he wants you to but you just can't seem to get inside of his heart and make him do it you've worked as hard as you possibly can at your job to make it fulfilling to make it rewarding and it just isn't and there aren't any other opportunities as hard as you have looked it's outside of your control or yeah you did get fired and there's nothing you can do about it we eventually, because we are finite human beings and this whole thing is a lot bigger than we are we eventually come to the place where we recognize we just simply can't pull it off but we're not done trying we've got one more place to look and it's got himself so in verse 3 we start the prayer process you ask in other words you ask to get what you want you ask for the fulfillment of your pleasures and your wanting and your envious you call them good things you say just so Lord my kids would come out right just so Lord my husband would love me just so Lord this situation will work out to your glory see you ask but you don't get it verse 3 why? because you ask with wrong motives so that you may spend it on your pleasures asking for noble things so that you can feel better about yourself so that your life can work the way you want your life to work and God says uh-uh we're not going down that path I'm not going to work with you like that that is not how we are going to learn to treat each other you see God refuses to be turned into a cosmic vending machine where we work really hard and we do we know we want we want joy and we want happiness and we want a positive self-image and we just figure if our kids husband job ministry will work out the way we want then we'll have that joy and that happiness we know what we want we can see it we know he's got the power to give it to us and so we get our little spiritual vending machine coins out our obedience and our prayer and we're figuring we can obligate God we can give him enough prayer enough obedience enough Bible study enough whatever it is giving to the church and we pop our little coins in the vending machine and we select our selection happy kids happy home life happy job and we're expecting that God is going to let this stuff fall out the bottom we can grab what we want and say thanks I'll be back later when I need some more stuff and God goes we're not into that that is not how we're going to play this game he said I thought we entered into a love relationship where you loved me and I loved you and there were no conditions there were no obligations and you came to me for me you came to love me as the loving creator of the heavens of the earth not for what you could get from me some of us are thinking come on let's not get overboard here I mean are you trying to say that it's unreasonable for us to ask that God would help us with our kids is it unreasonable for us to ask that God would help us with our husbands?
[time=1658] I mean what are you saying here I'm saying it's very reasonable for you to ask for those things with a humble submissive heart desiring that not demanding it but God knows the difference when you're asking and you'll be okay without it it'll hurt but you'll still love him God and he knows when you're asking him for your own pleasures so that you consume it on your motives see he can see all that stuff in us we can't fool him and when he sees it he not only says no verse 3 he doesn't give it to you look what he says in verse 4 this is a scorching hot verse he says you adulterous do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility with God therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God when you come to me asking me for things so that you can have a happy life you prostitute our relationship you take it to a very dirty and a very base and a very immoral level where I become your servant and I exist in your life to give you what you want and you adulterate you commit sexless adultery with God actually with the things of the world but God's a partner in it all look at it in verse 4 do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God?
[time=1743] therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God you see how it destroys your relationship with God?
[time=1749] not in the sense that you lose your salvation but there is enmity where there used to be peace practical enmity not positional enmity what's friendship with the world?
[time=1760] friendship with the world is any time you go to God to get what you want out of God and that's all the pagans have ever done the ancient mind who didn't understand why a volcano erupted all he knew is when it does it screws up his crops he doesn't know why the thunderstorm comes he just knows that that messes up his crops he doesn't know why the whole thing happens the way it does so he figures I've got to control this because every time it goes wrong it messes up my life so I'm going to make a God a God of the volcano and a God of the rain and a God of the sun and a God of the crops and a God of the fertility and we'll just worship those gods how we will offer things to them and obligate them we'll give them so much we'll be so right we'll be so submissive that they have to turn life out in ways that we want them to so the volcano won't erupt so the crop will grow so that these calves will reproduce and will get what we want God says when you come to me the right and true and living God not an idol the God who in fact does control all that stuff and can produce all those results when you come to me with that desire in your heart to get control of your life to make it work the way you want it to fit it within negotiable boundaries of what you think is a reasonable tolerance of pain and joy in your life so that I can solve those problems you adulterate our relationship and you have made friends with the world you are now like any other pagan worshipper and I'm not into it he's saying I don't buy it I won't be a part of it look at verse 5 this is what he wants or do you think that the scripture speaks to no purpose he jealously desires the spirit smallest human spirit which he has made to dwell in us what's he saying what I want out of this whole thing my whole redemptive scheme all of creation all that I'm doing in space and time do you know what I really want out of this whole thing I just want you I just want you to love me for who I am and I want to just love you despite what you are I just want to be involved in an unconditional love relationship where you recognize who I am and what I am and the worthiness that I am to receive the glory and the honor and the praise and I just want you to worship me for what I am not what I can give you and I refuse to settle for anything less in our relationship that is so inviting I was trying to think of a way to illustrate this and the thing that came to my mind over and over again this week was is my daughter Whitney four daughters the youngest of four is Whitney she's about four years old and from the time she was old enough to like walk and think and talk she has had this insatiable desire to be with me it's marvelous I don't deserve it but if I'm going somewhere her question is may I come with you if I'm in the garage, clean the garage she's in the garage messing up the garage but she's with me if I'm out in the yard working she sits right in the middle she wants to be right there with me if I got a haul something to the dump she wants to come with me she can be exhausted wiped out totally tired by the time we're done falling asleep on that seat over there and the next day she wants to go again I don't buy her treats I don't buy her malts french fries candies nothing there's no perks when she comes she just comes she just absolutely wants to be with me she was sitting watching a thing down the hall to the master bedroom and without turning to see I just gently was shutting the door behind me and it wouldn't shut it just wouldn't shut and so I background I look and there's Whitney in the door holding it because she wanted to follow me no one was I didn't even know where I was going didn't even talk to her she just sees me because I want to be with him and so she follows me that's what God wants that's what God wants God just wants you to follow him wherever he's going no perks no extras no french fries no candies no nothing just follow him just a tune the spirit that he has put within you the human spirit and fix it on him and say I'm with you I want to be wherever you are I want to go wherever you lead you are the passion of my life I believe that's what verse 5 means now what happens when we don't do that what happens when we want to reduce him to a cosmic vending machine look at verse 6 it says but he gives a greater grace therefore it says God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble do you know what people are called when they disenfranchise themselves from submission to God to following his will to submitting to his leadership and try to work things out on their own that's called pride that's called independence and when you get in that mode and try to draw him into that with you so that he becomes available to your beck and call he opposes you again you don't lose your salvation you can't in a practical day-to-day sense you can't change yourself against something God stations himself against you and your agenda he becomes your active antagonist and he says there is no possible way I'm going to acquiesce acquiesce to that kind of relationship with you I love you too much you're better than that the dynamics of our relationships will be better I will not function on those terms it's as if he's saying to us when we're in this mode you want me to prove my goodness on your terms but if I yield to your demand you will not trust me you will rather come to think you own me nothing could be worse for your spiritual growth development and wholeness to grant you this request would only lead you into a more self-centered lifestyle of independence and pride so instead I order myself in front of your wishes and I oppose you so how do I know if I have taken noble goals legitimate desires and elevated them to the passionate pursuit of my life in a way that they usurp God and even try to use God to get what I want for myself number one I'll be torn up inside there will be no contentment I'll be full of anxiety number two I'll be full of anger at the people who don't acquiesce to my manipulation to the people who stand in the way of the fulfillment of my goals and I will fight and I will quarrel overtly or invertly the ruckus but I will fight and in that mode I won't even be asking for God and his help because I'm still under the illusion that I can get it done myself when finally I come to the realization that I can't I will ask for his help and he will refuse to answer because he can see the condition of my motives my heart is wrong and all I want to do is spend it on myself that means I'm adulterating and prostituting my relationship with God I'm making friends with the world and reducing this whole thing to a pagan level and God says wait a minute there was a whole lot more here intended than me being your little waiter or waitress to give you your desires I was really hoping we could be in an unconditional love relationship where we connect somewhere profound in our love for each other independent of the way I happen to orchestrate the events of your life and so he says reluctant to give up that opportunity for a real relationship and then I arrange and I station myself in opposition to you and to your agenda that's love I guess that's called tough love that's powerful stuff now what isn't in this text
[time=2281] that I want to try to add to if you come when they keep a finger here if you come with me to the book of a moment I want to try to put some flesh and blood on this thing last time I tried to give you an illustration out of my own life and how I can violate the people in my home around bedtime when I want those last couple of hours for myself and if people infringe on the pursuit of that pleasure as reasonable as it may be a time to rest and rekindle for the next day's work how I can become angry and fight and quarrel and abusive not physically or anything just as God would intend it I feel as though I'm violating that relationship with my kids but now let's look at another example Psalm 73 and you're going to see this faulty reasoning and you're going to see a man move through a process to this point where God intends he says in Psalm 73 verse 1 surely God is good to Israel to those who are pure in heart now that's a little bit of a signal right up front to those who are pure in heart to those who have the spiritual coins to put in the vending machine of God surely God is good to Israel to those who have come prepared to deposit the proper number of coins now listen to his dilemma as for me my feet came close to stumbling my steps had almost slipped in other words he's saying I almost gave up on my faith I almost walked away entirely from the God of Israel why?
[time=2374] verse 3 I was envious of the arrogant I saw the prosperity of the wicked for there are no pains in their death and their body is fat and they are not in trouble as other men nor are they plagued like mankind and he's talking about the wealthy here who are able to insulate themselves by virtue of their money from many of the common pains and troubles of life as particularly in that day and even in our own we recognize a vast difference of life and ease that comes from living in an impoverished state in the inner city with all of its disease and its dilapidated housing and its poor food conditionings and bad sanitary conditions to those who would have millions of dollars that could isolate themselves on estates and have servants at their beck and call that's what he's talking about I don't understand I'm almost ready to walk away from the God of Israel because I look at the wealth of the arrogant and the pain in their death their body is fat and they're not in trouble just beyond that they're wicked in their hearts look at verse 6 their pride is their necklace I mean they seem to flaunt this stuff about and their garment of violence covers them they seem to have no embarrassment that they've killed people to come to this position of power and prominence and wealth and their eye bulges from fatness they're so indulged and self-indulged and greedy for the next thing they can get their hands on bulge with desires and wants the imaginations of their heart run riot they can't seem to stop from thinking of the next pleasure and imagining the next pleasure and living vicariously through their own imagination the next level of opulence and self-indulgence and then they mock verse 8 and wickedly speak of oppression they speak from on high they have set their mouths against the heavens and their tongue parades through the earth you see they even give articulation and philosophy to the way they live verse 11
[time=2493] what do they say?
[time=2495] how do they justify themselves? they say this how does God know?
[time=2499] and is their knowledge with the most high in other words you people who think your God is sufficient how come he doesn't work it out in space and time for you how come you're at the bottom rung of society and we the ones who mock him are at the top where is your knowledge with the most high what good does it do you?
[time=2519] verse 13 here he comes to the bottom rock of his heart surely in vain I have kept my heart pure and washed my hands in innocence for I have been stricken all day long and chastened every morning he's thinking to himself what in the world am I doing following God?
[time=2535] this has got to be the most pointless endeavor of my life I come to him time and time again and the spiritual coins I deposit them in the vending machine I make my selection of what comes out at the bottom isn't what I wanted it's verse 14 I'm stricken all day long and chastened every morning he gives me hardship and these wicked people live in opulence and splendor that makes no sense to me you see why he's all ready to slip?
[time=2561] you see why he's all ready to become an apostate and walk away from God?
[time=2565] verse 16 when I pondered to understand this it was troublesome in my sight until I came into the sanctuary of God then I perceived their end surely thou dost set them in slippery places thou dost cast them down the destruction how they are destroyed in a moment they are utterly swept away by sudden terrors like a dream when one awakens old lord when aroused thou out the spies their form in other words he's saying oh I get it there's more going on here than meets the eye life isn't just the 73 years I get to live here they're beyond the façade of their apparent ease that doesn't necessarily mean that you love them and are supporting them in fact when I look past the façade of their existence I see their in their slippery places their destruction and how they will be utterly swept away and how you in fact will despise even their form you'll annihilate them oh I get it their circumstantial blessing doesn't mean that you love them and are supporting them in their defiance of you but it doesn't seem to answer the problem in his own heart what about his stricken condition what about his mourning what about his chastening how is he to perceive that how is he to live with the painful condition of his own life verse 25 he says whom have I in heaven but thee?
[time=2650] and besides thee I desire nothing on earth he is saying the exciting thing of heaven isn't the streets of gold and the pearly gates and the possibility of living with a redeemed fully glorified body that will never be sick the exciting reality of heaven is you you are what is making heaven so remarkable and fittingly I besides thee I desire nothing on earth there it is all the passion in my heart is centered on God all the passion in my heart for how I will live today in this earth and on this earth and in my 73 years is all about God and I understand that all my passion in heaven will be fulfilled in the person of God verse 26 listen to how unconditional he says my flesh and my heart may fail in other words this may consume my very body existence not just the circumstances of my life but my life itself but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever 28 but as for me the nearness of God is my good I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of all thy works there it is he goes from a demanding spirit an accusative tone against God for allowing others to have more circumstantial blessing than he has cursing himself for having been as religious as he was in devotion to God because it reveals that he thought that his devotion would produce physical circumstantial blessing operating on that wrong and sinful premise his own selfish motives he draws improper conclusions about God and it isn't until he relinquishes God from that pseudo responsibility that imposed responsibility God has never promised you or me circumstantial blessing he has only promised to exalt Christ through our lives that is his only agenda his only agenda is that every knee should bow to Christ that's it including ours not just at salvation but every day bowing our knees to exalt Christ my life is nothing to me though I should perish my flesh and my heart would fail so long as God gives me the strength I can live for him and through him look at the end of the psalm again the end of verse 28 that I may tell of all thy works guess what that is that's what we sang about this morning that's evangelism that I might proclaim the glory of God so others can worship him even as I do so he moves from a demanding confused condition impugning the character of God at hostility with God at enmity with God to a brokenness and he understands the core reality of life both here and in heaven is an unconditional love relationship with God back to James 4 you say how do I get there how do I want to be like that guy in psalm 73 I'm not like that guy I want to get like that guy I hear what you're saying Russell I see the anger in my life I see the fighting I see the quarreling I see how quickly I can boil over I understand I can feel the passion in me to have life the way I want it even the thought that it wouldn't work out the way I want it terrifies me I understand and feel the opposition of God in my life he doesn't give me what I ask for and I understand it's because I'm asking with wrong motives how do I get to the place where I can just pursue him for who he is that's verses 7, 8, 9 and 10 there are five five points that come out of this and just quickly number one, submit there for to God submit, place yourself under submit to God submit to any authority that God has put in your life submit to his will surrender your fascination with yourself to a more worthy preoccupation with the character and purpose of God say I am not the point God my happiness is not the point God my life the way I want it is certainly not the point you are the point I exist for you, you don't exist for me break your heart in submission underneath God's will and person for your life does that mean that you don't work for change?
[time=2914] does that mean that you don't work to invest in your kids in such a way that they will turn out right?
[time=2918] does that mean that you don't continue to love your husband as 1 Peter 3 does with a quiet and gentle spirit hoping that somehow you might win your husband yes you do all that stuff but you do it with an attitude of submission with the attitude that says even if that doesn't happen and it hurts me even more deeply than it does today I refuse to manipulate you God and I refuse to manipulate people in my life to get what I want I'll be okay it'll hurt like a big bad dog but I'll be okay because I have you number 2 verse 7 resist the devil resist the devil and he will flee from you the agenda that the devil had in the garden of Eden is the same one he has right here in this verse in the garden he said to the woman has God said has God really said that you shall not eat for the tree of good and evil in other words he calls in the question the goodness of God why would God do that? God obviously is not as good as you think he is you need to take matters into your own hands Eve move into the proud independent state of getting life to work the way you wanted to work on your terms he invites you to come right back the devil does to the beginning of the process in 4-1 get those pleasures figured out get your sights set on what you want and then do whatever you've got to do to get it and God says resist that scheme of the devil it's destroyed Adam and Eve it's destroyed every human being since only the redeeming love of God can snatch you from that that sinful way of thinking don't find life on your own outside of Christ verse 8 draw near to God and he will draw near to you now that's a switch up there in verse 6 he's in he's ordering himself in opposition against you now in verse 8 he's coming towards you he's moving into your life that's right it says in Jeremiah 29-13 you will seek me and find me when listen to this you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart when I'm really what you're after not what you can get out of me when I'm really what you're after not the blessings that I can give when I am really all you're after you will find me because I'll find you I'll come after you there'll be nothing that'll keep us apart practically experientially I'll be there that doesn't mean that these problems go away to find God again don't be warped in your thinking to find God does not mean that your problems go away to find God means that you've found God and that God may allow all those problems to sit just as they are he may allow them to intensify that's a different issue he is not a vending machine he is a person who you need to pursue passionately then the next step step four is repent cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your heart you double-minded be miserable and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy to gloom you say repent of what good night that's some pretty serious repent language what have we done had sexual orgies murdered people stolen from the bank no all you've done is violated yourself verse one repent that you've prostituted yourself to get what you want and set as your highest goal your own pleasure repent of that secondly repent of all the relational violations in your life repent of the anger and the fighting and the coring and go to those people and make it right and be submissive under God's will for you and for them repent and thirdly and most importantly repent before God seek his forgiveness for committing sexless adultery with the things of the world even though they're normal even though they're moral even though they're good things that you've wanted you've been involved in sexless sexless adultery and he says cleanse your hands purify your heart you double-minded am I enough for you or aren't I are you going to seek me or seek things through me which is it going to be are you going to love me even though your world's falling apart or aren't you don't be double-minded verse nine be miserable and mourn and weep meaning let it impact you how sinful you've been how sinful I've been in my relationship with God and let your laughter be turned into mourning in your joy to gloom the point is this when broken under his will when resisting the allurement to run your own life as it comes through Satan when then seeking God and God alone with all your heart
[time=3203] and you're finally in his presence then just lay it all out and confess the sin of your selfishness and your pride and your independence
[time=3213] verse ten humble yourself humble yourself in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you guess what he just told us how to do it see the humble at the end of verse six God gives grace to the humble see humble yourselves in verse ten that's kind of like bookends and everything in between is how to humble yourself you humble yourself by submitting to God resisting the devil drawing near to God and cleansing your hands it's a wonderful thing Isaiah 66 2 says for my hand made all these things thus all these things came into being declares the Lord talking about the creation I did all this stuff see all this stuff I did all that's how awesome I am that's how big I am that's how much better than you I am but he says to this one will I look I'll give special attention to this one who is that to him who is humble and contrite of spirit and who trembles at my word humble yourself in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you it says at the end of verse ten exalt you today solve your problems today make you happy today give you all you want today no we're back in the vending machine mode what he's promising is that when life is over here on earth he will exalt you into the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ and then and forever all your longings and desires will be forever met until then until then humble yourself and willfully and joyfully submit to the disappointments in your life allowing the pain in them to drive you back to God in a powerful way so that in your weakness you can find his strength and live with purpose and meaning to pursue the people in your world for his glory let's pray together
