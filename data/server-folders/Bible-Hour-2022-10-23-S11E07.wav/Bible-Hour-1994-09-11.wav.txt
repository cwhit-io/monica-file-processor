[time=0] But after I'm gone I want you to do three basic things, I want you to dream great dreams.
[time=9] I want you to pray great prayers and I want you to love me with a great love.
[time=27] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=33] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=35] Thank you for joining us.
[time=37] With the cross no more than 24 hours away, Jesus held a final meeting with His beloved
[time=43] men.
[time=44] He told them that after He was gone, He wanted them to do three things.
[time=49] Dream great dreams, pray great prayers, and love Him with a great love.
[time=56] God stands as the challenge that Pastor Moore brings to the Blackhawk family today as they begin a 10 week series on the mission of their church.
[time=64] Stay with us for an exciting challenge from God's Word.
[time=67] Our special music today will be provided by Denise Mitchell.
[time=73] Let's join our service.
[time=86] I lift thy voice in singing to you all.
[time=100] I join creation in song.
[time=106] I learn the melody, the song you give to me.
[time=112] Lord of God that you sing, Lord of God that you sing, Lord of God, and Lord of God we
[time=123] sing.
[time=124] Lord, I sing your mighty praise, Lord of God that you sing, Lord of God I sing your mighty
[time=132] praise.
[time=133] Lord, I sing your mighty praise.
[time=141] Lord, Jesus Christ is God, and I will be able to sing, we will be the sing of our
[time=151] Lord, I sing your mighty praise, Lord, I sing your mighty praise, Lord, I sing your
[time=166] mighty praise.
[time=167] Lord, I sing your mighty praise, Lord, I sing your mighty praise, Lord, I sing your
[time=183] mighty praise.

[time=242] praise, Lord, I sing your mighty praise, Lord, I sing your mighty praise.
[time=266] Hi, I'm Bob Misler, and my wife and I, Mary, were one of the first founding families
[time=276] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=279] It was back in January of '69 when a small group of us started meeting for Bible study
[time=285] on a weekly basis for the purpose of starting a church in the northeast part of Fort Wayne.
[time=293] And at that time we had been challenged by Pastor Younger of Emmanuel Baptist Church.
[time=302] The church needed to spread into the different areas of Fort Wayne.
[time=306] We were excited, and yet we were apprehensive about it, but as we began to meet on a weekly
[time=313] basis, we began to dream, plan.
[time=317] We would discuss how we would start, what kind of a church we'd like to have, the kind of pastor we wanted, and where we could meet.
[time=326] One night that I remember in particular it was such an exciting night, we had had Pastor Jeremiah here to candidate and had issued a call to him, and he had promised us an answer
[time=336] by a certain time that night.
[time=338] And so we all gathered at the Fager's house, we put the kids to bed upstairs, and we all paced the floor, chewed our nails, and did a lot of praying while we waited for the phone to ring.
[time=347] Finally about 11 o'clock, the phone rang, and it was Pastor Jeremiah saying yes, he was willing to come, and you should have heard the cheers that broke out.
[time=356] There was such excitement, we could not wait to move on to the next step.
[time=359] Approximately four to six weeks later, the Jeremiahs were able to get a house and move
[time=365] into Fort Wayne from New Jersey.
[time=369] Of course we were excited, we had a housewarming party, showered them with groceries, we got
[time=375] together and raised some money to buy them a refrigerator for a housewarming gift.
[time=380] During the summer months of '69 there were just a lot of details that had to be put together.
[time=385] They had to get the parking lot ready, foundations laid, electricity and sewer lines and all those things.
[time=391] And finally toward the end of August, the mobile units appeared, and by this time the neighbors were getting pretty curious about what was going on.
[time=400] When four mobile homes moved on to the lot, they were a little bit nervous.
[time=404] But when we put them together, we could see that it really looked like a church building and it was exciting to see what it was going to look like.
[time=410] And during those last weeks, it was just wild.
[time=413] There were so many things to do.
[time=415] I could remember one night when there were four or five different families, all in our garage, putting chairs together, getting them ready for the services.
[time=423] And I remember when the carpet came, it was the wrong color and it was just this total panic about the wrong color.
[time=428] But the drapes came in and they were the wrong color too, however they were a perfect match with the carpet.
[time=433] So that worked out just fine.
[time=435] And the night before church was to begin, we were still in there cleaning and painting and putting up drapes and checking to be sure everything was absolutely perfect.
[time=444] It was really hard work, but everyone's spirits were high.
[time=448] And the fun and fellowship brought about a closeness that was incredible.
[time=452] After working Saturday night till midnight, we all went home hoping to get some rest before
[time=459] the first service that morning.
[time=461] Now in talking with others, none of us slept very well, but we all got there at least an hour before the service started with lots of butterflies wondering what we had forgotten.
[time=472] But we were all there anxious to see who was going to come.
[time=477] For Sunday school, we had about 38 of us and 15 visitors.
[time=482] And then for church, we had about 75 at that service.
[time=486] We had an organ and a piano.
[time=488] We had special music, and we also had a choir.
[time=493] And everyone wanted to be in the choir so they could see who the visitors were.
[time=497] And as soon as church was over, you could swoop down on the visitors and greet them and make them feel very welcome.
[time=502] So that was always a highlight of the service was to see who was there.
[time=507] And during that next three or four months, each of us had a lot of jobs, three to five jobs a piece, because we were all there was.
[time=515] We did the cleaning, we did the printing, the bulletins, we did the babysitting, and all those things that now are spread out among a number of people.
[time=524] And it was fun, we were busy, and it was exciting to see the Lord's plan coming together.
[time=531] From the very beginning, there was a philosophy of excellence that was stressed in everything that we were asked to do.
[time=539] Where it was music, teaching, visitation, administration.
[time=546] We wanted everything to be the best and present a good picture for Black Hawk.
[time=553] That first year, the Sunday School grew from an enrollment of 38 to 179.
[time=558] We had eight Sunday School classes, but during that year we grew so much that we had to add
[time=564] a portable unit in order to accommodate five more classes.
[time=569] We also had our first missionary conference that year by January and called our first missionaries who we took on for the Lordly sum of $30 a month, but it was a big step of
[time=578] faith for us.
[time=579] In May of 1970, we had our first Bible conference that was during the Memorial Day weekend.
[time=589] Also in July, we tackled our first vacation Bible school.
[time=593] Our attendance at the end of August of '70, which was the completion of one year, we were
[time=601] averaging 163 per Sunday.
[time=605] In August of '70, we had our first groundbreaking service for the new chapel, for the new sanctuary.
[time=611] Today it is the asylum.
[time=616] With that groundbreaking, Emmanuel presented to us the deed to the land, which was a tremendous
[time=624] boost for us financially.
[time=627] Earlier than before the groundbreaking, the pastor and I went to a local banker to apply
[time=634] for a loan.
[time=636] What we wanted to do is hire an architect to give us some preliminary specs on what we
[time=642] needed as far as future development.
[time=645] The banker's only comment was, "That corner is too valuable to waste on a church.
[time=652] The neighborhood is also too affluent for the situation.
[time=658] A dairy queen would look great on that corner.
[time=662] Perhaps you should sell it and consider another location.
[time=669] As you guessed, we didn't get the loan and we decided at that point that we'd do our
[time=677] banking at another bank.
[time=681] We did raise the money through our first bond program.
[time=686] The bond sales created excitement among all of us.
[time=691] None of us could go home until the last person was in to report on how many they had sold.
[time=696] It was really a fantastic experience to see God's people respond and invest their money in this mission.
[time=705] We started a lot of traditions during that first year and some of them we still carry on today.
[time=710] It became a joke with all of us that anything that we did, Pastor Jeremiah, we called our first annual this or first annual that.
[time=717] We used to have an annual all church hayride that was always a great, greatly anticipated event, a lot of fun and with a weenie roast and cider and so on.
[time=727] We had an annual missionary conference.
[time=729] We had family seminars on child rearing and things of that type.
[time=732] We have Friend Day, which we still have.
[time=735] We had a Thanksgiving potluck and prayer service, which we still carry on, and the Christmas candlelight service, Christmas Eve candlelight services began at that time as well.
[time=746] One of the traditions that we had that has fallen by the wayside that we loved was New Year's Eve.
[time=751] Everybody would get together and go to the hockey game and then we go back to the church for fun and fellowship and a time of prayer as the new year came in.
[time=758] That was always exciting.
[time=760] We never would have dreamed 25 years ago when we left Emmanuel.
[time=764] I was kicking and screaming all the way.
[time=766] To this day I can't hear, "Bless me the tie that binds without getting all teary-eyed," because we were happy at Emmanuel.
[time=772] We had a place of service there.
[time=774] We were comfortable.
[time=775] It was very hard for us to leave and go into a new venture that we had no idea how it would play out and how God would use us, and as we look back on it, how thankful we are
[time=786] that God allowed us to be a part of this ministry and to see all the things that He
[time=792] brought to fruition over these years, how He allowed the Bible hour, the Christian School, all those different ministries of the church to touch lives of people and to use it for
[time=803] the furtherance of His gospel.
[time=805] We're so thankful to be able to be a part of that and to be able to celebrate 25 years and look forward to another 25 years of serving the Lord on this corner, in this ministry that God has called us to.
[time=818] We need healing, we need power, and true love for each other.
[time=826] We have had so many big but empty words, so we come before your face, asking for your
[time=839] grace, bring your people to a state of kingdom life, restore your church again, touch your
[time=853] people once again, with your precious holy hand, we pray, let your kingdom shine upon
[time=872] this earth, through our living glorious church, not for temporary deeds, but through historical
[time=895] and high, let a mighty rushing wind blow in, touch your people once again, Lord you see
[time=919] your tired servants and the wounded broken soldiers, oh how much we need your precious
[time=929] healing hand, we need the power of the cross to be the only source for us when we rise
[time=941] up and face the battle cry, restore your church again, touch your people once again, with
[time=960] your precious holy hand, we pray, let your kingdom shine upon this earth, through our
[time=974] living glorious church, not for temporary deeds, but through historical deeds, and
[time=994] how, let a mighty rushing wind blow in, touch your people once again, let a mighty rushing
[time=1016] wind blow in, touch your people once again, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[time=1043] well that really sets the scene for what we want to try to do this morning is to begin
[time=1061] a series, a 10 week series that I know you've been anticipating about the vision for our church, and to just build upon what has already been so wonderfully said by the Mishlers and
[time=1072] through Denise and all the praise music we've had this morning, I want to ask you to come to John chapter 14, there are some, a few verses there that I really think can establish
[time=1083] themselves for us as the guiding light as we look at our church over the next 10 weeks
[time=1089] and ask God to touch our hearts once again, John chapter 14, our loving Lord Jesus Christ
[time=1097] is within 24 hours of his crucifixion, and he has gathered together his little band
[time=1105] of men for some final conversation before he approaches the cross and is crucified, and
[time=1112] there are five verses here that grab three main thoughts that as I have said, I think
[time=1118] will do us well to ponder and to think and to pray about as we anticipate the next 10
[time=1124] weeks together, there are three points that come out of these five verses, I'll say them
[time=1130] to you in advance and you look for them as I read them, our Lord gathering his little men says three things, number one guys you've got to dream great dreams, let the sky be
[time=1141] the limit on what you will need to dream for the kingdom of God, number two you need to pray great prayers, and number three you need to love me with a great love, look at
[time=1153] John 14 verse 12, he says truly truly I say to you he who believes in me the works that
[time=1160] I do, shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to the
[time=1167] Father, and whatever you ask him my name that will I do that the Father may be glorified in the Son, if you ask me anything in my name I will do it, verse 15, if you love me
[time=1183] you will keep my commandments, dream great dreams, he's sitting there with some guys who have just seen him turn water into wine, they've seen him walk on the water, they've
[time=1194] seen him feed 5,000 people really far more than 5,000 people with a few loaves and a few fish, they've seen him raise Lazarus from the dead, they've seen him heal a paralytic
[time=1205] and he is saying to them you will do greater things than I have done, and you can hear
[time=1211] him breathing passion and vision and great dreams into their very soul as they anticipate
[time=1217] his demise, what would appear to be his demise but his death and his glorious resurrection.
[time=1222] And you say how are we to understand what he means, because no man has ever done miracles like Jesus did, and the answer is obvious, he is not saying your greater works in the context of miracles, it will be a greater thing spiritually which you will do than what you have seen me do. My ministry was to the Jews and once I have gone to the Father and the Holy Spirit has come yours will be to the ends of the earth to gentile alike. Mine has
[time=1248] been within the confines of Palestine, you are called and commissioned and given authority to go to every people and every tribe on every continent, every corner in every jungle in
[time=1258] every cave of the world, you will have the entire world to reach, mine has just been Palestine.
[time=1266] And his saying over again there I will go to the Father obviously leads us to the understanding the Spirit of God will come, he even mentions the Spirit of God in that chapter coming as a comforter. And once the Holy Spirit comes and the day of Pentecost comes and people
[time=1280] can be baptized by the Holy Spirit at the point of their salvation then comes regeneration and people are made new as members of the New Covenant. And people can be sealed and
[time=1291] people can be indwelt and people can be gifted by the Holy Spirit and people can be led personally in their lives by the Holy Spirit and empowered by him for ministry. Greater works than I have ever done you will do he says to them. And in so saying he tries to fill their minds
[time=1307] with visions of great dreams for the kingdom of God. And then he says and it's obvious
[time=1314] once you start believing great things for God once you start setting your sights for things that could happen that are really beyond your own ability and they scare you to think about them. You start praying great prayers. You get down on your knees and you
[time=1330] say God there's no possible way. There's no possible way that this thing will ever come
[time=1336] to pass apart from your power. And then he says but don't do all that stuff out of obligation.
[time=1345] Don't do all that stuff out of a sense of duty or ritual or religion. Don't even do it for the unsafe do it for me. Do it because you love me. If you love me you'll keep my
[time=1357] commandments. If you love me you'll sacrifice. If you love me you'll pay the price. If you love me you'll get the job done. If you love me you'll be there when you're supposed to be there. And that's exactly what we heard from Bob and Mary. They didn't want to leave
[time=1371] a manual. They liked their fellowship. They liked their friends. Blessed be the tie that binds me is the song that they sent out as the commissioning song. And as Mary says she kissed it's hard for her to hear the song. It's a mixture of pain and joy because she didn't want to leave. But by God's grace dreaming great dreams. And you heard her say
[time=1391] we had no way to dream or imagine what God would do. When they left there they didn't think of this. They didn't think of you. Their offering was $30,000 a year. The first year
[time=1402] of Black Hawk's history. That's how much you're offering is every week around here.
[time=1407] They had no way to dream that big but they were dreaming as big as they could. You heard them mention the prayer time over and over and over again. They met to study the Bible and pray and study the Bible and pray and study the Bible and pray. And then a level of sacrifice was made in those people's lives. They mentioned to me that many of them had four, five and six jobs which included cleaning the bathrooms and getting the bulletins in
[time=1431] place and and singing in the choir and teaching the kids. I mean there was a level of sacrifice.
[time=1436] There was nothing that was going to stand in these people's way. They were going to give their all out of a deep and abiding love for Christ.
[time=1448] Amen. Great dreams. Pray, great prayers. And love Christ with a great love. And out of
[time=1457] that comes great blessing. I hope when you walked in here today you were given one of these booklets. I want you to know what you got in your hands here are some dreams that
[time=1469] are the product of some prayers and some hard work on the part of your elder board and your
[time=1475] deacons and your senior staff. These are our dreams and these are our prayers and these
[time=1481] this is an expression of our love for God and what we want you to know this morning is
[time=1487] that we are praying one of our greatest prayers is that they will become your dreams. That somehow in the next 10 weeks as we meet together and study God's Word and talk about how it might work out in our church in a new day and in a new way that somehow deep within us the spirit of God will touch each and every one of us. A fresh and anew with a profound love
[time=1509] of Jesus Christ and a willingness to sacrifice and a prayer life and a dream and a vision
[time=1515] and a hope that will take us standing on the shoulder of these faithful people into a new
[time=1522] dimension and to a new time and to a new expression. And I'm standing here on behalf of the elders
[time=1530] and the deacons and the staff to say the time has come for this church. The time has come
[time=1536] for this church to dream new dreams and to pray new prayers and to rekindle our love
[time=1542] for God. The timing is right for this for a number of reasons. Some of them are within
[time=1549] our own church, dynamics that are going on within our own church and some of them are dynamics that are going on within our culture and I'd like to spend a few moments this morning talking about those two arenas. What's going on inside of our church that would lead us to believe it's time to dream great dreams again. If you take the booklet for a minute and turn to page two and I trust you'll keep this little booklet, make it a friend of yours for the next 10 weeks, tuck it in the front of your Bible, bring it with you, I'll refer to it in every message. I invite you to read it at your earliest convenience, preferably not right now while I'm talking to you. But as soon as you get home or before you go to
[time=1586] bed, I mean read this thing and understand it because the hope is that this becomes our dream together. But what is it about the dynamics of our church that lead us to believe that today is the day to begin dreaming new dreams together? It's what they call the theoretical life cycle of the church. It doesn't happen in every church, it doesn't happen all the time but it happens enough and in enough different churches that it's worthy of our consideration and it's interesting how our church parallels this theoretical life cycle of the church.
[time=1612] In the first paragraph you'll notice the first phase of a church is typically marked by growth and excitement and evangelism and outreach and if you'll let your eyes glance down to the graph and see 1970 to 1980, that's exactly what you're looking at. You're looking at a bunch of people who started about 75 strong which is bigger than many churches in America ever get but who were filled with an excitement for growth and evangelism and outreach they've
[time=1637] been sent to this neck of the woods to reach it for Christ and by the grace of God they would do it and they did. Now within 10 years they pushed over the thousand mark up into
[time=1647] the 1200s which is just astounding now and particularly in that day when churches were
[time=1653] not getting that big. And you see that little dip, that little dip is something that God
[time=1659] did in Fort Wayne International Harvester, the largest employer of people in the city, 5000 employees laid off and people moving out and God moved the pastor David Jeremiah
[time=1671] called him out to San Diego where he's been ministering faithfully ever since and by God's
[time=1677] grace we enter a second phase of ministry. If you'll notice that second paragraph it's typically characterized by an increasing desire to take care of quote unquote what God has given us. We had a lot of people and a lot of needs and a lot of ministries to maintain and so there is an emphasis at that point on in reach and trying to grow the people up
[time=1696] and growth begins to slow in that phase and most churches can identify an event that coincides
[time=1702] with the beginning of this phase that may be the purchase of a pipe organ it may be the padding of the pews or it may be moving into a new building. And right about in the middle of this phase we moved in 1988 to this beautiful worship center and we left a Spartan convocation
[time=1716] center with its overcrowded lobbies which I never got to experience with what I've heard a lot about and I think you had a lot of fun bumping into each other back then. But the verbiage at that time and the hope at that time was that God would double our attendance when we moved into this facility. But as we look back now it may stand as a moment in
[time=1736] time that symbolized a second phase where the emphasis had become more on the edification
[time=1744] and the in reach than the outreach and a plateau began to arise and I've mentioned this to you before in 1987 and '88 attendance was 1560. The next two years in '89 and '90 it was
[time=1757] 1590. You called the new pastor and everybody showed up to see the new monkey in town kind
[time=1763] of the new circus act and so the thing went to 1700 and then we leveled out in the 1600s
[time=1769] and now we're in the mid to high 1600s and you've got about seven years there of plateau
[time=1776] which isn't uncommon in the second phase. But here's where it gets exciting. There's
[time=1783] a third phase that churches need to embrace and they are represented in the letter A and B on your graph, option A in the last paragraph. The church retools and refocuses its ministries
[time=1795] and moves back into a growth mode. Dare the thought of option B, the church would fail
[time=1803] to respond to become more focused on its internal well-being. Instead of changing and adapting
[time=1809] and moving into the future it retrenches and focuses on its internal well-being which starts a path downward as represented by the line B. And once on that path it takes exponential
[time=1820] amounts of time and talent and treasure. It's harder to reverse the momentum than ever to get it back on a growth path. Now we're not near B, giving is up in the last three and
[time=1831] four years, attendance is up, conversions are up, baptisms are up, but they're not up enough.
[time=1838] They just barely keep pace than so the concern and the opportunity and the time. The time
[time=1846] to set our hearts aflame again for what God can do in this wonderful church called Black Rock Baptist Church which he has uniquely blessed as you can see. The survey results
[time=1858] also indicate that it's time to dream new dreams and to set our hearts aflame once again.
[time=1863] Forty percent of us or 39.8 in that first pie graph represented in the dark shaded area, the darkest shaded area, have been our new to Black Hawk in the last five years. That
[time=1874] means if we were to ask you to stand up who were here new in the last five years almost half of you would stand up. How long have you been a Christian is the next question?
[time=1885] That huge white spaced area in the pie graph represents 83.8, I'm a preacher so I'll exaggerate,
[time=1893] 85% of us saved 10 years or longer with only 2% of us being saved in the last two years.
[time=1903] Somewhere somehow back through the years in this second phase as we began the plateau we stopped reaching people for Christ and the new people who come are not new believers,
[time=1914] they are already converted people who are old in the Lord to some degree and who add to this vast 85% save 10 years or longer. Nothing wrong with transfer growth many of you are
[time=1926] new and we are thankful for each and every one of you you come with talents and gifts and skills and established giving patterns, it's a blessing for a church to receive you.
[time=1934] We are thankful for you but we are not satisfied as a church and as a leadership to say then
[time=1940] okay that's it, we'll just stop winning people to Christ and we'll just plateau and wait
[time=1946] for the downward momentum to take over. Now it's time, it's really time to rekindle
[time=1954] and refocus and dream again and get the fires of our passion moving once again for the great
[time=1960] commission winning people to Christ and training them up. You can close this now for a minute
[time=1966] and we'll come back to it in a minute. There are some indicators in our culture which tell us that it's time to dream and pray and love in a renewed way. Do you realize that
[time=1977] this church started 25 years ago and the massive changes of our country began only 30 years
[time=1983] ago so we can speak of them almost as one and the same. For a number of years now men like James Dobson have been telling us you guys it's a different America. You now live, we now live in a post-Christian America and it all began about 30 years ago, well the
[time=1998] underpinnings of it before that, but the obvious open public display happened and began about 30 years ago as did our church about 30 years ago and the point I'm trying to make is it's a different America today than it was when we opened our doors across those streets.
[time=2013] It's a different unsaved person we're trying to reach. They have different problems and different issues and different world views, not the least of which is that there are no
[time=2024] moral absolutes and there is no God and we are the product of thousands and millions and billions of years of evolution. And as a result we don't have any morals anymore
[time=2035] as a country and so the divorce rate goes up 200% since we opened the doors of our church in the United States of America and in this city. I would assume in this city as well.
[time=2046] And so we have a suicide rate among teenagers going up 300% in the United States of America
[time=2052] since we opened our doors across the street. We have single parent homes on the rise at
[time=2059] 300% since we opened our doors across the street. We have problems with sexual abuse
[time=2065] and molestation and physical abuse and verbal abuse that is taking this country by storm
[time=2071] that was not the case when we opened our doors 30 years ago across the street. Less than 60%
[time=2079] of the children in America have the privilege of living with both biological parents and the home. It's a completely different mix. They're beating to the beat of a different drummer. It's time to change. We have a changeless message. We have the truth of God's word and
[time=2098] nothing changes that. People are saved by the grace of God through the sacrifice of Jesus
[time=2105] Christ as they humbly repent of their sin and fall at his feet and ask for forgiveness.
[time=2110] That never changes but the way we communicate that message to people in 1994 is different
[time=2116] than the way we were doing it in 69 and 70. It's time to change. Not our message but our
[time=2125] method. It's time to go back to the basic fundamentals of our church and the passion
[time=2131] of our heart to reach the lost but be willing to do it in ways that may be more relevant
[time=2137] to a completely different America than we had when we opened our doors. Now change is hard. Change is very hard. And no generation of people who has ever lived has ever accepted
[time=2148] change well. And we happen to be a group of people who are living on a planet and in a country that is changing more rapidly than any other group of people have ever had to confront in all their life. It is astounding the changes that are occurring in our world
[time=2165] and in our country. And we have to cope and we have to live with it and we have to understand it and we have to deal with it and we have to be effective in understanding it but we will not reach the people that God has put us on this corner to reach. I've got to kick
[time=2179] out of an article I read the other day. Listen to this, I have a newspaper article. "The world is too big for us. Too much going on. Too many crimes. Too much violence. Try as you will. You get behind in the race. It's an incessant strain to keep pace. You still lose ground. Science empties its discoveries on you so fast. You stagger beneath them and hopeless bewilderment. The political world's news is seen so rapidly you're out of breath trying to keep pace with who's in and who's out. Everything is high pressure. Human nature can't endure it much more." Now what made me laugh is this article was written in a newspaper in 1863. 1863. You see change has never been welcomed. And I'll guarantee you more changes
[time=2223] going on today than was going on in 1863. In 1857, 1857, November 13, the Boston Globe,
[time=2233] the headline reads, "Energy crisis looms. Subcaption. World may go dark since whale
[time=2240] blubber so scarce." You see, every generation has had to face it. They had no idea of the
[time=2248] new kinds of energy sources that we would be tapping into. Just like we have no idea
[time=2255] what kinds of energy sources the next generation is going to discover and use that may be more efficient and may be cleaner and there may be far greater resources from which to draw.
[time=2264] You see, change is always difficult. It's always frightening. It always brings insecurity.
[time=2269] But of all the people on the earth who should be able to cope, it's us. You want to know why? Because Daniel 2 says that it is God who changes the times and the epochs. It is
[time=2282] God who establishes the kings and removes the kings. You see, we are the ones who know
[time=2288] the God who is in control. He is our Father. He has sent His Son to die for us and He has
[time=2294] at the center of His attention, the progress and the health and the development of His bride, Jesus Christ and His Church. We are the ones who are supposed to be able to hang
[time=2305] on to a changeless God and a changeless message in a changing time with confidence and security
[time=2312] that He will go with us into a frightening future of change. One of my favorite verses
[time=2319] in Acts 13, 36, and it speaks of, you don't need to turn there, it speaks of David, the Old Testament hero who was so greatly used of God to do the things of God. It says there
[time=2330] that David served the purpose of God in his own generation. David lived in a certain time
[time=2338] and a certain place with certain people and his heart and his desire and his vision and
[time=2344] his dream was to serve the purpose of God, the unchanging purpose of God in his own generation.
[time=2354] And we are living at the top of a teeter-totter as we are shifting from one generation to
[time=2364] the next. And we will either understand this and we will embrace this and we will study
[time=2372] this and we will take our changing God and our changing message into the marketplace effectively or we will fail. Change is even hard to recognize.
[time=2389] Some years ago they, number one watchmaker in the world had a watch that ticked and had a mainspring Rolex over there in Switzerland. But they were making so much money they wanted
[time=2401] to try to stay on the cutting edge so in their research development lab they put some guys to work, figure it out where we headed and they came back not too long after that with a brand new kind of watch called the quartz movement. And they came to their executives
[time=2415] and they said you guys this is the new way to do it it's far less expensive, it's far more durable, it's a thousand times more accurate, we can mass produce them, we can storm the marketplace and the executives said no because that can't be a good timepiece.
[time=2430] It doesn't have a mainspring and it doesn't tick. And they were grabbing on to their past
[time=2436] and they were thinking about the men of old in Rolex who had designed these things and who with meticulous wisdom had crafted the best watch in the world and to look at the
[time=2446] quartz watch and say we need to go there was as if to say we are rejecting all of your energies and all of your labor of love and all that you have done. And the emotional
[time=2456] fogginess in their head prohibited them from seeing the greatest invention in the watch world in the last 200 years. So they elected not to go with the quartz movement watch.
[time=2467] They even in fact elected not to protect a patent on the quartz watch invention and
[time=2473] so they innocently displayed it at an international trade show in Casio came by and saw it for
[time=2480] what it was and the rest is history. Rolex no longer holds anywhere near 50% of the market
[time=2486] they fell from 85 to 35% of the market in a flash because they were unwilling to recognize
[time=2492] that times had changed. It's hard, it's traumatic, it's frightening but it's needed because we're
[time=2507] not making watches you guys. We carry the message of Jesus Christ and if any product deserves
[time=2529] a fair shot in the marketplace, if any message deserves to be heard in relevant terms where
[time=2535] the people listening it can receive the information being given, it's the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=2543] It's the saving message of Jesus Christ. And so it precipitates in us a willingness to
[time=2550] dream again, great dreams and pray again, great prayers. All driven and motivated not
[time=2559] from duty and obligation but from a consuming love for Jesus Christ which brings sacrificial
[time=2565] obedience. Can we fight through our insecurities and we fight through our fears and we fight through our longing for yesterday and we move on with passionate love for our Savior.
[time=2579] Now this morning I can only hope to give you a brief overview. I think it's important
[time=2585] that you know where we're going and so if you take your little booklet again and if
[time=2591] you'd open to page four and five, you'll find here and I'm so thankful for Tim Teder and for his giftedness at this kind of stuff to take thoughts that the elders and deacons and staff have been working on for years now, a couple years and put them into something that you can get an idea of in a glance. This really is vision 2002. You can see the
[time=2611] evangelize, the edification, the equipping and the exalting. I want to explain to you how this thing flows, how this thing works, what these little diagrams means so you can gain some type of a concept of where we're headed. Now listen to me, you know as well as I do that the professional football teams are heading to the field today as they always do on Sundays and you know that for the last five, six, seven days there has been brilliant
[time=2635] coaching staffs looking at the game plan. They're looking at the enemy and they're looking
[time=2642] at his strength and his weaknesses and they have to look afresh in anew this week because it's a different enemy than last week and then they look at their own strengths and their own resources and they say we can win this game, this particular game if we go at
[time=2657] it this way and here's our game plan and if we can all, they say to their players, if
[time=2664] we can all do our part in the game plan we can have victory together and I'd like you to think of this thing as our game plan and maybe this as our playbook that we can see
[time=2677] where, what is my part, how are we going to defeat the enemy, how do we look at our culture
[time=2683] and find the weaknesses for the gospel that Satan has opened up in his foolishness as he has ravished this culture. What opportunities exist for us in light of these problems today
[time=2695] and then we look at our church and say what are our strengths, who are our players and how can we enter into this situation in a strategic way to win the game. That's what
[time=2705] this is, that's what Vision 2002 is, it's our game plan to bring people to Christ and mature them and develop them. You'll see there's five steps, it goes around the horn there, the first three involved evangelism, let's talk about those. Number one, you'll notice the person there in white, represents the unbeliever, that's the unsaved person we want to reach,
[time=2726] the person in black represents a Christian, a person who loves Christ, one of you, one of me, one of us and you'll notice the imagery is they've just come across that little bridge, it's as if they've been in the church and they're willing to cross outside the boundaries of the church to get into relationship, an authentic relationship with an unbeliever.
[time=2745] You know what, we don't have any unbelievers in our church, only one percent of us said they were unsaved, which is good when you're a church but it's bad if you're going to win people for Christ, you're going to have to look somewhere else in the church. Last night Heidi and I were at LS Airs buying a gift for someone and there was this nice lady that was there, middle-aged, helping us doing a phenomenal job and as she got busy helping
[time=2768] us and was finally working with her computer and making phone calls and checking everything out, I had an opportunity just to observe her for a moment and it seemed to me she was lonely, it seemed to me she was a little hard and I noticed that there was no wedding ring,
[time=2783] there was a place where one had been in her skin but there wasn't one now and my mind was filled with the painful images of what it's like to be her age and to have been divorced
[time=2793] and they're not too distant past and the shattering of hopes and dreams and the tearing apart of family and her kids and who knows her grandkids and I thought to myself what is Christmas like for this woman? How does she cope with a destroyed home at Christmas time and Thanksgiving
[time=2808] and what is it like going home after working at LS Airs every day? And I noticed that she
[time=2815] had difficulty breathing and that her teeth had nicotine stains on them and I thought to myself what is it like for her to be so driven to a particular thing called nicotine
[time=2827] and the compulsion that that may represent in her life trying to fill the void and the emptiness of relationship with God and meaningful relationship with other Christians.
[time=2840] And my heart went out to her, hard and lonely and desperate and I noticed she was especially
[time=2846] attentive to the details of her job and it made me wonder if she wasn't so given to doing a good job because that's all she has in the world. All she has in the world is to be the
[time=2856] best checker she can be and so she throws herself at it and there's nothing wrong with working hard but folks when that's all you're living for. When that's it. So how are we going
[time=2872] to move this woman? How are we going to move this woman to a place that she acknowledges Christ as her living Lord and Savior and then to bring her into the church where she can
[time=2882] worship God and have the experience that you and I so often take for granted of just praising and for who he is because we know who made this and we know where we're headed and we know the end of the earth and we know eternity and we can come in here and just let it rip because we love him. How are we going to get her to that spot? And how are we next going to get her into the fellowship of redeemed people where she can begin to open her heart and trust again and let people care for her and minister her in a personal way? How are
[time=2909] we going to get that woman to the place that she knows her spiritual gifts? You know how empty it is when you don't know how God has designed you to do your purpose? Do His purpose in your generation? You don't know, you don't feel used of God? How are we going to move
[time=2924] her? What's our game plan? What starts there at step one with a relationship? Somebody from
[time=2930] our church, maybe it's you, maybe it's me. Somebody needs to build a relationship with
[time=2936] this woman. Now my wife offered. She said, "Lussell, I could build a relationship with her. I'll just come by lots of things right here." And pretty soon we'll just be best
[time=2948] a friend. Somebody from our church has to get next to this woman and the 300,000 other people
[time=2958] that live in Fort Wayne. And we've got to say to them without saying it to them that I care about you woman, I care about God's image that was, you are of value, you are of worth,
[time=2969] you are being ripped apart by a culture that is dominated by Satan, but despite it all, you have value. And I love you and I want you to know that. We've got to do that. And
[time=2981] we can't do that through advertising. We can't do that through newspaper articles. We have to do that in the flesh, in the person looking into their eyes and communicating to them
[time=2992] the love that God has put in our hearts for them. And when the timing is right and by the leading of the Holy Spirit, the second step as you see is we have to raise a testimony
[time=3003] to the difference that Christ has made in our life. We have to be able to say this is what God has done for me. This is who Jesus Christ is to me. Not all at once. Not cramming
[time=3014] it down their throat. We need training even to know how to do that in ways that are sensitive and God honoring in a relationship of integrity. But we've got to learn it. We've got to do
[time=3024] it. And then like most unsaved people when they hear the gospel maybe for the first time, they're not ready to jump in. They're not ready to go with both feet. And so step three, we want to provide an outreach service for you that could function every single week.
[time=3038] A living Christmas tree every single week that is designed with that woman in mind and with your unsaved friend in mind. A non-threatening environment where they can continue to investigate
[time=3049] the claims of Christ and the relevancy of God's truth for their life.
[time=3053] We're week after week after week whether we're speaking on marriage or speaking on finances or speaking on divorce or speaking on whatever it is that the God of this age is ravaging
[time=3064] our culture with and holding up a different way, holding up the truth in gentle but confrontive
[time=3070] ways that say there's another way to live and letting them hear it over time in a non-threatening
[time=3077] way in a service that's designed from stem to stern, from the music to the clothes, for the unbeliever, you and your unbelieving friend. And through the combined witness of
[time=3089] the love that you have in your heart for them and the way that you're willing to minister to them is only a Christian can minister to an unbeliever. And through the verbal witness that you give to them and through the extended exposure to the reality of God's Word and the message of Jesus Christ who we can win people to Christ. We can win hundreds of people
[time=3109] to Christ. We can win thousands of people to Christ. You can, this church can in our next
[time=3119] phase of ministry. And that's represented by that cross at the top of the icon. People
[time=3125] coming now, you see they come into the church there under evangelize in step three and you got white dots and black dots and that shows that that's an outreach service. Everybody's not saved there and it's not for believers to worship. It's for unbelievers. But they cross through the cross and they come into the edification arm of our ministry where we draw them into adult Bible fellowships and we let them see what a good social looks like and how much fun it really is to be saved. And we love them when they get sick and we
[time=3152] provide meals for them when they need help. We draw them into small groups. Groups of
[time=3158] six and ten and twelve where they can develop a level of intimacy that they may have never known in their entire life. People cheering them on. You can do it. You can grow. You can
[time=3168] overcome that. You can make it. God's Word is true. And we're four you a hundred percent
[time=3176] drawing these wonderful new baby little converts into the power of our ministry. The power
[time=3184] of you, the resource of ten years and longer of walking with Jesus Christ. The stories
[time=3190] you can tell and the testimonies you represent. We've got to get them face to face with you.
[time=3195] We've got to get them close to you. They've got to see your life. They've got to understand in those foundational years that they can live differently. Not just be forgiven for sins but they can live differently. And then step five training for service. This is the
[time=3210] equipping arm of our ministry. And I can't tell you how excited I am till we get to this part in our series. Man those life skills seminars and legacy one and legacy two and legacy three and raising up a whole group of small group leaders. There's so much equipping that we can do and we are so positioned to do it because we have so many godly people in our church. Matur godly people who can be equipped further for the cause of Christ.
[time=3232] So with this woman in mind she needs to learn not only what spiritual gifts are, she needs to know what hers are and she needs to know where she can use them in the body of Christ and go away on a Sunday or go away on a Wednesday night with tears in her eyes as she drives home say and I've never been used like this before in my life. I've never been a part of anything this exciting. I didn't know life could get this good. God loves me. He forgave
[time=3255] me and he gave me gifts that I can serve and I can make a difference in bringing somebody else to Christ. And then you see in the middle it says exalt. The sum total of all we do
[time=3268] everything we eat everything we breathe every move we make at work at church or at play it's
[time=3274] in the middle to represent all of our evangelistic efforts and all of our edification efforts and all of our equipping efforts including missions as it branches out of equipping the whole thing gets offered to God as this one wonderful sacrifice of praise as we come together
[time=3289] to celebrate what he's doing in our midst and that's where she learns to praise her God.
[time=3297] That's where she learns to bow down and give him homage. That's where she learns to love him even when he doesn't fix all the problems in her life. That's where she learns to reattach herself to him even though her husband's still divorced during her home is still shattered and Christmas is still one of the most difficult times of the year. That's where she reignites.
[time=3319] So that's our strategy. That's our game plan. We think we can do this. We think we can
[time=3326] do this. We think this can happen. We think this is feasible. We think this is reasonable.
[time=3331] We think this is God's will for our church. We think this is the place God's leading us to go. But I want to say something to you very honestly. We're not going to be talking
[time=3343] to you in the next nine weeks now because this one's almost over. About Blackhawk as a corporation,
[time=3351] we're not going to be talking about Blackhawk as ABFs or as small groups or as big worship services. I want the opportunity to talk to you about you from God's Word. What are you
[time=3364] willing to do in our church? What are you willing to let God do in your life? And you've
[time=3370] got to bring yourself because you know something, none of this matters at all unless we hold
[time=3376] it in our hearts. Unless it's something that you allow God to break your heart for and
[time=3383] you step up to the plate and you say, "Good night, count me in." That's what I want to live for. That's what I want to do in my church. That's how I want my church to happen. That's how I want my church to grow. That's how I want my church to be known. If it stays out
[time=3398] here at a distance and you're thinking about somebody else, or you're thinking about it
[time=3404] in terms of other people in the church, we'll never go where we need to go.
[time=3409] What we're excited about, what God is doing here at Blackhawk Baptist Church, and maybe
[time=3420] you don't have a church, maybe you've never really had a church because you've never accepted Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and you feel alienated from God and from the people of God. But you hear this message, you get excited about the possibilities. Let's take a moment and let me lead you in a prayer that would help you invite Jesus Christ into your heart to be your personal Lord and Savior. Let's pray together. Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3443] I know that I have alienated from you by my own sinfulness and stubbornness. I know that
[time=3449] I deserve hell and wrath, but instead through Christ, I can be forgiven and given eternal life.
[time=3454] Accept Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. Pray these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3460] Well, if you've made a decision to accept Christ as your Lord and Savior, write us and let us know the nature of your decision. To receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the Special Bible Hour
