[time=0] But we must never forget that our responsibility is to represent the interests of our sovereign
[time=10] to this city and to this nation and to this world.
[time=26] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=34] Thank you for joining us.
[time=35] A recent survey indicated it takes 100 Christians 12 months to win 1.7 people to the Lord.
[time=42] A 1980 Gallup poll indicated that of the 22 million evangelical Christians in the United
[time=48] States, only 7 percent had received training in evangelism and only 2 percent had ever
[time=54] led someone to the Lord.
[time=56] Is this really what the Lord had in mind for His Church?
[time=60] Is this the best we can do?
[time=62] What's wrong with the Evangelical Church in America that makes it so unsuccessful in winning people to Christ?
[time=68] Well, today Pastor Moore explains the most successful strategy for evangelism in use in America today.
[time=75] Stay with us and see if it wouldn't be something the Lord would have you be a part of.
[time=80] Let's join our service.
[time=86] He loves to hear the wind sing as it whistles through the pines on mountain peaks.
[time=101] And he loves to hear the raindrops as they splash to the ground in a magic melody.
[time=111] He smiles in sweet approval as the waves pass to the rocks in harmony.
[time=121] Creation joins in unity to sing to him majestic symphonies.
[time=130] But his favorite song of all is the song of the Redeem.
[time=140] When listeners now make me lift their voices loud and strong.
[time=150] When those perches by his love lift to him a song of love.
[time=160] There's nothing more he'd rather hear nor so pleasing to his ear as his favorite song
[time=168] of all.
[time=173] And he loves to hear the angels as they sing holy holy is the land.
[time=183] Heaven's clients in harmony lift up praises to the great I am.
[time=193] God he lifts his hands for silence when the week is saved by grace begins to sing.
[time=203] And a million angels listen as a newborn soul sings I have been redeemed.
[time=212] His favorite song of all is the song of the Redeem.
[time=222] When listeners now make me lift their voices loud and strong.
[time=233] When those perches by his love lift to him a song of love there's nothing more he'd rather
[time=244] hear nor so pleasing to his ear as his favorite song of all.
[time=253] It's not just melodies or harmonies to capture his attention it's not just gentle lines or
[time=261] praises it causes him to stop and listen but when any heart set free washed and bought
[time=268] by cavalry begins to sing.
[time=274] That's his favorite song of all is the song of the Redeem.
[time=284] When listeners now make me lift their voices loud and strong.
[time=291] When those perches by his love lift to him a song of love there's nothing more he'd
[time=305] rather hear nor so pleasing to his ear as his favorite song of all.
[time=317] Holy, Holy, Holy is the man.
[time=330] That's his favorite song of all is the song of the Redeem.
[time=344] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=558] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=831] Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy, Holy,
[time=881] Thank you, celebration.
[time=892] On June 27, 1958, when Cuba was in an upheaval as the Castro rebels were trying to fight
[time=899] against the Havana regime, on that particular day, a number of Americans who were living
[time=906] in Cuba working for an American-owned nickel mining operation were kidnapped by the Castro
[time=912] rebels.
[time=913] They were taken deep into the jungles of Cuba.
[time=917] Ambassador Park Wallen stationed in Cuba received one simple direct message from the
[time=923] State Department in Washington, D.C., and it read this way, "Go in and get them out."
[time=931] That was all it was said.
[time=932] No military aid, no military support, no special service, no secret service.
[time=936] Nothing, just you, go in and get them out.
[time=940] And Ambassador Park Wallen had the difficult and I'm sure terrifying decision to leave the safety of the embassy there and the staff he had hired and recruited and the family he had brought with him and head off into uncharted territory deep into the jungles of Cuba, which he eventually decided to do.
[time=956] In fact, the very next day, he embarked by himself, and I don't have time to tell you the account that I read, but it is hair raising and a number of different points in this encounter.
[time=965] He almost dies.
[time=967] He eventually ends up face to face with Raoul Castro and demands by the authority of the
[time=974] United States government the release of these twelve Americans.
[time=979] I guess to everyone's surprise that request or demand was granted and he came back twenty-one days later with all twelve hostages.
[time=988] Now I raised this this morning because I think it draws a perfect parallel to our responsibility to evangelism.
[time=994] If you come with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 5, I'd like to spend a moment, just a brief moment, looking at 2 Corinthians chapter 5 and understanding and maybe trying to gain
[time=1007] new insight into why the Lord has called us and named us and appointed us as His ambassadors
[time=1013] for Christ.
[time=1016] It's a wonderful chapter and I wish we had time to preach the whole thing, but let's just read verses 18, 19, and 20.
[time=1023] It says in 2 Corinthians 5, 18, "Now all things are from God who reconciled us to Himself
[time=1029] through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation, namely that God was in Christ
[time=1036] reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and He has committed to us the word of reconciliation.
[time=1045] Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were entreating through us we beg
[time=1051] you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God."
[time=1057] The word reconciliation shows up a few times there in those verses, it's a rich New Testament word and there's much theology compacted into that little word.
[time=1067] But basically it means a relationship which was once good and strong that has been torn apart and now alienation and enmity exists in that relationship.
[time=1078] Modulation is the process of putting that relationship back together and of course just hearing the description takes us back to the Garden of Eden and Adam and Eve in a perfect relationship with God and then sin entered into their relationship and it destroyed their relationship with God and wrath and enmity and death enters into the picture.
[time=1098] It is the ministry of reconciliation that puts people back into perfect fellowship with God and that is the ministry as it says in verse 18, the end of the verse that has been given to us, each and every one, did oh my, it's a past event, it's already occurred,
[time=1113] you and I have already received the ministry of reconciliation.
[time=1118] The end of verse 19, what does that consist of?
[time=1120] The word of reconciliation, opening our mouths and giving honest, sincere testimony to the
[time=1127] gospel and to the person of Jesus Christ and that makes us ambassadors.
[time=1133] The ambassador is one who goes to a foreign land and who in that foreign land represents
[time=1140] the interests of the sovereign who sent him and so it is with we who are believers.
[time=1148] We live here as strangers and aliens, America to us is a foreign land because our true citizenship
[time=1154] is in heaven and we are here for the explicit purpose of representing the interests of our
[time=1161] sovereign, God Himself in the people who live in this foreign land and the parallels are
[time=1170] so striking.
[time=1171] The church becomes our embassy and it is here that we find our friends and our fellowship and our family and our warmth and we have beautiful walls that accommodate our embassy activity and our worship and our expression of our love.
[time=1184] But God has sent us one simple little telegram if you will and it is Matthew 28 to go into
[time=1191] all the nations of the world starting with our own, to go in and get them out and we
[time=1197] like ambassador Wallen are forced with the difficult, trying decision to leave the comfort
[time=1204] of our embassy and our family and our friends and move off into someone else's territory.
[time=1213] Someone else's domain and get them out, bring people back into a restored relationship with
[time=1219] God.
[time=1220] In the next two weeks we want to talk about this phase of vision 2002 and how we would do that and it raises the question how in fact is the most effective way.
[time=1230] How is the church being used of God to win people to Christ in this day and age and as you know, while the message never changes and the gospel never changes, while it will
[time=1241] always be that people are sinners and saved by grace through the work of Jesus Christ,
[time=1248] which involves a personal relationship with God, this is not religion, this is a relationship, while that never changes, the methodology does change over time.
[time=1257] If you think even about that progression in our own United States of America where some years ago, 20, 30, really 40 years ago, tracks were a very viable avenue of evangelism.
[time=1269] People in our country had a basic knowledge of God and ascribed to the moral absolutes and had been involved in religion.
[time=1275] Most of us had and so to receive a tract which clearly presented the grace of God was an eye-opening
[time=1281] experience for many people in our country and it built upon their religious past and thousands of people were coming to Christ through tracks.
[time=1290] You and I would have to acknowledge that if our church started this week or next week or at the end of our series, a church-wide, city-wide, tract distribution ministry in
[time=1300] this city, it would not do well for the cause of Christ.
[time=1305] People have a completely different feeling about tracks and the people who give them tracks today than they did 30, 40 years ago.
[time=1311] And if the 2,000 of us became armed with tracks, I mean, pretty soon Blackhawk would be a bad name in the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=1319] People are reluctant to even receive tracks, they don't know if it's coming from someone with the Hare Krishna's or the Mormons or raising money for some political cause or
[time=1328] just some wacko out trying to get money.
[time=1330] They don't want the track on the street.
[time=1332] If they're forced to take it, they'll usually throw it away within 10 or 15 steps of having received it even if there isn't a trash can around.
[time=1340] And yet you and I, 10 of us, we could just randomly pick 10 of us, any 10 of us, not just elders, deacons, pastors, staff, just 10 of us could load our suitcases today with
[time=1350] Gospel tracks and go to the former Soviet Union, jump on any train or stand next to any line
[time=1356] and they are forever standing in line waiting for bread and shoes and clothing.
[time=1359] And we could begin to distribute our tracks and not even know their language and as long as the tracks were in their language, they would be received, we would be thanked and we could get to the end of the line or we could make it to the end of the car, the railroad car and turn around and there we would see everybody engrossed in what we had just handed them.
[time=1376] And we could go back down that little car and start handing out New Testaments and people would receive those and many of those would be read, cover to cover 10 times by the people in that particular family.
[time=1387] And nothing wrong with the methodology, still being used by God and I've heard recent reports however that even the susceptibility of the people in Russia is closing to tracks, that even that door is starting to close and new methodology will have to be employed to effectively communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1405] E.E. hit America like a two ton brick, not too many years ago, a guy down in Florida,
[time=1412] a guy named James Kennedy was struggling in his little church, didn't know how to win people to Christ, had a burden to win people to Christ, couldn't sleep at night because people weren't coming to Christ and so he started preaching to people, win people to Christ, win people to Christ and that people sat there and said we ought to but we don't know how and nobody did and he got frustrated and finally acknowledged that he didn't even know how to leave people to Christ himself.
[time=1431] So we went out for a couple of nights trying to win people to Christ and over time he finally figured out a way and he came up with these things we call the two diagnostic questions.
[time=1439] If you were to die today and stand before God and he would say to you why should I let you into heaven, what would you say and these questions have been used wonderfully because
[time=1450] they bring people to the crooks of the matter of salvation, the heart of the issue and they can then articulate their works response and then the Gospel which he also went on to develop being presented even by rote memory to make sure that each dimension of the truth was properly covered and then he even developed the closed part of the presentation so people were brought to a point of decision and then he started winning hundreds of people to Christ and then he thought well I'll teach this to my people so he brought them in on Saturdays and weeknights and he got them to memorize all the material and said now go have at it
[time=1484] and they didn't go have at it because evangelism is caught, not so much taught and until he finally himself took some people out to become trainers did it ten times in front of them they finally did it they started pushing him out of the way and saying I can do this now and the whole training philosophy finally did it did it exist in a form that was very effective and then suddenly churches from all over the United States of America began to hail down to Florida and ask James Kennedy exactly how does this work it was produced in curriculum and distributed all around America and thousands and thousands and thousands of people came to Christ completely different methodology completely different methodology same gospel people coming to Christ today EE does not work by and large across the United States of America because it's a different United States than it was twenty thirty years ago and when a stranger knocks on the average Americans door these days the door isn't opened
[time=1536] and then the diagnostic questions asked and then an invitation to come sit for a twenty or thirty minute presentation of the gospel the door knocks and the person on the inside looks through a peep hole and is thankful that they have about sixteen bolt locks running all the way down their door it's a different day gangs and rapists and serial murders and
[time=1556] and senseless crime has locked the people of America up behind closed and locked doors
[time=1562] and if they don't know you from some other context they don't want to have anything to do with you people get broken down the sides of roads and don't get help because too many
[time=1573] people who have helped have ended up dead and raped and robbed it's a different day however
[time=1579] we could go right now to the Philippines as I did not too many years ago a foreigner a person from the West with a couple of Filipinos knocking on doors where we had never met these
[time=1589] people they didn't know their church there was no prearranged invitation there was no appointment set just knocking on doors oftentimes those doors were cardboard doors because the people were living in boxes the invitations were granted and we saw five people come to
[time=1603] Christ that afternoon through E.E. tremendous method being used even this day in other nations
[time=1611] of the world it was it stopped being effective here a number of years ago and so we ask ourselves
[time=1618] God how are you doing it today if we want to be effective in evangelism I mean if we
[time=1624] as a church really want to continue to win people to Christ God show us and educate us
[time=1630] and make us supple and willing to change and willing to flex to move from tracks to evangelism
[time=1636] explosion to what and that's in fact what the elder board has been looking at for the last
[time=1642] couple of years and we've been reviewing things and there seems to be a movement of the spirit of God much like the one with E.E. that is beginning to kind of move through the United States of America and it's a in many ways it's a return to some old things and in some ways it's a movement
[time=1656] to some new things it's a it's a method that that seems to be blessed of God that people are coming to Christ through it's something we like to explore here in vision 2002 the man's name isn't
[time=1669] James Kennedy and he's not from Florida this time his name happens to be Bill Hybels and he's from
[time=1675] Chicago and they have built a church around winning people to Christ and they have been training
[time=1682] and equipping their people in the pew not just the pastor then the main thrust of this whole ministry is training the people in the pew to be effective in relational evangelism sharing a verbal witness
[time=1693] or a spoken witness of relationship with God and then inviting them to an outreach service that's specifically designed for the unbeliever to take another step in the direction of coming to Christ if you have your little vision 2002 booklet this morning let me ask you to open at the pages four and five again and we touched on this briefly last week this week I want to go a little deeper
[time=1714] into some of these concepts and then next week I will ask you on behalf of God to make a formal
[time=1721] commitment to be involved in this kind of ministry in your life pages four and five
[time=1727] you'll notice step one is to build a bridge of a relationship an authentic relationship with an
[time=1735] unbeliever and wild is true that right now in America people's front doors are closed to the gospel and if you show up and they don't know you they probably will not open their door to you and it will probably not be a good experience for them or for you while that may be true it is also equally true that the door of their heart through an authentic relationship with somebody they know in some other context
[time=1759] work recreation their neighborhood while the front door is closed the door of their heart for authentic relationship is standing wide open it just so happens that in the last 30 years as
[time=1770] the god of this age has wrecked havoc on the American culture and we have adjacent the moral
[time=1776] absolutes and relationships have gone down right in sync with the throwing out of God's
[time=1782] absolutes because they were always intended to build relationships and when you throw out his absolutes you don't just start sending an objective way you start violating each other and the relationships all across America are trashed and people are hurting and souls are
[time=1796] scarred and they are lonely and they are mistrusting and they are in desperate need of a cold cup of
[time=1802] water called your love your genuine interest and concern in their life and they will open the doors
[time=1811] of their heart so wide it will amaze you i had absolutely no experience with any of this
[time=1818] stuff and long before i heard about the stuff going on in chicago this is five six years ago back in california never being exposed to this kind of evangelism in fact i went over to china
[time=1828] and as some other countries there on an exploration trip the philippines was included in that because my responsibility at the master's college was to try to help a whole generation of students find
[time=1838] out that if they're going to be scientists or dentists or lawyers or attorneys or whatever they're going to be whatever they're going to do when they get out of college that that sphere of influence is their mission field for the cause of christ that's their unique opportunity to reach people for jesus christ that's their mission field whether it was here in the united states or over in the philippines or wherever they would go and and so i was going on these trips lining
[time=1861] up trips for the students to go and catch a catch a vision for missions and i came back from one of those and i had to face the horrible reality that as a seminary graduate six years on staff at grace community church five or four years on staff at at the master's college responsible for a school-wide missions program i had absolutely no regular involvement with unbelievers end of
[time=1882] sentence paragraph page i was so busy inside the embassy i was so busy with my christian schedule
[time=1891] and my christian discipleship and my christian worship and my christian bible study my christian prayer and my christian fellowship with my christian friends that i couldn't point to one person in
[time=1901] the last twelve years who had done anything with me who was an unbeliever other than shake his hand and say hi and buy thanks for whatever i just bought from you and something didn't sound right about that to me so how did i got down on our knees and buy our bed and we said oh god please we don't even
[time=1917] know how to do this we don't we don't see anybody else in our church doing this but this can't be right
[time=1924] please show us and i've told you about dug-and-melodies sadam and the malies before i'll just briefly
[time=1931] touch on the high points of dug-and-melonies relationship they were our next-door neighbors and the biggest trial the biggest struggle in my life this is the truth was slowing down enough in my yard work to start a conversation with this man that that was the power of the spirit of god
[time=1946] that took the whole thing the whole trinity had to do that so i could actually stop long enough to ask him about the football game that afternoon because i was so involved in the embassy and i viewed that so much a part of my spirituality that i could get a whole bunch of stuff done that working with an unbeliever outside my job description was like wasting time by god's grace we began to talk and talk a little bit more not to mention the fear
[time=1970] and the intimidation that i felt to the core of my being because i didn't know how to talk to unbelievers nobody ever taught me nobody ever showed me didn't know if i was going to blow it every single time i opened my mouth but somehow the relationship got going and we built
[time=1983] we built some stuff and then his wife began to notice Heidi and began to see the way we were raising our kids and was very impressed with that and would ask Heidi questions about why this and why that and then one day they surprised us and they asked us to go to a movie a war and miller
[time=1997] scheme movie they were into snow skiing we were into snow skiing war and miller is one of these fanatical type scheme movies we went to high school local high school and watched this and then the dinner and on the way home they said hey would you guys ever consider well let's say we go to mammoth for a couple days and go skiing together we've been to mammoth
[time=2013] mountain a hundred times we loved to ski there we knew our way there and our way back we knew all the runs there was a total comfort with mammoth it was just a total discomfort with them we'd never been on a trip with an unbeliever before we'd never been on a vacation and and if we were going to take time and money to go someplace for fun we had thousands of christ hundreds of christian friends and and family members we loved dearly all of whom we could rally around the event of snow skiing why would we ever do this almost out of guilt but i hope more than that
[time=2046] a sense that god was in this thing we said sure and then went home and shut the door and said oh my lands what did we just agree to you know what happened we went on that trip and it was kind of
[time=2057] a spring ski trip and so easter was in the air and at dinner that first night dug looks across the table and says rustle would you tell me the meaning of easter please and it turns out he had been raised by a Buddhist and had never once heard the meaning of easter and couldn't distinguish why christians were so excited about about a bunny and easter eggs he didn't he
[time=2078] didn't understand any of those differences he was completely in the dark tremendous opportunity
[time=2085] i got in and i got out of that conversation as fast as i could because i didn't know what i was doing didn't want to overload him answered his question and changed the subject but he brought it up later and then later and then later and then later and finally once sunday i'm in my church preaching and there come dug and mail through the back door they knew i was a preacher somewhere we'd never told them where they just followed us there one of the hardest decisions for leaving california believe this or not one of the hardest
[time=2114] i guess emotionally kind of the gut wrenching thing because those two years with them had been so rich and so full and we were seeing god move in their life was to leave them and come here
[time=2124] they were heavy on our hearts by god's grace my best buddy kelly bird and kebri were able to pick
[time=2130] up that relationship and we kind of transitioned them in there they switched over to a different church that kelly happens to go to they've been going to church every day every excuse me every week for three years they go every single sunday to this church they continue to hear the gospel
[time=2145] they haven't received the gospel yet they're not christians yet every time now that i go home to california for these trips that i'll go on occasionally to
[time=2154] check up with family and friends and all the rest there's always time in my schedule to see dug and mail and john and judy maly and they can't understand that either they know how many friends they know
[time=2166] how many opportunities they know how much stuff i should be doing when i'm there for that week but i'm always with them for a meal last time i was there we we played golf together brought my dad into the picture because i wanted him to see kind of a history of who we were
[time=2180] well the thing absolutely blew me away last winter i get a phone call and it's dug
[time=2188] and dug says hi russell it's dug i said dug how are you says great guess what the temperature is today in california i said dug i hate you what is this he says just guess i said uh okay
[time=2200] it's 82 he says wrong it's 80 degrees she's now guess what it was in palm springs today which is this beautiful desert community that we've talked about before i said uh 87 he says wrong it was 85
[time=2211] i said dug why are you doing this to me you're trying to hurt me what what he said russell mel and i have a condominium right there we got it reserved for such and such a week and we were
[time=2221] just wondering could you guys come just you and i just thought we could just have fun and if you can just get here we'll pay for all the food and all the condominium and all the golf we'll just pay for everything could you guys just come well i couldn't commit to him at that moment i
[time=2238] obviously expressed my thanks for his and at the end of the conversation i just i just said this i said duck more exciting than the possibility of getting out of an indiana winter for a few days and more exciting than seeing you is the fact that you were just thinking about us
[time=2254] and then this is a quote i'm not exaggerating verbatim it's indelibly carved in my mind he said russell we think about you and hidey every day
[time=2264] what because we went to a movie in a dinner and manneth and we hung around a little bit yes you
[time=2272] want to know why because we're the only christians in their life we're the only people where they can sense something inside of us the gift of god's love that is really for them and we want
[time=2282] nothing in return just to shower them with the love of god they don't know what to do with that they are sponges that want to soak all of that up that they can because the god of this age has ripped their lives apart divorces in the backgrounds and
[time=2298] parents and moms and dads that have fallen apart in confusion and they can see the world they can recognize what it is and never we didn't actually get to go on that particular trip but the next
[time=2308] time as i mentioned we did line up a golf game and my dad was there we had a tremendous day together and i'm still praying some of you are sitting here this morning say oh that's just great rus
[time=2320] but that's you and you have certain gifts and you have certain abilities and you're more charismatic than i am and i can't do that stuff man i want you to know so this is the most
[time=2330] exciting part some of us are extroverts and some of us are introverts and some of us like to do
[time=2337] athletic things outside and some of us like to read and think and have meaningful conversations and do other things indoors some of us like to play tennis some of us like to garden some of us come from really hard background some of us come from great background some of us are rich some of us are poor some of us are this and some you want to know why we're that way do you want to know why this great diversity exists inside the body of christ do you want to know why god made you just the way he made you because he needed an evangelist
[time=2368] that looks just like you because there are some people outside these doors that will never relate
[time=2375] to me and they will never connect with my style and and what i am as a human being but you know
[time=2381] something they'll connect with you like it was made in heaven i don't want you to become like me
[time=2389] that would be a tragedy i want you just to become more like you and then let god open up
[time=2396] the relationships in your life that are suited just for you because there are people out there
[time=2402] who will never hear the gospel as clearly from my lips as they will from your relationship with them so please don't misunderstand this this isn't a push to get everybody to the same way
[time=2414] this doesn't mean that everybody has to have the same gifts god has made each and every one of us
[time=2420] unique and part of the reason he has made us unique is because he needed just you to be the
[time=2427] evangelist to reach a certain number of people and only you can do it step two called a spoken
[time=2436] witness somewhere inside this relationship and it may not be as bold as my opportunity was about
[time=2442] Easter but somewhere in there you're going to have a number of opportunities to communicate your faith and maybe it'll be that your testimony or maybe it'll be the Romans road or maybe it'll be an EE presentation you'd memorize in the past and you're selecting from today maybe it's a book maybe it's a track maybe it's a tape maybe it's a combination of those things but it's not going to get done unless you open your mouth god has given you the ministry of reconciliation which is the word of reconciliation which is the message of Jesus Christ now one of the things that has been so liberating
[time=2471] for me which I learned later and I want to just I want to just wet your appetite okay this morning on this just very briefly there are some training tools out and we're going to start offering those as a church that are so insightful and so helpful in the process of friendship evangelism and how
[time=2488] to raise the testimony at the right time so that the fear and the anxiety level inside the Christian goes down and you feel more comfortable with that let me say it to this way you got to view evangelism
[time=2500] not as telling somebody about Jesus and success then is that they accept Christ like it's an event like it's this one-time event you saw on the screen today it was a 10-year process
[time=2511] between Craig and Wally that was a 10-year process you've got a snapshot of today and Wally was
[time=2517] moving through different stages of that as he moved through it now if you will take your bulletin
[time=2524] from this morning and open it up to the middle and you'll notice on the right bottom panel
[time=2530] there's a little box called living proof this is just an excerpt from this curriculum but it'll just wet your appetite man I just hope it excites you and you say good night there's this kind of help available minus 12 going his or her own way this is the progression of a person
[time=2547] moving towards Christ as they've studied it and looked at it minus 11 the person becomes aware
[time=2554] of a messenger has a positive attitude towards the messenger and is aware of a difference in the messenger think about Craig and Wally this morning up on the screen there was a point where Wally finally was aware of Craig that then because of the way Craig treated him and handed himself in
[time=2569] the music industry there was respect so there's a positive attitude towards Craig and then there was an awareness of a difference in Craig now these next steps minus eight to minus four are all to
[time=2580] do with the verbal witness or the spoken witness first aware of the bible's relevance to life
[time=2586] then he became aware of a positive attitude towards the bible because it made sense and it was right then he became aware of the basics of the gospel as Craig would share them then he began to understand
[time=2598] the meaning and the implications of the gospel to his life and then he began to have a positive attitude towards the gospel do you understand that's because somebody like Craig took the time to move
[time=2608] in the Wally's life where the questions could be answered and the testimony could be lived
[time=2614] and the little bits of truth could be communicated over time now steps minus three to minus one are out of our league friends this is all God there's nothing
[time=2624] we can do on this particular dimension recognize personal need do you remember Wally went through a divorce Wally's mother dies Wally has a son and says I don't know how to raise him the right way
[time=2635] God just takes that man and just ripens him or cultivates the soil that's always the work of God
[time=2645] minus two he decides to act he repents and believes new creature in Christ and now we've been working
[time=2652] with Wally for the last several years in discipleship trying to move him through these positive numbers let me give you this this is so exciting now do you realize that you can put any one of your unbelieving friends somewhere on this continuum which means if you can place them at one point you can know the next step and how to approach him in light of that next step in other words you've
[time=2673] got somebody at work but they don't really know you and they don't have a positive attitude towards you and they haven't ever seen a difference in you guess what that means take them to dinner go play sports with them read a good book together and discuss it invite them to see your garden whatever you have in common get yourself in that person's life and let them look and see the difference so they have a positive attitude toward you may already be at that point and it's time to help them move towards a positive attitude towards the Bible and they're starting to ask questions and maybe they need to tape on a particular subject or they need a little book on a particular subject or just a brief conversation maybe you're like I am with Doug and Melanie Sedam and they're already at negative four see if they have a positive attitude towards the gospel they've gone from minus 12 to minus four and they're stuck at minus four in my opinion they're stuck in God's opinion
[time=2721] I don't know what he thinks the point is this I can't do anything else right now except touch basement when I go home just continue to reinforce the foundation we've already built but I have to
[time=2733] feel relaxed and at peace just praying that God would open up their sense of personal need I can't
[time=2739] force that issue right now in business and their kids and every other dimension they are just having more success than they know what to do with they don't have any sense of personal need God may bring them to Christ through the blessings or he may begin to take some of those away
[time=2757] but I know it's out of my hands and I can rest in that I hope you see the power that this kind of
[time=2763] a tool would give you the understanding that it gives you it teaches you how to pray and it teaches you how to approach them and how to spend your efforts and when to step forward and when to back up and when to relax I'm telling you this is just one little itty bit of help that this kind of
[time=2779] curriculum offers you I hope you can recognize immediately that it would make a huge difference
[time=2786] in your sense of assurance as you work with people let me go to the third step relationships now third step outreach service
[time=2797] what we're saying here is that we believe there may be a need for two different kinds of services
[time=2804] one service is a worship service for believers for you and for me just like today where we
[time=2811] sing songs that are meaningful to us because we're born again where we where we are exhorted from God's word to live like Christians because we are Christians and we have the spirit of God within us and we need to be exhorted to live and to be challenged to live but you see a service like
[time=2827] this because of the way that our culture has drifted there are as we said 78 million unchurched
[time=2834] people in America they come into a worship service they didn't grow up with that they'd never really seen it before and they feel like they're strange and out of place it's like what am I doing here this is really weird I think it's foolish for us to assume that this generation is going to come in
[time=2850] here and connect with what we're trying to accomplish by way of worship so a second service is discussed
[time=2857] an outreach service that's designed not for the believer to worship but that is designed for the
[time=2863] unbeliever to take the next step towards Christ we create an environment where they can come in here
[time=2871] and see many of us because we're bringing them they are on our arm it is the relationship which
[time=2878] has been the invitation to come to this kind of a service and you have the confidence that the music that is selected and maybe the drama that would be used or the way the screen is used and the message that is brought isn't to a Christian to worship and to exhort to live like Christ says
[time=2893] it's to your unbelieving friend who can now take a non-threatening exposure to God's truth and
[time=2901] see the relevance of it in his life and I don't think it would be an evangelistic service every single time where you know every time you're saying you got to come to Christ it may be like the series we had on marriage for four weeks in a row we might talk about God's design for marriage and the unsaved people in the audience are going dude I'm a million miles away from that kind of experience but I like what he's saying and they come back next week and they say oh yes I understand
[time=2926] the Word of God it makes sense man you're right on the issues that I'm screwing up on in my life
[time=2932] and maybe then that last message of four might be the point where we say you know all that we've
[time=2939] talked about is impossible outside of a personal relationship with Christ because we're fundamentally selfish and marriage is all about giving to the other person and until we're forgiven and transformed by the power of the spirit of God there is no power to do this creative powerful dynamic ways of
[time=2957] bringing your unsaved person to a higher level of understanding of the gospel where they can investigate that in a non-threatening environment we don't know when to hold these when to hold the outreach services maybe Saturday night maybe Friday night maybe Wednesday night maybe Sunday morning one of them could come we don't know what we want to do is we want to experiment
[time=2976] with some options from January to June one and current we'll call them bring a friend Sundays
[time=2983] and we trust that as a result of these two messages on evangelism you'll begin to develop those relationships and you'll be knowing that we start with the living Christmas tree here in a little bit and then once a month in January and February and March and April May and June you'll have an opportunity to invite your unsaved friend to a service designed for them we can evaluate all
[time=3000] that and try to make some final decisions out there somewhere in June as to how it might or might not fit with our particular format oh I'm fast running out of time let me just close with this
[time=3013] some of you might be sitting here today thinking you know what Russell I'm not too big on what you're talking about here I mean what does this make the gospel relevant stuff I mean the gospel
[time=3023] is the gospel it's and we're not ashamed it's the power of God into salvation Roman 1 16 all you got to do is get it out it you're putting too much emphasis on how you get it out and we don't need to be changing anything and we like things the way they are let me just tell you a story about two guys the first guy's named Hudson Taylor and Hudson Taylor was a missionary from Europe
[time=3043] to China and in Hudson Taylor's day in order to bring somebody to Christ they had to do about four things they had to start dressing like you dressed they had to start eating like you eat talk like
[time=3055] you talk and then believe like you believe it's quite a long process and so as in Taylor went over there supported by his missions board and began to do traditional missions of the day and he found that there weren't any Chinese people who were interested in dressing like they did in Europe and eating like they did and talking like they did and as a result nobody was coming to Christ and he was utterly frustrated and he said this can't be the way this is supposed to work
[time=3082] and so he said I'll tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to start dressing like they dressed and so he had a ponytail because they did you know and he wore different kinds of clothing like they
[time=3091] did and he started eating raw fish and using you know chopsticks and rice and and then he
[time=3099] continued to learn their language not so he could make them learn his but just so he could become fluent in theirs and he became fluent in theirs and he slept like they slept and he lived like they lived and he only made one thing the issue coming to Jesus Christ you know what his mission board did
[time=3114] they fired him so that's not how we do missions you're changing things here see no more support
[time=3121] they cut his support off because he was changing things that were non-essential but he just stayed
[time=3130] at it he just stayed at it he found other support he suffered he was hungry he went without he stayed
[time=3136] at it and pretty soon thousands of Chinese people started coming to Christ because he got relevant he removed the extra biblical barriers to the cross and said there's
[time=3146] only one thing you need to consider to come to Christ not how you dress not how you eat not how you look not how you sleep not how you talk are you ready to accept Christ as your personal
[time=3155] Lord and Savior because you're a sinner and you need to come to Christ and we can trace almost every
[time=3161] Christian in China back to that original movement of the Spirit of God through Hudson Taylor
[time=3168] let me tell you about one other guy that made a big commitment to get the gospel relevant
[time=3175] his name is Jesus Christ you know he wasn't always in human flesh from eternity past he lived in perfect face-to-face fellowship with God the Father in spirit form
[time=3188] and then the fall occurred and then something needed to be done these people needed to get saved you know they could have decided to write it in the sky you could have awakened this morning and every Sunday morning at 8 a.m. there it is John 3 16 I mean that could have been the way they could have put it in like little birds and they could have landed on unsaved people's shoulders and whispered in their ear the gospel but for some reason the Trinity didn't buy that
[time=3213] they said no what they need is they need to be able to see God in human flesh
[time=3219] and so Jesus did something he he became man he took on the form of human flesh and I can hear
[time=3226] the people in heaven the angels up there in a hypothetical sense saying what do you mean you're gonna become flesh don't you know that all those humans are flesh and don't you know that every human being that's ever lived has been sinful and you're taking the form of a sinful thing
[time=3243] Jesus said no no you don't understand I'm not going to become sinful I'm just going to relate to them and if I have skin on they'll get the message a whole lot better and he didn't become this transcendent human being that just kind of lived in every generation he came to a particular generation in a particular period of time as a particular type of person a Jew who had a dad and a mom and and a and a vocation and then he got hungry like we get hungry and then he got he cried like we cried and he got pain like we got pain relationally and physically and so when we talk to people about God we can point them to the person of Jesus Christ that's a pretty significant commitment to get relevant isn't it what blows me up blows my mind about Christ
[time=3281] he's still he's still got flesh he'll always will have flesh he's somewhere right now in bodily form
[time=3288] the commitment to get relevant impacted the rest of eternity for him
[time=3300] seems to me that there's a lot of precedent in the heart of God for a church like ours that really does love God and really does believe the foundations of the gospel to say no what how tell me about this culture and without compromising biblical truth tell me how we can get relevant and what we're learning is it takes a personal relationship with you it takes a skilled presentation of the truth inside that and then for some reason God is
[time=3327] effectively using these outreach services where people can have a non-threatening exposure continued to exposure over a period of time one church we've heard about has made such a transition there are hundreds by the way they're
[time=3340] doing this all around America but one that we know about about our size has gone from almost
[time=3347] no evangelism whatsoever they and I kind of pulled this out of them they didn't want to offer this I said you guys want anybody but at Christ these days they said well we're averaging 25 people a month
[time=3358] 25 people a month we did some rough surveys on our church last year it was like 35 all year
[time=3366] that we know of we can do this we can do this we can see hundreds of people come into Christ every single year by God's grace
[time=3382] so
[time=3413] you reconciliation is a wonderful truth that the bible presents the possibility of having peace with God
[time=3421] having our sins dealt with and cast aside by the forgiveness of Christ and being in a loving relationship with God maybe as you look at your own heart this morning you sense that you're not
[time=3432] reconciled to God and you'd like to be reconciled to God I invite you to follow along in this prayer and that can be possible in your life Father I know that I am a sinner I know that I have
[time=3443] failed to keep your perfect law I know that I am at enmity with you that things are not right in
