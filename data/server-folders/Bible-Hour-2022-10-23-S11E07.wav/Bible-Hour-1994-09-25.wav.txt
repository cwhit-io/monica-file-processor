[time=0] But if on the other hand, as you've been listening to these last two messages, and as you hear this one this morning, if God is working in your heart and you really do feel a sense of conviction, a sense of desire, a longing to be more faithful in this particular aspect
[time=15] of your life, one you may have in days gone by, found great joy in, but have let go for one reason or another, then please participate, please participate.
[time=26] And so in light of all this, I thought this morning I might give you five reasons why you ought to make a commitment to personal evangelism.
[time=45] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=51] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=54] Thank you for joining us.
[time=56] It would seem to be a little question in the minds of most Christians that God has indeed called us to share our faith in Christ with unbelievers in the hope that they would be saved.
[time=65] Yet there's also a little question that the vast majority of Christians seldom, if ever,
[time=71] do it.
[time=72] Well, today Pastor Moore continues his series on evangelism by giving five compelling reasons
[time=78] why every Christian should be involved in personal evangelism.
[time=83] More special music today includes solos from John Gonzer and Marilyn Wong.
[time=91] Join our service.
[time=116] I will declare it to the nations. I will declare it to the nations. I'm not ashamed of the God's
[time=132] life. I will declare it to the nations. I will declare it to the nations.
[time=167] I will declare it to the nations.
[time=195] For the good news that Jesus has given you peace for my His spirit now all men can hear
[time=213] me pray. I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for He is a power of salvation.
[time=230] His Holy Spirit gives me love. I will declare it to the nations. I will declare it to the
[time=243] nations.
[time=244] Over and over, we'll tell of the story. I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed.
[time=259] Go tell the good news that Jesus is risen. I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed. I will
[time=268] declare it to the nations. I'm not ashamed. I'm not ashamed. I will declare it to the
[time=281] nations. I will declare it to the nations. I'm not ashamed.
[time=293] We'll return to the service in just a moment. You know, each week as you watch the Bible
[time=303] hour, you've probably noticed the beautiful open Bible stained glass window on the front of our church. It's a symbol of our constant desire to learn more from God's Word and apply it to our daily lives. And now the Bible hour is pleased to offer you this miniature replica of the Bible window on this attractive gold pin. It's our hope that it will serve as a reminder to you to pray for the Bible hour. We're sending this pin to all our viewers who write an enclosed, a suggested gift of $10. Write us today, won't you? Now, let's return to our service.
[time=352] There's a call going out across the land in every nation. A call to all who swear allegiance
[time=366] to the cross of Christ. A call to our true humility to live our lives responsibly, to
[time=379] keep in our devotion to the Cross at any cost. Let us all be sober, moving only in the spirit
[time=399] as daily ends and strangers in a hostile foreign land. The message we're proclaiming is repentance
[time=413] and forgiveness. The offer of salvation to a dying race of man. To love the Lord our God
[time=429] is the heartbeat of our mission, the spring from which our service overflows. Across the
[time=441] street or around the world the mission's still the same. We'll claim and live the truth in
[time=454] today. As a candle is consumed by the passions of the flame, still in light of the scary
[time=473] relief throughout a dark and new. Let us burn to know you deeper than our service flaming
[time=486] bright. We'll radiate his passions and blanks with holy light. To love the Lord our God is
[time=501] the heartbeat of our mission, the spring from which our service overflows. Across the street
[time=514] or around the world the mission's still the same. We'll claim and live the truth in Jesus'
[time=525] name. To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of our mission, the spring from which our service
[time=537] overflows. Across the street or around the world the mission's still the same. We'll claim the truth
[time=552] and live in Jesus' name. It's the heartbeat of our mission, the spring from which our service
[time=564] overflows. Across the street or around the world the mission's still the same. We'll claim the truth
[time=580] and live in Jesus' name. To love the Lord our God is the heartbeat of our mission. To love the Lord our
[time=598] God is the heartbeat of our mission.
[time=626] Well hello there my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour. I'm thankful that you're with us today. We trust that God will touch your heart in all that we're trying to accomplish in this particular program. We've focused this program on personal evangelism and
[time=640] our responsibility to pursue the lost with the gospel. It's both a responsibility and a privilege
[time=647] even as John has been singing about our mission. What a joy it is to know that we've been included and privileged to be a part of God reaching a lost and dying world. I know that brings a tremendous amount of purpose into my life and I trust that you'll gain a greater sense of how God would be using you for that same thing. Well we're excited to let you know that the cathedrals are coming to Blackhawk Baptist Church on October 8th. Trinity Communications is bringing
[time=672] them to town. You can buy tickets through your local Christian bookstore or through contacting Trinity Communications. October 8th and then they'll be with us for two concerts, three in the afternoon
[time=683] and seven o'clock in the afternoon or in the evening and I just encourage you to take advantage of this wonderful time of fellowship and praising God together. Well let's continue now with our program and our prayers that God will work powerfully in your heart through.
[time=707] [MUSIC]
[time=718] Millions still in every land, growing sins dark night, who will stretch our helping hand.
[time=737] Lead them to the light, who will tell them, who will tell them of the crucified, who will tell them,
[time=756] who will tell them for them he died. Millions still have not been told how the Savior came.
[time=778] They are yet outside the fold, lost in sin and shame, who will tell them, who will tell them
[time=795] of the crucified, who will tell them, who will tell them for them he died.
[time=822] Millions still have never heard that the Savior lives. They await the glorious word that new life he
[time=843] gives, who will tell them, who will tell them lost in dying men, who will tell them, who will tell them
[time=864] Christ lives again, who will tell them, who will tell them lost and dying men, who will tell them
[time=885] who will tell them Christ lives again.
[time=898] Well we're trusting, as you know, that the answer to Marilyn's question
[time=911] will be me, that you will step up to the plate and say, I will tell them.
[time=916] As you know, this is our second message on evangelism, and we're concerned about our
[time=926] church's commitment to evangelism, not because we're concerned about numbers and attendance and those kinds of external things, but because of a lot of internal things, what does it mean for a Christian to really be strong in growing in the Lord, and can strong maturing Christians exist without being vitally involved in the process of evangelism? What would that say about the health
[time=947] of a church? What about the honor and the glory that we want to offer to God because we're faithfully
[time=953] winning people to Christ? How is it that we would reach a stage in our church after 25 years that
[time=960] we had somehow lost the intensity for that particular aspect of ministry? And so last
[time=966] Sunday we talked about a strategy for evangelism, and we were asking ourselves the question, how does that get done in 1994 and 95 and 96, and you remember we talked about a model that seems
[time=976] to be prevailing all over the United States of America, effective in reaching this particular generation. One, by building strong relationships with unbelievers, two, by having that believer share
[time=988] a verbal or a spoken witness about the difference that Christ has made in their life, and then three, offering them an outreach service where the unbeliever can continue to investigate the relevancy of God's Word to their own life. And frankly, we could do some of those things.
[time=1005] We could give a cent to Vision 2002 as a church. We could even raise the money for our Vision 2002,
[time=1011] hire the staff, put the outreach services in place, but unless each one of us as individuals
[time=1017] makes a personal commitment to the process of evangelism, that whole process will fail.
[time=1024] It will be meaningless. The unsaved aren't going to come through our doors because we advertise there's a service that might relate to them. They're going to come through the door because you have built that relationship, and I have built that relationship, and we have given them invitation. And so it's fitting that this service be all about commitment. It's fitting that
[time=1044] we take yet another offering this morning, not of financial resources, but of a commitment of vow
[time=1050] that you are going to make or some of you will make to invite you the opportunity to make, I will offer this part of my life up to God this morning and be faithful to keep that commitment as faithful as I would a commitment to give to a building program. I'll just regularly make my installments
[time=1066] in this area as God would guide and direct and lead me. So I thought this morning I might
[time=1072] speak on five reasons. Five reasons why you ought to make this commitment. And I want to say again,
[time=1078] this is not intended to be a legalistic kind of a twisting your arm, brow beating kind of a
[time=1085] thing at all. You're going to make this commitment in the privacy of your own heart, and when the plate comes by you'll either drop something in there or you won't. There's no way for us to know those kinds of things. The names that we collect on the back of that card will never be read, it'll only be so we can mail them back to you. This is a personal thing between you and the Lord. And so I'm going to try to reason with you and help you think about your relationship with the Lord this morning and see if in fact this wouldn't be a commitment he want you to make.
[time=1110] So five reasons this morning why you ought to rededicate yourself or make a significant
[time=1117] commitment to personal evangelism. The first one if you'd come with me to Romans chapter 8.
[time=1121] Romans chapter 8, the first reason is this, it will make you more like Christ by making this
[time=1131] decision this morning, it will make you more like the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1135] Once a person comes to know the Lord there is the question where is this leading me,
[time=1141] where is this taking me, what is the goal, what is the objective inside this Christian life,
[time=1147] where am I headed? And the answer comes back, the whole thing is pointed for you to become like
[time=1153] Christ, to become Christ like. And that is a true statement that is good doctrine and it comes
[time=1159] out of this little verse in Romans 8, 29 where it says for whom he that's God for new he also
[time=1166] predestined to become conformed to the image of his son. What that verse is saying is that all
[time=1172] of salvation begins and exists for and culminates in this wonderful reality that we become like
[time=1178] Christ and thereby give glory to God. That's true, that's good theology. The process we're
[time=1185] involved in is to become more like Christ with the passing of each and every day, that's how we grow, that's what maturity looks like, that's the standard, that's the point of evaluation, that's the goal, that's the objective, become like Christ. The question is, what does
[time=1201] it mean to become like Christ? What does Christ's likeness look like? How do we define Christ's likeness?
[time=1210] Obviously it's not doing miracles, he hasn't given that ministry to us. Obviously it's not for us
[time=1216] to physically literally die on the cross for people's sins, he hasn't given that ministry to us.
[time=1220] So where does he stay unique and where do we imitate and become like Christ? You don't need
[time=1226] to turn there but there are a number of other passages where people frequently go, Philippians 2 for example says, have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus and so to become
[time=1236] Christ's likeness is to have the attitude of Christ and in that passage it means giving up your own rights and serving one another in humble service and personal sacrifice, that's part of it.
[time=1246] We could go to 2 Corinthians 10, 5 where it says taking every thought captive to the obedience of
[time=1252] Christ and part of what it means to become Christ like is to think like Christ would think and any
[time=1259] thoughts or attitudes or internal musings that are inconsistent with obedience to Christ we would
[time=1265] we would rule those out and say, no, I'm going to become like Christ. I'm going to bring every thought captive to Christ. One thing leads to another and the common definition of Christ's likeness, which tends to emerge inside of Christianity, is that it becomes synonymous with Godly character.
[time=1280] To become Christ's like is to have Godly character, the humility of Christ and the contentment of Christ and the joy of Christ and the holiness of Christ and the faithfulness of Christ and the patience of Christ and the gentleness of Christ. And for certain that would include part
[time=1298] of what it means to be like Christ. My concern is that all too often inside the church in America today, that is the sum total of what it means to be like Christ. I mean, that's it. That's the full definition. That's the full objective. That's what people are really after. Godly character makes me like Christ. That's my objective. That's my goal. However, when we do that,
[time=1320] when we let that become the sum total of Christ's likeness, we strip from the life of Christ the
[time=1327] real power and the real passion of His life. We strip from the whole definition the real essence
[time=1334] of Christ is all about. You realize that Christ did not come to planet earth so that He could kind of be the showpiece of Christian character. So there would be this great example of what Godliness
[time=1345] looks like in human flesh so we could imitate it. That is not the principle purpose for which Christ came. Luke 19 tells us why Christ came. It says, "He came to seek and to save the lost."
[time=1357] The central passion, the heartbeat, the burden, the charter statement of His entire life had to do
[time=1365] with seeking and saving that which was lost. And any definition of Christianity, any definition of Christ's likeness which does not have at the heart of it the whole notion of
[time=1378] seeking and saving that which is lost is stripping from Christ the central purpose of His life.
[time=1383] It doesn't make sense. It's illogical. It's like the little boy who wants to be like his dad,
[time=1392] and we've all seen that. Or the little girl that wants to be like her mom. And so the little boy
[time=1399] says to his daddy when he's old enough to talk, "Can I shave with you?" And so pop him up there on the sink and put the stuff and give him a toothbrush and let him go at it because he wants to do what dad's doing. If that's what I want to do what dad does. And then later in life he picks up some of the mannerisms and maybe eats the same way or talks the same way or holds his hands the same way or does a lot of things, wants to drive the same kind of car, all this lightness stuff. I mean, and the kid comes to 25 or 30 years of age and he's got a lot of the same mannerisms and people say you're just like your father. And that's true to an extent, isn't it? But man have you stripped
[time=1432] out the real meaning of what it would be like to be like your dad. It isn't until you hold his values and his priorities and you hold the passion of his life and it's in your heart and in your soul
[time=1444] that you've really become like your father. The fact that you can imitate some of the behavior and you've got some of the motions, that's really a subordinate thought in becoming like your father.
[time=1454] We do that with Christ. We do that with Christ's likeness. When we take out the notion that the
[time=1461] real passion and purpose and progression of life in my life is that I will grow in compassion for
[time=1468] the lost and be like Christ where when he saw the lost there was a gut wrenching churning inside of
[time=1474] him a physical disturbance that would go on when he saw their condition. And out of that
[time=1480] compassion and willingness to sacrifice his life for them, if we've got a definition short of that,
[time=1487] well then we would evaluate that in our own lives. Since you have come to Christ
[time=1493] and you have been on your path to Christ's likeness,
[time=1500] is it true to say that you are more burdened today, not a drummed up kind of thing, but just a genuine
[time=1506] spontaneous response to the desperate need of the unsaved that doesn't make you angry at them for
[time=1512] ruining your country, that doesn't make you angry with them for doing this, but there's just a deep seated compassion that's growing over time and you're finding over time in your quest of Christ's
[time=1522] likeness that you're willing to sacrifice more and more and take greater risks and be more vulnerable
[time=1528] to positively impact them for the or is it the opposite. I read an article today about this
[time=1535] out of Dallas Theological Seminary, one of their new journals since Chuck Swendall has come on board and the opening paragraph talks about a person who's basically saying when I first came to Christ, man I wanted everybody to know about Jesus and I told my friends and a couple of them got saved and it was just like the most important thing in all of life was that people would learn about the wonderful Savior that I had just met and then they went on to admit that over time that
[time=1557] burden and that passion began to dwindle and now they're wondering if they have any desire at all and if there's any real tangible evidence in their life that they are more concerned about the lost.
[time=1567] We've got an improper definition of Christ's likeness and it allows us to evaluate ourselves on the subordinate issues and miss the true passion
[time=1582] of his life. He said in John 17, 18, as thou, you're speaking in a prayer, he's saying as thou
[time=1588] God has sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world. We share his purpose.
[time=1594] I want to confess to you this morning that the first five, six, seven, eight years of my Christian
[time=1601] life I was caught in this kind of half definition of Christ's likeness and though I was moving through
[time=1609] seminary and I was on staff at a wonderful church and I was dedicating my life to the ministry and I was doing everything I could think of to do to be what Jesus wanted me to be because the definition of Christ's likeness somehow stopped that Christian character qualities and ministry inside the church and it was never strongly emphasized that to really become like Christ it would involve
[time=1627] a brokenness over other people's lostness and an increasing willingness to touch them with the gospel there was none of that kind of growth in my life and you may be in that same spot this morning
[time=1639] that may be exactly where you are and as you look back over the last several years you may have to
[time=1646] admit to yourself and confess this to God Lord it's been it's been an increasing indifference
[time=1652] to the real condition and I know that's true because I don't see any evidence of my effort to
[time=1659] win people to Christ in my life that's been going in a decreasing pattern I want to invite you to confess that this morning privately in your own heart
[time=1668] and I want to invite you to repent which means to turn from that behavior and start a different behavior which might include some commitments that are available to you on that card the second reason why I'd like you to consider making this commitment this morning
[time=1686] is because if you make it this commitment will make you unique among the people of God throughout
[time=1692] the history of the world this commitment will make you unique among the people of God throughout
[time=1698] the history of the world I wish I had a long time to try to explain all this to you but I want
[time=1704] you to know something from the moment the fall occurred God has been trying to find a way to
[time=1712] redeem people back into a loving relationship with himself it culminates obviously in the person of Jesus Christ but there are 2,000 years represented in the Old Testament
[time=1723] and it was plan A for God and he called Abraham to be a nation and he made a covenant relationship
[time=1731] with the nation of Israel which said if if you will obey me I will bless you circumstantially and you'll have more cows and more sheep and more corn and more wheat and more babies and
[time=1742] more prosperity than any other nation in the entire world but he was very clear to say to them that is not because I just want to bless you
[time=1752] it's because I want to use you as a missionary nation that I can lift up to all the other nations
[time=1759] who are seeking those same things more corn and more wheat and more cows and more sheep and more babies in that agrarian community and when they look at the way I will bless you they will have
[time=1770] no other conclusion that they could ever draw except that I am the true and living God and they can
[time=1776] forsake their false gods and worship me that was the whole purpose behind the nation of Israel
[time=1782] that's the heart of the covenant that God made with the people of Israel and I'm sorry to report to you that you can read in your Old Testament 2,000 years
[time=1791] where the people of Israel did not respond to that mission that God had for them
[time=1797] and so they are described as hard-hearted, stiff-necked, hard-of-hearing, rebellious people
[time=1803] who for 2,000 years spurned the purpose of God lived in disobedience and thereby he
[time=1810] could never bless them and they were never the witness to the nations of the world that he wanted them to be. 2,000 years think about it Sinai and Jericho and David's life and Daniel's life and
[time=1823] though there were key men there and key women of godliness there may have been a bright spot from time to time in this 2,000-year history the vast majority of time the people were utterly indifferent to the purpose of God in their nation and as a result the nations of the world did not hear the truth. You know what God did? God took the nation of Israel and said I'm done with you now
[time=1844] and put them on the shelf and that's where they are right now. He did that about 2,000 years ago
[time=1850] and he said instead I will now create a new people. They will be called the church,
[time=1856] the called-out assembly of God and I will hand to them this baton. I will give them this responsibility
[time=1865] as he did in Matthew 28 now to go into all the nations including our own city. He said in effect
[time=1871] for 2,000 years I found a people who didn't really care about my heart for the other nations of the
[time=1877] world and so they are now on the shelf and I will create this new thing called the church with Jew and Gentile empowered by the Spirit of God to reach the nations of the world.
[time=1887] If you'll open your Bibles now to 1 Peter chapter 2 I just want you to see that
[time=1893] kind of comes to a head and it's truth there. 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 9
[time=1900] 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 9 says speaking to the church but you are a chosen race,
[time=1912] a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession. Now in my Bible those
[time=1918] are in capital letters because whenever there's a quote from the Old Testament it comes up in all caps. Those are all titles that had been given to the nation of Israel.
[time=1928] Those are peculiar titles that have been given to the nation of Israel in the Old Testament
[time=1934] but he's now giving them to us, the church. We are now a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession and he's calling us what he used to call Israel
[time=1945] because we now have their responsibility on earth. As you can see in verse 9 that you may
[time=1951] proclaim the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
[time=1957] Do you get it? He has said for 2,000 years Israel wouldn't do it. Okay you guys are on the shelf.
[time=1964] Now I've got the church and so to help us understand this concept he calls us the names that he called
[time=1970] Israel and then gives us that purpose not only in Matthew 28 but right here again so that we might
[time=1976] proclaim the excellencies of him who called us. We've got it. We're it. We're his plan B
[time=1983] and we are the only plan. We are all he has to reach these people for Christ.
[time=1989] And I'm sorry to report this to you this morning but we, I don't mean just us, I mean the church in
[time=1997] America has proven almost as indifferent to his heart to reach the nations as the nation of Israel
[time=2004] did. We are on the borderline of being as hard-hearted and as negligent and as stiff-necked as they were.
[time=2011] In 1980 there was a Gallup poll taken of the 22 million evangelical church-going Christians of
[time=2019] America. I think we just lost our power or our air conditioning. Hope it doesn't get too hot in here.
[time=2028] 22 million evangelical church-going Christians evangelical just means they believe the gospel
[time=2038] like we do. The survey revealed that only 7% of them had received and taken evangelistic training.
[time=2048] The survey also indicated that only 2% had ever introduced another person to Jesus Christ.
[time=2058] That's not a good report. That's not a good statistic.
[time=2063] And we have an opportunity as a family of God here to stand up, to drive a stake in the ground
[time=2073] and say that's gone on long enough. And if God has been looking now for 4,000 years for a people who
[time=2081] will truly understand his heart that this Christianity stuff isn't just about us, it's about us reaching
[time=2087] them. Then by the grace of God he's found us here today. He has found us here today and we from this
[time=2096] day forward will train ourselves and equip ourselves and design the function of this church in a
[time=2103] strategic way that reaches these people for whom he has raised us up. Kind of like let the word go
[time=2111] forth from this day to friend and foe alike that a new thing has happened. And we're driving our
[time=2120] stake in the ground and we're going to go after it. Because we sense the frustration and the longing
[time=2126] and the hurt in God's heart after 2,000 years with Israel and another two with the church.
[time=2131] Now of course there have been wonderful bright spots in the last 2,000 years in the history of the church but in this unique place in the United States of America, this church of this particular
[time=2142] day has really shifted away from its mission. Let me give you a third reason.
[time=2152] The third reason I think you have to make this commitment today is because it will bring a whole
[time=2160] new level of purpose into your life. It will bring a whole new level of purpose into your life and I mean by that this. You and I were built for a whole lot more than living comfortable satisfied
[time=2172] Christian lives. We were built for a whole lot more than living in the right neighborhood that
[time=2178] that suits where we want to raise our kids. Then having the kind of job that pays us well and kind of stimulates our creative juices and gives us expression to who God has created us to be.
[time=2188] We were created for a whole lot more than helpful recreation that kind of sharpens the saw and
[time=2194] renews our spirit and gives us that necessary diversion. You understand when you're living for just those things, even if you're just living for those things plus Christian fellowship, we were created to be instruments in the hand of God to reach a lost and dying people.
[time=2210] And when you take that part of his purpose out of your life there is an inescapable
[time=2217] emptiness. There's a hollowness in life that can never be filled.
[time=2223] When you cut his purpose for you in the unsaved person's life out of your life you leave a hole
[time=2232] that you will spend the rest of your life trying to fill.
[time=2234] I'm really excited about a friend of mine here in Indiana who's kind of put his arm around my
[time=2242] shoulder and is introducing me to one of the new things that you get to do because you live in Indiana and that's to bow hunt, you know, hunt deer with a bow and arrow which I've never
[time=2253] really heard of before. I moved to Indiana when I first moved here I thought it was kind of stupid and I'll just be honest I had no one to... Well this guy man about three weeks ago puts his arm around and says, "Have you ever gone deer hunting with a bow?" and I said, "No." And he says, "Let me get you going on this. I think you're going to like this." And you know what? I'm addicted.
[time=2267] I haven't even gone hunting yet but I'm addicted already because he's helped me get a bow and it's all this new language and terminology and technology and these arrows and then we go down to these certain places where you shoot on the range and I'm just loving it. I'm just absolutely enjoying it beyond my wildest dreams. I have no idea and it's just wonderful diversion. It's a wonderful thing to be distracted by and come back fresh into the office or the ministry or the home or where.
[time=2292] You know, we all need those kinds of things. And I love talking to people about it. I love telling them my little stories about what I learned and how it's going and what's going to happen and so this Saturday I get to go for the very first time. It's when the season opens.
[time=2305] But I was talking to my wife about this as I was thinking about this message and I'm going, "You know, here I am again. Here I am again. I'm forgetting that I'm really in the people business.
[time=2316] I'm forgetting that Christianity is really about loving people. It's not about things and toys and
[time=2322] as nice as the distraction is." And I'm thinking, "Honey, how come I'm not more excited about the
[time=2329] unsaved guys that I'm meeting now that I've gotten into this new arena called bow hunting?"
[time=2335] And I've met some really neat guys that are unsaved, spending some time with them.
[time=2339] But I'm having to confess, you know, I'm more excited about what it feels like to do this thing than I am the possibility of touching these people's lives for eternity.
[time=2348] It's just a process of continually reevaluating that kind of stuff in our lives.
[time=2355] Do you realize if I stay at that more common level of being most excited about the hunt itself that
[time=2361] you know what? I might get to be pretty good with that bow and arrow and I might sit up there in that tree stand and freeze to death and eventually get one of these deers, you know? And I might even get a big one and I might even stuff it and put it on my wall. But you know what? That'll be the sum total of what that was about. I'll be able to come home and say, "Boy, I had a great time. Look at what I got. That'll be it." But if I just remember how God has built me and built you that He's
[time=2389] really put us into the people business. And if over this season and next season and the other
[time=2397] season, if I can make some inroads into some people's lives and they sense I'm kind of more excited about them that I am the hunt and I can make some extra deposits in their life outside of
[time=2408] those experiences. And if by God's grace, just one of them comes to Christ. Do you know what we're dealing with here? Eternity. I can come home and say, "Guess what happened today?" Somebody got
[time=2421] transferred from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light. Somebody's now going to spend eternity with God instead of eternity in hell. You see, there's the kind of stuff God made us for. And as I say it, it resonates in your heart. I know it does. And we all know that's really what
[time=2437] it's about. But we are so prone to lower our sights and go after just this other stuff as nice as it
[time=2444] may be. You know, there's nothing wrong with a diversion. There's nothing wrong with a recreation. There's nothing wrong with living in a nice neighborhood. There's nothing wrong with having a challenging job. Those are all gifts of God. But if we could just continue to remember
[time=2458] we're in the people business and that there's people in those neighborhoods and people in those places of employment and people in those places of recreation that desperately need Christ.
[time=2468] I believe we'll be satisfied to a level in our relationship with God that we will not otherwise
[time=2474] know. Let me give you a fourth reason today. Well, I think you ought to recommit the personal of
[time=2482] angelism. You will honor the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life in a new way.
[time=2492] Well, let me explain this to you. What are you expecting the Holy Spirit to do in your life this
[time=2499] week, this month, this year? What do you count on the Holy Spirit doing for you or doing in your
[time=2505] life, in your Christian experience? Maybe you count on Him to give you comfort, John 14.
[time=2511] Maybe you count on Him to teach you, John 14. Maybe you count on Him to convict you of your personal sin, John 16. Maybe you count on Him to guide you through the deep waters of life, Romans 8. Maybe you count on Him to intercede for you when you are wanting to pray but don't have words for it because it's too deep. The groanings are too deep for words. Romans 8.
[time=2532] Maybe you're counting on Him to empower your giftedness to minister to the body of Jesus Christ, 1 Corinthians 12. Maybe you're counting on Him to fill you to be under His control and that He
[time=2544] can lead you through the everyday issues of life, Ephesians 5. Maybe produce His fruit in you, Galatians 6. Maybe be involved in the whole sanctification process. See, all those are specific ministries of
[time=2556] the Holy Spirit. But none of those are the charter reason why the Holy Spirit is on the planet today
[time=2564] in your heart. Let me invite you to come to Acts chapter 1 verse 8 for a minute.
[time=2569] All of those are legitimate expectations of the Holy Spirit and He will do those things
[time=2576] because He is faithful and because He loves you and because He wants to mature you.
[time=2580] But let me show you why the Holy Spirit has come. Let me show you the real charter statement of the
[time=2588] Holy Spirit's ministry on planet Earth. The one overarching purpose behind the whole thing with
[time=2595] respect to the Holy Spirit. Acts 1, 8, Jesus is speaking and He says, "But you shall receive power
[time=2602] when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be my what?" My witnesses, both in Jerusalem
[time=2611] and all Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest part of the earth. He relates to the church,
[time=2618] He exists for the church, He exists in your life ultimately to make you a powerful witness of the
[time=2625] person of Jesus Christ. The Holy Spirit never exalts Himself, He always exalts Christ. And when He is
[time=2631] in you, it is the process of exalting Christ through the way He comforts you and through the way He guides you and convicts you of sin and their seeds and gifts and empowers and fills and sanctifies.
[time=2642] But those are the means to the greater end of empowering you to witness for Christ.
[time=2648] But man are we prone to forget that part of it. We say, "Man, God's it worked in my life. Why?"
[time=2656] Well, because I got the right classes when I registered for college and I just consents Him putting that schedule together. Man, my mate is really turning around. God's at work. You can't
[time=2667] believe what's happening in my job. I got this huge contract we just had to have and I could just sense the power of the Holy Spirit drawing these factors together. He's at work in my life.
[time=2676] The kids are really starting to grow and understand the things of God. We sold our house just in the
[time=2682] nick of time and we're able to buy another one and I can just see God's hand in the whole thing.
[time=2686] What a tremendous vacation we had. We were traveling, we broke down, we were on this desert road and
[time=2692] we had a flat tire and wouldn't you know God provided and brought along a family to help us change the tire in this family was even believers. Oh, praise God.
[time=2701] Man, we have a way, don't we? I've turned this whole thing on us. I've turned this whole thing
[time=2709] on what we're going to get out of this whole process. How about, oh my goodness, God is being
[time=2715] so faithful because He's empowering me to be a faithful witness of the glory of God in people's
[time=2721] lives and things are really hard for us right now and circumstances are dismal and we don't
[time=2727] have enough money and this isn't happening right and this isn't happening but I can see the Holy Spirit working in and through that because we've had contact with some unique people that need Jesus Christ. You see, He doesn't exist to make you a happy, complete little Christianette.
[time=2746] He exists to make you a powerful, dynamic, undeniable witness to the power and the person of Jesus Christ
[time=2754] and when you realign your priorities with the priorities of God, when you commit this morning,
[time=2761] if you choose to do that and say, "No, count me in man. I want to do this witness thing thing.
[time=2766] I'm scared. I need training. I don't know how it's going to go. I'm as nervous as the next guy but I'm hearing what you're saying. I'm in on this." Do you realize you line yourself up in perfect
[time=2776] harmony with the very charter statement of the Holy Spirit as He is on this earth?
[time=2781] If you get in line and say, "I want to go where you said you were going,"
[time=2787] make me a powerful witness for Christ. Maybe it'll be here in Jerusalem, Fort Wayne. Maybe it'll be
[time=2795] in the tri-state area, Judea and Samaria. Maybe it'll be in Africa. We'll worry about that later.
[time=2800] But Lord, please, I want to be online with the Holy Spirit.
[time=2805] Let me give you one last reason this morning. Reason number five, and this is never really popular in
[time=2814] our day. And I don't want to say it with a harshness, but I think you ought to sign up for this today
[time=2820] from your heart because God is commanding you to, not me. Do you realize what He's saying in His
[time=2827] Word when He says that He's commissioned us to go throughout the day of our life, seeking to
[time=2834] baptize people and disciple them? Do you realize that is a command that's in the imperative mode?
[time=2840] In the day it was the mode when a general in an army would issue a command that's the imperative?
[time=2846] That's how those commands are being issued to us. There's a sense in which we are the soldiers of God and there is a military mandate from the high command that each and every one of us be pursuing evangelism in our lives. It's not really a matter of being gifted, and I know a lot of us
[time=2865] are struggling with that. A lot of us are thinking, "You know what? I don't want to do evangelism.
[time=2869] I mean, I want it to get done, but I don't want to do it. And I don't want to do it because I don't think it's my gift. I don't think the Holy Spirit gave me those gifts. See, I really like teaching the kids and I really like doing the sound and I really like doing this. And see, that's obvious.
[time=2882] That's my gift. And so I'll just do my gift and let the other people with the evangelism gift, they can do the evangelism. Okay? Can we just do it that way? You know what? There's a problem
[time=2892] with that whole line of reasoning. First of all, God has given the ministry of reconciliation to every believer. We've all been commanded to participate in this. Secondly, when you read
[time=2905] through the New Testament and you want to read the gifts that God has given, you never read the gift
[time=2911] of evangelism. It's not there. It's not in the lists. Now that isn't to say that there might not be
[time=2919] a gift of evangelism, but we can't find it anywhere in the New Testament. It doesn't show up.
[time=2925] As a matter of fact, if you'll think a little bit more deeply about gifts, you'll realize that
[time=2931] gifts are given to believers for who? Other believers. God gifts the church with spiritual gifts so that
[time=2939] the believer can edify the other believer. It's an in the embassy issue. It's how we build each other
[time=2945] up. Gifts are never spoken of in terms of reaching the unsafe. Isn't that amazing?
[time=2953] Isn't that just wipe your comfort zone right out this morning? I mean, isn't that just one of the most unfortunate truths you've ever heard? There's just really no way around this.
[time=2964] Now that doesn't mean you're going to be the greatest evangelist the world has ever seen.
[time=2969] Now if you have the greatest success, it doesn't mean you'll have a tremendous sense of longing to do it. But there are some things, aren't there, that we just do in our Christian life because we're soldiers and we've been indebted to him by his grace and he says, "March," and we go, "You got it."
[time=2982] And I think, as I've already noted, that when we march in that direction, it fills our heart and our life with more purpose than we ever dreamed. Listen, if you've been wondering, "Am I gifted?" And should I evangelize if I'm gifted, the answer is no, don't even think about it.
[time=2996] God's come in at each and every one, and gifts never talk about reaching the unsafe. They always talk about building up the body. So you're free to mark that thing today, even if you don't think
[time=3008] you have the gift of evangelism. So let me just review these, okay? And then I'm going to have a
[time=3016] word of prayer and then we're going to take a moment for you to fill those cards out.
[time=3020] Five reasons why I think you ought to do this. Five reasons why I did this, the first service,
[time=3026] you can see these cards up here from the first service. Hundreds and hundreds of names are represented there. One, it will make you more like Christ. It'll return you back to the passion
[time=3038] of the life of Christ who came to seek and save the lost. Number two, it will make you unique
[time=3044] among the people of God throughout history. You drive this stake in the ground, my friend, you will be unique and you will delight the heart of God.
[time=3052] Number three, it will bring a whole new level of purpose and meaning into your life.
[time=3059] There's a part of you that will not be satisfied short of moving with purpose into unsafe people's lives. Number four, it will honor the ministry of the Holy Spirit in your life. It'll put you
[time=3070] right online with him. You'll be doing the same thing he's trying to do, empower you to be an
[time=3076] effective witness. And fifth, do it because God's asking you to do it. God is asking you to do it.
[time=3085] God is saying please, please be available, be intentional, be trained, be faithful, be sacrificial
[time=3094] in winning people to Christ. Let's pray together.
[time=3100] Father, this is just wonderful to be able to think about you in these terms, to be able to talk about
[time=3114] you in this way, to be able to have a service like this one where there's really a practical
[time=3120] thing that we get to do at the end of it that leads us to other practical things.
[time=3125] Lord, for those in our midst today who are not ready for this commitment, please give them the courage to at least admit that to you, but don't let them feel pressured by this.
[time=3134] Please don't. That's not what this is about. For those who feel it's stirring in their hearts,
[time=3141] for those who are sensing your hand upon them saying, you know what, this really is an area I want, I want to have involvement with you on. This is really a part of your life I want to get going in again. Man, let those people respond from true and pure hearts. And as we take a moment now,
[time=3160] Lord, to reflect on what these cards are saying to us and giving us opportunity to do,
[time=3166] may you be with us. In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3173] Winning people to Christ, needless to say, is a very, very important thing to the heart of God.
[time=3187] And we know it was the passion and the mission and the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. He, in fact,
[time=3193] came to seek and say those who are lost. And maybe you're viewing the Bible hour today as a believer
[time=3199] and you have another church that you attend, but you like to view the Bible hour and maybe God has spoken to you on this issue in your own heart. Maybe it's true of you as well that you've
[time=3210] allowed the whole effort of winning people to Christ to slip back to a lower priority in your
[time=3216] life than you're comfortable with and that you think would satisfy the Lord. And you'd like to take some practical steps to remedy that. Now, we're going to take some of those in our church, Lord willing, going to give some training and equipping and try to reinforce the whole concept.
[time=3230] But my heart is burdened for those of you who are watching today that want to make a difference for the cause of Christ and evangelism and would be asking the question, what do I do next? I mean,
[time=3241] how do I remedy this in my own life? Let me give you two very practical suggestions. The first is very easy and takes very little time. The second is a little more involved. The first
[time=3253] suggestion I want to give you is for you to take time to write out your personal testimony.
[time=3258] Many of us have the elements of it rumbling around in our head, but we've never taken the time to
[time=3264] give a condensed version of it that we could share with an unbeliever where God to open the door.
[time=3269] It's very simple to do. There are three parts basically to your testimony. The first is your life before you knew Christ. The second part is the actual moment of coming to Christ when you prayed to receive Him as your Lord and Savior and the events that immediately were connected with that decision. And then the difference that it's made in your life since you've come to Christ, three very simple parts. You might want to sit down and write that out. And I would encourage you not to take more than three or four minutes to be able to repeat it back. It shouldn't be a five or ten minute testimony. It needs to be three or four minutes because most of your unsafe friends may not want to hear it longer than three or four minutes.
[time=3307] And you can get the important parts across in that amount of time.
[time=3310] Be sure to share with them that you have a personal relationship with Christ,
[time=3317] that that is what has made the difference in your life. That it's not religion, it's not works, it's not trying to keep up a ledger of good deeds that will outbalance the
[time=3326] bad deeds that you're saved simply by grace. But tell that little story in your own way as God brought you to Himself. And be sure to add, at the end of your personal testimony, a sentence to the effect that this whole thing has really made a difference in my life. And if
[time=3341] you'd be interested to know how it can make a difference in your life, I'd be happy to share that with you. I don't think you need to ask that person to come to Christ at that moment, but certainly leave the door open for them to follow up with questions that they might be interested in. The second suggestion I want to make, which really does take quite a little bit of time and effort, but I think it would be well worth your time, is to purchase the curriculum
[time=3365] living proof. I think you can buy it through your local Christian bookstore. Living proof is the name of this curriculum. It's a 12-week curriculum designed to help you learn how to do personal
[time=3378] evangelism. And it is, without question, the strongest curriculum I have ever seen, because it's practical and it's relevant. It's supported by video, so you can not only study a
[time=3389] little book, but also see it in action through the videos that they've prepared. I encourage you to
[time=3395] grab a number of other Christians, maybe three or four, form a little small group out of your church, meet for 12 weeks in a row, and covenant together, not only to learn this material, but to apply it to your lives. As I say, this is a much heftier commitment, but one, I think, which would yield significant results. Well, for those of you who may be watching the Bible Hour today,
[time=3416] who have never made a commitment to Christ, who have never prayed to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, would like to do that. You're seeing that you could be a part of satisfying the heart of God by becoming saved, and you know you need to do that. I want to invite you to pray this simple prayer with me at this time. Father, I know that I am a sinner, I know that I have violated your holy law, I know that I stand in opposition to you, but through the grace that
[time=3442] you provide in the person of Jesus Christ, I accept him as my Savior, ask Jesus to come into my heart,
[time=3448] to wash and cleanse me of my sins, and I thank you for the eternal life and forgiveness that I can
[time=3454] have in Christ. Amen. Well, if you prayed that prayer, we want to encourage you to write us and
[time=3461] let us know the nature of your decision. God bless you. To receive a copy of Lessons on
