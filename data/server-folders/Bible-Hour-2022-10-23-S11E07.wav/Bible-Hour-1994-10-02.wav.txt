[time=0] The Christian experience and growth in the Christian experience and maturity in the Christian experience and moving from the point that you are to the point that you want to be is not a solo sport.

[time=288] Hi, I'm Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour and let you know how thankful we are you have tuned in today.
[time=294] Our message today as we're working through the vision for our church, Black Hawk Baptist Church brings us to the topic of small groups
[time=302] and the whole concept of edification and how effectively to build up one another in the body of Christ,
[time=308] how to be involved in meaningful relationships, how to let your guard down and let people into your life at a significant level
[time=315] where you can find the strength and the encouragement and the help and the wisdom and the support to continue to live a godly life for the glory of God.
[time=323] We trust that you'll enjoy that message that will be meaningful to your heart and you'll consider how you might find that kind of small group ministry in your own personal life.
[time=333] Along those lines, we're excited to let you know that promise keepers, as you know that's a great movement that's sweeping all over the United States of America
[time=340] with literally hundreds of thousands of men dedicating their lives to be promise keepers full of integrity in faith and love towards our Jesus Christ.
[time=351] They're coming to town to Fort Wayne on October 28 and 29. That's a Friday night and Saturday for a conference.
[time=359] They're calling it the Promise Keepers Leadership Conference and we have the privilege of hosting it here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=366] We're expecting men from the tri-state area, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan. We're expecting also a crowd of nearly 2,000 guys.
[time=374] One of the main thrusts inside the Promise Keepers ministry is a small group men's ministry.
[time=380] And if you have a desire to be involved in a small group ministry for men or if you have a husband who you'd like to see involved in this or you're a mother or a father who has a grown adult son that you think is in need of this kind of ministry,
[time=397] we want to recommend the Promise Keepers Leadership Conference October 28 and 29.
[time=403] You'll find as those who have come and left that conference there will be a tremendous emphasis and all kinds of encouragement and motivation and how to's to be involved in a small group ministry for men.
[time=416] So we encourage you to call the number that's been on the screen and register yourself or register someone you care about to attend this Friday night and all day Saturday conference.
[time=425] Also, we want you to know a little bit about our special gift offer this month from the Bible Hour. It's a book entitled "Fun is Contagious" by Chuck Swindall and who would know better than fun being contagious than Chuck Swindall.
[time=438] Many of us listen to him on the radio every day and find the enthusiasm and the joy that fills his heart and life.
[time=444] And he's written a book on how to bring fun back to the family. It's very practical and we want to encourage you to write us and request that we'd love to send it to you free of charge just as part of our ministry.
[time=454] Just as part of our ministry here at the Bible Hour to you and to yours.
[time=459] Well, we trust that as you continue to pursue the things of God, he is proving himself faithful.
[time=465] We're always hoping that you'll spend daily time in God's Word. There's no substitute for that.
[time=470] Though I'm sure listening to various different preachers on the airwaves, be sure to be in the Word on your own.
[time=476] And I'm confident that you're finding your prayer life full and vibrant as you're seeking the power of God through prayer.
[time=482] Well, God bless you and now we'll return back to the regularly scheduled portion of our service.
[time=512] We'll be faithful to complete it.
[time=523] He was told that the work will be faithful to complete it in you.
[time=535] If the struggle facing is slowly replacing your hope with despair,
[time=545] or the process is long and you're losing your song in the night,
[time=555] you can be sure that the Lord will take care of you, safe and secure.
[time=562] He will never abandon you. You are His treasure and He finds His pleasure in you.
[time=574] He who began a good work in you.
[time=583] He who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it.
[time=595] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[time=600] He was told that the work will be faithful to complete it in you.
[time=610] He who began a good work in you.
[time=620] He who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it.
[time=632] He'll be faithful to complete it.
[time=637] He who started the work will be faithful to complete it in you.
[time=665] Your wife has six months to live at best.
[time=668] The doctor's words tore open my heart.
[time=670] How could this be true? It just couldn't be true.
[time=673] But in fact, cancer took her life just three months later, 14 days before our 19th wedding anniversary.
[time=679] But you know the Lord and His infinite wisdom knew all that was headed our way, and He brought us into this church just two years earlier.
[time=687] He knew our family was going to need special people, and He provided so many.
[time=693] I never will forget the night that we rushed Sherry into the hospital.
[time=696] I called my sister in California.
[time=698] I was sobbing on the phone, and she asked, "Do you have anybody that come to be with you there at the hospital?" Well, the person I could think of was Larry, but it was midnight.
[time=708] How could I call him? He was a new friend.
[time=710] But you know when I did, he was there in an instant, and he stayed all through the night while more and more tests were done.
[time=716] And soon Pastor Russ showed up about one o'clock in the morning, and once things were settled a bit, the three of us went out together and had some coffee to talk.
[time=724] I'll never forget how much that meant to me.
[time=727] God provided me with something more precious than gold when He brought the Black Hawk family into our life.
[time=733] I remember my first visit here being greeted by a warm smile and a real firm handshake, but you know what really struck me was to see so many husbands and wives walking hand in hand into the church and seeing families sitting together.
[time=748] Those things really made an impression on me, and I said to myself, "This is a special place where people really care for each other, and I want my family to be part of it." I'll never forget how after Sherry's first surgery for three weeks, every day like clockwork, someone from the church would show up at our door with meals.
[time=766] They were all part of the ABF groups.
[time=768] And some time later, after her most serious surgery, we were served lunch and dinner for every day of the week for six months.
[time=776] The nurses and professional caregivers were always so amazed when we told them how our church family was helping us.
[time=782] In fact, one night the pastor, as busy as he is, showed up at our door with an evening meal.
[time=788] I've never felt such an outpouring of love in all my life by a church.
[time=792] All I could say to friends was that these people were, well, they were the best example of being filled with a spirit of God with hearts wanting to serve.
[time=802] After Sherry passed away, a precious woman in the church came to me and said she felt like the Lord wanted her to do something for us and would I mind if she cleaned our house every two weeks?
[time=812] Did I mind? Does Billy Graham have a quiet time?
[time=815] Bless her heart.
[time=816] That wonderful woman kept our home sparkling clean for over a year.
[time=819] I never did tell visitors she was doing the cleaning.
[time=822] I just let them think that I was really a great guy.
[time=825] You know, but seriously, all she wanted to do was serve in the same way, just like Jesus did.
[time=832] Well, here we are.
[time=833] Two years later, God continues to bless us.
[time=836] And who would ever thought that getting a haircut would lead to meeting a wonderful lady, to falling in love and now an exciting new marriage?
[time=844] In this church, this church has gone out of its way to make Becky Darcy and me feel at home in our new life together.
[time=852] It's no wonder why many times in the service I sit there with tears running down my face and a heartful of joy and thanksgiving to the Lord for allowing our family to be a part of this precious fellowship called Blackhawk.
[time=863] You caring people, thank you so much for practicing what you teach and for being doers of the word for not only touching my family's life but consistently touching many others as well.
[time=874] All right, so what have I learned?
[time=877] Well, I've learned the real meaning of trusting in the Lord in all circumstances.
[time=881] I've learned how much it means to others when you give of yourself, when you invest yourself in people.
[time=888] I've gained a new perspective on compassion by seeing it in operation all around me here at Blackhawk.
[time=894] I've learned to be a better listener.
[time=896] I now know just how precious a good friend that listens really is.
[time=901] And I've learned that we're here for a brief moment in time and the lives we touch today by serving as Christ served, by loving as Christ loved, and by caring as Christ cared.
[time=915] You can change a life more than you'll ever know.
[time=922] [MUSIC]
[time=1014] When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
[time=1022] when our strength has failed, here the days have done.
[time=1030] When we reach the end of our horde, every source says,
[time=1038] "Our Father's full living is only begun."
[time=1048] His love has no limit.
[time=1052] His grace has no measure.
[time=1057] His power has no boundary, no not to man.
[time=1065] For out of his infinite riches in Jesus.
[time=1079] He gives us, and gives us, and gives us,
[time=1101] again.
[time=1118] Thank you, Gene.
[time=1119] Well, as we continue in our theme this morning of edification, let me invite you to take your Bible if you have it with you this morning come to 1 Thessalonians 5, just for a brief moment as a kind of a jumping off point.
[time=1134] We're looking at our vision for 2002, and we've really finished to this point
[time=1140] our examination of evangelization and how to win the lost and how we would propose to do that in the days ahead.
[time=1147] This morning we want to look at edification and this whole concept that people can build each other up in the Lord.
[time=1154] 1 Thessalonians 5, verse 11 says, "Therefore encourage one another and build up one another just as you also are doing."
[time=1164] That verse really captures the thrust of what the New Testament talks about when it describes the way that believers can relate to each other.
[time=1171] Encourage one another and build one another just as you also are doing.
[time=1177] The Christian experience and growth in the Christian experience and maturity in the Christian experience and moving from the point that you are to the point that you want to be is not a solo sport, it's not a solo activity, it is not done by yourself.
[time=1194] Spending time in prayer and spending time in the Word of God and spending time listening to sermons whether they be here on Sunday or on the radio or however else you listen to them is simply not enough to produce the kind of growth that God intends.
[time=1209] And that is sometimes hard for us to understand because there's a kind or a brand of Christianity out there today that almost says it is enough.
[time=1218] If you just pray and study the Word and listen to the truth, somehow you'll grow to the place that you need to be and that's just not the case.
[time=1225] There's a whole level of personal interaction between Christians that must go on in our lives and it must go on at deep and meaningful levels.
[time=1235] And I just mean by that what's really going on in your life, where the real struggle is, where the real issue is, and when you hold Christians out of that arena, whether we have structured it in such a way that it doesn't occur as it ought to in the church or whether you, on a premeditated intentional basis, hold other believers out of your life on those kinds of issues, you are depleting yourself, you are missing and depriving yourself of one of the major resources that God has structured into the Christian life by which you can grow. That's really what we're going to talk about today, and how that can happen. But before we do, because we're changing from one evangelism edification, I want to review for just a minute.
[time=1279] So take your booklet. I hope you have that in your Bible. If you don't, I'll refer to this if you didn't get one at the door. And come back to the overview of our vision on page 4.
[time=1287] Remember now we started some weeks ago with a basic question in our mind. How, as a church, Black Hawk Baptist Church, how are we going to become and stay and remain effective in reaching our world for the cause of Christ?
[time=1303] What's our strategy? We understand our mission. We understand that we're the great commission. We're to win people to Christ and build them up.
[time=1311] There's no debating that. There's no question about that. The question that remains is how are we going to do it? And how has our culture changed? And how has the life of our church transformed itself to that we have a strategy to move with specific clarity and purpose to effectively do our mission.
[time=1327] And that's what we're talking about. Now notice on pages 4 and 5, it says a strategy for disciple making and it begins with the first step.
[time=1335] And that's the believer there in the dark and he's moving over that bridge outside of the church. He's going outside of the body of the believers to build an authentic relationship with an unbeliever. To where that unsaved person can honestly say that I believe this person whoever it may be, maybe he doesn't even recognize him as a Christian yet, likes me, cares about me, is investing in my life. There's something there coming my direction from that person who happens to be a believer.
[time=1363] In the context of that genuine relationship then, step 2 is for the believer to raise a spoken witness about Christ.
[time=1371] Maybe it's your testimony. Maybe it's the difference that Christ has made in your life.
[time=1375] Maybe it's the opportunity to affirm you believe God's word and it's practical in this area of your life. Any different way of doing that depending upon the situation, but you share your faith with this unbeliever.
[time=1387] This third step is under the recognition that most people upon hearing the gospel don't receive it right away.
[time=1395] Most people aren't ready to make that lifelong commitment just because you've built a relationship with them and share the gospel a time or two. And so we propose outreach services that are designed for the unbeliever, not for us, but for them and the music that we would choose and the drama that we might use and the help of the video that we might employ and the messages themselves are hitting at a level that strike at the basic questions the unbeliever is asking so that they can in a non-threatening way take a step closer to coming to Christ. You remember we tried to put a face and a name to this when we started the series, Heidi and I have been at chairs the previous Saturday night and had met a woman there who was alone, who was lost, who was unsaved, who had been through a divorce, who had all the kinds of common trauma and difficulty that most people in our community are experiencing at one level or another. They're detached, they're empty, they're hurting, and they're lonely.
[time=1455] And the question is how does our church reach those people? How do we effectively connect with them and give them an opportunity to hear the claims of Christ in terms that they understand so they can give their life to the Lord? And that steps one, two, and three, that's how we get them started. And you'll notice the cross at the top of this kind of this icon and that's to represent that that person comes to Christ. And you know and I know a lot of them won't, right? That's up to them and God, but we have to be faithful to be in the process of pursuing them. Many of them will come to Christ.
[time=1491] And the question is, what do we do with them after that?
[time=1495] How does this church minister to them? How does this church take that lady there at LS Airs? Were she to come into this process and come to Christ?
[time=1503] Broken and fragile and hurt and beaten up by this culture and the way that our country is going. How do we take her and build her into a mature godly woman where she herself can be used to reach others for the cause of Christ? And so we kind of turn a corner this morning and come to the topic of edification and that's the beginning step with her and we need it as well on a constant daily basis because life is hard for us though we know the Savior. Edification, building the believer, establishing and encouraging the believer in his or her faith. And we do that through our ABF ministry, the adult Bible fellowship ministry where nearly a thousand adults every single Sunday morning meet in groups of fifty to a hundred and receive instruction in the Word of God and pray together. What we want to talk about this morning is adding to our ministry a small group ministry.
[time=1555] We believe as an elder board and deacons and staff that we need to seriously consider adding a new dimension a deeper level of contact with you, those who are already born again and have been saved the number of years and those who we hope to bring to Christ that we can have them in small groups and we'll talk about that very thing this morning. But maybe just a brief personal word first, what a time for me to be talking about being built up.
[time=1583] What a Sunday for Russell Moore to be speaking on the topic of edification. It's been a really interesting week for me and for my household a lot of difficult things as you know our attendance is a little soft the last couple of weeks giving has been unseasonably light and if that kind of thing were to continue we could really have some very traumatic things to go through. As we begin to talk about the vision a number of you are very very supportive very excited some of you are saying to me you've never been so excited about your church and about the things of God and what could happen others of you might be on the other side of the spectrum others of you are not excited and there are rumors that are going around about our church some of them are true some of them are not true there are some rumors going around about me some of those are true some of those are not true some of those highlight my weaknesses some of those exploit some of my faults all that to say I'm early in the week here was that one of those places I know you've been at in your life where you feel like the sky is coming in and there's no bottom and there's no foothold to stop the descent and you're just emotionally depleted of all your energies that was me Tuesday morning and I came into my office and had absolutely no energy to accomplish the tasks before me so I went down the hall and began to share my heart a little bit with Tim Teder and he began to share his heart with me and I was saying things like Tim what are we doing and are we on the right track and is this worth it all and how do you keep going when you feel this way and as you begin to speak it was almost as if well the image that came to my mind was like I was a battery a car battery that had been left on too long and out in the cold and it was dead you know boom and you hit the ignition and nothing happens just kind of a grinding something that was how I was feeling it was as if somebody took jumper cables and I was hooking on to Tim Teder as he began to share
[time=1697] his heart and his excitement and his enthusiasm and his conviction about the principles represented about winning people to Christ and discipling them into mature followers of Christ
[time=1707] and after 10 or 15 minutes I walked out there a little bit more encouraged but certainly still on the low side so I ran into Steve Longbreak and we did the same thing I shared my heart with him where I was really at and how hard it really felt and how empty the whole experience left me and it was as if I'd hooked up to him because he began to share his
[time=1725] convictions and his desires and his hopes and his dreams for all the stuff we've been working on
[time=1731] ended up speaking with one of our elders and he did the same thing over the phone and I felt a little more charged
[time=1737] later that day another one of our elders who I didn't even have an appointment with just kind of stopped in
[time=1743] and spent 15 minutes with me listening to my heart and refurbishing me and helping me and encouraging and strengthening and sharing his own convictions about all this stuff. The next day I was with a man who is younger in the Lord and far less mature than anybody else I've mentioned somebody I've been
[time=1759] investing in for a couple of years shared my heart with him because we have that kind of relationship and he
[time=1765] encouraged me. I mean here's a guy I was supposed to be investing in now he turns around and makes huge deposits in my sense of courage and let's do this and it's hard but that's okay that's what makes it exciting. So I want you to know I'm not talking about like words today okay this is not a sermon about something
[time=1782] that isn't real in my life and I know if I experience these kinds of things you must experience these kinds of
[time=1788] things. And the fear and the level of concern is this that many of you do not have the kinds of people
[time=1796] resources that I happen to have to hook up to. Many of you are walking around with your battery
[time=1802] cables going where do I you know who do I trust and who do I who can I count on to give me godly
[time=1808] wisdom and advice and so many of us in this church don't have a place to connect and when you hit low
[time=1815] points it's kind of just you and you alone and you're stripped of some of the really important dynamics that can occur inside of Christian community some of the stuff that can happen inside of small groups where people can be honest where people can share how they're really feeling. Let me say it
[time=1831] to you this way small groups is just a word it doesn't mean much except for what's behind it.
[time=1837] It's where people get together sometimes they get together around certain interests like golf or eating
[time=1845] or crocheting or shopping or whatever it doesn't matter what that is where believers have a common
[time=1851] interest and they find themselves in relationship with each other but they do something.
[time=1856] They covenant to do more than just the thing they have in common as far as the activity.
[time=1862] They covenant in their hearts to grow together for the glory of God sometimes that's a spoken
[time=1868] commitment sometimes that's an unspoken commitment and as a result of that commitment they recognize
[time=1874] that the real value inside their relationships and they enjoy they involve others in that to
[time=1880] balance the perspectives is really about stimulating and encouraging and building one another up
[time=1886] into Christ likeness. As a result their conversation moves into the areas of real struggle in their
[time=1894] life so that at that point of exposure real words of encouragement can be both educational and uplifting
[time=1902] and encouraging. That's really all it is it's friendships with spiritual goals and as
[time=1910] as the leadership of this church has looked at our church we believe that's happening and it happens in in in in different people's lives in different ways and that always will
[time=1920] be the case but we recognize there's there's nothing in our church that's really facilitating that process for you if you find that you kind of have to find that on your own and we're saying
[time=1930] in vision 2002 no we think we can do better than that. So this morning let me give you two reasons
[time=1936] specific reasons why I believe in a small group ministry why I believe our church needs to move in the direction of a small group ministry and the benefits that I think will come to us the strength that will come to us as we do that the first as you might expect is this it's biblical the small group ministry is biblical from stem to stern from beginning to end the
[time=1955] whole nine yards it is in fact the priority ministry in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ
[time=1961] you think about this for a minute you've got a guy you've got a person you've got a man you've got
[time=1967] the Lord Jesus Christ and he has a mission to impact the entire world but he only lives
[time=1973] for 33 years in a very isolated part of the planet it's true that he is God it's true
[time=1979] that he worked miracles it is true that without his sacrificial death his burial his
[time=1985] resurrection nothing could happen because our sins could not be cared for and we would die in our sins but it's also equally true that if you and I don't hear about what he did
[time=1996] if you and I don't find out about what he accomplished then he may as well have not done it because we can't put our faith in something we've never heard about and so you say what was his strategy did he start a big organization with with
[time=2010] presidents and vice presidents and all kinds of middle management it wasn't a great communication campaign to try to just put the word out to everybody all at once while he was on earth and remember he only had three and a half years of public ministry he never did that did he start a writing ministry himself he never did that you know
[time=2028] what he did he spent the majority of his time in his ministry with 12 guys a small
[time=2034] group a small group of guys and he said I'm going to so invest my life in you that
[time=2042] after I am dead and gone you will be so changed and transformed by the close
[time=2048] encounter of our relationship that you will carry it with you the rest of your life and that is exactly what happened that is exactly what happened you and I have
[time=2059] our Christian faith today because those 12 men the one accepting who was not saved
[time=2065] Judas the traitor the 11 and the one that replaced him because those men in a very small group of people outside of that you always there were only 120 followers in
[time=2076] Acts 2 when the Holy Spirit came a whole life and he comes up with 120 people
[time=2082] hanging around to be ministered to by the Holy Spirit maybe a total of 500 followers
[time=2088] devout followers of Christ by the end of his life in ministry but there were 11 guys there were 11 guys who he let into his life and as a result transformed them
[time=2101] completely I believe that's essential to growth I believe that is absolutely
[time=2107] essential to your growth and to your being changed think about it for a minute those those 11 guys 12 guys Jesus could have called them into a classroom right he could have said okay we're going to do a traditional seminary approach here I've got three years with you which is how long most seminary is take guys we're going to meet at such and such a building and such is such a room for three years I'll stand behind the lecture and Jesus could have said and I'll teach you like by talking at you everything I want you to know he could have done that for three and a half years he could have talked to them about trust he could have said
[time=2141] this you need to trust me no matter what happens they would have heard that they could have answered that yes on a test they would have walked out but look at what happened instead because he refused to teach them that way though he did instruct them he did teach them the vast majority of the life change occurred because they were in the boat with him when he was asleep and the sea of
[time=2164] Galilee began to storm and many of these seasoned sailors and fishermen who had
[time=2170] grown up on that lake were convinced that they were going to die that night in
[time=2176] that boat and Jesus was asleep now they had no doubt heard that they could
[time=2182] trust him they had no doubt heard that they had a sovereign god they had been instructed in these truths but watch the learning experience because they were in his life they wake him up they're absolutely panicked he sees their panicked
[time=2200] condition because they're in a real life situation and confronts it oh ye of faith oh that's a learning experience I'm caught found wanting that's educational
[time=2213] folks that's life changing then he stands up and goes basically and the entire
[time=2219] sea just stops all the waves stop all the wind stops all the ripples stop I mean it's just like glass early in the morning and they look around and they look at him and because they were there and because they experienced it and because it was in the context of their own lack of faith they suddenly learn volumes about what
[time=2241] it means to trust God things they could never have learned in a classroom if he had stayed behind the lecture right there's a little time later when there was a
[time=2252] whole bunch of people maybe 20,000 people 5,000 heads of households and usually three other people with that particular family so we estimate 20,000 people and they were hungry they've been into this ministry thing and everybody lost track of time and suddenly there was this mob of people and Jesus said let's feed him you know he could have told them I'm capable of taking fish and loaves and turning it into like lots of stuff but because they're with him and because he says I want we're gonna feed them they're like panicked they're in the experience they're living the trauma they're very alert it's called a reachable moment and then he takes these few fish and loaves and feeds everybody but what I think is so wonderful about the story is that when it's all set and done he doesn't say okay guys let's go he doesn't say okay guys get the point he says okay guys go pick up what's extra go pick up what's extra go out
[time=2304] there in that whole acreage and start picking up all the stuff that was left over after they eaten everything they could eat that I produced and never forget this I am God you can trust me you can follow me if I tell you to do
[time=2319] something and if I tell you the resources are there which he was going to do very soon in their life you can count on the fact that it's there you see you just learn those lessons in a classroom you hear about those kinds of things in a classroom you don't learn those things in a classroom how about Peter let me just a narrow in on one guy he was so confident that he
[time=2340] would never deny the Lord he was so confident that his love and his commitment to God so surpassed the other guys that he even got a little cocky about it and said something in public that he would never be caught doing that within a few days a few hours actually he had denied the Lord not once not twice
[time=2361] but three times but you know what happens after the ascension of Christ you know
[time=2367] when comes the crucifixion barrel in the ascension Jesus seeks him out and finds him on the seashore there and he's going to complete the learning process he says Peter do you love me Peter a second time do you love me Peter a third time do you love me he comes back into that disciples life who had failed miserably
[time=2387] you see when you let people into your life you let them show you who they really are and what their real struggles are and you're able to be seen for the failure that you are but the people come back and say I love you anyway we can do this together and so he says do you love me Peter says yes then do what I've told you to do feed my sheep do you love me he says yes a second time then obey me ten my lambs do you get the drift I mean Jesus is in this guy's face in a powerful way transforming his life that kind of life transformation doesn't happen when you're sitting in a chair and somebody's standing behind a lectern you can think of Thomas who had heard it all and seen it all but still needed one
[time=2430] last final hands-on authentic learning lesson when he said I don't believe I
[time=2436] don't believe that he came back from the dead I got my questions why could he say
[time=2442] that because he was in a group of guys who he knew and who he loved he'd been with for three years and he could open his heart a little bit and say the truth about himself he could say I don't buy it I don't really think he came out of the grave what a learning experience when Jesus shows up with those same guys who he
[time=2460] knew he was honest with before about not believing that Jesus had done and he says hey man feel right here it's me I'm back and you learn in those kinds of
[time=2472] situations don't you I believe it's biblical I believe we do you a great
[time=2481] disservice when we commit to train you only through lecture only through the
[time=2488] lecture of the pulpit and only through the lecture of the ABF and only through the lecture of a particular Bible study that's just about studying the Bible I believe that what we see described in the scriptures is people coming together where they can trust each other and share the ins and the outs of their life the traumas the hardships and in those moments be meaningfully touched by another Christian and built up I think we are phenomenal at it as a church when it
[time=2517] comes to some of the physical crisis problems and Jeff Carlson so wonderfully articulates what hundreds of us could say about our church the need for the meals and the need for the cleaning and the need for the help but we may not be
[time=2532] as successful or as accomplished yet at being able to meet some of those
[time=2538] spiritual crisis needs and that's what we want ahead as a family that's what we
[time=2545] want ahead as a church we want to be able to put things in place that create a corporate culture and an environment where it's in the right context and with the right leadership it's it's really understood to be profitable and productive to be able to share the real condition of a person's life and get the kind of help that the Bible tells us we get from one another maybe the best illustration of this that I can think of so far is what happens if this other church challenges us to soccer their leadership against our leadership and we say we don't want to challenge you we're not sure because our guys don't play soccer and that's the guy in the online says well that's exactly why we pick soccer because ours don't play soccer either so we're all starting from ground zero we'll see you guys in three months at such and such a field on Saturday morning at such and such a time let's do it so we're excited about the
[time=2594] challenge we're up for a good game let's get after it so we pick our leaders out of our elders and staff and deacons who we think are the the most on I mean the most athletic and it's slim pickings I grant you that but we pick our most we pick our most I include myself in this we we pick our most athletic guys and none of us know anything about soccer but we got to get it together so we hire ourselves the best coach we can find maybe he's a college level coach and and we pay him some good money and he says all right guys we're gonna do it every single Saturday we're here for three hours we start at seven we stop three hours later and we're gonna hit it we're gonna hit it hard and we're gonna win and we're all pumped up about that we like that we're excited about that that sounds good he says now come on in here and we go in a classroom and he stands
[time=2638] behind a lectern and he begins to talk to us about soccer every Saturday for
[time=2646] three months he brings in overheads and charts and draws on the board we learned the history of soccer we learn where the ball came from and it's evolution in size we learned this the dimensions of the field we begin to learn the positions and we begin to say okay you're gonna play that position and we learned the history of that position and this guy's good he tells us stories of previous soccer players and we're weeping some Saturday morning we can't believe what a heroic moment that was in soccer history I mean it's great we're having a good time we're going out of their charge we're gonna win we're pumped up he tells us here's how you kick a ball you kick a ball the side of your foot not the tip of your foot because the side of your foot is flat and you can direct the round object in the direction you'd like to go he tells us how to pass he tells us how to block goals he tells us everything I mean I'm I mean to say at the end of this three month period we would get like straight A's on the examination the other church well they take a different tack they
[time=2700] don't have a lot extra money around so they go ahead and they don't know who to get so they ask around the church they find out somebody's kid you know plays soccer and that this dad coached him like a couple of years he never played in high school college he just picked it up you know because his kid was in it they show up they're gonna do the same thing they're gonna meet every Saturday for three months for three hours and this dad shows up and says hey I don't know a lot about this I'll teach you what I know come on over here on on the on the field see he's got a few soccer balls she's now first thing I learned to do is
[time=2732] how to kick this thing you kick this thing with the side of your foot not the toe the side of your foot you kick it from the toe it goes any which way you got it they'll go oh yeah we got it no problem coach we understand it so then he says because he knows they don't he says Deakin number one come on over here Deakin number one hustles over she's now demonstrating so Deakin number one doing off the top of his toe it goes off to the left he he's like it's wrong doing he does it again the guy says no no the side of your foot oh the side of my that's why you said the side of my foot didn't you yeah the side really go boom he tries it it went where it was supposed to go Deakin 2 Deakin 3 now he's got all the deeks lining up on this line kicking balls like this they're getting really good they're kicking them to each other they're catching on then he says you got a lead a guy okay a guy's running down the field you got to kick it out in front of him so when he gets there the balls there if you kick it where he is when he starts running he's already passed you scoop a deep one kicks it where he was standing right and guys long gone his buddy's laughing he said out in front oh I get out in front pretty soon these guys can pass to each other it goes on like this they never learned the history they never learned a lot of stuff about it but you know what they get some fundamentals down really well in their life not from a professional coach but from just a guy that knows about that much more than they do right what happens on Saturday the big Saturday we show up in mass and when we got the stands we're full there's a little little church there's a little few people over there we get smoked we get smeared why because we have relied on an educational tool that
[time=2825] requires transfer knowledge we never got to try it we never got to experiment with it we never got to fail in front of a helpful person who corrects our impressions so we get killed I don't understand why we do that spiritually
[time=2843] why are we spending all of our resources and all of our dollars so that you can sit and either I can talk or your abf teacher can talk and you can sit again now I think those are important the preaching of God's word the declaration of his truth the coming together you cannot you can never displace that and we don't want to displace it here or in the abf ministry vital things happen because information does impact how you live but if we could just add this one other element getting us in the context of real life situations with others of
[time=2880] us and maybe they're not super spiritual people maybe they're just a little further down the road than we are like that dad was but if you give us an environment to struggle honestly with our lives and try to apply the things that we've heard when we don't get it quite right somebody's there to pick us up and say it again and I get it now I can I can actually do it now I think our
[time=2902] learning curve goes up and I think our church becomes more effective in the edification process and I think we give more glory to God I'm excited about that
[time=2913] I'm really excited as I look back over my life I want you to know something I have been powerfully impacted by various messages and I can probably tell you which ones they've been but I want you to know far and away the greatest life changes that have ever occurred in my life are the result of people in my life who took time and who cared and who invested and who let me struggle and who let me fail and who picked me up and put me back on my feet and you know what there's just this we were just this great number of people many of us are
[time=2947] capable of that kind of ministry with the right training the right supervision we can pull this off let me give you a second reason why I think it's really
[time=2958] important for us to consider moving in the direction of small groups because it's really practical in other words let me go a little bit further on the
[time=2969] thought come back to your booklet now for just a second and go to the very last the last page of it actually on the cover the back cover and you'll see a picture of a sand dollar and this boy this illustration and this truth caught
[time=2982] the leadership I mean it took us by storm when we saw this okay this was a Saturday not too many months ago when we were working on our vision and looking at our church when we saw this illustration lights started to go on in our heads and we began to see oh we get it now this sand dollar is to represent
[time=3000] like 50 to 100 people like you would have in one of our ABS and what they're saying is there are certain dynamics that go on inside of a group of 50 to 100 people no matter who the hundred people are no matter what they're intending there are certain dynamics that happen in groups of people this particular size they're saying that basically there's two groups of people inside there there are the insiders and there are the newcomers or the outsiders you can read a little verbiage there insiders are bound together by past experiences common interests family ties and effectively minister to one another the newcomer and the outsider they're in the big group but they don't
[time=3040] gain entry into the inside group within a short time and they begin to feel marginal they will either hang around in silent desperation or be susceptible to dropping out now when we first talked about this as a leadership team guess where all the leaders were we were all on the inside right we were in the dark
[time=3059] sections where we already have connected relationships and meaningful things going on in our lives we come to the abf there are five or six other families there that we've known for a long time who we minister with and understand us and our needs are met in this category and so when someone suggested that it wasn't that way for everybody in the abf it was like well why not it's that way for me and we were unable to identify that for many people in the abf they're
[time=3086] outsiders oh they're inside they're inside the abf and they're on the perilous they go to socials and they come pretty regularly on Sunday mornings but you asked them are deep levels of fellowship being met in your life do you have people with whom you can share honestly about the real concerns in your life and according to the survey we took a year ago about 50% of us said no no
[time=3110] we're no honestly no I wish there were more I need more and and about 50%
[time=3116] indicated a willingness to get into a discipling relationship or a small group relationship in other words while the while the abf ministry is perfect for
[time=3125] what it does it can't do enough by virtue of its size there are limitations
[time=3132] that impact what can actually be done for example suppose a woman came to an abf one day and she just found out the night before that her husband was leaving her in fact he packed and he left now she comes to church the next morning in desperate need of some things she comes to her abf do you realize how inappropriate it would be for her to share that with all 50 people I mean really share the background of it and the hurts that came with it and and really get some of that stuff on the table so that people could properly encourage her first of all it would take probably the entire hour wouldn't it secondly there are a bunch of people that abf some may be new some she may only know by name some she may not not know by name it would be inappropriate so she shares it with a
[time=3175] couple of friends those couple of friends hopefully covenant to meet with her later in the week maybe some of them just say I'll pray for you and maybe that just continues to to to heighten the level of superficiality that can go on inside of a church now suppose that there's only 50 people 52 to make it
[time=3194] exact in the abf would it be unreasonable that each person in there might have a tremendously traumatic experience in a given year maybe your husband doesn't leave but maybe there's an illness maybe a relative dies maybe there's a job change or a job loss so there's the potential of every single week having another crisis and if you tried to deal with it in that setting you'd never get the word taught you understand there are structural limitations that but put yourself in a small group of six people who meet every week for the very purpose of checking into another person's life how's it really going well there's
[time=3229] plenty of time for people to share and when one person really does hit a major pothole in their life we could set the next three or four weeks aside to listening and caring and understanding and moving into that person's life it almost as we have it structured is planned neglect it almost sends a message out that the deepest level of fellowship we're willing as a church to organize strategize and provide is an abf level of fellowship if you're gonna
[time=3256] have more than that you gotta kind of get it on your own it's just a number of us who believe we can do better than that and that if we do better than that lives will change and change powerfully and change wonderfully well let me just
[time=3274] close this morning by saying this to you my heart goes out to some of you you're like I was a number of years ago when I first came to Christ I went to this college Bible study and I heard this one guy say to another guy I love
[time=3289] you brother and it was like whoo what was that and I looked at the two of them
[time=3296] and they didn't look like brothers physically but I continued to watch and
[time=3304] though it was a little eerie at times to see the level of love and the level of fellowship and the level of commitment that they had to each other it kind of scared me a little bit at first but I watch it some more and some more and some more and some more and pretty soon I realized these guys were meeting on a weekly basis to hold each other accountable to ask the hard questions to fight through the difficult situations when one guy wanted to quit six guys said no way when another guy got a little cocky six guys said you're a little cocky you need to back off a little bit here I mean all the big stuff that they would go through together they went through together and I began to really desire that in my own life and eventually by God's grace found some of it and I've told you this before one of my first parties when I came to the city was to find those kinds of people for my life and by God's grace they're in my life and they've been active this week helping me stand up man I want that for
[time=3355] you I want that for our church many of you I know feel a little bit like ooh I
[time=3361] don't know if I could trust people like this I don't know how I can say to you is once you taste it and once you experience it you will wonder how you
[time=3372] ever made it without it and maybe by God's grace as we continue to pursue this
[time=3378] direction we'll see it in in all dimensions of our church maybe it'll become part of our church maybe it'll be part of what we are as a church deep intimate caring levels of personal fellowship through small groups let's pray together well it's amazing all that God has in store for his children for those who
[time=3409] have accepted Christ as their Lord and Savior I'm certain that some of you today who are watching this program as you look in your own heart you know you're not truly saved you don't have a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ and you'd like that let me invite you to bow your head and pray with me follow along in your own heart and say these words as I lead you in this prayer to accept Christ as your Savior father I know that I am a sinner I know that I have failed I know that I am not all that you would want me to be and that the consequences of that are death eternal death I believe in Jesus Christ as my
[time=3444] Lord and Savior and I put my faith in him today accept him into my life and the forgiveness of sins and the eternal life that comes with that forgiveness and I thank you for these things in Jesus name amen if you prayed with me just now to
