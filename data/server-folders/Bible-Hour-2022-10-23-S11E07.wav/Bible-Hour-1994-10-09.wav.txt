[time=23] Thank you for joining us.
[time=25] Have you ever had that bigger-than-life experience where looking back at a particular situation you knew you were God's instrument to make a contribution to shape, mold and develop a life for the cause of Christ?
[time=39] If you haven't, you're in for a big surprise.
[time=42] There may not be any more exciting and fulfilling experience in all the Christian life than this.

[time=352] Now let's return to our Sunday morning service.
[time=366] Sometimes it's hard for me to understand why we pull away from each other so easily.
[time=379] Even though we're all walking the same road, it will build dividing walls between our brothers
[time=392] and ourselves.
[time=397] But I, I don't care what label you may wear.
[time=404] If you believe in Jesus, you'll be long with me.
[time=410] The bond we share is all I care to see.
[time=415] And we'll change the world forever if you will join with me.
[time=423] Join and sing.
[time=425] Sing, you're my brother, you're my sister.
[time=431] So take me by the hand.
[time=435] Together we will work until he comes.
[time=442] There's no foe that can defeat us when we walk inside by side.
[time=450] As long as there is love, we will stand.
[time=458] The day will come when we will be as one.
[time=469] In the mighty boy, together we will proclaim that Jesus.
[time=477] Jesus is our King.
[time=480] It will echo through the earth with reshaping the nations.
[time=487] And the world will see.
[time=490] See that you're my brother, you're my sister.
[time=495] So take me by the hand.
[time=499] Together we will work until he comes.
[time=506] There's no foe that can defeat us when we walk inside by side.
[time=515] As long as there is love, we will stand.
[time=525] Come and take me by the hand.
[time=531] Join with me.
[time=535] Join and sing.
[time=538] Sing, you're my brother, you're my sister.
[time=543] So take me by the hand.
[time=547] Together we will work until he comes.
[time=554] There's no foe that can defeat us when we walk inside by side.
[time=562] As long as there is love, we will stand.
[time=569] You're my brother, you're my sister.
[time=573] So take me by the hand.
[time=579] Together we will work until he comes.
[time=584] There's no foe that can defeat us when we walk inside by side.
[time=592] As long as there is love, we will stand.
[time=599] You're my brother, you're my sister.
[time=603] So take me by the hand.
[time=607] Together we will work until he comes.
[time=614] There's no foe that can defeat us when we walk inside by side.
[time=622] As long as there is love, we will stand.
[time=639] Well hello there and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=641] We're thankful that you've joined us today.
[time=643] We trust that you'll be encouraged as you stay with us through the duration of our program.
[time=649] As you know, we've been talking about rekindling the Black Hawk spirit.
[time=653] We've been bringing a series of messages about our church and about the things we want to try to accomplish in the days that are ahead of us.
[time=660] We trust that it's been stimulating as you think about your own walk with God and the involvement that you have in your own local church.
[time=666] And I'm sure some of the same themes run through the emphasis of your church.
[time=671] Today we're going to be talking about equipping the saints for the work of the ministry.
[time=676] And I just want to invite you today as you watch this service to think about your own spiritual gifts, your own level of ministry in your church and to be thinking about whether or not you're truly serving God through building your local church as he would have you.
[time=691] If you're that part of the body that is faithfully contributing and making things happen in an organized and orderly fashion by contributing those unique gifts which only you can bring.
[time=700] And so I trust that in this time today you won't just be listening to a sermon about our church.
[time=705] You'll be listening to a sermon about you and how you can be effective in your local church.
[time=710] Also, we want to let you know about the Promise Keepers Leadership Conference that's coming to Fort Wayne, Indiana, October 28 and 29.
[time=718] Black Hawk has the privilege of hosting this event. It's not a Black Hawk event, really.
[time=722] It's a Promise Keepers event. And we're just having the privilege of extending some hospitality.
[time=727] But we want to encourage any and all of you men who are aware of Promise Keepers.
[time=732] Maybe you've never been to a Promise Keepers event before, but you've heard other Christians talk about it.
[time=737] And maybe you're even feeling a little on the outside because you haven't had a chance to go to one of those events.
[time=742] And you're hearing about this leadership conference and wondering if you would be welcome.
[time=747] The answer is yes. You don't have to have gone to any previous event.
[time=750] You don't have to even know anything about Promise Keepers.
[time=752] You just have to know that you want to grow and be challenged in your walk with God as a man who would keep your promises.
[time=758] Promises of integrity to God and your family, your employer, your children, your friends.
[time=763] A tremendous time of revitalization for you and for your life.
[time=766] Let me encourage you to call our church and understand how you can register for this event.
[time=772] Well, at this time, let's go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=782] I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[time=796] But sometimes I wonder what he can do through me.
[time=806] No great success to show.
[time=811] No glory on my own.
[time=815] Yet in my weakness he is there to let me know.
[time=825] His strength is perfect when our strength is gone.
[time=835] He'll carry us when we can carry on.
[time=845] His strength and power the weak becomes strong.
[time=856] His strength is perfect.
[time=880] We can only know the power that he holds when we truly see how deep our weakness goes.
[time=900] His strength in us begins where ours comes to an end.
[time=910] Here's our humble cry and rose again.
[time=920] His strength is perfect when our strength is gone.
[time=931] He'll carry us when we can carry on.
[time=941] Raised in his power the weak becomes strong.
[time=952] His strength is perfect.
[time=963] Raised in his power.
[time=970] The weak becomes strong.
[time=981] His strength is perfect.
[time=1011] [AMEN] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come to Ephesians chapter 4.
[time=1022] We want to look at this theme of equipping the saints.
[time=1026] I can hardly come to this particular passage and a couple of other ones in the New Testament that have this word equipping in it.
[time=1034] Without remembering, well for me the summer of 1975 it was between my junior and senior year in high school.
[time=1042] And like most high school students I was anticipating the summer with a great sense of excitement for all the fun we would have.
[time=1049] And school let out on a couple of buddies with one of my buddies parents and family headed for a lake just to get the week started or the summer started right.
[time=1056] And so we spent the week up there water skiing and horsing around and doing the crazy things you do.
[time=1061] And just thinking man this is going to be a summer of all summers.
[time=1065] Then we came home and the very next day I jumped on a friend's motorcycle.
[time=1069] It was a 365 Yamaha Enduro which means that it could go both on the street and on the dirt off road which means it had big knobby tires on the back.
[time=1078] I didn't know it but the back fender of this motorcycle was broken and so it was hanging and flopping a lot more than it normally would.
[time=1087] I was driving down the street at about 55 miles an hour and went over a bump and it compressed the shocks on the motorcycle.
[time=1093] And that allowed the back fender to get caught by the back wheel which had big knobbies on it.
[time=1098] It sucked the fender up underneath and the bike bounced twice on its back wheel and then landed on my foot.
[time=1104] It broke every major bone across my right foot.
[time=1108] And my doctor who had just treated my feet for several months for a certain deformity that I was born with
[time=1115] and who had thought the whole thing had been done and had been done right and we were off and running so to speak.
[time=1120] We called him and let him know that I had just broken every single major bone in my right foot and he said well that's just fine.
[time=1127] And I'm going on vacation and Russell can just lay in bed for seven days and think about the stupidity of his behavior.
[time=1135] Which my parents given a hardy amen too.
[time=1139] And so I laid there for seven days and looked at this foot sticking up in the air and had to take painkillers as it was swollen and all that stuff.
[time=1146] And I realized that all my hopes and all my dreams for this summer had just vaporized and I was going to spend the rest of it trying to put this foot back together.
[time=1155] And I'm thankful that he eventually did get home from my doctor from vacation and I was taken into the office there and with no anesthetic.
[time=1162] I think also just to punctuate the learning experience for my benefit he set my foot and just kind of pushed it back into shape and it stayed in the cast for three months and it was better.
[time=1171] And you know for most intense and practical purposes I have a normal foot and I can do what normal people can do.
[time=1177] But what I want you to consider for a moment is what would have happened if there were no such thing as a doctor and if that foot could not have been set.
[time=1184] And if it just had to remain with these bones completely broken and off center to each other and not touching each other.
[time=1191] I mean imagine. I guess you'd end up walking around on a crutch all your life or with crutches because I guess maybe at some point would your foot develop enough calluses and a partial healing that you could use it in some subordinated way.
[time=1206] I don't know. It wouldn't be my idea of a good time.
[time=1210] The point I'm trying to make is this. When God talks about Christians being trained for ministry he uses a medical word that talks about setting broken bones.
[time=1227] And so the imagery that we have in our minds here is that of our lives being realigned or we are trained in such a way that what was useless becomes incredibly useful because the process of setting has been done right.
[time=1248] That's the word equipping here in your text Ephesians 4 verses 11 and 12. Look at that. It says that God gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as pastors and teachers.
[time=1261] Now the apostles and the prophets were for the early church their day is over. So what you're left with are the evangelists and the pastor teachers.
[time=1269] Now why did God give those to the church? Verse 12 for the equipping of the saints. Now that's our word equipping.
[time=1277] Caught our kid Tidso and if you could speak Greek every time you hear that word equipping your mind would go to a doctor setting broken bones.
[time=1285] And so as we talk about equipping today we're having that as a backdrop.
[time=1290] And as you know in our series we've talked about evangelism, winning people to Christ.
[time=1295] The next step in our philosophy of ministry is to edify them and build them up so that they feel loved and secure and have accountability and deep meaningful Christian friendships.
[time=1304] And the next phase in their life, the next piece in the puzzle is for them to be equipped for the bones to be set straight so that they can be useful to God to minister on his behalf.
[time=1315] Okay? And from this passage this morning let's just take three very simple points. The pattern for equipping? I mean that's the question that's raised.
[time=1323] How then do these people get equipped? I understand how it happens when a foot is broken but how does it happen with my life?
[time=1329] How does the church set people's lives in such a way that it can be useful? So what's the pattern for that?
[time=1335] Then the text gives us a powerful picture that really draws I think the emotional flavor into the text and then finally it lists a program.
[time=1344] How to do it even more specifically. So the pattern, the picture and the program. Let's begin with the pattern and there are three steps to it.
[time=1352] Three steps to the basic pattern they are found right there in verses 11 and 12.
[time=1356] First of all God gives evangelists and pastors and teachers for the equipping of the saints. Stop right there. That's step one.
[time=1365] In God's design the way the church gets healthy and strong and can be used and useful for ministry is God gives evangelists and pastors and teachers or pastor teachers who will equip the saints, who will train the saints, who will strengthen the saints, who will establish the saints.
[time=1385] That's step one. Now look at step two also in verse 12. For the equipping of the saints, now here comes part two, for the work of service.
[time=1394] And this I think is astonishing for some people who maybe have never studied this text. Do you realize that the people who are supposed to do the work of the ministry inside the body?
[time=1405] It isn't the pastor. It isn't the evangelist. It's you. It's the saints. The job of the evangelist and the pastor teacher is to equip the saints.
[time=1417] That's you so that you can do the work of service. And the idea here is that the needs of the believer are so diverse and so extensive that no one pastor or no group of pastors could ever minister to the entire congregation
[time=1434] at the level of intimacy and the level of involvement that the Bible describes as healthy and normal.
[time=1441] There's just no way. You'd never have enough money to hire enough people to minister at the intimate levels that the Bible describes.
[time=1449] So the plan that God has is you have some staff members and some elders who do the work of equipping. Their job is to get you ready to minister to yourself.
[time=1463] And that's where the work of the ministry goes. That's how that process occurs. Now step three in the pattern, also the end of verse 12.
[time=1470] You get equipped for the work by your pastor teacher, by your evangelist. So that step two, you can do the work of the ministry.
[time=1478] What happens? Step three, the building up of the body of Christ. There at the end of verse 12.
[time=1484] When the pastors and the teachers and the evangelists equip the saints.
[time=1490] And when the saints do the work of the ministry, the third thing happens, the whole body gets built up.
[time=1497] Now there's some elaboration on that in verse 13. And this is exciting. What does that mean? What does a built body look like?
[time=1505] Well he answers that five characteristics in verse 13 of a built up body. Number one, it's unity. Look at it.
[time=1512] We'll attain to the unity of the faith. And this isn't a kind of mushy, spineless, principleless unity that the world wants to try to talk about where our highest priority is that we love each other and that we get along with each other.
[time=1525] And so you do your thing and I'll do my thing and we'll just coexist and be happy in that some kind of false unity.
[time=1532] This is the unity of the faith. The article in front of faith means the unity that is built around the doctrine of the faith.
[time=1539] And that by the way is the only kind of real unity that can ever exist.
[time=1542] It is when you and I agree to agree with God, then we have unity. That is the only time we have unity.
[time=1548] So the first thing that happens is there's true genuine unity, the kind that Becky sang about because we're committed to the same truth in God's Word.
[time=1557] The second product in verse 13 is right there it follows and of the knowledge of the Son of God.
[time=1565] It's not just cognitive unity, it is a unity that is the passionate love of Jesus Christ.
[time=1570] The word knowledge is that intimate husband/wife knowledge that the Bible uses where the man knew his wife and is talking about the physical relationships in the bedroom.
[time=1579] That is what is being described. When the church functions as it ought to, there's unity around doctrine and there's a growing, deepening passion of love for the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1590] And we get closer to each other because we're getting closer to him.
[time=1594] And the third thing there in verse 13 is as we get closer to him, we become more like him.
[time=1600] That's what it means there. A mature man to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ.
[time=1606] You see that? We become more like Christ. We have his attitudes, we have his thoughts, we have his speech patterns, we have his life behaviors, we have his love for the lost, we have his commitment to serve and win people for Christ, we just begin to look like Christ.
[time=1620] The fourth step, or the fourth product rather, is found in verse 14.
[time=1625] We are doctrinally sound and therefore we can't be influenced by false doctrine.
[time=1632] You see that in verse 14. As a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men, by the craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[time=1642] What are children? Children are gullible. Children believe anything you tell them. Children haven't lived long enough and don't know enough to not be taken, you know, by your little scheme.
[time=1651] This is describing in mature church because it's followed the pattern of God.
[time=1655] Leaders equip the saints, the saints do the work of the ministry and the saints get built up as they minister to each other, the product.
[time=1662] Unity, intimate relationship with Christ, a Christ likeness and fourthly profound strength and doctrine where we are no longer susceptible to being led astray.
[time=1673] And then the fifth. That's found in verse 15.
[time=1677] And that is speaking the truth in love.
[time=1682] One of the byproducts is that you speak the truth in love.
[time=1685] That has to be the strongest phrase in all the word of God to describe meaningful relationships of integrity.
[time=1694] You know you are in a strong, vital, life-changing relationship when that relationship is characterized by speaking the truth in love.
[time=1706] You honestly communicate but it is guarded and protected by the motive of love. It's not just sharing to share. It's not just dumping your guts.
[time=1714] It's not saying I got to say this for me. It's saying I need to say some things for you.
[time=1718] I'm concerned about your growth and your prosperity as a Christian as you prosper in the love of God.
[time=1724] And I don't think it's just reserved by the way to Christians talking to Christians.
[time=1728] What is evangelism? What is evangelism? If it isn't anything, it's speaking the truth and love to an unbeliever.
[time=1735] I love you. I care about you. And here are some things you need to think about with regard to your eternal destiny, the person of Jesus Christ, your own personal sin, forgiveness, relationships.
[time=1744] That too is speaking the truth in love. So it seems as if if we'll follow the pattern that God lays down.
[time=1751] And this by the way is the only pattern that God lays down for how you equip people.
[time=1756] You have your pastors, your teachers, your evangelists. They do the training so that the saints can do the work of the ministry so that the body is built up.
[time=1764] And the ultimate end of that, speaking the truth in love, godly, meaningful relationships in the family of God.
[time=1770] And these people inside the family can then have those kinds of relationships with people outside the family.
[time=1776] In which the truth can be spoken in love. So there it is. God's pattern. God's blueprint. But it's more than that.
[time=1785] It's much more than that. Now we'll come to the picture. And this gets exciting.
[time=1790] I want you to notice that Paul is really packing some stuff in here. Look at the end of verse 12.
[time=1796] He says that we are the body of Christ. He didn't just call us the ecclesia, the called out ones, which is the typical New Testament word for the church.
[time=1805] He throws us into a metaphor called the body of Christ.
[time=1810] And you say if we're the body who's the head? Look at verse 15. At the end of that verse it says that Christ is the head.
[time=1819] So here's the idea. He wants to move from the known to the unknown. Here's what you know about.
[time=1825] You know about your body, right? You know about your head. It's pretty simple.
[time=1829] Your head is the one that thinks, decides, chooses, acts, gives directions, gives impulses, says we're going to go here, says we're going to do this, right?
[time=1837] That's this job right here, your head. Everything from here down, well including your mouth, I guess.
[time=1843] Everything else is responsive to that. It follows that direction. It follows that impulse of the head.
[time=1850] And so what the Apostle Paul says to us is it's not just important for the sake of the church that the church be equipped for ministry, that we be set straight so we can be useful.
[time=1861] We in fact are the vehicle, the expression of Christ's desires.
[time=1872] I'll never forget the first time I was really up close and personal with a physically handicapped person.
[time=1878] Seven or eight years ago I was asked to speak at a function for the physically handicapped.
[time=1884] And it was great to see the workers coming and they'd bring these people in and wheelchairs and their bodies and limbs were disfigured and you know how their legs are crumpled and just all that stuff that is a result of the fall.
[time=1897] And yet God loves and cares and they're of value. We don't mean to say that, but it's not certainly the way God intended it in the Garden of Eden.
[time=1905] And after my, it was a music program that I was to speak and then they were going to have some refreshments and after I spoke I noticed that over the table there was, they were short a worker.
[time=1913] Somebody didn't come and serve that day, didn't use their gifts to serve and so I thought maybe I could help out.
[time=1920] So I went over that table with fear and trembling not really knowing what to do and it was donuts, donuts were the refreshment and little something to drink.
[time=1927] And here was this wonderful young man about 25 years of age who knew exactly what he wanted to do. He wanted to eat that donut.
[time=1935] The problem was there wasn't a good connection between the head and the body and so he had no ability to get that thing in his mouth.
[time=1942] And so as I looked around the room and watched what everybody else was doing I broke off an appropriate size and lifted it up to his mouth and then I found out that his mouth didn't work well and his tongue didn't work well.
[time=1953] And so it became very, very messy as we tried to work together to accomplish this objective of giving him something as simple as a donut.
[time=1963] Then I'll be honest with you, there was because of my naivety in that area and because of the growth that needed to occur, there was a sense of whoa, this is really hard.
[time=1972] This is almost borderline repulsive and that was a statement about me, not him, see.
[time=1979] But we worked our way through that. Do you realize that when you and I are not properly trained and equipped to do the work of the ministry, both within this church and outside the doors of this church?
[time=2000] We have a head named Jesus who has desires, he is clear in his thinking, he is accurate, he is wise, he is knowledgeable, he knows what he wants to do but he does not have a body to get it done.
[time=2014] And there are things that get left undone for lack of training and for lack of involvement.
[time=2025] And then you can think on the other side of the spectrum, not a person who is physically handicapped but think of those who are physically gifted.
[time=2031] Think of a person like Dwight Stone and the Fosbury Flop, I mean what in the world, whoever thought of that, a guy I guess named Fosbury.
[time=2041] I mean how do you get your body above a pole that is six, seven, eight, ten inches above your own height?
[time=2048] And we've watched them on television and we've seen them take this little prance and then they come to the spot and they lift off and they go over backwards and everything just arches at the perfect moment until the feet kick at the end.
[time=2060] And there they've done it and it does not happen without the absolute coordination of every member of that body.
[time=2068] And when it's all in line and it's all in sync and it's all happening, this phenomenon occurs and people go my lands.
[time=2076] And I guess what Paul is driving at is here, he's saying hey guys, what kind of a body are you to the person of Jesus Christ?
[time=2085] Are you making him into a spastic?
[time=2088] Who is deformed and limited and unable to do some of the most basic things?
[time=2096] Or are we so committed and so trained and so committed to being retrained and so committed to advancing in the things of God
[time=2104] that we really make him, and I say this carefully, that we really make him able of expressions which are in the physical dimension comparable to an Olympic athlete.
[time=2115] I feel him really pulling at the strings of our hearts here and you're saying man I'd like to do that but you don't understand.
[time=2124] There's nothing in me, I mean you're talking to the wrong person here, I don't have anything like that to contribute.
[time=2130] Nothing in my life is that way, I mean not just my ministry at the church, you got to understand, I don't do anything well.
[time=2136] I don't do much of anything well at all, I don't have those abilities.
[time=2141] Would you hold your finger in Ephesians for just a minute and come with me to 1 Corinthians 12?
[time=2146] There's a passage over there that talks about you and about your abilities and what you really can do and what you really can't do and how you can be involved.
[time=2157] In 1 Corinthians 12, there's a discussion of spiritual gifts.
[time=2162] Now we're going to just kind of touch and go here in a few thoughts.
[time=2166] Verse 4, 1 Corinthians 12, 4, there are a variety, varieties of gifts but the same spirit.
[time=2174] Now when you see gifts, don't be confused, alright?
[time=2177] A lot of times you talk about a person's giftedness and there's somebody in your math class and they never study and they never work but they always get straight A's and you go gifted, I hate them, right?
[time=2186] There's people like Scott who never seems to practice, never seems to need his music, never seems to even look at the dog on keys and it always comes out right and you say gifted, I hate him too.
[time=2197] There are some people that you raced when you were a kid and everybody said go and everybody had a fair start but when it was over you were 20 yards behind and you pointed him and you go gifted, I hate you too.
[time=2207] I mean those are called talents, alright? Talents, just raw basic talents that come with your genetic makeup and you can enhance on those with hard work but there is this basic thing called human talent and that's not what this is talking about.
[time=2224] That is not what this passage is talking about.
[time=2227] God gave you those talents and those aren't to be spurned but this is talking about spiritual giftedness.
[time=2235] It's talking about a supernatural capacity to minister to other people and the truth is my friend, when you are born physically you are given your human talents, your natural talents, do with them what you will.
[time=2247] When you are born again, when you come to Christ and there is a regenerative experience in your life, that is when God gives you these gifts in verse 4.
[time=2256] These are supernatural capacities for ministry that are given to you by the Spirit of God. Notice verse 5 and there are varieties of ministries and the same Lord.
[time=2268] By varieties of ministries we are talking about diversity inside the body and you think about the body and how much trouble it would be if the whole thing was nothing but a leg or nothing but a finger or nothing but a hand.
[time=2279] It wouldn't work. It would be useless. It couldn't accomplish. So God when He gifts you and I mean you when He gifts you, He gives you a variety of gifts.
[time=2290] Some of us have helping and serving and exhortation and teaching and administration and leadership and there is a whole list of them and they are not exhaustive.
[time=2298] There are other ones even that are listed here in the New Testament we believe. Just an open-ended list.
[time=2303] And God gives you a unique package of gifts so that you can fit the right place in His body here at Blackhawk.
[time=2318] Well, and by the way notice in verse 5 it says varieties there is the diversity of ministries and that word is to serve. That's deaconos. That means to serve. In other words these gifts are not badges.
[time=2330] These gifts are not little things you wear on your chest to say see how God has gifted me. These are ministries of service. God wants to give you varieties and diversity in the way that you can serve the body of Christ.
[time=2345] And say okay I get it. At salvation I get spiritual gifts. They are supernatural. They are supposed to be able to help me do ministry. But you can understand something. I won't be able to use that right. I mean it won't come out right.
[time=2356] It's like somebody gives you a brand new golf club. Best one out ever made like the famous super duper golf club they give it to you.
[time=2363] And you say see now I got the best golf club in the world but the problem is I'm still holding it. I mean I'm still the one who has to swing it and so it doesn't do much better than my other golf club.
[time=2371] And you're saying so what? God gave me a whole bunch of gifts but it's still me my friend and I'm not very good and it's not going to come out so hot.
[time=2379] Well see but it's different in this category as well. Look at verse 6. This is amazing. It says and there are a variety of effects.
[time=2390] It could have been translated energy but the same God who works all things in all persons do you realize that he not only gives you the gift he not only gives you a variety of gifts so you can be involved in ministry of the body but he produces.
[time=2404] It is his energy that runs through the gift that produces his desired effect. You are guaranteed of success is what this is saying.
[time=2414] No you may not be Billy Graham because he may not have gifted you like that. You may not be Chuck Swindall because he may not have gifted you like that.
[time=2421] You may not be as gifted as another person but at the level that God has given you to minister he promises to energize it and make it effective for his own glory and for his own sake.
[time=2431] So the whole thing is his. He redeems you. He gives you the gift. He places you in ministry. He energizes it so he can get the glory.
[time=2438] It just leaves like two things for us. A) Are you willing to know what your gifts are and be trained in how to use them?
[time=2446] And two) Are you willing to use them? I mean he kind of knew what he was working with like frail clay and so he didn't leave a lot up to us.
[time=2453] He said just know what they are and use them. Will you? I'll take care of everything else.
[time=2459] I believe with all my heart you know he didn't have to do it this way. He could have structured it differently.
[time=2466] But do you realize this lets us in on the greatest concern going on the planet?
[time=2471] Because he chose to structure it this way you and I get a sense of belonging. We get a sense of God has used me today.
[time=2478] We get a sense of I make a difference and I make a difference in a cause that's bigger than the local YMCA.
[time=2485] I get to make a difference in the cause of winning people and training people for the glory of God.
[time=2491] And without me you can't do it as good. What a great feeling.
[time=2495] It's the opposite of standing there waiting to get picked in grammar school to play on the kickball team and being the last person picked.
[time=2501] Because we had to pick everybody. They would rather have sent you away but they had to pick you so they picked you and then they stuck you in the right field.
[time=2508] Like hoping the ball would never come to you. God is coming to you and he's saying I pick you and I pick you and I pick you and I pick you.
[time=2516] Because we got a team here and without you our team won't win. Our team won't be as effective. We simply can't pull it off without you.
[time=2525] One of the greatest satisfactions as I talk to Christians in their Christian life. One of the greatest satisfactions that they experience is this sense of being used by God to serve other people and looking back at it in 2020 and saying God used me.
[time=2545] And if you're not in that position, if you're not able to have those kinds of experiences you're just missing a big piece of the pie.
[time=2554] Let's go back to Ephesians and finish this thing up.
[time=2559] So he gives us this kind of a concept. Man you're the body. Christ is the head. Let's be coordinated. Let's be dedicated.
[time=2569] Let's be refined. Let's be doing this in ways that bring honor to his name.
[time=2576] So the pattern and the picture and now finally the program. You say program.
[time=2588] Where's the word program show up in the Bible? I didn't know the Bible gave programs. Well it doesn't. But look at verse 16 for a minute.
[time=2596] He got Christ as the head. Now watch what happens. Verse 16.
[time=2612] What does that mean? What does it mean? We're fitted and held together by that which every joint supplies. He's carrying on the body metaphor, right?
[time=2620] And now he's not talking about parts, he's talking about the joints that hold the parts together.
[time=2626] Well what is that in the Christian community? What is it that holds one person to another person?
[time=2631] What is it that holds us together like a joint? A joint is nothing. It's space. It's air and the physical body.
[time=2638] There are two bones that come together. It's ligaments and tendons that hold and are elastic and stretch and allow that thing to do what it's supposed to do.
[time=2646] I think that's talking about relationships. The strength of the body, you are held together to me so that we can do the work by not by ligaments, not by tendons, but by the strength of our relationships together.
[time=2662] Well guess what a program is? A program is nothing more than putting the right people next to the right people so that the right things can happen.
[time=2672] A program is nothing more than getting you next to somebody else who can teach you and train you how to use your spiritual gifts in an effective manner.
[time=2679] That's all program is. Program is nothing more than an organization, an organized way to put the right people together with the right people to get the right job done.
[time=2687] So really that is the program, it's relationships.
[time=2691] Let's talk about a few of them that could happen here at Blackhawk. Let's talk about Vision 2002. How do we want to equip people in Vision 2002?
[time=2699] Let's start with the topic of the day, spiritual gifts. Do you realize that I could stand up here for four weeks in a row and teach on the major passages in the New Testament about the gifts of the Holy Spirit?
[time=2711] And let's say I do a B+ job on this thing.
[time=2716] Now guess what? We all know, many of you have already been taught, some of you haven't, we all know now about spiritual gifts, don't we?
[time=2724] And if that's where it stops, what have we done? We've informed some people about some biblical data.
[time=2730] But here's what we don't know, you don't know what yours are.
[time=2734] Because we can't take time in a service like this and find out what your gifts are.
[time=2738] Worse, we haven't gotten you to a place where you can use your gifts.
[time=2743] We haven't networked you to a ministry that suits your personal passion for ministry and your gifts and your relating style so that you can actually give yourself and go home from church saying, man, it feels good to be used by God.
[time=2757] So we want to start a series of what we call life skills seminars. Life skills seminars. One of them would be about your spiritual giftedness.
[time=2767] We'd love to be able to open up a little curriculum, maybe for 12 weeks where you could sign up to go to this thing and you'd not only learn all about spiritual gifts, but you'd learn what your spiritual gifts are.
[time=2778] And then you'd learn about how you could be used in which ministry in this church to serve.
[time=2785] And we plug you in and then in three or six months we'd follow up on you and find out how you're doing it.
[time=2789] Was it a good experience? Because so often it's backwards in the church.
[time=2793] We have an urgent need for some warm body in the spot so we just grab anybody and we stick them in there.
[time=2798] It may have nothing to do with the way that God has designed them. It may have nothing to do with their gift package.
[time=2802] And so they gut it out until when? June, right? That's what everybody guts it out to.
[time=2808] All the way to June and then when June comes we resign from that ministry because it's summertime quote unquote and then we just never sign up for another ministry again.
[time=2816] I don't think it has to be that way in the church. I don't think it should be that way in the church.
[time=2819] Using your gifts and ministering your talents for God should be the most exciting thing going.
[time=2825] But it may take a little bit of structure and programmatic help to help people learn them and use them effectively.
[time=2832] And if it doesn't work after six months know there's help to get you in another ministry that might be you that would really reflect your passion and your talents and your gifts.
[time=2842] How about another one that I get really excited about?
[time=2847] Growing kids God's way.
[time=2850] Do you realize that we do not have one ministry in our whole church right now?
[time=2855] There's a one ministry in our whole church where you as a parent can be taught how to raise your kids.
[time=2866] Now we've got some stuff for the high school parents, but frankly if you don't have your kid by the time he's in high school you may never get him.
[time=2873] You may be damaged control. That may be how to mitigate some of the things that are now going wrong.
[time=2878] But how about when the kid is zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[time=2882] You know there was a day in our country when you didn't need that kind of training maybe because all you had to do was look at your mom and dad and how they did it.
[time=2888] And most people had mom and dads that were together and most people had mom and dads that had basic moral absolutes
[time=2894] and there wasn't a need for a lot of training you just kind of did it like it got done to you and things work out.
[time=2898] That certainly has changed. That has changed remarkably.
[time=2902] And now you look back at your mom and dad and you see a dysfunctional relationship. Maybe there's divorce.
[time=2906] There's a lot of things that never should have gone on there and you end up handing to your children what was wrong even about the past.
[time=2914] Or you don't hand them enough because you never saw it. Nobody ever trained you. Nobody showed you. Nobody taught you.
[time=2919] We've got a program going right now. Growing kids God's way. It's a little pilot program with one instructor and a few couples.
[time=2925] And I'm so excited about it. I check in with those couples and hear how it's going.
[time=2929] One of the couples has about a three year old child and just had a newborn that we dedicated and baby dedication to their night and I talked to them that night and they said you can't believe how excited we are about this.
[time=2939] It's so wonderful to be able to understand God's truth specifically about marriage and, excuse me, about raising our kids and be able to ask our questions.
[time=2949] I mean our personal questions about what to do when and what to do next and how to do this and how to do that.
[time=2954] We are just learning so much and we're so excited about it, they said to me.
[time=2959] There's another couple in there which would be the kinds of couples that probably will fill this stuff in the future.
[time=2965] At least a percentage of it. She has been married before, has a daughter.
[time=2972] She is now with, you know, there's another dad in the picture and he's got his background and she's got hers and this child and all the confusion.
[time=2983] And it's the greatest joy in their life to know that there's a way for them to look through the principles of parenting in a concise way and throw out the junk and find the stuff to have real unity around and be able to present a wholesome, godly family for this dear little child that they've got.
[time=3000] Where do they get that if they don't get it here?
[time=3002] Where do they find that kind of help if they don't find it here?
[time=3005] How do we build strong families if we don't isolate this kind of an issue and begin to teach people how to do that?
[time=3010] Oh yeah, I could do a series on parenting and there's passages, Ephesians 6, for example, I could preach through that and I'd do my best and it would be helpful and it would be kind of a theological network for the family.
[time=3021] But what about the nitty-gritty life-on-life specific stuff that I need to get my family to work well?
[time=3028] It just astounds me. It astounds us as an elder board and staff.
[time=3032] As we realize, you realize there is no program, there is no staff money, there is no time set aside, there is no curriculum, there is no intentional effort that we can open our arms to families.
[time=3046] Those who are already saved and in the church a number of years and those who might come to where they can say, would you teach me how to raise my kids?
[time=3053] What does the Bible say about that?
[time=3055] I don't know, are you picking up my osmosis, I guess? I think we can do better than that. I think we must do better than that.
[time=3065] I think the potentials are astounding to open that kind of training up for our people so that the bones can be properly set so that the part of the body can work effectively.
[time=3078] Well, there are others that we could share, there are ten of them in your list. One of them is a thing called legacy.
[time=3085] We use the word legacy to hand the great spiritual deposit to the next generation and there is a ministry going on that we need staff to continue to do properly where our elders can be training up deacons and deacons in training or men who would be interested in becoming deacons.
[time=3099] There is no path for that right now in our church, there is no real way to make sure your doctrine is sound and to make sure your family is whole and to make sure that your life is in order so that when you get into it,
[time=3107] when you get nominated for a deacon or an elder, you can say, "Yeah, you know I've been trained, I understand what that ministry is about, I feel qualified and I want to serve.
[time=3116] Why not? Why doesn't that ministry exist? I don't understand that, it just seems so essential." There is another ministry that I was just talking with someone about this morning before the service started and he is leading this for us and it's to train teachers for ABF sonar in our whole church.
[time=3132] Before you just kind of, somebody just kind of said, "Well, I bet you'd be a good teacher." And the guy said, "Well, maybe I taught a Sunday school class before for kids, I'll give it a shot."
[time=3140] I mean, how did, now there is a ministry where we can start marching guys through who have a prompting from God to want to be good Bible teachers and we can teach them their doctrine and we can look at their life and we can give them practical skills on how to teach and give them some preliminary experimental, you know, shots at teaching in friendly environments
[time=3159] and refine that skill and some will probably weed it out and others will really distinguish themselves as strong teachers and will have a whole platoon of men that are ready to continue to teach and instruct in the things of God.
[time=3170] The potentials are huge. We could have a life skills seminar on your personal finances and many people in our church, their personal finances are way off base.
[time=3181] Where else should you go than your own local church to learn God? You know, the Bible says so much about money.
[time=3187] In practical terms, how do I run my budget? Please teach me this. Well, the list goes on.
[time=3193] And the longer you talk about the listening more exciting it gets because the possibilities are just so enormous.
[time=3200] Well, let me close with this. We're talking about vision 2002.
[time=3204] What is a vision? What is a vision? Okay, do me a favor. Just close your eyes. I promise I won't throw anything at you.
[time=3214] Just close your eyes for a minute. Now, I want you to see what I'm describing, you and your family, and if you're single, you and some friends in Hawaii.
[time=3224] You got it? You see that big gorgeous hotel? You see those palm trees? You see that gorgeous water? You see your kids running around?
[time=3233] Okay, open your eyes. That's a vision. A vision is nothing more than a preferred future.
[time=3240] And if you don't think that's a better way to spend next week than what you had in mind before you came, something's wrong with you.
[time=3245] It's a preferred future. That's all a vision is. It's just seeing a preferred future.
[time=3251] And all we're saying in vision 2002 is let's close our eyes for a minute as a church and let's look to tomorrow.
[time=3257] And what are we seeing? We're seeing a renewed commitment to evangelism, building relationships with unbelievers, sharing our faith and inviting them to outreach services.
[time=3266] And we're seeing hundreds of people come to Christ because we've recommitted ourselves to that task.
[time=3273] And with our eyes, our spiritual eyes still closed just for a moment.
[time=3277] We're seeing those people in desperate need of edification to be built up, to be held accountable, to be supported through the hardship of their life,
[time=3285] and be able to ask and answer the hard questions in their life about what really matters.
[time=3290] And we're seeing then, therefore, a strengthened ABF ministry and small groups forming all over our church.
[time=3297] We're on a weekly basis. People come together and ask those kinds of issues and pray together and meet intimately for the building up of one another.
[time=3304] And as we close our eyes again under equipping, we're just seeing life, skills, seminars properly staffed and properly administrative where you can come and get scratched where you're itching in your spiritual need.
[time=3316] Then I wish I knew how to raise my kids better. Man, I wish I knew how to run my finances better.
[time=3321] But I wish I knew how to reach out to my unsaved person better.
[time=3324] And so we're just seeing hundreds of us moving into these training seminars and learning how to do this and applying it to our lives.
[time=3332] Man, it's almost like going to Hawaii, you know?
[time=3336] I mean, what a vision. What an exciting thing to be a part of.
[time=3340] Winning people to Christ, building them up and training them ultimately to do what?
[time=3345] To win other people to Christ for the cause.
[time=3349] Well, thank you.
[time=3351] Ephesians 4 lays down the pattern, the picture, and the program for us.
[time=3355] All we've got to do is go get it. Let's pray together.
[time=3362] [MUSIC]
[time=3372] Well, it's a tremendous thing that God is choosing to use people to advance his kingdom that we can be equipped for his service.
[time=3379] And maybe you're watching this today and you want to be a part of that whole program.
[time=3384] You want to be used. You want to have a sense of making a difference in what God is doing in people's lives today.
[time=3390] And it needs to start in your own life.
[time=3392] You know that you're not saved. You know you've never been born again.
[time=3395] You know there's a sense of alienation between you and God because your sin has never been dealt with.
[time=3400] And you'd like to, even right now, be made right with God through Jesus Christ.
[time=3405] If that's all at all working in your heart today, let me invite you to bow your head and pray this simple prayer with me and invite Christ to be your Savior.
[time=3414] Father, I know that I am a sinner. I know that I have violated your holy law.
[time=3419] I know that I am at war with you because of my sin. I deserve your punishment, your wrath and hell forever and ever.
[time=3427] But I believe in the person of Jesus Christ that He died on the cross for my sins to make a way of forgiveness for my sins.
[time=3435] I put my trust completely and totally in Him.
[time=3438] I ask Him to come into my heart to be my Savior.
[time=3441] I commit my life to serving you through the power of Jesus Christ and pray these things in Jesus' name.
[time=3448] [AMEN] Well, if you prayed to receive that prayer, we'd love to know about it.
[time=3453] Write us and let us know about that.
