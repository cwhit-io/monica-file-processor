[time=0] So I thought what I would do is I'm going to talk on worship and just boil the thing down
[time=6] to a basic definition, a two-word definition, and we'll spend our entire time this morning around these two words that I think define worship for us in a meaningful way.
[time=15] And here they are.
[time=17] Two words.
[time=18] Heart felt, sacrifice.
[time=21] Worship is a heartfelt sacrifice.
[time=31] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship service of the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=35] We're so glad you've joined us today.
[time=38] For the past several weeks, Pastor Russell Moore has been challenging us with Vision 2002.
[time=44] Just a moment he'll conclude this series with a message about exalting, but right now let's begin with a sanctuary choir singing "The Music of Your Praise."
[time=78] [MUSIC - 132 seconds]
[time=233] [APPLAUSE]
[time=238] How long has it been since you've had a good hard laugh?
[time=241] The stress of life got you down.
[time=243] If that describes you or someone you know, why not write for the free book The Bible Hour is giving away to all who write.
[time=250] It's called Fun is Contagious, How to Help Your Family Lighten Up by Chuck Swindall.
[time=256] We'd be very happy to send you a free copy.
[time=260] Our address is the Bible Hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=266] Please drop us a note today, won't you?
[time=268] Now let's return to our Sunday morning service.
[time=270] [MUSIC]
[time=282] Some trust in chariots, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, some trust in horses, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, his love never fails, his name will always prevail.
[time=309] We trust in the name of the Lord our God, some trust in the work they do, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, because by his work all the grace is through, we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[time=328] We trust in the name of the Lord our God, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, his love never fails, his name will always prevail, we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[time=349] All glory to the name, the name of our salvation, all glory to the name of all names, the name of the Lord our God, some trust in the wealth of men, we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[time=377] The name worth more than anything, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, his love never fails, his name will always prevail, we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[time=403] We trust in the name of the Lord our God, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, his love never fails, his name will always prevail, we trust in the name of the Lord our God.
[time=432] The name, we trust in the name of the Lord our God, we trust in the name of God.
[time=461] We trust, we trust, we trust, we trust in the name of God, the name of God.
[time=480] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=484] Well just a few things to keep you informed on upcoming events, we're looking forward to having the Promise Keepers Leadership Conference here at Black Hawk Baptist Church October 28 and 29.
[time=495] You can still register for this wonderful event, there should be a number on the screen, we invite you to call that and don't miss this opportunity, it's not really for leaders in the sense that you have to be a church pastor or elder or deacon to be a part of it, it's just a statement that you want to be a leader in your church as a lay person
[time=510] and you want to help give direction and focus and energy to the life of your church.
[time=515] So I encourage you to be a part of this great movement of God, the Lord is using Promise Keepers in such a wonderful way and there's just a true spirit of God about it and a momentum and I'd hate to see you miss out on this.
[time=526] And maybe to this point you felt a little bit on the outside, maybe you've heard some people talk about it and they're experienced down in Annapolis or they've gone to some planning meeting or they're doing this or doing that.
[time=537] And you're wondering can you fit and is it too late for you to be a part, just jump in, you'll be amazed at how quickly you'll be assimilated and welcomed in this wonderful group and how much your life will truly be challenged through this Promise Keepers Leadership Conference.
[time=553] Also, I want to ask all of you to be in prayer for our living Christmas tree, we're so excited about being able to host this event for our community, again this Christmas season.
[time=563] I was just checking with one of our men who work in the living Christmas tree and there's only 48 more days until our first public performance of the living Christmas tree and that's just coming so fast and there's so much to be done.
[time=576] And that's why I'm asking you to pray, I would just be forever grateful if you'd set it aside on a daily basis or write it down on a piece of paper and stick it in your car there on your steering wheel so you're reminded just from time to time to offer a prayer that God would bless those who are ministering to put the tree on.
[time=594] We'll have over 400 to 500 volunteers at a Black Hawk Baptist Church putting this event on as we do every year and each one of them is vital and each one of them has a part to play and each one of them is facing the same kind of obstacles that you and I face, just getting enough time to do the volunteer stuff.
[time=610] And so if you just pray for them and that God would keep them safe and keep them faithful and keep them motivated to do the job, and then also be in prayer that as the gospel is presented this year, that the Lord would take it.
[time=623] And use it in a mighty, in a powerful way, that He'd penetrate the hearts of those who are there who don't know Christ, that they'd see Him, understand Him maybe for the very first time and accept Him as their Lord and Savior.
[time=635] And that way you can be a part of what we're doing here through the living Christmas tree and we give God the glory for that.
[time=642] Well today we have the last in our series on Vision 2002, a series about the vision of Black Hawk Baptist Church, and I trust that as you've listened to some of the things we're hoping God will do in our church in the days to come, that it's excited you about your church and about what God can do through your church.
[time=659] And I just want to be an encourager to you, if you're a part of a local church, to support your pastor, to pray for Him, to listen carefully to the direction of the leadership in your church, to be willing to be flexible if they have changes that they want to make or if they have an area of emphasis they'd like to give.
[time=675] You know, jump in behind that, be a part of the group that's saying we're excited about what God can do.
[time=681] If you're watching today and you don't have a church and you've never really been a part of a church or maybe you've fallen away from a church and you feel alienated from the people of God.
[time=692] If you don't have a church I want to invite you to come by and visit Black Hawk and make Black Hawk your home.
[time=697] We have a great number of people here who love God and who'd open their arms to you and you can find a place of encouragement and ministry.
[time=704] Don't stand alone in your Christian faith, make sure you're a part of the community of God.
[time=709] Well, at this time we'll go back to our service and trust you'll enjoy the preaching of God's Word.
[time=739] Enter the night, the rest of my life.
[time=747] Here am I, here am I.
[time=755] Just a single voice to lift your name on high.
[time=763] Though I'm serving you in my own left, the perfect way.
[time=771] You love me even still and in return you say, here am I.
[time=783] Welling into action, taken by extremes, touch and go attraction.
[time=794] Yet this is where it seems that I am meant to be, all through the day.
[time=804] Enter the night, the rest of my life.
[time=813] Here am I, here am I.
[time=821] Just a single voice to lift your name on high.
[time=829] Though I'm serving you in my own left, the perfect way.
[time=837] You love me even still and in return you say, here am I.
[time=862] Waiting on your ranster, where ever would I pray, that now I can hear you say, here am I, here am I.
[time=885] And the voice of many angels fills the sky.
[time=893] Loving me in your own or so perfect way.
[time=900] And all you ask of me is that I'm going to say, here am I.
[time=911] Here am I, here am I, here am I.
[time=963] Thank you Michelle, tremendous little phrase, here am I, out of Isaiah 6.
[time=969] This is a statement of willingness to serve God.
[time=972] Well we come today to our last message in our series on Vision 2002 and it brings us to the 4th E.
[time=978] We've called it Exalting, which is just a line the 4 E's up together.
[time=982] The real theme is worship or exalting or celebration.
[time=985] And to be honest with you, I don't think that I have ever preached a clear, concise, helpful message on worship.
[time=993] As I was looking past, or looking over some messages in the past over the last maybe 8 or 9 years, I've probably spoken 5 times on worship itself.
[time=1002] As I read those sermons, I just came away with the feeling that they were vague, that they were unclear, they were a little ethereal.
[time=1010] It kind of gave me the impression of like a helium balloon that you get for your kid, which is a really nice thing to get your kid, but you know it can get away from you.
[time=1017] And pretty soon it's up in the clouds and it's gone and you got to get a hold on it thing.
[time=1021] So I think worship is a topic that goes up and it has a tendency and there are components to it that force us to think about properly impacting God, which is kind of a spiritual thing.
[time=1034] But I've come today with a commitment in my heart to keep a little string on this balloon and have a tight grip on it so it doesn't get away from us.
[time=1041] And my hope is that you'll go away today with a real understanding of what worship is and what you can do about it.
[time=1048] So I want to just give you a statement about worship.
[time=1053] I want to preach this whole message about two words.
[time=1056] Two words, worship is, and here it is, heartfelt sacrifice.
[time=1061] Worship is heartfelt sacrifice.
[time=1064] This whole message is going to be about those two words.
[time=1067] What does that mean and how do I express it and why should I give it?
[time=1070] Heart felt sacrifice.
[time=1072] So we'll define what it is and then I'll try to explain why we should have a heartfelt sense towards God that would promote real worship.
[time=1080] And then last I'll give you how can I sacrifice in this day and age without goats and rams and bulls and pigeons and all that stuff.
[time=1087] How do I do that?
[time=1088] So first the definition, heartfelt sacrifice.
[time=1092] By heartfelt I mean this.
[time=1094] It doesn't just mean emotions.
[time=1096] It doesn't mean spiritual goosebumps.
[time=1098] By heartfelt it is an earnest, genuine movement of your heart.
[time=1104] It is not contrived.
[time=1106] It comes from within you. It is not external. It is not ritual.
[time=1110] It is not routine.
[time=1112] It has nothing to do with going through the motions.
[time=1114] By heartfelt we mean something stirs within you at a heart level.
[time=1119] By sacrifice we mean this.
[time=1121] Whatever it is you're worshiping you're willing to pay a price for it.
[time=1125] It has become a priority.
[time=1127] You are willing to give things up for it.
[time=1130] Does it feel like the balloons kind of go into the top?
[time=1133] Okay let me give you two pictures. Two common, average, ordinary, everyday life pictures of heartfelt sacrifice that I think will bring the thing into focus.
[time=1142] The first one.
[time=1143] Let's take a girl 16, 17, 18 years of age who falls in love for the very first time.
[time=1151] And I have seen a lot of this because I am the youngest child in a family with three older sisters and then me.
[time=1158] And so I kind of watched my sisters do this weird thing of falling in love.
[time=1162] And one day they were normal and the next day they were weird.
[time=1165] It happened just that easily.
[time=1167] Now the one I saw most closely was the sister right above me, her name is Cheryl.
[time=1170] And she happened to have fallen in love with a guy named Alan when she was 14.
[time=1174] It's the only guy she's ever dated.
[time=1177] It's the only guy she's ever done anything with.
[time=1179] And she's still with him today. They got married and they have four kids.
[time=1183] Classic example of girl falling head over heels with a boy.
[time=1188] Heart felt absolutely no question about it.
[time=1192] There was nothing in Cheryl's commitment to Alan that had to do with an external ritual.
[time=1197] Something she had to show up to do, something she had to be reminded to do, something she had to be forced to do.
[time=1202] There wasn't once where we felt she wasn't doing enough of it.
[time=1206] You know, it's like you're just kind of fulfilling the bare minimum here, Cheryl.
[time=1210] Could you pick it up a few notches?
[time=1211] No, it was always pedal to the metal, absolute max.
[time=1214] She was smitten with this guy.
[time=1216] She was starry eyed. She was head over heels.
[time=1219] She was sick.
[time=1221] Right? She was love sick.
[time=1223] And it came from her heart.
[time=1226] I remember as we, my dad and I would kind of look at each other at particular moments.
[time=1229] We'd kind of give that glance like, "Oh, my lance. Has it gone that far?" And it'd be like we could say to each other, "She worships him." Yeah, that makes sense, doesn't it?
[time=1241] She worships him.
[time=1243] So it came from deep within her heart.
[time=1246] It was sacrificial.
[time=1250] All of the other interests in her life suddenly took a back seat.
[time=1254] Very talented tennis player, very fast runner, very accomplished volleyball player.
[time=1259] Suddenly, all those sports were in the back seat.
[time=1262] And she stayed with them, but when she was at them, she was waiting for them to get over so she could be with him.
[time=1269] All of her friends, all of the girlfriends that she had grown up with and spent a lot of time was suddenly faded out of the picture.
[time=1275] And there were no more phone calls.
[time=1276] And there were no more movies.
[time=1277] And there were no more camping trips.
[time=1278] And there were no more excursions of the beach with her girlfriends.
[time=1281] That was over.
[time=1283] The only time she was with them was when she was talking about him.
[time=1287] You understand?
[time=1289] They became incidental.
[time=1290] They became props.
[time=1291] They became supports against which this main feature, Alan, had taken center stage.
[time=1296] School work became a real problem for her.
[time=1298] In fact, there were times when my parents had to give external pressure to make sure that her being so swept off her feet with Alan didn't keep her from maintaining at least some decent grades.
[time=1308] And then, of course, her little brother, I got left completely out of the picture.
[time=1313] As soon as he comes in, no more bike rides, no more swimming in the pool, no more playing games.
[time=1318] I was just like this nothing in the house that was in the way.
[time=1322] And would you get out of this room so I can talk to him on the phone, or would you leave us alone?
[time=1327] Until she found out that her parents would not let her date until she was 16.
[time=1331] But if I was along, they could go to dinner, and they could go to movies together, and they could go do things.
[time=1339] And so I suddenly was swept into the center of her life because I was the only avenue to spending time with Alan.
[time=1348] Enormous sacrifices.
[time=1350] She started to give herself to him her time.
[time=1353] Enormous, every waking moment that she could give to him, she gave to him gifts.
[time=1357] Money that she'd saved in her bank account suddenly became available, very liquid, so she could run and buy all these thoughtful, expensive, like meaningful gifts that she just had to give to him.
[time=1369] The attention of her life.
[time=1372] And eventually, all of her plans for her future came in line with him.
[time=1377] She used to have other dreams. She was going to be a court reporter, she was going to be this, she was going to be that.
[time=1382] Then she met Alan, and over time, there was just this one thing that she was going to be, his wife, his lover, his friend, his partner.
[time=1392] Now that gets worship down here, doesn't it? That's where the cookies can be grabbed the hold of.
[time=1397] We understand that, we have seen that. That is heartfelt sacrifice.
[time=1403] And the exciting thing that I like about this picture is that she was so overcome from her heart with Alan that though she was making enormous sacrifices to be with him, they never felt like sacrifices to her.
[time=1418] That may be a beautiful aspect of worship.
[time=1421] In fact, I am making great sacrifices, but I am so enamored they hardly feel like it.
[time=1427] I could hardly envision another way to live my life.
[time=1431] The second picture that comes to my mind is of a boy and his ball.
[time=1435] A boy and his ball. And I don't know what kind of ball, maybe it's a basketball, maybe it's a football, maybe it's a golf ball.
[time=1441] I don't know, maybe it isn't a ball, maybe it's swimming, maybe it's track.
[time=1445] But there is a point in time where this little 15 or 16 month old kid sees it and goes ugh.
[time=1453] And that's it. The love affair has begun.
[time=1457] And it becomes the heartfelt passion of his life. It's all that he thinks about.
[time=1462] It's all that he wants to do. He is possessed with it, right? That's what happens.
[time=1467] You feel as if he's been possessed by the demon of basketball and it now has control of his life.
[time=1474] You have to drag him off the court or drag him off the field or drag him away from the TV where CNN is giving the latest reports and get him in the bed.
[time=1483] Because it is the compulsion of his life.
[time=1487] You don't have to say and fan the flames in his heart. You ought to be playing more basketball.
[time=1491] He just ignites on the stuff. It's not a requirement. There are no legalistic rituals involved.
[time=1497] There is no external stuff. It just comes right from his heart.
[time=1501] It's heartfelt engagement with that particular sport.
[time=1506] Sacrifices? You bet. It takes priority in his life. His friends become only the friends that play that same sport.
[time=1513] And if you don't play that same sport, well, we're friends, but we're not really friends because I spend all my time in this sport.
[time=1518] And if you want to know me, know me in this sport.
[time=1520] His casual time becomes as he grows and finds that he may have some ability and that he can train and with dedication, he can find new levels of competence and competition.
[time=1530] Suddenly the way he eats, the time he sleeps, what he drinks, how he spends summer vacations, where he goes to school.
[time=1537] If in fact he could get a scholarship, all of his life direction becomes focused on the ball.
[time=1544] And sacrifices are being made at every turn of the road so that he can find the full expression of his heart's desire.
[time=1551] And what I like about this particular picture of a heartfelt sacrifice is that it displays a willingness to be disciplined.
[time=1559] To discipline every area of life for love of the game.
[time=1565] And it speaks strongly to me about what God would have from us in worship.
[time=1574] So if that's what it is, if that's, I hope, a decent effort at getting the thing out of the clouds and saying,
[time=1582] would you just tell me in playing language, what is worship? Worship is heartfelt sacrifice.
[time=1590] As you can see it in the heart of a girl for a boy, as you can see it in the heart of a boy for his sport.
[time=1597] That is what God wants. That is the way God would have us about him.
[time=1602] That is the level at which God would have us enamored and therefore the kinds of dedication and sacrifice in our own spheres of influence.
[time=1611] That we would make.
[time=1616] Alright, so the next question. Why?
[time=1621] Why should I feel this way about God?
[time=1624] What is it about God that should capture my heart?
[time=1628] What is it about God that should give me this, be swept off my feet, head over heels, starry-eyed?
[time=1637] Well, there are four reasons I want to give you. There's probably as many reasons as there are infinite numbers because it's God we're dealing with.
[time=1644] But I've narrowed them down to four.
[time=1647] The first one is what we call his intrinsic worship.
[time=1651] Just who he is.
[time=1653] We ought to feel this way about him just because of who, not because of what he's done, just because of who he is.
[time=1659] In Isaiah 6, the song "Here I Am Lord" that Michelle sang, you got Isaiah in the temple of the Lord.
[time=1666] And he gets a vision of God, and he sees these angels, these seraphim, and they're singing this song.
[time=1672] And it's only a three-word song. It's holy, holy, holy, and they're just singing about what God is.
[time=1679] Holiness means that he is absolutely separate from sin, and Isaiah becomes so overwhelmed with just who God is that he falls on his face and worships.
[time=1690] God touches his lips with a call to purify his sinful, it's emblematic of being purified from your sin,
[time=1696] and then God says, "I need a preacher," and he says, "Here am I, sin me." There it is.
[time=1701] That's what it means to worship God because of who he is, because you're holy.
[time=1706] I'm so taken back and consumed by your holiness, I'll do anything.
[time=1710] Here am I, sin me. Does it feel like the balloons floating a little bit?
[time=1714] Well, think of it this way.
[time=1717] When girl meets boy, she becomes so enamored with who he is, right?
[time=1724] He doesn't even have to do anything.
[time=1727] It's just, I love the way he looks.
[time=1730] I love the way he combs his hair.
[time=1733] I notice the way he walks, he's slightly pigeon-toed, it just tries me nuts.
[time=1739] I love his car.
[time=1741] I love the way he dresses.
[time=1743] I love his personality.
[time=1745] I love his choice of words.
[time=1747] She just gets swept up into who he is, right?
[time=1753] That's what it means, the intrinsic worthiness of God.
[time=1758] You just fall in love with him, the fact that he is holy, that he is just, that he is all-powerful, that he is all-knowing, that he is righteous, that he is slow to anger, that he is unchanging, the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow you can count on him.
[time=1776] He won't change his colors suddenly in the middle of the night.
[time=1780] The fact that he is infinite and that you cannot understand him, that I cannot understand him, that the Bible does not fully explain him to us, like saying count to infinity and you say, "I can't, I don't even understand infinity." It is with God, I don't understand God, he's too big, he's too marvelous.
[time=1796] Just to be overwhelmed with who he is, his graciousness, that he is the kind of God that gives favors to those who do not deserve him, that he is merciful,
[time=1806] that he is loving, let yourself be smitten, let yourself be starry-eyed,
[time=1814] let yourself go head over heels over that kind of a God.
[time=1820] You'll find yourself making sacrifices for him that don't even feel like sacrifices.
[time=1827] The second reason that I've kind of identified as a reason to be heartfelt about God is because of his mighty deeds.
[time=1836] Not just who he is, because of what he's done.
[time=1840] It says in Nehemiah 9, 6, "Thou alone art the Lord.
[time=1845] Thou hast made the heavens and the heaven of the heavens.
[time=1850] The earth and all that is in it, the seas and all that is in them, thou dost give life to all them, thou art the Lord God." And Nehemiah is trying to get his mind around the fact that he worships a God who literally spoke all of creation, the earth, the heavens, the atmosphere,
[time=1869] the whole thing just spoke it into existence out of nothing.
[time=1873] They call that ex-nehelio from nothing, out of absolutely nothing.
[time=1877] God just said, "Let there be," and boom, there it was, in all of its magnitude, in all of its glory, in all of its genius, in all of its ability to keep itself alive and moving and running, which he then himself sustains.
[time=1889] Do you realize the mighty hand of God is the thing which gave you the breath you just took?
[time=1894] That is the sustaining work of God.
[time=1896] That is his mighty deed in your life to give you yet another breath and to allow that breath to have meaning to the biological processes of your physical body.
[time=1906] That air as it is composed makes sense to your lungs, and your lungs are able to break that down and feed it to the bloodstream, and your bloodstream is able to get it to your brain and other parts of your body so you don't die.
[time=1916] You know what? If God doesn't sustain that breath, you don't get it.
[time=1921] That is the active involvement of God in his creation.
[time=1925] The atom stays together because God holds it together.
[time=1931] Is the balloon going up a little bit? Just picture a little guy.
[time=1936] He's so excited about baseball, it's all he lives for.
[time=1939] It's all he plays. It's his only sport.
[time=1941] You go into his room, it's everywhere, posters and pictures and gloves and bats from every stadium in the world.
[time=1947] I mean, one of these all-out commitments to baseball can buy a twist of fate somehow, some way.
[time=1956] He and his dad are standing out in the backyard throwing the ball, and Babe Ruth shows up.
[time=1962] And the kid just frees us, and his dad frees us.
[time=1968] And they're looking at Babe Ruth.
[time=1971] Now what's exciting about Babe Ruth? Is it his little pot valley?
[time=1976] Was it that he had some phenomenal athletic frame?
[time=1980] No, he just had this incredible ability to do a mighty deed.
[time=1984] He was able to just smack the ball out of the park over and over and over again when it was needed, when it wasn't needed.
[time=1992] He had mighty deeds, and it just paralyzes the kid.
[time=1996] And he goes, "Ah!" That's what God's thinking about.
[time=2002] See, that would be our natural response.
[time=2004] That would be a reasonable response to God.
[time=2007] He has done mighty deeds.
[time=2012] I want you to turn to a passage in Romans 12 for a minute.
[time=2017] For the third one, because it's the biggest one of all.
[time=2021] In fact, in Romans 12, verse 1, you find the greatest call to worship in all the New Testament.
[time=2026] In all the Old Testament, this is the pinnacle of invitation to worship God.
[time=2035] Many of us haven't memorized.
[time=2037] It says Romans 12, "When I urge you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship." Let me break that down for you just a little bit.
[time=2051] He's saying, "I urge you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God." What he's doing is he's referring back to the previous part of the book.
[time=2058] Do you realize Romans 1, 2, and 3 establish us as the scoundrels that we are?
[time=2063] The absolute sin-soaked, depraved, wicked, selfish, self-centered, hell-bound people that we truly are.
[time=2070] That's what Romans 1 and 2 and 3 is all about.
[time=2073] That we are without excuse.
[time=2075] That there is no justification.
[time=2076] We are not victims.
[time=2077] We are agents of sin.
[time=2078] We have violated a holy God and we deserve nothing but death and hell and misery for all eternity.
[time=2087] These comes in Romans 3, 4, and 5.
[time=2089] He talks about this marvelous thing of being justified by faith through the person of Jesus Christ and how, by accepting Christ as Savior, you can be declared righteous.
[time=2098] You can be made something that you weren't and had no business being absolutely, wholly, and acceptable before God based upon the sacrifice of Christ.
[time=2107] Then he jumps into Romans 6, 7, and 8.
[time=2109] He talks about the powerful spirit-filled life you can lead and how you can be free from the power of sin in your life and how you can live it in a way that honors God.
[time=2118] And then in 9, 10, and 11, he deals with Israel, which was kind of a parenthesis, and then he comes to the main point.
[time=2122] He says, "Now, based on all that, look at chapter 12, verse 12, verse 1, based on all that stuff." He's urging.
[time=2128] Should he have to urge?
[time=2129] It should be just like, get a clue.
[time=2132] Get a life.
[time=2133] Do you know what he's done for you?
[time=2136] What else could you do besides giving your bodies a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship?
[time=2146] Man, I got a new glimpse of this this week.
[time=2149] Just a brief little glimpse of it.
[time=2150] I was sitting in my hotel room.
[time=2151] I've been traveling all week.
[time=2153] And I just flipped on the news there for a second.
[time=2155] I don't know if I even got the whole story straight yet.
[time=2157] But what I think I heard was that there were some boys in Chicago, 11 and 12 or something like that.
[time=2164] And they said to these other two little boys, a little brother combo deal, they're like eight years old and five years old.
[time=2170] You better go in that store and steal some stuff for us.
[time=2172] And they said, "No, we're not going to do that.
[time=2174] Our mom and dad won't let us do that." And so these older boys drug these two little guys, these two little brothers, right, to the top floor of this thing.
[time=2183] And somehow they got that window open.
[time=2185] And they took the little five, I have a five year old in my house.
[time=2190] They took this little five year old and they held them out.
[time=2196] And this little eight year old, I have an eight year old in my house.
[time=2200] Grabbed a hold of his brother and kept him from falling.
[time=2203] And the version that I've heard is that then these boys bit the arms of the older brother until he was in such pain he had to let go.
[time=2211] And I was just repulsed.
[time=2215] I have to confess there was a level of anger.
[time=2218] I wanted to find those two boys.
[time=2221] And I wanted to say, do you know what it's like for that little five year old kid to fall and know he's falling and wonder where his protecting brother went and what happened and why do you let go of me?
[time=2232] And you know what that kid who had to let go is going to live with the rest of his life?
[time=2236] Maybe I could have held on longer.
[time=2239] Maybe I should have let him just bite all the way to the bone.
[time=2241] Maybe I just should have held on somehow.
[time=2244] Maybe there was something and then he felt this little brother release.
[time=2249] And I want to say those two guys.
[time=2251] Do you have any idea what you've done?
[time=2256] And I feel so violated by what they did.
[time=2258] And then I think, man, that's how God feels about me.
[time=2262] That's how God feels about me.
[time=2263] He feels about me like I feel about those two kids dropping that kid out of the window.
[time=2268] I've never done anything like that.
[time=2271] But God is holy and God is righteous and God is just.
[time=2274] And when I'm selfish and when I'm sinful and I commit my little dastardly deeds of sin, he is as repulsed by me as we are by that incredibly diabolical act.
[time=2286] And somehow, some way, something moved in the heart of God
[time=2295] to drop his own son on the planet Earth and say, "Die for Russell.
[time=2300] Die for the guy I despise.
[time=2302] Die for the guy who's doing deeds that are as despicable in my eyes
[time=2309] as what those two kids did in Chicago.
[time=2314] Be swept off my feet?
[time=2317] Have a heartfelt sense of sacrifice?
[time=2320] I would think so.
[time=2324] It seems scandalous that I wouldn't walk around with a greater sense of it every moment of every day.
[time=2329] He saved us.
[time=2331] He redeemed us.
[time=2334] heartfelt sacrifice.
[time=2339] There's one more that came to my mind, future glory.
[time=2343] You don't have to turn there, but in the book of Revelation, these people are gathering around God and they're worshiping.
[time=2348] You want to know why?
[time=2349] Because he's got the whole problem solved.
[time=2351] He's dealt with Satan.
[time=2353] He's dealt with a dead planet.
[time=2354] He's destroyed it.
[time=2355] He's created a new one, a new heaven, and a new earth.
[time=2357] He's brought us all to heaven.
[time=2359] He's glorified us.
[time=2360] He's redeemed us.
[time=2361] He's made us pure and he's put us in his presence.
[time=2364] And they're singing this new song about him.
[time=2366] I mean, they're in the high fevers pitches of worship because of his future glory, his future kingdom.
[time=2372] And they say thou has made them to be a kingdom and priests to our God and they will reign upon the earth.
[time=2378] Worthy art thou because you have purchased with thy blood men from every tribe tongue people in nation.
[time=2386] And they just look at the culmination of the age.
[time=2388] They just look at the eternal state.
[time=2390] They just get a little glimpse of what it's going to be like forever in the presence of God with every longing and every hope and every dream and every desire totally satisfied.
[time=2397] And they just fall down in front of him and worship him.
[time=2401] And what he's saying to us here is, you know, your life may be hard and maybe full of struggle and it may not be as you had wanted it to be.
[time=2408] But I'm telling you, there's a day coming when I meet every single need in your life forever.
[time=2414] It's called heaven.
[time=2416] And there ought to be a response of heartfelt sacrifice to that.
[time=2427] You say, okay, I'm in.
[time=2431] I understand what worship is.
[time=2434] I understand why I ought to worship God.
[time=2436] But you're going to have to help me know how.
[time=2442] You're going to have to give me some really practical instruction as to how I can do this stuff.
[time=2448] Because it's got to be more than three songs, a choir number and a message.
[time=2453] And I know it's not goats and rams and bulls, so tell me what is it?
[time=2458] How do I do it?
[time=2461] I'll give you three categories.
[time=2463] The first one is there's an outward dimension.
[time=2467] It's how you treat people.
[time=2471] The first way that we're going to talk about how you can worship God is how you treat people.
[time=2478] There's some language in the New Testament that is purely worship language.
[time=2483] And we track that worship language around and we run into various examples of the kinds of things that God considers worshipful today in the New Testament, in the church, in our day and in our age.
[time=2494] One of them is how you treat the weaker brother.
[time=2497] Over there in Romans 14, where you've got the weaker brother who doesn't have the liberty to do certain things, and when you defer your rights, when you give up what you're free to do for the benefit of a weaker brother, you are actually worshiping God.
[time=2509] It says this, for he who in this way serves, Christ is acceptable to God.
[time=2514] And the word serves is laetruo in the Greek, which is the word for what the priest would do in the temple.
[time=2520] You are offering up a spiritual ram, a bull, a dove, a goat, when you treat your weaker brother in a way that honors Christ.
[time=2535] There's another one in Romans, and it says, this is the apostle Paul talking about, his own life, he says,
[time=2546] "Because of the grace that was given to me from God to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles."
[time=2553] Now, what does that mean?
[time=2554] He's telling people about Christ, right?
[time=2556] That's his evangelistic effort.
[time=2557] He's witnessing.
[time=2559] It goes on to say this.
[time=2562] "I am ministering as a priest." That's a worship word.
[time=2567] "I am ministering as a priest of the gospel of God that my offering of the Gentiles might become acceptable sanctified by the Holy Spirit."
[time=2577] You get it?
[time=2579] He's running around all over Asia Minor.
[time=2581] He's taking beatings.
[time=2582] He's taking it on the chin.
[time=2584] He's getting wiped out.
[time=2585] And it's not like he's not worshiping God because he understands that as he offers the gospel to people,
[time=2591] and as people respond to the gospel, those Gentiles become goats and bulls and rams and doves that get offered on the altar of the gospel.
[time=2602] And God views that as worship.
[time=2607] That's pretty practical.
[time=2609] We can do that.
[time=2610] We can treat each other right inside the household of God.
[time=2614] We can love each other and be gracious and understanding and compassionate and helpful.
[time=2619] We can do that.
[time=2620] And when we do that, we are worshiping God.
[time=2625] And we can win people to Christ.
[time=2628] And we can offer them up as priests.
[time=2634] That's us.
[time=2635] It's not that guy who's called a pastor.
[time=2637] That's anybody who's in this endeavor of winning.
[time=2640] You become a priest and you offer that person up to God.
[time=2646] There's an inward dimension.
[time=2648] That's the outward dimension.
[time=2649] Now the second category I want to give you is the inward dimension.
[time=2653] There is a way to worship God that has nothing to do with people.
[time=2656] And nothing to do with buildings.
[time=2658] And nothing to do with singing songs.
[time=2664] You don't need to turn there, but it's over in Ephesians 5.
[time=2668] And Paul's just getting all worked up about this.
[time=2670] He's getting so excited about worshiping God through the personal dimension of his own life.
[time=2675] And he says there, you were formerly darkness, talking about before you were saved in darkness.
[time=2683] But now you are light in the Lord.
[time=2686] Walk as children of the light.
[time=2688] For the fruit of the light consists in all goodness and righteousness and truth, trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord.
[time=2695] Now the word pleasing is another worship word in the New Testament.
[time=2699] And what he is saying is when you repent of your sin as a believer and you continue to like the boy in his ball.
[time=2706] You continue to pursue new levels of obedience and new levels of dedication and new levels of expertise at living in obedience and walking as you ought to walk.
[time=2714] As you pursue the goodness and the righteousness and the truth in your life.
[time=2719] That's a worshipful thing to do.
[time=2722] It's like you're lifting that obedience and you're lifting that dedication and you're lifting that devotion up to God.
[time=2729] And he sees the growth and the progress of your goodness and your righteousness and your truth.
[time=2734] He sees the walk of your life which talks about an improving pattern of obedience.
[time=2738] He says you were here back then, but you're here now, you're really growing and you're worshiping me in this.
[time=2749] Then there's kind of the ultimate expression of worship and that's the one we just give to God directly with our lips.
[time=2758] In Hebrews 13 it talks about this.
[time=2762] It says through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God.
[time=2768] That is the fruit of lips that gives thanks to his name.
[time=2772] It's the third category and it doesn't involve people and it's not so much you, it's just saying thanks.
[time=2780] And you know what I mean by saying thanks, I'm not talking about a glib thanks.
[time=2785] You look at your life, you look at your salvation, you look at your family, your kids, your job.
[time=2797] You look at what he's doing and you say God thank you.
[time=2803] Thank you, nothing feels better.
[time=2809] And what strikes me in this verse as I have the others is that it keeps saying it's pleasing to God.
[time=2815] It's pleasing to God, it's pleasing to God, it's pleasing to God.
[time=2820] How exciting it would be for that little boy on that backyard with his dad when Babe Ruth shows up.
[time=2825] If that little boy could just do something that would bring a smile to the face of the great Babe Ruth.
[time=2831] You get it?
[time=2833] These are the things that we can do that actually impact God.
[time=2838] Now I don't know how this works but I want to put it in some language like this.
[time=2841] You having a good day God?
[time=2843] Are you having a good, now see God always has a good day, right?
[time=2846] Because he's God, he's self-sustaining, he needs nothing.
[time=2849] There's a sense in which you can say are you having a good day God and he can say oh yeah, how come?
[time=2857] Well because this person over here is worshiping me today.
[time=2862] They got a heartfelt life of sacrifice and it's touching me somewhere deep in what I am.
[time=2869] I don't know how that works in the totality of what God is but I know from the Word of God it says we can please him.
[time=2874] And that means that somehow he's deriving something from our behavior that brings joy into his existence.
[time=2881] Okay.
[time=2887] Let me just wrap it up this way.
[time=2889] We've been talking about Vision 2002, right?
[time=2893] How does Exalting fit into this?
[time=2896] Well if you've been here at all, you've learned about, we can call our sales clerk Sally.
[time=2901] Remember the gal at LS, I mean LS heirs?
[time=2904] My wife and I ran into the night before this series started who was unsaved and lonely and lost and alone and desperate and without Christ.
[time=2914] And you remember we were thinking there ought to be something we could do to reach her?
[time=2917] I mean there ought to be something to do as a church because the likelihood is she's not going to pop through those doors and walk this aisle and say I want to be safe.
[time=2923] Can I get safe today?
[time=2927] And so we've been talking about starting over here with evangelism.
[time=2931] Somebody in our church needs to go build a relationship with sales clerk Sally.
[time=2937] Somebody's got to prove that there's an unconditional love in her life that is Christ's love coming through your heart.
[time=2944] And somewhere in the context of that meaningful, genuine, authentic relationship of integrity there's going to be a second opportunity for you to tell them about the difference that Christ is made in your life.
[time=2955] Right? And that's scary.
[time=2957] That's almost as scary as the first step.
[time=2961] And then because she may not understand enough about Christianity and you may be her only Christian witness, we want to be able to bring her into the family of God here in an outreach service where she can see you.
[time=2973] And your excitement and your enthusiasm and your wholesomeness and your growth.
[time=2977] And they want to be able to see what you've built and what you've done even in this facility will speak volumes to them.
[time=2984] And we want to have a service that's designed for people like sales clerk Sally who are kind of saying, man, I don't know, I don't know, maybe, maybe not.
[time=2992] Tell me more. Help me understand more.
[time=2997] So we work real hard on that as a church, just like our living Christmas tree.
[time=3002] And then maybe by the grace of God, sales clerk Sally sees it, right?
[time=3005] She gets it and the stuff falls off and she sees Jesus and she comes to Christ.
[time=3011] But we're not done yet because we want to get her into a group of people, maybe a small group, some of you who have walked a little longer and know a little more and care a little deeper.
[time=3023] And we want to bring her with all her trials and all her ugliness and all her struggles and all her weaknesses as a slobbering little infant in Christ, a little babe.
[time=3032] And we want you to put your arm around her and study the word with her and pray with her and solve her problems and care for her needs and build her up, edification, right?
[time=3044] But we're not done yet because now we got to get over to equipping because we know that when Sally came to Christ, she has given spiritual gifts, supernatural capacity to minister inside the body of Christ.
[time=3059] And see, she's had a whole life of feeling useless to God.
[time=3063] In fact, alienated to God, feeling his judgment and his wrath and his condemnation for her sin because she stands apart from Christ.
[time=3071] And what she's going to find out over in this category, in this equipping category is, "Oh my goodness, I'm not only forgiven, but I'm gifted and I can help.
[time=3079] I can be a part. I can make a difference. I can walk away feeling used of God instead of the wrath of God.
[time=3087] Then she'll never be happier.
[time=3089] She'll never know a greater moment in her life than when she feels used of God.
[time=3094] But we're not done yet because there's this thing called exalting.
[time=3100] See, we've been talking about it.
[time=3102] Now, I want you to think about Sales Clerk Sally as she probably still is today, alienated, hurt, lonely.
[time=3109] She's got nothing to sing about.
[time=3113] But all of a sudden, through this process, something starts kind of happening inside of her and she starts recognizing that she's now in connection with the greatest thing in the universe, God.
[time=3123] And she's swept off her feet with the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3127] She's had over heels. She's starry-eyed. She's dazed by the whole thing and she just says, "I'm yours.
[time=3136] What do you want out of my life? I'll give you everything." And then God smiles.
[time=3143] She says, "I'm having a good day. This is great. Sally came to Christ. Sally got edified. Sally got equipped.
[time=3154] And now Sally's doing the worship thing. And I feel it.
[time=3161] Let's pray together.
[time=3166] Lord, we just want to wait on you.
[time=3178] You know, this is just nothing but the Great Commission broken down into some steps.
[time=3182] And we know you've given us the Great Commission.
[time=3185] But we've got to wait on you. You've got to do this thing.
[time=3192] We've got to play our part, each one of us.
[time=3195] We've got to give what we can give and do what we can do and pray how we can pray and learn what we can learn.
[time=3200] Change what we need to change and adjust what needs to be adjusted.
[time=3204] It's going to be traumatic and hard and difficult.
[time=3209] And we've got to wait on you. You've got to do it.
[time=3215] And we together today just say do it. Please do it.
[time=3222] Help us Lord to understand it clearer and be trained to do it.
[time=3228] But by the power of your spirit, move in and through us and let it all happen.
[time=3237] It's your glory, for your worship, for your pleasure.
[time=3245] So we pray God, touch your people once again. Amen.
[time=3252] Would you stand with me as we close our service?
[time=3262] Well, as we were just finishing that message, talking about the process that God brings people through.
[time=3268] From the place of not knowing Christ as Savior, from being alienated from God.
[time=3274] The place of not only coming to Christ and becoming saved, but then being edified and surrounded by loving people.
[time=3281] By learning one's spiritual gifts and how they can contribute to the cause of Christ.
[time=3286] And bringing all that together in the experience of worshiping God.
[time=3293] And I just would have the sense today that there might be a number of you watching this television show,
[time=3299] who have never come to Christ, who are at the beginning of that process and need to take the first step.
[time=3305] And you see it described and it seems incredibly attractive to you.
[time=3309] I mean, that's what you want to have happen to your life.
[time=3312] You're part of that process. You want God doing those kinds of things in your life.
[time=3316] And you're wondering, what's the first step?
[time=3319] I mean, how do I get started? How do I get in that process?
[time=3323] Well, actually, that's a very good question because if you don't start the process in a way that honors God,
[time=3329] you never really get in the process at all. You just get involved in a thing called religion.
[time=3334] I spell religion D.O. which is the continual effort to try to earn the favor of God to somehow do enough good things
[time=3345] that you cancel out the bad things that when it all is said and done, God lets you into heaven based on your merit and what you've accomplished.
[time=3352] And that's not what we're talking about here.
[time=3355] Christianity is spelled D-O-N-E in my mind. It's done.
[time=3360] Christ has done the whole thing. You can't add to it. You can't subtract to it.
[time=3364] You're forgiven because of His completed work on the cross.
[time=3368] And all you have to do is accept that forgiveness through Jesus Christ by accepting Him as your Savior.
[time=3374] And then that process starts. Then you are built up and you build other people up.
[time=3379] And then you do learn your gifts and your talents and how to use them in the church.
[time=3383] And you do worship God, but that has nothing to do with earning your salvation because it's already done.
[time=3389] That's the grace of God that He can forgive us and cleanse us and pardon us.
[time=3394] Well, I just want to take a minute here for some of you who may want to take that first step
[time=3400] of moving out of the thought that you're going to earn salvation and moving into the place where you receive it as a free gift.
[time=3408] If you'd like to accept Christ as your Savior, accept the free gift of God and salvation and start yourself on that journey
[time=3416] to where you become a worshiper of God.
[time=3419] I invite you to bow your head at this time and follow me in this prayer and I'll lead you into asking Christ as your Savior even today.
[time=3428] Let's pray together.
[time=3431] Father, I want you to forgive me for my sins. I want to be right with you.
[time=3437] I want to be in that process of being built up and equipped and being able to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[time=3444] And I believe that that begins by asking Jesus Christ to be my Savior.
[time=3449] And so I do that now. I put my faith in Christ who paid the price for my sin, who died on the cross for me
