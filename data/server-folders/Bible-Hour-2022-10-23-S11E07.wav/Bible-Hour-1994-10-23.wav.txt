[time=0] But you're verse 14, yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
[time=7] You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
[time=12] Instead, you ought to say if the Lord wills, we shall live and also do this or that.
[time=23] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=27] We're glad you've joined us today.
[time=29] Are you working on some exciting plans for the future?
[time=31] Any a college education, a wedding, a business venture, along the weighted retirement?
[time=37] Well, how does God's will figure into what you've laid out for the future?
[time=42] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore talks about the delicate balance of planning ahead, yet stopping short of presuming upon God's goodness.
[time=51] Right now, let's begin with music.
[time=81] We will carry the torch, we will live by the flame.
[time=96] We will march through the darkness with the light of His name.
[time=101] Tell the glory of God is seen by the world, we will carry the torch of the Lord.
[time=116] There's no need for failure, no need for fear, for the Lord goes before us to make our path clear.
[time=128] Let the glorious flame, let the glorious light, let the child through you and child let it shine in the night.
[time=141] We will carry the torch, we will live by the flame.
[time=147] We will march through the darkness with the light of His name.
[time=153] Tell the glory of God is seen by the world, we will carry the torch of the Lord.
[time=164] The torches are sacred, the hope for all men.
[time=170] And as we live to love, we will draw now to Him.
[time=183] We will carry the torch, we will live by the flame.
[time=190] We will march through the darkness with the light of His name.
[time=196] Tell the glory of God is seen by the world, we will carry the torch of the Lord.
[time=205] We will carry the torch, we will carry the torch of the Lord.
[time=212] We will carry the torch of the Lord.
[time=224] How long has it been since you've had a good hard laugh?
[time=240] The stress of life got you down.
[time=242] If that describes you or someone you know, why not write for the free book the Bible hour is giving away to all who write?
[time=250] It's called Fun is Contagious, How to Help Your Family Lighten Up by Chuck Swindall.
[time=256] We'd be very happy to send you a free copy.
[time=259] Our address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=266] Please drop us a note today, won't you?
[time=267] Now let's return to our Sunday morning service.
[time=283] We're gathered here today to worship and make me of the sun.
[time=297] Come, forget about the day and let this be the hour that you're so confined and strange.
[time=310] For we need you, Lord, to our hearts and our core.
[time=318] Make your essence known.
[time=321] It's called in this place.
[time=325] When Jesus is here, let's hold it in this place.
[time=332] I can feel His power here today.
[time=337] Holy Spirit, take control and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=344] We can taste Him our heart for the mercy you have shown.
[time=352] As it is your name, that Jesus, we can so do.
[time=366] You is the Lord.
[time=370] He is the Lord.
[time=372] You are my joy and my song.
[time=382] It was you running through my life near home.
[time=391] For we need you, Lord.
[time=401] Turn our hearts in one and more.
[time=406] Make your essence known.
[time=409] It's called in this place.
[time=414] When Jesus is here, let's hold it in this place.
[time=422] I can feel His power here today.
[time=426] Holy Spirit, take control and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=434] We can taste Him our heart for the mercy you have shown.
[time=442] As it is your name, that Jesus, we can so do.
[time=458] We can taste Him our heart for the mercy you have shown.
[time=472] When Jesus is here, let's hold it in this place.
[time=481] I can feel His power here today.
[time=486] Holy Spirit, take control and bring sweet peace into my soul.
[time=494] For the mercy you have shown.
[time=503] As it is your name, that Jesus, we can so do.
[time=541] When Jesus is here, let's hold it in this place.
[time=560] (Applause) Hello, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=567] Thank you for tuning in today.
[time=569] I guess we are all noticing that the weather is changing.
[time=572] It is becoming colder, it seems, with the passing of each new day.
[time=575] I know that as for me in my house, we are so looking forward to the change in the season, looking forward to the Thanksgiving time and Christmas and all that that will mean for our family and our church and the joy we will share around that season.
[time=588] I feel such a remarkable sense of gratitude to God for the goodness that He gives us in just the closeness of relationships and what the holidays do to even accentuate some of that.
[time=598] And I trust you are looking forward to those things as well and how you might prepare in your heart to be a servant in this particular season as it comes upon us to look for ways to enrich other people's lives
[time=609] in your family and just bless them as you guys share the love and the tenderness that God builds into a family.
[time=615] I also wanted to ask you to join me in praying about a few things that are just on my heart.
[time=620] I have been noticing as I am sure you have that it is election time again and you see these posters of people who are running for office all over the city and you know how important these things are.
[time=630] And I just felt a burden to pray that God would put the right people in office and that the government officials both on a state and a federal level who are leading this country would have a renewed sense of His presence and a willingness to submit to His will and attentiveness to the things of God.
[time=647] So I ask you to pray for that.
[time=649] Another thing that has been on my heart tremendously lately has just been the youth of America.
[time=653] I am so concerned for them. I feel they are adrift.
[time=656] They just seem to be wandering without direction and they are so susceptible to the things of Satan really as he promotes through the music industry
[time=665] and the television and movies and all the different genre that he takes and promoting the ungodly principles, the lack of values, the lack of character, the living for the moment,
[time=676] the seeking, the passing pleasures of sin for a season.
[time=680] And if there's ever been a generation that's being victimized by this, it's got to be those who are youth of today.
[time=688] So we need to just hold them up in prayer.
[time=690] We need to be asking God to protect them and raise up ministries and people who can effectively touch their lives for the cause of Christ.
[time=698] Well, at this time, let's go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=710] [MUSIC - 537 seconds]
[time=1251] [APPLAUSE - 8 seconds]
[time=1263] Amen. Thank you, Margie.
[time=1267] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come to James chapter 4.
[time=1271] That's the book of the Bible we were studying prior to our little detour in Division 2002 and we get to come back to James chapter 4 in a wonderful passage beginning in verse 13.
[time=1283] I think I had an opportunity to spend kind of an exciting moment with a good friend of mine. He and his wife have purchased a lot out at Cherry Hill. I trust you've seen that new development of homes with 18 holes winding in and around that thing just back here behind Arlington Park and this couple of man they've been looking at this thing for a long time and studying the maps and figuring out which plot they're going to have and they are into this.
[time=1307] I mean this guy knows I think as much about how this is going to get laid out as anybody does and he took me out on one of these gorgeous wonderful brisk Indiana fall mornings and haven't we had the best fall like in a long, long time at least in the three years I've been here. It's been pretty good.
[time=1323] And so we were just having a great time out there and we parked the car on the side of the road and he hustles me out into this big thing, a dirt. You know this cornfield is now dirt and we're on this particular fairway and he knows which one and it goes down here and goes over there and there's green over there and then there's this big horseshoe hole.
[time=1339] It's organic that's going to become a horseshoe lake and there's an island out there in the middle of it and that's going to be where this green is going to be and then we walk around that and there's the 18th hole going over here and then we come to this lot that is theirs and it's all staked off and it's huge and it's elevated and it's gorgeous and it's wonderful and I just couldn't believe all I was simply overwhelmed by standing there in the middle of this thing realizing that somebody knew how this was all going to play out from beginning to end. The magnitude and the scope of this project and all the little details have been figured out. The planning and the coordination and the insight and the foresight and the experience that one would have to undertake a project of this magnitude.
[time=1383] They're basically taking a cornfield and they know where all the roads are going to go, all the lots are going to go, where the waterlines are going to run, where the sewers are going to run, where the power's coming from you know what the elevations are going to be, where the lakes are going, where the fairways were found especially intriguing, there were certain trees that were not knocked down so obviously from the get-go they know which trees got to stay and which trees got to go to make this thing picturesque. And literally now I'm out there and I just felt myself worshiping God saying man, I mean this is like an erector set, little teeny erector set to God. I mean he built the whole world, the whole universe, put it all in place, figures it all out, sustains it all, keeps it moving and I said God you are just absolutely amazing how you know everything and can do everything and our control of everything.
[time=1431] And then I found myself rejoicing at what it means to be created in the image of God, that while God is the ultimate architect, you and I have been given these capacities to think and to plan and to see ahead and to know the next step and to learn from our mistakes and do it better next time and pull this stuff off and some of us like me are overwhelmed with that kind of a development project but if it just comes down to how you run your house and how you're going to run your week and how you're going to run your vacations and what's out there for you, we are created in the image of God. And part of that means we can plan and we can think ahead and we can anticipate. In fact the Lord indicated that such a process was healthy and right and to be expected when talking about counting the cost you know to become a Christian and anticipating all that that would entail and he's saying don't get started into that until you really know what you're in for. Count the cost in advance.
[time=1487] Remember what he said for which one of you when he wants to build a tower does not first sit down and calculate the cost to see if he has enough to complete it? Then he says if you fail to do that you lay a foundation and you're unable to finish it and you're ridiculed. In other words you become a laughing stock. You don't do what normal human beings should do. You don't do what you ought to do.
[time=1511] You've got to count the cost, figure it out, plan it out and then proceed.
[time=1515] He also in that same little parable talked about a king. He says which king doesn't go to battle but first he sits down with his advisors and who know the strength of the opposing army and they say do we have enough?
[time=1527] And if we have enough to win then we go into battle. If we don't we send out like the peace treaty group and they go out first and they try to negotiate terms so we never have to go to battle. So that is what it means to be created in the image of God.
[time=1539] And that is right and that is as it ought to be to plan to anticipate to prepare for the future, all that stuff honors God. But there's a subtle yet profound attitude shift that can go on inside the heart as it regards this ability to plan and anticipate and see the future or anticipate the future and plan for it.
[time=1563] That when the attitude shifts you go from honoring God to dishonoring God and you fall into sin and reproach.
[time=1571] You can see it here in chapter 4 verse 13.
[time=1575] Here you've got a guy saying this, come now you who say today or tomorrow we shall go to such and such a city and spend a year there and engage in business and make a profit. Now you see he's got the right deal. He's got a time. It's today or tomorrow. He's got a location. We're going to go to city such and such. He's got a timetable. We're going to stay there a year.
[time=1599] He's got an operation. The Greek word there is imporue which is where we get for emporium which is a place of doing business.
[time=1607] He's going to go do business, a certain kind of business in that city and he's got an objective he wants to make a profit. And you say well what's wrong with that?
[time=1615] That's good and I agree with you. That is good. That is what God has to do. Those are the capacities of the human being as opposed to a deer or a pheasant or a quail or a dove. They don't ever do any of that kind of stuff.
[time=1627] They just move by instinct. God give an instinct. Only those of us who have been created in the image of God have the ability to do that kind of stuff.
[time=1635] Look at verse 14 yet you do not know what your life will be like tomorrow.
[time=1639] You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
[time=1643] Instead you ought to say if the Lord wills we shall live and also do this or that. But as it is you boast in your arrogance.
[time=1651] All such boasting is evil. Therefore to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it to him it is sin.
[time=1659] So in verse 13 you say what's the problem? Well the issue in verse 13 isn't what is said. It's what isn't said.
[time=1667] It's that he's not saying as it says in verse 15 if the Lord wills we will go today or tomorrow to such and such city and spend certain amount of time and engage in a certain kind of business and make a certain kind of profit.
[time=1679] The problem is there's no understanding of the sovereignty of God no expression of dependence upon the sovereignty of God and the ultimate will of God.
[time=1687] Now just so you're not worried verse 13 is not like a passing statement of a really good guy who normally plans on the will of God but is just kind of saying it quick. It's written in the present tense which indicates this is the way this businessman constantly or normally or characteristically thinks. He has cut God out of the equation he's got it figured out on his own. He doesn't think about God and God's plan and God's will and dependence upon God and the variables that God controls when he makes his plans. He just figures that's no problem I'm in charge I'll plan it and I'll do it. But by leaving God out of the equation it reveals an independent attitude. You could call it a practical atheism. There may be an essence to the fact that God exists. I'm sure there's probably a God up there some way. Somewhere there may be a God but my life is up to me the quality, the character, the direction, the good, the bad what really happens in this life is going to be up to me even though there's probably a God up there somewhere. Practical atheism or humanism as we know it Nietzsche and Bertrand Russell and William Ernest Henley for example who died in 1903 and wrote the famous poem Envictus. Listen to him. He acknowledges the existence of God but says it's all up to me. Remember this one out of the night that covers me black as pit from pole to pole. I think whatever God may be for my unconquerable soul. Okay, maybe maybe not a God the point is me and my soul. He goes on "In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced or cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody but not unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tear looms but the horror of shade and yet the menace of the years finds and shall find me unafraid.
[time=1799] It matters not how straight the gate, how charred with punishment the scroll I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul." That says it well. That's the spirit of verse 13. Look I'll tell you what I'm doing. Tomorrow maybe today going over there making a profit coming home.
[time=1819] It's up to me. Now what James is saying is that this kind of attitude can creep into the life of a believer. This kind of mentality can find its way into the life of men and women who have given their lives to Christ who have come to the point of surrender and saying I can't do it on my own salvation is up to you I entrust my life to God. But it's not impossible for this quiet practical atheism to get back involved in the Christian life and I think a lot of it is because God is so consistently gracious to us. He is so consistently merciful to us that we get an opportunity to make plans and so often they come true and so we begin to think that the critical factor is me and me making plans and me working hard to make my plans come true and so God and His grace and His mercy becomes this constant that we just take for granted that we just assume will be there that we no longer really acknowledge except maybe in passing and then the rest of life is struggled for down here with human effort and my own ingenuity and my own talents and my own gifts. This doesn't have to just be business. This could be your educational pursuit.
[time=1895] This could be the planning of a wedding. This could be the spouse relationship thing and how I'm going to get my husband or wife to treat me. This could be the issues of retirement when I'm going to retire, where I'm going to retire, how I'm going to get ready to retire.
[time=1907] This could be just how you plan your summer vacation.
[time=1911] This could be how you plan next Saturday. I know how I want next Saturday to go.
[time=1915] I know what I want there. I know what I want to accomplish. I know what I want to get done and I know what I want for recreation and this is how it's going to go.
[time=1923] I believe God is there but with or without him this deal is going my way. If he wants to help that's fine but by George this will come out the way I want it to.
[time=1935] So help me me.
[time=1939] So help me me. It's going to go my way.
[time=1943] I am the critical factor.
[time=1947] It reveals a remarkably arrogant attitude, look at verse 16, but as it is you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
[time=1955] It is presumptuous.
[time=1959] Now keep your finger here in James 4. You've got to come over to Luke 12 for a minute.
[time=1963] We know this parable and we've seen it before but man it jumped out at me this week in a remarkable way as I was studying James 4.
[time=1983] He is saying this. He's giving a parable. Luke 12 verse 16.
[time=1987] And he told them a parable saying, "The land of a certain rich man was very productive." And he began reasoning to himself saying, "What shall I do since I have no place to store my crops?" And he said, "This is what I will do. I will tear about my barns and build larger ones and there I will store all my grain and my goods and I will say to my soul, soul.
[time=2007] You have many goods laid up for many years to come. Take your ease, eat and drink and be merry." Look up from your Bible for a minute. See here it is.
[time=2015] This is the presumption we're talking about. Here you've got a guy who is saying, "Listen, you can count on me. I know how to do this stuff. I've done it years in the past. I have done it over and over and over again. If you don't think so, look at all I've produced.
[time=2027] I'm a good farmer and I know how to sell my product.
[time=2031] I am a very capable farmer/businessman.
[time=2035] In fact, I am so capable that I am going to now tear down these barns and build bigger barns. There really isn't any equation of chance working into this at all. And I'm certainly not dependent upon God.
[time=2047] I am very confident that I know what I am doing. And this whole thing is up to me.
[time=2053] But look at verse 16 again. Let's get you right into the heat of the thing.
[time=2059] He told them a parable saying, "The land of a certain rich man was what?" How come?
[time=2071] Who was responsible for the productivity of the land? The farmer?
[time=2079] Why is the land productive?
[time=2083] Because God makes it productive.
[time=2087] You say, "No, not true. We have science and technology and we know how to rotate crops and he might have known how to rotate crops too so that his land stayed very productive.
[time=2095] And we can do like these soil enrichment things in our day and age and we don't really have to be dependent upon God for the productivity of our land." Then God laughs at that comment. I mean that just absolutely astounds him. You know, in order to be able to say, "I'm going to leave tomorrow and go to such and such a city and stay there a year and do this business and make a profit," you have to be in control of what?
[time=2119] Everything.
[time=2123] Because if you're not in control of one dimension of it, that one dimension can throw the whole equation out of whack and nothing goes the way you thought it would.
[time=2131] In order to be able to stand up and say, "I am going to tear these down and build bigger ones and fill them," you as this farmer, you have to be able to be in control of every single dynamic in the entire process, which includes the productivity of your land.
[time=2147] And just let's back up behind the modern science breakthrough of soil enrichment.
[time=2153] Who is it that says that soil has to continue to produce at all?
[time=2159] Who is in charge of the biological processes that when you take soil and you cultivate it and you take a seed and drop it in and cover it over, that when it gets water and sun it grows?
[time=2167] Who's in charge of that? Is the farmer in charge of that?
[time=2171] Or is God in charge of that? You see, God sustains that process.
[time=2175] The only reason that ground does what ground does, and the only reason that a seed does what seed does, and the only reason that sunlight does to a seed in the ground of what sunlight does, and the only reason that water does what it does to a seed in the ground is because God sustains the way He has created the earth to be. And when you say "I am going to make a profit, I will determine the course of my life," it is if you are saying, and I happen to be in control of all of the dimensions which interact with my being able to do it the way I said I was going to do it. And in fact, humans are in control of none of those factors. All of those are completely out of our control. All of those.
[time=2219] Let's push it a little bit further. I mean, if you don't think so, talk to the people in Dallas this week. And the Lord up there in heaven, He just turned the rain dial just a little bit to the right. Got just a little little extra rain coming that way. And guess what? The streets are flooded.
[time=2235] And businesses are disrupted. And business plans are disrupted. And I'll bet if you follow it through, businesses are going broke as a result of one little factor called the rain dial. If you don't want to believe the people in Dallas, then call the people in Greece who this week, the Lord did the same thing.
[time=2251] Just touch the rain dial just a little bit and 15 people died because it rained too much. And the streets were flooded and people die and go broke. And business plans are shattered.
[time=2263] Listen to the audacity of a kind of a statement that says, I'm going to tear my barns down and build bigger ones. And then I'll fill those. And when I fill those, I'll say to myself, you're at ease, be merry.
[time=2275] It's absolutely boasting arrogance.
[time=2279] And you kind of, when you think about this, when you kind of come to the conclusion, you know what? I can't control any of that stuff. The only thing I can control is me. I mean, I can't control the rain.
[time=2291] I can't control the sun. I can't control the moon. I can't control the earth, the seed.
[time=2295] But I can't control me. I mean, I can say whether or not I'm going to tear those barns down. I can say whether or not I'll build new barns. I can say whether or not I'll plant some more seed. Well, you're not even controlling you. Look at verse 20. That's the real point of the parable.
[time=2311] God said to this guy, you fool.
[time=2315] This very night your soul is required of you.
[time=2319] And now who will own what you have prepared? Do you realize that we can't even control whether we'll be here tomorrow?
[time=2327] Much less whether we'll get up if we are.
[time=2331] Now it's true that we are responsible to make moral choices as they are informed by the Word of God, but that is a completely different bird than being in control.
[time=2342] We are responsible and help morally accountable for our choices, but we are not in control even of whether or not we'll exist tomorrow.
[time=2350] Back to James 4.
[time=2354] That's fascinating, isn't it? It's just like, wow.
[time=2358] It's so true. It's so simple. But it certainly puts a spotlight on this guy's attitude in verse 13 that I didn't see right away.
[time=2366] I mean, that is an arrogant, boastful statement.
[time=2370] That's what he says in verse 14.
[time=2374] You do not know what your life will be like tomorrow. That's the point.
[time=2378] You don't know if I'm going to adjust the rain dial or adjust the interest rate dial or adjust the sun dial or adjust the earthquake dial.
[time=2386] I mean, you don't have any clue of what I am going to do.
[time=2390] And some people are going to be around when they can read this book and they'll be in the tribulation and they'll see the Lord kind of doing a lot of things with a lot of dials.
[time=2398] You're going to come and the scorching heat is going to come and the hailstone is going to come and pieces and particles of the atmosphere are going to come crashing into the earth and a third and a half of the planet is going to be destroyed. And guess what's going to happen to their plans for business? Absolutely irrevocably destroyed.
[time=2418] He says, you don't know what's going on tomorrow. And then look at verse 14 again and beyond that, you are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away.
[time=2430] I don't know if it was cold enough today to see a vapor as it came out as you breathe, but it soon will be and you have good memory of it.
[time=2438] It's just this little instantaneous thing that forms for a few seconds with no real substance and then disappears. That's it. That's what we are.
[time=2446] We're not only not in control of everything. We're not even in control of our own life and would best be thinking of ourselves as a breath that forms and disappears.
[time=2455] Job, trying to describe the same truth, said, my life is like a cloud that appears in the sky and burrows across the sky and is gone. That's it.
[time=2467] That's how unsubstantial I am in clouds, you know, always changing form and shape and tearing apart and then just gone. He says, my days are swifter than a runner, which would be the fastest thing on earth.
[time=2479] You know, like a horse, a race horse or a fast runner. He's saying kind of the fastest image I've got is of a really fast runner. That's my life.
[time=2487] Then he ups it one to the, he says it's like an eagle that swoops upon its prey. Now that would be the fastest thing he'd ever seen.
[time=2495] They had no cars, they had no bullets, they had none of that stuff.
[time=2499] The fastest thing would have been a swooping eagle after its prey.
[time=2503] That's it. That's my life. He says my life was like a flower that blossoms and then fades. Like those nature films.
[time=2511] Room, room, gone. And he says my life is like a shadow.
[time=2515] What's a shadow? Nothing. Shadows, nothing.
[time=2519] Shadow you block a little bit of light and you get something behind you, but it's nothing. There's no substance to it.
[time=2523] There's my life, he says. Human life is like a vapor because it's fast and it's unstable.
[time=2531] Now what is a human doing saying about what they're going to do tomorrow? Independently of God.
[time=2539] And so you come to verse 15.
[time=2541] It's the obvious response.
[time=2543] Instead the scriptures say, you ought to say if the Lord wills and then he reverses the process we shall live. And also if I get to live tomorrow this is what I'd like to do if the Lord wills.
[time=2559] If the Lord wills wills. I mean please Lord. It's all up to you.
[time=2563] You are the contingent. You are the factor.
[time=2567] I am not. That's why in Psalm 40 verse 8 the psalmist says, I delight to do thy will, oh my God. Thy law is written within my heart.
[time=2579] When you really get an understanding of just how unstable everything is and how out of control you really are and how fast and unstable your own life is you begin to rejoice in the fact that God has a will for your life. And you begin to hunger for it and long for it and pursue it and seek it and you want to stay inside of it.
[time=2599] Because the reality is you're so out of control and you're so unstable outside of his protection and his will man the whole thing is a gamble.
[time=2607] Jesus said the same thing in John 434.
[time=2611] He said, my food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his work. The Lord talked about God's will as his very food, his substance. It was the thing that kept him going. It was the thing that nourished him and that he longed to have in his life.
[time=2627] So the point is don't ignore God's will like the guy in verse 13 and don't even just like kind of enough quiet fatalism, don't just acquiesce to God's will for your life. Go after it, pursue it, find it, learn it, delight in it.
[time=2643] How would you like to be Mr. Spock?
[time=2647] Did you read that article this week in Newsweek? Mr. Spock?
[time=2651] He's 91 years old. They cover this little article on him and it says this. Dr. Spock in despair, subtitle, grown up babies and the mess they made. Here's the first paragraph, listen to this. He, meaning Dr. Spock, is arguably the most influential American alive today. The first edition of baby and childcare, right? That was the big book.
[time=2679] The first edition of baby and childcare appeared in 1946, which means that babies who were raised on it are now almost grandparents.
[time=2687] For years it sold about 750,000 copies annually.
[time=2691] Roughly one for every two marriages in America. That's like almost like the Bible.
[time=2699] I mean this guy is selling 750,000 copies, one for every two marriages in America. But then the article says this. We are what Dr.
[time=2707] Benjamin Spock made us, which is why he had an age when people usually assume that if the worst happens they won't be around to see it anyway is so troubled by the miserable mess Americans have made of their society. You get it? I mean here he is Dr.
[time=2723] Spock and he says, not God's will, don't listen to this.
[time=2727] Don't listen to this insanely antiquated religious, oppressive book that talks about total depravity and children were born sinful and they ultimately need a transforming relationship with Jesus Christ and they need parents who have absolute standards and who give discipline and consequences. Don't listen to this man. Let's go over here. I have a better way. Not God's will, my will.
[time=2747] And I'll put it down in a book. And here's the approach, children are basically good. And children just need a positive orientation in the home.
[time=2755] And you just love on these little guys. They turn out wonderful.
[time=2759] The problem was Spock and everybody else's. He lived long enough to find out that he was dead wrong. And now he's got a whole generation that just declares the ridiculousness of his assumption that he knew better than God.
[time=2775] And I don't want to live outside God's will. I don't want to come to the end of my life at 91 years of age and look back at the major choices in my life and say see I thought I knew better but look at what I've done. Look at the folly of it all. Look at the destruction and the damage and the ridiculous notion that I would know better than God knows.
[time=2803] So verse 15, "If the Lord wills God my whole life man is up to you and you're in control and the objective of my life isn't to establish my own will it is to establish your will in my life." Let me wrap this up.
[time=2823] I just given you three principles by way of application. Three suggestions for you by way of application.
[time=2831] Number one, plan and plan hard. Plan and plan hard. You were made in God's image and that means that like God who planned all of creation who planned all over dimptive history. Do you realize before he even created the heavens and the earth?
[time=2847] He knew Jesus Christ. He knew in predestined Jesus Christ to die in the cross and to be raised again for our sins. That's all part of his plan.
[time=2855] And all you got to do is look at the end of the age as you see it in the book of Revelation. He's got that plan mapped out so we can read it. Plan. Plan hard.
[time=2863] Be meticulous. Invite other people to review your plans for your life.
[time=2867] Invite other godly wisdom wise people to look at your hopes and your dreams and the way you're proposing through your life and invite their counsel. Invite the counsel of the Word of God. Plan and plan hard in business, in education, in retirement, in the church, in relationships. Go after it. That's a capacity God has given you. Don't waste it.
[time=2887] One caution. God plans with a big P.
[time=2891] You plan. I plan with a little P.
[time=2895] Which says this is in subordination to the plan of God.
[time=2899] Every decision I make. Every hope. Every dream is in light of God's will. It's my hope to find it for my life. So it's a humble, dependent heart.
[time=2911] So plan. Number two. Be grateful.
[time=2915] You know what? We have all people on the planet. Auto walk around each and every day with this overwhelming sense of gratitude that just spills out of us. Because we happen to be in a personal relationship with the God who controls all this stuff.
[time=2931] We are not left to the circumstances. We are not left to chance. We are not left to probability. We are not left to be at odds with the great God who controls all this stuff. Every day you get up, you ought to just be going, my land's luck. The sun still shines. The earth is still rotating. I mean, things are still as they were yesterday.
[time=2951] Praise God. I get another shot at life under normal circumstances.
[time=2955] What a blessing. What a real sense of worship and gratitude ought to fill our hearts.
[time=2963] We ought to be just absolutely thrilled that as many plans as we have work out. Do you realize that when you set an educational goal and you fulfill it or you set a financial goal and you fulfill it or you set a goal for your vacation and you fulfill it knowing what we know about all the contingencies and all that we're not in control of, we ought to come to the end of the thing and just have a sense of man. God let me do that.
[time=2987] God empowered me to do that. In the business operation you look at the end of the month or you look at the end of the year and you see you made this amount of money.
[time=2995] There ought to be this sense of I had no business making any of this stuff. As hard as I worked, notwithstanding, this is a gift from God. Praise God.
[time=3007] Genuine heartfelt gratitude. The third thing is find God's will for your life.
[time=3015] Find God's will for your life. You see what's that? Well the first thing starts with salvation.
[time=3019] 1 Timothy 2 verse 3 it says that God's will is for you to get saved.
[time=3023] If you're here today and you are not saved, you don't have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. You have never come into a one-on-one relationship with Christ where He has forgiven you for your sins and you stand at peace before God.
[time=3039] God's will number one for you is that. Don't let another day go by without resolving that. Get in His will. Get saved.
[time=3047] Accept Christ as your Savior. For those of us who are already saved, there's another statement in the New Testament that says this is God's will for you. It's in Ephesians 5. It says that God's will is for you to be filled with the Holy Spirit. The word filled means to be under the control of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3063] What I'm suggesting here is that you at the beginning of each day res surrender your life before you even get out of bed this week. Try it, 7 days in a row. Lay there before you get out of bed. Remind yourself of the truth in this passage and say God, I give you my res surrender the whole package. All my hopes, all my dreams, all my aspirations, my car, my bank account, my career, my relationships, my free time.
[time=3091] It's all yours. Just want to reaffirm that with you God.
[time=3095] I am at your bidding call. I want to be completely your sovereign reign. A submissive humble heart.
[time=3103] And then listen very carefully to the prompting of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3111] Go the rest of that day and listen carefully for the Holy Spirit. That happened to me again this week sitting in my office under all kinds of pressure. You know, trying to get this done and get this done, but this person's name pops into my head.
[time=3127] I can't get it out. I shove it away. Work, work, work, work, work, name back in my head. Shove it away. Work, work, work, work, work, name. Over a two hour period. I finally go, okay, I give.
[time=3139] Pick up the phone, dial the phone number. Hi.
[time=3143] Just wanted to call you, let you know. I was thinking of you, tell you I love how's everything.
[time=3147] The person goes, you know, this is really weird because I was, I just decided not to call you. I had you on my mind.
[time=3155] I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to encourage you, but I knew you were incredibly busy, so I chose not to call you. And you just go, dude, God is in my phone.
[time=3167] God is in my office. God is in my life.
[time=3171] It's true. Now does it always work? No.
[time=3175] Is this some little weird spiritual promise, everything that will work out? You'll just walk from one mountain.
[time=3179] No. Surrender your life to God and just listen. And then after you take the course of action, you can look back and you'll have a sense. He was there.
[time=3191] That was, that was the God thing. God did that.
[time=3195] Why live without it when you can live with it is the point.
[time=3203] Well, plan.
[time=3207] Plan great things. Strategize. Be the most you can be. Do all you can do for God.
[time=3211] Every category of your life, man, set those goals. Get after it.
[time=3215] We got a lot to live for. But plan with a small P.
[time=3219] Secondly, be grateful.
[time=3223] Be just overwhelmed. Hey, the sun's out. I can't see it today because of the clouds, but it's there. He's alive. He's still in charge.
[time=3231] I got another 24 hours. The things are going to remain the same. I can go for it.
[time=3235] Thank you, God. And when you come to the end of a successful project, just look up at him with all the gusto you have in your heart and just be able to see this is you.
[time=3243] This isn't me. I can't control any of this. This is you.
[time=3247] Thank you. And lastly, do as will. If you're not saved, get saved. And if you are saved, man, just constantly res surrender your life. Listen.
[time=3259] Let him lead you. Let him walk you through.
[time=3263] Let's pray together. Father, it's just fun to
[time=3271] know that it's like that.
[time=3275] Now, I want to wait the unsaved community carries around on their shoulders.
[time=3279] And what a perspective you bring to us in a set of verses like this. It closes out for the one who knows the thing to do and doesn't do it to him and his sin.
[time=3291] And that includes obeying just the objective truth of God's word.
[time=3295] Lord, if somebody's here today and they're in a sexual impure relationship. I mean, that's a given.
[time=3303] They got to get out of that. Convict them of that right now.
[time=3307] And motivate them to jump back into your will.
[time=3311] If there's a businessman here today who's involved in a shady deal and taxes aren't being reported, or profits aren't being properly reported, or somebody's not being treated right, and somebody's telling half-truth and we're shading this stuff. God, that's an obvious no-brainer.
[time=3331] Repent and get back in the middle of God's will.
[time=3337] Obedience is assumed, but help us go the next step to where there's this unique intimate relationship with the Holy Spirit, where these promptings can be heard and responded to and there's this sense that you're with us day by day, moment by moment, even as Margie sang in the song.
[time=3361] We just want to honor you and love you.
[time=3365] Pray these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3369] Well, let me invite you to stand as we close our service today.
[time=3373] [MUSIC]
[time=3388] Well, it's exciting to know that God has a will for our lives and that it's such a wonderful desire that it all begins by accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3399] And maybe you've never done that. Maybe you've been involved in church or religion of some kind, a long time. Maybe all your life.
[time=3405] But you know there's never been a time when you've accepted Jesus Christ personally into your heart to be your Savior.
[time=3412] It's wonderful to know that that's God's desire for your life.
[time=3415] In fact, that's the first thing he wants you to do is to be saved through Christ.
[time=3419] And if you know that you're a sinner, if you know that you need forgiveness, if you know that you don't really measure up to God's divine standard, I invite you to bow your head here in just a minute with me.
[time=3428] I want to pray and lead you in a prayer that would have you invite Christ into your life to be your Savior. It's a wonderful decision to make.
[time=3437] And I invite you to do that right now. Why don't we bow our heads for prayer?
[time=3442] Lord, I know that I'm a sinner. I know that I have violated your law.
[time=3446] I've violated your will. I deserve death and hell and all the rest of it.
[time=3452] But I understand that Jesus Christ can be my Savior, that if I put my faith in Him and ask Him into my heart, He'll save me and forgive me for my sins.
[time=3460] And so I do that right now. Christ, please come into my heart and save me.
[time=3465] Be my Savior. Forgive me for my sins. I put my trust in you.
[time=3470] And I pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3474] Well, if you've just prayed that prayer and meant it from your heart, if you've made that decision to come to Christ, please write us and let us know about that.
[time=3483] In a moment, I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of "Lessons on Assurance" or the booklet entitled "Fun is Contagious." You can also receive a cassette copy of today's message.
