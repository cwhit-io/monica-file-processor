[time=0] If a person is rich, they are rich because God has made them rich, God has given them
[time=6] money.
[time=7] And you could say no, it's because they've worked hard.
[time=10] Well, that is true, and somehow that combines in the process, just like an athlete who has been given natural talents and abilities, works hard to use them and refine his skills.
[time=20] But basically, anything that a person has has been given to them by God, and riches are
[time=26] not outside that spectrum.

[time=858] I see the strain of joy the threat of pain help me this love to move by some
[time=887] clear winning a word teach me and I'm in my word way
[time=917] hope that says shining rain the future's growing way in peace that I'll leave the cast here with the
[time=947] last let me walk with you.
[time=977] Amen well let me invite you to open your Bibles this morning to James chapter 5
[time=990] and if you are visiting with us this morning it might be helpful for you to
[time=997] know that it's our custom in this church on Sunday mornings to preach through a book of the Bible we've got the book of James that we're working through and this morning we happen to come to chapter five and this particular passage is
[time=1011] scalding hot it's a passage about judgment it's a passage about really it
[time=1018] ushers us into a courtroom the very courtroom of God and there are some people who are being held accountable for some things that they have done in their life this is at the end of the age the day of judgment and really it's a it's a
[time=1031] severe passage the people in view here are religious people people who have
[time=1037] come out of Old Testament Judaism and have has associated themselves with the New Testament church they claim to be Christians they claim to be saved they claim to be born again but they are not and as you'll see this passage will reveal that to you be on any shadow of a doubt these people do not have a personal relationship with God they have not been forgiven they are not graced by the power of the Spirit of God in their lives are not living it according to the Word of God these people are also very rich very very wealthy people and they
[time=1069] are not on trial for being rich the Bible nowhere condemns wealth and being rich and having a large income and those kinds of things they are in fact on trial for what they have done with their riches in fact it is what they have done
[time=1084] with their riches that reveals the true condition of their heart that they are not saved and therefore worthy of judgment riches are a gift from God much
[time=1094] like being born beautiful much like people who are given exceptional musical
[time=1100] talent above and beyond what would be normal those who are given athletic abilities those who are given superior intellectual capacity these are just gifts and they are given from God and wealth is among these kinds of gifts and
[time=1115] you might be tempted to think of it as as something not like a gift because you have to work to get your money and there's a sense in which that's true and you also have to work to develop the musical talent that's given you the athletic ability the intellectual prowess so there's always the dimension of adding to what God has given but fundamentally riches like any other talent or attribute are a gift of God Deuteronomy eight says remember the Lord
[time=1139] for it is he who gives you the power to make riches it is God in fact who
[time=1145] gives you the ability and the power to make wealth Proverbs 10 22 says it is the blessing of the Lord that makes rich and first Corinthians 4 asks the
[time=1156] searching question what do you have that you did not receive and that grabs
[time=1162] any and every category of of blessing that you might think of so there are
[time=1169] some people they are religious people they are claiming to be born again Christians but they are not they are fabulously wealthy and they are brought to court not a Jewish court not a Gentile court but the very courtroom of God and as you might expect with any courtroom scene there this passage will reveal basically three things the charges that are brought against these people the evidence or the witnesses to substantiate the charges and then the verdict is assumed and we jump straight to the sentencing and unlike the American
[time=1203] court system which if we were to try to do that for any particular person would take us months maybe years this passage will covered in six verses and will be done by noon James 5 1 opens with a pronouncement come now you rich weep
[time=1219] and howl for your miseries which are coming upon you that's kind of an
[time=1225] introduction that's kind of saying look in light of what these next few verses carry the only proper response for the rich are that they begin right now to weep and to howl those two words are descriptive of the opening open lament verbal sobbing of someone who is about to who has just or is about to suffer
[time=1243] great calamity it is used in Luke 7 of a mother who has just lost her only son and she herself a widow and so in that ancient day the only possible hope of continuing to to be provided for in her remaining son is taken from her she has the emotional loss of her son and so she openly weeps the idea behind howl is
[time=1264] kind of a violent uncontrollable emotion or the expression of such why because misery is coming the judgment of God well first of all then the charges
[time=1277] what have these poor people done to be in line for misery miseries of this
[time=1284] magnitude that would cause them to weep and to howl four charges are brought against them the first you can find in verses two and three it says your riches have rotted and your garments have become moth eaten your gold and your silver have rusted you can stop right there basically they have hoarded their
[time=1304] wealth they have crossed a line between being a good steward of your resources
[time=1311] and not presuming on God thereby not spending everything you just made setting some back for future contingencies somehow they've crossed that line they've gone beyond that and they are guilty of hoarding their riches stockpiling them riches in this particular day were gathered and hoarded and collected in basically three categories beyond land and housing the three categories are here first verse to your riches that's like wheat and grain and barley in this agrarian community people would stockpile their riches by stockpiling food so they wouldn't have to work for tomorrow they stockpiled so much of it it never got used and it rotted the second category in which they would gather their riches
[time=1354] were in garments and these were the long outer flowing garments which would be very expensive in the fabric and the weave of the fabric and then they would take jewels and weave those into the fabric itself and these would become family heirlooms and be passed from one generator to the next there could literally be fortunes wrapped up in a particular garment and the last category
[time=1374] he mentions here are gold and silver gold and silver coins the garments never got properly used so they were moth eaten and the gold and silver apparently coins that were mixed with a certain kind of alloy which left to themselves if stashed in the ground or stashed in a wall because there were no banks and there were no vaults which made it very difficult and that's why throughout the New Testament you'll find the idea you shouldn't do this with your money because the thief breaks in and steals if it's left unmolested it sits there
[time=1404] and literally rusts the alloy content there will eventually rust because it was not used because it was not put into circulation it eventually rusted the charge is that you have hoarded and stockpiled your wealth instead of putting it to good use that's the point you hoarded your wealth rather than putting
[time=1425] it to good use look at the end of verse three there's a phrase there that seems to explain the irony of it all it is in the last days that you have stored up
[time=1436] your treasure or treasured up your treasure stored we get our English word
[time=1442] thesaurus from the word stored which means a treasury of words you have treasured up your treasures I mean you've just stockpiled the things and what is so ridiculous is you have done that in the last days now that doesn't mean the the tribulation period the last days is a phrase in the Bible that describes the time after the first coming and before the second coming of Christ that's our age that's their age it's the last days and James can't believe it I mean it just
[time=1472] what do you mean you have taken your riches and you have stored them up and hoarded them up in the day of opportunity for people to come to Christ these are
[time=1484] the last days the payment has been made in the blood of Christ in fact God has given the most valuable possession he has in his son and his son gave the most valuable possession he had in his own blood I mean they went the distance to give up their treasures to make salvation possible and God gifts you with financial resources and you hoard them for yourself in the day in which people
[time=1509] could come to Christ preposterous unbelievable the time is short hell is
[time=1516] hot the stakes are high is what this is saying and in the time like that you
[time=1522] chose to treasure your treasures instead of using them for the glory of God instead
[time=1528] of putting them to use hold your finger there in James 5 if you will and and come to 1 Timothy 6 and you'll see here just a few verses which give a world of
[time=1541] instruction to the rich what should they have been doing what should they have been doing with their wealth first Timothy 6 verse 17 instruct those who
[time=1554] are rich in this present world not to be conceded or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches but on God in other words these rich people both in this church and the one in James we're we're we're saying now look we've gotten
[time=1569] to a certain standard of living and we don't ever have want to retreat we don't ever want to go backwards we don't want to ever live without as much money as we have right now and so as the extra money comes in we stockpile it to make sure
[time=1583] we never have to go backwards because we don't really trust God we don't really
[time=1590] trust God to lead our lives and maybe it is God's intention that at some point we would have to fall back to a lower standard of living or maybe it is God's plan that though we give generously and liberally he'll continue to give us additional funding so we never have to change our standard of living either way the point is we don't trust God we're not gonna find out and so rather than giving we hoard verse 18 instruct them to do good and to be rich in good works
[time=1621] to be generous and ready to share open it up let it go open your hand and give
[time=1629] away things that you do not need money that you don't have to have be generous
[time=1637] and it says in verse 19 when you do that you see you're storing up your
[time=1643] thesaurus thing you're treasuring for yourselves treasures of a good foundation for the future so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed now that's an interesting little phrase life indeed real life is found
[time=1657] in the generous distribution of what God has given you which is extra above and beyond your needs that's where real life is found that's the good life that is the good life and when you do that you treasure up a foundation for the
[time=1673] future the kind of future called eternity we can go back to James 5 the Bible
[time=1680] tells us to use our money to provide for our families right and if you don't provide for your family the Bible tells us you're worse than an infidel or an unbeliever and there is a point in providing for your your immediate and your extended family that there's a place for savings and that somehow in
[time=1699] the spirit of God is individually determined and you finally get to a place where you say enough or you say I'm not going to save at this rate because I'm going to help the orphan in the widow which are those point people for the needy in the New Testament the people who are less fortunate and there is a point
[time=1718] to give to the church as we read through the New Testament constantly saints giving to the work of God through the church Luke 16 talks about using your money to win people to Christ and so that the people you've won the Christ when when they get to heaven in front of you you show up in heaven and they greet you and they say praise God your resources were freed up on my behalf and I'm now in heaven because you chose not to stockpile but these particular people
[time=1748] never did that these particular people were not interested in that they hoarded and that's charge number one charge number two is found in verse four they robbed the poor behold the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields and which
[time=1764] has been withheld by you cries out against you now what's going on here well a
[time=1770] laborer in this particular part of the world at this particular time in history was a person who would work in the field of a farmer and you see the farmer having a cyclical business wouldn't hire people all the time I mean he wouldn't put them on for every day of the year he would hire them when he needed them he would hire them at the appropriate moment when the crop needed to be harvested or planted or whatever the need was and in the interim he wouldn't keep them on the payroll and so it was a common practice for the farmer to go into the marketplace and find there the men and the women who wanted to work and he would agree to them for days work and a day's wage common practice and God
[time=1811] built in to this particular society the Jewish readers or the the people who are being tried here into the Old Testament law protection for these day labors so they wouldn't be abused because they were susceptible to abuse they had no real power Deuteronomy 24 15 says you shall give him his wages on his
[time=1832] day before the sun sets for he is poor and he sets his heart upon it this day
[time=1840] laborer was apparently only living a hand of mouth and when he would work all day he needed that stuff that night so he could live the next day and so the law of the Old Testament Leviticus 9 you shall not oppress your neighbor nor rob him the wages of a hired man are not to remain with you all night until morning you pay him at the end of the day because he's poor what's going on in
[time=1863] James 5 is not just delay it's not well I'll pay you at the end of the week it's I'll never pay you the pay never got paid and now you can start to see the heart
[time=1874] condition of these rich not only are they not trusting God for their future and hoarding up for themselves but they have no compassion for people their eyes are
[time=1887] shut to the needs of other people while their eyes are wide open to the luxuries that they want to enjoy this is not a matter by the way of them getting rich
[time=1898] by withholding this labor I I believe that these rich people got rich by the magnitude of their enterprise they could have paid these laborers and still been rich they were just so greedy and so given to their own materialism and so
[time=1916] disenfranchised from the needs of other people that if they could get a couple extra bucks here they just as well do it that's what this these that's who these people are and this they are doing in the last days a day in which salvation is
[time=1932] available a day in which they should have been going to the marketplace each morning with the prayer under their breath oh God help me hire the ones who are most ready to hear about Christ right help me hire the ones who then on my
[time=1946] farm and seeing my splendor and seeing the things which you have given me would be most responsive to want to know the same Savior as I know these are the last
[time=1958] days these are the days when the gospel needs to be presented but instead of
[time=1964] having a view for the kingdom even as they look at individuals they look at individuals with harm in their eyes willing to subject them to hunger and
[time=1976] those they are trying to provide for so they can gain a little bit more wealth
[time=1982] the third charge is in verse 5 and it's for having an exorbitant standard of
[time=1988] living verse 5 you have lived luxuriously on the earth and let a life of wanton
[time=1994] pleasure the word luxurious means soft you have patted your life you have done
[time=2002] whatever you've needed to do to have a soft existence and man given enough time
[time=2009] and enough privacy and enough money will will fall into this stuff to the point
[time=2015] that it reaches a place of wanton pleasure which is a term describing excess and
[time=2021] waste in other words they're so committed to having a soft life that if that if things are wasted along the way material possessions that have value but they've got so much money they don't much care right now they just waste the thing just excess they've lost touch with the value of things the fourth the
[time=2046] fourth charge is found in verse 6 and this really gets it out there at the edge
[time=2052] you have condemned and put to death the righteous man and he doesn't resist you
[time=2058] we'll talk about that in a minute you have condemned and put to death the righteous man apparently that the verbiage here is of the courtroom again apparently this righteous man has done what is reasonable he has taken his employer to court he has pleaded his case he has said man we didn't get paid and we needed to get paid we did the work the terms were agreed to we never got paid so this this alleged Christian this professing believer who knows the
[time=2089] Old Testament who knows some of the New Testament who knows the truth gets held accountable what's his feet to the fire on this issue in the court system and instead of repenting and saying you know I'm guilty I didn't pay them and it was
[time=2104] sinful and it was materialistic and here's the money I owe them now sentence me as you will I will pay my debt to society I'm wrong I'm instead of doing that they
[time=2116] buy the court they go behind the scenes and they buy the court and they bride the judge and where you have an innocent righteous man he ends up being condemned and put to death and there is no connective in the Greek there's no and it would read this way you condemned you killed the righteous man to show the swiftness of the whole thing you condemned you killed the righteous man boom boom dead you just went after it like a vengeance rather than repentance
[time=2142] rather than repentance which might lead to public shame the loss of your wealth entirely or the loss of your use of your wealth you got even harder hearted and
[time=2153] even more committed to yourself indulgent way of life and so you bribed and bought and and corrupted the system which eventually did in the death of
[time=2164] those you had previously stolen from you see what I mean these are not believers
[time=2172] believers don't act like this this is the wicked rich professing believers
[time=2178] associated with the church knowledgeable of the scriptures wicked hearted now he reveals this horrible digression here doesn't he and I don't
[time=2190] know if it's riches or if it's good looks or if it's intelligence or if it's athletic ability whatever whatever benefit God has given you we're all susceptible to this first we misuse the gift of God by hoarding it for ourselves
[time=2207] then we get so selfish and so committed to having more of the same and so
[time=2213] disenfranchised the needs of others that we begin to rob them of the proper use of our gift whether material or otherwise in our passion for ourselves
[time=2225] grows to such an extent that we are characterized as luxurious and wanton
[time=2231] pleasure and we then are so far down that path that when it's time to be held accountable an opportunity for repentance presents itself rather than such repentance which might mean the loss of that privilege we lie we cheat we buy
[time=2249] off the judge we pervert justice and commit murder it's a horrible
[time=2255] progression now the evidence and this is kind of an interesting thing why would
[time=2261] God bring evidence God knows everything right I mean you don't fool God he doesn't have to say well here I can prove it he was there but always in these
[time=2273] judicial passages in the New Testament almost always there is evidence presented and it's not for God's benefit it's for their benefit it's for the people being tried it's so that they are pierced to their inner being with the reality of what they have done and it is for we who already are forgiven to know
[time=2293] that the same kind of evidence would have been brought against us if not for the saving grace of God well the evidence look in verse 3 and this would be a great thing for Steven Spielberg to get a hold up because he could animate this thing I mean he could make this happen and you're you would have goosebumps of fear all over your body as they brought this stuff to life because this is a terrifying thing verse 3 your gold in your silver have rusted and their rust
[time=2321] will be a witness against you somehow in the process of hoarding this wealth
[time=2327] the the alloy inside the pure gold and silver began and the rust formed and now
[time=2334] in the day of judgment in the courtroom to substantiate the charge the rust is animated or personified it shows up in the courtroom and it points the finger
[time=2346] and it says am I not evidence enough that this person hoarded their wealth I am
[time=2353] the product of their hoarding I am the result of such hoarding and I have come
[time=2359] to bear witness against them I that I never would have existed if this man had
[time=2367] properly used the resources which God had given him rust would never have occurred I am the unused misused representation of wealth the undeniable
[time=2378] witness we never got used for God is what the Russ says the Russ is saying we
[time=2387] wanted to be let out I mean I was with the gold and the silver who wanted to be used for the glory of God we wanted to be put into the work of the church we wanted to help the needy widow down the street we wanted to be generous with with people so that the gospel could be propagated but we were never released and instead we were left there to corrode and so here I am I'm the Russ and then
[time=2412] another piece of evidence or witness comes into the situation in verse four behold the pay of the laborers who mowed your fields and which has been withheld by you cries out against you what is this this is the pay the exact
[time=2427] pay the exact monies that should have been given to the laborers who mowed the fields but was withheld we're here too we're the money the exact money not
[time=2439] general money we are the exact stuff that should have gone to that labor and that labor and that labor and multiply by how many laborers there were and by
[time=2449] the way you see the phrase cries out this is not some humble little cry this is a phrase or a word that's used in mark nine of a demon that's screaming at the top of his lungs as Jesus is casting him out of a demon possessed little boy and in the process of being cast out the boy by the demon gets thrown on the ground and rolls around and is foaming at the mouth is in convulsions and this demon screams as he goes out that's what this pay is doing this is a noisy scene this
[time=2478] whole courtroom has a lot of noise in it because there's a lot of payment that never got paid and it's shrieking it's shrieking its witness against the accused and then there is a third piece of evidence the third witness or set of
[time=2494] witnesses show up verse four at the end of the thing and the outcry of those who
[time=2500] did the harvesting has reached the ears of the lord of the harvest not only does the rust make accusation not only does the pay of the labor make accusation but the labor of themselves cry out and as those poor dear souls men and women having worked that long day hoping to receive just enough to live the next day went home and found the rest of their family maybe a grandma who really needed food and there was no way to feed them and they cried out to God and they said how can you let this happen to us how is it that we are not able to eat how is it that we go again without substance and then there were other cries weren't there when those very laborers took that wealthy wicked person to court and the man bought the court off and then there was judicial murder and
[time=2549] there were homes with weeping in it because somebody died not only did we not get our pay but we lost one of our family members over this whole thing you see that never goes away those cries they make it up into heaven and the Lord
[time=2565] of Sabbath hears it and what is important is that the accused now hears it to and
[time=2577] there's just absolutely no way around the issue now I have no idea whether or
[time=2585] not OJ Simpson killed those people or not right we don't know the fact is we
[time=2593] may never know the fact is justice may never be done he may receive a guilty
[time=2599] verdict and he may have been innocent he may receive an innocent verdict and he may have been guilty we do not know but I can guarantee you one thing that if he
[time=2609] did and that's a big if but if he did murder these two people right now their
[time=2616] blood is crying out from the ground and it reaches the ears of the Lord of hosts
[time=2624] and that is true of any murderer who has ever murdered all the way back to Genesis 4 where Cain slew Abel and the Lord said to Cain the blood of your
[time=2634] brother Abel cries out from the ground you see you just got understand you don't
[time=2641] get by with things with God and it's not just that he has a vague memory of what
[time=2647] you did there is living evidence noisy evidence of the deed maybe OJ is guilty
[time=2656] and maybe OJ will be found innocent or a reduced charge but short of the saving
[time=2663] grace of God which we would hope for his life short of have coming to Christ and being forgiven for this if in fact he is guilty he will be in this kind of scenario and that very blood will be a part of that which tries and convicts him
[time=2678] of his sin it's terrifying so the charges are brought the evidence is
[time=2688] marshal the verdict is implied guilty and now there is the sentencing it begins
[time=2694] there in verse one as we mentioned they're described in a general way as miseries there is going to be great misery for these people unrelenting pain
[time=2704] no second chances but it's described here as we go into the text again look at
[time=2712] verse three the rust goes from being a witness to being the executioner and you can see Spielberg somehow doing that where the rust at first was doing its witnessing job but once the verdict is granted then the rust consumes it moves towards the accused and begins as you can see in the middle of verse three consume your flesh like fire the rust will be a witness against you and will
[time=2736] consume your flesh like fire it's powerful imagery rust moves very slowly
[time=2744] but fire is very painful and so it brings to mind the imagery of hell which
[time=2751] is the the fire that is never quenched and you say how can a person burn forever in hell because fire consumes things and eventually would get consumed right John 5 both the righteous and the unrighteous are resurrected unto judgment and the unrighteous are fitted with bodies that are suitable for eternal destruction that's why there can be an unquenchable fire that's why
[time=2775] people can burn forever in living torment because their body what they are refitted with in the second resurrection is able to be consumed forever yet never
[time=2785] consumed and so this rust like the rust on a rusty chain even in our lives now
[time=2792] which could eat into your flesh if left there long enough like a festering sore begins to consume their flesh but with the pain and the torture involved of fire yet with the slow process it's grisly it's eternal it's
[time=2811] unrelenting it never stops now the picture is further drawn in verse 5 you
[time=2820] have lived luxuriously on the earth and led a life of wanton pleasure you have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter so the imagery of slaughter think of a
[time=2830] pig that the farmer wants now to slaughter and he isolates the pig or pigs and puts them in a very confined space and then begins to dump food into that pin and if pigs could think these pigs might think man I'm privileged I
[time=2849] mean look here comes more just what I like the choice of the choice and I just
[time=2856] eat it and eat it and it's all gone and then suddenly there's more and I consume that on myself I must be a very privileged individual and yet even on
[time=2865] the day of slaughter the pig still doesn't understand what he is doing is hastening the day of slaughter and preparing himself for the day of slaughter and it has nothing to do with being privileged and so it is the misunderstanding and the blindness of the wicked rich and they receive these things and they say look this is for us so we'll consume it upon ourselves we must be privileged we must be special we must be truly unique and even up to
[time=2895] the day of their slaughter they don't realize that what they are doing is hastening and preparing themselves for the day of slaughter it's a total misunderstanding of the situation on their part they completely missed the point they don't even know what they're doing to themselves they are participating in their own slaughter by the abuse of their wealth I told you
[time=2923] this was kind of a scorching hot passage let me let me draw this thing to a
[time=2929] conclusion with like four questions that I just want to bring for application and you know we look at these people and we say well we're not a lot like them I mean for a couple reasons number one we're not rich like they're rich and for
[time=2943] another reason we're not doing these kinds of things I mean we're not hauling people or when we get into court we're not buying the court off and we're not stealing from people and we're not putting people to death and getting sentences of condemnation when they shouldn't I mean they were not doing that stuff so how does this relate to me well we'll try this for a minute let's
[time=2961] think of it in not absolute terms of being very rich and very ungodly let's think of it as a continuum and if there's very poor over here and very very rich over there we certainly know we don't belong on the very poor side of the continuum I mean especially as Americans we're in here somewhere right we're on the richer side of things in fact the Bible says you're rich if you have more than you need to eat to clothe yourself and to find shelter anything above and beyond that you're in the category called rich now we're not all the way over there like those people are in this passage we're not like wealthy wealthy but we're rich so we're on the continuum and we're on their side of it and let's talk about godliness and ungodliness and and we're not over here with these people I don't think these ungodly people we're not stealing from people and putting people to death and bribing judges and perverting justice but but we might not be all the way over there on the far side of godliness I mean we're in here somewhere aren't we where we can struggle with sin we could be tempted so in the thought of a continuum let me ask you four questions
[time=3026] that might relate but maybe you could use this week question number one are
[time=3032] you hoarding your wealth are you hoarding your wealth do you believe that as the
[time=3040] spirit of God talks to you that you have indeed crossed that line where you stopped making normal preparations really confident in God submissive but
[time=3051] somehow you've jumped over that line now and you're doing this hoarding thing which will which really reflects a lack of trust I don't know any help there I
[time=3063] mean anybody kind of doing that anybody moving in that direction anybody got big plans on that stuff and as a result your resources are not as available to God today as they should be see that's you know that's an individually decided matter we can't put a figure on that we can't put an amount but maybe maybe here's a way you could know and if we were to take your giving record not just to this church but everywhere I mean wherever you're giving and put that up right there would you feel a sense of shame or could you say yeah that's what
[time=3097] I'm doing I wish I could do more but that's what I'm doing and that's all I can do I mean that's what I'm doing that's all that's what I'm doing that's what God's having me do right now and maybe lay against that well how you're planning for your future are we are you okay there or do you need to make some adjustments second question are you involved in any type of fraud any type
[time=3121] of fraud let's take the IRS you do anything with the IRS that if the IRS
[time=3128] knew about they wouldn't they wouldn't buy and I know there's some stuff in there where you're dealing in in in you know it's not all defined there's some gray areas in there but but there's a lot of really black and white areas with the are you pushing that thing at all because if you are you're defrauding the
[time=3145] United States government and you've been told to submit to them even if you don't like what they do with your money or how much of it they want playing any games there how about your expense report are you saying certain
[time=3159] things are tax deductible expenses that really aren't are you reporting things to your employer as it as as an expense that really aren't are you taking things home from work with you things that are the companies that need to stay at work but you can use them at home employee theft it's a multi multi-million dollar
[time=3179] problem are you failing to be generous maybe maybe you're an employer maybe
[time=3186] you have people underneath you corporate or private either way are you failing to be generous with them I don't I don't mean pushing the boundaries where you can no longer be competitive but maybe even paying them a good rate and then coming alongside with your own resources because you know it is the last days time this short hell is hot stakes are high and you're coming up with some
[time=3206] stuff out of your own pocket at a particular point in their life to let them know there's something unique and different about a Christian are you
[time=3218] failing the whole up your side of a bargain some of you guys are in business and the thing looks really good up front and the venture is going to make this amount of money and suddenly it isn't and now we're going back and forth and and that may need to happen but maybe you're doing it with an attitude that is fraudulent in nature you're not willing to really step up and take the hit you should hit or you should take anything fraudulent at all the third question
[time=3242] is this are you living for luxury good night who whose idea was asking that
[time=3249] question you live in for luxury when you think about tomorrow when you think
[time=3256] about next month when you're planning for for what's happening next is it a plan to be able to free up resources to advance the cause of Christ or is it a plan to free up resources so your life can get just a little bit softer get just a little bit more luxurious get just a little bit more full of pleasure
[time=3275] now see only you can answer that we can't answer that for each other that's a Holy Spirit thing but what's going on question number four have you murdered
[time=3290] anybody lately no I haven't murdered anybody lately Russell don't be ridiculous no no have you murdered anybody lately Matthew chapter five the Lord says that you have heard it's been said thou shalt not commit what murder but I say to you that if you are angry in your heart so that you say Raka you are guilty and
[time=3314] deserve to be thrown into the everlasting fire as if you had committed murder see God's looking at your heart right and so I want you to probe that
[time=3324] whole money issue and people at work taking your position get in the promotion those of you in private business the competition which is fine go after them do your best but are you angry at people because of financial
[time=3339] dealings are you saying in your heart man somehow I wish that person we're dead I am so mad at that person because and then however that finishes
[time=3350] whatever money you lost or however you were threatened in your standard of living have you murdered anybody lately over money suddenly you put us on this
[time=3366] continuum and this passage has a few things to say to us doesn't let's pray
[time=3372] together
[time=3383] well as you can see that's somewhat of a strong passage that predicts the
[time=3397] judgment of rich people who do not love the Lord and who do not use their wealth in a way that honors the Lord and there are many people who don't have riches but who are headed for a similar kind of judgment because they don't love the Lord and they don't have Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior and maybe as you look in your own heart today you look at your life you anticipate a courtroom scenario such as that and the last thing in the world you ever want to do is to have to stand before God and give account for your behavior the wonderful news is that Jesus Christ can set you free forgive you for your sins and remove you from ever having to stand trial for your own sin because Christ stood trial for himself and paid the price in his death and resurrection if you'd like to receive that forgiveness if you'd like to be pardoned I invite you to bow your head right now and accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior let's pray together Father I know that I am a
[time=3454] sinner I know that I belong in a courtroom such as that where you would evaluate me and I know you'd find me guilty as a sinful person and the punishment would be extreme and forever I thank you that you provided forgiveness in the person of Jesus Christ that he has died for my sins that he has paid the price for my misdoings and I accept Christ as my Lord and Savior receive
[time=3480] him into my heart to take control of my life and thank you for that in Jesus name amen well if you pray to receive that prayer we'd love to hear from you give us a call or write us here at the Bible hour in a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of lessons out assurance or the booklet entitled fun is contagious you can also receive a cassette copy of today's message your gift of three dollars will help to fray the cost of providing the state the financial gifts from the Bible hour Founders Club help support this
