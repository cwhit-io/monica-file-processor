[time=0] The Lord and myself both know what the truth is.
[time=11] I did not have anything to do with the abduction of my children.
[time=19] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=30] We're glad you've joined us today.
[time=32] Why do people lie?
[time=34] Why do we do one thing now, or say one thing now, and then later deny that we ever did
[time=40] it, or do our best to cover the fact that we did it?
[time=44] Why did King David try to cover his adultery?
[time=46] Why did Peter lie about knowing Christ?
[time=50] More importantly, how can we start telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, all the time?
[time=57] Well stay with us today as Pastor Moore speaks to these issues in our continued study of the book of James.
[time=64] But right now let's begin with a sanctuary and children's choirs as they sing "Let His Children Rejoice!" "Let His Children rejoice for He is Lord of Creation. Let His Children
[time=85] rejoice and sing a song of salvation. Let His Children rejoice for He is Lord of Creation.
[time=98] Let His Children rejoice and sing a song of salvation.
[time=102] Oh, pray in His name, lift up His praise, make a joy for Lord, hallelujah, and all
[time=116] His children rejoice.
[time=118] Oh, take and see that the Lord is good, and peace upon His Word.
[time=126] Tell of His wonders, and all the earth will let His name be heard."
[time=137] "Let His Children rejoice for He is Lord of Creation. Let His Children rejoice and
[time=162] sing a song of salvation." Oh, pray in His name, lift up His praise, make a joy for Lord, hallelujah, and all
[time=177] His children rejoice and the fountains cry, "Hallelujah, and their child."
[time=188] "Hallelujah, and their children rejoice and sing a song of salvation."
[time=198] Oh, pray in His name, lift up His praise, make a joy for Lord, hallelujah, and all
[time=214] His children rejoice and sing "Let His Children rejoice and sing a song of salvation."
[time=227] "Let His Children rejoice and sing a song of salvation."
[time=299] Hi, my name is Russell Moore, and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour, and thank
[time=306] you for tuning in today.
[time=308] We're excited about what God is doing in this Christmas season, and as you know, Black Hawk Baptist Church hosts the Living Christmas Tree every year now for so many years, and we'll have nearly 20,000 people joining us again this year to celebrate the Living Christmas Tree.
[time=323] And unfortunately, all of our free tickets have been picked up already.
[time=328] I mean, they just disappear almost instantly.
[time=330] The very day that we opened them up to the public, they're gone within three or four hours.
[time=335] In fact, the ticket booth didn't even open on Saturday until 9 a.m.
[time=341] We had one lady here waiting at 4.20 a.m. in the cold, so she could be first in line.
[time=346] And so, unfortunately, the vast majority of our 20,000 tickets are already distributed, the free tickets.
[time=353] But what we do have is our premiere night, which is December 8th, and that's a special fundraising night for our Christian school.
[time=360] That's the only night that we charge for tickets.
[time=362] All the other 10 performances are free, but on this night's December 8th, there are tickets
[time=368] available, wonderful seats for $5 each.
[time=370] And so if you and your family missed the opportunity to find the free tickets or to avail yourself
[time=376] of that, we want you to know you can call us here at Black Hawk Baptist Church, and you can join us for our premiere night, December 8th, and those seats are $5 each, and we'll have a wonderful evening together celebrating the joy of Christmas.
[time=389] Also, I want you to know about our Christmas Eve service, December 24th, at 6 o'clock.
[time=394] It's a wonderful time together.
[time=396] We gather as a church family, and we like to invite Christians even from other churches who may not be hosting a program that night.
[time=403] If you'd like to join us, you're more than welcome to do that.
[time=406] It's a candlelit service at 6 o'clock on Christmas Eve.
[time=410] We'll be sharing some Christmas carols together and then taking communion.
[time=415] And if you're a born-again believer, even though you're not a member of our church, if you know Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, the Lord's Table is open to you as well.
[time=424] And the whole service just runs an hour, and it's a wonderful time to celebrate the birth of Christ.
[time=429] I know many of the families in our church then go home and have their special Christmas Eve dinner and then start on with their Christmas celebrations.
[time=436] And so you're welcome to join us for that.
[time=438] Also, then on Christmas Day, which happens to come on a Sunday this year, we're going to hold a special birthday party for Jesus Christ.
[time=445] It'll just be an hour in length.
[time=447] It'll start at 1045 on Christmas Day.
[time=450] It'll be very informal, kind of a come as you are.
[time=452] Now, I don't mean that you come in your bathrobe and slippers, but a shirt and sweater, no
[time=458] ties, just a very casual Sunday morning experience as we celebrate the birth of Christ.
[time=464] It'll be a family program.
[time=466] There will not be any children's programs, sunny schools, that is, that day.
[time=470] In fact, we'll have all of our kids in the service with us.
[time=474] We'll be doing some special songs for them.
[time=476] We're hoping a puppet show for them as well, maybe a drama, a brief message, just a way to spend some time together on Christmas morning as a family.
[time=485] Again, a very, very brief service, an hour long starting at 1045, and you're welcome to come to that as well if your church isn't already having a service.
[time=494] So we're excited about our Christmas season and all that God gives us in the gift of Jesus Christ.
[time=500] We're thankful for the privilege to share those services with you.
[time=503] And I might add how thankful we are for all of you who support the Bible Hour on a regular basis.
[time=508] We're coming out of the year-end, and I know we've expressed a need for you to support, help support this ministry, and we trust that as God allows you to do that, you'll be generous and your offerings and your ties to help support the Bible Hour.
[time=523] Well, I trust that God is doing great things in your life, that you're sensing His power and His presence in your daily walk with Him.
[time=531] And as we go now to the regularly scheduled portion of our Bible Hour service, we have a message about walking and honesty and truthfulness before God and before others.
[time=541] Stay with us, Lord Jesus.
[time=567] We are now in the morning of our Bible Hour. We are now in the morning of our Bible Hour.
[time=590] But we've been given so much more than we deserve, a home in heaven, after living
[time=610] here on earth, and of His passion, is to save us here and to save with our lives.
[time=622] How can we stand quietly, boy, when our own designs have fit to set us firm, and we've
[time=636] paid the price for Him in our lives, we need a good night, the truth in one day, we chose
[time=651] to stand quietly, but we've been given so much more than we deserve, a home in heaven,
[time=665] after living here on earth, and of His passion, is to save us here and to save with our lives.
[time=679] How can we stand quietly, boy, when the time is right, creation will reply and our minds
[time=698] will try to comprehend the signs of the risen Christ, in glory lifted high, we will not
[time=710] stand quietly, but we'll never again stand quietly, boy.
[time=740] I know right, I know right here what the truth is.
[time=755] The Lord and myself both know what the truth is.
[time=761] I did not have anything to do with the abduction of my children.
[time=772] So said Susan Smith, October 25th, after she had taken little Michael and little Alex and
[time=783] strapped them into the back of her car and drove around for a little while and finally
[time=790] came to a lake where there was a boat ramp, don't know how long she lingered, don't know
[time=798] exactly what she was thinking, but at some point she released the car into the water
[time=805] and walked away, but she did not want to have to deal with the consequences, and so
[time=813] she thought that she could somehow change the situation by lying, that somehow there would
[time=822] be a way that if she could just lie convincingly enough and even call upon God or the Lord
[time=828] and touch her heart and say with very convincing words, I did not have anything to do with
[time=838] the abduction of my children that somehow things could be different than they really were.
[time=851] There's another person that lied a lot like Susan, only he did it a couple thousand years
[time=857] ago.
[time=858] He was standing in a courtyard and his very, very good friend was on trial.
[time=867] And some of the people there said, "Now, you're a good friend of his.
[time=870] I mean, you know him, don't you?" And the individual said, "Actually, he began to curse and to swear," the Bible says in
[time=879] Mark 14, and cursed doesn't mean he started using swear words of some kind.
[time=884] It means that he was calling anathema upon himself, curse himself, if what he was about to say wasn't truly true, he began to curse and swear, which would be to make oaths, which were very typical for that Jewish culture in that day.
[time=897] And then he said and I quote, "I do not know this man you are talking about."
[time=907] You see, Peter didn't want to be identified with Christ.
[time=911] Peter didn't want to have to take the consequences of being identified with Christ and he thought that if he could just lie convincingly enough and even bring oaths and by swearing that he
[time=924] could then convince the people that he really hadn't been the closest of all of the Lord's
[time=931] earthly friends, that somehow he could change things and he wouldn't have to face the reality
[time=937] of the situation.
[time=941] King David believed the same lie, that if he could just lie, if he could just cover it up, then somehow maybe it will be as if I didn't do it.
[time=952] And so after having committing adultery with Bathsheba, he brought her husband home from the battlefield and tried to deceive the man into sleeping with his wife, but of course the man had too much integrity and too much purity of his own heart to have that kind of pleasure within comrades were still out on the battlefield so he slept on the step instead.
[time=972] Not only frustrated things, but David was still really convinced if he could just cover this up, then things could be genuinely different and he wouldn't have to face the truth.
[time=984] And as you know, he sent Uriah back out in the battlefield with his own death orders
[time=990] and indirectly murdered the man.
[time=993] If you'd opened your Bible this morning to James chapter 5, the Lord wants to talk to
[time=999] us about lying.
[time=1004] And we're really just going to look at one verse because that's kind of how it got written.
[time=1009] I mean, this is the only verse in chapter 5 about lying and it's what's next in what we would study in the book of James.
[time=1017] And what I want to do this morning is just explain this verse to you because I think it is subject to a great bit of misunderstanding and then try to apply the basic truth to our lives by asking and letting you answer two questions.
[time=1033] And so I hope you'll bring your life to this this morning.
[time=1038] It says in James 5, 12, "But above all my brethren, do not swear either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath.
[time=1046] But let your yes be yes and your no-no so that you may not fall under judgment."
[time=1052] What does that mean?
[time=1053] What is that really saying?
[time=1056] Well first of all, the word "swear" does not mean illicit speech or filthy communication or dirty talk or taking the Lord's name in vain.
[time=1064] Remember that James was written to a bunch of Jews who had made professions of faith in Christ and some of them really were Christians and others of them were just professing Christ.
[time=1073] But they carry with them all of their Jewish traditions.
[time=1076] And it was very common and very traditional for Jews to try to in fact the word oath means to strengthen or to bind, to strengthen their own word by swearing by a higher power.
[time=1092] In other words, you bind or strengthen your own word by swearing by some higher authority.
[time=1097] It's as if to say, "You can believe me, you can believe I'm telling the truth because I will add strength to what I am saying." By saying as it says in verse 12, "I swear by heaven, or I swear by the power of earth,
[time=1111] or by some other oath that they might have taken." And in fact, the Jews were in the practice of swearing not just by heaven and earth, but if you would read Matthew 5 and Matthew 23, you'd discover that they would swear by Jerusalem, the holy city, they would swear by the temple, the holy place in the holy city, they would swear by the temple in the, excuse me, by the gold inside the temple, and of course the
[time=1136] gold being the very pure thing inside the very pure temple inside the very pure city.
[time=1141] They would swear by the altar, they would swear by the offering on the altar, the very thing that was being offered to God.
[time=1149] But they believed, and in fact were taught by their religious leaders, that unless they
[time=1155] used God in their swearing, unless they brought God into the picture, then they weren't really
[time=1161] obligated to keep the promise.
[time=1164] It's kind of like that juvenile thing we did as kids when we crossed our fingers and had them behind our backs, and your sister said, "Do you promise to trade me this for that?"
[time=1174] And you say, "I promise." But you had your fingers crossed.
[time=1181] So in your mind, you didn't think you were really obligated to fulfill your promise.
[time=1185] And if it was like, it was in your house like it was in my house, we would always check before we would accept that promise.
[time=1190] Let me see your hands, let me see your fingers.
[time=1193] I got her once really good, man.
[time=1195] She had me out there.
[time=1196] Nothing was crossed.
[time=1197] I made the promise.
[time=1198] I said, "Yeah, but my hairs were crossed." It's just that juvenile.
[time=1205] In one sense, it's just that juvenile what's going on here in James chapter 5.
[time=1210] And in another way, it is incredibly corrupt, and it reveals a very corrupt hypocritical
[time=1216] heart because what these people wanted to do was they wanted to believe and present themselves
[time=1222] as God-fearing religious folk, trustable, believable people that you could count on.
[time=1228] They didn't really want to come out and just boldly lie, and so they swore by everything but God and then left themselves in that swearing both the impression of religious devotion
[time=1240] and integrity and left themselves, at least in their own minds, the prerogative not to
[time=1246] keep their word, the prerogative not to do as they said they would do.
[time=1254] So the question is, is it right or is it wrong to swear?
[time=1257] I mean, for us, what is this verse saying to us?
[time=1260] Is it right or wrong to swear?
[time=1261] Is it right or wrong to take an oath?
[time=1264] In taking an oath that includes God, you're basically saying, "I am telling the truth.
[time=1268] I want God to witness that I am telling the truth, and if I'm not telling the truth, I want God to punish me for such falsehood." Is that acceptable for a Christian to do?
[time=1278] Is this verse prohibiting that?
[time=1280] Well, you might be interested to know that swearing by God is in fact not unbiblical.
[time=1287] It is not wrong for us.
[time=1290] Abraham did it in Genesis 24, he swore before God.
[time=1293] Isaac did the same thing in Genesis 26.
[time=1299] In 2 Samuel 19, David swore before God.
[time=1302] In 2 Chronicles 15, Israel, the entire nation as a people, took a vow before God.
[time=1307] You say, "What about us in the New Testament?" Well, Paul in 2 Corinthians 1, 23 said this, "Listen, but I call God as witness to my
[time=1318] soul that to spare you, I came no more to Corinth." The question is, why haven't you been here?
[time=1324] Why haven't you showed up?
[time=1326] And Paul says, "Listen, you can believe me.
[time=1327] I call God as my witness to my soul." Here's the reason I didn't come, it was to spare you.
[time=1336] He says in 2 Corinthians 11, 31, "The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever knows that I am not lying." That's not unbiblical.
[time=1348] It's not wrong to say, "I'm telling you the truth, and by God you can believe me that I'm telling the truth." I swear before God that what I am saying to you is true.
[time=1358] In fact, God Himself swore by Himself in Hebrews, chapter 6 verse 13 when He said, "For when
[time=1367] God made the promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater," see, He is
[time=1373] the greatest.
[time=1374] So who does He swear by?
[time=1375] I mean, who does He bind or strengthen Himself to?
[time=1377] Well, Himself.
[time=1378] And so He says, "He swore by Himself when God made the promise to Abraham, since He could
[time=1384] swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself." So the Bible doesn't condemn nor does it prohibit taking a vow or making an oath in the name of God.
[time=1394] And by that, acknowledging His witness and seeking His help and even His punishment should you fail to complete it.
[time=1402] And when you are in a courtroom and they ask you to take the stand and swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to help you God, you are not violating James 5, 12, or any other biblical principle.
[time=1414] And when you stand at the altar and you're about ready to make a life vow to a person you're going to spend the rest of your life with, and you say, "I promised before God and these witnesses to be your loving and faithful husband in plenty and in want in sickness and in health, in joy and in sorrow as long as we both shall live," you are not breaking, you are in fact following a biblical pattern that at solemn moments when there is high,
[time=1439] high stakes and you want to help people understand just how intensely serious you are about the
[time=1446] issue to call upon God as your witness.
[time=1451] What James is after here is this ridiculous, juvenile religious system of lying and hypocrisy
[time=1458] and pretense, where they would pray or rather make a vow by heaven, earth, Jerusalem, the
[time=1464] temple, the gold in the temple, the altar, the offering on the altar, and as long as they didn't mention God in the oath itself they felt that they were exempt.
[time=1474] And God says that's lying, I mean that's got to stop, that is, that is got to stop.
[time=1482] In fact their own Mishnah, which was the oral traditions, not the word of God, but the Mishnah,
[time=1488] the oral traditions that the religious leaders published, had in it that if you failed to
[time=1494] oath or swear by God himself you were exempt from your oath.
[time=1499] And God condemns that as a false religious system, as a Pharisaical self-righteousness,
[time=1507] to give, to be in an effort to give the appearance of being truthful while at the same time lying and leaving away of escape.
[time=1515] And as you might expect when Jesus came, both in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5 and
[time=1521] later in Matthew 23 he condemned this entire system and called them fools.
[time=1526] He said, you foolish people, how can you vow by earth and not think you vowed by me because I made the earth?
[time=1533] How can you think you can vow by heaven and not vow by me because I made the heavens?
[time=1539] You can't vow by anything and not vow by me and just shut the door on the whole system
[time=1545] of lying and just exposed it for what it was.
[time=1549] So he says stop lying, then he says start doing this, look at verse 12 again, tell the truth, what do you mean by that?
[time=1555] Just let your yes be yes and your no no so that you may not fall under judgment.
[time=1560] And he's not saying that you can only say yes to a promise, that all the only response you can give to someone is yes.
[time=1566] What he is saying is that you need to be a truthful person, you need to be a person of integrity, someone who has placed such a high priority on being truthful.
[time=1576] That for you to bind yourself to some commitment, all it takes is one word yes or one word no
[time=1585] and it's done because you are so full of integrity and a commitment to truth and character that
[time=1592] you don't need a bunch of trappings to bind you to your word, just one word is good.
[time=1599] Just one word and you're bound, not because of the length of the words or the content of the words or the way they're said because of who you are.
[time=1610] You give your word it's done and you can give it in the shortest possible way and it says binding as the longest possible way, yes or no discussions over.
[time=1620] You don't need to say I promise, you don't need to say I swear, you don't have to say I cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye, if I don't do this you don't have to do anything.
[time=1628] You just say you got it, will you do this for me, yes.
[time=1634] Would you ever do this, no.
[time=1637] And the whole thing is settled, such a profound commitment to the truth in your life that the
[time=1643] most simple rudimentary one word answer is all that is needed to unequivocally bind you
[time=1649] to the deal and that same one word answer is enough to put the one you are giving your
[time=1655] word to at total peace because they know you.
[time=1660] So he's saying stop, stop this hocus pocus Mickey Mouse oath making stuff which is nothing
[time=1666] but a pretense for your warped character, your desire not to keep your word, your desire
[time=1672] to be able to appear religious and actually be something else, just be a truthful person.
[time=1678] Okay, that's basically what I think that verse means.
[time=1682] Now let's go to our questions that I hope will make this relevant because you know a lot of us aren't into oath taking and we weren't raised in Jewish traditions but the principles are profound for us.
[time=1695] Question number one, why do we lie?
[time=1700] Why do we lie?
[time=1701] Why do people lie?
[time=1704] Why do people lie because they want to avoid the consequences of their behavior?
[time=1708] Somehow David thought if he could just cover up what he had done with Bathsheba then it's as if it wouldn't have happened which is just absolutely foolish isn't it?
[time=1719] Because it did happen and nothing he can do will undo what happened, it happened, it's
[time=1726] called reality, it's in the past tense, it's there and no lie and no system of lies will
[time=1732] ever undo what was done.
[time=1735] Peter thought if he could just cover up the fact that he had been one of Christ's closest disciples then he could avoid the consequences.
[time=1742] In other words, people lie because they don't want to face the discomfort and the pain of reality and they think they can create their own reality through their lies and they don't.
[time=1758] Let me put it to you this way.
[time=1760] You can never avoid the consequences of your behaviors.
[time=1766] You can, lies will never let you out of the consequences of your behavior.
[time=1770] Now in a certain sense it does, I mean if Susan Smith, this woman that murdered her children, I mean if she could have been a little better at what she did and came up with a little better alibi and had been a little more sensitive to what detectives are thinking when they ask people questions and I think she was like putty in their hands.
[time=1786] I think they figure her out pretty quick.
[time=1788] But if she had been better, yes there's a sense in which she wouldn't be known now as the one who murdered her children and she might be able to live the rest of her life without ever having to be known as that and having, so there's a sense in which you could avoid some of the consequences but I want to suggest to you that those are the minor consequences.
[time=1807] Let me give you the three consequences that you can never avoid that are really the major league consequences for behavior.
[time=1813] Number one, you forfeit your peace with God.
[time=1819] You forfeit your peace with God, Christian and unchristian alike.
[time=1822] It's weird how this works, but when you begin to lie and you don't tell the truth, you forfeit
[time=1829] your internal sense of well-being.
[time=1832] Listen to the words of David, after he had lied and tried to cover up for over a year he said this, "When I kept silent about my sin," in other words, "when I refused to tell the truth about me and what I'd done to Bathsheba and to Uriah and how I had even used my own
[time=1848] military men," and other men had fallen in my little plot.
[time=1854] Before his really standing up to the table and taking full responsibility for what he had done and when he was still in this deceptive lying mode, he said this, "When I kept silent about my sin, my body wasted away." I mean, it just racked me physically, I began to lose my strength.
[time=1874] He goes on to say, "Through my groaning all day long, why, for day and night thy hand
[time=1882] was heavy upon me and my vitality was drained away as with the fervor heat of summer." It's unbelievable what God does to liars, people who are not willing to face the truth.
[time=1895] He brings his heavy hand into their life and I don't know how to describe that other than if you felt it, you know it.
[time=1902] And it's this oppressive thing that steals your joy and saps your vitality and makes
[time=1908] you feel like you've gone from tetna color just to this sappy white existence and there's
[time=1914] just nothing to it.
[time=1915] The color is gone.
[time=1917] The vitality is no longer there.
[time=1919] Things that used to bring joy don't bring joy.
[time=1921] Things that used to make you happy don't make you happy.
[time=1925] There's a groaning that you carry around all day long.
[time=1930] It's the hand of God.
[time=1932] And in the unbeliever's life, when he places this kind of pressure in their life, really,
[time=1938] the unbeliever and the believer are both subject to this, that becomes so hard to endure
[time=1944] and so difficult that we become vulnerable to all kinds of escapism type sins.
[time=1951] And people run into alcohol and people run into pornography and people run into workaholism and people run into spending sprees and just the myriad of things that try to release them
[time=1966] from the pressure of God's hand and that that hound dog sense that God is not pleased
[time=1972] with my life.
[time=1973] I am living a lie.
[time=1974] I am a liar.
[time=1975] I am not truthful.
[time=1977] They just run a thousand different directions and then of course those things themselves keep more pressure upon their life.
[time=1988] You know people in the unsaved world who are suffering under this kind of pressure and
[time=1995] who are systematically tearing their lives apart because they will not square up with
[time=2001] God and tell the truth.
[time=2009] The second thing, the second consequence that you can never avoid when you lie, saved or
[time=2017] unsaved, is you give away a piece of the most important thing you have and that's called your character.
[time=2025] A person who is walking in the truth has character, now whatever that is, there's something that makes them whole inside and every time they tell a lie, it's as if they reach in, the
[time=2037] nose really doesn't grow, you reach in and you give over and you tear out of yourself
[time=2044] a part of the most valuable thing you own which is your character.
[time=2047] It's more valuable to you than your gifts and your talents and your money and your house and your kids and your wife and anything you have, the most valuable thing you have, humanly speaking is your character, your integrity and those two things working in concert, God's
[time=2065] oppressive hands, stealing your vitality and bearing down upon you because you're not walking in truth and the own self-destructive pattern of giving your character away where you are
[time=2076] no longer whole and you have this impoverished little soul inside of you that you have compromised
[time=2082] repeatedly by your lying and by your falsehoods and life is pretty doggone miserable.
[time=2091] And it doesn't seem there's any place to run and there's no place to hide and you don't
[time=2097] like yourself and you don't like your life.
[time=2102] Those are consequences that are unavoidable.
[time=2103] You might fool the jury, you might fool the detectives that you might get away with it
[time=2111] but you never escape these two things.
[time=2114] In Romans chapter 1, speaking about the forfeiting of your character, you have some people there
[time=2120] and Romans 1 describes this kind of free fall into immorality and these people are moving
[time=2126] from basically normal people into all kinds of heterosexual activity and then homosexual
[time=2132] activity and they end up at the end of the chapter in just this wanton wild abandonment to immorality, every conceivable kind of sin is listed there.
[time=2142] And there's an interesting sequence that occurs, it begins at the beginning of the chapter because these people do something with the truth, they suppress it, they don't say it
[time=2153] isn't true, they don't write arguments against it, they just do one simple thing, they just suppress it which means they refuse to allow it to have its full impact on their life.
[time=2164] A couple verses later it says that they exchange the truth of God for a lie, you see, they're
[time=2171] beginning to give parts of their character away and what they wouldn't do at the beginning of the chapter they just, they will admit it's true they just suppress it by a few verses later and as it describes the course of their life now they're ready to give the truth up completely exchange for a lie, they want to believe a lie.
[time=2190] And by the end of the chapter it says they give hearty approval to the deeds of darkness.
[time=2197] I mean what you're seeing here is someone move from having some level of character because they refuse to honor God's truth in their life to giving the truth away exchanging it and now they can really genuinely get excited about the sick things that happen in the world.
[time=2214] There are some who would applaud what this Susan Smith did, yes, hearty approval.
[time=2223] When you play fast and lose with the truth there are certain unavoidable, unescapable
[time=2230] consequences that come into your life.
[time=2235] You forfeit your peace, your internal well-being, you give away your character and the third one is found here in James at the end of the verse.
[time=2244] Look at it there in James 5.12 see what it says.
[time=2248] Let your yes be yes and you know be no so that you may not fall under judgment.
[time=2252] Now the word judgment here is not the kind I've been talking about for the believer where God disciplines.
[time=2258] The word judgment, the Greek word is never used in the New Testament to refer to God's discipline on a believer.
[time=2264] This is the word that's used exclusively in connection with the judgment of hell.
[time=2269] And you say, I don't understand, these are brethren, look at the beginning of verse 12.
[time=2273] Above all my brethren, these are people who have named the name of Christ and what James is saying is if you have as the habitual pattern of your life a lying heart, not that you struggle
[time=2285] with it from time to time and you repent of it, but that is the way with you.
[time=2289] You are a liar, then it doesn't matter about your profession of faith, you're obviously
[time=2295] not born again because born again people don't lie on a regular basis.
[time=2298] They may struggle but they repent.
[time=2301] And so he's saying, understand this very clearly.
[time=2304] If swearing by heaven and earth or any other oath or any other form of lying is your pattern of life and you delight in the law and you live by the lie, if you delight in the lie
[time=2315] and live by the lie, time out, it reveals you're not truly born again.
[time=2326] And you may escape the earthly courtroom but you will never escape the heavenly courtroom and the verdict is nothing but judgment.
[time=2338] Why do people lie?
[time=2339] Well they want to avoid the consequences and you see in reality we're willing to settle for a counterfeit comfort.
[time=2346] We're willing to settle for a facade that we really didn't do something and we think
[time=2352] if we can just fool people that we didn't do it then it's as if we didn't do it.
[time=2357] But the word of God goes right through that and says no let's be careful here if you really want to avoid consequences tell the truth.
[time=2367] Offer the hardship in the short term and know the blessed hand of God in the long term.
[time=2373] Have your character in the long term and avoid the judgment of God in the long term.
[time=2382] The second question I wanted to ask was how do you stop lying?
[time=2388] Let me say it to you this way.
[time=2391] The face the truth may be the single most important aspect of continued growth in your
[time=2397] Christian life.
[time=2401] Some of us here today have played a little fast and loose with the truth.
[time=2406] Some of us are lying to ourselves and we're lying to God and we're lying to our spouses and we're lying to our children and we're lying to our friends.
[time=2414] That is true.
[time=2415] Some of us are doing that and I'll bet to a person that you can testify that your Christian
[time=2423] growth has plateaued, that you have stopped growing as you have started playing fast and
[time=2430] loose with the truth, the little white lies, the little things that you think are better left unsaid because you don't want to hurt somebody by telling what you really did.
[time=2439] There is a dynamic relationship between telling the truth and facing the truth and growing in your Christian life.
[time=2446] This has illustrated to me this week so powerfully I had the privilege of meeting as I do on a weekly basis with a couple of people who are new to the Lord that I've been discipling for the last several years and I was just floored by their growth rate.
[time=2459] I mean they are growing so fast it brought me to a point of conviction where I'm saying God how come I'm not growing as fast and I know there are stages and there's growth spurts but if you've ever been in this situation and the common denominator is that they are willing to be honest about what is really going on in their life.
[time=2478] You see they're so new to the Lord that they don't have any false Christian maturity pretense stuff, no masks on.
[time=2484] I mean the whole point of coming to the Lord was that they were sinners and they wanted to change and they're so new in the process that they're still really free to tell you how sinful they are.
[time=2495] And in being that honest and in being that open they just open their lives up for incredible
[time=2501] growth rates and to make huge strides.
[time=2505] When you stop being vitally honest with God and with people in your life you stunt your growth you hit a plateau you back the thing up.
[time=2515] And I wish those of you maybe who are here this morning who know exactly what I'm talking about could stand up here and give testimony to that.
[time=2526] We started lying to God, to a spouse, to a parent, to a child, to a friend.
[time=2534] We've backed away from certain parts of our life to being really honest with certain parts of our life because we don't want to go through the sacrifice of giving that thing up.
[time=2543] We don't want the discomfort that it brings telling the truth about that issue.
[time=2548] We don't want to have to make the commitment that represents following through on truth-telling.
[time=2552] We don't want to spend the time, we don't want to have the exposure, we don't want to be humbled, we don't want to take the risks of being honest.
[time=2560] We substitute a counterfeit peace or a counterfeit reality for truth and it never works.
[time=2571] It didn't work for David, it didn't work for Peter, it didn't work for Susan Smith.
[time=2581] In other words, in order for David to really stop lying there had to be a point at which he would again acknowledge the truth and that was a hard process for him.
[time=2589] There was a lot of discomfort right there, remember?
[time=2592] He went for a year lying about the whole thing and eventually God sent the prophet Nathan into the courtroom and Nathan told him this parable, that paralleled what he had done with Bathsheba and her husband.
[time=2606] David didn't get the connection right at first because he was just listening to the parable and there was this mean man in the parable who had killed somebody and taken the one little U lamb and David said that man should be put to death.
[time=2621] He still knew truth, he just wasn't willing to say truth about himself and the prophet said that's you, you're the man, you're the one.
[time=2631] It was very uncomfortable, it was very exposing, David didn't like it a bit.
[time=2641] Peter had to be restored from his lie and that was a very awkward situation.
[time=2645] Peter had lied, the Lord had been crucified, the Lord had been risen again, the Lord made breakfast for the guys, showed his love and his tenderness to them and then he singled
[time=2654] Peter out.
[time=2656] See Peter had boasted that he was so loyal, that he loved Christ so much that though the
[time=2662] whole world did I, not me, and then of course he denied the Lord.
[time=2670] And the Lord knew that for Peter to go on and to have a productive life there had to be a day of reckoning, there had to be a point of repentance.
[time=2676] Peter couldn't just continue to sweep the thing under the rug and pretend that it hadn't because it had exist and until he was willing to acknowledge what he had done there was no food for him in ministry.
[time=2687] And the Lord was not gentle, I mean he was gentle but man was he poignant.
[time=2691] He didn't say did you lie, he didn't say did you overstep you're boasting there a little bit and think more highly of yourself than you should have thought, that was also true.
[time=2699] He did lie and he did boast but man the Lord goes right to the crux of the matter and says do you love me, do you love me, why?
[time=2708] Because if Peter had really loved him as much as he said he loved him he never would have denied him.
[time=2713] I mean the Lord didn't just confront the lying, the Lord can confront the condition of the
[time=2719] guys heart to really restore him back to a place of wholeness where he could have his character back.
[time=2727] There are no shortcuts, what I'm trying to say is there are no shortcuts.
[time=2731] If you're carrying around a lie and you think that because you successfully covered it up
[time=2740] that you can continue to live with it, you're foolish.
[time=2745] You need to confess it to God and you need to confess it to some people, you need to come clean, you need to go through the very uncomfortable process and maybe even suffer through the consequences of coming clean.
[time=2758] And that'll be hard and it'll be painful.
[time=2765] But look at what God went on to do with David and Peter and this he'll do with you I promise.
[time=2770] Is it worth it?
[time=2771] Yes, watch.
[time=2773] When David came clean God then went on to fill his heart with joy again.
[time=2779] God took away the hand that stole his vitality.
[time=2782] God took away that stuff that felt like the heat of summer.
[time=2785] And God filled the man's soul once again with a sense of God loves me, I'm okay, I'm right
[time=2791] with God, things are right in my life and I can live again.
[time=2796] Even though he committed adultery and murdered and tried to hide it up for a year at the moment of his conversion, God floods his life, not his conversion but his repentance.
[time=2806] God floods his life with his joy all over again.
[time=2810] David did the same thing for Peter.
[time=2813] Peter did the paramount thing, I mean not a lot of us get to be that close to the Lord and not a lot of us then get to have that point of great betrayal.
[time=2821] And as heinous as that was and as shameful as that was when Peter finally faced up to that truth in his life, confessed it and dealt with it, God filled his life with joy.
[time=2832] Give him a second win and God will do that with you.
[time=2838] If you will square up with God and be honest about what you're lying about, God will not punish you my friend, God will bless you.
[time=2848] God will fill your heart back up again.
[time=2850] God will take away that ominous presence of heaviness from your life.
[time=2857] And the other thing that God did with both David and Peter, after they faced the truth,
[time=2863] God went on to use them in incredible ways, right?
[time=2866] Peter wasn't done.
[time=2867] David didn't come to the point where he told the truth there with Nathan in the throne room and then God said that's it, I'm done with you, you're out of here.
[time=2872] You finally told the truth and now you're out of here.
[time=2876] Absolutely not.
[time=2877] Some of David's most fruitful writings and productive years were after that occurred.
[time=2883] Look at Peter's life.
[time=2885] Peter didn't even get in the game until after he confessed that stuff with the Lord and John, at the end of the Gospel of John.
[time=2892] The greatest portion of Peter's life and ministry happened after he had failed so miserably,
[time=2898] lied so completely and finally squared the truth and God not only gave him his joy back but he went on to use them in an incredible way, God will do that for you too.
[time=2906] I have found that when people get truthful about their lives and they don't cover it up and they take the consequences and they let it re-establish their character, that that is when their ministry really begins.
[time=2920] You may have reached some point in your Christian life and you may have fallen backwards due to some lie in your life due to some falsehood and you may be thinking that's it.
[time=2930] I was here.
[time=2931] I'm now here.
[time=2932] God will never use me again and I'm telling you based on God's word that just isn't true.
[time=2936] You just need to trust him.
[time=2939] You just need to trust him and tell him the truth.
[time=2943] The joy comes back and the usefulness multiplies.
[time=2950] Let me close with three suggestions, very practical suggestions.
[time=2956] Number one, ask yourself this question.
[time=2959] How truthful am I being in my relationship with God?
[time=2964] Just find a moment sometime today and ask yourself this question.
[time=2967] How truthful am I being in my relationship with God?
[time=2970] Let me flush it out.
[time=2974] Is the Holy Spirit leading you to do something?
[time=2980] And you know he's leading you to do something.
[time=2983] Maybe it's to give something, maybe it's to go somewhere, maybe it's to seek someone out.
[time=2988] Whatever it is, is he leading you to do something and you know he's doing it but you're pretending that you don't know?
[time=2995] You're pretending it's something else other than what you know it is, the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3000] How truthful are you being in your relationship with God?
[time=3006] Maybe there's something the Holy Spirit is urging you to stop doing.
[time=3009] He wants you to stop something.
[time=3011] He wants you to end a particular relationship.
[time=3013] He wants you to stop a particular habit or a practice.
[time=3016] And you know it.
[time=3017] There's no question in your mind that it's God and he's asking you to stop it.
[time=3022] But you're pretending that you don't know.
[time=3026] You want to get a head start on this whole thing?
[time=3029] Give him that one thing today.
[time=3033] And you watch.
[time=3034] By the time you put your head on the pillow tonight, you're going to feel differently about yourself and about your God and about the people in your world.
[time=3045] Second suggestion, kind of a long term.
[time=3047] That's kind of an immediate thing.
[time=3048] Let me give you a long term kind of idea on getting more honest and more authentic in your life with God.
[time=3053] I want to invite you to try journaling, journaling.
[time=3057] I've only struggled with it myself.
[time=3059] I don't consider myself a great journaler.
[time=3061] I believe God's leading me in this direction.
[time=3063] I believe he wants me to move down this path because I think he wants me to be more honest with him than I have been in the past.
[time=3069] You say, "How do I journal?" Okay, here you go.
[time=3072] Get a spiral notebook.
[time=3075] Limit yourself to one page a day at the top of the page, put the word yesterday.
[time=3081] Just put the word yesterday at the top of the page.
[time=3084] Now you just take however much time and just write that one page out as you reflect on yesterday.
[time=3089] Your feelings, your attitudes, where you are servant, whatever God's laying on your heart.
[time=3093] How did you handle your money?
[time=3095] How were you at work?
[time=3097] Just take and fill up one page of reflection, honest reflection on yesterday.
[time=3105] And then set yourself a date, a week or two from now and go back and read it.
[time=3110] Say, "Okay, honest to God."
[time=3116] Make sure you find a safe place for that thing, right, or you won't be honest.
[time=3123] Try it.
[time=3126] One more suggestion.
[time=3128] This too is kind of a long-term thing.
[time=3131] I want to challenge you if you don't have a person in your life that you can tell everything
[time=3138] to.
[time=3142] Find them, right?
[time=3145] Go find them, build them, pray for them, seek them, and let that relationship begin because
[time=3152] I'll tell you what happens.
[time=3153] I've seen it in my own life and I've seen it in other people's lives.
[time=3156] At first it's a little bit surfy, everybody's scared, nobody really wants to open their
[time=3163] little window on their soul the first time, but eventually it starts to happen and people start to say what's really going on in their lives and all of a sudden you're starting
[time=3173] to tell the truth about you.
[time=3177] And a lot of times you're encouraged to do it because somebody else did it first.
[time=3183] We were not built to live in an isolated thing with you and God and the Holy Spirit.
[time=3188] That is not what the Bible talks about when it describes healthy Christian living.
[time=3192] It describes this intimate, personal, involved relationship with other people who can bear your burdens and how can they bear your burdens if they don't know what they are?
[time=3200] How can they bear your burdens if you don't have the courage and the context of love and support and wish to tell them what your burdens are?
[time=3207] You just, it's if you take a whole bunch of God's truth and lift it out of God's word when you try to live your Christian life all by yourself or with God and then the rest of us on a very superficial level.
[time=3218] It's not how the game was meant to be played.
[time=3224] You can tell them how you feel about God, how you feel about people, the temptations you're struggling with, the failures you're going through, the fears you're carrying around in your heart, the joys you're experiencing, what God is teaching you, what God is leading you to do.
[time=3238] Man, it's the greatest resource going, it's absolutely free.
[time=3243] Get some friends together, build a relationship and let God let you tell the truth.
[time=3251] Well, let's pray together, commit ourselves to truth-telling.
[time=3258] Lord, as I have spent this week with you and with this verse, you know you've put your
[time=3270] finger on a few things in my life that I've been pretending about.
[time=3277] I kind of knew you were talking to me, but I kind of pretended I didn't know, and I'm
[time=3283] so thankful for verses like this that just say, "Hey, what let's say we just stripped
[time=3289] the facade away and just be honest.
[time=3295] How about we just trust in a loving, sovereign God who knows everything about us anyway,
[time=3303] and be honest about who we are and what we're doing and those things that you want us to
[time=3309] change or stop or start or begin."
[time=3315] And Lord, you're so trustable, you are so faithful, you are so true to us, and I know
[time=3324] many of us fear that true honesty will unravel our lives, and it somehow will be so ugly
[time=3330] and unacceptable that you'll reject us and others will, and how is it that it's such
[time=3338] an opposite thing?
[time=3341] More honest we are with you, the more you love us, the more we feel your love, and the more honest we are with others, the more they love us, the more they move into our lives.
[time=3350] I pray for those who are here today, who are carrying some really dark secrets.
[time=3358] And man, you're thundering in their head right now.
[time=3362] You're pounding in their soul, and you're saying to them, "This was about you today.
[time=3368] This is your chance to start telling the truth, don't give this opportunity away.
[time=3376] Don't walk out these doors and let this chance go, make the resolution right now, then you're
[time=3382] going to deal with that secret.
[time=3383] You're going to deal with it with the help of other people for the glory of God, because
[time=3389] if you do, you know he's going to fill you with joy and he's going to begin to use you again in ways that will satisfy your soul.
[time=3401] We love you and praise you for your grace, God, that lets us tell the truth and not be absolutely destroyed, because the truth about us is so bad.
[time=3411] We love you and praise you in Christ's name, amen.
[time=3421] Well being truthful with yourself and truthful with God about your spiritual condition is probably the most important thing you can do, and maybe you've never prayed to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior to be forgiven, to be given eternal life, and God's talking to you right now, and he wants you to do that, and you want to do that, and you want to be free from the penalty and the consequences of your own sin.
[time=3442] Why don't you bow your head and pray with me, and I'll lead you in a prayer of accepting Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3449] Let's pray together.
[time=3450] Father, I know that I need to be truthful with you and admit my own sin, admit how I
[time=3456] have fallen short, admit that I don't deserve heaven and that there's nothing I could ever do to earn or to deserve heaven, to acknowledge the truth that Jesus Christ died on the cross
[time=3468] from my sins and that I need to accept Him as my Savior, and I do that right now.
[time=3473] Accept Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Savior, and I thank you for the forgiveness and the eternal life that comes with that faith decision.
[time=3481] I pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3484] Well if you just prayed right now to accept Christ as your Savior, we'd love to know about it.
[time=3489] And let us know.
