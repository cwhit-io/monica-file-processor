[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=9] of Black Hog Baptist Church.
[time=11] We're glad you've joined us today.
[time=13] Have you ever been so tired spiritually that you just wanted to give up so weak, so exhausted and overwhelmed that you didn't even feel the spiritual strength to pray for yourself?
[time=25] What are you supposed to do when you hit rock bottom like that?
[time=28] Well, stay with us today as Pastor Moore answers these questions through our study in the book of James.
[time=34] But first, let's join our sanctuary choir as they sing his word, "We'll Stand." (upbeat music)

[time=262] [MUSIC - 281 seconds]
[time=554] (audience applauds)
[time=568] - Well, let me invite you to take your Bibles
[time=574] and come to James chapter five this morning.
[time=576] We're nearing the end of our study of this book.
[time=578] And we come to a very, very interesting set of verses.
[time=583] I do encourage you to take your Bible out and look carefully.
[time=587] Much of what we'll do today is a Bible study of sorts.
[time=590] Very, very interesting few verses.
[time=593] Let me begin in verses 14 and 15.
[time=596] Says there is anyone among you sick.
[time=598] Let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him, and anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
[time=607] And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up.
[time=616] And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
[time=621] Let me ask you a question.
[time=625] Do you believe that?
[time=626] Do you believe that if a person is physically sick,
[time=634] maybe they have cancer, maybe they have a bad heart and they're about to die, maybe they have pneumonia, maybe they have any number of things.
[time=641] When they are physically sick, do you believe that what these verses are saying is that they need to call the elders of the church.
[time=648] The elders come, the elders anoint the person with oil, the elders pray, and if the elders have offered their prayer in faith and then implied at the end of verse 15, if the sick person has confessed any sins that they might have committed, do you believe that God is obligating himself to heal that person 100% of the time?
[time=669] I mean, that is a promise, you know.
[time=671] It does say if you'll call the elders, they'll anoint with oil, then verse 15, the promise.
[time=675] And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up.
[time=682] Do you believe that?
[time=687] I don't, I don't believe that, never have.
[time=693] I have no problem with verse 14.
[time=698] Is anyone among you sick?
[time=699] If you're physically sick and you want somebody to pray for you, the elders are as good as anybody, call them.
[time=703] If they want to anoint you with oil, that's all fine.
[time=705] Verse 15 is a place where I bail out.
[time=710] Where it makes this promise, conditional as it may be, but a promise that the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up.
[time=719] And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him.
[time=722] In other words, do you believe that it is God's will
[time=728] for every single Christian to have a perfect bill of health all the time that a Christian should never be sick?
[time=735] In fact, a Christian should never die of sickness and to ensure that the Christian is never sick or never dying of sickness, that then this is a formula that is given to us.
[time=747] And if we can just offer the prayer in faith, as it says in verse 15, and if the sick person has sins, if they'll just honestly confess them, confess them, that then that God is obligated and it is his will to heal that person or persons every single time.
[time=765] 'Cause that's what that implies, right?
[time=770] I mean, it implies that God wants every Christian healthy and the only issue left is whether the elders can pray the right way and whether the sick person can confess the right way, but the underlying assumption is that God wants every Christian healthy all the time.
[time=783] And I don't believe that.
[time=785] I don't believe that's taught anywhere in the word of God.
[time=788] In fact, for example, if you were to turn, you don't need to, 2 Corinthians 12, Paul is suffering with some type of physical ailment, a thorn in the flesh, and he prays not once, not twice, but three times that this thing could be removed from him and it isn't.
[time=806] And I find it rather hard to believe that God is wishing or willing that Paul were in fact healed, and the problem is Paul's faith or Paul's lack of confession of sin.
[time=817] He was a man of monstrous faith and was a man who confessed his sin openly and in fact said, I am the chief of sinners.
[time=825] The passage there in 2 Corinthians 12 in fact concludes this way when God responds to Paul's repeated request that he could be healed physically.
[time=834] God says to Paul, my grace is sufficient for you for power is perfected in weakness.
[time=838] In other words, you're not gonna get healed.
[time=840] And the reason you're not gonna get healed isn't because you lack faith and it isn't because you lack a proper confession of sin, it is because I want my power and I want my grace, God speaking, on display through your ailment and through your weakness.
[time=854] There is no biblical argument that can be made that God's priority plan is for all Christians to be healthy at all times.
[time=864] And that then this passage, verses 14 and 15, is the formula which if followed properly will produce such healings.
[time=872] You can't build the argument, it's not found.
[time=874] In fact, the opposite is true.
[time=877] The absolute opposite is true.
[time=879] In 2 Corinthians 4, Paul speaking of his own body, he describes it to an earthen vessel which would have been made of clay, which would not have been very substantial.
[time=888] And in the progress of the gospel, he is saying that his earthen vessel is getting absolutely worn out and wiped out.
[time=894] He says in verse seven, but we have this treasure, the treasure is the gospel.
[time=899] In earthen vessels, his body, that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of God, not from ourselves.
[time=906] We are afflicted in every way but not crushed, perplexed but not despairing, persecuted but not forsaken, struck down but not destroying.
[time=913] Now listen, always carrying about in the body the dying of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
[time=920] Not only can you not build an argument that God wants all Christians healthy all the time, you can build very strong arguments that God has built into the process of the propagation of the gospel times when the messenger himself will become terribly sick, crushed, struck down.
[time=939] In fact, he opens 2 Corinthians with this comment, indeed we had the sentence of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves but God who raises the dead.
[time=947] Sharing the gospel for Paul brought him into all kinds of sickness, all kinds of physical beatings and calamities, none of which were healed and all of which were used to proclaim the gospel in a powerful way, that in the earthen treasure, in this earthen human expendable vessel resides the treasure of the glory of the gospel of God.
[time=968] The same thing basically is said in Philippians three,
[time=975] when talking about his ministry and the passion of his ministry to know Christ, he says that I may know him, namely Christ, and the power of his resurrection.
[time=982] Now watch, and the fellowship of his sufferings being conformed to his death in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.
[time=991] Paul knew that the passionate pursuit of Christ in his life meant the fellowship of the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings that he would eventually be conformed to his death.
[time=1002] And of course the gospel eventually took his death.
[time=1005] The fact is this, God would have us so committed to Christ and so committed to the propagation of the gospel that we would be willing to throw our physical health away if it meant that the gospel could move forward, that we would in fact be Romans 12, remember where it says living sacrifices, to offer our bodies a living sacrifice acceptable to God, which is our true service of spiritual worship, that we would allow our physical health to be broken and destroyed that we would die through sickness if in fact moving into the various arenas where the gospel were not known entailed our becoming sick.
[time=1039] And there are books and books and books and books of missionaries who have done just that.
[time=1045] And whose health has been broken and who have died as did Paul in the progress of the gospel.
[time=1050] It's all a part of the way that God preaches truth and punctuates the power of those individual commitment to that truth.
[time=1058] That is why when I have been called to pray for people as it says in James 14 and 15, which I have done on numerous occasions, those times have always been good and rich and meaningful, good fellowship.
[time=1072] It was a healthy expression of our love for this ailing person, but I have always read these verses and put a disclaimer on verse 15 and said, you know, I don't really understand these verses or these particular words in this verse because I do not believe that it is a matter of cracking the code of what is a prayer offered in faith and what is sufficient confession of sin on your part and that if you don't get healed, it'll be either our fault or your fault, that God is standing there wishing for you to be healed, wanting for you to be healed, and the big issue here is whether or not we can pray right and you can confess right.
[time=1107] I would always make a disclaimer and try to strip away from them any sense of false hope that that was in fact what these verses meant because it would be a cruel injustice to leave them with the impression that they're now gonna die from their cancer because we didn't pray right or they didn't confess right in light of the rest of God's counsel on the issue.
[time=1128] Never understood this passage nor come across an interpretation that made any sense to me of this passage until this week, interestingly enough.
[time=1136] And what I wanna present to you this morning is a completely different approach to this passage.
[time=1143] It's one that you will not find in the bookstore.
[time=1146] It is one that you will not find on the shelves of my library.
[time=1149] I know of only one other Bible teacher theologian who holds this view and I didn't know he held it until I came across it this week and I think it's right.
[time=1159] But it is breaking tradition.
[time=1162] It is breaking the longstanding tradition of how this text has been translated from the Greek into the English and how this text has been interpreted and taught for centuries, which is obviously a cause for great concern, anything new in theology is usually wrong, which is why I expose the interpretation to several elders and a couple of our staff this week just to try to get their perspective on it.
[time=1186] Most of us felt pretty comfortable with it.
[time=1190] So let's take a look at how these verses might better be understood.
[time=1193] These verses, verses 13 to 18 are all about prayer.
[time=1198] But I do not believe they are about praying for people who are physically ill, cancer, heart attacks, paralysis, whatever it may be.
[time=1208] I do not believe that this is an injunction to pray for people who are physically sick so they can be receiving a physical healing.
[time=1214] Instead, I believe these verses are about praying for a spiritual healing of those who are spiritually sick.
[time=1220] They are sick, all right.
[time=1222] It is just not a physical sickness.
[time=1224] It is a spiritual sickness.
[time=1226] In other words, James is speaking to Christians in verse 14 who are weak rather than sick.
[time=1234] They are spiritually weak who have been under great persecution and hardship and trial and who are losing the spiritual battle of endurance.
[time=1243] They have been beaten down by the process.
[time=1246] They are on the verge of giving up, losing heart is what Paul calls it in 1 Corinthians, rather 2 Corinthians 5.
[time=1253] They are tapped out, spiritually exhausted, to the extent that they can't even pray for themselves.
[time=1258] And when they have hit this point of rock bottom spiritually, the text calls for them to call for the elders who will come and pray for them, men who are strong spiritually and who can pray for this spiritually-informed condition.
[time=1275] That upon praying, they might receive spiritual strength in the inner man to be spiritually quickened, to be renewed.
[time=1283] Okay, that's what I believe this text is saying in general.
[time=1286] Now let's back up and take a look at it, verse 13.
[time=1289] He introduces three categories of people.
[time=1290] The first in verse 13 is any among you suffering.
[time=1294] That's category one.
[time=1296] The suffering here talks about receiving ill treatment from people.
[time=1300] And he is saying if you are receiving ill treatment from people, as we know they were, as we looked at verse five, the wicked rich, dragging them in a court, falsely accusing them and murdering them through the court system, pray.
[time=1312] Find the spiritual resource to withstand the hostilities of this day and age through prayer and call upon the power of God that you might be strengthened to stand.
[time=1322] The second category of people he raises is also in verse 13.
[time=1326] He says, "Is any among you cheerful?" Let him sing praises.
[time=1330] The word cheerful means well of soul.
[time=1333] It means a state or condition of happiness because some things are going well for you.
[time=1339] And you say, what might that have been?
[time=1341] Well, maybe your spouse was dragged into court by the wicked rich of chapter five and instead of being condemned and put to death, somehow your spouse got off the hook.
[time=1351] And so even in a very oppressed situation, there are joys to be found.
[time=1355] And if you are in the joyful category, if you are cheerful, sing praises.
[time=1361] Category three, verse 14.
[time=1362] Is any among you sick, better, spiritually weakened?
[time=1367] Spiritually broken down, spiritually impoverished.
[time=1373] Now let's back up a little bit further and get the context of this book because that's always germane in properly understanding and interpretation of any given text.
[time=1382] This book is written by James to Jews, Jews who were raised in the Judaism system of the Old Testament, who heard about Christ, confessed Christ, came out of Judaism and formed a church in Jerusalem.
[time=1396] And in Acts seven and eight, they came under such incredible hostility, the stoning of Stephen.
[time=1400] There was just outrage among the Jews against those who had come to Christ, outward persecution that they were scattered abroad.
[time=1408] We believe they landed somewhere in Asia Minor.
[time=1411] And this whole book is about how to respond to the trials and the temptations of suffering in a hostile environment.
[time=1418] And proving that you are truly born again under such hostility because no matter how hot it gets, you continue to respond properly and give evidence that you are truly born again.
[time=1430] You stay faithful by enduring and patience and give evidence to the fact that you are truly born again.
[time=1436] These were Jews who had incredible hostility and stress and persecution and ostracism from the outside and who also were facing all kinds of temptations and lusts and infighting within the church and quarreling inside.
[time=1448] And the call of James is to stop the sinning and stay in endurance and to stay with patience.
[time=1455] And in that, prove that you are truly born again.
[time=1457] So as you remember in chapter one, trials come.
[time=1461] What are they, friend or foe?
[time=1463] Friend, respond properly to the trial.
[time=1465] The trial makes you strong.
[time=1466] The trial produces endurance, makes you perfect.
[time=1469] Complete lacking in nothing is what the text said.
[time=1472] You face temptations, don't blame your circumstances.
[time=1475] Don't blame anybody but you, when you are carried away by your temptations, you're carried away by your own lust.
[time=1480] You are culpable, you are responsible.
[time=1481] Therefore you are able to resist it.
[time=1483] Stop sinning, put away sin, live obediently.
[time=1486] Don't be a friend of the world.
[time=1489] The theme, I could go chapter by chapter but let's jump to chapter five and you'll see in verse seven, be patient.
[time=1495] The same thought again, therefore brethren and we know that that patience is not enduring under hard circumstances, it is enduring under hard people.
[time=1503] The wicked rich in this case.
[time=1504] We're making life difficult and if you remember the text, he gave you four ways to stay in endurance even when harmful, sinful people are after you.
[time=1513] They were living in a day and living in an environment full of persecution and trials and ostracism and suffering and hardship.
[time=1522] And here's the point, if they responded right in a godly way to the hardship, they would what?
[time=1529] They would grow, they would get stronger.
[time=1534] James one, they would be perfect and complete lacking in nothing, which doesn't mean they don't sin.
[time=1538] It means that they're mature godly sound Christians.
[time=1542] On the other hand, if they responded wrongly to the trials and the hardship and the suffering and the temptations that came with it, they would become what, spiritually weak.
[time=1554] When you are confronted with trials in your life and hardships in your life, if you do not respond as God's word indicates, it will take you down spiritually and you'll get on a winding road down into spiritual weakness and a lack of character.
[time=1569] And over time, you can hit the bottom of that road and be in a spiritually impoverished state where you have no longer the access or the experiential ability to put into practice your spiritual resources and your shot and you've hit bottom, you're broken down, you're worn out and you're spiritually weak.
[time=1587] That is who you have in view in verse 14.
[time=1593] Is anyone among you spiritually weak?
[time=1596] Now, what does that word mean, weak or rather sick?
[time=1602] Do you see it there in verse 14?
[time=1603] That first question, is any among you sick?
[time=1606] Let's use several times in the New Testament and it's used to translate physical illness.
[time=1614] But the word is esthenetto in the Greek but its primary meaning isn't physically sick.
[time=1623] If you'll track it in the New Testament, its primary meaning is not physically sick, it is spiritually weak, it is feeble, it is impotent.
[time=1632] Now hold your finger here if you will, I've got to show you this 'cause I don't think you'll go with me in this argument if you don't see it with your own eyes.
[time=1639] So hold your finger in James and come to Romans four and I'll show you four different times, rather three different times where the same Greek word esthenetto is translated weak and the context is obvious, it's spiritual weakness, not physical weakness, okay?
[time=1656] Romans four, 19, here's your first look at it.
[time=1659] Speaking of Abraham, he without becoming what?
[time=1663] Weak in faith contemplated his own body now as good as dead for he's about 100 years old and the deadness of Sarah's womb yet respect to the promises of God, he did not waver in unbelief but grew strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully assured that what he had been promised he was able also to perform, that's the word esthenetto at the beginning of verse 19.
[time=1686] Doesn't mean he became, he didn't become physically weak, that is all about the inner strength of his personal walk with God, the power of his faith, he did not become exhausted though the trial was incredible, what was it?
[time=1700] Well he was too old to produce children, his wife was certainly too old to produce children and the whole covenant of God depended upon a child coming out of their loins.
[time=1708] It was impossible, did he get weak?
[time=1712] No, he was spiritually strong, okay, has nothing to do with physical sickness.
[time=1718] Come to chapter five, look at verse six.
[time=1721] Same Greek word esthenetto, for while we were, my translation says helpless, I don't know what yours says, helpless or weak, for while we were still helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
[time=1734] That's not talking about our physical ability to run a mile or get up and be healthy and do the normal things in life.
[time=1740] That is talking about the inability, the depravity of man, the helpless condition, the spiritually depraved condition where you cannot help yourself in salvation and the only help you have is Christ, right?
[time=1752] Have nothing to do with physical strength.
[time=1754] Come to Romans 14-1, you'll find another use of that same Greek word esthenetto, to mean spiritual weakness.
[time=1764] Here we're looking at the weaker brother, not in terms of physical strength, but in terms of conscience.
[time=1769] And some could eat the meat offered to idols, and others couldn't.
[time=1773] Verse 14, now, excuse me, verse one of chapter 14, now accept the one who is esthenetto in faith, who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions.
[time=1785] One man has faith that he may eat all things that would include meat offered to the Gentile gods, but he who is weak eats vegetables only.
[time=1794] That has nothing to do with physical strength.
[time=1796] That has everything to do with the strength of his faith, his walk with God, his inner man.
[time=1801] Okay, back to James 5.
[time=1803] Now, we could go on, I mean, there are other books.
[time=1806] There's first Corinthians and second Corinthians, and it's all over the New Testament.
[time=1810] The primary meaning of the word you're looking at, as it's translated in the New Testament, at the beginning of chapter, verse 14 is this, is anyone among you spiritually weak, spiritually feeble, spiritually impotent?
[time=1824] Not physically sick.
[time=1825] You're in the battle, you're broken down,
[time=1831] your spiritual strength is going away, you're under the daily stress, one thing leads to another, you may even complicate the situation by your own personal sin, and before you know it, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, you are at the bottom, and you do not even find the strength to pray for yourself.
[time=1847] What should you do?
[time=1848] Pray, call for the spiritually mighty.
[time=1853] Pray for verse 14, let him call the elders of the church.
[time=1857] Who are the elders?
[time=1858] They are the ones who are strong in faith, and mighty in faith, and mature, and godly, and victorious, and draw upon their strength, because the effective fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.
[time=1869] You know where that's found?
[time=1871] Look at the end of verse 16.
[time=1872] Isn't that interesting?
[time=1876] The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
[time=1879] In your weakness, that implies that some prayers are strong, and some prayers are weak.
[time=1884] It also implies that the dependent strength of anyone's prayer is their own righteousness, their own godliness, their own maturity, their own walk with God.
[time=1894] It's saying at the end of verse 16, the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
[time=1899] When you are spiritually weak, and impoverished, and destitute, and you can't find even the strength to begin to pray for yourself, then at least call for the elders, and let them come, and offer the effective fervent prayers.
[time=1911] I was sharing this with a medical doctor this week, just because I wanted his opinion on the deal, and he had been involved several years ago in the restoration of a pastor who had fallen into adultery.
[time=1925] And this doctor friend of mine, and a couple of elders from the church representing the whole elder board, met with this individual, just when the news broke.
[time=1935] I mean, just when he finally confessed.
[time=1939] And as I explained this interpretation of this text to this particular doctor, he began to have tears in his eyes because he says that is exactly what happened.
[time=1948] That is it.
[time=1951] The pastor was in such a weakened, impoverished state after trying to hide his adultery for three, four, five months betraying not only his wife, but the church, and all that he stood for.
[time=1961] And that course, a process that had developed over several years where he had finally come to the bottom, and it was as if he could only barely say from his heart, I want to repent.
[time=1971] I mean, he could barely muster those words because the allure of this other woman and the other life was so attractive that he barely had spiritual strength to recognize the beauty of obedience, the call of repentance.
[time=1984] And it was everything he could do to say, I want to repent.
[time=1989] And then those elders took over, and they began to lay hands on him and pray for him at long sessions and long periods of strength and infusing his soul with the strength of God as their prayers, their godly prayers were being answered on his behalf.
[time=2006] It's a wonderful story.
[time=2009] The man is fully recovered.
[time=2010] He's not in ministry, but he is back with his wife and stronger spiritually than he's ever been.
[time=2015] And as my doctor friend looked at that, who was himself an elder as well, he said, I can't believe it, that's exactly what happened.
[time=2022] It was as if, this were his words, it was as if my pastor friend was caught in the current of a very strong river and was able to recognize that he was in big trouble, it was stronger than he was, he had already been weakened by the struggle and there was nothing he could do to extricate himself from the situation.
[time=2040] All he could do was throw up a hand and say, help.
[time=2043] And the elders grabbed him through the power of their prayer and brought him to safety.
[time=2048] You say, well, no, wait a minute, where do we see that in the Bible?
[time=2055] Remember Acts six?
[time=2057] The apostles said, we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
[time=2062] In other words, one of the major ministries of an apostle then that mantle handed to the elders was the ministry of prayer and they would not allow anything to get in the way of the ministry of their prayer life, even a dispute between widows in the New Testament church.
[time=2077] They appointed deacons to handle that and said, no, no, no, we will stay with the ministry of prayer and the ministry of the word.
[time=2083] Question, what were they praying for?
[time=2085] How were they praying?
[time=2087] What was the content of their prayer?
[time=2088] Can you show me prayers, Russell, where the apostles, the elders were praying for this spiritual renewal you're speaking of?
[time=2095] They're everywhere in the New Testament.
[time=2098] I'll give you one example for the sake of time.
[time=2100] Listen to this, it's in Ephesians chapter three, it's a prayer of Paul.
[time=2104] He says, for this reason, I bow my knees before the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth thrives its name, now here's the prayer, that he would grant you, Paul praying for the saints at Ephesus, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power through his spirit in the inner man.
[time=2125] So that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[time=2141] That prayer is to take people to a whole new level of strength in the inner man so that they can comprehend the things of God, their eyes can see what before they didn't see, gain insights and wisdom into what?
[time=2155] Theology know the love of Christ, what is the breadth, the length, the height, the depth, the unconditional, compassionate love of Christ in your life so that you can then be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[time=2167] Does that sound like the opposite of being spiritually impoverished?
[time=2171] Of course.
[time=2173] We could go to prayer after prayer, after prayer, after prayer in the life of Paul and other leaders in the New Testament church and you will find them not praying for the physical health of people.
[time=2182] They covered that with their gift of healing and it was as easy as handing a napkin to the messenger who took it to the sick person and they were healed.
[time=2190] Sometimes they didn't even do that.
[time=2192] When you find them praying, when you find them beseeching God, when you find them in the throne room of God praying for other saints, it is consistently for the spiritual well-being, the inner strength, the inner spiritual health of people.
[time=2204] So it fits.
[time=2207] I mean, it is consistent with what we see revealed about their prayer life.
[time=2211] Now what about this anointing with oil?
[time=2213] What is that?
[time=2214] You see it there in verse 14, let them pray over him, anointing him with oil.
[time=2218] You see, in the ancient world and still today, some oils have medicinal purposes and in the very crude, unscientific practice of medicine in that day, sometimes oil was all you got.
[time=2229] It was as good as we could do.
[time=2231] And so interpreters through the years would look at that and say, oh see, that's got to be the anointing of a sick person with medicinal oil.
[time=2239] But if you'll just look in a basic Bible dictionary, something as basic as Unger's Bible Dictionary, you'll find about six or seven purposes for oil in the ancient world and medicinal was only one of them.
[time=2249] It would be used in funerals to anoint the corpse.
[time=2252] It would be used in ritual ceremonial expressions inside the temple.
[time=2256] It would be used and this I think here for cosmetic, almost just basic hospitality.
[time=2262] They're practiced, they lived in a very dry part of the world, see?
[time=2266] And you know what happens when you get out in the sun?
[time=2268] You get sunburned and you get dried out and your chips, your lips, I can say this, your lips get chapped.
[time=2275] And what are you looking for?
[time=2279] Oil.
[time=2279] You wonder where the cream is, man.
[time=2283] And you rub all of stuff, you rub that all over your body and you feel better, you feel refreshed.
[time=2288] There is no reason this has to be medicinal oil.
[time=2291] This could be the ministry of encouragement of elders who come and don't just stand in the presence of this spiritually weakened conditioned person, but do the basic stuff of that ancient day's hospitality.
[time=2303] In Luke 746, the Lord's talking about it and he says, wash the feet and anoint the head with oil.
[time=2308] They put the oil on their hair, which I don't much understand.
[time=2310] I mean like, you know, yee, that would get kind of slimy.
[time=2313] But they would do that and it was a gracious act of love.
[time=2317] It was a wonderful statement of encouragement and hospitality.
[time=2321] Have you ever been in a stress situation and received a hug from another person?
[time=2326] The physical contact seems to just draw or drain the junk inside of you.
[time=2333] Heidi and I, when we're at points of tension in our relationship, though we don't feel like hugging each other because the conflict isn't resolved yet, we will just hug each other and just stand there for a little while and let the things start to soften, right?
[time=2347] And then we try to work through the actual problem.
[time=2350] This may be nothing more than elders finding an appropriately, culturally relevant way to put their arms around massage.
[time=2358] The word anoint, there's two words in the Greek for this.
[time=2360] One means to like ceremonially dab anoint.
[time=2363] That's not this word.
[time=2364] This word is your basic common ordinary rub.
[time=2367] Rub 'em down, massage 'em.
[time=2369] Encourage 'em by your physical touch.
[time=2373] So you're weak, you're wiped out, you're on the edge.
[time=2377] The whole book is about not going over the edge.
[time=2380] The whole book is about staying faithful to the cause of Christ even in the midst of trial and you've got some people here in view who have gone to the very brink of disaster.
[time=2389] And they're so weak they can't even pray for themselves.
[time=2393] Call for the elders, call 'em quick and they'll come and they won't just pray, they'll touch ya.
[time=2402] They'll get in there with ya, they'll hug ya, they'll say it's gonna be okay.
[time=2405] We're for ya in this context and they'll begin to pray and pray and pray and pray and then you will what?
[time=2413] Now here's a promise I can live with, look at verse 15.
[time=2416] And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up, okay?
[time=2425] Can you live with that?
[time=2427] Do you believe that God would bind himself?
[time=2431] That if the prayer is offered in faith, and if, we'll get to this in a minute, if there has been sin, if that's been confessed, that God will infuse that person with spiritual strength, you know what, you can find God obligating himself in that way all over the New Testament.
[time=2446] He is totally committed to responding to people's spiritual requests when it involves their own spiritual strength.
[time=2453] You need no further than James 4, just turn back a page.
[time=2456] Listen to him bind himself here.
[time=2458] Remember this context, chapter four, why do you, you know, what are these conflicts about?
[time=2463] Verse one, how come you're fighting amongst each other?
[time=2467] Verse two, well, he gets into this whole thing, it turns out they're pleasure seekers and they're proud and all they want is their own way.
[time=2472] Now here comes verse six, but he gives a greater grace.
[time=2476] Therefore God is opposed to the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.
[time=2479] Well, how does he do that?
[time=2480] Look at verse seven, submit therefore to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.
[time=2485] Verse eight, draw near to God and he will what?
[time=2489] You can count on it, it's a promise from God.
[time=2493] You humble yourself, you submit underneath God's rule in your life, you resist the devil, you draw near to God and you can be absolutely assured that God will draw near to you and that can be nothing other than his moving into your life and giving you a sense of his presence, a strengthening of your heart.
[time=2509] Look at verse 10, humble yourselves in the presence of the Lord and he will exalt you.
[time=2517] That's a promise.
[time=2518] God binds himself spiritually to people all over the New Testament.
[time=2524] Those are dimensions of the New Covenant.
[time=2525] Those are the distinctives of the New Covenant.
[time=2528] We are not in a covenant of physical, circumstantial, environmental things, that was the Old Testament.
[time=2535] That's the Old Covenant.
[time=2537] If you worshiped God in the Old Testament, you can expect more money, more sheep, more kids, all that stuff.
[time=2543] You come to the New Covenant and you don't have that anymore.
[time=2546] He makes no such promises for physical realities.
[time=2549] All he promises you is spiritual health and strength, regardless of your circumstances.
[time=2556] So that's a promise you can live with.
[time=2559] Now you're saying to yourself, okay, verse 15, what's this word sick again?
[time=2563] And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, literally translated.
[time=2568] That word means to be weary, to be weary and that Greek word is only used one other place in the New Testament.
[time=2577] And it has nothing to do with physical health.
[time=2580] It's again, spiritual strength.
[time=2583] It's over in Hebrews 12.
[time=2585] Remember that passage where it says that we should fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joys set before him endured the cross to spising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=2596] Now, verse three, here's our word.
[time=2598] For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself.
[time=2602] Why should you do that?
[time=2604] Why should you think about the price that Jesus paid and the distance that he went?
[time=2609] So that you may not, there it is, grow weary and lose heart.
[time=2613] It's the only other place that that word sick in James 515 is used in the New Testament and has nothing to do with physical sickness.
[time=2621] It has everything and only to do with spiritual health and strength and stamina and endurance as we try to run the race.
[time=2627] Okay?
[time=2633] Let's look some more at verse 15.
[time=2634] James 515, the prayer offered in faith will restore.
[time=2640] That word means, that's sodzo in the Greek.
[time=2642] It means spiritual help, spiritual salvation.
[time=2645] It means to be put whole in a spiritual condition of wholeness.
[time=2649] He'll do that for you.
[time=2650] The prayer offered in faith will put you back in a position of spiritual wholeness.
[time=2655] It goes on in verse 15 and the Lord will raise him up.
[time=2660] That word means, well, technically it means to be raised like from the dead.
[time=2664] The Catholic church takes it and makes the doctrine of extreme unction whereby if prayers are offered in the proper way by the proper people they can raise people from the dead.
[time=2672] But it can also mean to rebuild or to arouse or to awaken or to excite.
[time=2679] And so it is very natural to understand it this way.
[time=2682] Verse 15, the prayer offered in faith will make spiritually sound the one who is weary and weak and the Lord will quicken.
[time=2689] The Lord will awaken, the Lord will excite him, bring him back to a place of spiritual receptivity with God.
[time=2696] Not that he's lost his salvation and he gains it.
[time=2699] He's always been saved, he's just gone to the very brink, the very bottom without spiritual strength.
[time=2705] Now, at the end of verse 15 and if he has committed sins they will be forgiven him.
[time=2711] That's a third-class conditional.
[time=2712] It means under the, given the possibility that sin might have been a part of this whole thing, right?
[time=2719] And that doesn't surprise us.
[time=2721] You and I know that when we get under very difficult circumstances, we are very prone to be tempted by sin.
[time=2726] And in fact, very vulnerable at those points.
[time=2729] And so the picture is a sickness, a spiritual weakness that is brought on by the circumstances themselves being improperly responded to, then complicated by the person's own choosing to sin which spends them into a tailspin.
[time=2743] And they are just now absolutely drained of any strength.
[time=2750] That's exactly how it happens.
[time=2751] If you're weak, call the elders.
[time=2755] Spiritually weak, call the elders.
[time=2758] Let them anoint you with oil.
[time=2761] Confess your sin.
[time=2763] Get that stuff out, get that stuff in the open.
[time=2765] And then let them pray about what's really going on in your life.
[time=2769] The trial as well as what, however it may have been complicated by the sin itself.
[time=2773] And you can count on God bringing spiritual renewal and strength and help.
[time=2779] Now does this mean that all the consequences of your sin are gone?
[time=2782] No, you still suffer through those.
[time=2786] If you were sexually active and you picked up AIDS and you call the elders and they come and pray, it can revive your heart and your soul.
[time=2792] There's no promise here that the AIDS disappears.
[time=2795] This is not some like quick fix thing.
[time=2800] This means that through their prayers and through your confession, if appropriate, you can get yourself back in the game and start in that process of spiritual growth.
[time=2809] You'll have enough strength to get going again.
[time=2812] Get moving.
[time=2813] Okay.
[time=2817] Now, because that's true, verse 16 makes a secondary application.
[time=2824] Look at verse 16, therefore, now he's gonna get broader because that's true therefore.
[time=2829] Now here, look at how it applies over here.
[time=2831] Confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed.
[time=2837] Because it is true that if trials are improperly responded to they can tear you down and weaken you and destroy your spiritual strength and leave you in an impoverished condition where only the elders can then pray effectively for you and you are needing to draw on their strength.
[time=2851] Don't even get going down that path.
[time=2856] Don't even get started towards spiritual weakness.
[time=2859] Well, how do I avoid that?
[time=2861] Well, verse 16, confess your sins to one another.
[time=2864] Have some people in your life who you can trust to talk to the truth about what's really going on in your life, including even the confession of your sins.
[time=2873] And since prayer we understand is something I can do for you, I can pray God's power into your life, then let me pray for you.
[time=2882] So keep very short accounts, high accountability, confess your sin, let other people know what's really going on so that their prayer life can be immediately directed to the real issues in your life is what that means.
[time=2896] It's a secondary application of the truth taught in verses 14 and 50.
[time=2899] You see God, man, he wants your sin out.
[time=2903] He wants it confessed.
[time=2904] He wants it exposed.
[time=2906] Satan wants you alone with your sin.
[time=2909] If Satan can keep you and your sin alone, he's got you because there you can wallow in the sin and the failure and the guilt and the shame, you can nurse it, you can nurture it and it keeps its hold on you.
[time=2923] But if you'll have the courage to talk honestly about the sins in your life with another person, then they can pray for you and it's out in the open and you can be receiving strength from God as we saw Paul praying in Ephesians three, strength in the inner man.
[time=2937] Okay, well what about this word healed?
[time=2941] You're thinking in verse 16, healed, see it there?
[time=2944] Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another so that you may be healed.
[time=2948] What's that word, Russell?
[time=2949] Is that a word that speaks of physical illness?
[time=2952] The recovery from physical illness?
[time=2955] Well, sometimes in the New Testament, it is used that way.
[time=2958] But it is very often used of spiritual healing.
[time=2962] The Lord uses it in Matthew 13, 15 where he's talking to the nation of Israel and he says, you guys have dull hearts and you have eyes that can't see and you will not come to me and be converted lest I heal you.
[time=2977] He's not talking about physical problems.
[time=2981] He's talking about salvation there.
[time=2983] You will not come to me and confess your sins so that I could heal you.
[time=2986] The reason they wouldn't acknowledge him as the true Lord and Savior is because they had hard hearts and blinded eyes and they didn't get saved and God rejected the whole nation.
[time=2993] Wasn't their physical condition at all?
[time=2995] The same truth is taught in John 1240.
[time=2997] Speaking of this different group of people, same problem, blind eyes, hard hearts.
[time=3000] You won't come and be converted, lest I heal you.
[time=3003] Now the clincher on this one, just turn back into Peter.
[time=3008] It's the very next book to your right.
[time=3010] Look at 1 Peter 2.24.
[time=3012] Remember, this is a wonderful passage.
[time=3019] And this is one of the ones we memorize in a Wanna.
[time=3021] 1 Peter 2.24 and he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross that we might die to sin and live to righteousness for by his wounds you were what?
[time=3034] Healed, same Greek word.
[time=3038] That has nothing to do with getting better from cancer, getting better from a heart condition, recovering from pneumonia, recovering from AIDS, recovering from anything physical.
[time=3048] That is this, you see, I am not counting on God and my faith in Christ to keep me from getting sick.
[time=3056] It's a given, you and I, short alerts coming, we're gonna get sick and we're gonna die.
[time=3062] But what we are counting on him to have done in his death on the cross as he bore the sins of the world and our own is that he would have healed us spiritually, that he would have given us salvation, that we are restored and healed and right with God.
[time=3074] Okay, back to James 5.
[time=3079] Verse 16, look at it again.
[time=3082] Therefore, confess your sins to one another, pray for one another so that you may be healed,
[time=3091] spiritually healed, spiritually strengthened.
[time=3097] It says in Psalm 66, "If I regard iniquity in my heart,
[time=3103] "the Lord will not hear me." The Lord doesn't hear our prayers when we have sin in our hearts.
[time=3108] So lest you start the slide down into spiritual weakness, beginning with other Christians, be talking about the struggles and the sins in your life and be praying yourself and allow them to pray for you so that you may be healed even from the sin of Christ.
[time=3126] From the beginnings of spiritual weakness.
[time=3128] Now we close here, he closes here,
[time=3135] with a tremendous truth and an illustration of the truth that really makes sense only if we interpret it as spiritual weakness.
[time=3144] If we stay with a physical sickness thing, it doesn't make any sense.
[time=3147] Look at the universe 16, here's the principle, we already looked at it, the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much.
[time=3156] Some people's prayers are more powerful than others.
[time=3159] Some people are in weakened conditions and their prayers are very ineffective and others are in a spiritually strong condition and they are very effective.
[time=3167] Why, just take Elijah for example.
[time=3169] Now that's what he does in verse 17.
[time=3171] Elijah, this is, remember Jews out of the Old Testament, he was a big time hero.
[time=3175] Everybody knew about Elijah, 1 Kings 17 and 18.
[time=3179] Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, which is to say, you can read about it, he is in 1 Kings hungry at points, he is fearful at points, he is tired by the battle at points, he's just human, he's just like us.
[time=3190] But here's the illustration.
[time=3194] He prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it didn't rain on the earth for three years and six months.
[time=3203] Now guess what's that, you add to the dry conditions of Israel, a three and a half year drought and you just went from dry to completely baked.
[time=3212] You went to a barren, destitute, dry, the soil would have been cracking, animals would have been dying, the place would have looked like a graveyard, which might be a little bit like the soul of a believer
[time=3228] who has failed to respond properly to the trials through time and who has allowed the condition of their soul to be barren and parched and dry and unfruitful.
[time=3242] But then verse 18, and he prayed again.
[time=3245] And the sky poured rain and the earth produced its fruit.
[time=3250] Pray for the power of God, allow righteous men to pray for the power of God in your life, confess your sin and call them to pray for you or just keep a short account and let your brothers pray for you on a regular basis and allow the blessings of God, the poor from the sky as it were to soften the soul so that you again can produce fruit, spiritual fruit.
[time=3271] Let me give you a couple closing comments.
[time=3276] Number one, I'm not actually nearly as dogmatic on this as I sound.
[time=3281] It's just been really fun preaching.
[time=3284] I really think this is right, but there's a big asterisk in my mind because it is so different than the historical perspective and it's relatively new.
[time=3293] The one interpreter only kind of came up with this thing in 1987, I think was the year.
[time=3297] And like I said before, anytime you got something new in theology, you probably have something wrong.
[time=3301] So what I'm gonna do in my mind is favor this interpretation, but I'm gonna hold it in caution until some people, a whole lot smarter than I am, theologians, seminary profs, these kinds of people have a chance to kind of get into the big debate on whether or not this is a possible or a viable interpretation.
[time=3319] And I would encourage you to do the same.
[time=3322] Secondly, James, you know what his nickname was?
[time=3327] Camel knees.
[time=3329] The guy had knees like grapefruit because he was like a carpet layer.
[time=3333] You ever seen it guys?
[time=3334] They're just big because he spent a lot of time on his knees in prayer.
[time=3336] And I wanna encourage you this morning to pray a lot more than you have been.
[time=3343] And when you pray, I wanna encourage you to pray.
[time=3346] Oh sure, maybe for somebody's health or for somebody's job or for somebody's something, but would you really go after the kinds of prayers that we see modeled in the New Testament where you're praying down the power of God into somebody else's life to give them spiritual strength in the inner man.
[time=3363] Line your prayer life up with that of the Lord and that of Paul and the others that we read who are almost without exception praying for the spiritual condition of people's hearts.
[time=3373] So get some baggy knees.
[time=3376] And as you do pray for people's souls, not just the unsafe, each other, Christians that they would be strengthened.
[time=3385] The third comment is, man, if you don't have any friends that you can be honest with about your sins, get them and get them soon.
[time=3392] Am I beating this drum loud enough and long enough folks?
[time=3395] I mean, is this in the word of God or isn't it?
[time=3397] There's just no way to escape it.
[time=3399] And the last one is, if you're here today where you have a friend who could have been here today but it's so spiritually weak, they're afraid to be here today.
[time=3410] And you would like us as elders to come pray.
[time=3416] Now we prayed for physical sicknesses in the past and I don't see why we shouldn't do it in the future.
[time=3420] But if you'd like us to come and pray for the spiritual condition of a person's soul who is confessing his sin and is knowledgeable that he is so weak or maybe there's no sin involved, they're just weak.
[time=3433] Call us, we'll be out to see you.
[time=3436] - Well, one thing seems absolutely sure.
[time=3440] God is committed to our being spiritually healthy.
[time=3444] That begins with a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3447] And if you've never prayed to receive Christ as your savior, I invite you to bow your head and follow along in this prayer and do that right now.
[time=3454] Father, I know that I'm a sinner.
[time=3457] I know that I have violated your absolute law of holiness and that I stand condemned and worthy of spiritual death.
[time=3463] I believe in Jesus Christ as my savior, the son of God who died for my sins.
[time=3468] I accept him as my Lord and savior into my heart and life today for the forgiveness of my sins and the gift of eternal life.
[time=3475] Thank you for who he is and for what he has done and for my salvation in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3481] If you pray to receive that prayer today, write us and let us know the nature of that decision.
