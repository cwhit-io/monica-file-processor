[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=10] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=12] We're glad you've joined us today.
[time=14] AstroMoor has a challenging message for us, and you'll want to stay tuned.
[time=18] But right now, let's begin with music.
[time=20] [MUSIC - 145 seconds]
[time=169] - Our service will continue in just a moment.
[time=172] You know, each year, thousands of people enjoy our living Christmas tree.
[time=176] And now you can enjoy the sounds of our 1994 performance titled, "And Jesus is His Name with the Living Christmas Tree Audio Cassette." We're making this cassette available for a suggested gift to the Bible hour of $8 or more.
[time=190] So write to us today to get your copy and enjoy this beautiful music that celebrates the birth of our Savior.
[time=196] So stay tuned, I'll give you our address right after Pastor Moore's message.
[time=202] ("Pomp and Circumstance") [MUSIC - 79 seconds]
[time=292] He then you will guide us with us. And he shall pray. He shall pray. He shall pray for evermore.
[time=317] Round and bring our peace. Round and pour our voice. Wonderful.
[time=335] Come to life and God. If and you will guide us with us.
[time=342] And he shall pray. He shall pray. He shall pray for evermore.
[time=379] And we bring our peace. Round and pour our voice. Wonderful.
[time=394] Come to life and God. If and you will guide us with us.
[time=414] And he shall pray. He shall pray. He shall pray. He shall pray. He shall pray. He shall pray. He shall pray.
[time=431] He shall pray for evermore. Amen you will guide us with us forevermore.
[time=457] Amen you will guide us with us forevermore.
[time=473] Well the Christmas season is definitely here and I trust you all had a great Thanksgiving.
[time=482] I know Heidi and I and the kids did and as is our tradition that following Friday we ran out and got the Christmas tree and got it set up and put the train up around our tree and what we're excited about all these wonderful holiday celebrations.
[time=495] Of course the thing we're most excited about is celebrating the birth of Christ through the living Christmas tree and preparations are going wonderfully for that.
[time=503] All the tickets are gone now and we anticipated tremendous time. There's the possibility that you didn't get any tickets and that you wanted to get some tickets and our apologies for that.
[time=513] We always run out almost before we start handing them out. They tend to disappear in the very day we open distribution for them.
[time=520] But there is one concert. It's our premier concert on December 8th. It's in the evening on a Thursday. That's a special time where we perform the living Christmas tree for the very first time and it's a special group of people.
[time=532] And we happen to have some available tickets. And while all the other performances of the living Christmas tree are absolutely free of charge, the premier concert comes with a $5 charge.
[time=543] And we still have some tickets available for that and if you and your family would like to join us on that wonderful evening we invite you to do that.
[time=550] Just call us here at Blackhawk Baptist Church 493 7400 and let us know your name, your address and we'll send you those and you can pay us for those and we'll share that special evening together.
[time=563] I trust all is going well in your life and looking forward to the holiday season as much as we are, we're shipping our blessed Savior who came and dwelt among us so that He might save us from our sins.
[time=575] God bless you this holiday season.
[time=580] [MUSIC]
[time=592] Every day you hear the people talking, they say they're taking a stand.
[time=600] They're looking for a cause they can believe in for the welfare of man.
[time=607] But all I see are soldiers in a circle marching no place fast.
[time=615] Isn't it time the children of God take a stand that will last? Oh it makes me want to ask couldn't we stand to kneel a little longer?
[time=631] The time has never spent in vain, in light of all we stand again.
[time=641] Finding the faith that only makes us stronger, touching what we cannot see, reaching to heaven from our knees.
[time=656] Oh couldn't we stand?
[time=666] I know men so blinded by ambition, the joy is slipping away.
[time=673] But they're no worse than people who are living like there's only a day.
[time=681] And I can't help but shake my head and wonder what's it coming to?
[time=689] Lord give me strength to lift them in prayer cause it's all that I can do just to give them back to you.
[time=699] Couldn't we stand to kneel a little longer?
[time=704] The time has never spent in vain, in light of all we stand again.
[time=714] Finding the faith that only makes us stronger, touching what we cannot see, reaching to heaven from our knees.
[time=729] Oh couldn't we stand?
[time=747] Finding the faith that only makes us stronger, touching what we cannot see, reaching to heaven from our knees.
[time=758] Couldn't we stand to kneel a little longer?
[time=768] The time has never spent in vain, in light of all we stand again.
[time=777] Oh couldn't we put in the faith that only makes us stronger, touching what we cannot see, reaching to heaven from our knees.
[time=793] Oh couldn't we stand?
[time=811] We stand.
[time=826] Denise, she sings a song this morning about prayer and the power of prayer and the need for prayer.
[time=833] It's interesting that as we come to our last message today in the book of James as we kind of finish our study
[time=839] that clearly is the theme that James has on his mind.
[time=844] I want to thank you by the way for the privilege of teaching you the book of James.
[time=849] I'd like to think that if I didn't have this weekly responsibility that I would be as motivated to study God's Word,
[time=857] but I know that's not true.
[time=859] I know that apart from you and the need to stand here and try to clearly communicate God's truth to the best of my ability,
[time=866] it forces me into a discipline of study, an amount of study, a depth of study that I would never otherwise enjoy,
[time=872] and so I thank you for that accountability and I thank you for the privilege of being able to teach you the book of James.
[time=879] As James closes this book, and if you were here last week you'll know this, he is beginning to identify categories of people who are inside the church.
[time=890] Three categories we saw last Sunday, verse 13 are those who were suffering, those who were in trouble, those who had circumstantial difficulty,
[time=898] and there was an abundance of that for these particular believers in this particular day, and he calls on them to pray.
[time=907] And then he comes to a second category of people.
[time=910] Is any among you cheerful there in verse 13? And that word means circumstantial blessing or something to be happy about, cheerful of soul.
[time=920] Really, and we know that even within the context of suffering some things can go right, and though they wouldn't be much for us to take joy in,
[time=929] because we're not suffering like these folks were, those small breakthroughs can be a point of cheer and happiness,
[time=935] to those people he says let them sing praises, which is praying kind of through song with a melody, just put a melody to these words of joy and communicate them to God.
[time=945] A third category are those who are sick, verse 14, as any among you sick, and traditionally this passage has been understood to be physically ill,
[time=953] but as we studied it last week I think we're feeling a little more comfortable with the notion that it is spiritual sickness or spiritual weakness.
[time=962] And for those people who had gone through this enormous suffering and trial and struggle and had their spiritual resources depleted,
[time=970] they felt as if they were at the end of their rope, and it may have been complicated by their own sin, and their condition is weak spiritually.
[time=978] They are to pray, or to have prayer, but their prayers may not be effective, so they are to call for the elders of the church.
[time=985] Those who are spiritually strong and mighty so that they might pray over them, in verse 16 the effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much,
[time=994] as if to say in your spiritually weakened condition when you can't even pray for yourself effectively call for those who can the elders that you might be restored to a place of spiritual strength.
[time=1007] This morning we come to the last two verses in the book of James and a fourth category of people. This category are the unsaved.
[time=1016] Not those who are suffering, not those who are cheerful, not those who are spiritually weak, but the unsaved, the unregenerate,
[time=1022] who are in fact identified with the church, who may have made a profession of faith, who may regularly attend a particular gathering of believers called a church.
[time=1032] This fourth category is not the self-proclaimed pagan, not the atheist, not the one who is openly identified with some false religious system.
[time=1043] The unsaved in view here are those who are coming to a church, who are assembling with the truly redeemed, who may think themselves and may have a profession of redemption,
[time=1054] but who in fact are not truly born again. Every generation of people has had this category. Every church has had these people, the unsaved, the tears among the wheat.
[time=1068] There has never been a generation, there has never been a day, there has never been a city, there has never been a church who has not had this group of people.
[time=1076] We might expect even an influx of them in the churches of America in the days ahead. If you saw Newsweek this week, and this is not new information, they've been chronicling this for a number of years now.
[time=1089] Some suggesting as we approach the millennium, this spiritual awakening will even heighten.
[time=1096] Newsweek had a cover at Red This Way this week, The Search for the Sacred, America's Quest for Spiritual Meaning.
[time=1103] In the article, they indicated that 58% of America is sensing the need for spiritual growth.
[time=1110] It's now in Vogue again in America, unlike the last several decades, to use the S-words, Soul, Sacred, Spiritual and Sin.
[time=1122] One part of the article says this, "The seekers fit no particular profile, they include Wall Street investment bankers who spend their lunch hour in Bible study groups.
[time=1131] Artists, rediscovering religious themes, fitness addicts who've traded aerobics classes for meditation and other spiritual exercises.
[time=1140] No matter what path they take, the seekers are united by a sincere desire to find answers to profound questions to understand their place in the cosmos."
[time=1152] The article goes on to talk about how our culture of the last 30 years has stripped them of religion and family
[time=1160] and how they are "experiencing a gaping hole inside of them, and they are now on a quest to find something with which to fill the hole."
[time=1170] The article concludes this way, that in essence is the seekers' quest to fill the hole with a new source of meaning.
[time=1178] Why are we here? What is the purpose of our existence?
[time=1182] The answers change in each generation, but the questions are eternal.
[time=1189] Well that is in fact true, that is what it means to be made in the image of God.
[time=1194] It is that we have a capacity within us to be in relationship with God.
[time=1199] And there are going to be thousands, millions of Americans increasing and heightening and intensifying their quest to try to resolve that gaping hole inside of them.
[time=1212] Many of them are going to do that in false religious systems in America. They are going to grab ahold of cults, American-born cults and imported cults,
[time=1220] and they are going to find something of spirituality. They are going to find something that meets that need that this article is talking about,
[time=1229] and they will erroneously think that they have that need met, that they are now right with God, or at least on the right path to being right with God.
[time=1237] They will be hopelessly lost. Others of them will find their way into evangelical churches, and that is not a bad thing.
[time=1246] And in fact it even works hand in hand with what we are asking our church to be involved in, living proof and evangelizing,
[time=1252] and it is a day for that, it is an era for that, our culture is ripe for that, and we would hope that we could be effectively trained.
[time=1261] To respond to that quest inside so many unsaved people's hearts in our day, in our country, and lead them to a true and saving knowledge of Christ.
[time=1271] However, there will also be a number who will become associated with evangelical churches, who have that spiritual thing kind of satiated inside of them without truly being born again,
[time=1285] without truly being saved, and because they get in a ritual of coming to church, and maybe even hitchhiking on our true faith,
[time=1293] and the real spiritual dynamics that do happen in this church, they may have a sense that all is well with God,
[time=1301] and they will be in our church, and they will be in other evangelical churches, just like they were in the churches of the early church,
[time=1309] just like they were gathered around and assembled with and associated with and identified with this particular church to which James writes.
[time=1320] And so he wants to clarify, and he wants to address that there are those who are experiencing something of their spiritual appetites being satisfied,
[time=1331] but who are not in fact right with God.
[time=1336] And so they are the unsaved.
[time=1339] Now this text deals with this group of people.
[time=1343] And I just want this morning to ask and answer four questions that kind of come out of verses 19 and 20,
[time=1350] and I hope that they will be helpful for us as we understand what God would have us do in light of this particular category of people,
[time=1358] people who may already be in our church.
[time=1362] The first question is this, how do we identify these people, these people who are professors and not possessors?
[time=1371] And I must admit, and rightfully so, there is always a measure of confusion in answering this particular question.
[time=1379] It is not my position, and it is not your position to make definitive judgment statements about another person's salvation.
[time=1385] That is a matter that only God can know, because only God can see their heart.
[time=1389] And so I don't think or expect that this text or any other text will give us conclusive data whereby we could authoritatively declare
[time=1397] a particular person to be in this category, a professor only.
[time=1402] In fact, the very confusion of this issue is Brad into the way that James chooses to write verse 19.
[time=1409] He says there, "My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one turns him back,
[time=1415] the word brethren would lead many commentators and many people astray to think that these verses are about Christians and only Christians because they are called brethren."
[time=1426] But that is just not the case.
[time=1428] We don't have time this morning, but we could easily take you to a number of different passages in the New Testament where the word brethren is used in a very loose way to describe those who are merely associated with the church,
[time=1441] not necessarily born again in the church.
[time=1444] It's a term of warmth.
[time=1446] It's a term of affection.
[time=1448] Oftentimes Paul will use it when he's going to challenge people to a higher level in their Christian growth,
[time=1454] but it is loose by its very use in the New Testament.
[time=1457] And so he doesn't mean anything more than you and I would mean when we talk about the Christians over there at Blackhawk.
[time=1463] You know, it's basically a Christian church.
[time=1466] It's full of Christians, the Christians that go to Blackhawk.
[time=1469] We don't mean by that that the 2,000 or 2,500 people that have been associated with our church,
[time=1475] that every single one of them is born again.
[time=1478] It's just a reference to all of us who attend here.
[time=1481] That's what brethren is.
[time=1483] And it leaves room for the kinds of confusion and muddy realities that go on
[time=1489] when you get into this particular type of discussion.
[time=1492] But he does then identify them with three marks.
[time=1496] How do I identify them? He gives us three very strong points of identification.
[time=1500] The first in verse 19, my brethren.
[time=1503] If any among you, here it is, strays from the truth.
[time=1508] That's your first mark.
[time=1510] The word in the Greek plonetto is the word we get our word planet from.
[time=1515] A wandering body.
[time=1517] To stray or to wander, to go astray, to reject, in some cases to apostasize.
[time=1525] People who are wandering from the truth.
[time=1528] The truth, the word of God.
[time=1530] The clearly revealed principles and authoritative dogma that comes from God's word.
[time=1536] Even the gospel itself.
[time=1538] They begin to wander from that.
[time=1540] John 831 says, "If you abide or continue in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine."
[time=1548] We know that the mark of a believer isn't one who has a profession of faith, who can remember a time they think they prayed to receive Christ.
[time=1555] The true evidence of salvation is that you not only have that beginning point, whether you can remember the exact day or not is not the issue, but you have a beginning point with Christ and that you are then continuing in that.
[time=1567] You are obeying the word of God.
[time=1570] Christians don't habitually long-term stray from the truth.
[time=1577] The second mark is found in verse 20, it says, "Let him know that he who turns a sinner from,"
[time=1583] and this is the phrase, "the error of his way." The error of his way.
[time=1589] In other words, he has rejected the truth.
[time=1592] He has rejected the principles of God's word.
[time=1595] He has rejected what it would mean to look and live and act and think like Christ, and he has come up with his own way to do those things.
[time=1604] It happens to be error, but it is uniquely his own.
[time=1608] He has settled some of these issues independently of God's truth.
[time=1612] He has answered some of the great questions of life independently of God's truth, and then therefore has the error of his own way, kind of a lifestyle, a pattern of living.
[time=1622] The third mark, also in verse 20, is just the word sinner.
[time=1626] And this, to me, is the tale-tale indication that this text is not about errant Christians,
[time=1632] but is truly about unbelievers in the church.
[time=1636] Because nowhere in the New Testament is the word sinner used of anyone other than an
[time=1642] unbeliever.
[time=1644] That's pretty strong evidence.
[time=1648] Sinner is a word that characterizes a person.
[time=1651] It's a characterizing word.
[time=1653] You are a sinner.
[time=1655] In the Old Testament, Genesis 13, 3.
[time=1657] Now the men of Sodom were wicked exceedingly, and sinners against the Lord.
[time=1662] That was what they were. That was how they acted. That was their pattern.
[time=1666] That was their identity. That was their characteristic.
[time=1670] It says in Psalm 1, "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the council of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners?" People who do that as a way of life.
[time=1680] Romans 5, verse 8, this wonderful truth.
[time=1684] God demonstrated His love towards us in that while we were yet sinners.
[time=1692] When we were still unconverted, when we were still lost, and therefore when our life reflected such lostness in our behavior, that it was right and appropriate to call us
[time=1703] sinners.
[time=1705] You see, that is when God demonstrated His love towards us.
[time=1709] So these marks, straying from the truth, rejecting the way of God to create His own way,
[time=1719] His own way being sinful, characteristically sinful, therefore called a sinner.
[time=1725] That's how you identify these people.
[time=1728] Now just as a sub-question to all these other questions, does anybody come to mind?
[time=1736] I mean, as you're hearing this description, does a face kind of like form in your mind's
[time=1743] eye there?
[time=1744] Oh, yeah.
[time=1745] You know who this is?
[time=1747] This is so-and-so.
[time=1749] Made a profession of faith, maybe walked an aisle.
[time=1752] We thought she or he was saved.
[time=1755] But now you mention, okay, straight from the truth, his error of his or her own way, sinner.
[time=1761] Yeah.
[time=1763] Maybe that person's outside the church, isn't coming anymore.
[time=1765] Maybe that person is inside the church, still kind of playing the game.
[time=1768] Does anybody come to your mind who might fit into that category?
[time=1775] That's who he's addressing.
[time=1777] That's who he wants us to help.
[time=1779] That's who he's concerned about.
[time=1782] The second question, the second kind of major question here of the four that we want to ask of the text is this.
[time=1787] What kind of situation are these people in?
[time=1790] This one that maybe has formed in your mind.
[time=1792] And I believe that he brings this in because he wants to motivate us to help these people.
[time=1797] I believe that you and I are prone to underestimate the severity of this particular person's situation.
[time=1805] And I believe that because it is a little bit threatening to get involved in these kinds of deals, we are very prone to kind of assess their spiritual condition based upon that profession that occurred.
[time=1818] Back when or when they were walking with God, and we just kind of want to write the whole thing off to this little bit of obedient,
[time=1826] disobedient period, and everything will work out in the end.
[time=1829] And you see, James is going, wait, time out, time out now.
[time=1833] That is not the right way to look at this.
[time=1836] We're underestimating the problem.
[time=1838] Look at verse 20.
[time=1840] Let him know that he who turns the sinner from the air of his way, and here's the phrase I'd like you to look at,
[time=1846] will save his soul from death.
[time=1850] That's his situation.
[time=1852] His soul is on its way to death, not physical death, but eternal death.
[time=1857] Suka, soul, the whole person, the real person, the immortal person.
[time=1862] It's the you without your skin on.
[time=1865] If you just were to undress there of your skin and your bones and your muscles, whatever that is that's left, that's you.
[time=1872] That's your soul.
[time=1873] That's what this is talking about.
[time=1875] The real you, bound for eternal death.
[time=1880] Ezekiel 18-4, there's no reason to think that James wouldn't have known this particular passage as a student of the Old Testament.
[time=1888] "Behold, all souls are mine," says God.
[time=1892] "The soul of the Father as well as the soul of the Son is mine."
[time=1898] Then he says this, "The soul who sins will die." It's just a very, very strong statement.
[time=1906] The soul standing there in a stark, unprotected, exposed condition because they're out from underneath the protective grace of God through Christ.
[time=1915] And they're left there.
[time=1917] This little poor, impoverished, sinful, rebellious soul is left there to try to account for itself before God.
[time=1926] And God is clear and God is decisive. In fact, Psalm 510, here is one who loves God.
[time=1933] Here is one who understands the holiness of God, says this, "Hold them guilty, O God.
[time=1939] By their own devices let them fall in the multitude of their transgressions, thrust them out for they are rebellious against thee."
[time=1950] I think, again, we're prone to want to sympathize with the people.
[time=1954] And the psalmist here is sympathizing with a God who is holy and who has been rebelled against and who has been transgressed.
[time=1962] And you see, when you look at it from that perspective, you can say with the psalmist, "Yeah, hold them guilty, O God.
[time=1968] They have violated you. They have transgressed against you. They have done things to you which deserve.
[time=1974] They be thrust out because they are rebellious." And of course, those of us who are saved going, "So were we." I mean, you should have thrown us out, too.
[time=1986] James wants his readers, both the Christians and the unsaved inside this particular church, to understand that there's a harsh reality coming.
[time=1994] That's called hell.
[time=1997] And no amount of professions, and no amount of spiritual goosebumps, and no amount of assuaging the spiritual hunger inside of a person short of a personal relationship with Christ can prevent that outcome.
[time=2014] Now, we are a pretty outcome removed or consequence removed society.
[time=2020] There was a day, I mean, if you just think about this, the evolution of executions in our country.
[time=2025] You know, there was a day when people would be hung publicly.
[time=2031] Now, those have been depicted as rather sordid events by those who live in Hollywood and don't want us to think about the reality of consequences.
[time=2039] And the people, at least the movies that I've kind of seen, I wasn't old enough, obviously, to be at a public hearing hanging.
[time=2044] But when you see it depicted, you see people showing up with picnic baskets, and it's like they're going to go to a celebration of sorts.
[time=2051] They're going to go to a big thing, and they bring their kids on, and everybody's kind of drooling all over everybody else to find out how gruesome this hanging.
[time=2058] And they're depicted as this bloodthirsty group of people, right?
[time=2063] And you kind of tend to want to be repulsed by it and say, boy, that's ridiculous.
[time=2067] I don't think you should ever have a public execution, and I'm not even sure you should have executions.
[time=2074] Well, then we move from public executions to private executions, and then we move from private executions to delayed executions,
[time=2082] to where a person can commit a heinous crime today and go through this whole process, maybe probably never be put to death for his murderous act,
[time=2091] and if so, 15 to 20 years later in private, and we barely remember who the person was.
[time=2097] And then, of course, the last thing that our society has taken us to is no executions at all.
[time=2102] So let's just forget the notion of, like, big-time, life-altering, life-and-death consequences to behavior.
[time=2108] Let's get it out of here.
[time=2109] Now, I'm obviously not trying to advocate public executions.
[time=2113] I just think we need to be sensitive to the fact that we are desensitized to the consequences.
[time=2119] We live in almost a consequence-less society.
[time=2123] And people go bankrupt, and they declare certain things, and they get to hang on to lots of their assets instead of being absolutely destitute.
[time=2131] That's our way.
[time=2133] And James knows that that mentality can seep into the spiritual world.
[time=2141] And we can begin to lose a sense of the alarming reality that when people die without Christ,
[time=2149] whether they're inside the church or outside the church, it's a soul.
[time=2155] It's a real person, not the body and the flesh and all that stuff.
[time=2159] It's a real person who is now going to be separated from God for all eternity in hell.
[time=2166] Now, I think it was kind of hard for James to write this book.
[time=2169] This is not a warm book.
[time=2171] You know what I mean?
[time=2172] This is not like a warm, fuzzy-feeling book of all the wonderful things that God has done for us.
[time=2178] This is a book that puts a person's profession to the test.
[time=2184] And I know that a lot of believers don't like the book of James because it's too convicting, and I would encourage you with that if you don't like it because it's so convicting,
[time=2191] it may mean that you're really saved and you allow these things to convict you.
[time=2194] That's, by the way, a sign of salvation.
[time=2197] But James writes the book because he is burdened for these people who think they're saved and who aren't.
[time=2203] And I read it through again this week, just kind of for a last shot here for a while.
[time=2207] And I just noted 11 tests that James gives us.
[time=2213] 11 tests of true saving faith.
[time=2215] That, by the way, is the theme of the book, tests of a living faith.
[time=2218] And he gives us 11 of them.
[time=2219] I won't go into detail.
[time=2220] Let me just list them off for you.
[time=2222] He's doing this because he cares.
[time=2224] He's doing this because he doesn't want somebody to be deceived.
[time=2227] Chapter 1, how do you respond to trials?
[time=2229] What he was saying there is a true believer responds to trial by growing and being strengthened.
[time=2235] A true believer does not cry.
[time=2237] I'm a victim.
[time=2238] It's somebody else's fault.
[time=2240] And my life is a shambles and I can't control myself.
[time=2243] And I'm not held responsible for the devastation in my life because other people forced this on me.
[time=2250] A true believer as hard as it may be and as hard as the trials may have, and as victimized as they may have been,
[time=2258] doesn't then shift responsibility for the quality of their own character and integrity and the rightness with God to another person assumes responsibility and in the process grows and becomes godly.
[time=2267] That's what a true believer does.
[time=2270] A true believer, secondly, also in chapter 1, takes full responsibility for failing and falling to temptation.
[time=2278] Remember that?
[time=2279] You are carried away when you're tempted by your own lust and your own desire.
[time=2284] The true believer, when he sins or when she sins, again, doesn't try to shift responsibility to God who may have done the tempting
[time=2293] or some other person, that being a hypothetical thing, God does not tempt, but they blame him for tempting.
[time=2300] And so instead of a true, strong, heartfelt, gut-wrenching conviction over their own sin,
[time=2307] confessing it, standing up to it and saying, "I'm guilty, I deserve punishment, God."
[time=2313] A real believer does that.
[time=2316] A fake believer minimizes it, shuns it, tries to forget it, lies to himself about it, or ultimately blames God.
[time=2326] For putting him in such a difficult situation that there was no other option other than for him to sin.
[time=2331] If God would have really left me, he would have delivered me from that.
[time=2334] A believer says my fault.
[time=2336] Thirdly, in chapter 1 there, are you a doer of the word?
[time=2341] You see, here it is, it's not enough to have one, it's not enough to read one, it's not enough to know what's in one.
[time=2345] It's only enough to do one.
[time=2348] And if you or I constantly and consistently sit under the teaching of God's word, then we are convicted by the Spirit of God as to points that need to change, and we don't change them, and we have a pattern of not being a doer of the word, James is saying, hold the phone, reconsider.
[time=2366] Don't fool yourself.
[time=2368] Chapter 2, do you show partiality?
[time=2370] Do you treat people on the basis of how they might treat you and respond?
[time=2374] Are you evaluating whether you'll give, or take, or minister, or walk away, all that kind of stuff, based upon whether or not they've got something that you might benefit from?
[time=2383] Another test does your faith work, and that's kind of the big central, all encompassing piece here that grabs every dimension of our life.
[time=2390] If you say you have faith, but your faith does not works, your faith is dead.
[time=2396] Man, you can say you believe up a storm.
[time=2398] You can say you've got so many spiritual feelings inside about you, about God, and about Jesus, and you just know you just have these strong feelings.
[time=2407] I have a strong faith, and you look at your life, and your faith does not work.
[time=2411] God says you've got a dead faith.
[time=2416] Chapter 3, is your tongue out of control?
[time=2419] Is your tongue out of control?
[time=2421] Are you habitually offending the law of God and people around you with your tongue?
[time=2426] Question your salvation.
[time=2429] Are your relationships out of control?
[time=2432] Are your relationships full of strife, and anxiety, and selfishness, and impure motives
[time=2440] that you're continually colliding with one another?
[time=2443] Or are you marked by peace, and gentleness, and forgiveness, and humility?
[time=2449] It carries the theme into Chapter 4, are you fighting, and quarreling in the church?
[time=2453] Are you getting caught with your lusts and your desires, and you don't have it, so you fight for it?
[time=2462] Also in Chapter 4, are you making plans for your life as if God doesn't exist?
[time=2467] The college you want to go to, the business you want to start, the vacation you want to take, the person you'd like to marry?
[time=2474] Are you just kind of just independently firing these decisions out as if God doesn't exist?
[time=2479] If that's your pattern, my friend, it's a long way from how Christian makes his plans.
[time=2486] Chapter 5, are you patient when wronged by people?
[time=2489] Can you be wronged by people?
[time=2491] Can you be wrong by people when it's not even your fault?
[time=2494] You deserve it, you didn't bring it on yourself, it wasn't that you were a jerk or disobedient or unfaithful to an employee, I mean you were doing everything you were supposed to do, but you had some people who were mistreating you, are you patient?
[time=2506] Christians are patient.
[time=2508] Christians endure that kind of stuff.
[time=2510] Christians stay under that kind of stuff, as they hope for the coming of the Lord.
[time=2514] And this last one there, in 5/12, do you tell the truth?
[time=2522] Are you coming up with some kind of a crazy swear system so you can lie to yourself and lie to others, maintain the pretense of religion and piety?
[time=2530] Do you tell yourself the truth about you?
[time=2537] Are you honestly embracing the truth, willing to repent, asking for the power and the strength to grow?
[time=2543] These are what Christians do, these are the 11 things that James, out of a zillion things, chooses to highlight to say, "Hey, what does a real Christian do?
[time=2551] How would I test my faith to see if it is a living faith?"
[time=2560] See, it's not a popular message.
[time=2562] It's not a feel-good book.
[time=2564] It's a book of warning, a book of lifestyle tests.
[time=2568] But he does it because he cares and he wants these people to be able to see their true condition,
[time=2575] their soul.
[time=2577] If they failed these tests, any one of them grossly, any number of them into some measure,
[time=2583] they have real serious cause to question whether or not they're truly born again.
[time=2588] And he wants them to question that because he doesn't want them to go to hell.
[time=2594] Major question number three here, what can be done for these people?
[time=2599] Can these people be helped?
[time=2601] Well, it seems as though he's implying something in this letter.
[time=2605] He's implying almost now, I've written the standard, okay?
[time=2609] I've laid out the 11 tests.
[time=2611] I've kind of done my work here.
[time=2613] I mean, I've laid the standard of truth out here for all of us because, you know, this would come to these Christians.
[time=2618] They would read it.
[time=2619] It would be preached on.
[time=2620] And everybody would know this now.
[time=2622] Here's the standard.
[time=2623] But now look at, he seems to imply it's someone else's job to help these poor people.
[time=2630] Look at verse 19, "My brethren, if any among you strays from the truth and one," that's kind of an indescript little title.
[time=2637] Just a one.
[time=2638] And one turns him back, verse 20, "let him know that he who," there's another indescriptive little title, "turns the sinner from the air of his way, will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins." I feel like he is both justifying why he wrote the book in the first place.
[time=2655] Don't be mad at me for being so harsh and honest and stern and getting the rubber down there where it meets the road.
[time=2660] I'm just trying to save a soul from death.
[time=2662] And by the way, feel free to jump in the game any time, you know?
[time=2666] I mean, feel free to be a one there in verse 19 who turns one of these brothers back.
[time=2671] Feel free to be a he-who there in verse 20 who turns the sinner from the air of his way.
[time=2678] He doesn't say this is the job of the elders like he did in verse 14.
[time=2682] He doesn't say this is the job of the deacons.
[time=2684] He doesn't say this is the job of the preacher or the pastor or the staff guys or the ABF leaders.
[time=2689] He says, "One, he-who." It's just like this.
[time=2694] Let's go.
[time=2695] Let's do this together.
[time=2696] Whoever's closest to these people, whoever knows these people, whoever understands these people, you're on.
[time=2704] Go get them.
[time=2707] The truth has been taught.
[time=2708] The standard has been lifted up.
[time=2710] God has been honored in declaring what truly constitutes the tests of a living faith.
[time=2715] Now, look around.
[time=2718] Who is missing the mark?
[time=2719] Who's straying from the truth?
[time=2721] Who's turning to his own way?
[time=2723] Who's characteristically sitting?
[time=2724] Go get him.
[time=2726] Go get her.
[time=2733] The major question number four here is, okay, what's the prize?
[time=2739] I mean, what's the result?
[time=2741] What happens?
[time=2742] Well, it's right there.
[time=2745] Turn him back.
[time=2746] He who turns a sinner from the air of his way.
[time=2748] The word is epistrefo there in the Greek.
[time=2750] It means to turn from sin to God.
[time=2753] It's the clear word of salvation, repentance.
[time=2756] In 1 Thessalonians 1-9, Paul is commending the Thessalonians for their remarkable conversion.
[time=2761] These folks were just like super saints.
[time=2763] They got saved, and they just proved it every day of their life.
[time=2766] They just lived with a remarkable obedience to God.
[time=2769] He says of them in 1 Thessalonians 1-9 using this word epistrefo.
[time=2773] How you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.
[time=2779] That's what happens.
[time=2781] You turn these people around.
[time=2784] In verse 25 of 1 Peter 2, the same word epistrefo.
[time=2788] For you were continually straying like sheep.
[time=2791] See, that's their condition.
[time=2792] That's very similar to what James is saying.
[time=2794] Got your own way.
[time=2795] You're a sinner.
[time=2796] You were continually straying like sheep.
[time=2798] Each of us is like a sheep.
[time=2800] Turned to his own way.
[time=2801] Each one of us has gone astray.
[time=2803] They're in Romans.
[time=2804] A quote from the Old Testament.
[time=2805] That's a description of depravity.
[time=2806] That's a description of an unregenerate state who continues to live in those obedience.
[time=2811] "But," he says, "now you have returned epistrefo to the shepherd and guardian of your souls."
[time=2819] You've made it about face.
[time=2821] You've come to the one and only place of healing.
[time=2824] The one and only place where you can really get that spiritual thirst thing resolved.
[time=2831] And he throws in as a bonus there at the end of verse 20.
[time=2834] Cover a multitude of sins.
[time=2836] Which I don't think describes the condition of the sinner.
[time=2838] I think it describes the power of the grace that's involved here.
[time=2842] I mean, you're talking about the kind of grace that can cover a multitude, mountains.
[time=2847] Mounding mountains of sin.
[time=2852] Micah 718.
[time=2854] Who is a God like you?
[time=2859] Who pardons iniquity?
[time=2861] Where do you get off being like this God?
[time=2864] Where'd you get that idea?
[time=2865] I mean, how come you're that way?
[time=2867] Why are you the kind of God that says, "Okay, you're pardoned"?
[time=2872] How can you be so harsh in one instance where wrath is coming and a soul is being put to death?
[time=2878] And those who love you there in Psalms are crying out for those people to be punished because they've rebelled against you.
[time=2884] How can that be so right about you?
[time=2886] At the same time, you can be the kind of a God that pardons iniquity.
[time=2889] And of course, we understand that.
[time=2891] He resolves all of that in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2894] And when a person is rightly related to Christ, what an awesome God pardoning the iniquity.
[time=2907] It's just mind-boggling that he is so decisive, so complete in his forgiveness, his covering.
[time=2913] He doesn't kind of remember them.
[time=2914] You remember this Psalm 103.
[time=2916] He has not dealt with us according to our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[time=2920] I mean, we deserve horrible things.
[time=2922] But here it comes, "For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his loving kindness towards those who fear him."
[time=2929] By the way, that's an Old Testament phrase for salvation, to fear God.
[time=2933] As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
[time=2939] Just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[time=2944] For he himself knows our frame.
[time=2946] He is mindful that we are but dust.
[time=2951] The gold, the prize, the wonderful reality is that you and I somehow, some way in the mystery of God, can be used to turn a sinner back.
[time=2962] So we can be properly and truly converted, born again, and then the soul is saved from death, and then the marvelous grace of God covers a multitude of sins.
[time=2974] Let me conclude with like three suggestions.
[time=2980] I'm hoping, I'm thinking, I'm probably, you got a face there in your mind somewhere that's fitting this description.
[time=2987] And you probably don't want me to do this, but I'm going to just go ahead and do it anyway.
[time=2991] I'd like to ask you on the authority of God's Word to pursue that person this week.
[time=2999] And just not asking, I'd like to give you three suggestions as to options as to how you might do that.
[time=3005] If you'd be willing to try this, I think God would be glorified.
[time=3008] I think you would be built up and we just may see a sinner turn from the era of his way.
[time=3014] Okay, option number one, it's called the let's go have fun option.
[time=3020] And that's where you call this person up who may still be in the church, who may not be in the church, who you may not have seen for quite a little bit of time, and you do what you used to do with them.
[time=3029] If you golf, you, well you don't anymore because it's too cold, but if you go shopping, you shop.
[time=3034] If you go to movies, you go to a movie.
[time=3036] If you do some type of sport, you go do that kind of sport and you resist the temptation, you just say no to it.
[time=3042] Every time you want to ask them about their spiritual life, don't do it, and you watch by the end of the evening, that person will be so bothered that you haven't asked, they'll tell you.
[time=3049] Okay, they'll bring it up, it'll just burn a hole right in their heart.
[time=3054] You just have fun, you just like old times, go get them, and let them suffer under your goodness.
[time=3064] Okay, by the time you're done, whether it's the first or the second time, it'll have to come out.
[time=3071] The second option is alcohol that lets do coffee option.
[time=3078] It's, you got to pretend for a minute, just before you're picking that phone up to initiate this, that it's a person that hasn't strayed for the truth, that's one of your better friends, that just to get the tension out of the conversation, and just say hey, how you been?
[time=3092] I've kind of lost touch with you, I'd love to catch up.
[time=3096] Could we grab a bite or do coffee here in the next couple of days, and I just love to hear what's been going on in your life?
[time=3104] Now, you know how good it's going to be for people in this condition to have to report back to you, just in a friendly way, what they've been doing for the last six, twelve months, two, three, four years?
[time=3115] They know who you are, they know what you believe and what they used to say they believe, and do you know that they probably haven't sat down and honestly done this with anybody much less themselves?
[time=3125] And you just ask them questions that unbelievers ask each other questions.
[time=3128] This doesn't have to be scary or super spiritual, just ask them things like, are you happy?
[time=3134] How are your relationships doing?
[time=3137] Are you enjoying your life?
[time=3140] Are you satisfied with the kinds of choices you've been making?
[time=3143] Now see, unbelievers ask, unbelievers, those kinds of questions over coffee all the time.
[time=3150] There's nothing super spiritual, but you watch.
[time=3154] A person starts to answer those questions with you, there's a loving, forgiving, hard inside of you, who knows what might happen.
[time=3162] The last option, option number three.
[time=3165] This might best be called the Hiroshima option.
[time=3171] This is where you look a little bit more like Nathan than anybody else in the Old Testament as he approached David and said thou art the one.
[time=3179] And you've got to be Holy Spirit led on this one as you should be on the others.
[time=3184] But you've got to have a sense that God just wants you to get in this particular person's face still with love, cut the anger, and just say hey, where have you been?
[time=3193] And what in the world are you doing to yourself and your life?
[time=3198] Look at you, you scoundrel.
[time=3201] What have you been up to?
[time=3203] Look at the choices you've been making.
[time=3205] What happened to this? What happened to us? What happened to Christ?
[time=3211] Just see what happens.
[time=3215] Be Holy Spirit led and be prepared to duck quick.
[time=3220] I don't know which is the right option.
[time=3222] And maybe you have a fourth option that's better.
[time=3224] Use it.
[time=3226] Let's pray together.
[time=3234] Let me just, with your heads bowed there and your eyes closed.
[time=3240] This is no fun.
[time=3242] This takes time. I know it's the holidays.
[time=3246] I know, I know all that stuff.
[time=3248] You want to know why I know that?
[time=3249] Because the Lord has laid the same person on my heart during both services.
[time=3254] And I have to covenant with him to make a call this week.
[time=3258] And I don't want to in one sense for all the reasons I just listed.
[time=3263] Probably the most of which is it intimidates me to death.
[time=3268] But I want to give you a chance here to worship God.
[time=3271] In a real and a meaningful way.
[time=3274] His word couldn't be any clearer.
[time=3276] And if he's put a face in your mind, I want to give you a chance to covenant with God.
[time=3284] To give that person a call this week.
[time=3287] Not between now and new years, but this week.
[time=3292] And take one of those options or come up with a fourth one.
[time=3295] Now see what that'll do for you.
[time=3298] Is that it'll let you honor God with your life as a result of your worship experience today.
[time=3302] It'll be more than just coming and hearing and evaluating whether or not I did a good job.
[time=3307] Whether or not we sang the right songs.
[time=3310] Whether or not you got to sit in the right pew.
[time=3313] It'll give you a chance to interact with the true and living God in a very vital and a very meaningful way.
[time=3320] If he's landed on your heart, now if he's not, then don't worry about what I'm saying.
[time=3325] But if he's landed on your heart, I invite you to make a covenant with him right now.
[time=3330] And the next seven days God a call will be made to so and so.
[time=3336] If you've just made that covenant, ask him to bless it now.
[time=3340] Go before you. Prepare the way.
[time=3343] Lord, thank you for the chance to meet together, to pray together, to sing together,
[time=3349] to hear your word together and hopefully to respond together.
[time=3353] And Lord, I just got to know that maybe by next week there'd be another person sitting here because they got saved.
[time=3360] Because the Christian went after him, brought him back to the good shepherd, the guardian of our souls.
[time=3368] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3375] Well, what an interesting perspective we gained from the Book of James.
[time=3379] And I certainly part from the Book of James with a bit of sadness in my heart.
[time=3382] I'm sorry we've concluded the study.
[time=3384] I've so enjoyed it and thank the Lord for the impact that it's had on my life.
[time=3388] As you can tell, James is concerned that there would be people who make a profession of faith but who are not truly saved,
[time=3394] who may have had some association with the church in days gone by but have not been truly saved.
[time=3400] And I would just ask and invite you as we close this Book of James today to take inventory of your spiritual life.
[time=3406] Are you certain you're saved?
[time=3408] You have a peace that you are right with God.
[time=3410] Do you sense that you are free from the power of sin?
[time=3413] And by that, I don't mean that you never sin, but that you're clearly breaking the patterns of sin in your life and with time you're growing to look more like Christ.
[time=3421] Are you confident that you're truly saved?
[time=3423] If you're not, and you'd like to be sure of that, or if you've never prayed to receive Christ and would like to do that with me right now,
[time=3429] I invite you to bow your heads as we have a word of prayer and invite Christ into your life.
[time=3434] Let's pray together.
[time=3436] Father, I recognize that I am sinful.
[time=3439] I recognize that I have violated your divine law and I desire for forgiveness to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3446] I want to be washed and cleansed and made new and have a fresh start in life and know that the power of God resides within me
[time=3454] to give me the power and the strength to live differently.
[time=3457] I accept Christ as my personal Lord and Savior and invite him into my heart.
[time=3461] I give him complete control over my life.
[time=3464] I submit myself through this to the Word of God and the truth in God's Word and praise you for it in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3473] Well, if you prayed to receive that prayer, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=3476] Write us here at the Bible hour and let us know about that decision.
[time=3480] In a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive an audio cassette copy of The Living Christmas Tree.
[time=3487] Or if you've prayed today to receive Christ as your Savior, we'll send you the booklet Lessons on Assurance Absolutely Free.
