[time=0] It's amazing, isn't it?
[time=4] There is this great testimony, there is this great power, I mean, the probability that any one individual, before he is even two years old, by events which he himself could
[time=15] not orchestrate, could fulfill four direct prophecies is absolutely astounding.
[time=21] It is a great apologetic to the fact that you and I are worshiping the right one, the
[time=27] right king.
[time=29] He is, in fact, Lord of Lords.
[time=36] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=40] We're glad you joined us today.
[time=42] As we approach the Christmas season, many of us look forward to celebrating the coming of a king.
[time=47] We're thankful that Christ has come to be the Savior of the world.
[time=51] Yet for many of us, there's still a resistance to his being king of our lives, having full control of our day-to-day affairs.
[time=59] We'll stay with us today as past or more helps us learn ways to fully surrender to Christ the king.
[time=66] But first, let's listen to the men of reflection as they sing, "Let all mortal flesh." Let all mortal flesh keep silent and with fear and trembling sin.
[time=86] Under nothing earthly minded, for we're blessing in His hand.
[time=105] Christ our Lord to earth, He said, "Then our full homage to the men."
[time=114] King of Kings, yet born of Mary, as of all on earth, He's true.
[time=130] Lord affords in human rescue in the body and the heart, He will give to all the faithful
[time=148] who live in the body and the heart, He will give to all the people who live in the body.
[time=171] Lord, they will give to all the people who live in the body and the heart, He will give
[time=184] to all the people who live in the body and the heart, He will give to all the people
[time=197] who live in the body and the heart, He will give to all the people who live in the body
[time=209] and the heart, He will give to all the people who live in the body and the heart, He will
[time=217] give to all the people who live in the body and the heart, He will give to all the people who live in the body and the heart, He will give to all the people who live in the body.
[time=226] And there were in the same country shepherds riding in the field, keeping watch over their
[time=232] flock by night and lo and angel of the Lord came upon them and they were so afraid and
[time=238] the angel said, "Fear not or behold, I bring you good news of a great joy which shall be
[time=244] to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior who is Christ
[time=253] of the Lord."
[time=259] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts.
[time=283] Praising God and saying, "Lory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good will to
[time=290] men." Praising God, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus,
[time=496] Our service will continue in just a moment.

[time=715] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour and thank you for tuning in today.
[time=720] As we approach this Christmas season, I just want to invite you to come and be a part of two special services in our church, if you're free and have nothing else to do.
[time=728] We'd love for you to join us on Christmas Eve, we're going to have a candlelit communion service and if you'd love to stop by and enjoy that service with us at six o'clock,
[time=738] that Saturday evening Christmas Eve, we'd love for you to be a part of that.
[time=742] And then also on Christmas morning, we're going to have a very unusual morning here at Blackhawk Baptist Church, we're going to have a birthday party for our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=750] On Christmas morning at 1045, our service will start, it'll only be an hour long, we're
[time=756] planning some special things for the kids who will be a part of our service, some songs they'll sing and some interesting ways to involve them in the whole thing.
[time=763] So we invite you to be a part of that.
[time=765] Now let's go back to the regular scheduled portion of our program.
[time=776] [MUSIC]
[time=795] Dealing for the way studies, and his gentle touch of mercy, to wipe away our tears,
[time=820] please have a lasting rich and new.
[time=832] Even through the darkest hours, his shall end all.
[time=845] All sufficient grace and mind.
[time=857] Strain and forgiveness through his blood, all eyes in Christ.
[time=874] He is the victory, the source of all we are, and all we'll ever hold to be.
[time=894] Our provider, deliver and garnering King, as in Christ who is the reason we seek.
[time=920] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=932] Come, let the broken heart rejoice.
[time=942] All eyes in Christ.
[time=949] He is the victory, the source of all we are, and all we'll ever hold to be.
[time=969] Our provider, deliver and garnering King, as in Christ who is the reason we seek.
[time=994] Our same Christ who is the reason we seek.
[time=1004] We seek, we seek.
[time=1019] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1022] And come to Matthew chapter two, I want to get a head start into the Christmas season,
[time=1028] and come to the wonderful and well-known passage in Matthew chapter two.
[time=1034] Before we look at the details, I just need you to understand, and for your sake, to gain the most out of what Matthew has written here in chapter two, you really have to understand what he has written in Matthew one through nine, chapters one through nine, because there's a marvelous thing going on here, a marvelous flow of thought that he is articulating so wonderfully.
[time=1054] And he is declaring Christ as King.
[time=1058] He is lifting up this little infant here in chapter two and saying to all who would read this book
[time=1064] that this one who was born in the most humble of ways and the most simple conditions is in fact the King of kings and the Lord of lords.
[time=1073] Now, I don't know how many of you have had a chance to see the Lion King, Walt Disney's Lion King, but I saw it for the second time this week.
[time=1081] My youngest daughter Whitney turned five, and so we had the special father-daughter date, you understand, and she didn't know where we were going.
[time=1087] It was the mystery trip, and there we were, at Lion King.
[time=1090] And I had been studying this passage all week, and so it kind of exploded in my mind that the way this wonderful movie opens up, there is the great Mufasa,
[time=1101] and he is the king of the beast.
[time=1103] He is the great lion who roars and rules all of the kingdom.
[time=1107] And as the movie opens, all of the animal kingdom, all the giraffes and zebras and the elephants
[time=1113] and the chimpanzees and the cheetahs are out in front because they are the fastest.
[time=1117] I mean, they are just breakneck speed moving to this place called Pride Rock, which is this magnificent mountain with a great cliff, and jutting out horizontally from it is this arm of sheer, what might be granite, just protruding out into space.
[time=1132] And at the edge of that stands the great King Mufasa.
[time=1136] They all come into the plains and they are all waiting for something great to happen, but nothing happens.
[time=1142] And tell this baboon shows up, who is the wise man.
[time=1146] He is the mystic, he is the king maker, he is the medicine man.
[time=1151] He comes with his crook, with a couple of gourds tied to it.
[time=1154] His name is Rafaki, or excuse me, Rafaki.
[time=1158] And Rafaki climbs up this great slope and walks past Mufasa back into the cave itself
[time=1164] and there is the little prince, the little lion cub.
[time=1168] And this is the new one who was born, the one, the heir to the throne.
[time=1172] Simba is the name of this little lion.
[time=1174] And the mystic, the magic man, looks over him and breaks the gourd and pours some stuff on his head, you know, on ceremony stuff and sprinkles the dust.
[time=1183] And then he confirms, you see, this is the king, the new king, this little itty bitty thing.
[time=1191] But all the animal kingdom waits.
[time=1194] And so Rafaki comes with his little lion cub and comes to the edge of this protruding arm of granite and stands out there with these animals just gathered all around and finally lifts up the little lion cub and the place just goes nuts, you know.
[time=1208] The elephants blow their horns and the zebras do their thing and they're pawn in the dust and there's dancing out there and they just can't believe that they now have the successor and there he is.
[time=1218] Well that is exactly what Rafaki was doing for we humans.
[time=1223] Rafaki was saying that what we have here in this little infant is truly the king of kings and the response should be adoration and worship and love and saying this is the one we will eventually follow when he comes to that point in his life when his father, the king, is dead.
[time=1239] And of course the analogy breaks down there because God the father never dies.
[time=1243] In chapter 1, Matthew says this little infant is the king because he has the right genealogy.
[time=1249] Christ comes down through the lines of Israel's history as he must, as the Messiah must, and he fulfills all the requirements of being born into the right family.
[time=1257] He has royal blood.
[time=1259] In chapter 2 it indicates that he fulfills Old Testament prophecy as the Messiah would have to do.
[time=1264] In chapter 3 the Messiah is confirmed by God himself on high.
[time=1268] The heavens open up and God speaks audibly to the people and says this is my beloved son
[time=1274] in whom I am well pleased.
[time=1276] This is indeed the king.
[time=1277] In chapter 4 the king now full grown Jesus Christ, about 30 years of age gets led off into the wilderness
[time=1283] and is tempted by Satan himself.
[time=1286] This is a face to face combat of good and evil.
[time=1289] And the Lord emerges pure and is able to say I am morally qualified to be your king.
[time=1295] I can be the true righteous one who will die for the sins of the world because I have been tempted by the tempter himself and been utterly successful.
[time=1304] In chapters 5, 6 and 7 you have the preaching of the king.
[time=1307] And Jesus clarifies for all who would listen if you're going to be in my kingdom.
[time=1311] If you're going to be one of my subjects and inherit the kingdom of God, this is what you must live like.
[time=1316] This is the righteousness that must characterize you if you would be in my kingdom.
[time=1320] And then chapters 8 and 9 of Matthew, we see the power of the king and he does all these wonderful miracles casting out demons and healing the sick and raising the dead.
[time=1328] And there's just no question.
[time=1330] Matthew is just lifting him up for all the world to see that they should all just bow down in worship saying yeah, there's our king.
[time=1337] Here's the one, this is the new king.
[time=1342] Matthew chapter 2 makes a unique contribution to this because in Matthew 2 the Lord, as an infant now,
[time=1349] fulfills for Old Testament prophecies.
[time=1353] I mean, he can't control where he's born, but he's born in the right place in Bethlehem, verse 5.
[time=1359] For so it has been written by the prophet and you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders of Judah.
[time=1365] For out of you shall come forth a ruler, capital R, who will shepherd my people, Israel.
[time=1370] How does somebody control where they're born?
[time=1372] Did you have any say over where you were born?
[time=1375] Of course not. One of 330 Old Testament prophecies right there off the bat, another one there in verse 15.
[time=1382] It was prophesied that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophets might be fulfilled saying out of Egypt that I call my son.
[time=1391] Now you got this little infant who cannot say whether he's going to get up in the morning or go to bed at night, can't ask for anything to eat.
[time=1397] But because of circumstances his family takes him into Egypt even as it was predicted by Hosea in chapter 11, verse 1.
[time=1404] And so it's true that he has fulfilled that Old Testament prophecy.
[time=1409] In verse 17 then that which is spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled saying a voice was heard in Rama weeping in great morning.
[time=1417] Rachel weeping for her children and she refused to be comforted because they were no more.
[time=1423] An Old Testament prophecy made by Jeremiah which is not recorded for us except for Jeremiah 31.
[time=1430] The idea here is when Herod sends his henchmen into Bethlehem and they kill every male child two years and under.
[time=1437] The weeping is unbelievable, the morning is unbelievable, the mothers will not be comforted and Rachel stands kind of personified as the femininity of Israel weeping for the loss of her children.
[time=1447] Another, a third in fact, prophecy of the Old Testament that the Lord fulfilled before he was two.
[time=1454] And the fourth verse 23 came and resided in a city called Nazareth.
[time=1459] That was spoken through the prophets might be fulfilled, he shall be called a Nazarene. That's where he grew up.
[time=1465] It's absolutely astounding if you know anything about business and if you study probabilities at all it is just mind boggling that the same individual before he is two could fulfill four prophecies made
[time=1476] some six, some nine, some thousand years before his birth and the one, the leading one is the place of his birth.
[time=1484] There's no question. Matthew said here, see this? This is the king.
[time=1489] This is the Messiah. Make no mistake about it. When you give your life to him, when you submit your power and your control, the sway of your life to this one, you have done it to the true and living king.
[time=1501] No imposter. You have no questions about his identity.
[time=1508] But I've entitled my message today, who will be king?
[time=1513] Because there is a subplot that is very intriguing that runs all the way through the chapter, Matthew 2, and it involves Herod, who Herod the king he's called in verse 1.
[time=1527] And he's not so sure about this newly born king. He's not so sure he wants to give up his rule of Palestine to this new little infant.
[time=1540] And like Scar in the movie Lion King, who then went on to challenge the newborn king, this is a common theme throughout history.
[time=1550] People who have a rule, people who have a domain, people who have something over which they are in control of tend to be pretty threatened and are not too ready to give control to another.
[time=1560] And so what we find here in Herod has played itself out through the centuries.
[time=1565] We can pick the narrative up here in verse 1. Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem saying, where is he who was born king of the Jews?
[time=1578] For we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.
[time=1584] Just like in the movie, there have been throughout the centuries of time the king makers, those who are supposed to have special insight from the gods.
[time=1594] And they come to the one who would claim to be the king and they do something, they indicate somehow that, yeah, this isn't just the individual saying he would be king, but we have information from on high that this is the king.
[time=1607] That is the very sensitive role that these Magi play in this particular event.
[time=1614] They are called wise men, we three kings, we don't know that there were three, that's tradition.
[time=1619] But we do know they were brilliant men, men of science, men of agriculture, men of mathematics, men of history, men of astronomy and men of astrology, brilliant individuals with great vasts of learning at their command.
[time=1634] We don't know how God communicated through the star, we don't know exactly what was going on, but they were obviously studying the heavens and they were, they were clued in, they were communicated with by God that the king of the Jews had been born.
[time=1649] And what is a greater mystery to me is why were they even looking for the king of the Jews?
[time=1655] I mean, why would these people in the east over towards Babylon, why would they even be searching the sky for indications as to a king who would be born to a very obscure little people somewhere in Palestine under the rule of another nation called Rome?
[time=1670] I mean, what's all that about, where does that come from?
[time=1674] We don't know for certain, but it may have been that these very Magi were God-fearing Gentiles who had been strongly influenced by the legacy of Daniel.
[time=1684] Who himself was deported to the east over there in Babylon.
[time=1689] And he, as you might recall, they're in the early chapters of Daniel, saved the necks of the Magi in Nebuchadnezzar's reign because they were unable to interpret the dream or give the meaning thereof.
[time=1700] And they were on the chopping block, they were ready to be executed for their inability to perform their Magi function.
[time=1706] Daniel from God received the dream and the interpretation and gave both and their lives, the Magi's lives, were spared.
[time=1716] It's not hard to assume then that Daniel was highly revered by the Magi.
[time=1721] In fact, the plot that comes against Daniel, I think in Daniel 5 or 6 when he's going to be thrown into the lions den, it is listed there that the Magi had nothing to do with it.
[time=1730] It was the sat-traps and the commissioners who wanted him dead, but the Magi's are conspicuously missing.
[time=1736] They may have greatly appreciated honored and revered this great dreamer or interpreter of dreams.
[time=1742] So was Daniel, this marvelous statesman, who not only interpreted the dream of the king, gave great leadership and eventually wrote a book called the Book of Daniel.
[time=1753] And it is not hard to understand that these Magi may have had that among their library and among the things in which they would study.
[time=1760] And when eventually the Jews did get to leave their Babylonian captivity, great numbers of them stayed in the east.
[time=1766] And so there may have been a large contingent of Jews even to this day, still living in the east, keeping alive their flame of Jehovah and the Messiah and the coming king.
[time=1778] But it's quite possible that the reason these Magi were looking for such indications of a king is because they had studied the prophecies of Daniel.
[time=1786] They had heard from their Jewish friends and neighbors the hope and the promise of the coming Messiah.
[time=1793] They would no doubt have been men of great wealth. They were powerful individuals, great prestige, and they would have traveled with many servants and a whole platoon of soldiers.
[time=1804] Or they were carrying very expensive gifts and those were very dangerous territories to move in and about without some type of support.
[time=1812] So they come into this little town, Jerusalem, and they make quite a stink when they come.
[time=1817] I mean, they are not just slipping in unawares. They are making a great presence when they enter into the city.
[time=1823] And they start asking this question.
[time=1825] Verse 2, "Where is he who was born king of the Jews, for we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him?"
[time=1832] Verse 3, "When Herod the king heard it, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him."
[time=1838] When you read the word troubled, you could read panic-stricken, incredibly anxious, terrified, very upset.
[time=1847] And I believe that the people in Jerusalem were likewise troubled, not because of the Magi.
[time=1852] They were troubled because Herod was troubled.
[time=1856] And whenever Herod got troubled, it usually meant somebody was going to die. Somebody was going to be in trouble.
[time=1862] You see, Herod, you could sum up his entire life. By this time, he's 70 years old. He's been in power now for 30 years.
[time=1869] His whole life can be summed up in two very simple words, power and control.
[time=1876] He was a politician, power and control.
[time=1880] In fact, his father was a political leader and held a position of political power.
[time=1885] And so he was raised in the household of power and control.
[time=1889] And you can imagine that around the dinner table, or as they would take walks, or as they would go on trips together, or as his father would come home in the evening, the discussion would be all about power and control.
[time=1899] How to gain it, how to attain it, how to maintain it, how to defend against its being taken away from you.
[time=1905] This was who this man was. He was a power and control freak.
[time=1909] In fact, he saw his own father die in an assassination plot by his political enemies.
[time=1917] His father was poisoned. And it seems to have had quite an impact over Herod.
[time=1924] Herod was actually an Edomite. He was not a Jew. He had no business ruling over the Jews, except for the power of Rome.
[time=1930] When Rome declared him king of the Jews and gave him jurisdiction over Palestine, it was inhabited by the Parthians,
[time=1936] another invading group of people, who he then had to spend two years in heavy combat and much bloodshed driving these people out of Jerusalem.
[time=1946] So he actually comes into power his own through bloodshed.
[time=1951] He then held an inaugural ball for himself and invited everybody who had had anything to do with the murder of his father to this particular ball,
[time=1962] or this party, or whatever it was. And those who were invited and who were coming might have assumed that Herod was now going to try to make some type of perverted alliance with them.
[time=1971] As if to say, "The dastardly deed you did in my father's life, I will now need you to do in other people's lives, and I want you with me not against me so come and let's make amends and we can work together."
[time=1982] But instead, when those people showed up, they were greeted by professional hitmen and slaughtered at the party.
[time=1988] He was bloodthirsty. He then married for power and control.
[time=1992] He married a Jewish woman not because he loved her, but because he thought it would assuage and build some type of endearment
[time=1998] of the hearts of the Jewish people because he had married one of their own, not for love, but for political gain.
[time=2007] Later, when there was a great plague while he was reigning there in Palestine and there was a great plague, it swept over the land and people were starving and people were going unclothed, they were naked.
[time=2018] He actually took gold out of his own palace and sold it so he could provide food and clothing for these people.
[time=2024] But as you'll see, not because he loved them, not because he wanted to serve them, but because he would do whatever he had to do
[time=2030] to stay in the place of power and control.
[time=2034] He even funded the reconstruction of the temple in Jerusalem with his own money.
[time=2038] He built theaters, he built a racetrack, he built other social points of gathering structures of sort.
[time=2044] But don't let those political poise mask in any way his true heart.
[time=2050] He was a murderer and he would do anything he had to do to stay in control.
[time=2055] For example, he killed his own brother-in-law. He married this woman and killed her brother.
[time=2059] He happened to have been the high priest and had done something that Herod didn't like, so he had him murdered.
[time=2064] But didn't want to appear to be as bloodthirsty as he was, so he showed up at his brother-in-law's funeral apparently weeping, trying again to win the favor of the people. He later went on to kill his mother-in-law.
[time=2074] I mean, you know, he got home from work one day, his wife said so. How was it today at the office? I mean, what did you do?
[time=2080] He said, well, I actually could have your mother. I mean, this is the kind of guy he was.
[time=2084] As time went on, he killed his own wife. They had three sons and he killed every single one of them.
[time=2091] The last son, he killed five days before his own death.
[time=2096] Herod had been on a sick bed for about a year, knew his time was coming to the end.
[time=2099] His son sensed that, got a little ambitious with the power and control thing, and his father had him executed.
[time=2104] Five days before he died.
[time=2108] Wicked heart.
[time=2110] Also in those last days of his life sensing that no one would mourn his passing, that when he died there would be a party in Jerusalem
[time=2117] instead of mourning and weeping and all the flute players and the professional mourners that should have been hired and all the rest.
[time=2122] You know what he did? He arrested all the favored sons of Palestine and Jerusalem.
[time=2128] All the gifted people, the musicians, the artists, the great thinkers, the leaders, the people that the society gravitated towards.
[time=2136] He hired, excuse me, he arrested all of them and then gave an order that at my death execute every single one of them
[time=2144] because this city will mourn when I die, whether they mourn for me or whether they mourn for their friends will be up to them.
[time=2151] Power and control.
[time=2155] No one was going to threaten that in his life. No one was going to take that away without a fight.
[time=2161] And what you see in verse 16 of Matthew 2 is another one of his incredible diabolical deeds.
[time=2167] Herod saw that he had been tricked by the Magi. He'd wanted to kill just the king himself but couldn't sow mass murder.
[time=2175] He became enraged and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its environs from two years old and under
[time=2184] according to the time which he had ascertained from the Magi.
[time=2189] Unbelievable. Now you understand?
[time=2192] Do you understand now why when the Magi came from the east saying, "Excuse me." We heard there's a new king. Could you point him out for us?
[time=2200] Can you understand now why Herod was troubled, panicked, stricken, absolutely out of his mind
[time=2207] and then therefore why the people would equally be troubled because they knew something was going to happen and it wasn't going to be good?
[time=2217] That sets the stage now to kind of look at this chapter.
[time=2222] And the question we'll answer or ask an answer is what does somebody do who has spent their whole life building, keeping and guarding their power?
[time=2230] And this is the marvelous thing about Scripture because it records the truth.
[time=2235] Because it is not some type of editorialized history with a particular bent to it that is to falsify the truth,
[time=2242] because it does the Scriptures edit and produce a consistent flow of thought to present the actual truth.
[time=2249] You can learn volumes even on the subplot.
[time=2252] So the question is what does a person like Herod do, a person who is into power and control?
[time=2257] How do they respond when that is threatened?
[time=2260] And by the way, these same three things are what anyone and everyone does.
[time=2266] Who is threatened?
[time=2269] Anyone who is power and control is threatened, you'll find them doing these same three things.
[time=2273] The first one in verse four.
[time=2275] Gathering together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he began to inquire of them where the Christ was to be born.
[time=2284] In other words, he's got to identify, if he's going to kill this kid, he's got to know where he is.
[time=2289] He doesn't know where he is.
[time=2290] So he figures while the people who know where he is are going to be the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=2294] And he calls them together and says consult your sacred books, consult your Bible, consult your Old Testament, so that you can tell me where this thing is going to be born, where this thing is going to happen.
[time=2304] And they do and they come back and they say out of Micah 5.2, Bethlehem.
[time=2308] It's just thank you very much. I appreciate your help.
[time=2311] And what he has effectively done is he now has assembled the first crosshair in his sight of his power pistol, if you will,
[time=2318] so he'll know where to pull the trigger.
[time=2321] And what has he done in the process? And this is the first thing that power hungry people do, people who are into power and control.
[time=2327] He has used them. He has used these people, these religious leaders.
[time=2332] He wasn't interested in the king of the Jews for the sake of the king of the Jews.
[time=2336] He was interested in the king of the Jews and the location of his birth so he could murder him and he had to use some people to determine where that was.
[time=2343] And that's what people always do.
[time=2345] Whenever people are after power and control, they always use other people. They don't serve, they don't minister, they don't give, they just use people.
[time=2352] The second thing he does is he calls the Magi because he now knows the location but what he needs to know is the time.
[time=2359] So verse 7, Herod secretly called the Magi and ascertained from them the time the star had appeared.
[time=2367] And then he goes on and he sent them to Bethlehem and said go and make careful search for the child.
[time=2374] And when you have found him, report to me that I may to come and worship him.
[time=2380] Guess what that is? That's a lie. That is a bold face deception.
[time=2386] And that happens to be the second thing that people always do who are into power and control.
[time=2392] They use people and they lie to people. They deceive people.
[time=2398] That is exactly what he is doing here.
[time=2402] People who are protecting their power use people and they deceive people.
[time=2406] Well, as you know, they don't come back and tell him.
[time=2410] They get some information from the Lord that encourages them not to do so so they leave another way.
[time=2416] Verse 12, "And having been warned by God in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another way."
[time=2423] And now here comes the third thing that a person like Herod always does.
[time=2426] Verse 16, "Then when Herod saw that he had been tricked by the Magi, he became very angry, very enraged,
[time=2434] and sent and slew all the male children who were in Bethlehem and in all its environs from two years old and under,
[time=2441] according to the time which he had ascertained from the Magi.
[time=2446] Power and control hungry people always destroy other people.
[time=2454] They always destroy other people.
[time=2458] And this is some type of destruction. I don't know. This would not go over well with us.
[time=2462] I mean, we have a 16-month-old boy. He'd be gone.
[time=2467] He'd be sitting there eating our supper and there'd be a knock on the door and there'd be some armed people sent outside their door and they'd bust in there and they'd see my little Bobby sitting at that table and they'd kill him.
[time=2478] They'd destroy him and they'd do that to your son, had you won that age at that particular time.
[time=2483] It would not have been a day they would have forgotten there.
[time=2487] The third mark of Herod's lust for power is he destroys people who threaten it.
[time=2494] Okay? Do you understand who this guy is?
[time=2497] It's a clear composite picture of what power hungry people do.
[time=2502] They use people, they deceive people, and they destroy people.
[time=2508] Now they don't always murder them, but they destroy them.
[time=2514] Herod was troubled by Christ. Christ showed up on the scene.
[time=2518] The new king. The new king. He came to confront those who wear crowns.
[time=2524] That's what Christ did. Christ came to confront people who wear crowns.
[time=2528] Those who want the power and those who want to be in control, Christ automatically is in a confrontation mode with them.
[time=2535] And they will either bow down and worship him or they will have to start their deal with him and start using people and deceiving people and destroying people.
[time=2545] So what you say? So that's what power hungry people do. So what's the big deal?
[time=2554] Let me suggest this to you this morning.
[time=2557] I think that there's a little bit of Herod in each one of us.
[time=2564] I think there's a little bit of Herod's heart in each one of our hearts.
[time=2570] Not to the extreme that Herod went, but I think all of us have areas of our lives that we really want to be in control of.
[time=2582] I think each and every one of us has areas in our lives that we want to have the power over.
[time=2589] And when Christ shows up and says, "I'm the king," I mean, I ought to have sway over this area of our lives.
[time=2599] We do the Herod thing. We say, "No, not so fast." No, not so fast. Hold on. We're going to bolt this thing down.
[time=2608] We're not giving up control of this particular area of our lives.
[time=2611] And for some of you who may not have ever really come to Christ, it may be your entire life.
[time=2617] You're saying not just a category of your life.
[time=2619] You're saying every single area of your life, you want nothing to do with this new king who showed up.
[time=2625] You are king. You are sovereign.
[time=2628] It is your domain for power and control, and you'll not be relinquishing it to another.
[time=2636] Well, see if I can be a little more practical.
[time=2639] I want to offer you the Herod Hart inventory. How can I find the areas in my life where I might be tempted to want power and control?
[time=2653] How can I find the area where I might be bothered by the notion of Christ taking control?
[time=2660] Because for many of us, we want to openly say, "Hey, Lord, I want you to have control of all of my life."
[time=2666] But in reality, we might be holding back in some areas.
[time=2669] So let me give you three questions, and I think I'll help you determine areas, pinpoint really areas in your life,
[time=2675] where you're not interested in having another king, where you in fact are pretty committed to being in the power seat and having full control.
[time=2684] Question number one.
[time=2686] In what area of your life do you have a tendency to use people?
[time=2692] In what area of your life do you have a tendency to use people where you are not there for them,
[time=2699] where you are not there to make an investment in their life, where they fit in your life simply because they will help you get something that you want?
[time=2709] Even if it's a good thing that you want, but they are in your life because they help you accomplish your goals.
[time=2716] Let me suggest to you that right behind that little spot is a part of you that wants to have control.
[time=2724] If you can just honestly look at the people in your life and find the ones that you're using,
[time=2731] I think if you look right behind that, maybe it's your future in the marketplace.
[time=2738] And you're not giving that up to anybody. That's a little too scary, okay?
[time=2745] You're talking about my standard of living here. You're talking about my reputation.
[time=2748] You're talking about my profession.
[time=2752] And you better believe I use and manipulate people in the marketplace because I'm not going to be subject to the whims of the situation.
[time=2760] No, sir, not me.
[time=2765] So you violate God's word because you're using and you're manipulating people there.
[time=2772] Maybe it's the way you think your kids ought to grow up and turn out and act and be.
[time=2779] And you're saying with as much intensity if you think for one minute I'm in a relinquish control.
[time=2785] Now there's a difference between being a parent who guides and leads and disciplines and a parent who tries to power and control the situation.
[time=2792] There's a big difference between those two things, but with equal energy you say you've got to be nuts.
[time=2797] I'm not leaving that one up for chance.
[time=2800] My whole identity rests on that my kids turn out the way I think they should turn out.
[time=2806] And so you power up and you take control and it affects the state of Christ.
[time=2812] If you want to help that's fine, but I got this one.
[time=2817] Maybe it's how the holidays will go this year. I've been thinking a little bit about this one.
[time=2821] Relatives come in, family members come in and the whole thing starts to do this and it does that.
[time=2827] And you may find that in years past you have been pretty manipulative.
[time=2832] That you have been using people.
[time=2835] That you have been saying things that are not true and orchestrating things in such a way that you can minimize the damage through this holiday season and make it out the other end without killing your in-laws.
[time=2845] Or whoever it is that's coming to town.
[time=2849] Hey just look a little behind that.
[time=2852] What is it that's in there?
[time=2855] That is so terrifying and what makes you feel so threatened to genuinely just freely give and let God be in control.
[time=2863] Let Christ let this thing turn out however it's going to turn out.
[time=2870] You want it to go your way and then Christ comes along and confronts your throne and says I want control.
[time=2878] Here's the second question.
[time=2882] What area do you tend to deceive people in?
[time=2888] What area of your life do you tend to have to kind of keep under wraps?
[time=2893] Keep there behind closed doors.
[time=2895] Usually deception is hiding an area that reveals your fear because you know if you put it out in the open you lose a measure of power and control over that thing.
[time=2906] You'd have to stop doing it.
[time=2908] Some aspect of your life that you don't want to open up to even a friend or a loved one.
[time=2913] Because if they knew how you were really doing in that area it would shatter the facade and you'd lose your ability to control it the way you want to control it.
[time=2922] And so you hide it inside of you.
[time=2924] You deceive people.
[time=2926] Maybe it's how you steward your money.
[time=2929] Maybe that's the best kept secret in your life because you are not going to lose control over how you use your money.
[time=2936] And so there is another person on this earth who knows how you give or how you don't give.
[time=2942] Where you spend your money and where you don't spend your money because you're just not interested in having anybody from the outside take a look at that.
[time=2949] Much less Christ himself.
[time=2951] And so you have to deceive people and you make it seem as if you do things with your money that are different than you really do.
[time=2961] Maybe it's how you use your time.
[time=2964] Maybe the Lord has come to you and said I want to be the Lord of this particular area of your life.
[time=2968] I will have charge here.
[time=2969] I will be the one who is in control of how you spend your time.
[time=2973] But no, not on your life.
[time=2975] I'm going to spend the time the way I want to spend my time.
[time=2978] And so, however, you build a facade and you make it look as if you use your time differently than you do.
[time=2985] You're even trying to deceive your closest friends that you use your time differently because you refuse to give it up as the Lord would have you give it up.
[time=2994] Maybe it's something in the sexual arena.
[time=2997] Maybe there are some activities going on in your life that are clearly unbiblical.
[time=3001] They are totally outside of the boundaries of biblical morality.
[time=3007] But you're going to stay in control.
[time=3009] You're going to stay in charge.
[time=3011] You're not giving up that thing to Jesus so help you Jesus.
[time=3015] And so you just deceive everybody in your world because you will stay in charge.
[time=3023] Maybe it's alcohol.
[time=3026] Maybe it's some type of drugs.
[time=3029] Maybe it's prescription drugs.
[time=3034] Who are you deceiving?
[time=3036] Just find that area in your life.
[time=3038] Just identify the point where you're deceiving people.
[time=3041] And I'll bet you right behind that.
[time=3043] There's a power and control issue between you and the Lord.
[time=3047] And he's saying, "I'd like to be king." And you're saying, "No, not now.
[time=3051] I'm Herod.
[time=3052] I'll take charge of this." Third question.
[time=3058] What area of your life are you willing to hurt people to keep yourself safe?
[time=3069] I've found that when people get close to sensitive areas in my life that I don't want to relinquish, that I don't want to give up, that I don't want to have anybody meddling in, when they get a little close there, it's very easy to just push them off by hurting them.
[time=3083] It's a very common human behavior.
[time=3085] Oh, you don't round them up and kill them like Herod did.
[time=3088] You give them the cold shoulder.
[time=3090] You walk away in silence.
[time=3092] You put some distance in that relationship.
[time=3094] Well, I don't know what happened.
[time=3095] We used to be getting pretty close.
[time=3097] I don't know.
[time=3098] Two months ago, all of a sudden, the thing just started to go distant.
[time=3101] And I don't know what I did.
[time=3104] And it hurts and I'm, "What?" No, no.
[time=3108] You get out of my life.
[time=3109] You're getting too close to the pressure points.
[time=3112] Maybe you talk behind their back.
[time=3114] Maybe you explode in anger at them.
[time=3116] As soon as they bring that subject up and you just let them know in no uncertain terms that is off limits and we're not talking about it.
[time=3123] You don't say those words, but your anger says it.
[time=3126] And you punish them with the way you treat them for the next week.
[time=3130] And you scold them with your behavior and you let them know no more trying to trespass
[time=3136] into my private area.
[time=3137] That's my area.
[time=3138] I'm in control of that.
[time=3140] You have no business being here and Christ doesn't either.
[time=3145] That ringing any bells?
[time=3147] You do that to people.
[time=3149] Whatever.
[time=3150] Maybe you're the quiet type.
[time=3152] Maybe you're the voiding type.
[time=3153] Are you destructive?
[time=3155] The damaged people?
[time=3158] Because you're going to make sure you maintain power and control over that particular area of your life.
[time=3162] I promise you.
[time=3163] You find that area out.
[time=3164] You look at that long enough.
[time=3165] You're going to find that there.
[time=3166] The Lord's knocking.
[time=3167] The Lord's saying submit.
[time=3170] The Lord's wanting to liberate you, free you.
[time=3175] Empower you to live differently.
[time=3178] Well as we wrap it up, look at verse 11.
[time=3182] There are only only two ways to respond to the Lord.
[time=3186] You submit and worship Him or you rebel against Him.
[time=3189] Verse 11, here's the worshipers.
[time=3192] They came into the house and saw the child with Mary, his mother.
[time=3196] They fell down and worshiped Him.
[time=3198] Opening their treasures, they presented to Him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.
[time=3206] Now I'd like to think that these are God-fearing Gentiles.
[time=3209] I'd like to think that these Magi are God-fearing men who really have been nurtured in the prophecies of Daniel and the Jewish traditions that have been handed down and who have found this the greatest worship experience of their life because they've now set aside all other gods that will meet these Magi in heaven.
[time=3224] I don't know that for sure.
[time=3225] I don't want to make more out of this worship thing than it is.
[time=3228] Maybe it was just the customary behavior to an ancient deity.
[time=3234] But I think that we can understand for ourselves from this text that maybe the way the Lord
[time=3242] would be worshiped by us this Christmas season would be for us to give Him three gifts.
[time=3248] And maybe it's not gold and frankincense and myrrh.
[time=3251] But as they relate to the three points of this message, maybe the first gift we could give is service.
[time=3256] And I mean to the people we've been using.
[time=3259] I mean if you search around there and you find that you've been manipulative, then you're really not caring about a particular person or group of people in your life.
[time=3266] You're just using them.
[time=3267] You're just trying to minimize their conflict in your life.
[time=3269] Or you're just trying to get out of that thing as unscathed as possible.
[time=3273] Maybe the gift that you could bow down and give to Christ this season would be His kingship
[time=3279] in that area of your life as evidenced by your willingness to truly serve Him.
[time=3285] I think He'd be pretty excited about it.
[time=3287] I think it would mean to Him as much as the gold.
[time=3290] Maybe more.
[time=3293] Maybe a second gift, not frankincense, but maybe truth.
[time=3297] Maybe just honest truth.
[time=3299] You know the people you're deceiving in your life, you know the stuff you're hiding back because you want to stay in control of it?
[time=3305] Those very people are probably the people who need to know.
[time=3309] And maybe you can give a gift to the living Lord Jesus Christ this Christmas by telling those people the truth and coming clean.
[time=3317] Honoring the Lord's sovereignty and His rulership in your life by being honest with the people who love and care about you.
[time=3323] A trusted friend.
[time=3326] A brother or a sister in Christ that really loves you.
[time=3329] The third gift, not mer.
[time=3333] But maybe build some people up.
[time=3335] The ones you've been tearing down.
[time=3337] The ones you've been pushing out.
[time=3339] The ones you've been keeping at an arm distance.
[time=3341] The ones you've been exploding at.
[time=3342] The ones you've been exceptionally cool towards.
[time=3345] I'll tell you what, you want to give the gift that Christ receives this season.
[time=3349] Build them up.
[time=3351] Do something to build them up and encourage them.
[time=3355] It's one of the greatest gifts.
[time=3358] I kind of noticed that I wasn't liking the way I was hearing myself talk around the house the last couple of weeks.
[time=3365] Little edgy, little stern, too many.
[time=3367] How come you didn't do this and how come that wasn't done and go do this and you better do that, too much of that kind of stuff.
[time=3372] Kids, they need that, they need to know that there's a standard and that there's consequences when they don't perform and that's just part of growing up.
[time=3378] But you know what else they need, they need encouragement.
[time=3380] A lot of it.
[time=3381] And I just wasn't hearing enough of it out of my lips.
[time=3384] So I made this little pack with the Lord.
[time=3386] I said, you know, every day I'm just going to find one or two things per child and just say that to them.
[time=3392] Somehow, some way, maybe when they're in bed, maybe when I'm dropping them at school, maybe when I'm here, maybe when I'm there.
[time=3397] I whisper to them in there as I go off to work.
[time=3399] I don't know how it happens, it just happens.
[time=3402] It's wonderful what happens.
[time=3404] They just respond.
[time=3406] People get built up so easily.
[time=3408] You know that?
[time=3409] You can have a positive thing in somebody's life so easily.
[time=3412] Find something meaningful in their life and tell them to love them for it.
[time=3415] Appreciate it for them.
[time=3417] My smiles are warmer now and I go home.
[time=3419] The hugs are a little better.
[time=3421] Who do you want to do that, too?
[time=3430] Well, it's wonderful insight from God's word into the life of a man by the name of Herod.
[time=3438] And maybe you found that it gave great insight into your own life.
[time=3441] But as you look into your heart, you know that you need a new king, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3446] If you'd like to give your life to Christ right now, let me lead you in this prayer.
[time=3451] Heavenly Father, I know that I have tried to be the king of my life and that I have sinned against you and there are relationships in people who have been hurt because of the way I have chosen to live my life.
[time=3463] I'm thankful that there's the person of Jesus Christ who can be my king and also the one who would forgive me for these sins and give me eternal life.
[time=3471] I accept Christ as my Lord and Savior today, asking Him into my heart.
[time=3476] I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3479] Well, if you just prayed to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, you'd love to hear about it. Write us and let us know here at the Bible Hour.
