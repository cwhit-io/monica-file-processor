[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=7] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=11] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=13] Pastor Moore's message today is entitled "Nobody Understands Me Like Jesus." But before he brings us this dynamic message, we have a special musical group from Russia called The Good News Singers.
[time=25] Let's join our service as they minister to us in song.
[time=29] [MUSIC - 102 seconds]
[time=155] [APPLAUSE - 10 seconds]
[time=173] [speaking in foreign language] Please be unto you, brothers in Christ.
[time=177] [speaking in foreign language] We have brought with us the most precious greetings from the believers in Russia.
[time=189] [speaking in foreign language] The holiday of Christmas has become a worldwide holiday.
[time=199] [speaking in foreign language] And with a special happiness, Russia is this year celebrating Christmas.
[time=208] [speaking in foreign language] Because in Russia now, many people have understood that Christ loves them.
[time=217] [speaking in foreign language] Many have received forgiveness for sins.
[time=222] [speaking in foreign language] Many have understood that Christ cares for them.
[time=228] [speaking in foreign language] And he is the absolute most best friend in the world.
[time=234] [speaking in foreign language] We will now sing for you a song that we have translated into English.

[time=482] (audience applauds)
[time=503] - (speaking in foreign language) - We're now seeing as a song written by an American author.
[time=512] (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - And the song raises the question of the big question of why does God love us?
[time=525] (speaking in foreign language)
[time=532] - And today we are celebrating and we're so happy that God, he cared so much for us that he sent his only begotten son to this earth.
[time=541] (speaking in foreign language) - And today our hearts are rejoicing and we praise him for his love for us.

[time=733] (speaking in foreign language) - Many times in a Russian village, women gather.

[time=1380] - Hi, my name's Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=1383] Thanks so much for watching us today.
[time=1386] I know a lot of you have been praying for us as we have moved towards our living Christmas tree and again this year by God's grace.
[time=1393] It's just been a tremendous thing and we're enjoying it.
[time=1396] We're ministering to a packed house and just really rejoicing in the things which God has given us
[time=1402] and the joy of Christmas and the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1405] Thanks for praying for us and thanks for even encouraging us as I'll run into a number of you.
[time=1409] Whether I'm in the market or at the gas station and you stop me and say how much you've enjoyed it.
[time=1413] Thank you for your partnership with us.
[time=1416] Just to alert you to a couple of things that are coming up here in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1420] I want you to feel welcome to any of these as you have opportunity.
[time=1423] The first is Christmas Eve.
[time=1425] We'll have a wonderful candlelit communion service at six o'clock in our worship center.
[time=1430] You don't need to be a member of our church to participate in that.
[time=1433] Just love the Lord and we'll include you in our communion service and you can share that with us.
[time=1438] Then the next day of course the 25th is on a Sunday.
[time=1441] It's Christmas and we're going to have a special service really in about 45 minutes to an hour long designed for the kids to encourage them and it'll be a wonderful time of celebrating the birth of Christ and you're welcome to come and be a part of that as well.
[time=1456] Then on January 1 we'll have a special service for New Year's resolutions.
[time=1460] God bless you and I trust you're having a great Christmas.

[time=2046] He emptied himself, taking the form of a bond servant and being made in the likeness of men.
[time=2054] No illusion here, folks, of identification. He traded places. And you and I know that if we accept Christ as our Lord and Savior, it is, in fact, that is what it is. I mean, we become joint heirs with Christ. We get everything he has. But in order to have that, he had to take everything we were.
[time=2078] Probably one of the most desperate cries of any human heart is captured in this little sentence. No one understands me. And if you've worked with people, if you're a counselor, if you're a pastor, if you have the kind of heart that gets you involved with people who are not doing well, you know when they start saying that over and over and over again. No one understands me.
[time=2102] The emphasis goes on no one. No one knows what I'm going through.
[time=2106] No one really knows what I'm feeling. Nobody knows how this set of circumstances is impacting me.
[time=2114] Nobody really knows how empty I feel inside.
[time=2118] Nobody really knows how alone I am.
[time=2122] Well, your antennas go up. That's a very desperate condition. The reality of Christmas allows us then to take the worst sentence in the world.
[time=2134] No one understands me. And by adding two simple little words, change it into the greatest sentence of all history. It goes like this.
[time=2142] No one understands me like Jesus. There it is.
[time=2150] Nobody understands me like Jesus.
[time=2154] That's what the incarnation does. That's what Christmas is all about.
[time=2158] That's what Christmas is all about. So I've assembled seven of the world's most painful, lonely desperate emotions. And I want to review them with you this morning. And I want to remind you that nobody understands you like Jesus. The first, and you're going to need to kind of move with me if you want to see these verses because we don't have a lot of time.
[time=2182] And I'm going to fly to and fro. And you're welcome to come where I'll just read them to you. The first is in John chapter 1 verse 11. The first one is right there.
[time=2190] John 1-11. It says this. He came to his own and those who were his own did not what? Receive him. There's negative painful emotion number one. It's called rejection. And if you have ever been rejected, if you have ever had people look at you and your best effort and then turn around and walk away, you know that this emotion ranks up there with some of the worst.
[time=2218] It's a painful thing. It's a lonely thing. And that's exactly what Christ went through. Christ gave it his best shot.
[time=2226] He lived here in front of us, in front of them. He loved them.
[time=2230] He did his miracles in front of them. He preached his heart out in front of them.
[time=2234] He gave them kindness. He gave them his graciousness. He showed them compassion. I mean images just flood your mind there maybe of the woman caught in adultery and they wanted to stone her and he sends them away into the chagrin of their own sin and then says to her, go your way.
[time=2250] I forgive you. I mean he just did it all. He could do everything we could have asked him to do. He even fed them physically.
[time=2258] And all of it when it was all said and done and when he'd done his very best and given his entire life and heart and soul out there they in one unanimous voice in Pilate's court cried crucify him.
[time=2270] Kill him. Send him away. We want nothing to do with him. Probably the strongest form of rejection anyone could ever endure.
[time=2282] We don't just want him out of our lives. We want him dead.
[time=2286] I don't know who's rejecting you these days.
[time=2290] And I don't know exactly how it feels. I have some ideas.
[time=2294] But I promise you nobody understands you like Jesus does.
[time=2302] The second emotion is over in the book of Matthew, Matthew chapter 20. In fact Matthew 20.
[time=2310] There's a little scenario going on here.
[time=2314] Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee James and John came to him with her sons bowing down and making a request of him. In verse 21 of Matthew 20 he said to her, what do you wish? She said to him command that in your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on your right and one on your left. But Jesus answered and said you do not know what you are asking for. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink? They said to him we are able they eventually proved good on that promise but they at this point had absolutely no understanding of what Jesus was all about and that's what this particular thing is about. It's misunderstanding.
[time=2358] To be completely misunderstood. Not just by the general population but by people who are in your inner circle like these men were and like this woman was. He had devoted his life to James and John.
[time=2370] He had walked with them and talked with them and given them the benefit of hours of personal counsel. I mean they were right up there in the inner circle of his life and this late in his ministry they still completely misunderstand who he is and what his mission is about. They were hoping for still political liberation. They were thinking and somehow believing that this miraculous power of Jesus Christ in the next little while would be turned on Rome and Israel would be liberated and Jesus would be king and they want to sit right here and right here. And they figure the way to get that thing done is to get mom to ask him.
[time=2406] And so mom does her best effort and bows down to make the request. And there he is surrounded by who he thinks are his good friends and they are. They are his best friends.
[time=2418] But he is alone. He is isolated by their complete misunderstanding of who he is his core values and what he's all about. I can't even begin to talk about this particular aspect without thinking of many of you wives who are here this morning. Then you're living with this guy, this man, this husband thing that said he would love and protect and cherish and passionately pursue you.
[time=2446] And as time goes on bless his heart he just fails to really understand what this marriage thing is about.
[time=2454] He's thinking it's houses and cars and businesses and providing and being home at a certain time or going to a certain place.
[time=2462] And you've done your best and you've tried. He's in the inner circle.
[time=2466] You've done your sharing thing but it just never connects.
[time=2470] And you're completely misunderstood. The core thing that you've always really wanted was just for him to love you. Just for him to pursue you. He don't care about the car. You don't care about the house.
[time=2482] You want him.
[time=2486] Right over the top. It's not as if wives are the only people who can be must understood but let me tell you nobody understands that emotion as well as the Lord does.
[time=2498] The third is in Matthew 12. You can go back a few pages.
[time=2502] Matthew 12, verse 38 and 39, says in Matthew 12, 38, then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him saying teacher we want to see a sign from you but he answered and said to them an evil and adulterous generation craze for a sign and yet no sign shall be given to it but the sign of Jonah the prophet and he goes on to talk about that. What's going on here? You'd realize that these scribes and Pharisees had seen more signs than they ever deserved. I mean just back a few chapters. Matthew 8 and 9 catalogs a whole bunch of unbelievable miracles that Jesus was just doing one after another. We have no idea how many miracles he did. The book of John tells us they couldn't all be recorded. I mean they were just chucked full of these signs and miracles but they wanted another one.
[time=2554] I don't know why. It must have been incredible. It must have been a remarkable feeling. Think about it. To see this human being or what at least appear to be a human being, Jesus Christ perform a miracle and violate the laws of nature.
[time=2570] What a rush! I mean whoa! Did you see that?
[time=2574] Reminds me the first time I saw Star Wars and that new technology just hit our culture and feeling as if in that theater that big spaceship like I was out in space and it was going over my head. You know you kind of ducked when it came on the screen. It was phenomenal! Wow!
[time=2594] It was on TV the other day. Boring.
[time=2598] It didn't move me at all. I'm like wow what a man. Is that the best? Now they got this thing called morphing. Morfing where it's not like this frame at your face and next frame at somebody else's. I mean they actually
[time=2610] take a guy's face you've seen it and they turn it into a woman's face.
[time=2614] Wow! And now we're waiting for virtual reality and these helmets that we're going to put on and these suits and we're going to like run and feel it and jump through space. I mean it's always the next thing though isn't it?
[time=2626] It's always that's exactly what these guys are saying.
[time=2630] Man we like the rush. We love the rush. Give us the rush of another sign. In reality these signs had nothing to do about primarily producing feelings of exhilaration. They were to prove that Jesus was the Son of God that he could be trusted. That what he said was true which would lead them then to prostrate themselves, confess their sins and say we worship you. And instead they're saying let us use you.
[time=2654] There it is. That's that next emotion. Number three to be used.
[time=2658] To be manipulated. People don't want you for you.
[time=2662] They want you for what you can do for them. Some of you know something about that. Some of you have people in your lives who are simply there because they want your money. They want the goodies that fall off your table.
[time=2674] They want the stuff that comes their way because they're and you know it and you feel used. You wonder do I have any friends?
[time=2682] Some of you know what it means to have an unusual talent or ability and your boss isn't really committed to you. He's committed to what you can do for him and you know that your life expectancy and your privileged place is as long as your talent is able to sustain itself in this particular work environment.
[time=2702] You're being used. Some of you know that all that is really being pursued when pursuit comes is your physical body.
[time=2710] That's what it's really all about. You don't sense them coming after you. You sense them wanting what they can get from your...
[time=2718] Others of you have a certain energy or a charisma in your personality and people latch onto you and want to take and want to be energized and want to receive from you.
[time=2726] Nobody understands that better than the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2734] There's a fourth one here in Matthew 23. Come on over to Matthew 23 for a minute.
[time=2742] Verse 37. This one I don't think I ever saw as clearly as I did this week.
[time=2746] Remember this one?
[time=2750] Matthew 23.37. Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the Lord is speaking.
[time=2754] Who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together. The way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings and you were unwilling.
[time=2766] This is an amazing thought. Jesus knows what it means to walk down the path of failure.
[time=2774] You say failure? God? Fail?
[time=2778] I didn't say he sinned, no he was sinless and he didn't fail in the sense that he always did the will of the Father. But let me tell you what plan A was according to the book of Matthew when Jesus Christ came he preached his message and did his miracles in the real hope that Israel would repent.
[time=2794] That he could start the kingdom with those very people, the nation of Israel who are alive at that particular time and they like their ancestors continued to rebel against the message of repentance and as a result he failed in plan A which was for Israel to repent. It didn't happen. Plan A didn't occur.
[time=2814] Now of course plan B was exactly what happened and I don't understand in the sovereignty of God how plan A goes with plan B but it does.
[time=2822] God has never caught by surprise but I want you to know something. The original design of life of our Lord was for him to come to offer the kingdom and hopefully Israel would have responded and you'd have a completely different set of gospels. It didn't occur. His mission did not occur in plan A. Faithful and successful though in plan B. Some of you know what that's like.
[time=2846] Some of you know what it's like to have your life effort kind of vaporizing in front of you. To have goals that you really care about.
[time=2854] Not going to happen.
[time=2858] Dreams that you've had. Just dreams.
[time=2862] Leave them right there. You set your hopes on things and now as it shapes up you're realizing that those things are not going to occur. Nobody understands that better or more completely than Christ.
[time=2878] Matthew 27. There's a fifth of you.
[time=2886] Matthew 27.
[time=2890] Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole Roman cohort around him and they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and after weaving a crown of thorns they put it on his head and a read in his right hand and they kneeled down before him and mocked him saying hail Jews and they spat on him and took the read and began to beat him on the head and after they had mocked him they took his robe off and put his garments on him and led him away to crucify him. This number five is all about physical pain. Physical pain. It started there with that crown of thorns. They then beat him on the head with it which drove those into his scalp. He began to bleed. They then stripped them of his clothes after beating him in the face and they scourged him.
[time=2942] They literally filleted the flesh off his back with a whip that had little rocks in it. And in that condition then they laid the cross upon his shoulders and allowed him to carry it all the way to his own point of what is known in history as a form and a style of the most inhumane gruesome gruelling crucifixion or a way of killing someone that's ever been known.
[time=2966] Jesus knows about physical pain.
[time=2970] Nobody in fact understands your physical pain like the Lord does.
[time=2978] There's another one over here in John 21. Go to the end of the book, John 21. This one is akin to being rejected but it has its own little nuance, its own flavor because the Lord here demonstrates the incredible struggle and pain of restoring people who don't deserve to be restored. John 21.15, this is after the events of the crucifixion and then the resurrection so when they had finished breakfast Jesus said to Simon, "Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my lands." Peter was closer to the Lord than even James and John.
[time=3022] I mean Peter was the disciple of the Lord. He was that unique kindred spirit relationship where they were closer than anybody else was close and Peter had made some pretty outlandish commitments to the Lord. He said, "I will never deny you.
[time=3038] Others may I won't and when all this stuff starts happening you can count on me." And then it all started happening and Peter denied his Lord.
[time=3050] And then the Lord moves back into his life makes him breakfast, seeks him out, sits him down and gives him a place back in his life that he did not deserve. He restored an unworthy person back into relationship with himself.
[time=3070] And some of you know that.
[time=3074] Some of you know what that's like. Some of you know how hard that is. Some of you know how it is to let somebody back in your life who doesn't deserve it.
[time=3082] Somebody who's betrayed you. Somebody who's lied to you. Somebody who has done things they said they wouldn't do.
[time=3090] Nobody knows that like the Lord does. The last one here and I saved the best for last. Matthew 27.
[time=3102] Matthew 27.
[time=3106] Verse 45 says, "Now from the sixth hour darkness fell upon all the land until the ninth hour." And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice saying, "Ili, Ili, llama, savakthini." Which means my God, my God. Why hast thou forsaken me?
[time=3130] You know what this last one is? This is the worst feeling in the entire world. It is the feeling of your own sinfulness and your guilt.
[time=3138] This is the feeling of sin and guilt and mark my words though Jesus never once committed a personal sin. He in his death took on all of our sins. And he knew what all of our sins felt like and all the attendant guilt and shame that came with it. It says in the Bible that he who knew no sin became sin on our behalf. That we might become the righteousness of God. Do you understand?
[time=3166] He was pushed out of the presence of God.
[time=3170] That's what it's saying, my God, my God. Why have you forsaken me? The answer is sin.
[time=3174] You have become sin. You have become guilt.
[time=3178] You have become shame. You have taken on it all and you cannot be in my presence anymore. And so the Lord is cast out of the Father's presence. And a relationship which has existed from eternity past John 1 1 says in face to face perfect fellowship between God the Father and God the Son is shattered in that instant because Christ became your sin and my sin. And some of you have been walking in sin.
[time=3202] And some of you have been adding sin to sin to sin and the guilt is heaping up and the shame and you're feeling the estrangement and you're beginning to believe the lie. That God will not forgive you. That God will not take you back. That God does not understand what it feels like to feel that way and he does.
[time=3222] And he beckons to you to turn to repent, to leave that sinful pattern of life and come back to him.
[time=3234] You know what? Nobody understands me like Jesus does.
[time=3238] That's why it says in Psalm 62 8 just bask in this one for a minute. Psalm 62 8 says this.
[time=3246] Trust in him at all times, O people.
[time=3250] Pour out your heart before him.
[time=3254] God is a refuge for us.
[time=3258] All times it grabs all those emotions we've been talking about. And when you're feeling most distant and estranged and misunderstood by people in your world that is the very time to pick all that stuff up and run into the presence of God because he understands you from his own personal experience.
[time=3278] 1 Peter 5, 7, casting all your anxiety upon him because he cares for you. Not like a politician cares for you or would try to as well intending as some of them are. He cares for you because he is the epitome of identification with you. He has walked down your path and then you have some. You have there a sympathetic high priest.
[time=3306] Let me just wrap this up because nobody understands you like Jesus. It is also true that no one can strengthen you like Jesus.
[time=3314] Right? Nobody can strengthen you like the Lord can.
[time=3318] He knows rejection and he can teach you unconditional love of people who have turned against you.
[time=3326] Because he's walked in misunderstanding he can teach you faithfulness to people who really even at this point in your life don't understand what you're really all about. He can teach you and give you the strength to be faithful to them. Because he has been used and manipulated he can teach you compassion. To look behind their using you. To look behind their manipulation and see the true condition of their heart. Real compassion and you can stay in relationship with them.
[time=3355] You can continue to move towards them. Because he has walked in the path of failure he can teach you endurance. Endurance all the way to the cross. All the way staying with the program until they finally take your life. Because he knows physical pain he can teach you to suffer and that by the way is a dignified word in the Bible. Suffering as a dignity to it when it's done through the power of Christ and he can give you that dignity. Because he knows relational disappointment he can teach you how to restore people back into your life who don't deserve to be back in.
[time=3395] And obviously and most wonderfully because he knows what it means to be sin. Because he knows the power and the pain and the weight of guilt he can rush in with forgiveness.
[time=3407] Merry Christmas.
[time=3411] What a God. What a baby Jesus.
[time=3415] I mean thanks Lord for not making a low pass.
[time=3419] Thanks Lord for not just kind of showing up and giving the appearance and the illusion of identification. Thanks Lord for walking in my steps. Let's pray.
[time=3431] There's a wonderful all him the church has been singing for years and years
[time=3439] entitled what a friend we have in Jesus.
[time=3443] And I hope from the message today you understand just what an incredible friend we really do have.
[time=3447] If you'd like to make that personal and ask him to be your savior bow your head and let me lead you in this little prayer in which you can ask Christ into your life.
[time=3455] Father I know that I'm a sinner and that I deserve death and separation from you but I really do believe in Jesus Christ as my savior today I ask him to come into my heart I want him to save me from my sins and I want to walk with him the rest of my life thank you for saving me in Christ today in Jesus name Amen.
