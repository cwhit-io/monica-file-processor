[time=0] Do we acknowledge Christ as the ultimate gift that's going to be given this Christmas?
[time=7] Do we sing a Christmas carol?
[time=8] Do we come to church?
[time=9] I mean, how do we get Him in the middle?
[time=12] How do we come through this thing and really sense that we've communed with the living Christ?
[time=22] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=26] We're so glad you've joined us today.
[time=28] Have you ever gone away from the holiday season frustrated that it never seems to live up
[time=34] to its reputation?
[time=35] It's billed as the time for joy, happiness, and good times of family warmth and friendship.
[time=41] Instead, it's often filled with more stress, anger, and tension than any other time of
[time=47] the year.
[time=48] We'll stay with us today as Pastor Moore talks about Christmas, the mixed bag.
[time=53] But right now, let's join our service as the King's Kids children's choir shares some Christmas music.
[time=87] [MUSIC - 145 seconds]
[time=242] [APPLAUSE]
[time=251] Our service will continue in just a moment.
[time=253] You know each year thousands of people enjoy our living Christmas tree, and now you can enjoy the sounds of our 1994 performance titled, "And Jesus is His Name with the Living
[time=264] Christmas Tree Audio Cassette." We're making this cassette available for a suggested gift to the Bible hour of $8 or more.
[time=272] So write to us today to get your copy and enjoy this beautiful music that celebrates the birth of our Savior.
[time=278] So stay tuned.
[time=279] I'll give you our address right after Pastor Moore's message.
[time=282] [MUSIC]
[time=283] Glory to God, glory in the highest, glory to God, and peace to all men.
[time=352] Peace on earth, peace on earth, peace to men.
[time=358] Peace on earth, glory to God, glory in the highest, glory to God, and peace to all men.
[time=385] Peace on earth, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God, glory to God,
[time=718] a number of you there who knowing our financial need, knowing that our year end project isn't moving as well as it normally would, would like to respond with a gift of 10 or 15 or
[time=729] 20 or $100.
[time=730] It would make a tremendous difference.
[time=733] I just want you to know that I receive no salary from the Bible hour.
[time=736] In fact, 95% of the people who put the Bible hour on do it as I do on a volunteer basis.
[time=742] And the monies that you would send us will go directly into airtime and equipment needs, those kinds of things.
[time=749] So if you have it in your heart this holiday season to help us finish strong and in the black as the Bible hour ministry has throughout its many year history, we'd count that a great privilege and thank you for it.
[time=760] There is one need in particular that we're trying to resolve, and that is we're trying to raise enough money, about $9,000 to add a brand new tape machine to our equipment here.
[time=770] And by upgrading that tape machine, the quality of our picture will be much higher each Sunday
[time=776] morning.
[time=777] It will be as milky, so to speak, it will be a much clearer picture.
[time=781] And there may even be one or two of you who would like to make a significant donation of $5,000 or $10,000 to help us with that.
[time=788] That would be greatly appreciated and go directly to the purchase of a new machine.
[time=793] Well, we've had a great year with you.
[time=795] We're thankful that we can minister together side by side in the city of Fort Wayne.
[time=798] God is doing great things in our city and the lives of the unsaved as we try to reach them for His glory.
[time=805] I trust you'll keep up the great work through your local church and through ministering in the neighborhood and the workplace that God has given you for His glory.
[time=813] We're going to be having a New Year's Day service this year again.
[time=817] It'll be at 1045, just one service that morning here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=822] And if you don't have a church or if your church isn't having a service on that particular day, we want to welcome you to be a part of what God is doing here.
[time=830] As you join us, even physically, coming on the campus and enjoying the fellowship and the praise of our great God with the people of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=838] Again, I wish you a Merry Christmas.
[time=840] Thank you for your love and your prayers and your support and may God bless you.
[time=860] May the angel know out in the stable before there was no place to go.
[time=870] To the shepherds and the wise men, he's no stranger, he's a king.
[time=877] And as they kneel before him, they slowly begin to see.
[time=886] Joy to the world, the Lord is come.
[time=892] Heart the heavenly, angels sing, silent night, all holy night.
[time=904] This is the song the wise men sing, snow is for thee.
[time=912] And I hear the sound of the cracking in the fireplace, while the embers burn in half.
[time=922] Stockings are hanging on the mantel tins along the Christmas tree.
[time=928] And out upon the front porch, you can hear the carolers sing, singing joy to the world.
[time=939] The Lord is come.
[time=944] Heart the herald, angels sing, silent night, all holy night.
[time=955] This is the song the carolers sing.
[time=969] Joy to the world, the Lord is come.
[time=982] Heart the herald, angels sing, silent night, all holy night.
[time=994] This is the song the carolers sing.
[time=999] Joy to the world, the Lord is come.
[time=1006] Heart the herald, angels sing, silent night, all holy night.
[time=1017] This is the song the carolers sing.
[time=1032] Let's pray together.
[time=1054] Thank you for Christ and thank you for the assurance that we have in our hearts today.
[time=1079] It is real.
[time=1080] It is alive.
[time=1081] It does make a difference in our lives.
[time=1083] And it can make a difference in others' lives.
[time=1086] We pray that you would aid us this morning as we continue to worship you and pray these things in Christ's name, amen.
[time=1095] I've entitled my message this morning, Christmas, the mixed bag.
[time=1101] And I mean by that, the question why is Christmas such a mixed bag for so many of us?
[time=1109] Not them, but us.
[time=1111] This is supposed to be this time of unparalleled joy and happiness and connectedness with people
[time=1118] where we just feel so warm by our relationship with family and friends.
[time=1124] And yet it can be the opposite of all that, it can be a time really of great restlessness
[time=1130] in our hearts, it can be a time of anger, a time of strife, anxiety, depression.
[time=1136] Father, we are so thankful that we don't lose morning to worship.
[time=1140] Inside the church, we notice that a plastic Jesus is a time when drug and alcohol abuse
[time=1146] kind of skyrockets and goes through the roof, a time when crime rates are up, a time when suicides are uncharacteristically high.
[time=1155] And a lot of us who are here this morning as believers would admit to an increased level
[time=1162] of tension and restlessness and anger, kind of the inverse of what Christmas is supposed to be all about.
[time=1170] And I want to take a stab this morning at addressing that in my own life and in your life, I don't pretend to have all the answers to why, but I think it's more than the financial tensions
[time=1181] that accompany holiday season for many of us.
[time=1185] And I think it's more than the rush of the season, the fact that we've got a lot of parties to go to and a lot of presents to buy and the roads are choked and the restaurants are choked, I think that's probably part of it, but I don't think that's the root of it.
[time=1199] I think it's more than family, family we don't always see, family we don't always get along with, I think that's part of it, but I really think there's more going on inside of us as human beings.
[time=1211] Those might be superficial things, and as I say, I want to try to take a stab at looking inside this morning and try to understand some of the dynamics.
[time=1222] I think that what happens at Christmas is that there are a number of unmet longings in our
[time=1228] lives that throughout most of the year sit on the back burner.
[time=1236] We get going, you know, in work and we get going in activities and we get going in just the run of life and we're able to take through that those unmet longings and keep them back
[time=1247] here somewhere on a back burner.
[time=1251] But the holiday season has a way almost involuntarily of lifting those desires and longings off
[time=1258] the back burners and putting them on the front burners and then turning the heat up and they're demanding for attention.
[time=1264] They're calling out to be addressed and to be met.
[time=1270] I believe that through the holiday season our expectations to have some of those longings met also consciously goes up.
[time=1277] I mean, this is the time, right, when we're supposed to have those Norman Rockwell experiences and be satisfied by them and walk away from them feeling kind of overflowing with what
[time=1289] it's all about.
[time=1291] However, because those longings tend to go unmet through most of the year anyway, they
[time=1297] are highlighted in being unmet at this particular time of the year and the response, the visible
[time=1304] response, the noticeable response is anger and conflict.
[time=1308] We find ourselves tolerating the season, waiting for it to get over, wishing it would hurry
[time=1314] up and be over.
[time=1315] I heard someone say this week that they wish Christmas hadn't come and though they couldn't articulate the inside stuff, there was a strong sense of, "Man, I just wish I didn't have
[time=1326] to go through this.
[time=1327] Wish I could just, in fact they did say this, wish I could just go back to the normal run of my life." And without looking at these and understanding some of these dynamics that go on inside of us, which I think a lot of us don't understand or forget about ourselves, then there can come a whole level of confusion, just general confusion around Christmas.
[time=1349] I mean, how do we have a good Christmas?
[time=1351] What is it made up of?
[time=1353] A lot of us are going to strive for a good Christmas this year because we've made an extra effort in some categories.
[time=1359] Friends, for example, we're going to try to really steep those up and beef those up and hang on to those and get those to run smoothly.
[time=1367] Some of us are going to work extra hard at giving gifts, more appropriate gifts, or a few extra gifts and what that's all about.
[time=1374] Others of us are going to try to have a good Christmas by simply escaping too much exposure to family and friends that come with the holiday, that we may not appreciate or like.
[time=1386] Others of us are going to find Christmas where the family has left and the children are out of the home and many of us are going to try to find ways to get enough time with them.
[time=1396] And we're going to say it was a good Christmas if the kids came home and spent enough time at home and did the right things when they got home.
[time=1404] A lot of confusing, conflicting, sometimes unattainable goals are going to be set out of the confusion.
[time=1411] For those of us who are Christians, we're going to want to put Christ at the center of Christmas.
[time=1416] We've always wanted to do that, but there's always been a question as how do you do that.
[time=1420] What does that really mean to put Christ in the middle of Christmas?
[time=1424] Does that mean that we're going to pray before we open our presence?
[time=1428] Does that mean that maybe we're going to stop for a while and share some significant things that Christ has done in our lives in the last 12 months since the previous Christmas?
[time=1437] Does that mean we're going to acknowledge Christ as the ultimate Christmas gift?
[time=1441] Are we going to sing a Christmas carol?
[time=1442] Are we going to come to church?
[time=1444] Obviously, those are good ideas.
[time=1447] Some of them are going to help.
[time=1448] Some of them are going to fall flat.
[time=1451] What does it mean?
[time=1452] What is this about?
[time=1453] How can we look at this and have some direction in the holiday season?
[time=1457] Well, let me try to do three things this morning.
[time=1460] And I don't, again, pretend to have the answers, but these are things that are running through my mind.
[time=1464] And I want to do these with you this morning, three things.
[time=1466] Number one, I want to see if we can identify what these longings are.
[time=1470] Put names on them.
[time=1471] Get a handle on them, think about them for a minute, identify them.
[time=1476] What are these longings that get moved from the back burner to the front burner?
[time=1481] Then I want to look at those longings in light of Scripture.
[time=1485] What does the Bible tell us about them?
[time=1488] Where do they come from?
[time=1489] What does God think about them?
[time=1491] What is He doing about them?
[time=1493] And then thirdly, what, if anything, can we do about that?
[time=1497] What can be done about them?
[time=1498] How can we be more proactive in this whole process?
[time=1501] Okay, so those three things.
[time=1504] The first is to identify the longings.
[time=1505] And I'm going to suggest that you probably have an innate understanding of what these are.
[time=1511] And I'm hoping that as I describe them, you'll connect with them and say, "Yeah, I get it.
[time=1516] That's true of me." And for that, you like me may need to retreat back into childhood for just a little bit to some of those early memories of Christmas and what it was about.
[time=1526] And I think a lot of it ties into what we call family.
[time=1530] The biblical concept of family, it comes across in the secular world as home.
[time=1536] You know, I'll be home for Christmas.
[time=1538] And all that that conjures up.
[time=1540] What is supposed to happen to us internally when we come home for Christmas and everybody else comes home for Christmas?
[time=1546] Let me give you four, four longings, if you will.
[time=1550] See if you connect.
[time=1551] The first one is a sense of belonging, a sense that I fit in, a sense that I belong here,
[time=1559] I have a place here, I know where mom and dad are in this process, I know where grandma and grandpa are in this process, and thinking back to childhood, I know where I am in this process.
[time=1568] And I belong in this home.
[time=1571] This is where I fit in life.
[time=1576] If you had that as a child, you were blessed.
[time=1579] But even in that, you may have found as you've grown up, that has a tendency to get a little messed up by the world.
[time=1585] As you face your adult life, you find that sense of belonging can be missing, greatly
[time=1592] depreciated, for a number of different reasons.
[time=1595] For many of us loved ones have moved away, or we have moved away from them.
[time=1601] And the tree is there, and the lights are on it, and the presents are underneath it, and even their presents are underneath it, but they're not there.
[time=1609] And there's a sense that something's missing here, there's a sense of belonging that isn't coming through.
[time=1616] For some, the people that we want there aren't there because they've died.
[time=1622] The Lord has taken them from us.
[time=1624] It's not just that they're in another state, they're not here anymore.
[time=1628] And there's nothing that we're going to be able to do to get them back.
[time=1632] And without them, something is just flat out missing.
[time=1636] And for some, it's a big piece of the equation.
[time=1640] Some of you have lost spouses, some of you have lost parents, some of you have lost children, and there's a sense of belonging here that's being messed up.
[time=1653] For some, it's been divorced, and the family is broken.
[time=1658] And try as you might, you are not able to put the pieces of that puzzle back together to get that situation where it ought to be.
[time=1667] Now, this Christmas, as with all these longings, some of us will be way over here on the high
[time=1673] readings of belonging.
[time=1675] You can hardly wait, praise God, enjoy every last second of it.
[time=1679] It does happen from time to time, and milk it for all it's worth, enjoy it.
[time=1683] But just be aware of the fact that others of us are somewhere else on this continuum, and some of us are becoming convinced that a real sense of belonging is almost become
[time=1696] a myth.
[time=1697] And there's going to be a lot of emptiness in some hearts this holiday season.
[time=1705] The second longing, security, a sense of security.
[time=1712] Not only do I belong, not only do I know where I fit, and probably because of that, I have a sense that here I am safe, here I am protected from outside forces.
[time=1722] Here inside this home, inside this family, I have a sense of security which means I'm not going to be rejected.
[time=1730] I'm not going to be thrown out.
[time=1733] I don't have to earn approval in this particular group of people.
[time=1736] I don't have to perform to stay in it.
[time=1738] There is an unconditional sense that I am safe here and that I am okay here and that
[time=1745] I will never be rejected here.
[time=1747] Now, for many of us, you go back to your childhood to get some of those feelings.
[time=1751] I hope at least.
[time=1753] But as you've approached your adult life, forces beyond your control have wrenched that out of your life, diminished it greatly, and you now have a mere modicum of that.
[time=1765] You are now mom and dad and you are the ones who are supposed to provide this level of security.
[time=1771] And you know what's not in your bank account and you know how tenuous things are.
[time=1777] And you're doing your best to shield your kids from that, but you know very good and well, the home does not feel as safe to you as it did in the past.
[time=1786] Some of you have had your homes intruded on by sickness and disease.
[time=1790] They've invaded the walls of your home and it's just not as secure as it used to be.
[time=1797] The security of your youth has been ripped out of your hands by the real realities of a world that doesn't always promote that.
[time=1806] The third longing that came to my mind is one that I'll call contribution or a sense of
[time=1812] being able to contribute.
[time=1814] It's this feeling of not only am I belonging here and not only am I safe here, but it's good that I'm here because I make a difference to this group of people.
[time=1822] They like the fact that I'm here.
[time=1825] I bring something to this table.
[time=1827] I bring something to this equation and it's enjoyed and appreciated by those I bring it to and therefore I feel enjoyed.
[time=1836] My jokes matter, you know, my gifts are appreciated.
[time=1844] My personality is enjoyed by those who are in this particular group of people.
[time=1850] And as a result, I have a sense of making a worthwhile contribution that is enjoyed by those who are around me.
[time=1859] That's how it is supposed to be.
[time=1861] For many this holiday season, they will feel avoided.
[time=1866] Oh, they'll be there.
[time=1867] They'll be in that home.
[time=1869] They may have arrived and no sooner do they come, maybe even through the way the invitation was made, there's a sense of, you know, I'm being tolerated.
[time=1879] I'm here because I'm supposed to be here.
[time=1881] I'm not here because I'm wanted and looked for and enjoyed.
[time=1889] It's going to be a sense of just merely being tolerated.
[time=1896] A fourth longing that I think is bound up in our hearts that we may have really sensed
[time=1902] in our childhood is a sense of hope, a sense of hope, a sense of optimism.
[time=1910] If you've had the privilege of coming from a strong home, you've known it as a child that things have gone so well in all your memory, you know, all three or four years since you turned five years old and you can remember something and there's a sense that it's only going to get better.
[time=1924] Opportunities are going to open up and new situations will come which provide a greater
[time=1930] sense of optimism for the future.
[time=1934] For many as you've grown up, that sense of hope and optimism has really been displaced.
[time=1941] And you're saying kind of quietly in your mind, you know, based upon my past, if you're asked me to make certain estimates of my future, there's no optimism there.
[time=1952] I mean if you knew my situation and what I've gone through since I've become an adult or even since I was a child, you talk about a strong family, I didn't know it, why would I have a sense that the future is going to get better?
[time=1966] And hope is robbed.
[time=1967] And what ought to be there in that home, what ought to be there in that family has a profound sense of genuine hope and optimism based upon the strength of the past that the future will be wonderful gone.
[time=1980] Many of you are thinking that way about Christmas.
[time=1982] You're kind of given up on Christmas.
[time=1985] You're kind of saying, you know, based on the previous Christmases, there is no basis whatsoever.
[time=1991] No basis whatsoever for me to anticipate a good Christmas this year.
[time=1998] And connect with those four basic intrinsic longings that I think God has put in our heart that
[time=2004] surface big time in the holidays, belonging, security, sense of contributing and a sense
[time=2011] of hope.
[time=2012] Well, what does the Bible say about these?
[time=2015] What does the Bible say about the family?
[time=2017] Now to be honest, you know, I couldn't sit over there in my study this week and open the concordance and find the word family and then come down a category and say holiday and then come down a category and say longings.
[time=2029] There just isn't a passage in the Scripture that we could just go to and exegete and there it would all fall out for us, what the family and the home are supposed to be about in the holiday season.
[time=2038] But nevertheless, I think the Bible says a lot about the issue and a lot about these four longings and I find it very interesting that these are the very things, these four
[time=2049] issues that God seeks to restore to us in salvation.
[time=2055] In the fall, we gave those away.
[time=2058] Adam and Eve had them all in complete total sense every moment of their life.
[time=2063] And with the fall, we all lost them to one degree or another and it is at salvation that
[time=2070] God enters back into our lives and begins to give us and I say begins because that's
[time=2076] what I mean and I think you'll understand this as we go.
[time=2079] He provides for us the spiritual resources where we can begin to again sense a measure
[time=2085] of these longings being fulfilled in our lives.
[time=2088] Let's look at them in God's Word.
[time=2092] First of all, let's look at this notion of belonging and come with me to Ephesians chapter one and you'll find there that God is listing off the spiritual blessings which come to us
[time=2101] when we come to Christ.
[time=2106] And there are about eight or nine of them listed.
[time=2107] We're just going to look at the first one and it just nails this belonging thing right
[time=2113] on the head.
[time=2115] In chapter one of Ephesians, look at verse three, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with every blessing in the spiritual places in Christ." Verse four, "Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and blameless." It says in verse five, "In love, He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ
[time=2137] to Himself." Now you recognize and I recognize that when we were born into this world, we are children of Satan, John chapter eight.
[time=2146] We are alienated from God.
[time=2148] We are outside the family.
[time=2149] We are in hostile relationship to God.
[time=2152] And in salvation, He gives us belonging.
[time=2155] He adopts us into His family and says, "Now you belong to Me." What I find so intriguing about this passage is that He doesn't do it as an afterthought.
[time=2164] He did it as a forethought.
[time=2165] It says, "Before the foundation of the world, God chose us in Him.
[time=2171] He knew our name from eternity past.
[time=2174] He knew all about us and He sovereignly chose us."
[time=2180] I should say it this way.
[time=2181] He chose you and He chose you by name and He didn't choose you for some secondary place.
[time=2189] He chose you so He could adopt you as His own son or His own daughter immediately into
[time=2196] His family.
[time=2197] And a lot of us know what a powerful thing that is.
[time=2202] A lot of us have experienced that at different points in our life this overwhelming sense of, "I am a child of God and things are right and things are at peace and He's smiling on me." This wonderful living Christmas tree has lifted up the baby Jesus.
[time=2219] Her name is actually Mariah.
[time=2221] If you've been, you know there's a baby and it's not really a boy.
[time=2224] Now don't tell anybody that because you know we could get in trouble.
[time=2227] Actually it's a girl named Mariah.
[time=2230] And if you've seen it, you know these three kings begin to celebrate the baby and they begin to rejoice in the baby.
[time=2237] And finally they all end up in this triad here with the baby and they're all holding in their arms and they kneel at the very end of this crescendoing anthem to the glory of Christ and they lift the baby above their heads.
[time=2250] And it just drives you nuts.
[time=2254] It is so powerful.
[time=2257] But in the first week we found that the baby began to cry when it would come onto the stage at a different point and it almost was a distraction from the point.
[time=2267] And we've altered some things in the process to try not to miss this exalting moment at the end.
[time=2272] There are a number of things.
[time=2273] We did was we replaced the original actress playing the part of Mary who did a wonderful job.
[time=2279] And see I've been sitting right here in the front row and so I see these facial expressions and I can watch this stuff happen.
[time=2285] We replaced the actress with the actual mother and the difference is astounding.
[time=2293] The actress looks like she cares and did a good job at looking like she cared but the mother cares and it's obvious.
[time=2301] I mean it is just all over her face from the minute that baby comes on then it goes into this person's arms and then this person's arms and then she is just like voom voom voom.
[time=2315] You know you get it right?
[time=2316] It's called belonging and that is exactly how God is with you.
[time=2322] There is no acting.
[time=2324] There is no substituting here.
[time=2326] There is no distance in his room.
[time=2328] He is just locked onto you and he has you.
[time=2331] You are his child.
[time=2334] Now see that's what he wants to give us in salvation.
[time=2337] That's what he in fact has given us in salvation.
[time=2340] Well what about this sense of security?
[time=2344] Come with me to Romans chapter 8.
[time=2348] Romans chapter 8 and these are familiar verses but please don't miss the power in them because you can hear them already in your mind as I'm turning to them.
[time=2361] This is the big deal you know and this is the crescendo of scripture all about eternal security.
[time=2367] Look at verse 31.
[time=2368] What shall we say then to these things if God is for us who is against us and the answer is it doesn't matter who you stack up.
[time=2375] They're just not big enough to overwhelm God.
[time=2379] You come into verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ and then he doesn't just say nothing.
[time=2385] He just lists every possible conceivable thing that could separate a human being from the love of Christ.
[time=2390] Tribulation, distress, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, verse 38 I'm convinced
[time=2397] that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present or things common or powers nor height nor death nor any other created thing shall ever be able to separate you from the love of God which is in Christ.
[time=2408] Now if that's not a sense of security folks I don't know what is.
[time=2411] I mean he can't say it any stronger.
[time=2413] He can't get any plainer.
[time=2415] He is saying you are mine you belong to me and nothing will ever change that reality.
[time=2422] You come up with anything you want to come up with.
[time=2424] A sampling is listed here and it's just not big enough it's just not strong enough it's just not able to separate you from the love of Christ.
[time=2434] That's security, that's unconditional, irreversible, irresistible or irresistible love just never
[time=2442] goes away.
[time=2445] Given to us at salvation now there's third longing my favorite verse in the whole Bible
[time=2452] Ephesians 2.
[time=2454] Come there for just a minute and I'll be honest with you I doubt this verse.
[time=2459] I mean in my experience I really do I sometimes think about this verse and almost want to laugh at it because I feel so inept and so unable to do the things I think God wants me to do
[time=2471] but I believe it nevertheless and it'll be a part of my life to try to believe it more.
[time=2477] But if you want to talk about a sense of contribution Ephesians 2.10 for we are his
[time=2483] workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared beforehand that we
[time=2489] should walk in them.
[time=2492] You have the ultimate creator making his ultimate creation, you.
[time=2499] You are his masterpiece, you are his workmanship, why and in relation to what?
[time=2505] Good works.
[time=2507] You are uniquely suited to do good works, well which good works?
[time=2511] Anybody's good works?
[time=2512] No.
[time=2513] The particular ones which he prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=2519] That's amazing.
[time=2520] That is absolutely amazing.
[time=2522] God has suited you as a believer in Christ to accomplish certain good works which he in fact has gone before him before him win before the foundation of the world so that you would have a sense that you matter.
[time=2535] So that you would have a sense that it's good you showed up and did what you did.
[time=2542] You are not tolerated in the kingdom of God.
[time=2547] You are not here because of some formality, you are here by his choosing, you are here forever because of his love and now that you are here he has enabled and made you in such a way that you will make unique and profound contributions to the family of God.
[time=2565] The last one here, let's just go to Colossians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, a couple books to the right.
[time=2571] It's a difficult passage we won't look at the whole thing.
[time=2576] Paul is just doing his theological thing here talking about the mysteries which have been hidden in the past and he's so excited about that because he knows all about Judaism and all about the Old Testament and now finally the fullness of the truth of God has revealed and he comes into verse 27 of Colossians 1 and says to whom God willed to make known that's us.
[time=2596] What is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles and then he says it, he just blurts it out, which is Christ in you the hope of glory.
[time=2605] You want to talk about optimism, you want to talk about a sense that the future is better than the present, that is what it is all about when Christ comes in you it instantly signifies
[time=2616] that the future is a whole lot better than the present.
[time=2621] That was one of his major themes.
[time=2623] He would say to people you know it's a hard life isn't it, and you're in last place here, but cheer up it's going to get better because when you get to heaven you'll be in first place.
[time=2634] He would say to people it's hard isn't it, you've been humbled, it's been a humbling thing, you've been misunderstood and you've played the part of a humble person cheer up it's
[time=2645] going to get better when you get to heaven God will highly exalt you even as he did his
[time=2651] own son.
[time=2653] Jesus would say to people you've given yourself and you've spent yourself and it seems as if no one has appreciated that well cheer up it's going to get better because God himself
[time=2663] will reward you with insight and with love.
[time=2669] He will assess your efforts and he will reward you beyond your wildest dreams.
[time=2674] Jesus would say to people you've been treated unjustly haven't you, people have not done
[time=2680] you rightly, remember James 5 and suffering under the ungodly rich he would say to them
[time=2686] oh be patient it's all uphill from here because when you come to heaven my father will give
[time=2692] you justice, true justice and sometimes he would just do a catch all phrase by saying with my father all things are possible, now folks that's optimism, that's hope, the familiar
[time=2706] verse in Romans 8 that we just left God promises to work everything to good, everything for
[time=2713] good to those who love him and are called according to his purpose.
[time=2718] So what we somehow intuitively think the home ought to be and the family ought to be and what the holiday ought to encompass.
[time=2727] We look at the word of God and we find that maybe it's not so much intuition or maybe it's not chance, maybe God has actually placed those things in us that's what it means to
[time=2736] be created in the image of God and they have been lost in the fall but they are given back to us at least positionally in our salvation, well okay now we got to get down to where
[time=2748] it means something right in the next couple of weeks here, so let me just say this third
[time=2754] thing I want to talk about this morning is what can be done about it, what can be done about it and I just have three things I want to say here as I close and I hope you're still with me here I hope you can grab this because I really think it can make a difference.
[time=2767] The first thing I want to do is say is this, just because these components of belonging
[time=2774] and of security and of contribution and of hope, just because these are given to us spiritually
[time=2780] in the salvation experience, it does not mean that we will get to experience them fully
[time=2786] while we are on this earth and some of us don't understand that.
[time=2792] Some of us have a demandingness inside of ourselves and we're coming into the holiday and we're saying man it better deliver and God better come through and some of us are even trying to wrench the arm of God through obedience or through Bible study or through prayer and we're trying to get it all stacked up so he's obligated to deliver full extent
[time=2812] of belonging and security and contribution and hope and I want to tell you he has made
[time=2818] no such promises in heaven absolutely here on earth between now and then we get little
[time=2824] fleeting glimpses of the stuff and we need to repent, we need to repent of coming to the
[time=2832] holiday determined what we will get from it in those categories.
[time=2840] The second thing I wanted to say is that some of us will experience more of it than others
[time=2850] and that's good as I've already said, enjoy it but a lot of us are going to come into
[time=2856] this holiday and we're going to start to feel that tension rise and we're going to start to feel those feelings of pushing people away, the feelings of anger, maybe the feelings of depression, maybe the feelings of self-pity, maybe the feelings of conflict coming in and I'm just inviting you, I'm just inviting you here in this second thing.
[time=2874] When you see those symptoms appearing in your life, take a step back and track them back
[time=2882] to the tap root, the real longings that you're looking for, those are belongings and security.
[time=2890] Look at those things as little warning lights and little indicators and jump on that trolley car and follow it back and be able to have a conversation with God about what he's already
[time=2900] given you spiritually but what you're not feeling experientially and just kind of be
[time=2909] there with God.
[time=2911] Just talk to him about that, say things like God, this hurts, man I really want to feel like I matter to this group of people.
[time=2918] I really want to feel like what I'm doing is appreciated and it doesn't and that hurts.
[time=2924] You'll be surprised, it's a good conversation to have between you and the Lord.
[time=2933] The third thing I wanted to say was this, I want to invite you to work hard this Christmas season at giving these four gifts away, see that's interesting isn't it?
[time=2946] As much as we can evaluate how other people treat us and wish they would give us these senses and meet those longings in our lives, we can't for sure meet them in other people's lives but we can go after trying can't we?
[time=2958] When you sit down this holiday season for that family game, what's going through your mind?
[time=2965] What often goes through my mind is how can I win, right?
[time=2970] How can I win this game and I'm really missing it aren't I?
[time=2974] And as a result I tend to get a little strong and do this and do that and I can, how about I sit down, how about you and I sit down this holiday season at that family game and ask ourselves some questions, belonging, who is not old enough yet to really belong in this game right here but wants to desperately and if they're not allowed to be included at least
[time=2994] on somebody's lap or have some reduced version of the game, they're going to go off somewhere feeling really empty like you know what I don't belong here.
[time=3007] How about just looking at those people, just looking at the faces around that table and saying how, belonging, what do I have to give to increase their sense that they belong?
[time=3019] How about a sense of security?
[time=3022] How about a sense that there are some people who may be coming to join you this holiday
[time=3028] season and they really want to fit and they want to feel protected and they want to feel
[time=3034] safe inside this environment.
[time=3036] They don't want to have to necessarily perform in some way to really be appreciated.
[time=3043] Man look past all that other stuff and get in there and give what you have to give.
[time=3049] A sense of contribution, there are going to be some jokes cracked around our families you know, going to be efforts of people to kind of get in the game, kind of play the relational thing, I want to contribute here.
[time=3060] Maybe it's not the best joke in the world.
[time=3063] Enjoy it will you and enjoy them for trying.
[time=3065] Give them a sense that you actually enjoy their effort, the heart behind that thing.
[time=3071] Maybe that meal wasn't the best meal that ever got cooked.
[time=3074] Enjoy the effort and enjoy the heart behind it and let them know you enjoyed it.
[time=3077] You get what I'm trying to say?
[time=3081] And give people a sense of hope that we're on the way up, that we're on the way of pulling
[time=3087] this thing together not fragmenting this thing apart.
[time=3090] It may not be everything it was supposed to be this year but we took some strides and it'll be better next time.
[time=3097] Think in terms of giving away, I don't think it's the number of presents, I don't think
[time=3104] it's that we're hanging on traditions though traditions can help with some of this stuff.
[time=3109] And what does it mean to put Christ in the middle of your Christmas?
[time=3112] It might be a prayer, that might help.
[time=3115] It might be a Christmas Carol but I really am coming to believe that to put Christ in the middle of Christmas is to look at people in terms of these longings and start giving myself to them to try my best to meet some of those in their life.
[time=3128] And suddenly I may not have even said his name but he's center stage.
[time=3133] He's center stage because I'm trying to put flesh and blood to the spiritual things that
[time=3139] he has said are ours in salvation.
[time=3142] Well let's pray together.
[time=3148] God help us to go past some of the facade of Christmas, even help us get past the traditions
[time=3158] and maybe revitalize the traditions because they're no longer just traditions.
[time=3162] They're vehicles that we can communicate this kind of stuff to people.
[time=3167] Lord thank you for providing for these needs in our lives ultimately in Christ.
[time=3174] Thank you for being the kind of God that understands us and meets our needs.
[time=3179] Help us to be patient Lord to wait for their fullest fulfillment in heaven and when we get glimpses of them now help us to be especially grateful.
[time=3188] Lord we love you and we praise you in Christ's name, amen.
[time=3194] Let me invite you to stand as we close our service.
[time=3199] You know as I was singing this little chorus that we sang we're going to sing it again in a minute.
[time=3204] Tim's here to help us do that.
[time=3206] The one that's in your bulletin you might take a look at that.
[time=3208] Notice how it says he came to love us, he came to serve us.
[time=3214] Think about the manger for just a minute.
[time=3215] Do you realize that nobody in the manger was home for Christmas?
[time=3222] I mean we see the manger and it causes us to want to go home.
[time=3225] Be with our family and friends, get all wrapped up.
[time=3228] Nobody in the manger was home.
[time=3230] The shepherds weren't home, the wise men weren't home for Christmas.
[time=3238] Mary, Joseph, long way from home they were up there doing that census thing and most
[time=3244] importantly Jesus Christ wasn't home for the first Christmas.
[time=3249] He left all the glory and all the splendor and all the fellowship of his relationship with God the Father and the heavenly host, left home for Christmas.
[time=3257] Nobody in the manger scene was away from home for Christmas.
[time=3261] What's the response?
[time=3262] Look at it right there.
[time=3264] He came to love us, he came to serve us.
[time=3265] What can I give him?
[time=3267] I'll give him my heart.
[time=3269] I will love him and I will serve him.
[time=3272] I will live my life for him and I'll give him my heart.
[time=3275] You know, he said it over and over and over again.
[time=3276] If you want to show how much you love me then love the people around you and as Tim leads us in this last little song maybe it needs to almost just be another prayer on our hearts.
[time=3285] Let's just make some investments.
[time=3286] Let's give the right gifts and watch God honor those efforts.
[time=3315] I will love him and I will serve him I'll give my life for him and I'll give him my heart.
[time=3345] Well, I don't know how it's going for you this Christmas holiday season but I'm just
[time=3352] concerned for those of you who have never prayed to receive Christ and accepted him as your personal Lord and Savior and as we were talking today in the message, there are certain resources which God gives us in salvation, a sense of belonging and security and an opportunity
[time=3368] to contribute and hope for the future and while even those of us who have Christ as our Savior
[time=3374] don't experience those in totality all the time, we at least know that they are ours because God has given them to us through Christ.
[time=3382] You may be watching today and have no sense of belonging, it's shattered, it's destroyed, no sense of security, wondering if you're a value to anyone to make a contribution that
[time=3393] would be received.
[time=3395] You have no hope for the future.
[time=3397] You're brokenhearted today and you'd like to have a fresh start, you'd like to see God begin a new work in your life and set you on a path that's meaningful that takes you in a productive, wholesome direction.
[time=3409] You can have that by accepting Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3414] You do that through a little prayer that God hears as you say it in your heart and if you mean it, God hears it and God answers it and if you're at that place in your life today, I invite you to bow your head right now, I'll bow mine and I'll lead you in this little prayer and what I'm saying out loud, you say in your heart to God.
[time=3434] Heavenly Father, I know that I'm a sinner, I know that I'm lost, I know that my life is in many ways far different than I would have wanted it to be.
[time=3443] I don't sense belonging and security and contribution and hope.
[time=3447] It's despair for me, I'm at the bottom and I ask that Jesus Christ would come into my
[time=3453] heart to be my Savior.
[time=3455] I believe in Him, I put my faith in Christ to be the Savior of my soul and I look forward
[time=3463] to the days in the future that because of Christ, I will have purpose and I will have meaning.
[time=3469] Thank you for saving me today through Jesus Christ.
[time=3471] In His name, amen.
[time=3474] Well, if you prayed that prayer, you're on a brand new path and we'd love to know about your decision.
[time=3480] Write us here at the Bible Hour and let us know about that.
