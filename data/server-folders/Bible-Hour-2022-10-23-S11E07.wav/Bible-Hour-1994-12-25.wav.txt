[time=14] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hog Baptist Church.
[time=19] We're delighted you've joined us.
[time=20] Today we're presenting a special edition of the Bible Hour, so let's join Pastor Russ as he introduces this program.
[time=28] Hi, my name's Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour and thank you for joining us today.
[time=33] Well, as many of you know, we've been asking you to pray faithfully that God would allow us to present the living Christmas tree again this year in an effective manner.
[time=41] And as I reported back to you not too many weeks ago, that's exactly what God has done, and we're so thankful and so excited.
[time=49] It's just been overwhelming to see the way the Lord has blessed in pulling together three, four hundred volunteers to make sure the living Christmas tree
[time=57] was done again to his honor, and we had packed houses each and every night and just had a great time presenting Jesus Christ as personal Lord and Savior
[time=67] the answer to our problems.
[time=69] And we thought today we might share the living Christmas tree with you, and so the Bible Hour today will principally be made up of the living Christmas tree.
[time=77] I think we've been able to offer it to you today almost without edit.
[time=80] There have been a few songs that have been needed to be deleted just so we could fit it in.
[time=84] But we trust you'll enjoy it and rejoice in our great God and Savior as we reflect back on the wonderful things he has done for us in this last Christmas season.
[time=94] God bless you.
[time=114] [MUSIC]
[time=142] We will see you looking like a Christmas card.
[time=146] Lots of lights and lots of decorations.
[time=149] Every house in every part of town is getting ready for a celebration.
[time=157] We will hold town holiday.
[time=162] One another way to celebrate.
[time=165] Hold town holiday, one another time to be home.
[time=171] It's a season to share with the people of care in this game.
[time=176] Hold town holiday.
[time=179] On a home town holiday.
[time=186] [MUSIC]
[time=189] Every window's got a Christmas tree.
[time=193] Shining brighter than the stars above us.
[time=196] Every calendar is full of plans.
[time=200] Taking time to put a one to love us.
[time=204] Hold town holiday.
[time=209] One another way to celebrate.

[time=244] Stay Christmas time is finally dated above.

[time=429] [APPLAUSE]
[time=438] Well thank you and good evening and welcome to the 1994 living Christmas tree.
[time=443] It's hard to believe that 12 months has slipped by us into last concert.
[time=446] But the calendar tells us that once again the Christmas season is upon us.
[time=450] Our family here at Black Hawk is happy that you and your family and friends have chosen to join us for this special occasion.
[time=457] So sit back relax and celebrate the season as we deck the hall and trim the tree.
[time=463] [MUSIC - 219 seconds]

[time=1029] Once long ago, when the world seemed totally lost, stumbling in the dark night of its own sinfulness, God sent a light.
[time=1039] Into the reckless, hopeless, desperate midst of his fallen creation, God sent not a giant, but a helpless infant.
[time=1048] Not an armored warrior, but a baby, vulnerable and small.
[time=1054] Into hearts that could refuse him, and hands that would abuse him, God sent his most fragile and yet his most powerful gift, his love incarnate, his son.
[time=1067] Angels and mortals, peasants and kings gathered that night to gaze at this royal gift to honor his arrival with the anthems of heaven
[time=1077] and the treasures of earth.
[time=1080] How much they understood that night is uncertain, perhaps only the two who stood closest to his crib knew the truth, the truth that someday the whole world must see and believe, that this child was surely much more than a child, for in him was life, and that life was the light of men.
[time=1102] [MUSIC]
[time=1117] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life, hail the birth of the holy one, bring in the season of life.
[time=1144] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life.
[time=1158] Bring in the season of life.
[time=1162] The Christians all rejoice.
[time=1166] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life, hail the birth of the holy one, we begin to what we say.
[time=1180] Bring in the season, bring in the season, go in the season of life.
[time=1193] [MUSIC]
[time=1199] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life, hail the birth of the holy one,
[time=1209] bring in the season of life.
[time=1213] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life.
[time=1232] [MUSIC]
[time=1240] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life.
[time=1254] [MUSIC]
[time=1262] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life.
[time=1294] [MUSIC]
[time=1300] Rise and shine for your light has come, bring in the season of life.
[time=1344] [MUSIC]
[time=1373] Most kings are found in castles, but castles rarely welcome the common man.
[time=1379] When looking for a birthplace for the king, God needed a place where all could come.
[time=1385] The common stable was easily accessible to both rich and poor alike.
[time=1390] A glow seemed to permeate the darkness of the stable, indescribable.
[time=1395] Was it a light, a holy illumination, or was it simply God's love bursting through the darkness of man's sin?
[time=1404] Joseph, with those rough calloused carpenter's hands, gently caress the child while pondering in his mind.
[time=1420] I'm sure he must have been surprised at where the road had taken him.
[time=1432] 'Cause never in a million lies would he have dreamed of Bethlehem.
[time=1445] And standing at the manger he saw with his own eyes.
[time=1453] The message of the angel come to life, and Joseph said, "Why me?"
[time=1464] "I'm just a simple man of trade, why you?"
[time=1471] "You've all the rules in the world, why you?"
[time=1480] "Inside the stable field with hate, why you?"
[time=1487] "She's just an ordinary girl."
[time=1493] "Now I'm not born the second guess, what angels have to say."
[time=1502] "But this is such a strange way to save the world."
[time=1514] "To think of how it could have been, if Jesus had come as he deserved."
[time=1527] "There would have been no Bethlehem, no lowly shepherds at his birth."
[time=1540] "But Joseph knew the reason love had to reach so far."
[time=1548] "And as he held the Savior in his arms, he must have fought, why me?"
[time=1559] "I'm just a simple man of trade, why him?"
[time=1566] "With all the rules in the world, why you?"
[time=1575] "Inside the stable field with hate, why her?"
[time=1582] "She's just an ordinary girl."
[time=1588] "Now I'm not born the second guess, what angels have to say."
[time=1597] "But this is such a strange way to save the world."
[time=1605] "Now I'm not born the second guess, what angels have to say."
[time=1627] "But this is such a strange way to save the world."
[time=1642] "A strange way to save the world."
[time=1654] "To save the world."
[time=1672] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1688] He suffered good will to all men.
[time=1691] Now the angels send the echo.
[time=1694] Let the glatters shout again.
[time=1700] Come and praise the Lord our King.
[time=1705] Hear the message that we breathe.
[time=1712] Christ is born in Bethlehem.
[time=1715] He is son of God and son of man.
[time=1721] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1724] He suffered good will to all men.
[time=1727] The angels send the echo.
[time=1730] Let the glatters shout again.
[time=1736] He was sent to earth from heaven above.
[time=1740] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1742] King of glory, King of love.
[time=1746] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1748] Heaven's throne proclaims this night that this child will rule with power and mind.
[time=1756] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1759] He suffered good will to all men.
[time=1762] Now the angels send the echo.
[time=1765] Let the glatters shout again.
[time=1772] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1786] Worship him on vended knee.
[time=1790] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1793] And join the earth, all heaven and earth as we celebrate Emmanuel's birth.
[time=1801] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1803] He suffered good will to all men.
[time=1806] The angels send the echo.
[time=1809] Let the glatters shout again.
[time=1815] Heaven's throne proclaims this night.
[time=1818] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1819] He suffered good will to all men.
[time=1822] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1825] He suffered good will to all men.
[time=1828] Let the glatters shout again.
[time=1831] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1848] Good will to all men.
[time=1851] He suffered good will to all men.
[time=1862] Glory, glory in the highest.
[time=1925] The shepherds ran the darken path to Bethlehem.
[time=1931] To see the child to meet the king.
[time=1938] Imagining a royal scene would welcome them.
[time=1945] There be songs of praise and worship, gifts and offerings.
[time=1953] A regal hall alive with celebration.
[time=1960] To greet the child to meet the king.
[time=1967] A banquet feast of festive jubilation.
[time=1974] There be music filled with praise and would the angel sing.
[time=1982] This is the way a mighty king is born.
[time=1989] This is the way to welcome royalty.
[time=1996] An earthly celebration for his coronation day.
[time=2003] Trumpets sound a regal fan there.
[time=2008] This is the way.
[time=2018] A modest manger bed is where the shepherds found.
[time=2024] The holy child, the king of kings.
[time=2032] The presents turn the stable into holy ground.
[time=2039] But this was not the royal scene.
[time=2042] They were imagining.
[time=2047] They knelt before God's holy gift.
[time=2051] The Savior's birth.
[time=2054] This was the child.
[time=2057] This was their king.
[time=2061] From heaven's throne, God's only son had come to work.
[time=2068] Let all creation raise the song and with the angel sing.
[time=2077] This is the way a mighty king is born.
[time=2084] This is the way to welcome royalty.
[time=2090] Yes, this is God's way that a mighty king is born.
[time=2097] This is God's way to welcome royalty.
[time=2104] A heavenly celebration for his coronation day.
[time=2111] The angel sound a regal fan there.
[time=2116] This is the way.
[time=2121] The angel sound a regal fan there.
[time=2128] This is God's way.

[time=2676] (audience applauds) - You know, one of the things I'm finding as I grow a little older is that there are things that I've had or known about earlier in life that I didn't really appreciate.
[time=2694] And then as circumstances in my life change, it becomes a whole lot more valuable to me.
[time=2702] It's a little bit like my winter coat.
[time=2705] I received this coat as a gift when my uncle my uncle died about six years ago.
[time=2714] He was actually a fighter pilot in World War II, was an ace and traveled all around the world and I had this wonderful winter coat made in Hong Kong and his name is embroidered in it.
[time=2724] And when I got it, I looked at it and I said, "Man, this is a great coat." And I tried it on and it fit.
[time=2730] And then I thought to myself, "Yeah, I don't really need this." So I put it in a coat bag and hung it up in the closet, never thinking I'd ever wear it.
[time=2740] Because at that time, about six years ago, I lived in Southern California.
[time=2745] Where, you know, a really cold day is like 40 degrees.
[time=2748] People are upset.
[time=2749] It's dropped all the way to 40 degrees.
[time=2753] But then some circumstances in my life changed.
[time=2757] And I moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana to become a part of this church.
[time=2764] Well, just Wednesday here, a few days ago, I finally broke down and got out my winter coat again.
[time=2771] We had a funeral to do that day and I knew we'd be out by the graveside if you remember, it was kind of a cold day.
[time=2777] And I knew that without this coat, I might not even be able to perform my pastoral duties.
[time=2782] I'd be shivering so bad that, you know, I wouldn't be able to really communicate.
[time=2786] And as I was pulling this coat out of that closet, I thought to myself, "Good night." This thing is going to become the most important piece of clothing to be in the next three or four months.
[time=2799] It's going to go everywhere I go.
[time=2800] And in some ways, I'm really dependent and tied to this particular garment.
[time=2805] One that previously, I never really thought I would need or use.
[time=2810] And, you know, I think that for some of us, that's a little bit like Christmas.
[time=2816] I mean, for as long as we can remember, we've been hearing about Christmas.
[time=2820] And we've known about the baby Jesus, and we've known that he was sent by God to be the savior of the world, and that, you know, Christmas is all that that is.
[time=2830] And it's kind of been like this coat.
[time=2832] It's kind of been nice.
[time=2833] And we kind of put it over there on that shelf.
[time=2835] And we thought, "Yeah, I know about it.
[time=2836] It's nice. It's over there." And then suddenly, the circumstances in our lives begin to change a little bit.
[time=2846] And for you, maybe it's been the '90s.
[time=2848] Maybe it's been this last 12 months.
[time=2853] And your world is looking a little different than you thought.
[time=2858] And the harsh, kind of the cold, harsh reality of your life is today much different than it was a few years ago.
[time=2867] And maybe you'd like to reconsider the place that Christ could have in your life.
[time=2876] Maybe some of the circumstances are much different.
[time=2879] For example, maybe you've contracted some type of a disease.
[time=2883] Maybe you've found out that you're very, very sick.
[time=2886] Maybe you have cancer.
[time=2888] And a few years ago, you had no anticipation of that.
[time=2891] You knew it was happening around you, but you didn't expect it would be you.
[time=2894] And now there's kind of a cold, harsh reality of this powerfully destructive disease that's working its way through your body.
[time=2903] And you're wishing there was some way to be protected from that.
[time=2907] Some way to learn how to deal with that.
[time=2910] Maybe it's a relationship.
[time=2913] Maybe there's a person in your life that you really thought you could count on.
[time=2916] A person that you never anticipated would walk away from you.
[time=2921] But in fact now, things are different.
[time=2924] And there's been some betrayal and desertion.
[time=2928] And you're left facing a very harsh, cold reality.
[time=2933] Maybe it's something in your employment.
[time=2936] Maybe you reached some agreements.
[time=2937] Maybe you set a course and things have gone far differently than you thought.
[time=2942] And now it's cold.
[time=2944] And it's harsh.
[time=2946] It's really interesting.
[time=2947] The Bible talks about a person when they come to faith in Jesus Christ,
[time=2953] when they put their faith in Him and accept Him as their Savior and invite Him into their life to be their Lord and Savior.
[time=2959] It says that we are then clothed with Christ.
[time=2963] It's as if that, you know, we're kind of putting on the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2968] That's exactly how the Bible talks about it.
[time=2971] Because when you accept Christ as your Lord and Savior, He gives you a certain protection, a certain warmth.
[time=2981] Well for one, by accepting Christ as your Savior, He protects you from having to stand before the harsh reality of a God who is looking at the sin in your life and is ready to judge you because of your behavior.
[time=2998] I don't think there's anybody in this place that would want to try to stand up and say that they're sinless.
[time=3004] That they've never said a harsh word or had an angry attitude or motive or felt jealousy, just to name a few.
[time=3014] And you know the Bible is very clear that without Christ,
[time=3021] we're going to stand before God on our own.
[time=3025] And He's going to look at that sin and because He's a just and a holy and a righteous God, He's going to hold us accountable for what we've done.
[time=3033] And we're going to be left to a very harsh reality called eternal separation from God that's called hell.
[time=3041] But in Christ, with the forgiveness that comes to us through the person of Jesus Christ, we're protected from that and we're forgiven because He died for us.
[time=3051] Remember He grew up from this little thing and died on a cross.
[time=3055] And it's as if in that act He offers us the coat off of His back and says, "I know it's cold, it's too cold for you, it's too harsh for you.
[time=3062] Let me give you my protection because I've paid the price."
[time=3069] The Lord will also give you the strength to deal with things like cancer and harsh relationships.
[time=3076] Now He never promises to take the cancer away and He never promises to make our world perfect like the relationships all come back together as we would like them to.
[time=3087] But a lot like a coat just because you put your coat on it doesn't mean that it stops being cold.
[time=3091] The point is it allows you to bear up under the coldness.
[time=3094] There's a certain strength, there's a certain warmth that you can have and you can venture through the coldness and reach your objective.
[time=3102] And that's what Christ does, doesn't take the cancer away.
[time=3106] I don't understand that, He could, but He doesn't.
[time=3109] He doesn't put all the relationships back together perfect and put little bows on them.
[time=3115] But He will give you the strength to have purpose and to have meaning
[time=3121] as you walk through some of the hard, cold, harsh realities of life.
[time=3126] But there is this important element, where just like on that Wednesday a few days ago
[time=3135] I had to reach for my coat and I had to put it on even as I have again tonight.
[time=3141] Unless you do that personally with the person of Jesus Christ, you're in the cold.
[time=3147] It really is a personal thing where you put Christ on.
[time=3156] The people that once walked in darkness, they now have seen a great light.
[time=3173] Where there is born in the city of David, a child who will drive out the night.
[time=3185] The government shall be on his shoulders, and his kingdom will never end.
[time=3200] The great I am, the king of all the ages.
[time=3207] But even a child who called in bread, he shall be called.
[time=3215] Wonderful counsel, learn my echos.
[time=3218] Prince of peace, he shall be called everlasting Father, and his kingdom will not see.
[time=3228] He shall be called in man, he will pass with us, king of kings, forever the same.
[time=3235] He shall be called a friend to the family, and Jesus is his name.
[time=3248] All these great words of the prophets, of a wonderful Messiah would be.
[time=3261] Find in this friend I call Jesus, for he's all of these things to me.
[time=3274] He's a counselor, my God, and my Father.
[time=3280] Where I've traveled, he's my prince of peace.
[time=3287] And when I just speak the name of Jesus, I find everything that I need.
[time=3300] And now he is my wonderful counselor, my chief God.
[time=3305] Prince of peace, he shall be called everlasting Father, and his kingdom will not see.
[time=3315] And now he is Emmanuel, not with us, king of kings, forever the same.
[time=3322] He is my friend, forever a friend to the family.
[time=3326] And Jesus is his name.
[time=3335] Jesus, Jesus.
[time=3342] He's my wonderful counselor, the Prince of peace, and the everlasting Father.
[time=3352] He brought hope to me.
[time=3356] Oh, we're in the name of Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[time=3363] Let I know that Jesus is his name.
[time=3368] And now he is my wonderful counselor, Prince of peace, and now he is my everlasting Father.
[time=3379] And his kingdom will not see.
[time=3383] And now he is Emmanuel, not with us, king of kings, forever the same.
[time=3390] He is my friend, forever a friend to Jesus is his name.
[time=3398] Oh, Jesus is his name.
[time=3414] (Applause)
[time=3428] It's wonderful to know that God has made provision for our sins and the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3433] And I guess if you were feeling or thinking or wondering as we were talking about Christ
[time=3439] and through the songs that you have a real need to be covered and protected, I brought you to that place in your life even today.
[time=3446] I want to invite you to accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3449] And I'm going to say a little prayer here.
[time=3451] I'll say it out loud and if you'll say it in your heart to God, he'll hear you and he'll answer your prayer.
[time=3457] Let's pray together.
[time=3459] Father, I know that I am a sinner, that I have violated your law, that I deserve death and hell and separation from you.
[time=3468] I'm thankful that you've made a provision through the person of Jesus Christ that I can be covered and forgiven and pardoned from my sin and given purpose and meaning.
[time=3477] I believe in Jesus Christ as my Savior.
[time=3479] I accept him into my heart to be my Lord, that I can live to the glory and the honor of God.
[time=3485] And I pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3488] Well, that's a tremendous decision.
[time=3490] And if you've prayed this prayer quietly in your own heart, we'd love to know about it and send you some information to help you follow through on your decision to live for Christ.
[time=3499] Let us know about that.
[time=3500] In a moment, I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance.
