[time=302] â™ª
[time=312] Well, thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=314] If you're like me, you're struggling to get back into the normal routine after the holiday season.
[time=318] We had a wonderful time here praising the Lord as we presented the living Christmas tree, and also worshiped God and celebrated His birth in our regular worship services.
[time=329] I hope that you have a great new year and that it all is beginning well for you.
[time=333] You've already heard today on our broadcast, Dan Oxley, as a wonderful ministry through the trumpet of Flegal Horn and a unique instrument called the Electronic Valve Instrument.
[time=343] He's going to be playing for us again, and I hope you'll stay tuned.
[time=346] We just appreciate the ministry of Dan and Donna Oxley.
[time=350] I don't want to tell you that a number of you wrote in at the year end and gave us a financial gift, and we're really thankful for that.
[time=357] Right now, we're just looking over all the income, and we've told you a number of times that we plan to purchase new equipment.
[time=364] We're looking at that, and we're going to tell you in the coming weeks how much equipment we were able to purchase
[time=370] because of your faithful giving, and we really do appreciate that.
[time=373] We hope the quality of the program improves because of this ability to get new equipment,
[time=379] and we're thankful for all of you that give.
[time=382] And I want to just tell you, as we begin the new year, that most of our income for the support of the Bible Hour comes through the Founders Club.
[time=389] You've heard us mention that a number of times, and I just want to remind you that it's our great source of encouragement
[time=395] through prayer and through financial giving, and I like to have you consider being a part of it.
[time=400] If you're a member of the Founders Club, you receive what we call the Life Walk.
[time=405] It's a devotional booklet that comes every other month and has a every day scripture reading and explanation of that scripture.
[time=414] Some of the topics that you'd receive if you got it this week would be discernment, contentment,
[time=421] and a great study as we go into the month of February on 1 Corinthians 13, the Love Chapter.
[time=428] A marvelous study guide.
[time=430] It's not very long. You just have a short passage of scripture, then a little explanation, but it's very well written.
[time=437] The president of the organization from which we get this magazine, Bruce Wilkerson, is an excellent editor.
[time=444] You'll receive great inspiration from this book.
[time=447] So, if you'd like to know how you could become a Founders Club member, and I want to send you a copy of Life Walk
[time=453] if you'll write to us this month, and you can get an idea of the inspiration that this booklet could give you.
[time=459] And I'd like to have you consider becoming a member of the Founders Club this month and support us throughout this year in the Bible Hour.
[time=467] So, let me give you the address that you can write for this booklet and an explanation of the Founders Club Ministry.
[time=473] Just write to the Bible Hour at 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the zip code is 46815.

[time=945] [MUSIC - 554 seconds]
[time=1503] Well, I just don't see that. I don't see that in this verse and I don't see that anywhere else in the New Testament. In fact, we are taught that our rejoicing is in light of circumstances but because of our relationship with the Lord, not because of the circumstances being, you know, a basis upon which we could rejoice. We'll talk more about that in a minute.
[time=1523] A second way that this text has been taught inappropriately is this. That I am so in touch in my relationship with the Lord. My relationship with Jesus is so meaningful and so enthralling and so thrilling and so captivating that really it doesn't matter what my circumstances are because I never even recognize them anyway. They're just subordinate. They're a secondary issue to me.
[time=1547] I am just so focused on the face of Jesus and my relationship with Jesus and my quiet times with Jesus and my praise times with Jesus that all the circumstances in the world couldn't take my joy because I am just focused on Christ.
[time=1561] Well, that, my friends, is nothing more than a form of denial. Jesus said, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free and the Word for truth. All they say, it just means reality. The whole idea behind Christianity is that we can get in touch with reality. Who God really is, who we really are, how sinful we really are, and how fallen this world really is.
[time=1581] Christianity is not a fast ride into the pretend world of fantasy and denial that my relationship with Jesus means my world doesn't matter. In fact, it is the opposite. It is that by knowing Jesus, I can fully embrace the reality of my world.
[time=1597] And if you want another compelling things about Christ and about the Apostle Paul, for example, these were both men who embraced fully the hardship of their life. Jesus didn't walk around here so enamored with his relationship with God that he was unaware of how people were treating him.
[time=1612] Jesus didn't die there on the cross, so enamored with God that he didn't know he was dying. Jesus was fully aware of how people were treating him, how they were insulting him, how they were manipulating him, how they were using him, how they were failing to acknowledge him as deity.
[time=1626] He acknowledged all that stuff. He was 100% in touch with all of it all the time. So this rejoice in the Lord always is not some fast ride to Christian denial that just means circumstances don't matter because Jesus is so wonderful.
[time=1641] He said, "Well, what does it mean? What is a proper understanding of it? Well, we begin to understand it with these words. It is a courageous faith. It is a courageous faith that embraces the real world.
[time=1654] And finds sufficiency in Christ to move with purpose and a dynamic and a sense of meaning that builds true joy in light of circumstances as adverse as they may be."
[time=1669] Let me show you an example of this. Come with me to the book of Habakkuk. That's the Old Testament prophet. If you're moving from the New Testament backwards, it's only a few books into the Old Testament.
[time=1683] Jonah, Mike, and they him Habakkuk or Habakkuk. It's in the crispy portion of the Old Testament. That section we rarely turn to.
[time=1696] We find here the real life drama of what it means to rejoice in the Lord.
[time=1703] Here is a guy who is not going to see the Lord change his circumstances. They're difficult and they're going to stay difficult. In fact, they're going to get worse.
[time=1711] So that's option number one. That's out the window. Secondly, here's a guy who isn't going to just say, "Well, I love Jesus or I love Yahweh so much that my circumstances don't matter."
[time=1720] You'll find he is very much in touch with the circumstances of his life. What you'll find is a man who, through faith, pursues God and finds strength and perspective in the midst of difficult circumstances.
[time=1733] We begin in chapter 1 verse 2. The prophet asks a question, "How long, O Lord, will I call for help? And that will not hear. I cry out to the violence and yet that does not save. Why does thou make me see iniquity and cause me to look on wickedness?"
[time=1748] Yes, destruction and violence are before me. Strife exists and contention arises. Therefore, the law is ignored and justice is never upheld for the wicked surround the righteous. Therefore, justice comes out perverted.
[time=1761] This great prophet, this great man of God, is looking at his own people, the land of Judah, the chosen of God, and he's saying, "These people are wicked, God. Violence and injustice and deceit and treachery and justice is coming out perverted. How long, O Lord, will you allow your people to live in such a sinful condition?"
[time=1780] And you see, he takes this very personally, because he's the preacher, he's the prophet, he's the leader, he's the guy whose job it is to confront these people with their sin, see their repentance and watch them walk in obedience.
[time=1793] But obviously, it's been a long time now that he has been saying these things and calling them and preaching them and no repentance and they go on and on and on. And so, he takes it as a personal failure.
[time=1803] He views his own mission in life as having not been successfully completed because he's the guy that's supposed to call him to obedience, he doesn't, they don't change. He's frustrated, "How long, O Lord, will I call for help?"
[time=1814] Verse 3, "Why does thou make me see iniquity? Why do I have to live with this stuff?"
[time=1820] So, there's his big question. God answers the question. Now, notice, he doesn't answer "How long," and he doesn't answer the question, "Why?"
[time=1828] Which, if you've noticed in your relationship with God, God rarely answers those two questions. When you ask him, "How long?" and you ask him, "Why is this happening to me?"
[time=1836] He rarely tells you, "Oh, well, it'll be for this much longer and here's the exact reason why." But he does answer. Look at verse 6, "For behold, I am raising up the caldians," which is another word for the Babylonians, and this is a reference for the Babylonian captivity.
[time=1851] 605 BC, Nebuchadnezzar comes, wipes everybody out, takes them in a deportation. Who are these caldians? What do they look like?
[time=1858] Verse 8, "Horses are swifter than leopards, they are keener than wolves in the evening. At the end of verse 8, they fly like an eagle swooping down to devour."
[time=1866] Verse 9, "All of them come for violence, their horde of faces moves forward. They collect captives like sand, and rightly, and poetically described as this massive military might of the Babylonians."
[time=1879] And God is saying, "This isn't some little group coming after you. These are the caldians, and they'll swoop down on you and bring destruction like you've never seen it before."
[time=1887] That's answer, number 1. You know, I'm almost sorry I asked at this point.
[time=1892] So you're telling me that wicked Judah and our disobedience were going to be destroyed by the caldians.
[time=1900] Well, that brings the prophet to a hold in another question. Look at verse 13. Actually, we can start in verse 12.
[time=1909] Art thou not from everlasting, which is a way of saying, "Aren't you God? O Lord, my God, my holy one, emphasis on the question.
[time=1920] Well, aren't you holy? Will we not die? Thou, O Lord, has appointed them to judge, and Thou, O rock, has established them to correct. Thine eyes are too pure to approve evil.
[time=1931] And thou can'ts not look on wickedness with favor. Now here it is. Why does Thou look with favor on those who deal treacherously?
[time=1939] Why are thou silent when the wicked swallow up those more righteous than they? You see, his new question is this.
[time=1946] Judah, sure, we're wicked. I told you about that in verses 2, 3, and 4. But if you think we're bad, the caldians are debatched. They're super sinful. They're super wicked.
[time=1960] So he says, "God, how could you be the holy infinite everlasting God whose eyes are too pure to approve evil? How could you bring a more wicked caldian to wipe out your own people?
[time=1972] How can this be?" Well, God answers in one more time. And the answer He gives, Habakkuk is the answer, and the key to our understanding of what it means to rejoice always.
[time=1982] Chapter 2 verse 4. Behold, as for the proud one, his soul is not right within him. Here it is. But the righteous will live by his fate.
[time=1996] The righteous will live by his faith. In other words, Habakkuk, at this point, I'm not going to give you any more answers. I'm not going to entertain your questions any further. It comes down to this. You need to believe and trust in me.
[time=2012] You need in the circumstances of life when things are difficult and you feel a failure, and you're not sure about the future, and all your world is potentially falling apart with the invasion of the caldians. You, my friend, need to trust in me the true and living God.
[time=2025] More specifically, let me give you three things you need to trust in. Or three things about God, you must be willing to trust. Number one, that God is in control.
[time=2035] God is absolutely sovereign. God is absolutely totally sovereign. All the events of human affairs occur under the sovereignty of God. So on 4610, cease striving and know that I am God.
[time=2048] That future contingency that you have out there, you're wondering, will it fall to the right or to the left? Will it be good? Will it be bad?
[time=2055] I'll promise you one thing, God is in control of it. God is absolutely sovereign in whatever future contingency you bring to the text this morning. He is sovereign. He is in charge. Secondly, God will use it for His glory.
[time=2069] God will ultimately bring all of this together for His glory and honor and praise. So you can be confident, and you can be joyful, and you can rest in the notion that God is not just allowing my life to go on, happenstance, without His concern, without His control, and without His involvement.
[time=2088] And secondly, that it will add up to something meaningful, His glory. Real joy can come when you know that God, despite your sinfulness, can use your life to bring glory to His name and to His honor.
[time=2100] And thirdly, God will use it to perfect the saint or the saints. God will use whatever events come into your life to move you more like Christ. Make you look more like Jesus Christ.
[time=2112] Grow you up into maturity. There is the beginning of what it means to rejoice in the Lord. Again, I say rejoice. Come to the end of the book of Habakkuk, and you'll see Him doing this.
[time=2124] Habakkuk, chapter 3, verse 17. You'll notice that God has not changed His circumstances. You'll also notice that God has now not made Him immune or anesthetized to the circumstances. He's very aware of the circumstances.
[time=2140] Habakkuk 3, 17. Though the fig tree should not blossom, and there be no fruit on the vines, though the yield of the olives should fail, and the field produced no food, though the flocks should be cut off from the fold, and there be no cattle in the stalls.
[time=2155] Now folks, in an agrarian community, the day in which He lived, everything was run on the farm. It was all about crops and herds. And what He is saying is, everything that represents my world, the fig tree, the fruit on the vine, the olive on the tree,
[time=2169] the produce in the field, the flock in the field, all of that stuff, cattle in the stalls, if it's all gone, if my whole way of living is gone and wiped out, verse 18, yet I will exalt in the Lord, and I will rejoice in the God of my salvation, the Lord is my strength, and He has made my feet like Heinz's feet and makes me walk on high places.
[time=2193] How can He say that? One, He knows God is in control. He knows the Caldeans cannot touch Judah without the sovereign permission of God Himself.
[time=2203] Secondly, He knows that God will allow that invasion and work that invasion to the glory of God, which of course it did. God took the people of Israel into Babylonian captivity for a number of years, their Daniel rose to prominence.
[time=2217] Numbers of people came to Christ. There are some who think the wise men who came seeking Jesus were influenced by the teaching of Daniel as it worked its way down through that culture, and they came to get saved as a result of Daniel's ministry.
[time=2230] There is the whole book of Daniel and all that we know about the end of the age through his prophecy. Eventually the people were brought back into the land and Christ the Messiah came.
[time=2239] He could be confident that God would work it out for his glory because God always works it out for his glory, and that may be why we have the Old Testament to remind us over and over and over again despite the sinful, willful, rebellious heart of man, God is in control, and God always works things out according to His plan for his glory.
[time=2259] Secondly, He could rejoice, or thirdly, even that in the loss of His entire world as He knew it, He could be confident that God would strengthen His own life and draw Him closer in His relationship with God.
[time=2272] So, rejoicing in the Lord always is the courage and the humility to fully embrace the hardship of life, to fully embrace the hardship of life, to enter into the situation and know and trust and accept that God is in control, He'll work it for His glory, and He'll also perfect them a tour of the same.
[time=2295] Which, by the way, is completely in agreement with James chapter 1, which says that, "Consider it all, joy my brother when you encounter various trials knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. Why in the world can we have joy when we encounter trials? One, we know God is in control, two, He'll work it to His glory, and three, it'll perfect us. It'll bring endurance in our lives."
[time=2318] One of the greatest passages in all the New Testament about being at peace with God is Romans 5, you don't need to turn there. Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through faith, or rather through Jesus Christ.
[time=2333] So, ultimately, we are put at peace with the sovereign of the universe. Therefore, it goes on to say in Romans 5, not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance and perseverance, proven character, and proven character, hope, and hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been shed within our hearts.
[time=2354] There is that ultimate moment of coming to peace with God through the sacrifice of Christ, and then the rest of our life, all the hardship, all the trials, all the difficulties are greeted as friends into our life because they have the power of drawing us into dependence upon Christ and looking more like Him.
[time=2373] That's how come we can rejoice always. That's the only reason we can rejoice always. Without a sovereign God, we couldn't rejoice always because there would be times in our lives where we could question whether or not this was really supposed to happen.
[time=2388] With a sovereign God, every sickness, every financial difficulty, every relational difficulty, every single thing in our lives is under the sovereign view of God, and He works at all together for good to those who love Him and who are called according to His purpose.
[time=2404] Come back now to Philippians 4, and see this wonderful command, rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. It is in reality a very humbling act.
[time=2421] Do you realize that? To be happy in the Lord, you have to be humble. You have to, in your heart, take your hands off the controls of your life and say, God, you are in control. This is all about you and your direction of my life.
[time=2438] I repent of trying to make you do what I want you to do. You lay the path out in my life, and I'll trust that it's within your sovereign control, it's for your glory and it's for my good.
[time=2452] It's a humbling act in which you affirm the goodness of God and submit to His plan. Let me read you a sentence. Listen to this.
[time=2461] Whenever we place a higher priority on solving our problems, then on pursuing God, we are immoral. Whenever we place a higher priority on solving our problems, then on pursuing God, we are immoral.
[time=2481] This life is not about solving our problems. This book is not about solving our problems. Prayer is not about solving our problems. Church is not about solving our problems. All of the above are about pursuing God.
[time=2496] A sovereign loving God who controls our world, and we greet the hardship and we greet the difficulty as wonderful gifts that He gives us whereby we can be reminded that all of this is not about us, it's all about Him, thereby we can see the limitations of our own power, the futility of life without Him and pursue Him with a genuine and real passion.
[time=2519] Here's another sentence. I must surrender. I must surrender my fascination with myself to a more worthy preoccupation with the character and purposes of God. That's good. I must surrender my fascination with myself to a more worthy preoccupation with the character and purposes of God.
[time=2543] I am not the point. He is. I exist for Him. He does not exist for me. You want to know peace? You want to be free of stress? You want to be on the path of knowing the peace of God, it begins right there.
[time=2565] I exist for Him. He does not exist for me. All the circumstances in my life are under His sovereign control for His glory and He will graciously use them to grow me more to the person of Christ.
[time=2580] Therefore I can rejoice in the Lord. No matter what happens, in light of what happens, I can rejoice.
[time=2589] Number two, the second imperative is found in verse 5. It says this, "Let your forebearing spirit be known to all men, the Lord is near." Let be known is the imperative verb.
[time=2606] So we are being commanded to let our forebearing spirit be known, and this is where it gets even harder, another absolute, to all men. To all men, everybody we see, everybody we know, everybody we encounter, everybody in our past, everybody in our future, we are to show a forebearing spirit to them.
[time=2625] That's the word for bearing mean. It's not one we often use. Listen to this definition. A willingness to be taken advantage of. A forebearing spirit is a spirit that is willing to be taken advantage of.
[time=2641] It's an ability to submit to injustice, disgrace, mistreatment, without hatred or revenge.
[time=2649] The forebearing spirit is an ability to submit to other people's sinfulness, manifested in our own injustice, our own disgrace, our own mistreatment, without firing back at them in hatred or revenge.
[time=2666] You say, you got to be nuts. We're supposed to show that kind of spirit to everybody. Well, what does that make us? It's Christian. Does that reduce us to this milk toast Christianity, where we just roll over and play dead, and somebody slaps here, so we let them slap here, and somebody takes the outer garment, so we give them the inner garment?
[time=2687] Are we rightless? Are we without any dignity? Do we just let people stomp all over us through life? It's a good question. The answer is found in Acts chapter 16.
[time=2699] Would you turn there for a minute? I find it intriguing that Acts chapter 16 is all about the Apostle Paul and his first visit to Philippi.
[time=2709] And here we are studying the book of Philippians. In other words, Paul knew that they had seen him live this very attribute out.
[time=2716] They've already seen firsthand his living illustration of a forebearing spirit. It's an absolutely amazing testimony. In Acts chapter 16, Paul gets called through the Macedonian vision, which is special vision by God, to go and take the gospel to Europe for the very first time.
[time=2732] He ends up in Philippi. He arrives there and in verse 14 meets a certain woman by the name of Lydia. From the city of Thia Tyra, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshipper of God, was listening and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul. She gets baptized in the next verse. We're off to a good start.
[time=2749] God, thank you for calling me to Philippi. These circumstances are wonderful.
[time=2755] Verse 16. It happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her master's much profit by fortune telling.
[time=2766] Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out saying, "These men are bonds servants of the most high God who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation." It's amazing, isn't it? That's good theology.
[time=2777] Demons usually do have good theology. Verse 18. And she continued doing this for many days, but Paul was greatly annoyed and turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out at that very moment.
[time=2791] Her words were true. Paul just wasn't sure she wanted her as her press agent. I mean, she wasn't the person to announce his arrival.
[time=2799] So, and I think though we don't see a record of it here or anyone else in the New Testament, this was a great act of compassion. And I believe with all my heart, we will see this slave girl in heaven.
[time=2809] He probably not only cast a demon out of her, but then went on to lead her to the Lord. Or out of gratitude, she probably came to the Lord.
[time=2815] But the focus of the story goes elsewhere. Look at verse 19.
[time=2819] "When her master saw that their hope of prophet was gone, they seized Paul, dragged him into the marketplace before the authorities, and when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said these men are throwing our city into confusion and being Jews, and are proclaiming customs, which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe being Romans."
[time=2839] Watch what happens. Verse 22. "The crowd rose up together with them, the chief magistrates tore their robes off them, and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods, and when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely.
[time=2855] And he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks."
[time=2862] Now circumstances have gone from really great. Thanks for calling me to Philippi, Lydia comes to Christ. I am now held by a mob for something that I did not do, and I am being beaten with rods, and in the hands of a skilled person these rods could filet the skin and the meat of your back and open it, open wounds, open exposure.
[time=2885] Then, from there into the inner stocks, which would have been a very painful torture device, suited to keep the joints from moving. And you know, when you drive for a long time, you want to get out and move, because the bodies secrete certain chemicals or acids, and it requires movement or pain occurs, these stocks prohibited that movement and the pain got more intense with time.
[time=2907] They are, it says in the inner prison, know that a very dark place, a very unclean place, no doubt human excrement was left to lie there, and so the attendant flies and bugs and all the rest would move from that to the open sores and their back. It is anything but a wonderful situation.
[time=2924] Now what does Philippians 4/4 say?
[time=2927] Rejoice in the Lord always, look at it in verse 25. But about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. How in the world can you do that?
[time=2939] You have to have a pretty significant confidence that God is sovereign, that He will indeed use these circumstances for His own glory, and that somehow He will cause you to look more like Christ in the process.
[time=2952] Well that is exactly what happened. A localized earthquake occurred, verse 26, shook everybody, all the doors opened, the chains came off, the jailer was going to kill himself, because he was going to lose all his prisoners, and by Roman law that is what happens, you lose a prisoner, you die.
[time=2967] Paul calls out to him, brings the guy to Christ, he believes in the Lord Jesus Christ, he gets baptized in verse 33 along with his entire household.
[time=2975] Huge marvel is wonderful miracle goes on, boom, earthquake, and this guy comes to Christ with his whole family. Now here is what we are headed, watch, verse 35.
[time=2986] Now when Day came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen saying, "Release those men." The jailer reported those words to Paul saying, "The chief magistrates have sent to release you, now therefore come out and go in peace."
[time=3000] It is not as strong in the English as it is in the Greek, what they are saying is, "Leave town quietly." Why? We don't want any more localized earthquakes.
[time=3008] You are the only prisoner we have ever had who, when we put in prison, unearthquake freed him, and if that is going to be this much, too much trouble you are out of here, go away quietly.
[time=3018] Did He do it?
[time=3020] Oh thank you very much, thank you very much. I'm a milk toast Christian, I have no rights, step all over me, I'll just leave the city.
[time=3029] Is that what He said? Look at verse 37.
[time=3033] But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us in public without trial." Now watch this, men who are Romans, and they have thrown us into prison, and now they are sending us away secretly in the vernacular, not on your life.
[time=3049] No indeed, but let them come themselves and bring us out." He said, "What is this? What's this all about?" Look at verse 12.
[time=3059] "Philipi happens to be a Roman colony. There is a law in the Roman world, and for all who live in a Roman colony that a Roman citizen cannot be thrown in jail and cannot be beaten with rods unless he has had a proper Roman trial."
[time=3077] So when these magistrates hear that they have beaten and thrown this Roman citizen into prison in this Roman colony, they fear for their lives because they could lose them for such an infraction of Roman law.
[time=3090] So how does this relate to forbearance? Watch this. A forbearance spirit is a willingness to be taken advantage of, right?
[time=3097] Do you realize that during the beating up there in verses 22, 23, and 24, and during any time in the imprisonment, all Paul had to say even before the first blow was struck, all Paul had to say was, "I got rights. I'm a Roman, and the whole thing stops."
[time=3116] Forbearance. A willingness to be taken advantage of, a willingness to give up your rights for the cause of Christ. Somehow, and for some reason it doesn't say in the text, but it was probably nothing more than the spirit of God, ministering to Paul as he does to you and me, subjectively, the little voice inside saying, "Paul, don't stand for your rights here. Don't stand for your rights here. Give your rights up. Let them beat you. Let them imprison you."
[time=3140] And so he gives his rights up by not announcing his true identity. What happens? He goes to jail, localized earthquake, the Philippian jailer comes to Christ. Did he know that in advance? I don't think so.
[time=3151] Will you and I know in advance when the spirit of God is prompting us to give up our rights for the glory of that? Maybe not.
[time=3160] So on the one hand, he gives his rights up. That gets him in prison and he gets to lead the Philippian jailer to Christ. Now all that's done, and they want to shoe him out of the city, but he's got a heart for some of the people who came to Christ.
[time=3172] So he says, "Not on your life." Look at verse 40, "They went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia, whom he had just led to the Lord, and when they saw the brethren, they encouraged them and then they departed."
[time=3188] You see? What's the principle? Paul illustrates for us. Yeah, we have rights, and especially Americans, much like the Romans did in that day, and by the way, we are a very small group of people throughout history who have had personal rights.
[time=3201] But the issue in your personal rights isn't your own personal happiness. It isn't to avoid a beating and an imprisonment, and it isn't so you can just go see some friends.
[time=3209] The issue behind your personal rights is how can I either give them up or stand for them as will best advance the cause of Christ? That's the answer. That's what a forebearing experience.
[time=3222] It's a willingness to give your rights up. Give them up if you can further the cause of Christ by giving them up. Stand for your rights if by standing for them. You can further the cause of Christ.
[time=3232] But do you see how antithetical that is with the thought of our day and personal rights? Personal rights are only about personal gratification. You step on me, I step on you. You deny me my rights, you deny me my gratification, I'm angry, I'm incensed, I take you to court, I wipe you out.
[time=3249] No peace there, folks. I'll promise you. I'll promise you. You live your life standing for your own rights, so you can be gratified, so you can be honored, so you can be dignified.
[time=3260] So you can get what you think you deserve and you will have no peace.
[time=3267] Peace of God comes when we learn to rejoice in a sovereign God who orchestrates all the circumstances of life for his glory and our benefit.
[time=3276] So we can embrace those circumstances, treat them as friends, welcome them in and endure through them by the power of Christ.
[time=3282] And secondly, the peace of God comes when we view ourselves as no longer the main issue in life. The glory of God is the issue and my rights are either stood for or I acquiesce to the wishes of another based upon which I think will bring most glory to God.
[time=3295] Those are the first two steps in knowing the peace of God. When we come back next time, there are four more. Let's pray together.
[time=3309] Father, we thank you for the word of God, for its truth that rings so true and it stands in such distinction to a second or mindset that has these things so twisted around.
[time=3323] A second or mindset that believes happiness can only be found in wealth and materialism and physical pleasures and circumstantial blessing.
[time=3332] And we know that joy, real, true joy comes in trusting through a courageous faith, a true and sovereign God who orchestrates our lives.
[time=3342] In a culture that stands in demands, it's rights to the place that they almost bludgeon themselves with their own demands.
[time=3350] And they're not even sure whose rights are most important anymore and everybody's stepping on top of everybody else and nobody wants to acquiesce and nobody wants to give and nobody wants to be gracious and nobody wants to be compassionate.
[time=3361] And of all people, Lord, that should be us. There should be a sweet reasonable that guards our reasonableness, that guards our life, that causes us to interact with people in ways that they understand that we're not in the relationship for us, we're in the relationship for the glory of God and for the other person to benefit.
[time=3381] Help us to be people of a forbearing spirit.
[time=3384] But we thank you for the refreshing instruction from your word and call us, Lord, to obedience. Give us the power and the strength to glorify your name.
[time=3392] We pray these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3409] Oh, we really appreciated the musical ministry of Dan and Donna Oxley from Nashville, Tennessee. I hope they were inspiration to your hearts.
[time=3417] The message today was from our pastor teacher Russell Moore and was on the book of Philippi NC will continue in that series, so I hope you'll stay tuned with us.
[time=3427] If you listen today and you have the need for Christ to come into your heart today, I'd like to take a moment before we close and pray this prayer with you. Let's bow together in prayer.
[time=3437] Dear Heavenly Father, I thank you that I can come to you today and tell you that I've sinned against you and I ask for your forgiveness.
[time=3444] I ask you to come into my heart and be my Savior today. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
