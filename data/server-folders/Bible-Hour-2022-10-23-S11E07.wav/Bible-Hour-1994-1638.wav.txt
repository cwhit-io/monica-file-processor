[time=0] And we try to convince him it was a reason, but he'd always bring us around to giving us his definition of an excuse, and this is what it was.
[time=8] He'd always say an excuse is a thin skin of reason stuffed with baloney.
[time=24] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship, which we
[time=30] hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=33] Thank you for joining us.
[time=35] Speaking today as youth pastor Tim Tetter, his message today is entitled, "The Thin Skins of Reason." Our special music today will be provided by Kevin Rowe and Michelle Smecken's.
[time=54] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=67] Holy is He, and great is His glory.
[time=87] Holy is He, and worthy of our praise, I stand in His presence on praise, and come in
[time=104] Him and praise, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He.
[time=130] Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He,
[time=177] Holy is He, and worthy of our praise, I stand in His presence on praise, and come in
[time=199] Him and praise, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He,
[time=252] Holy is He, and worthy of our praise, I stand in His presence on praise, and come in
[time=277] Him and praise, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He, Holy is He,
[time=306] Lord come, Almighty, All life would shall praise thy name in earth and sky and sea.
[time=322] Holy, Holy, Holy, Mercyful and mighty,
[time=332] All in free mercy, Blessed Trinity.
[time=346] Holy is King, Amen, Amen.
[time=376] [MUSIC]
[time=397] Anybody in the right mind would have given up the preaching, headed for home.
[time=406] They've been warned a hundred times, ruled at something inside them,
[time=413] kept giving them hope, just when you think they'd be crying.
[time=419] Instead of the tears, there's joy in their eyes.
[time=424] What kind of joy is this, counting the blessing to suffer?
[time=433] And what kind of joy is this, that gives the prisoner your soul?
[time=443] What kind of joy could stare down in the face, hear that sweet victory?
[time=452] This is the joy of the soul, that's no good and free.
[time=460] [MUSIC]
[time=466] Anybody else with his name would want to shake a fist at heaven, give up the fight,
[time=475] because trouble had been Paul's little name.
[time=480] Ever since he'd been captured by God's blind and blind, just when his hope should be dying.
[time=488] Listen and hear him sing in a song.
[time=494] What kind of joy is this, that counts it a blessing to suffer?
[time=503] And what kind of joy is this, that gives the prisoner your soul?
[time=512] What kind of joy could stare down in the face, hear that sweet victory?
[time=521] This is the joy of the soul, that's no good and free.
[time=528] [MUSIC]
[time=540] What kind of joy is this, that gives the prisoner your soul?
[time=551] What kind of joy is this, father has promised his children?
[time=562] What kind of joy is this, that Jesus has come to reveal?
[time=571] What kind of joy could give hope in this world, to someone just like you and me?
[time=580] This is the joy of the soul that's for giving up on this joy for my soul.
[time=588] It's for giving and free.
[time=594] [MUSIC]
[time=607] This is the joy of the soul that's for us.
[time=613] What kind of joy is this, that gives the prisoner your soul?
[time=645] I'm very glad you tuned into the Bible hour today, I know during the month of January we have some viewers that usually attend their own church but are unable to attend because of the cold weather and the snow that accumulates in the state of Indiana.
[time=661] So if you are unable to get to your home church and you've joined us for the Bible hour, we're really happy that you have done that.
[time=668] I got a number of letters this week that told people who have that situation where they can't get to their home church and they wrote in and even asked for prayer requests.
[time=677] Just a few minutes ago at Richard and Marge Mead and I sat and prayed for the special requests.
[time=684] I want to encourage you again to write in and let us know that you're watching.
[time=688] That really helps us and gives us great encouragement and gives us the opportunity to pray for some of the needs that you might have.
[time=696] During the month of December we talked about a year end project to raise some funds for new equipment.
[time=702] That equipment has been delivered to our Bible hour studio and is being put together right now and our engineers are learning how to use it and we will be integrating some of this new equipment into the production of the Bible hour ministry even beginning next week.
[time=718] We're very thankful to all of you that helped us financially and assisting us with the purchase of this new equipment.
[time=725] I want to talk a little bit today about the Founders Club. You've heard us mention it and you see at the close of the service that the Bible hour is made possible basically because of Founders Club members.
[time=737] These are people that give about $15 a month to our ministry on a regular basis and it helps us purchase the airtime necessary to produce the Bible hour.
[time=747] I also want to talk to you about a booklet that the Founders Club receive every other month. It's entitled Life Walk. What a great devotional booklet this is and I'd like to have you consider becoming a member of the Founders Club especially so you could receive the Life Walk magazine.
[time=765] It's a daily devotional and each week has various themes. One of the themes is relationships and it says the key to a great relationship is to be a good friend.
[time=777] Some of the topics on Monday morning will be talking about soft words for a hard world and then on Tuesday try a little kindness and on Wednesday the doorway of humility.
[time=788] Thursday how to inherit the earth and Friday it takes patience to build patience. It doesn't take very long. It only takes about 10 minutes to read through the scripture that is offered to you and then an explanation about the topic for that particular day but it'll be great encouragement for you.
[time=805] So why don't you consider becoming a member of the Founders Club and if you'd like to know more about how to become a Founders Club member and what that means, write and ask us today.
[time=816] I want to give you the address you can just simply write to the Bible hour at 7400 East State Boulevard Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=827] Once again just write and ask how you can become a Founders Club member and you can write to the Bible hour at 7400 East State Fort Wayne Indiana and the zip code is 46815.
[time=841] In just a few minutes we're going to go back to the live portion of our program with some more music from Kevin Row and then our message today is from our youth pastor Tim Tetter.
[time=851] Our pastor Russell Moore is out in Arizona and is at a conference. It's entitled a build conference and it's a conference to help lay leaders become better leaders in our church and we're looking forward to implementing this program in our church family.
[time=869] So we hope that you stay tuned for Tim Tetter's message and it's a privilege again to bring you the Bible hour.
[time=899] So on the door, oh there must be another sunrise another sunset that I'll see God will make this trial of blessing that's the love he has for me.
[time=914] God will make this trial of blessing, that sends me to my knees, blow my tears, blow like a river yet in him there's sweet relief.
[time=927] There's no need to get discouraged, there's no need to talk to me. God will make this trial of blessing and the whole wide world will see.
[time=942] I was not the first one to come into this place. You see every child of God this test he must face that is here that God will mold you or make you what you want to be.
[time=959] God will make this trial of blessing just be patient you will see.
[time=969] Now I'm standing on the mountain, looking back I can see when I was in that lowest valley, your strong hands were leading me.
[time=982] Always good to see the sun shining today sweet victory. God will make this trial of blessing, that's the grace he gives to me.
[time=995] God will make this trial of blessing, that sends me to my knees, blow my tears, blow like a river yet in him there's sweet relief.
[time=1008] There's no need to get discouraged, there's no need to talk to me. God will make this trial of blessing and the whole wide world will see.
[time=1024] God will make this trial of blessing, that sends me to my knees, blow my tears, blow like a river yet in him there's sweet relief.
[time=1038] There's no need to get discouraged, there's no need to talk to me. God will make this trial of blessing and the whole wide world will see.
[time=1065] What's good to have you here today, we've been experiencing a week of rather frigid weather and our pastor has been wise enough to be attending a conference down in Arizona this week where he's been enjoying a golf along with classes he's been attending and so forth.
[time=1084] He returns this afternoon, I'd love to be at the airport as he steps off the full plane at Fort Wayne International. They don't give you those little covered tubes to walk into, you just step out in the turbulence of the airport and he's going to know the contrast so but we'll be happy to have him back this evening.
[time=1104] Those of you that know me know that I don't do basketball. Very few people in the last 12 years of my life have ever seen me pick up a basketball much less dribble or try to shoot the thing but it may be of some note to realize that I once did play when I was in junior high I was on my basketball team.
[time=1124] I never once scored a point but I played during the season kind of on and off and my coach coach Wilson was one who enjoyed sports and was really gave it all he had to try to teach us the rules of the game and teach us how to enjoy playing the game and to do it properly.
[time=1142] He was a stickler following his directions and doing what he said to do and when practice started you were supposed to be there on occasion I or someone else would show up a little bit late or we do some other minor thing you know against his instruction and he'd always call us on it and if I'd show up late for practice he'd ask why weren't you here on time.
[time=1164] Of course I always had a reason and it might have been anything from well I had a knot in my tennis shoe whatever I could think of at the moment but there's always some reason I could give and he would always ask a player when we'd give one of these reasons he said he would ask now is that a reason or is that an excuse and we try to convince him it was a reason but he'd always bring us around to giving us his definition of an excuse and this is what it was.
[time=1186] He'd always say an excuse is a thin skin of reason stuffed with baloney and he'd make us repeat it so we got to learn that phrase quite well during the seasons of practice yes a thin skin of reasons stuffed with baloney and then he'd give me about ten laps to run I never never lettered in basketball but I think I did receive a letter in running laps because I got to be very good at that.
[time=1205] The thin skin of reason stuffed with baloney when I began to understand what he was saying and excuse there's truth in that when we try to pass the blame we try to cover up our misdeed our wrongdoing by having a show of an ear of something that kind of makes a little sense but when you look past that you see that it is nothing more than worthless excuse.
[time=1233] All of us learn to give excuse no one has to teach us to get out of trouble we want to pass the responsibility on we don't want to be the one to be blamed for something as children you might have a parent who insisted that you be at supper at the supper table when it was ready to be eaten and if you were like me again you'd find reasons to be away when it was supper time and show up late and your mom or dad might ask why are you late.
[time=1262] And of course we can always think of reasons there's always good reason to be late it might be that my friend Rick's tire was flat and I had to help him get it fixed or we were headed down the road mom and you know that Johnny that kid that beat me up last week that bully that you told me to stay away from he was right in the middle of the road so we had to go we had to go the long way around to get home today or maybe you try to pass the responsibility on to them by saying something to the extent you know that watch you gave me for Christmas.
[time=1289] It's not really working that well I thought I was getting here on time but I just happened to be a little late.
[time=1295] We learn to give excuses I work with students and have had opportunity even last couple years to teach a high school class and it's interesting the reasons that students give are not turning their homework in.
[time=1308] Now some of them are very you know common reasons and anywhere from you know the dog ate it which is probably the most I don't know said that often we hear that excuse talked about but you know I left it on my dresser at home well I thought it was due tomorrow or I didn't understand what you really wanted or my dad spilled coffee all over it or my mom accidentally threw it away or here's a good one if you teach in a Christian school well you know my family had to go to church and I just didn't have time to do my homework.
[time=1337] They think somehow that's going to impress you. Here are some some of the more creative memorable excuses that have actually been given by students as reported by teachers one student said well my aunt Gretchen took it back to Germany with her.
[time=1350] I didn't write it down because well I did it all in my head one student said my sister got mad at me flushed it down the toilet I like this one well you know we had a fire at our house last night when I tried to run back in to save my homework the fireman stopped me.
[time=1365] Now I'm sure that's you know that's the one thing on a student's mind is their room and all their positions are burning up oh my homework I've got to say that.
[time=1374] Here this one I'm sure has a ring of truth to it well my dad made me play Nintendo last night I just couldn't get to my homework.
[time=1384] We make excuses to God no one really has to teach us how to do that we don't want to be blamed for our sins for our misdeeds and so when God confronts us in an area of weakness in an area of wrong we want to explain that away.
[time=1401] But I want to tell you something God's not impressed with my excuses God's not expressed impressed with your excuses in fact as we look as we will look at some of the people in scripture who made excuses to God we find that God actually abhors hates the excuses that they made.
[time=1417] Now this morning I just want us to realize that I believe our lives can be lived more pleasing to God if we'll avoid some of these common excuses some of these thin skins of reason that we tend to give.
[time=1434] When we are caught in our disobedience let me just mention I don't know how many will get through this morning but let let me just talk about some of the more common excuses that we give to God when we're caught in disobedience the first I'll call the past the buck excuse.
[time=1450] That's when we point the finger that's when we try to find a scapegoat that's when we attempt to blame anyone or anything else for our misdeeds.
[time=1460] Author Donald Carroll tells the story of his six year old son coming to him one day and giving him the following information he said a dad there's milk on the kitchen floor.
[time=1471] Well there is is there the father reply and why is that well it accidentally spilled all I see is that said it spilled.
[time=1484] Now you don't suppose any chance that you were there with the milk when it had this accident and the son replied in a tone of weary exasperation well of course that's how I know it spilled I just thought you should know and his son walked out of the room.
[time=1498] It really wasn't my fault it had an accident I happen to be there and I thought you should know. Now you've probably heard some of these before every time I hear them though they raises a chuckle inside of me probably because I know how far I go to try to give reason sometimes for the things I do that are wrong but this is the list of some of the reasons people have actually turned in written excuses that people have given to insurance companies to explain their accidents.
[time=1527] One person wrote well my accident was due to the road bending. It passed the buck it wasn't my fault the road bent and it caused me to have an accident.
[time=1537] Now the other person said well a pedestrian hit me and went under my car well the other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intentions.
[time=1547] Here in all of these it's not my fault it's something or somebody else that caused someone actually wrote an invisible car came out of nowhere struck my vehicle and vanished.
[time=1558] The pedestrian had no idea which direction to run so I ran over him. One person wrote as I approached the intersection a stop sign suddenly appeared in a place where no stop sign has ever appeared before I wasn't able to stop in time to avoid an accident or how about this the telephone pole was approaching fast I was attempting to swerve out of its path when it struck my front end I mean you get the picture of this telephone pole moving so that you can't get out of its way.
[time=1587] Another person said I pulled away from the side of the road glanced at my mother-in-law and headed for the embankment sir fault is one more I knocked over the man he admitted it was his fault though as he had been knocked down before.
[time=1607] You know it's not my fault it's someone else's and as Christian sometimes we we we may give this past the buck excuse when God confronts us when we're caught in disobedience and it might take form such as well you know God everybody else is doing that.
[time=1626] You know I was with so and so and they wanted to do that and I mean I just kind of you know it was their choice decision I just went along with it.
[time=1637] Or when God confronts us maybe in a business practice that is less than honest we may say well you know it's company policy that's what I'm supposed to do I mean it's my boss telling me these things whatever form whatever context.
[time=1654] We like to pass the blame and I want to look at some examples and scripture and these are going to be you know somebody is going to be well known examples but let's see how they use some of these excuse then skin reason techniques and trying to get out of the blame the first we find an excuse of the past the buck excuse this is actually the first kind of excuse that was ever used Genesis chapter three Adam and Eve you know the story.
[time=1681] God has created the guard he's created you know he's created the universe and on this earth he is he's created a magnificent place all kinds of creatures in the vegetation and he's put a man and a woman Adam and Eve in this garden and given them freedom and control over all that's done is that I want you to enjoy but there's one tree I don't want you to eat up.
[time=1705] And as we read Genesis chapter three we find that they disobey and now after their disobedience they're ashamed they're frightened they're hiding from God but God confronts them in Genesis chapter three beginning with the last part of verse 11 and he asked them have you eaten from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from.
[time=1723] Now the wheels of Adam's mind are turning at this point and I don't know how prepared he is to give an answer certainly he knows God is going to confront him but he's out with it and the man said you're right God I send it was my fault no he didn't say that the man said the woman the woman that you put here with me she gave some fruit from the tree and I ate it past the buck so God turns to the woman.
[time=1752] And the woman learning from Adam God asked her what have you done she said well the serpent the serpent deceived me and so I ate.
[time=1764] Now you know the story was God impressed with their excuse I mean did it get you know that stop him know as we read on we see that God brought punishment to each to Adam to Eve to the serpent because of each misty the excuse didn't make it with God.
[time=1779] There's another example of the past the buck excuse that is even it's rather humorous I think in the next book the Bible Exodus chapter 32.
[time=1789] The context of this account is that Moses is up on the mountain in the presence of God receiving instruction the laws of the Lord of concerning how his people are to live.
[time=1800] And it's on this mountain that God inscribes in tablets of stone ten commands by which the people should live and Moses comes down from the mountain with these tablets of stone and you're probably familiar with the story he enters the camp of the people and finds them in wild celebration.
[time=1819] Frantic worship of an idol a golden calf. And and Exodus 32 beginning at verse 21 Moses approaches Aaron who has been left kind of in charge of things and Moses said to Aaron what did these people do to you that led that you led them into such great sin.
[time=1839] Aaron for goodness sake I mean did they threaten you did they say they would kill you I mean what did they do that caused you to lead them in such great sin now here are the excuses of Aaron notice he doesn't want to take responsibility for himself he's going to point first of all at the people he said well do not be angry my lord answered you know how prone these people are to evil.
[time=1863] And they said make us gods who will go before us and not now he almost even the subtly subtle way tries to shift some of the blame to Moses because he says and the people said as for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt we don't even know what has happened to him.
[time=1878] Seems to be saying Moses you know you kind of took off and you weren't around so what was I supposed to do here's where it gets a little funny so I told them hey whoever has any gold jewelry take it off and so they gave me the gold I threw it in the fire and out came this calf.
[time=1892] Yeah I just threw it in there and out came this golden cow and now you know here we are I just happen I mean same unbelievable that you go into your kids room and say who messed up this room well I don't know because I just walked out your minute going it was sure clean I walk back in it was just this is where how it happened.
[time=1912] Aaron makes excuses he doesn't accept the blame he passes the buck and again God's not impressed as we read we see that judgment comes on the people because of their sin and on this day 3000 people die.
[time=1926] The excuse doesn't matter you know because remember now what is an excuse coach Wilson said excuses what.
[time=1935] Then skin of reason stuffed with baloney we may think on the outside well I've got it all explain but.
[time=1945] Worthless inside and that's how God sees it God sees past all of that he knows.
[time=1950] Let me give you another typical excuse this is what I call the it's too hard excuse common uses among Christians might be well you know I failed so many times before I just can't do it God's calling me to do.
[time=1964] I'm going to leave the hard stop up to the professionals that's what we hire pastors to do that's what the elders are for that's what my teacher.
[time=1970] Can do but I mean it's too hard for me I mean I've never had an education I don't.
[time=1974] Never been a seminary I've never had official Bible training I don't know enough it's it's just too hard and I'm so busy I you know I'm tired and and to do what.
[time=1985] Pray God wants me to do it takes too much energy it's too difficult or or maybe it's excuse I'm not filling the blank enough and you have to put your own word there maybe it's you would say I'm not talented enough right not smart enough I'm not strong enough I'm not respected enough.
[time=2001] It's too hard excuse.
[time=2005] There's some men in the book of numbers that we read about numbers chapter 13 who gave the it's too hard excuse.
[time=2014] God is ready to take his people into the land he promised them he promised them that they he would give them the land of canon and he told them you are to go in and take take possession of it.
[time=2025] But before you do it.
[time=2028] Look at numbers chapter 13 verse two he tells Moses sends some men to explore the land of canon which I am giving to the Israelites and so you know the story Moses selected a man from each of the tribes 12 men went and spent 40 days investigating the land and they came back to give their report numbers 13 beginning of verse 27.
[time=2047] They gave Moses this account we went into the land to which you sent us and it does flow with milk and honey here's an example of the fruit.
[time=2056] But the people who live there are powerful and the cities are fortified and very large we even saw the send the sentence of anach there and the amalachites live in a gav and the hit tights the jeb you sites and the amurites live in the hill country and the canonites live near the sea and along the Jordan in other words they're saying Moses come on sure the land is great but there are too many people there and they're too powerful for us it's too hard.
[time=2079] I don't care what God says to do we can't do it they made excuses it says then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said we should go up and take possession of the land for we can certainly do it we can do it.
[time=2095] But the men who had gone up with him said we can't attack those people they are stronger than we are they weren't willing to do what God told them to do they focused in on the enormity of the of the problem instead of God's promise.
[time=2108] So they made a it's too hard excuse said we can't do it and what was God's response did the excuse make it with God.
[time=2118] God sent a whole generation of people back into the wilderness and said you will not enter the land that I've promised you because of your lack of faith because of your disobedience.
[time=2127] They're excused and impressed God he saw through it he saw past their thin skin of reason for what it was.
[time=2136] Another common excuse is the I have a better idea excuse.
[time=2140] It's kind of excuse to go something like this well God here's what you call me to do here's what you desire for my life here's how I know you call us to serve you as Christians but I've got a better idea.
[time=2151] God first of all why don't you just let me spend time getting my life my family secure let me build some financial security and get things all settled and then sometime in the future I'll be I'll have more time I'll have more resources to give back to you.
[time=2167] Doesn't that sound like a better idea guy you just wait around while or maybe it's something like well God I know you call us to share Christ to talk about the good news to people but God you know I've got a better idea what I think I'll just live a life that is such a good example that somehow people will be impressed by that but I don't want to talk about God or talk about Jesus because that might offend somebody so let me just be a silent witness don't you think that's a better idea.
[time=2196] And we give excuses just like King Saul did on a couple of occasions just look at one in first Samuel chapter 15.
[time=2208] God had given the instruction to King to King Saul through the prophet pre Samuel he was supposed to go and to wipe out the malakites and first Samuel 15 we read about it in the first two verses.
[time=2224] God is speaking said I will punish the malakites for what they did to Israel when they way laid them as they came out from Egypt.
[time=2231] Now go speaking to Saul go attack the malakites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them do not spare them put to death men and women and children and infants cattle and sheep and camels and donkeys in other words everything is to be wiped out.
[time=2247] This is a total judgment you need leave nothing living so Saul and his army set out they attack the malakites but instead of destroying everything as God had commanded he took the king prisoner and he also kept the good sheep and cattle.
[time=2263] The next day Samuel goes to Saul and we pick up the story in verse 13 and said when Samuel reached him Saul said to Samuel the Lord bless you I have carried out the Lord's instructions.
[time=2276] But Samuel said well then what is this bleeding of the sheep in my ears and what is this lowering of the cattle that I hear Saul answered and here's a thin skin of reason.
[time=2288] Well the soldiers brought them from the malakites they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the Lord your God don't you think that's a good idea Samuel I kept them we just we totally destroyed the rest of them but we kept the best so that we could offer them as sacrifice.
[time=2303] Don't you think that was I know God said destroy everything but don't you think this is a better idea and God didn't think it was a better idea.
[time=2312] Samuel said to Saul because you have done this God has rejected you as king and another will be chosen in your place.
[time=2321] God if we say we have a better a better idea and we offer that as an excuse God sees it for what it is a thin skin of reason but it's worthless.
[time=2335] How about this it's another excuse the I'm not so bad excuse all right you caught me but listen I'm not so bad.
[time=2343] A few years ago the mayor of Washington DC tried to put a good face on the hundreds of shootings and stabbings and other murders that were taking place in the nation's capital and when he was asked about these things he explained with this comment he said outside of the killings we have one of the lowest crime rates in the country.
[time=2366] As like saying outside of the fact that I beat my wife every night I don't treat her too bad we try to do that yeah well okay I mean you're right I have this problem but I mean on the whole I mean look over here I've got a lot of good things I'm really not so bad.
[time=2383] And in our Christianity these excuses might come out in terms like well I'm not so bad I'm not as bad as so and so we can always look around the church and find someone that's a little worse trouble than we are.
[time=2395] I'm not as bad as them well after all got I mean you should be impressed I'm in church you know most every week.
[time=2402] I mean religion is important to me I mean I don't want to take it too seriously but it is important to me and when you consider the world as a whole.
[time=2411] I mean the bad shape the world is and you look at all the junk going on around us I don't look too bad.
[time=2418] I'm not so bad I just don't want to take things too seriously I had a student I was talking to this past week.
[time=2424] We were talking about Christianity we were talking about the call of Christ in our life and what it means to be a follower of Jesus.
[time=2431] And he stopped me at one point he said you know you Baptist you just you take things so seriously so what do you mean?
[time=2437] He said well he just make this you know Christianity it's like it's every day something and you have to be serious about it all the time.
[time=2445] And I tried to help him understand well that's not a Baptist thing that's that's just a Jesus thing that's what he said when he described being a disciple.
[time=2453] It's not a denomination it's what Jesus taught.
[time=2458] And I don't want to make it sound like I'm talking about some legalistic system that you know every day I have to get up and go through my checklist and make sure I do all those things and that's what being a Christian is.
[time=2467] I think some people and they think Baptist that's what they think of me or us.
[time=2471] But on the other hand the call of Christ is a call to come every day and to serve him and to follow him.
[time=2479] And it's not to weigh ourselves to see well yeah I've got these bad things but those can be excused because I have enough good stuff on this side of the account.
[time=2490] Jesus wants to open those rooms of our life too and to deal with the issues of disobedience and sin and not to excuse them away.
[time=2498] In fact Jesus said that there's going to be a group of people one day who stand before him and their expectation is that they're going to be led in to be part of the kingdom of God.
[time=2505] That's what they fully expect and God is going to say to them I never knew you and they're going to have an excuse and their excuse is that I'm not it's an I'm not so bad excuse.
[time=2517] Matthew chapter 7 verses 21 and following Jesus said not everyone who says to me Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven.
[time=2527] Many will say to me on that day there will many be many who believe that they're ready to enter into the kingdom many will say to me on that day Lord Lord didn't we prophesy in your name.
[time=2539] Didn't we drive out demons didn't we perform miracles I mean we did good things and Jesus said I will say to them plainly there will be no question about this to be very plain.
[time=2550] I never knew you away from me you evil doers you see you can't justify a lifestyle and a pattern of a disobedience to God by saying yeah but I do these good things God desires a heart that belongs to him.
[time=2564] A heart that has a passion to know God and to do what he wants me to do wants you to do.
[time=2571] And we struggle through that and yes we sin but the desire of our heart is to serve him.
[time=2578] And God realizes our excuses for what they are just then skins of reason stuffed with bowl only.
[time=2587] Here's another one it's what I call the I have more important things excuse.
[time=2593] This excuse may sound something like this you know I have I have to provide for my family.
[time=2599] And that that keeps me kind of busy I mean that's that's a responsibility I have I mean God's even given me that responsibility and so.
[time=2607] I don't have time for some of these other things I've got to do that or or my job just keeps me so busy God I can't do I can't do this or that you know what God gives us those responsibilities and expects us.
[time=2618] I expect me to be responsible my wife and to my children to help provide for my family he expects me to do my job and my work to the best of my ability but not to sacrifice obedience to him by doing those things.
[time=2633] Those are never an excuse for being disobedient to God for not doing what he calls me to do.
[time=2643] Look at Luke chapter 14. Jesus is teaching about the kingdom of God and he gives us a parable.
[time=2657] Luke chapter 14 beginning with verse 16.
[time=2661] Jesus said a certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited come for everything is now ready now in this story as we read the context it's very obvious Jesus is talking about the invitation of God to be part of his kingdom.
[time=2681] But the invitation went out and read the next verse they all alike began to make excuses the first said well I've just bought a field I must go see it please excuse me another said well I've just bought five yoke of oxen I'm on my way to try them out please excuse me still another said well I just got married so I can't come I mean they all had important things to do social responsibilities business responsibilities family responsibilities.
[time=2704] Did the excuses make it go on to read the servant came back and reported this to his master then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind the lane serve the servant said what you ordered has been done but there is still room then the master told a servant go out to the roads in the country lanes and make them make them come in so that my house will be full and I tell you not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet the ones who made an excuse.
[time=2733] Will not get a taste they're excuses didn't matter I have more important things to do and Jesus said they're left out of the banquet there's no place the table for them God recognizes those excuses for what they're let me just mention one more.
[time=2751] We'll call this the personal weakness excuse the excuse that says you know that's that's just who I am you have to understand that it's just part of me.
[time=2762] You may remember it made national news when the Beverly Hills policeman Paul Kramer ticketed jaja go for for having expired license plates on the back of her Rolls Royce and she responded to him by slapping him in the face.
[time=2778] When asked why she would do such a thing here was her explanation.
[time=2783] Well I am Hungarian we are descendants of gingus con in a till of the hunt we are Hungarian freedom fighters so that explains it.
[time=2796] I mean it's just it's just part of my nature is just how could I help myself that's that's who I am so maybe a personal weakness in the church we hear this when people say well you know I know maybe that's a sin but it's part of my personality.
[time=2812] Some even make it more spiritual by saying is just my thorn in the flesh.
[time=2817] And somehow that God's cause me to to be this way to have this sin because he wants to keep me humble so you'll have to excuse it because I'm sure he does.
[time=2827] Or I'm this way because my parents were this way.
[time=2832] It's much like the people in his equal chapter 18 who are complaining to God why are you judging us you're punishing us for something that was our parents fault.
[time=2840] They ate the sour grapes they said and our teeth are set on edge and God rebuked them and said how dare you say that God said the soul that sins is the one that will die.
[time=2850] I judge your parents for their sins I will judge you for your sins if you live a life of righteousness you will live if you live a life of unrighteousness you will die.
[time=2859] But don't try to blame your parents you're responsible for your own life.
[time=2863] Yes my parents have had a big effect and impact on my life. Yes I have tendencies I believe for certain sins or weaknesses because I grew up with parents who were imperfect and learned patterns after them but that no way excuses me.
[time=2881] Some will even say well you know what my sin is really it's actually a disease it's genetic and I'm not going to try to explain the science of everything I'm just going to I'll agree with you I believe even physically even genetically you may have more of a propensity to certain sins you may have more inclination to certain temptations and I have and I have to others than you.
[time=2905] The Bible is very clear that we will struggle in this lifetime with tendencies and desires to sin even as Christians we have carried through we carry on habits of sinfulness in our life but that is not an excuse nowhere in scripture you find that as an excuse to indulge in disobedience to live in sin.
[time=2923] In fact it's very interesting Romans chapter 8 verse 9 Paul writes the Romans he says you however are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the spirit and if the spirit of God lives in you.
[time=2938] If anyone does not have the spirit of Christ he does not belong to Christ and a couple verses later he says therefore brothers we have an obligation but it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it.
[time=2948] If you live according to the sinful nature you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live because those who are led by the spirit of God are sons of God in other words.
[time=2958] Paul is saying that's not a legitimate excuse for the Christian because you have a power in your life that is greater than those tendencies to sin.
[time=2966] That's what the spirit of God does in us he gives us the ability to live a life that is not given to sin.
[time=2977] He not only sets us free from the penalty but sets us free from sin's power in our life.
[time=2984] Now some may say well wait a second Tether you skip the whole chapter look at chapter 9 I mean in chapter 7 of Romans and chapter 7 Paul talks about the struggle.
[time=2993] Paul actually says you know the good things I want to do I can't do what you know what's this going on I here's the things that I want I try to but I find that the sin inside of me just makes me do the wrong stuff.
[time=3004] I mean that sounds like that's pretty good reason sounds like he's saying it's not my fault it's just the sin inside because I really want to do the good thing.
[time=3012] But folks you understand you read what Paul is writing about in Romans he's talking about the place of God's law in our life.
[time=3019] And Paul is making the argument that when it comes to the law of God the instruction the commands of God the law of God is good but it cannot save us.
[time=3026] In fact what the law does is it frustrates us and it shows our imperfections and Paul is saying in Romans chapter 7 he says you know when I studied the law and I looked at the law I wanted to obey it.
[time=3037] I wanted to follow it I wanted to live it but when I tried I could not and he comes to the end of chapter 7 he says what a wretched man what a miserable man I am who will rescue me from this body of death.
[time=3049] And he gives the answer in the last verse of chapter 7 he says thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=3056] Now that's just not some quick easy answer that you know I used to struggle with sin but now also in Jesus somehow comes my life and I never struggle with sin anymore I don't believe that's what Paul is saying.
[time=3067] But he is saying that there is a solution there is an answer there is never a cause for us to give the excuse the so called reason that I couldn't help myself I had to send because it's part of my nature Paul is saying through Jesus Christ you are recreated.
[time=3082] The Spirit of God lives in you and in the very heart of hearts in the very center of you now God is recreating you and part of that is giving you the desire to do what's right and the ability to do what's right.
[time=3094] And you never have the excuse of saying I couldn't help myself in fact Peter writes and one of his letters he says that God has given you everything you need to live a life of godliness without excuse.
[time=3108] I mean what does God think of our excuses then skins of reason.
[time=3114] Let me just make a few final observations when we consider the excuses of our life when we are caught in disobedience.
[time=3123] One thing I'd encourage you to realize that your excuses my excuses probably tend to draw greater attention to our sins especially to the people around us.
[time=3132] When I'm constantly making excuses for my sinfulness I don't know if that even presses the people that I'm making excuses to other than God.
[time=3139] I think it draws more attention when I try to cover them up many times. When I was in junior high I had a pair of jeans that I wore one of my favorite pair of jeans and I wore them a lot.
[time=3150] And because I wore them a lot they got a little snag on the back pocket a little hole that just began to unravel a little bit.
[time=3156] I mean you couldn't see it. It didn't bother me but it bothered my mom. She was afraid that it would catch on something or it would be unsightly.
[time=3162] So my mom decided to cover that hole with a patch and she ironed on a patch a big patch that looked like a bandaid on the back of my favorite jeans.
[time=3172] Well forget it I'm not wearing those things anymore. I'm not walking around with you know a big bandaid back there that everybody can see because in my mom's effort to cover over an obvious flaw she drew more attention to it.
[time=3185] Sometimes in our excuses we do the same thing.
[time=3189] Another thing I think we should realize that God desires your honesty and my honesty pure and simple pure and simple honesty is what God wants.
[time=3199] Matthew 537 Jesus is speaking and he says you know you don't need to go into these big oaths and saying I swear by this or that or the other thing that I'm telling the truth.
[time=3210] Jesus said you were to be characterized by people who are so honest filled with such integrity that your yes means yes and your no means no.
[time=3217] That's what he said simply let your yes be yes and your no be no. That's simple.
[time=3223] And then whether we responding to people whether we're responding to God our response should be honest responses of yes or no not no but I've got a good reason for it or yes but I can explain that just yes or no.
[time=3236] I mean God knows our hearts anyway.
[time=3240] As I grew up my parents would mention one of those phrases that I would always bother me and I'd always say I'll never say that to my own kids and now I find myself saying it to my own children.
[time=3253] And it was when I would begin to make an excuse and they got no excuses just do it.
[time=3259] And I find myself to my own child no I don't want no excuses just do it. And you know what I think God in the same sort of way when we begin to give our sins, sins of reason.
[time=3270] I think God's response to us is hey I don't I see past all that I don't need to hear excuses.
[time=3277] You're my child I just want you to obey just do it I can't see into your life I don't know that.
[time=3284] What may be those things that you're making excuses for.
[time=3291] It may be that there is something in your life that you have not yet dealt with.
[time=3297] Some sin that God has pointed out and you continue to make excuses.
[time=3301] God wants you to stop making excuses.
[time=3304] Maybe something that God has called you to do an act of obedience that you have just kept putting off and maybe one of these excuses you keep using.
[time=3311] God simply wants us to obey out of a desire of devotion and love for him.
[time=3316] Just obey and I need to stop making excuses you need to stop making excuses and live a life of simple honest obedience to God.
[time=3328] Father thank you this morning that you remind us.
[time=3332] Through examples and scripture of men and women who didn't just live perfect godly lives but God we even see their inadequacies.
[time=3339] We see their weaknesses we see their failures we see their excuses.
[time=3344] And God you teach us through those how you look at that.
[time=3349] God help help me to be a man who stops making excuses.
[time=3352] Help us to be a church and people who stop giving justifications and reasons, finger pointing for the things that we do that are wrong.
[time=3361] God help us to be willing to be different, to be set apart, to be so honest and filled with such integrity in life that we're willing to take the risks to follow you into obey no matter what it costs without excuse.
[time=3375] Please by your spirit work in our hearts to give us that desire.
[time=3379] I pray in Jesus name. Amen.
