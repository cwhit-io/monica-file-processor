[time=0] And here's the phrase, striving together for the faith of the gospel, striving together
[time=10] for the faith of the gospel.
[time=12] The story I want to tell you this morning is about how there's a nucleus of people in this church that are beginning to sense with a new sense of excitement.
[time=23] How this church can look at the next six or seven years and on into the next millennia
[time=30] of how we can effectively strive together for the faith of the gospel.
[time=46] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship which we hope
[time=53] you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=56] Thank you for joining us.
[time=58] One of the most exciting things in the world is being a part of a team that is striving together to reach a common objective.
[time=66] The Lord has called His people to strive together for the faith of the gospel.
[time=71] He often views the local church as a team of spiritual athletes striving together to win a spiritual victory.
[time=79] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore challenges the people of God to strive together for the glory of God.
[time=85] Our special music includes Read La Favor and Denise Mitchell.
[time=97] Please join our Sanctuary Choir and Orchestra as they begin our service.
[time=127] Before the King of New Orleans King, when there was something you were everything, before God
[time=144] nation stood, before evil or good, you were forever.
[time=153] Before the night, before the day, before the landless one from play, before the night, before
[time=166] death, before the first breath, you were forever.
[time=175] Forever King, forever King, a heart as we should know, my birth is my last, my future, my last.
[time=191] The strength of all my heart, the love of the angels, the tear of the landless angels, forever King, forever King, forever.
[time=221] After the skies, after the sun, after the rivers, all run bright, when we heard this
[time=240] song, the heavens roar, you be forever, when we together round your door, for every nation
[time=257] on our own, and if one God will praise you, Lord, you are forever, and ever.
[time=269] You are forever, and every nation on our own, and if one God will praise you, Lord, you are forever.
[time=288] My birth is my last, my future, my last, the strength of all my heart, the love of the angels, the tear of life, the
[time=307] same Lord, forever King, forever King, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever.
[time=327] Forever King, forever King, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever.
[time=356] We're so happy you tuned in today to the Bible hour, and right now I want to take just a moment to tell you about something very special.
[time=378] The Daily Devotional Calls Life Walk. This guide will help you in your daily walk with Christ, with wonderful comments and scriptures.
[time=385] Life Walk is sent out six times a year to all our Founders Club members, and for a limited time you can receive a free copy of Life Walk to Enjoy, simply by writing us here at the Bible hour.
[time=395] Our address is the Bible hour, 7,400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815.
[time=401] Write us today, we'd love to hear from you.
[time=421] All my guilt and my despair, Jesus took on him there, and come, or recovers it all.
[time=446] Nothing between my soul and the Savior, so that His lesser face may be seen.
[time=465] Nothing preventing the host of His favor, keep the way clear, let nothing between.
[time=486] Nothing between my soul and the Savior, not of His words, delusively.
[time=505] If I have renounced all earthly pleasure, Jesus is mine, let nothing between.
[time=526] Our greater than all, that the world can impart, was this message that came down to my heart.
[time=541] How that Jesus followed for my sin, He did it on, and cavalry covers his heart.
[time=561] There's cavalry covers it all, all my past, with its sin, and its ugly stain, all of my guilt.
[time=580] And my despair, my Jesus took on him there, and come, or recovers it all.
[time=604] Keep the way clear, and let nothing between.
[time=631] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today.
[time=634] Some of you have written in and told us that you're watching the Bible Hour, because you can't get to your church services, because of the weather in Indiana at this time of the year.
[time=643] We're glad to have you, and we hope that you will continue watching us when you can.
[time=648] And then a little earlier in our program, Jeff Carlson, our announcer told you about the Founders Club, and how you can receive a free copy of life walk, our daily devotional.
[time=658] And I just want to remind you to please write to us today, and tell us that you want the daily devotional, and then some information on how you can become a Founders Club member, and support the ministry of the Bible Hour.
[time=672] While Russell, this was the week when our President Clinton gave his State of the Union address, and it seems to be the time of the year when everybody is setting their goals for the year, and Black Hawk is no exception, you have some ideas for Black Hawk in the future.
[time=687] Well, that's right, and this morning we're going to give you an opportunity to really listen in to a discussion we'll have as a family, Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=695] We hope you'll enjoy that, and feel a sense of encouragement by the things we believe God is leading us to do.
[time=700] But Pete, as you know, I have never been more excited about the church, the mission of the church, and in particular, Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=707] And all of our numbers are up, which is a good place to start. Our attendance on Sunday morning is up, our adult Bible Fellowship Ministry is up, our giving is up, and so it's a good foundation to look to the next 12 months and say, what are we going to do, and how are we going to do it?
[time=722] The thing that we're dealing with as a church is how do we re-articulate and refocus our vision for the next 10 years, which I think you have to do.
[time=731] As you know, we're celebrating our 25th anniversary as a church, and it's about that time to take a look and critically analyze, who are we, where are we going, and how do we continue to build the enthusiasm so people will volunteer.
[time=743] And you know all about volunteerism, the living Christmas tree brings so many, many folks to out of our congregation to help and to accomplish a project.
[time=752] And so we're anticipating a great year, and our whole objective is to involve our people in a more vital way in what God's doing.
[time=761] Well, there are some specific examples of men in our church who started out as lay people, and then they've really been called of God some, went on to seminary, some just were called into full time work and other churches.
[time=773] And as really exciting for us, because not only do we want to propagate the gospel, but we want to reproduce, be that kind of a church that's sending people not only to the local ministries in the United States, but around the world, and we're excited about some of those ministries too.
[time=793] Right, and I think when a person grows up into the ministry in a local church, it's more than just academics. They get a chance to see how it actually works, and I think they're more effective when they actually minister in a local church themselves.
[time=806] Well, as Pastor Russ said, you'll be hearing some of the intimate things that go on at Black Hawk Baptist Church, and I hope that will be interesting for you, and that you will remember it and not only pray for the Bible hour, but also for the ministry, all the ministries of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=822] We're delighted that the Bible hour is just a portion of it, and that we can be with you today. Well, you've already heard some good music, and you're going to hear some more music from Denise Mitchell, and then the message from our Pastor Teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=837] The world will try to satisfy that deep longing in your soul. You may search this wide world, but you'll be just as before.
[time=866] You'll never find true satisfaction until you found Lord. For only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=891] For only Jesus can satisfy your soul, and only He can change your heart and make you whole.
[time=913] He'll give you peace, you've never knew. Sweet love and joy, and heaven too. For only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=938] Oh, so are you weary and trouble. No light in the darkness you see.
[time=953] There's light for a look at the Savior, and life for abundant and free.
[time=970] Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in His wonderful face. And the things of earth will most rangelydin in the light of His glory.
[time=999] And grace for only Jesus can satisfy your soul. And only He can change your heart and make you whole.
[time=1027] He'll give you peace, you've never knew. Sweet love and joy, and heaven too. For only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=1053] Yes, only Jesus can satisfy your soul.
[time=1080] Amen, thank you, Denise, and Scott. Such true words.
[time=1085] Many of you have asked, and I'm thankful for your interest, and I thought I'd just give a little bit of an update on some of my family and friends back in California who have gone through the earthquake.
[time=1097] My sister lives in Valencia, California, which is where Heidi and I used to live with our kids before we moved here, and Valencia is maybe four or five miles from the epicenter of that earthquake.
[time=1110] She was, as most people were, sleeping at the time of the earthquake, and in her bedroom has one of those big, omwars, and it fell would have come right directly on top of her on the bed, but it hit something first.
[time=1121] I think another wall, and so it didn't actually land on her, but she was jolted from her sleep and made her way into the courtyard.
[time=1129] It just so happens that Kelly Bird, who has been here to preach, a good friend of mine, he and his wife, Kebra, and their son also live in that same condominium complex.
[time=1137] Kelly was in the bed by himself. Kebra, his wife, had been taking care of their little son, and so she was playing mom on the couch kind of up and down, and their seven foot bookshelf and their bedroom came down on top of Kelly, and then they have also an omwar that came down, so he was pinned underneath all this stuff.
[time=1154] Big kid, six foot seven, he fought his way out from underneath all that.
[time=1158] Kebra got up to try to get to their son, and the earthquake threw her into the wall on the left of their living room.
[time=1166] She struggled to her feet, and it threw her back across the living room into the kitchen counter.
[time=1171] By this time, she's in hysterics because she wants to go save her son and get there. Eventually got ahold of him, and they made their way out of the second story part of their condominium down to this main area where my sister gathered in a number of other Christian friends of ours that live in that same complex.
[time=1187] Just about that time, Kelly heard a voice crying from a balcony. It was a 76-year-old lady blind and deaf standing out there crying for help, so he ran back into the situation and grabbed her and carried her into safety.
[time=1202] The terrifying thing was the continuing aftershocks that just kept hitting over and over and over and over again. I was finally on the phone with Kelly. We could finally connect later that evening about 11 o'clock our time.
[time=1213] He was calling me from the emergency room. He had slipped at some point in the process and cut a tendon in his little finger, and he was getting help for that.
[time=1222] While we were on the phone, another big aftershock hit, and you could hear the quivering in his own voice. He'd been so traumatized all day long in these repercussions and they'd not gone back into their condominium. They were scared to death of it, still feeling all that.
[time=1239] My folks and Heidi's folks, they all lived two and a half hours away. They were awakened by the earthquake but no damage. What was common were all the personal effects would just explode out of everybody's cupboards and computers would hit the ground and stereos and refrigerators would break.
[time=1255] Kelly said to me, "Russell you and I, we've lived through eight earthquakes in California together." He said, "Forget all those. This was completely different because it didn't rumble and roll as most of those we'd gone through had. This one just took a hold of you and shook you."
[time=1270] So he was very upset by the whole thing. The masters college, they had to evacuate all the dorms and the kids of the college slept the next two nights on the tennis courts. They're at the college, which tells you a little something about their weather.
[time=1286] I'm not going to bring that up.
[time=1294] They fixed the problems in the dorms the next two days and they were able to put all the kids back in there. Of course all their personal effects were all of the floor so that took a long time to clean up.
[time=1303] The freeway damage really cut off the masters college, which is also where John MacArthur lives out in that area, from Grace Community Church and the seminary.
[time=1312] So you couldn't even get back and forth for a number of days. Although I do understand that they've made alternate routes and Grace Community Church is supposed to be holding services today and the students are back in class at the college and the seminary resumes its progress, that'll happen Monday.
[time=1329] So they've all been pretty shook by the whole experience, no pun and pun intended. But I thought maybe we could just as a church take a moment this morning and pause for a word of prayer, even as the Grace Community Church and the church were Kelly ministers, Grace Baptist and all the other churches in Southern California are they're holding their services now and I thought it'd be a good thing for us just to pray for them.
[time=1348] Would you bow your heads with me and let's do that.
[time=1353] Father, we recognize that as of late you have really traumatized Southern California, they are staggering already under the weight of the debt of their state.
[time=1365] The industry is leaving, people are deserting, the economy is so difficult.
[time=1371] Add to that then there were the riots that have burned much of the city and inflamed the hearts of people one against another and now to see this great shaking of the same area.
[time=1384] In Lord it causes us to remember you are sovereign that you control the events of our lives. We know that you orchestrate events to soften people to the gospel, to awaken them, to give them spiritual vision to see reality and to bend their knees, the knees of their heart to come to Christ and to be saved and we believe you would be doing that even now.
[time=1405] And so we pray for the unsaved that they would wake up and come to Christ. At the same time we pray for the believers, all of them there in Southern California, alike precious faith, churches.
[time=1418] They too are shaken and struggling. They wonder about their own church facilities. They are going to be concerned. I'm sure about their budgets as people in their church now will have other needs financially just to keep their own households running and who knows how that will impact ministry.
[time=1434] While we pray you give those leaders and the people of those churches great wisdom and courage and strength to see the opportunities for the gospel, to see the opportunity to encourage one another and build each other up and to hang on to each other and to really be lights in the darkness.
[time=1450] Lord we love you and we praise you and we thank you for the kindred spirit we feel in our hearts for the thousands of Christians in that area. We don't even know and probably will never know.
[time=1460] But we know they know you and in you we find our common bond and our heart is that you would strengthen and establish them. And so as a church we pray for them in Christ name. Amen.
[time=1472] Well if you would take your Bibles this morning and let's go back to the book of Philippians. Those of you who are with us on a regular basis know we're studying the book of Philippians but instead of going to chapter 4 which is where we really are in our study.
[time=1485] I want to ask you to go to chapter 1. There's a phrase in a verse there in chapter 1 that is really burning its way into my heart and mind over these last few months and really these last few weeks.
[time=1499] And my intent I should tell you right up front this morning is not to preach so much an expositional message I want to instead tell you a story.
[time=1506] A story I think may be the best kept secret here at Black Hawk Baptist Church it's been going on for about 12 months and it's time now to kind of reveal to you what's been going on behind the scenes that's so exciting and really that this verse talks about.
[time=1522] And at the end I also want to be honest I'm going to ask for your help in a particular project. It won't require a lot of your time maybe 15 or 20 minutes somewhere in the next six weeks but I'm going to ask for all of your help.
[time=1534] And this message is not only to tell us an exciting story of something that's been happening but also to bring you to a point of decision to be willing to help us with the project we're undertaking.
[time=1546] The verse Philippians chapter 1 verse 27 says, "Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that whether I come and see you or remain absent I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel."
[time=1566] The little phrase that I like so well is the phrase striving together for the faith of the gospel. The word striving together in the Greek is soon Athleto and it gives itself away Athleto from which we get the word Athletic, the little word in front of it which is connected to it is together.
[time=1586] It is describing the Athletic striving of a team or a group of people or a corporation or a company and the metaphor is that of Athletics striving together to accomplish a particular goal.
[time=1598] The verse strengthens the idea as you notice that you are standing firm in one spirit talking about unity with one mind so with one spirit in one mind view yourself as an Athletic team that is striving and agonizing to accomplish a particular objective.
[time=1617] What is that objective? It is also found in verse 27 the faith of the gospel. So it involves us in grabbing ahold of each other with one spirit and one mind to begin to strive together not even really for ourselves although faith of the gospel would include our own faith and our own maturity and our own growth but ultimately for the faith of the gospel as it would impact an unsaved world.
[time=1644] And I know the most exciting periods of my life, the most exciting memories of my life came to me first as a junior high student as a high school student playing on athletic teams and the sense of camaraderie and the sense of unity and the sense of desire and how we would find ourselves submitting to a direction and every guy playing his proper part in fact we are looking forward to leaving church today and going and seeing some of the best athletes of the world perform and they will win if they strive together.
[time=1673] And if they fail to do that they will lose regardless of how talented any one individual may be on that given team.
[time=1682] So it's a powerful metaphor and God is looking at the church and he's describing us as athletes who are striving together for a common cause and a common goal and my experience both in athletics as limited as that was and then later in the church which has been the principal part of my life since I've been 20.
[time=1699] That has been when I find myself agonizing with fellow Christians for a common goal I'm never happier.
[time=1705] I'm never more excited, I'm never more alive, I'm never more committed, I'm never more willing to sacrifice my time and my treasure and my investment to see this thing accomplished.
[time=1715] Because I know that if I'll do my part and the next person does their part and we all come together in this wonderful marvelous thing called the church that great things can occur that I could never accomplish on my own.
[time=1727] We do it once a year in a dramatic way it's called a living Christmas tree right 500 of us volunteer our time and our talent and our treasure and we erect both a tree itself and then fill it with people who have worked hundreds of hours to sing properly and all the lighting and all the stuff behind the scenes and we end up with something that is far bigger than any one of us could ever accomplish our witness and our testimony and our impact on the 20,000 people that come every Christmas season could never be accomplished by one individual unless his name.
[time=1756] To pull that stuff off a bunch of common folk like you and me need to bind together and strive together and agonize together for the goal that's the picture of the church.
[time=1770] Look at chapter 2 verse 2 just to strengthen and lay the biblical base a little stronger before I tell you the story.
[time=1777] The same theme make my joy complete Paul is writing to this church the question obviously is well how do we do that how do we make your joy complete as our spiritual father as the one who birthed us in Christ.
[time=1789] By being of the same mind maintaining the same love united in spirit and intent on one purpose those are just different words to describe the same reality as chapter 1 verse 27.
[time=1801] Ladies and gentlemen I have something to tell you this morning we were built for this. This is what living is all about.
[time=1809] We live in a day in a society that exonerates individualism and even the pace of our life almost pushes us away from the corporate community of the body of Christ.
[time=1821] But we are not complete and we are not whole and we are not satisfied and we are not all that God would have us to be until we see ourselves as a part of the athletic team of the church if you will striving together for the faith of the gospel and we get the evidence and be strengthened and be encouraged by the cumulative result of our efforts.
[time=1841] The body of Christ.
[time=1845] Well the story I wanted to tell you begins about 12 or 13 months ago over on the north campus in our little staff meeting where the staff meets every single week on Wednesdays and we just had something in our hearts and we sensed we needed a different forum a new forum to strive together for the gospel and at that time we weren't even using that phrase we were just talking about it without even thinking about this particular verse.
[time=1866] We knew we had a forum with our elders and our senior staff once a month on Saturday we call those elder meetings and we would open in prayer there would be a devotion and we were committing ourselves to the Lord but it turned out that most of our discussion was about the business matters of our church budget and building and major decisions that you entrust them to make on your behalf as we administrative the church.
[time=1888] There was another meeting going on another forum it was called a deacon's meeting and there are the deacons who lead all of our adult Bible fellowships would meet and they too would pray and they too would have a devotion but it seemed to be just about the ABF ministry itself and it just seemed like it wasn't enough and we were concerned that the elders and even the deacons and the senior staff there was never a time when all of us as the leadership of the church would meet together.
[time=1912] So we braved out with a new idea and said how about we have what we call just a leadership meeting not an elder's meeting not a deacon's meeting just a leadership meeting and we'll invite all the senior staff and all the elders and all the deacons and this is what we're going to do.
[time=1926] We're just going to talk about and be concerned over the spiritual nurturing and the caring and the development and the growth of the people of our church and our missions ministry and all the things that represent the broader perspective of Black Hawk.
[time=1942] And we want a time when we can get on our knees together and pray for the flock and pray for the husband and wife relationships and pray for the children as they grow up and pray for the ministries of our church and a spiritual venue that says God please by the power of your spirit enable us to do the job you want us to do.
[time=1960] And we were longing for a time when we could sing together and with that worship God as a leadership team no Roberts rules of order no business decisions no money decisions no building decisions let's just pretend for a minute that we're the new testament church and we don't have those concerns and we want to focus on the people and the ministry of our church.
[time=1980] Well we raised the idea and all everybody seemed to think well yeah we need that let's do that and so we met for the very first time about 12 months ago on a Saturday morning north campus room I think 126.
[time=1992] We thought we needed a little help to make these meetings as meaningful as we possibly could and so we invited a man into our midst really a consultant.
[time=2001] His name is Steve Resh he recently had moved at that time to Fort Wayne to be a part of the teaching faculty at Taylor University Fort Wayne campus business department understood a lot about the things we were trying to strive for having been in ministry much of his life even pastor at one time and we felt he could help us make those meetings as meaningful as possible.
[time=2024] We were a little nervous didn't know very well but we were out on faith he walks through the door on the first meeting I introduced him the rest of the gang all 40 or 50 of us are there and he says would you guys take your bibles for a minute and open it to Isaiah chapter 49.
[time=2038] Would you come with me there just for a minute Isaiah 49.
[time=2043] I'd never seen the verse before in my life didn't know where we were going I mean maybe I'd read it in seminary but I'd never thought about it.
[time=2052] Isaiah 49.6.
[time=2062] Isaiah is one of those major prophets Isaiah Jeremiah lamentations kind of in the middle end of the Old Testament but middle of the whole Bible says there in Isaiah 49.6 he says it is too small a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel.
[time=2081] I will also make you a light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth.
[time=2088] See he's talking to the nation of Israel he's talking to the leadership of the nation of Israel and he's saying to them it's not enough that you just raise up the 12 tribes of Jacob which would have been another way of referring to the nation of Israel the chosen people of God.
[time=2101] That's good don't stop doing that pursue excellence in that endeavor but that's not enough.
[time=2108] There's this additional thing that you need to understand is your mission that needs to you need to broaden your heart as wide as this look at it again in verse 6 the end of it.
[time=2116] I will also make you a light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth. This is one of many Old Testament passages in which the heart of God is seen to be bleeding for the salvation of people outside the nation of Israel.
[time=2130] In fact he raised Israel up so that they could be a light to the other nations they were his chosen instrument to reach the other nations the Gentiles as they were called with the gospel with the knowledge of the true and saving God.
[time=2145] Well then Steve said to us take the eight and a half eleven sheet of paper in front of you in the pen that's been provided in the privacy of your own heart in mind for a moment take 15 minutes and just write down all the ways you see Blackhawk Baptist Church doing that and the ways we could do that.
[time=2159] Even better in the future so the silence came and all of us were diligently writing our ideas down.
[time=2166] He then made us all number off one two three four five six one two three four five six one so we got into groups the one groups went into this particular classroom the two group went into this classroom.
[time=2175] He told us now what I want you to do is I want you to go around the table in your small groups now and everybody gets to share their best idea first go around the group and he gave us these big white sheets of paper that we'd stick up on the wall with black pens and we had a secretary.
[time=2188] One of the group that would agree to write down our ideas so everybody shared their best idea then they share their second best idea then their third best until we exhausted the list.
[time=2197] Then he came back about twenty minutes later and said now what I want you to do is make one list out of all these pages of your five best ideas.
[time=2205] The ones you like the most the ones you think of be most effective.
[time=2208] We did that in our group the twos did it and there's the threes did it and theirs and then he called us all back together again and we brought just our one list of five best ideas we put those on the wall and the secretary stood up of each group and listed through his ideas and why they felt they would be effective.
[time=2222] It was unbelievable time you know what happened two things happened in that meeting at least that I remember one is we got a whole lot of really good ideas about the church and how to make the church more effective but the second and probably the most important aspect that occurred.
[time=2237] Is that through the process we got it we got a little bit of a glimpse we got the peak through a window into the other guys hard and the other guys mine and the other guys saw and the other guys commitment and the other guys love for God and the other guys understanding of the word of God see when you're sitting in that little group and they're sharing their ideas you're not just hearing an idea you're learning something about the guy next to you and the guy next to him and the guy next to him.
[time=2260] And I found myself going these guys are unbelievable these these men have the same heart that I have they they've been studying the same word of God they love the same savior they have one heart and one spirit and one purpose.
[time=2273] And I think everybody in the room began to sense that and we kind of floated out the room at the end of the meeting because we'd sense the spirit of God had met with us and revealed to us just how incredibly unified we really really were.
[time=2287] Well we kept meeting Saturday after Saturday once a month for about nine months and every time we have a new assignment and it came to our realization that what we needed to do was to formulate a mission statement for our church.
[time=2300] A mission statement for our church and we worked on it for a number of months and finally came up with it it's in your bulletin would you take a look at it find your bulletin wherever you tucked it.
[time=2309] I asked the people to put it in there so you could actually see it I just want to spend a minute talking with you about it over viewing it.
[time=2318] You'll see it there in the middle section the Black Hawk Baptist Church mission statement.
[time=2322] This is the one that the elders and the deacons and the senior staff labored over and has written and in fact has even been approved by the board of elders as our mission statement.
[time=2332] It says this our mission is to respond to the word of God now that may sound like a simple sentence we worked a long time on that because what we were trying to say is this.
[time=2342] As elders and and deacons and senior staff we did not we did not perceive our responsibility as to create for the first time the mission of the church.
[time=2353] It was not for us in the smallness of our own finite minds to determine for God why he had created the church it was rather to look into the word of God and find out what he told us is the mission of the church and to respond to it.
[time=2366] The guys felt very strongly about taking a submissive stance underneath the word of God as the authoritative rule by which we would then move out on behalf of Christ through the church.
[time=2378] That's why it says that to respond to the word of God but then these three statements which we think capture the essence of what the Bible teaches about the church number one exalting the Lord.
[time=2390] That's just another word for worship or celebration and you and I both know John chapter four God is actively seeking people who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[time=2400] The passion of his heart is to redeem people by the blood of Christ create them to be new creatures and then for them sensing what has been done on their behalf the gratitude and the joy to come into a place like this and lift their voices in praise of worship.
[time=2414] He loves that and that is one of the main reasons he brought the church into existence so that he can be worshiped by a redeemed community of believers.
[time=2423] And of course we know that worship doesn't just happen here worship for the believer remember Romans 12 we are living sacrifices all day long in every endeavor of life we are living sacrifices of God holy and acceptable at work at home on the athletic field in recreation wherever we are our life is a living sacrifice to God.
[time=2445] That happens all the time this Sunday morning experience is nothing more than an expression of a life devoted to worship in God this is the corporate celebration time we bring all of our commitment to worship throughout the last six days and it explodes in here on Sunday or ought to.
[time=2464] The second little phrase edify and equip one another those are two different words two different meanings in the Bible edify talks about building another person up it's it's the one and others of the New Testament bear one another's burdens Confess your sins one to another love one another pray for one another on and on and on the list goes it talks about the way that the Christian community comes alongside a hurting believer a sister or a brother in Christ in a difficult time and strengthens them through their own strength to the power of God.
[time=2493] Building one another up helping us stay faithful to what God has called us to do that's edification the next word is equipping and also the New Testament word that is much different.
[time=2506] And it could be substituted for the word training it is it is this idea where the believers train one another how to use their spiritual gifts I mentioned one already this morning Christianity 101 is a really a training session in the fundamentals of the faith.
[time=2522] We go from there to potentially teacher training and some of us are gifted by the spirit of God to teach and administer the word of God through communicating that but that takes some training and some help and so there are teacher training programs in our children's division it happens all the time we train people how to teach children.
[time=2540] Understand the difference you need to learn how to evangelize we want to train you how to use who you are and what you are and what God has done in your life how to be an effective evangelist that's training.
[time=2552] We're committed to both of those we want our church to be a place of great edification and great healing and great comfort and great support and we want it to be an equipping training center that makes us effective in accomplishing what God would have us do.
[time=2567] The last word or little phrases to evangelize our world to evangelize of course to bring people to Christ and the emphasis was on our world because we don't want it to be a desensitized impersonal thing it's it's the commission that God has given us Matthew 28 the great commission go into all the nations of the world it's our world it's been given to us by the authority of Jesus Christ we can go anywhere in the world and we are operating within the authority of Christ.
[time=2596] We also like the word hour because we want it to refer to our next door neighbor and our fellow at work and for some of us our family members so it's a very personalized commission to reach people for the gospel.
[time=2611] That's our little statement that's our mission statement that's why we believe blackhawk exists our mission is to respond to the word of God by exalting the Lord edifying and equipping one another and evangelizing our world.
[time=2627] The next step however you can't just stop with the mission statement because the mission statement is a little too broad a mission statement needs to have now be complemented by what they call a vision statement let me try to make this very clear for you over here we're going to talk about a mission statement.
[time=2646] You just read ours we could give our mission statement almost any other evangelical church in the world and they'd accept that and say yeah we could use this as ours because we want to exalt we want to edify equipping we want to evangelize it's a broad statement of ministry priorities.
[time=2661] Over here is a thing called vision vision is peculiar to who we are as blackhawk vision is the way we're going to flesh out that mission statement in a way that only blackhawk can do it because of our location and our years of ministry and our facilities and our people and our heart and our unique time in history.
[time=2681] This is going to be our vision that is uniquely us it couldn't be given to somebody else because they don't have our place they don't have our people they don't have what we they aren't us.
[time=2690] A vision is a unique expression of just what we are in each of those categories we're going to we're going to exalt God uniquely as blackhawk can only exalt God because of our gifts and our talents and our people in our place.
[time=2702] We want to edify and equip people uniquely as only blackhawk can equip people because of the resources God has given us.
[time=2710] This isn't a better than they this is just us it's unique it's specific so we can't stop and we have felt convicted in our hearts as a leadership team we can't stop with a mission statement see we're not done yet that we've written the mission statement you hold in your hand.
[time=2724] We're not done with our leadership for this period of time until we have articulated very specifically our vision of accomplishing that mission.
[time=2733] Well we started with ourselves we thought that would be a good place to start before we ask you and involve you in a vision of any kind we thought better we start within our own hearts in our own minds as a leadership team and we looked at ourselves.
[time=2748] In light of the word of God and we found a concern and you've heard me say this before when I was out at Grace Community Church I was at one of the largest churches in America had a long tradition a wonderful teacher of God's word a mature family that were 50 elders on this board very mature man that's kind of been the standard for me that's what I got exposed to I come here.
[time=2769] I meet our elder board and over the last two and a half years get to know these individuals and hear their hearts and see their lives and I can say without any hesitation that we have nothing to apologize by way of the quality and the standard and the commitment and the level of excellence that we have found in our elders.
[time=2788] This church has produced some godly men and I know there are many of you who right now have been elders and are holding that title and you fit in that category of spiritual leadership even though it's not formally conferred upon you at this moment and we look across the board at our deacons and see this next generation oftentimes a little bit younger men coming and we look below them and we see men in their 20s and early 30s who are equally as capable and dedicated in their hearts to become the elders of tomorrow.
[time=2817] There was only one problem. We weren't doing anything by way of strategizing how to train the next generation.
[time=2825] We had the guys that we considered godly and ready and capable of training and we had the men who needed to be trained we just had no connection.
[time=2832] We had no way of intentionalizing that process and so we created a little ministry called legacy which I hope the name implies handing the spiritual legacy from this generation to the next and now our elders are coming underneath our ABS.
[time=2845] It's typical now for an elder to be assigned to two ABS and to begin to disciple the deacons and a deacon in training so to speak.
[time=2854] A person who isn't formally in that position now but we're willing to serve that way in the future to meet weekly with them and instruct them in the word of god and to examine the quality of that ABS and see how we can expand its effectiveness and grow its ability to impact people.
[time=2868] That's exciting. The elders are willingly jumping into this saying yes we understand that we want to do that.
[time=2874] It sounds like second Timothy 2, 2, doesn't it? Faithful men and trusting themselves to faithful men who would in turn faithful men.
[time=2883] The problem is we need to finish our vision statement. We need to go farther than where we've gone because a vision statement has to be greater than its leadership it has to encompass all the ministries of the church and all the people of the church and we have a problem.
[time=2898] We don't have enough information. We have certain hunches about our church and the people of our church.
[time=2904] We have certain hunches about where they may be in their spiritual growth and what they may need by way of programming and ministry and involvement but we're reluctant to make decisions based upon our own hunches.
[time=2916] I'm reminded of, that's a dangerous to say even though you may have contact our elders have contact our deacons have contact but I'm reminded of James Dopson who not too long ago conducted a nationwide survey of his radio listening audience around this one question.
[time=2932] What is the number one problem facing you as a parent as you try to parent? You see and he had his hunch. Now here's Mr. Professional Dopson, you know the leading thinker on families.
[time=2942] You think if anybody had a good hunch he would. He receives all this letter, all this mail. He thought that the number one problem was going to be sibling rivalry.
[time=2953] It's quite confident. That was his hunch. He does this nationwide survey and finds out he was completely wrong.
[time=2960] Now I like that in the guy. Fight that he's completely wrong. The number one problem was a lack of assurance in the heart of the parent that their parenting skills were adequate and biblical.
[time=2972] The number one problem wasn't that the kids were fighting. It was the sense of fear and anxiety in their own heart that what they were doing was potentially not right.
[time=2983] We want to learn from people like that. We want to learn from you. And rather than just running ahead on our hunches about our situation, we have designed a survey, a church wide survey.
[time=2996] There are probably 50 questions on this survey and this is my request. I'm asking you to take time out of your very busy schedule and I know we've been desensitized to surveys because we get a lot of them.
[time=3007] And maybe the last thing you want to do is sit down and give us response to the survey and then some of the questions are going to be relatively personal and nature about your prayer life, about your studying the word of God, about your involvement with unbelievers.
[time=3019] Here's the thing I want to tell you. All the surveys are anonymous. We have absolutely no desire to know which survey correlates to which person.
[time=3028] That's not the intent. We're trying to get a broad look at where we are. So you'll never be identified with your survey and we do that on purpose to try to give you the assurance and the comfort zone in which to be really honest with your answers.
[time=3043] We want to bring that survey information back. We want to look at it as a staff. We want to look at it as a leadership team and here's the promise. We will share all the results of the survey with you so that we can do this together so that we can participate in the process.
[time=3060] So sometime in the next six weeks, you're going to receive a survey from our church. It's been reviewed by the elderboard. It's been approved by the elderboard and the senior staff. It's going to examine primarily the areas of edification and equipping.
[time=3075] And our request to you is take time. Fill it out and send it back to us. We're going to provide you an envelope and a stamp. Self-addressed to the church. It's all set up on computer so that we can analyze the data in a relatively expeditious manner and accurate manner and we anticipate and will share our results with you.
[time=3096] Where do we get this idea? You remember in Psalm 23 where it says thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. That comes out of Exodus. What happened is in the shepherd it would come, the sheep would go, it's called going under the rod.
[time=3111] And the shepherd would gather his sheep for the night in a safe place and then when morning came at the little gate, he would take his rod five to six feet tall and lay it at the entrance so that you couldn't get out.
[time=3122] And he'd let one sheep come and then inspect the sheep for insects, a broken leg, malnutrition, eyesores, whatever it would be that could ale the sheep.
[time=3132] And so he would have a personal look and a level of understanding about the condition of his sheep. That's what the elders are asking for. That's what the deacons, that's what the senior staff are asking for.
[time=3141] Give us an opportunity to play our role as shepherd so that we can then work with you to develop ministries and programs and strengthen existing situations so that we can better care for the needs of our church.
[time=3156] Vision is the kind of things that gets people excited, you know that. When you have a clear understanding of your vision and where you're going for the next six years as we bump into a next millennia and we know how we're positioned to do that and we know how we've decided to move about that, then the whole church can begin to join in the process of that and people begin to increase their willingness to be involved and people grow and people change and the dynamic begins, a fresh and a new.
[time=3182] Walt Disney, you may be interested when he wrote out his vision statement long before he'd ever built Disneyland. He had a mental picture of where he wanted to go. That's what a vision is. A vision is a mental picture of a preferred future.
[time=3195] That's what we're trying to cultivate right now as a leadership team and we're asking your help in that process. Listen to the words of Walt. The idea of Disneyland is a simple one.
[time=3205] It will be a place for people to find happiness and knowledge. It will be a place for parents and children to spend pleasant times in one another's company, a place for teachers and pupils to discover great ways of understanding and education.
[time=3218] Here, the older generation can recapture the nostalgia of days gone by and the younger generation can savor the challenge of the future and if you think about Disneyland, if you've been there, they have these lands, right?
[time=3230] And some lands are taking you back to the old south to recapture the nostalgia of yesterday and then there are other lands tomorrow land that takes you off into the future.
[time=3240] So out of a vision, then came specific implementation and how wonderfully they have implemented the vision. I continue.
[time=3247] Here will be the wonders of nature and man for all to see and understand. Disneyland will be based upon and dedicated to the ideals, the dreams and hard facts that have created America.
[time=3259] And it will be uniquely equipped to dramatize these dreams and facts and send them forth as a source of courage and inspiration to all the world and who dramatizes anything better than Disneyland.
[time=3273] You see, they're trying to build vision in people's hearts. Disneyland will be something of a fair and exhibition, a playground, a community center, a museum of living facts, and a show place of beauty and magic.
[time=3285] It will be filled with the accomplishments, the joys and hopes of the world we live in and it will remind us and show us how to make those wonders part of our own lives.
[time=3294] How did that vision came Disneyland and you see they still hold it because when people come to work for Disneyland every morning they put their little uniform on and they get excited to go out and clean up trash or run a ride or sell people food or sell them whatever they're going to sell them at Disneyland.
[time=3312] You notice across the board there is a sense of excitement and enthusiasm and quality control that is inspired by a vision. It should be nothing less in the church.
[time=3325] It should be nothing less because we're not reflecting on nostalgic events about this particular country where we're reflecting on the nostalgia of a person named Jesus Christ who died and rose again and who doesn't present dreams for the future has answers for the here and the future.
[time=3341] And so our hope, our desire, our longing is to involve you in this process, both in gathering the information and reporting back and we are excited to articulate our vision for the next number of years.
[time=3355] Listen to all of our window homes as we close.
[time=3359] I find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving.
[time=3368] To reach the port of heaven we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it but we must sail and not drift nor lie to you.
[time=3379] That's what I'll put. Would you pray with me?
[time=3398] I will come to the close of another Bible hour presentation and I hope you've enjoyed the music from our sanctuary choir and orchestra and from soloists Read La Favour and Denise Mitchell.
[time=3415] The message was a unique message on the state of the union of Black Aunt Baptist Church from our pastor teacher Russell Moore.
[time=3423] If as a result of today's program you just sense that you need Christ as your Savior and you want to live for him, let's take a moment and just pray this prayer together.
[time=3432] Dear Heavenly Father, I'm thankful for the people that listened in today and those that know that they need for Christ to come into their hearts.
[time=3441] I ask you to forgive them of their sins as they ask for forgiveness and become their Savior today.
[time=3447] In Jesus name I pray, amen. If you prayed that prayer with me today why don't you write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3455] When you write us we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "Lessons on Assurance." It'll help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
