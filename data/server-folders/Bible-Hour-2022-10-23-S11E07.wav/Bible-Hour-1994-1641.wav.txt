[time=0] contentment is in the Greek being able to say I have enough. It's not saying I
[time=9] have everything, it's saying I have enough. It's the absence of or the ability
[time=15] rather to limit oneself in requirements and desires and actions so that you can truly say of yourself I have enough.
[time=30] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we
[time=41] hope you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. When it was the last time you heard someone say they were truly content and satisfied. Not the kind of satisfaction we experience after a good meal when we're stuffed and couldn't possibly choke down even one more bite, but a deep pervasive kind of contentment and satisfaction with life in general. Life can play itself out in a lot of ways we didn't expect or even wanted to. Our contentment and satisfaction only for the exceptional few who luck out in life and get all the breaks. What does the Bible mean when it talks about learning the secret of contentment? We'll stay with us today as Pastor Moore explains how even people who have suffered traumatic setbacks in life can know true and lasting contentment. Our special music today includes celebration
[time=97] and Bob Vanetta.
[time=101] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=114] I live my voice and singing to the Lord. I join creation in it's song. I've learned of
[time=141] unity. The song you give to me. All of your majesty. Your power and glory. Lord, I sing your mighty praise.
[time=160] Don't worry as much as race. I come before you singing. We sing. Praise to you for what you've done.
[time=172] For Jesus Christ is one. I feel the air in music. With music of your praise.
[time=188] Your glory fills my very being more. An energy that brings on great. And so I let you
[time=203] believe. Your worship is my name. I sovereign. I proclaim. In my heart it shall reign.
[time=216] Lord, I sing your mighty praise. Your glory as much as race. I come before you singing. We sing.
[time=230] Praise to you for what you've done. For Jesus Christ is one. I feel the air in music.
[time=241] With music of your praise.

[time=492] [MUSIC]
[time=512] Well, hello there today and we want to welcome you to the Bible Hour. We're thankful that you've joined us.
[time=518] I trust that you're doing well in this winter season. I know the weather has been unseasonably cold and along with it it seems like everybody's getting the flu. I know that my family has had
[time=529] its dosage of it this last week. The three of my daughters all came down heavily with the flu.
[time=535] I got it a little bit myself, then my wife got it. It's an interesting kind of a thing when it seems like everybody in the house has the flu and you're not sure who's supposed to take care of who because everybody's sick. I don't know if you folks have been experiencing any of that but I'm
[time=550] thankful that we've made our way through it and trust that God will give you the grace to do the same.
[time=554] I want to talk to you today about a ministry that is a part of our church. It's called divorce
[time=560] recovery workshops and it's a very effective ministry to help people who have recently gone
[time=566] through a divorce. I shouldn't say recently to mean in the last three or four weeks but in the
[time=572] last year or two folks that are still trying to recover from the trauma and the difficulty of
[time=578] a divorce and you know of course God never intended for people to be divorced and never intended for
[time=585] all the hurt and the pain and the sorrow and the disappointment and the sense of isolation and loneliness to come into their life that results from a divorce and yet even in his word we can find
[time=596] help and strength and encouragement as to how to profitably recover from the pain and the trauma
[time=602] of a divorce and this ministry the divorce recovery workshop is one of the best that I know of to help
[time=608] people work through that. Tom Leach is the man who runs that ministry for us. Tom himself is a strong
[time=616] vibrant Christian man who himself has gone through a divorce and has been through a recovery
[time=622] workshop and he was so helped by it that he started the ministry here in our own church and then
[time=628] Tug Pearson is the man who does much of the teaching in the divorce recovery workshops. He's one of the counselors in our live counseling center and grounded in the word of God and does a wonderful job
[time=640] presenting some of the introductory comments and some of the issues that need to be worked through as you have fight your way in recovery and then there are inside this ministry there are some small groups that form and all of our small groups are led by trained counselors all of them are believers
[time=655] and all of them have also been through a recovery workshop to know how that issue applies in their own life and out of that kind of forum comes a real supportive and encouraging dynamic and
[time=666] we've seen a number of people wonderfully helped through the divorce recovery workshop. In fact though
[time=673] it's not designed for evangelism it's not so much designed to bring people to Christ oftentimes that's what happens because they come to a sense of their own need and they recognize God as a source of strength in that time and how they can come to know God through the person of Jesus Christ. In fact two years ago one of the men who had been divorced and was coming through the
[time=694] workshop accepted Christ at the workshop itself and I've been discipling him for the last two years
[time=700] and my he's been growing and is being strengthened in his work relationship with the Lord and his study of the word and is living a fruitful productive happy encouraged life and so whether it's you who
[time=714] happen to be watching the show today and need this divorce recovery workshop or whether it's a friend
[time=720] that you know of that you care about that might need this kind of help we want to make it available to you. It starts February 11th that's relatively soon that's a Friday night February 11th and
[time=731] we want to encourage you to call the church and find out more about registration there isn't much of a cost I don't think any with it but call us at 493 7400 493 7400 if you call us at that number
[time=745] we'll let you know how you can register how your friend can register and we'd love to minister to you in that way. Well today I'm going to be speaking on contentment and it's a wonderful theme
[time=757] to think about what it would be like to be truly and genuinely content in the Lord and your relationship with the Lord and as you live in society. Paul in this particular passage has come
[time=768] to the place in his life where he has said I have learned the secret of contentment and we're going to talk about that from the Word of God and try to dispel some of the myths that surround contentment
[time=779] and also lay out what contentment actually is and the kind of path that we have to be on
[time=785] to know the kind of contentment that the Lord would have us experience in this day and age and it's difficult isn't it because it seems as if everywhere we look we're seeing advertising or some other dimension of our culture that's telling us that we need something new something extra something
[time=800] better. So I trust as you stay with us and study God's Word with us this morning in the music and also in the preaching of God's Word that you'll be encouraged and your eyes will be open to a new way
[time=811] of looking at things as you grow in your relationship with the Lord. We are so thankful that we have the
[time=818] opportunity to minister to you in the Word of God and you know our whole premise it doesn't come from the wisdom of man. I personally don't think I have any significant insights into life. Instead it's just the opportunity to tell you what God has said in the Word of God and so we'll go back now to the main portion of our service and enjoy what God is doing there.
[time=863] When the mountain is steep, when the body is weary, when we stumble and fall,
[time=885] when the choices are hard, when we're battered and scarred, when we spend our resources,
[time=904] when we've given our all. In Jesus' name, we press on.
[time=922] In Jesus' name, we press on.
[time=933] Dear Lord with the prize, may we find the strength to press on.
[time=959] In Jesus' name, we press on.
[time=982] Dear Lord with the prize, may we find the strength to press on.
[time=1008] We'll find that strength to press on.
[time=1039] Amen, Bob. Thank you. In fact, those words come out of the very epistle we're studying.
[time=1045] The book of Philippians, let me invite you to take your Bible and come to the book of Philippians
[time=1051] and the last chapter there, chapter four, as we're rapidly coming to the end of this book.
[time=1057] I want to focus on a few verses this morning, verses 10, 11, and 12. I'll read them and invite
[time=1063] you to follow along. Philippians 4, 10. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you
[time=1072] have revived your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned before but you lacked opportunity.
[time=1078] Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am.
[time=1084] I know how to get along with humble means and I also know how to live in prosperity.
[time=1090] In any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both
[time=1096] of having abundance and suffering need. It's an interesting concept that really has grabbed my mind
[time=1107] in a way this week that it never had before as I studied this particular text, the idea of contentment to actually be content and to know that somebody on this earth could actually say I
[time=1118] have learned to be content. He went through a process and came out the other end of it and the product
[time=1127] was contentment. And I don't mean by that kind of contentment that you have at the end of a really
[time=1135] good meal when you've just stuffed down the last possible bite that you could get inside your body
[time=1141] to stay there and you push yourself away from it and say I'm done, I'm satisfied I've had enough.
[time=1146] He's talking about a deep pervasive contentedness that runs all the way through his life,
[time=1152] every aspect of his life. I've brought along my control unit to my VCR as a symbol of my struggle
[time=1165] with this issue. You see for me when Heidi and I got married we didn't even have a TV we were just
[time=1172] broke college students then writing the seminary never had a TV. On my birthday a couple years
[time=1178] into our marriage my folks gave us a really nice little TV it was you know didn't even have a control unit but it was color about 14 inch screen TV we loved the thing no VCR finally my brother-in-law
[time=1188] and sister got tired of theirs and it was this I mean they had every reason to get tired of it it was old and it was a clunker it also didn't have a control unit and you had to walk over to push all the buttons on the machine well they gave it down to us and we were thankful so now we could hook that up and we could watch movies and do the kind of things you do with a VCR. We moved to Fort Lane a couple years ago and solar house California got a new house out here we're doing some renovating work and I ended up going into this particular store all the time and they had a section in their store that it wasn't about home renovation it was about electronic stuff they had TVs and stereos and VCRs and I kept my eye well see they were closing this entire section of the store down wiping that part out and so big sale prices and I kind of struck up a relationship with
[time=1231] the guy who was closing it down and eventually I said now that one VCR there how much you're gonna sell that for one thing led to another he got desperate told it to me like at cost this is the
[time=1242] control unit to that VCR best VCR in the world it's a Sony if you could see I wish the cameras could
[time=1250] get close and show it on the screen the thousand little buttons on this VCR this one if you want to go fast forward or fast reverse there's a knob and you just turn the knob so you can go sort of fast or really fast or backwards right away it's of course my friends come over I say hey long break look at my new VCR you're gonna love this VCR and when you go fast forward it stays really clear
[time=1271] on the screen so he turns green with envy and I like that the other thing about this VCR is that
[time=1279] it was stereo and so I could hook it into my stereo which sits right next to my TV and we watched some of the really fun movies or the bay or the football games you want to hear the sound and it just comes right through my stereo other friends come over and say ooh that's a really good sound I say
[time=1295] thank you I know so I'm gigging my VCR see finally I arrive in life best one in the world
[time=1303] have you seen that new commercial about the new VCR that's out
[time=1310] this guy with a british accent comes on and he's standing front this big I think to magnivox big magnivox TV and there's a VCR sitting right below it and he says a lot of people it's a british accent I don't do that very well have trouble programming their VCR your troubles are over he picks up the control unit and talks at it says Thursday January 5th from eight to nine channel four and puts
[time=1330] it down and while he's talking into it it takes his voice transcribes that stuff into instructions a little screen on the controller mine has no screen little screen on the controller reads out the date
[time=1343] the time that he said the channel that he said it's done he puts it down he walks away I'm in trouble
[time=1349] now I didn't have to bring this one I could have brought a lot of things in my life that I get that I
[time=1357] really like and then the new version comes out and suddenly I struggle with content in fact you
[time=1366] know you and I we live in a culture that breeds this stuff we are professionals at breeding disc content as a matter of fact the whole television industry is all about disc content you and I we tend
[time=1377] to think the television is about TV shows and movies and news and sport not so that's not what
[time=1384] television is about television is all about commercials television is really all about commercials and
[time=1390] the only thing the programs do and the sporting events and the news do is make sure that we get there and sit in front of that television so we can see those commercials and if you don't think I'm right just ask yourself this question what happens when a show doesn't get high ratings in other words it doesn't get people to sit down and watch that channel do they get rid of the commercials you bet they don't they get rid of the show the show is expendable the commercials aren't and what a commercials do consistently and regularly they professionally breed disc content
[time=1421] they show you your car they show you your home they show you your VCR they show you your TV they show you your vacation so they say there are better ones much better ones
[time=1432] we live in a culture that has exonerated our personal needs to its number one value
[time=1440] what I need has become the number one value in America somebody says something really rude
[time=1446] against the word of God out of bounds really rude to another person and what do they say please forgive me I violated you no they say this I just felt I really needed to say that to you well like that makes it okay you felt you had a need to say that they get involved in a marriage and the marriage doesn't satisfy their personal needs and so they say I divorce my spouse why well it was all a part of my meeting my needs and me self-actualizing and it wasn't healthy for me to stay in that relationship everything is expendable except not having your own personal needs met
[time=1478] it's difficult to be content in a community in a society in a culture like ours it's very hard it's at least nice to know that somebody on the planet at one time was able to say
[time=1491] I've gone through a process and I have learned what it means to be content the word in the Greek means to say I've had enough I have enough it doesn't mean I have everything
[time=1502] it means I have enough in Webster it says this to limit oneself in requirements desires and actions
[time=1512] thereby being content it's an interesting concept you know do you realize if you're content I mean
[time=1522] if you're really content even though you don't have everything you may as well have everything
[time=1528] right I mean if you're really content even though you don't have everything you may as well because it doesn't matter you're content without it you don't have to have it
[time=1539] well let me raise two questions this morning and try to answer them about contentment
[time=1547] the first is what does it mean to be content what does it really mean to be content secondly where do you
[time=1555] find the strength to live a life of contentedness first question what does it mean to be content let me
[time=1563] let me answer the question by giving three things it doesn't mean three basic misconceptions about contentment the first one is this that people who are truly content are that way because they have
[time=1574] a passionless indifference about life they are a passionless and they are indifferent it reminds me
[time=1582] of an old man that I used to see with my parents when we would drive to our we we had a little cabin up in the mountains and we would go there on the weekends sometimes and and you had to go up this winding road kind of in the middle of nowhere up in this mountainous area and we'd finally get to our cabin but along the way there's little winding Tulane road there was an old dilapidated cabin and they convert it to a gas station there was a couple dilapidated old pumps and everything was dirt there wasn't any cement and sitting on a tree stump outside this little old cabin was a
[time=1610] little old man he was there every time we went by except that dark every time we went by the same
[time=1616] guy sitting on the same stump he was never reading a book he was never talking on the phone he was never talking to anybody he was never doing anything he wasn't even whittling he was just sitting there and you think ah contentment well I don't think so maybe in fact he was mentally incapacitated
[time=1635] which brought him to be in such a spot in Paul's day there were these people called the Stoics and the Stoics really exonerated this misconception about contented this this idea of indifference
[time=1648] they took it to a whole new level they said to be truly content you have to abolish your emotions
[time=1654] and your feelings and your desires you must work them out of your system get completely rid of them be able to say I don't care about everything one of the writers said it this way begin with a cup
[time=1667] or a household utensil if it breaks say I don't care go on to your horse or a pet dog if anything
[time=1674] happens to it say I don't care go on to yourself and if you are hurt or injured in any way say I don't
[time=1682] care and if you go on long enough and try hard enough you will come to a stage when you can watch your nearest and dearest suffer and die and say I don't care that my friends is absolutely contrary
[time=1698] to what the word of God is talking about when it says people can be content but I venture to say
[time=1704] that there are people in this assembly this morning who have been working hard and long at those
[time=1712] three little words I don't care because you've been so hurt and so betrayed and so misled and so
[time=1722] let down so many times by the very people who will do the opposite in your life care and love for you that you're tired of experiencing the pain and the sorrow and the disappointment so you have found
[time=1733] the only way to cope with life is to convince yourself that it just doesn't matter I just don't care
[time=1740] that's not being content if you think about the life of the apostle Paul he cared deeply
[time=1748] he was deeply in touch with his own feelings and his own emotions he says over in 2nd Corinthians
[time=1754] chapter 5 that we who are on this earth groan waiting for our redemption we are burdened by the
[time=1762] experiences of life and 2nd Corinthians 11 he went on to say that he has an addition to all these
[time=1768] external pressures and he had just listed off all the times he'd been beaten and all the times he'd been imprisoned and all the shipwrecks and all the stuff he went through he included those those were the external ones he says in addition to the external ones I have the daily pressure of all the churches on my heart here he is this pioneering missionary who starts all the New Testament churches
[time=1787] we can read about and it's not enough that he got beat up in the process physically it's having started them and leaving their city he carries their spiritual needs with him on a daily basis he's
[time=1798] completely in touch with their needs and their hurts in fact later in that passage he said which one of you sins over which I do not have an intense concern deep profound contact with the hurts and
[time=1809] needs of people and himself he groaned so be away with a misconception about contentment that it can be
[time=1818] found through the process of saying it doesn't matter and I don't care there's a second misconception
[time=1824] that people who are truly content are satisfied with the status quo if you're content
[time=1832] you can say I have enough which must mean whatever the state of affairs are fine with me
[time=1839] and there may be a truth in that as we'll see later in the passage but fundamentally that is not the definition of a Christian and it's most important level the status quo is never good enough what am I talking about Paul says in the book of Romans and many other places that he is wholly
[time=1856] discontented with his spiritual condition he never reached a place of contentment with his spiritual
[time=1862] maturity in the Lord he said in chapter 7 of Romans wretched man that I am who will set me free from
[time=1868] the body of this death he looked at his own life and he saw that he couldn't do what he wanted to do
[time=1874] and the things he hated to do he ended up doing and he just was so frustrated with himself because he wanted to follow good but ended up following evil over and over and over again he longed to be
[time=1884] different he longed to grow he was never satisfied with the spiritual status quo of his life he was always
[time=1891] a mouth content when it came to his own spiritual condition always striving always seeking I got a
[time=1898] letter the other day from a friend from a faraway place in the ministry a good friend friend I really
[time=1906] respect listen to his words as he talks about his own spiritual dissatisfaction here's a guy in the
[time=1912] ministry here's a godly guy leading people talking about the desire to know passion and power which comes
[time=1919] from the holy spirit filled life he says three things three realities would be present in my in my
[time=1926] excuse me three realities would be present in ways I don't experience now he's trying to say if it were different this is what it would look like this is what I'd like this is what I long for this is what I wish I hadn't I don't one I would be driven by a passion for God which would
[time=1940] cause me to hunger for his word and for times of intimate prayer
[time=1947] two I would have a heart of love for others that would cause me to break away from myself centered attitudes and actions I don't love others well and I'm not satisfied with just doing loving things
[time=1959] I want the heart of Christ I need to love my wife more I need to love my children more I need to
[time=1965] love my friends more I need to love my students more three I would see the power of God in my
[time=1973] ministry as God began to change lives not for me for him I want to see things that can only be explained
[time=1979] by the little phrase quote unquote God did that I want to be true I want it to be true of me that my
[time=1985] message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirit's power so that your faith might not rest on men's wisdom but on God's power second
[time=1997] Corinthians two do you hear it a godly man unsatisfied unsatisfied at the core of his being with the
[time=2005] existence and the quality and the and the extent to which he knows God maybe it sounds like I'm being
[time=2013] a little too demanding of God maybe like Job I don't have the right to require any action from God but he has said to take every request to him and if I'm out of line he's going to have to let me know
[time=2025] but I'm drawn to words such as these I will give them a heart to know me that I am the Lord they will be my people and I will be their God for they will return to me with all their heart Jeremiah 24 I will give them singleness of heart and action so that they will always fear me for their own good
[time=2041] and for the good of their children and for those after them Jeremiah 32 I will give you a new heart
[time=2047] and a new spirit in you I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh Ezekiel 36 God can change our hearts and there are his promises you will seek me and find me when
[time=2060] you seek me with all your heart Jeremiah 29 and come near to God and he will come near to you James
[time=2068] 48 I know I know it sounds like I'm asking for instant holiness I'm not I know that in this life I
[time=2078] will continue to struggle in the in between frustration of one created to be like Christ yet waiting for the work to be finished and I know that 10 years from now I may find myself caught in another kind of spiritual trial that's okay it's all a part of growing up but I know what I need now
[time=2096] I know that I'm empty without it so please continue to pray for me as I pray for you
[time=2107] there's a kind of discontentedness my friends that auto mark our lives certainly did the life of Paul
[time=2114] you might be interested to know also that Paul was forever discontented with the spiritual
[time=2120] immaturity and other people he never felt content with the spiritual level at which people
[time=2127] had pursued even the Thessalonians who were known for their love to them he wrote excel still more
[time=2136] let me give you a third misconception about contentment that to be content I have to have everything I want I have to have everything I want then I'll be content I fall into that so often so often
[time=2150] and put it to you this way if the Hollywood stars have any God-given role to play in our society
[time=2159] which is questionable it is to teach us that contentment has nothing to do with having everything you
[time=2167] want they are the living illustrations of this truth that having everything you want does not
[time=2174] produce true genuine contentment why because they have riches they have beauty they are the celebrated
[time=2180] ones they are those invited to the most expensive and uppity parties the cars the homes the extravagant vacations and yet you read their memoirs and memoir after memoir after memoir is filled
[time=2193] with depression alcohol abuse drug addiction broken relationships and loneliness
[time=2206] it's not there contentedness is not found in having everything you want in fact look
[time=2214] verse 12 I know how to get along with humble means that could have been translated poverty I know how to exist in poverty and I also know how to live in prosperity that means the fullness of life all that money could buy in any and every circumstance I've learned the secret of being
[time=2230] filled that's a word to use to fatten animals there's so stuff they can't eat anymore and going
[time=2236] hungry both of having abundance and suffering need you see but he's content in either case
[time=2245] well there's just one phrase I want to draw to your attention as we try to round out our thinking about what contentment actually is having done away with misconceptions look at verse 11 he says for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstance I am it indicates that he's been
[time=2262] involved in a process there have been certain fundamental things that have occurred in his life that have brought him to a place called contentment the process I believe is revealed in this book
[time=2275] when you preach through a book you grab a hold of its predominating themes and you look at how
[time=2281] they relate to each other and if you remind yourself and as we went in chapter 1 it said this
[time=2287] I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and I'll discern it to your remember what that was about that was about fundamental values what the value judgments are made on in our life the process through which he has gone began with a reconstructing of the values in
[time=2302] his life to be that which is truly in accordance with the word of God so that he could say what is truly important to me is what is truly important in the word of God remember chapter 2 he found a new
[time=2314] orientation and he offered us the same chapter 2 verse 3 do nothing from selfishness or empty
[time=2320] conceit but with humility of mind let each of you regard one another as more important than yourself
[time=2326] there is an orientation that is others not only values that change his fundamental view of reality
[time=2332] but then an orientation the way he goes about what he does that says you are more important than I am I promise you this you will never find a selfish person who is content you will never find a
[time=2344] person who is living for themselves and seeking to meet their own needs who is truly content the
[time=2352] contented people in the world are those who are living for others who find their greatest satisfaction
[time=2358] not even in the response of others but in the fact that they are able to act on the others behalf
[time=2364] we found in chapter 3 a motive for life a motive for life verse 8 knowing Christ Jesus my Lord I
[time=2374] count all things to be lost in viewing this surpassing value what is it that gets me out of bed in the
[time=2381] morning what is it that keeps me going during the day what is the passionate plea of my heart and my cry is that I would know Christ Jesus my Lord that's the motive behind everything I do
[time=2392] the commune with him and walk with him and practice his presence on a daily basis
[time=2398] so you see a man going through life learning certain things and praying for it in other people's
[time=2404] lives first of all new values consistent with the word of God secondly a new orientation that makes them focused on other people instead of themselves and thirdly a motive which is so compelling to no Christ to be known by Christ and what happens in chapter 4 you find the happiest man in the world a man who does not know anxiety that was two weeks ago be anxious for nothing and a man who is content
[time=2425] profoundly independently content in his relationship and Christ
[time=2439] so what is contentment contentment is not passionless indifference contentment is not acquiescing to
[time=2451] the status quo contentment is not having everything you want contentment watch this is a byproduct
[time=2463] contentment is a byproduct contentment isn't something you can seek directly contentment
[time=2469] is something that happens to you after you've been seeking something else when you seek biblical
[time=2475] values and you seek to serve other people and you seek to know Christ something happens in your life begin to experience a level of contentment that you've never known before it's like humility you
[time=2486] can't pursue humility you can't say to yourself I'm going to become the most humble person in the world
[time=2492] to say that is to deny the statement how do you get humble you get humbled by looking at God and seeing his holiness and looking at your own sin and seeing your wretchedness and somehow the byproduct when those two things connect by the power of the Holy Spirit is a broken humble person but you can't pursue humility the same is true of contentment it's a byproduct
[time=2517] what's the second question we're seeking to answer how do I find the strength to live this kind of life
[time=2523] look at verse 13 he says I can do all things through him who strengthens me let your eyes bump up a
[time=2532] few lines into chapter excuse me verse 12 and notice he says I have learned the secret of being filled
[time=2538] and going hungry he's he's found a secret he borrows this word out of the pagan religions of
[time=2545] his day these these secrets were the special information that you could only know about a pagan
[time=2551] religion once you had joined the religion once you had completed all the initiation rights and you've
[time=2557] gotten through all the locked doors and you finally found your way into the inner circle then and only then what they tell you the secrets that's what that's the word he's using he's saying I have found a secret I have found the secret to contentment and then he says says what it is in verse 13 that
[time=2576] I can do all things through him who strengthens me see to the world that's foolishness to the world
[time=2586] that kind of statement is to admit our own weakness and religion is for the weak it's not a secret it's
[time=2592] something that confounds them it's something they ridicule us about but in reality it is the secret of life to know that the true and living resurrected Jesus Christ takes residence in the believer through
[time=2605] the Holy Spirit and then infuses his own power into that individual's life so that that person
[time=2611] can live obediently to the cause of Christ and find the strength to realign the values and orientate
[time=2618] towards other and passionately pursue Christ it's a secret and like any secret I think there are levels
[time=2627] of knowing it I can say it you can hear it he knew it and there's a there's a price to be paid for
[time=2639] this my friends and I just want to go with to one closing passage with you before we leave second
[time=2646] Corinthians chapter 12 and this is where everybody wants to get off this is where everybody says I
[time=2652] was with you until we went to this passage okay I was interested in contentment until you brought
[time=2659] this particular topic up now I'm out I'll just go back to struggling in my own way
[time=2673] second Corinthians chapter 12 verse 7 he says because of the surpassing greatness of the
[time=2680] revelations this is Paul speaking and as you know he received a bunch of revelations directly from God out of which he wrote most of the New Testament and that's a pretty heavy thing you could get pretty proud about that you could think you're pretty hot stuff so because verse 7 of the surpassing
[time=2695] greatness of the revelations for this reason to keep me from exalting myself there was given me a thorn in the flesh a messenger of Satan to buffet me to keep me from exalting myself was it a minor thing well I don't think so look at verse 8 concerning this I entreated the Lord
[time=2710] three times that it might depart from me I asked him now this is an apostle who has seen the Lord
[time=2717] Jesus Christ on the road to Damascus this is the very apostle that's writing the book we're reading this is a heavy weight in the spiritual community pleading to his savior three different times
[time=2727] please take this thorn away from me this is the very apostle who could heal people at the drop of a
[time=2734] hat in Acts they brought hankerchiefs of the sick people so he could touch it and they would get healed and this guy is pleading with God take away the thorn take away the thorn take away the thorn
[time=2748] interesting those scriptures doesn't reveal what the thorn was only how he felt about it I don't like it
[time=2758] what was God's response verse 9 and he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for power is perfected in weakness most gladly therefore I would rather boast about my weakness
[time=2770] that the power of Christ may dwell in me therefore I am what
[time=2778] therefore I am well content with weakness with insults with distress with persecutions with difficulty
[time=2787] for Christ's sake for when I am weak then I am strong the secret of the Christian life is allowing
[time=2795] God and cooperating with God in his very unique and specialized process to cooperate through the
[time=2802] difficult parts of your life the pain in your life so that he can draw from you the exclamation
[time=2808] I'm not strong enough I'm weak at the core of what I am I don't have what it takes to live this life
[time=2814] and I must have the power of God I must have the grace of God or when I am weak then I am strong somehow then the spirit of God and dwells that believer with the
[time=2830] power and the strength to move purposely through the distress and the persecution and the difficulties for Christ's sake see that's where we want to get off that's where we want to get off we want to
[time=2843] eliminate the suffering in our life we want to say this pain is not what I need we want to say I'm
[time=2850] going to take a different route I'm not going to live for the benefit of other people because in doing so it tends to increase my sense of loneliness and increase my sense of pain and I don't need that kind of stuff in my life right now and so I reroute myself outside the grace of God and I never come to the place where I can say I'm exhausted in this process and I've exhausted all my natural resources
[time=2873] and I want to give up and then suddenly the grace of God let me read you one more letter as we close
[time=2880] from someone in our congregation you see this not too long ago I sit in awe and wonder as I
[time=2890] experience the grace of God as he breathes life and new into me this letter is kind of the the backside
[time=2896] of that other letter he permeates my inner soul and cleanses the pain and hurt within me
[time=2903] he has led me through the valley of death where I didn't want to live any longer where the pain and hurt was so intense that the pain of death he means physical death felt pleasant and relieving
[time=2916] I tried to end the pain on more than one occasion only to have God intervene and delay I tried to reach him by doing all the things that I was taught to do I prayed I read I meditated
[time=2927] I even begged and pleaded I tried to trust I tried to have faith I tried I tried I tried
[time=2933] exclamation exclamation exclamation only by facing the pain and going towards it that I find my
[time=2943] savior only by allowing the pain to intensify one hundredfold that I first excuse me that I find
[time=2950] trust only by trusting that I find hope and only by hope that I find love not trust in now not hope
[time=2957] in tomorrow and not love external but trust in God's hands and time hope in eternity and love
[time=2965] in and out of my deepest inner soul I had to face the pains of life the disappointments and false
[time=2975] expectations I knew my savior but I had never met my God life is a new full of emotion and growth it's
[time=2985] not easy if anything it's harder because now God is working within me not I working to please God
[time=2993] I now see his love because now I can see within me it is now that God can create a life to glorify him
[time=2999] there's only one way to God and that includes pain the pain that comes from God
[time=3007] removing the sin within us that keeps us from him that process will never end until I'm in his wonderful arms and eternity that's what you call hope it's trust that allows you to go inside and
[time=3019] approach the pain trust that God is in control trust that God will create a new and trust that God
[time=3026] will not fail by trusting and giving within to the deepest hurt that's where you find God love
[time=3034] and experience the true dwelling of the Holy Spirit for me the pain admittedly excuse me for
[time=3042] me the pain was and now he's going to give you some personal insights into his own life some things that have happened for me the pain was admitting my longing for a deeper father's son relationship
[time=3054] admitting I hurt and was angry about the sin of divorce acknowledging the pain of an unwanted
[time=3061] abortion experiencing the disappointment and hurt of single parenting facing the hurt and pain
[time=3069] of a marriage now his second burdened by the trauma of child sexual abuse and most of all working
[time=3077] through the horrors being violently raped and beaten as an adult male I ponder the horrors of my
[time=3088] life and never question why some turned to alcohol drug sexual addictions and even suicide
[time=3094] I know why and have looked to the sauce to ease the pain for a moment and run from it
[time=3100] praise to God for never letting go of me praise to God for intensifying my pain praise to God for
[time=3106] showing me the narrow path praise to God for developing in me a life anew that is growing hinds feet so I can experience the high places and praise to God for loving me
[time=3118] I pray my life will glorify him more consistently as I grow from the inside of I want you to remember in Philippians he didn't say be content
[time=3132] and he didn't say that all of us would be content he said he was content and he said he got to that place having learned it and as we look at
[time=3146] the New Testament in his life we find it included addressing and facing and being real with the issues
[time=3153] in his life I don't know where you are I know that God has a way of bringing into our own lives
[time=3161] that thorn in the flesh doesn't have to be a physical problem it may be a relationship it may be
[time=3167] finances whatever it is but God has a way God knows God pursues and it may not be to the extent that
[time=3176] the letter I just read went through you may never go through that level because that may not be what God would need in your life to produce what he wants the issue isn't well my pain be as bad as
[time=3188] the next the issue is am I dealing with the reality of my life let me offer just one last question
[time=3197] that I want you to answer I've answered the first to you answer the third this little phrase I can
[time=3203] do all things through him who strengthens me take out the word him I can do all things through blank
[time=3210] that strengthens me what do you put in there what are you in the practice of putting in there
[time=3216] is that I can do all things through my personality which strengthens me I can do all things through
[time=3223] the hope that I can save enough money to have a happy retirement which strengthens me
[time=3229] I can do all things through my good health because with health I have everything not true I can do all things through my wife through my husband if you have anything else in there other
[time=3244] than the person of Christ it needs to change let me offer you three little places to look
[time=3254] as you leave today maybe even today maybe even today look inside look inside and look for the
[time=3261] part in your soul that snags in serving others try to find that place in your life where you made a
[time=3268] decision not to be committed to other people in serving them try to find that place where you made that subtle little shift and now you're back to having people meet your needs and then look
[time=3282] around you look around you and find those people who need your help need your touch need your love need
[time=3288] your encouragement and give it to them and then look up look up and say God thank you and find the
[time=3297] things in your life that are really worth thinking him over and maybe those include the pain maybe those include the things you want out of your life the most maybe those are the things that you think you could really be content if I could just get rid of this and maybe that is the very
[time=3312] tool and the very vehicle through which he intends to produce true contentment in you and thank him for it let's pray together Father things are backwards in our lives as we compare them to your word without instruction
[time=3331] without teaching we just subtly seem to find ourselves backwards and the way we want things and the way we view things and the way we reason things seem to be opposite from the way you view and see and reason and we confess it to you we come to your word we say please renew our minds show us again
[time=3348] and again and again the fundamental truths of our Christian faith and thank you for that little
[time=3354] verse that says we have power in Christ and help us to be faithful to walk so that we can find our
[time=3362] weakness so that we can find the ends of our own talents and strengths and abilities and as the apostle Paul come to that place of contentedness and weakness so that the strength of Christ
[time=3373] would be revealed we love you and praise you for you are so good to us
[time=3382] to pray these things in Christ's name
[time=3412] all contentment is truly a wonderful thing and it can be found only in Christ if you'd like to have
[time=3428] a personal relationship with Christ I'd invite you to bow your head even now and pray this prayer with me father I know that I will never be content apart from the empowerment of Christ and I know
[time=3440] that I'm a sinner and I want to be forgiven of my sins and to have this relationship with Christ I accept him into my life and my heart to be my Lord and my Savior and thank you for the forgiveness
[time=3450] in him in Jesus name amen if you've made a decision today we'd love to know the nature of your
[time=3456] decision we'd love to send you some information a little booklet called Lessons on Assurance to help you get started in your Christian walk to receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance
