[time=0] If you have those kinds of thoughts, it's not uncommon.
[time=6] It's not uncommon for the believer from time to time, sometimes regularly, to say to themselves, "Why am I doing this?
[time=12] Why am I giving this money when I'd rather spend it over here, or invest it over here, or use it to take my family and go over there?"
[time=31] Welcome to the Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we
[time=38] hope you'll find to be an encouragement. Thank you for joining us. Have you ever asked yourself, "Why do I give money to the church?" Have you ever looked at your giving record and thought of how those dollars might have provided a wonderful vacation, or maybe a down payment on a new car, or been used to boost
[time=58] your retirement fund? Well, today in our study of Philippians 4, Pastor Russell Moore highlights four very exciting incentives to continue faithfully giving to the work of the Lord. Our special music today will be provided by the brass ensemble and Brian Larson. Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our
[time=85] service.
[time=115] [MUSIC] You have faced some power of evil, and you care for his chandises. So just watch
[time=187] there's driving liars, but can't be done by flesh. For when your strength is weakest,
[time=197] they're all your striving pain. Please end and evil, hold your hand and turn your
[time=206] loss to the end. O God, we'll be tornied. God, we'll be tornied.
[time=224] â™ª Make this promise of a day, show your time of desperation. God, we'll be tornied.
[time=239] God, we'll be tornied. God, we'll be tornied.
[time=252] Break this promise of a day, show your time of desperation. God, we'll be tornied.
[time=282] We're glad you joined us for the Bible hour, and right now I want to take just a moment
[time=297] to tell you about a free gift we'd like to send you away. It's the booklet by Charles Swindall entitled Peace in Spide of Panic. Now, if you've ever found yourself looking for peace in your life and always coming up empty handed, then this little booklet will really shed some light on finding real peace, and we're offering it to you absolutely free. All you need to do is write us here at the Bible hour. Our address to the Bible hour, 7400 East State Street, Fort Wayne, Indiana, 46815. Now, let's return to our service.
[time=347] [MUSIC - 160 seconds]
[time=517] [APPLAUSE]
[time=537] We want to welcome you to the Bible hour today. Thank you for joining us, and we trust that God is alive and active in your life, that you're sensing His presence and His love as you move through the situations in your daily life. I know that's the thrill of my life, to know that I am
[time=552] walking with God and that I'm not alone in all of life's many trials. Today, we're excited that
[time=560] Pete and Carol Coby have had an opportunity to travel out to California to visit his brother Mark,
[time=566] who was right near the epicenter of the earthquake. I think Mark was no more than a mile away from
[time=572] the epicenter, and so Pete and Carol obviously have a concern for he and his family, the opportunity to help put things back together, and then as you know, Carolyn Pete are also going to travel up to
[time=583] Northern California where Pete's father and mother live, and so we're trusting they'll have a tremendous time, and today, Reed LaFavor, who is a member of our choir and our church, will be directing our choir, and we're so thankful for his ministry and his involvement, and we'll be eagerly anticipating the return of Pete and Carol. Pete is such a gifted, wonderful music leader and director, and we're so thankful for his ministry here in our church. We're also excited about
[time=607] the message today and the opportunity to talk to you about reasons to keep giving and incentives
[time=613] to furthering the work of God through your financial support. And the passage we come to, Paul
[time=619] is doing that very thing to some of his dear friends who were at the Church of Philippi. They had given him money, and he was writing them a thank you note, and in the thank you note, he continues to
[time=630] reaffirm to them why it is a good thing for Christians to give to the work of the Lord. And that's a hard
[time=636] thing to remember in our day because there are so many competing voices and competing interests that want to draw our finances and really our hearts into other avenues, and then we cheat ourselves
[time=646] the privilege and the blessing of giving faithfully to the Lord's work. And so I trust that even today,
[time=652] as you hear the message, you'll be encouraged and reaffirmed as you give financially to support the
[time=658] work of the Lord. We also just want you to know that we are praying for all of you. We know that you
[time=664] don't always write letters, but there are times regularly in our week where we'll just ask God to bless all the viewers of our Bible hour to encourage you, to strengthen you, and we trust that you are indeed sensing that strength, that you're feeling encouraged, that you're faithfully pursuing your walk with the Lord. At this time we'll go back now to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=710] You were there with me, walked upon the streets of gold, beside the crystal sea,
[time=720] heard the angels singing. Someone called your name, he turned and saw this young man,
[time=733] and he was smiling as he came. And he said, "Bren, you may not know me now," but then he said, "But wait,
[time=746] you used to teach my Sunday school when I was only eight. Every week you would say a prayer
[time=759] before the class would start. On one day when you said that prayer, I asked Jesus in my heart,
[time=773] "Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am alive, that was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=798] I am so glad you came." Then another man stood before you, said, "Remember the time,
[time=812] a missionary came to your church, and his pictures made you cry. You didn't have much money,
[time=825] but you gave it anyway. Jesus took the gift you gave, and that's why I'm here today.
[time=839] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am alive, that was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=864] I am so glad you came." One by one they came, far as the eye could see. Each life somehow touched
[time=883] by your generosity. Little things you had said and done, sacrifices made. I noticed time
[time=897] you in heaven now broke away. And I know up in heaven you're not supposed to cry,
[time=911] but I am almost sure there were tears in your eyes as Jesus took your hand,
[time=925] and you stood before the Lord. He said, "Fight child, look around you. Great is your reward."
[time=938] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am alive, that was changed.
[time=955] Thank you for giving to the Lord. I am so glad you came. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=980] I am alive, that was changed. Thank you for giving to the Lord.
[time=996] I am so glad you came. I am so glad you came.
[time=1026] Amen. Thank you, Brian. Interestingly, Brian's song is a perfect introduction to the subject we
[time=1044] studied today in Philippians chapter 4. Paul is saying thank you to the Philippians for giving.
[time=1052] And so it really sets our minds and our hearts to the matter of our text today. Paul is writing
[time=1060] really the whole book of Philippians as a thank you note, that was the occasion for which he wrote.
[time=1065] And he finally comes to the subject in chapter 4 verses 10 through 19, and we'll examine that
[time=1071] this morning and find further the incentives to giving. To prepare your mind or thought
[time=1079] process is just a little bit further. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever looked at your giving statement maybe from the church or reviewed your checkbook where maybe you record the checks
[time=1090] that you give when you give to the church or other Christian ministries? And at the end of the year, seeing a grand total there, and ask yourself, "My land, there's a lot of money there."
[time=1101] What were some of the other ways I could have spent that? And maybe in a sense ask yourself,
[time=1107] why do I give to the church? Why do I continue doing this? Have you ever seen a neighbor drive
[time=1115] home in a new car or talk to a friend about some wonderful vacation they're going to take?
[time=1123] Knowing that you're not able to take that kind of vacation, knowing that you're not able to drive that kind of car or live in that kind of house or wear those kinds of clothes and think in
[time=1133] your mind, "How can they do that? And I can't." And realize it's because they're not saved and they
[time=1140] don't give to the church. And so whatever that is, whatever amount of money that is, is spendable
[time=1148] income for them. And you look at your own giving and you say, "If I didn't give what I give, I could
[time=1154] drive a different car. I could live in a different house. I could take one of those kinds of vacations on a regular basis." And begin to question in your own mind why you give as you do. Or heard from
[time=1167] another friend who's involved in an investment of some kind for their future. Maybe it's a real estate thing. Maybe it's a stock opportunity. Who knows what it is, a little business. And you
[time=1177] recognize you can't participate because you don't have the discretionary funds for that.
[time=1181] And once again, they do. And of course they don't give to the church. They're not in the redeemed
[time=1188] community. And again, you say to yourself, "Oh man, maybe I shouldn't give." I mean, what is really
[time=1194] the profit of giving? Why do I do that? And been tempted to reconsider. That is not an uncommon
[time=1201] thought for a believer to have. If you're saying in yourself, "Yes, I've had that." Feel as though you
[time=1207] are in good company. Many believers do. And it's not an infrequent thing because we live in a culture and we live in a society that continues to beckon us to spend more money on different things.
[time=1218] And Paul here really speaks to that issue. This passage is not an injunction to give. This passage
[time=1224] isn't a rebuke for not giving. This isn't saying, "Yodid give more." This passage is going to affirm
[time=1231] why we give. It's a passage that encourages us. And it lists incentives and motivation to just
[time=1238] keep on giving. What you've done is a good thing. And there are four of them. We'll see them here in this text. He wants to reinforce our commitment to give by giving us these basic
[time=1249] four incentives to giving to the cause of Christ. First, let's set the context. Look at verse 10 for a minute. But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your concern for me.
[time=1260] Indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity. You remember Paul is in prison
[time=1266] in Rome. And the Philippians know that. And he is under somewhat of a house to rest. He's in his own apartment and he's chained to a member of the Praetorian Guard. He's waiting trial. He may soon die
[time=1277] for his vibrant faith in Christ. And the Philippians want to help him. So they raised some money and
[time=1283] send it along with a man named the Paphroditus. And they say to a Paphroditus, "When you get there, stay there and minister to Paul. If he needs errands to be run, if he needs some help around the house, if he needs fellowship or encouragement, stay there." Which represented even greater financial burden for this church in Philippi to cover a Paphroditus financial needs both as he stayed in Rome and
[time=1303] those income that he couldn't make because he wasn't in Philippi where he had his job.
[time=1307] You see there the phrase you have at last revived your concern. The word revived is a horticultural
[time=1315] term. And it means to blossom or to bloom, to flower once again. There's been a period of time
[time=1322] since they've given to Paul. In fact, we can reconstruct from other passage. It's been about 10 years since the church at Philippi contributed to the work of Paul. It was 10 years ago when Paul was in Philippi. And when he worked around the rest of Macedonia, that's a region. Philippi is
[time=1338] there. Thessalonica is there. He eventually left Macedonia and went on to Athens and Corinth.
[time=1344] This was on his second missionary journey. And the people of Philippi would support him in those various efforts to those other churches. But that was 10 years ago. And he's saying it's been 10
[time=1356] years, but now your love, though you had concern before, you see that in verse 10. It's not as if I
[time=1362] left your heart. It's not as if you didn't care about me. You were concerned before. You've been concerned the whole time. It's just now you've had opportunity to blossom. Your love has bloomed again in my life. You wanted to before, but you lacked opportunity. We don't know what
[time=1377] caused them to lack opportunity. We do know that Philippi was a very poor church. In fact,
[time=1383] Macedonia in general was not very wealthy. And it may have been that they knew of his needs but
[time=1389] couldn't come up with the resources to help him through that 10-year period of time.
[time=1393] It may have been, on the other hand, that they just couldn't keep up with him. Communication wasn't as effective in those days. And Paul was always on the go. And they may never have been sure where he was or how to reach him with funds. And so they wanted to. And they had money, but they just couldn't get it to him. And in that sense, they may have lacked opportunity.
[time=1412] Or it may have been that they were just dedicating their funds to some other endeavor.
[time=1416] Maybe even their own church, maybe some surrounding churches. And they really didn't have sufficient funds. They had to prioritize what they had. And Paul wasn't on their priority list at that time. And now, finally, as things have cycled, he's back on their priority list and they can support him in his ministry. We don't know for sure. The point is he's saying, "I am so thankful and I rejoice greatly that now at last you've revived your concern for me."
[time=1439] It's not a rebuke. He notes their concern had been ongoing. They had just lacked opportunity.
[time=1444] But then, if you were here last week, you know that verses 11, 12, and 13 are all about contentment.
[time=1450] And he's explained to them that what was good about your gift wasn't what happened to me personally because I'm content in any circumstance that I'm in, whether it's poverty or whether it's prosperity, whether it's being filled or going hungry, having abundance or suffering need.
[time=1465] The exciting thing about your gift isn't that I've received something. And therefore, my circumstances have been alleviated because verse 13, he says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Well, think about it now. From the Philippians point of view, they've scraped and scrimped
[time=1481] to finally get enough money to get it off the Paul. He writes back and says, "Thanks, I'm happy you gave, but keep in mind I didn't need it because I know how to get along in poverty. And I know how to
[time=1492] get along when I'm hungry because I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." And so they may get the impression, "Well, why did we do it? I mean, what's the point? Why did we save?
[time=1504] Why did we give? He didn't need it." And so then he says, in verse 14, "Nevertheless,
[time=1511] do you see it? Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction." And so now,
[time=1517] in verses 15 and 19, he's going to give the four reasons why it was good that they shared with him, even though he had reached a level of contentment in any circumstance that he was in.
[time=1526] So he wants to take the issue far beyond his own personal needs that might have been met by their gift and draw them into significant overarching pervasive spiritual principles
[time=1537] as to why we ought to give even independent of the financial need of the missionary himself.
[time=1542] So that's what he's saying here. And because of that, those principles are applicable to us.
[time=1549] And they help us understand and reaffirm to ourselves why we ought to be in the habit of giving.
[time=1554] Let's look at the first one, verses 15 and 16. He says,
[time=1560] "And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel,
[time=1566] this is 10 years ago when he first came there. After I departed from Macedonia, your region,
[time=1572] went on to Athens and Corinth, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving,
[time=1578] but you alone for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs." The glaring
[time=1586] reality of these verses is caught in the little phrase at the end of verse 15, but you alone.
[time=1592] But you alone. You were the only church supporting me as I ministered at Thessalonica,
[time=1599] and then went beyond Macedonia to Athens and Corinth. As if to say, if you hadn't done it, it wouldn't have got done. As if to highlight the sense of involvement that God wants us to have
[time=1611] in the evangelistic enterprise, you were his unique instrument. You were the only thing we had going
[time=1617] for us. You, the church at Philippi, met the need, and if you hadn't met it, it would have gone unmet.
[time=1623] He's saying to them, "You have participated in what God has been doing in reaching these people
[time=1630] with the gospel." It amazes me now, and this is kind of a curious thought. You recognize,
[time=1637] don't you, that God owns everything. He says in the Old Testament, "All the gold and all the silver," which is a way of saying, "All the wealth in the world is mine." He says, "I not only own a thousand
[time=1647] cattle, I own a cattle on a thousand hills," which is to say, "as many hills as you can dream of,
[time=1654] wherever there is livestock, I own it. I created it, I own it all." Here's the point. God has never been
[time=1662] in financial need for one second of his existence. There has never been a moment when he hasn't had enough money. He owns everything. It just so happens, though, that this phenomenally wealthy God who
[time=1676] owns everything has chosen to sow structure reality in the here and now, the world you and I live in,
[time=1683] the world that they were living in, that in order for the work of the gospel to go forward,
[time=1689] it requires the involvement and the financial participation of believers. Now, that's amazing. He
[time=1695] didn't have to make it that way. He chose to make it that way. He chose to structure the world in
[time=1701] such a way that if the gospel was going to be paid for in its advance to go from one city to the next, it would have to come from the resources of human beings even though he doesn't need their resources.
[time=1713] Now, that's not the only way he's done this. It's not just finances. You remember Romans chapter 10 talking about evangelism? He says, speaking of the unbeliever, "How shall he call on him in whom he
[time=1727] does not believe?" You see an unbeliever can't call on a God in whom he does not believe in, to be saved
[time=1734] as the implication. And then it says this. And how can he believe in him or on him of whom he has never
[time=1743] heard? How can you believe in a God you've never heard of? Well, you can't. Well, if you have never heard of him, then you can't believe in him. And if you can't believe in him, you can't call on him, so you can't get saved, can you? And in the last phrase of that verse says this, "And how shall they
[time=1757] hear without a preacher?" Well, that means me. He means us, the redeemed community that articulates the
[time=1766] gospel of Jesus Christ as we fulfill our ambassadorship. So get the picture. God loves humanity. God
[time=1774] loves individuals who are dying in their sin and destined to hell. He knows the only way to save them is for his only beloved son to die on the cross and suffer the burden of all their sin,
[time=1785] which the son happily does for the glory of the Father. So the plan of salvation is almost
[time=1791] resolved. There's just this one last element that must occur if anyone is to get saved. And it is
[time=1798] totally dependent on human beings to do it. They can't call on a God they don't believe in,
[time=1805] and they can't believe in a God they haven't heard of, and they can't hear of this God unless you tell them. He has put you at the center of his redemptive program in the church age.
[time=1817] That amazes me. We don't deserve such a role. We don't deserve to have a part of any of it. It wasn't our son. We didn't pay for these sins ourselves. We were indeed saved by the grace of God. We didn't
[time=1827] even our own salvation. What business do we have being able to be central and integral and essential
[time=1834] in the redemption of a whole humanity? Nothing but the goodness of God. He longs for you and for me to
[time=1842] feel a genuine legitimate sense of participation in what he is doing on the planet. My youngest
[time=1850] daughter Whitney is four years old and she just I'm happy to say idolizes me. Wherever I go,
[time=1858] whatever I do, she wants to do it. If she hears I'm going to the store, she doesn't even ask. I turn
[time=1866] around. She's got her jacket on and she's standing by the door. If she knows I'm going to go outside
[time=1872] and play with our 85 pound Labrador, she's ready to go and she ventures into this very dangerous arena
[time=1880] because my dog has knocked her over many a time. But that's okay if I can be with dad doing what that is doing, it's worth the risk. This week I'm shaving. She comes in and looks up. She says,
[time=1895] "Dad, I want to shave too." So I pick her up. I push the stuff aside. I set her down. We get that
[time=1905] shaving cream going. She's got it everywhere all over her. She needs a razor. So I give her my toothbrush.
[time=1911] And then we work on her shave, you see? You see that is so natural, isn't it? It is so obviously
[time=1921] patently natural that a child wants to be about the business of the Father. There is something inside
[time=1928] of us that should be beckoning and calling us. Oh God, please let me have a part in what is dearest to your heart. Let me just be near you. Let me just be with you. Let me just be doing what you're doing. And so God creates and structures the world in such a way that though he is independent
[time=1945] and autonomous and can save people by writing it into skies or screaming it from the heavens through angels which he will do in the book of Revelation. But for the here and now he is entirely dependent upon
[time=1956] your witness to the unsafe community or they just will never hear and if they don't hear they won't believe and if they don't believe they won't call and if they don't call they won't get saved.
[time=1965] One of the main incentives to giving my friend is God has opened the door for your involvement with
[time=1973] him in the most important thing going in his life. And when you and I three up our resources and give
[time=1981] to God we are privileged to say I helped God. I helped God. I was a part of that process and that's
[time=1993] what he's saying. You and you alone. You and you alone Philippians were the ones who stood with me
[time=2000] and shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving. You were God's critical instrument. You
[time=2006] were the one that God would have used to save those other people in Thessalonica and to save those other people in Athens and to save the people in Corinth because you were a part of the process.
[time=2015] Sometimes giving to God and being a part of the financial setup is dangerous. What I mean to say
[time=2024] by that is this. I received a phone call last night from a dear friend who is on his way to Russia today and he called out of concern in his heart for he knew it would be a dangerous journey.
[time=2035] And he was asking for prayer support and we will I trust pray for him at the end of our service
[time=2041] because he is taking 87,000 dollars in cash to the Soviet Union today.
[time=2049] In a backpack we've tried all the other ways to send money to the Soviet Union and none of them
[time=2056] are effective and none of them are reliable. Save the hand carried deliverer with his cash.
[time=2061] But it puts the carrier in a very precarious decision or situation because when he arrives in
[time=2067] Moscow he must meet in a back room with two or three customs agents and he must declare his cash.
[time=2074] He must lay it on the table and they must count it and see it with their own eyes. It's a dollar
[time=2082] to 35,000 rubles ratio. If you work it out he has three billion rubles in his backpack
[time=2090] and no one knows except a couple of potentially dishonest
[time=2097] customs agents who themselves are living in a culture that is falling apart materially and all they
[time=2105] would need do is call a friend and say it's the guy with the backpack as he exits the airport we need that bag and they get three billion dollars in their currency. I don't know why God set it up
[time=2117] this way. I don't know why the involvement of cash into a situation where we can give. I imagine
[time=2124] many of the same prayers were lifted up for a path for that as he left Philippi saying to his brother and I have heard this this satchel of gold and silver and maybe some precious jewels that we've saved and we've given the question is will I ever make it to Rome and when I make it to Rome will I find it safely to Paul and once it's in Paul's possession will it stay there for there will be the Praetorian guard who might also take a gander at the wealth that was there as meager as it may have been.
[time=2149] All of this because God is concerned that you and I get to help. All of this because God wants
[time=2156] you and I to have a chance to contribute. All of this because he doesn't want us sitting on the sidelines saying it's all up to God. God will handle everything. I'm saved. I'll just relax and be left
[time=2167] out of the process. He wants our ownership. He wants our contribution. He wants us to receive the joy of all that participation. The second reason, verse 17. It says in verse 17 not that I seek the gift
[time=2184] itself but I seek the prophet which increases to your account. He's saying verse 10 I rejoice in the
[time=2191] Lord greatly. You've revived your concern but I want you to know my joy as we've already mentioned isn't that I seek the gift itself. I'm content. Read verses 11 12 and 13. I was okay. What really
[time=2202] fires me up. What really excites me about your gift is this is the prophet which increases to your
[time=2209] account. You got to see this. In verse 14 the word share is used in my version. Nevertheless you
[time=2215] have done well to share. That was a common ordinary day in the business community for the word partnership.
[time=2222] You have done well to partnership with me in my affliction. He is saying we have opened up a general
[time=2228] partnership in this endeavor. Notice at the end of verse 15 with me in the matter of giving. The word
[time=2236] matter means to open an account. So now he's saying not only is it a general partnership but there's a specific account inside the partnership that has your name on it. You have opened a specific account
[time=2248] also in verse 15 the matter of giving which is to be used as a in those days as a payment or an
[time=2254] installment in the investment program. This initial gift which you have sent to me through a pafforditis both this man and the money he brought is the installment that goes into the account
[time=2266] with your name on it in the general partnership that we have established together you and me Philippians and then he says at the end of verse 15 and receiving giving and receiving that we're receiving is to credit and debit meaning I have given you a receipt for your installment.
[time=2282] It's business terminology from the beginning to the end. It is all about establishing a spiritual partnership but to get it the cookies down on a bottom shelf where the rest of us can understand it he uses business terms common every ordinary partnership terms so we'll think about it in those
[time=2297] terms. Having set the stage for that then in verse 17 he says I don't seek the gift for me
[time=2304] I seek for the profit which increases to your account. Having given having established a partnership
[time=2312] there's an account with your name you've got a certain percentage in this in this venture you've been receded for it now as this partnership does its work and as spiritual blessings are accrued
[time=2323] a certain percentage of those go back into your account you get the blessing you get the profit
[time=2329] spiritually about three and a half years ago Bob Provost called me and said Russell we need to buy
[time=2336] an apartment in Moscow he said it's just impossible there's a certain situation that requires our
[time=2343] buying an apartment and it's going to be three thousand five hundred dollars it's all furnished it's two bedrooms it's in a great location we just need to purchase this because there's a translator that we need to put in this apartment so that he can be available to us when we travel to and fro well the church I was with at that time didn't have three thousand five hundred dollars and couldn't take a special offering and get three thousand five hundred dollars so I called one
[time=2367] of my good friends a Christian brother of mine who is in banking and does relatively well and I said I said Ron you're not going to believe the opportunity we've got we can buy an apartment in
[time=2378] Moscow fully furnished two bedrooms three thousand five hundred dollars I'm in for the first five you
[time=2385] want to match me he says well sure so I call my dad he says sure so I call my other buddy he says sure
[time=2393] I call my brother-in-law sure before you know it we've got our partnership put together and we buy a three thousand five hundred dollar apartment in Moscow not in our name we give it the Bob Bob
[time=2403] gives it to the church in Russia the church in Russia buys it the church owns it over there but you see in the eyes of God I am involved in a partnership with my other buddies Bob and the
[time=2417] church at Russia and this translator named Sergei who when I was there several years ago translated for me speaking to two thousand young people in the Carpathian mountains of Russia and every word I say he translates I was teaching these young people how to evangelize do you know what that means
[time=2434] that means when all those people go evangelize whoever comes to Christ our account goes up but greater things have happened with Sergei since then far greater a team of seminary professors and
[time=2446] pastors from the states came and they gathered three thousand five hundred pastors from all over the former Soviet Union and they were there including guys like MacArthur and this Sarah guy was translating
[time=2457] and translating and translating for seven days straight all about the philosophy of the church and how to preach the word how to win people to Christ and all the rest do you know what is happening
[time=2467] to my spiritual account when that occurs those three thousand five hundred guys go back into their churches and teach their people and it explodes all over Russia and it's like as Brian sang for the glory of God I truly expect to see people I have never met before
[time=2492] come up to me in heaven and in a language I can understand say thank you thank you
[time=2498] now of course we're going to take all of our rewards and we're going to think all of anything
[time=2504] that we might have done because it's all by the grace of God and we're going to throw it back at the feet of Jesus but Paul is trying to say something to you Paul is trying to communicate with you you have the option of taking your hard earned cash and saying no to this and no to that and
[time=2520] no to this all of those which will eventually burn and are temporal and though they are for our enjoyment you may choose to opt out of those and begin to establish some partnerships which will accrue to your spiritual account I believe he wants you thinking about that I believe
[time=2537] he wants you counting on that I believe he wants you recognizing that because you give to this church and other places and when you hear back as to what is happening in those places he wants to reaffirm in your mind yeah and I'm a part of that and I'm getting part of the spiritual profit of that in other words my life is more than my life my life is more than my life my life is where my money
[time=2559] goes as it advances the cause of Christ pretty big incentive it also causes you to want to be careful
[time=2565] where you put your money to invest in places that are truly going to be biblical and sound and evangelical it calls for discernment and giving just for example look back at verse 16 see what he says
[time=2579] there for even in Thessalonica you sent a gift more than once for my needs he's saying you opened
[time=2585] an account with me and part of it was directed at Thessalonica well in Thessalonica when Paul got there a church was born people came to Christ and a church began and it just so happens that this particular church was one of the most evangelistic churches in the New Testament Paul later in a book to the Thessalonians says about them for the word of the Lord has sounded forth from you not only in Macedonia the region of Philippi and and Thessalonica and achea the neighboring region
[time=2612] but also in every place your faith toward God has gone forth so that we have no need to say anything so the Philippians are recognizing that they happen to have been involved in a spiritual
[time=2623] partnership that included the Thessalonians and that was a gold mine spiritually the thing just
[time=2629] exploded the third reason verse 18 he says there but I have received everything in full and have
[time=2641] an abundance I am amply supplied having received from the paphroditus what you have sent a fragrant
[time=2648] aroma an acceptable sacrifice well pleasing to God when you give you have the opportunity of
[time=2660] bringing a smile to the face of God he is of course using Old Testament language a fragrant aroma
[time=2666] and an acceptable sacrifice well pleasing to God it goes all the way back to Genesis chapter 8 and Noah gets off the boat and he's so thankful to be alive and he's so thankful that God spared he and his family in that great flood that he builds an altar and on that altar he offers some animals and he burns those animals and God is seeking to help him understand the value of that sacrifice what does that sacrifice really all about and so he says the smoke of that sacrifice
[time=2692] ascends up into heaven reaches my nostrils and it is to me a sweet smelling aroma just like those
[time=2700] wonderful aromas we smell on Saturday and Sunday afternoons in the summer when your neighbor is barbecue ribs and it wafes over the fence and into your neighbors I mean into your own backyard and you go oh man I haven't seen my neighbor in a long time you know that's what it's he God doesn't
[time=2721] have a nose God is a spirit but he condescends to communicate to us in terminology that makes sense
[time=2730] he says it is as if the burning of that animal finds its way to my nostrils and what happens when
[time=2736] something good comes to your nostrils it's it's enlightening and it's enthralling and it's wonderful and it's satisfying when you give my friend you bring a smile to my face you thrill my heart
[time=2747] you touch me in a meaningful way that's what he's saying and though you and I don't offer animals
[time=2753] anymore and burn them and so even the imagery of the smoke is gone he's saying it's not a check you put in that offering plate it's not just a twenty dollar bill my friend it is something that reaches all the way to my nostrils to my attention it touches my heart and I'm thankful for what you've
[time=2769] done you are worshipping me when you give that's why it's in the worship service there are other ways
[time=2775] to give but not so trying to be biblical we not only sing the praises of God we not only have the
[time=2781] praises of God sung to us we not only study the word of God and praise God in response to the declaration of his truth but a vital part of our worship experience is passing that plate so you
[time=2793] can from your own heart offer up something to please God why it's an incentive he's done so much for
[time=2802] us isn't it wonderful to think as we faithfully give and of course you know he doesn't care how much whatever is in your heart to give it if it's from a pure heart if it's sacrificial if it's for the desire to bring him honor in true worship it does it does you reach the throne room of heaven every time
[time=2820] you give with a pure heart well there's one one last wonderful motive that he wants us to see
[time=2832] and it's this last one the fourth one verse 19 he says am I God shall supply all your needs according
[time=2842] to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus now I want to say right up front this is a tricky thing to understand and I'm not sure I fully understand it myself what do I mean here we're talking about a
[time=2853] group of people who do not have an abundance of this world's goods the Philippines giving out of their poverty second Corinthians chapter a I think verse two says when they amass their little
[time=2865] bundle of gold and silver and they hand it to a paffer ditus many of them who gave that money
[time=2871] are not really certain in their own mind how they're going to cover their own financial needs tomorrow that's a part of sacrificial giving many of them have come to the edge of faith and the edge of trust
[time=2886] and saying I know I can meet next week but what happens if my business doesn't do so good or what happens if this happens or what happens if that happens should I have taken that money and tucked it away in a safe place mindful of 1 Timothy 5 8 if you as a believer fail to provide for your own
[time=2902] household you're worse than an infidel you've denied the faith we understand as believers there's a responsibility to work and work hard and provide for our families and care for the future but giving and giving sacrificially takes us to the edge of irresponsibility it takes us to the
[time=2919] edge of faith and trust and that was the case with many of these Philippian believers knowing that as that money disappeared out of their sight they made within a month or two months say oh my goodness
[time=2930] I can't make it so there is this verse my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches
[time=2939] in glory in Christ now what makes this so tricky this is not some kind of formula that says if you're
[time=2945] in financial trouble you give and God will take care of the rest this is not some type of formula that says you give sacrificially and I guarantee that your standard of living always stays the same or goes up that's not what he's saying remember what a need is according to the scriptures first time of these six with food and clothing we shall be content our needs stop when we have eaten and we are
[time=2967] clothed and it's very difficult for our culture to understand that concept because we are so far
[time=2973] above eating and being clothed and we define needs as my standard of living so it gets confusing
[time=2979] let me share with you though what I think is the heart here that he is offering as an incentive
[time=2985] he is saying that God will not be in your debt God will not be in your debt
[time=2992] God will care for your needs out of his out of the riches of his glory two things can in my
[time=2998] mind as I study this week one both of them examples out of our of my own life which may give a sense
[time=3004] of this I think obviously as many of us when we are just married there isn't a lot of resources
[time=3011] and I was in seminary there beginning a four-year stint in that working at grace community church
[time=3017] making five hundred dollars a month Heidi was finishing her time there at UCLA so she wasn't working
[time=3023] and then by the grace of God we ended up pregnant five weeks into our marriage
[time=3031] and so within a year's time you know we've got a we've got a dependent and we're in the most reasonable apartment we can find the proximity to our church we're working and then but but money
[time=3042] is running out folks we we came into the marriage Heidi had saved four thousand dollars through her
[time=3048] high school and college work she had that as her little nest egg and then she had a car and I had a car and I had some stock that had been given to be my by grandparents when I was 16 years of age
[time=3059] and every single week those resources were just depleting and depleting and depleting until
[time=3065] finally all of them were gone sold the car we had one car and nothing left over this period of time and that's you know education's expensive and you got to get started and that's not an uncommon experience we just felt that in the midst of that we couldn't not give even though the resources
[time=3082] were heading downhill we just knew that somehow we had to be contributing somehow we had to be giving there was no peace in our heart to do anything other and as meager as it was we were at least satisfied in our hearts that we could give something but you know God God did some things
[time=3099] in those four years God did some things in those four years that always reminded us he was watching
[time=3105] us we never went without food and we never went without clothing and there were even times when he
[time=3111] would give us special blessings it was the it was the Sunday before our first anniversary Heidi was in
[time=3119] the nursery there at Grace Community Church you know 10,000 people mulling around on any given Sunday she puts her diaper bag down to work with Randy get her from the the helper there in the
[time=3130] nursery she picks the diaper bag up puts it on her shoulder and heads off we go home and open the diaper bag there's a $20 bill in the diaper bag nobody knew we didn't have any money for our
[time=3143] anniversary dinner nobody knew we were heading downhill like this God knew what I'm trying to say is
[time=3152] when you put yourself when you give like that when you give even though you don't know how you're going to give when you give in such a way that you don't know for sure what tomorrow brings you put yourself in a very unique position to be personally ministered to by God himself I'm convinced
[time=3168] to this day that God put that $20 in that diaper bag through some human instrument
[time=3174] even now as an established couple and since we moved here to Fort Wayne Indiana there was an
[time=3182] opportunity for us to give more than we had anticipated more than we had planned and to do so would have jeopardized that little part of your budget called the contingency part but the opportunity was too ripe and too wonderful and so we prayed about it and we gave that money unexpectedly and prematurely our roof needed to be replaced that happens in Indiana
[time=3203] where we got some help from a really neat guy in this church he got us the lowest possible
[time=3211] prices on the actual material got us the lowest possible prices on the people that were going to do the work they did a phenomenal job everything was wonderful the roof was bigger than they thought and the bid came in actually the cost was eight hundred dollars over we didn't we didn't have it
[time=3228] we didn't know what we're going to do we start thinking well we could sell this and we could sell that or we could do this or we could do that maybe we could alone from well what are we going to do there were some options within three weeks and we don't tell anybody about our problem nobody
[time=3241] knows this we get a check for three hundred dollars the next day we get another check from somebody who
[time=3251] didn't know our problem and by the way had never given to us ever you guessed it five hundred
[time=3259] dollars see God he lives he wants you to understand my God shall supply all your needs was it a
[time=3270] need in the raw sense no we had plenty of food and plenty of clothing and we even had options to pay for that a hundred dollar problem but I believe again with all my heart God is saying I'm involved in your life I care about you I know your needs and when you give sacrificial and you give
[time=3285] at some point that pushes you to the edge you put yourself in a position to receive from God
[time=3291] personally because he's the only guy that knows so in another sense I believe one of the incentives
[time=3299] of giving is you put yourself in a place to be ministered to specifically by God the Father
[time=3305] and it's priceless isn't it what in your world could be more valuable what in your world could be
[time=3313] more exciting than sensing oh my goodness God met that need you can't put a price to that God
[time=3319] why give number one you can help God God has structured this world in such a way that you
[time=3326] get to help him do what he needs to do number two you get to participate in spiritual profit sharing
[time=3332] number three you get to bring a smile to the face of God and and enter the throne room with something
[time=3338] that pleases him and number four you get to experience his personal provision you're a giving
[time=3347] church just like the Philippians this is not a message that is trying to beat you over the head and say give more this is a message it says as with Paul thank you for giving and here are the reasons why here are the reasons why you've done well to share of your financial resources thank you let's
[time=3365] pray together Father thank you for the word thank you for its ability to strike at our hearts and
[time=3373] not just always convict us of our sin though that is a vital role and not just always teach us about
[time=3380] you though that is a vital role but at times even to to encourage us and thank us and help us reaffirm our values as to what is important especially with the use of our money
[time=3416] it's amazing the kind of purpose and meaning that our life can have when we are truly committed to
[time=3427] Christ some of you may want to pray even now to give your life to Christ and have this kind of meaning and purpose in your life pray with me now will you my gracious God and Heavenly Father I
[time=3438] know that I am the sinner that I am in need of your forgiveness that comes only through Christ
[time=3444] I ask him into my heart to be my Savior and my Lord and I want to spend the rest of my life serving you
[time=3450] for your glory and I pray these things in Jesus name amen well if you've made a decision for Christ
