[time=0] You're finally gonna pass them, you're gonna pass them.
[time=2] There are certain points, which when finally you pass them, you can never relive them again.
[time=7] They're gone.
[time=8] It's over.
[time=9] (dramatic music) Welcome to The Bible Hour,
[time=24] an hour of Bible study, music, and fellowship, which we hope you'll find to be an encouragement.
[time=31] Thank you for joining us.
[time=32] The Bible warms about passing a point of no return with the grace of God, and each person's life, God works to reveal the person of Christ, and the need to accept Him as personal Lord and Savior.
[time=46] He may do this once.
[time=47] He may do it daily for 50 years, but there can come a point where this work of the Holy Spirit can be spurned for the last time, after which it is impossible to be saved.
[time=58] Today, Pastor Moore explains how this process works, and calls people who are holding back from making a full commitment to Christ to delay no longer.
[time=67] Our special music today will be provided by the Handbell Choir, and a duet by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe.
[time=77] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.

[time=537] I hope you've already enjoyed the music that has been presented and in a moment we'll go back to our worship service.
[time=543] I'd like to take this opportunity to tell you about some other events that take place at Black Hawk Baptist Church other than on Sunday mornings.
[time=551] Let me tell you about a few.
[time=553] In fact, last month we had a wonderful concert in cooperation with Trinity Communications.
[time=558] First call was here, Michael English, who was the male vocalist of the year and received the Dove Award and Mark Lowry all here on the same evening with a great deal of music, with humor, of inspiration.
[time=570] It was a wonderful time.
[time=572] Now we're going to team up with Trinity Communications again and host as concert on Saturday evening, March 19th.
[time=579] For that concert, we'll have four hymn.
[time=582] We'll have Bruce Carroll and Pam Thumb, a great evening of music on March 19th.
[time=588] If you need more information, let me give you a telephone number and you can call and ask the questions that you might have.
[time=594] The number is area code 219-484-1029.
[time=600] Or you can purchase tickets for this event at any of the Christian bookstores in Fort Wayne.
[time=605] We'd love to have you, and once again, that's on Saturday evening, March 19th.
[time=610] Set that date aside.
[time=612] And then last Sunday evening, I was visiting the Praise Kids Choir.
[time=616] That's grades 4, 5, and 6 of our church.
[time=619] They're getting ready for a special musical on Sunday evening March 20th at 6 p.m.
[time=625] The musical is entitled The Attic.
[time=627] And I wish you could see these kids in action.
[time=629] In fact, I'm going to do just that.
[time=631] I'm going to show part of the rehearsal next Sunday at this point in the Bible Hour.
[time=636] Just to inspire you and get you excited about what young people can do.
[time=640] The musical is entitled The Attic.
[time=642] It'll be presented on Sunday evening March 20th at 6 p.m.
[time=646] right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=649] Come and see this exciting musical.
[time=653] And then we're approaching the Easter season and in commemoration of that great event, the Bible Hour would like to send you a book marker that says he arose on it, has a beautiful cross.

[time=725] Let's go back to the live portion of the service and hear music, and then the message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=732] [MUSIC - 205 seconds]
[time=965] That's beautiful.
[time=967] I've been looking forward to hearing that all the way since first service this morning.
[time=971] Well, let me invite you to take your Bible this morning and come with me to the Old Testament.
[time=976] The Book of Exodus, chapter 7.
[time=979] And as you know, we are not currently in a book study, which is our custom to typically pick a book of the New Testament and go through that passage by passage.
[time=988] We're waiting to start one again.
[time=990] We've just finished the Book of Philippians.
[time=992] And in the interim now, we're just taking some topical messages as the Lord has laid them on our hearts.
[time=997] And this morning, I want to address the issue of passing the point of no return.
[time=1003] Passing the point of no return.
[time=1005] And for most of us, most of our life is a series of repeating events.
[time=1011] We get up, we have something to eat, we go to work, we come home, we have something to eat, and we go to bed, and we go to sleep.
[time=1018] And then it just goes over and over and over and over again like that.
[time=1020] That's the routine of life, that's what life is made of on the whole.
[time=1024] And yet at the same time, while we are moving through this cycle, we are actually passing points of no return.
[time=1032] Points to which we could never return again, even if we wanted to.
[time=1036] Thinking about this, I could never be a child again.
[time=1039] And for many of us who had difficult childhoods, that's not a bad notion.
[time=1043] I had a wonderful childhood and can sometimes think back on the wonder and the fun of it all and wish I could go back.
[time=1049] Just thinking, Don, this week, I'm never going to be able to kiss Heidi again for the very first time, which was a wonderful experience.
[time=1058] And I can tell you exactly where we were and what we were saying and just how it was.
[time=1062] But you see, that's gone forever. I'll never get to marry her again.
[time=1065] That's done and over. I'll never turn 21 again.
[time=1068] We'll never have a first child again in the excitement and the thrill of all that.
[time=1072] Or a second or a third or a fourth or a fifth child for that matter.
[time=1076] And we're not looking for a sixth. You know what I'm saying?
[time=1080] You see, these things are gone. This time is over and you can't go back and do it again.
[time=1086] Once you're past that point, you're past that point.
[time=1090] But I want to talk to you about the point of no return.
[time=1095] The spiritual point of no return.
[time=1098] And I have in my mind an audience. It's a subset of the larger group here today.
[time=1103] You who are sitting on the fence in your relationship with Christ.
[time=1109] You people who know about Christ and you've heard about Christ and you've learned about Christ.
[time=1114] And you believe certain things to be true about Christ.
[time=1118] You who may even come on a regular basis, maybe even have joined our church, maybe even bring your Bible and listen on a regular basis, maybe in a ministry, the choir or Oana or some other ministry of our church.
[time=1133] But you know in your heart you're not saved.
[time=1137] And you know in your heart God knows you're not saved.
[time=1142] And you ponder this reality from time to time.
[time=1145] You think it over, you mold around in your head.
[time=1147] And sometimes you view the pros of this fact that you haven't fully given your life to Christ and it's advantageous to you.
[time=1155] At other times you ponder it and you feel a sense of dread and fear because you really believe at one point you're going to receive Christ.
[time=1162] You know you want to, you know you should.
[time=1164] There's no concern in your mind as to whether or not it's the right decision or the wrong decision.
[time=1168] And you believe inevitably you will come to Christ.
[time=1171] And when you realize you haven't, you become somewhat alarmed by that.
[time=1176] And your greatest fear at this point might be that you would die unexpectedly in a car accident or aneurysm in your brain or a heart attack and you'll just drop dead and you'll never have had the chance to do what you fully intended to do at some point.
[time=1191] My warning to you folks this morning is that there is something in addition to death that you need to be concerned about.
[time=1200] Death is not the only thing that can keep you from eventually coming to Christ.
[time=1206] It is possible while you are still alive, still breathing, talking, functioning, thinking, still in control of all your faculties.
[time=1215] It is possible while you are still alive to pass the spiritual point of no return.
[time=1223] Having learned of Christ and rejected Christ, making it then impossible for you to ever be saved.
[time=1234] Alive, breathing, thinking, aware of Christ, but it is possible to go past a certain point in your life
[time=1242] after which it is now impossible to ever be saved, even though you are still alive.
[time=1249] This morning I want to take you to three different texts to establish this in your mind.
[time=1253] One of them is in the Old Testament, one of them is in the Gospels and one of them is later in the New Testament.
[time=1259] But there is a striking parallel in all of them. They all have the same sequence.
[time=1264] It is the three hours. First there is revelation. God brings revelation and truth about Himself.
[time=1271] Then there is the rejection in the heart of the individual who has received that light, and then there is the resolution or the decree by God whereby salvation is no longer available,
[time=1282] even though the individual is still alive.
[time=1285] In my hope, my prayer for you this week, you subset, you know who you are, you know I am talking to you,
[time=1293] is that somehow by the power of the Spirit of God, you will understand the seriousness of your condition and come to Christ.
[time=1302] The first is Exodus chapter 7, you have turned there. The figure here is Pharaoh.
[time=1305] And those of you who are raised in the church remember, those of you who I am speaking to, have probably heard the story of time or two. He is the great ruler of Egypt.
[time=1313] Israel is held captive in his nation. He is using them for slave labor. They are quite a force.
[time=1318] Two million Israelites locked up in Egypt. God has sent Moses and said, "Let my people go."
[time=1325] To which Pharaoh has responded, "No, I am not going to let your people go." And by the way, I don't even know who your God is.
[time=1332] Well, we come now to a second encounter between Moses and Pharaoh in Exodus 7 verse 8.
[time=1338] Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron saying, "While Pharaoh speaks to you saying, 'Work a miracle,' then you shall say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh,' that it may become a serpent."
[time=1349] So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh and thus they did just as the Lord had commanded and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servant, excuse me, and his servants, and it became a serpent.
[time=1359] Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers and they also the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts.
[time=1370] Now you got to understand Pharaoh is locked in a false religious system and these people he's called to himself, the sorcerers, the wise men, the magicians, they are the representatives of that false religious system.
[time=1383] They carry in their hand not something to help them walk. This staff is not so much because they're crippled. It is a symbol of their religious authority. It is a symbol of their religious power.
[time=1396] As you see there in the narrative, Aaron throws his down and it becomes a serpent or a snake. It is a loose Hebrew word.
[time=1404] This Hebrew word could even be a crocodile there on the edge of the Nile which they would have been very familiar with. Right there in the palace of the king now we've got a crocodile or a big snake moving around.
[time=1415] And so Pharaoh looking for a way out of this and this is a confrontation you understand of two religious systems. And Pharaoh says, "Hey you guys do that same thing." And they do.
[time=1425] The point is dramatically made when Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs in the verse 12. And as you've noticed snakes and crocodiles, they don't eat real fast. They typically swallow their victim alive.
[time=1441] But in this case to make the point and to prove the point, Aaron's staff just swallows all those up, just boom they're gone.
[time=1449] An enormous amount of revelation. An enormous amount of truth. An enormous amount of bringing the issues clearly in the focus so that Pharaoh can be confronted with the reality that he's worshipping the wrong God.
[time=1464] Verse 13, "Yet Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he did not listen to them as the Lord had said."
[time=1471] The word of hardened possibly could have been translated strength and it describes the strengthening of a muscle when you flex your muscle. And what Pharaoh is doing here is he's flexing the muscle of his heart to be able to resist the truth about God.
[time=1486] This is something he's doing against that truth. Well it doesn't stop there.
[time=1491] As you know we're not going to move into the 10 plagues and the first one is against the Nile itself and the Nile River wasn't just a nice place to go and we often find people there as we read the Old Testament.
[time=1503] It was in fact one of their main deities and all the other 80 deities of the false religious system of Egypt found their way in and around and amongst the Nile.
[time=1511] Kingpin if you will of the religious system, they would go there regularly to worship and when they went there they would sing this song to the Nile, "Bringer of food, rich in provision, creator of all good, Lord of majesty, sweet of fragrance."
[time=1527] I mean that's something we could sing to God. "Bringer of food, rich in provision, creator of all good, Lord of majesty." In fact that was their God.
[time=1536] So this is not some peripheral issue. God didn't pick the Nile because boy it's a big river and this would make a big impact on people.
[time=1543] He is directly bringing revelation against the false religious system of Egypt because he's trying to clarify their worshiping the wrong God and he in fact is the true God.
[time=1554] As instructed Moses and Aaron turned the water, verse 20 at the end of the verse all the water that was in the Nile was turned to blood.
[time=1563] Verse 21 of the fish that were in the Nile died and the Nile became foul so that the Egyptians could not drink water from the Nile and the blood was through all the land of Egypt.
[time=1572] In other words wherever the tributaries of the Nile went so did the blood.
[time=1575] Just this massive national miracle, try taking a direct blow at the religious system. Verse 22, "But the magicians of Egypt did the same with their secret arts and Pharaoh's heart was hardened and he did not listen to them as the Lord had said."
[time=1591] And it seems, and you'll see this as we go, that Pharaoh is just looking for any reason to reject.
[time=1597] And so he's, "Well, you know, we didn't live in the courthouse there, I mean his serpent ate our serpents, but we had serpents."
[time=1604] And you know, I mean they turned the whole Nile into blood and it would have been really good if our guys could have just turned it back into water.
[time=1610] I mean that would have been nice. The whole nation could have been spared being very, very thirsty.
[time=1614] What they had to do then was dig around in the sides of the Nile and find unconteminated water still underground.
[time=1620] They did apparently and these magicians could turn the small quantity of water into blood. So that was enough for Pharaoh. He said, "Fine, I'll harden my hearts some more."
[time=1629] Another plague came, the frogs in chapter 8. It was a horrible situation. Now watch, Pharaoh began to bargain with God. Verse 8, "Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, 'And treat the Lord that he removed the frogs from me and from my people.' And I will let the people go that they may sacrifice to the Lord."
[time=1646] Sound familiar? You who are on the fence and your relationship with Christ, when God brings enormous revelation into your life or a calamity of some sort and you know he's pressing on you for a decision of complete commitment and you say to him in a weak moment, "Wow, if you'll just get me through this, I'll reconsider my decision."
[time=1666] Verse 15, "But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them as the Lord had said."
[time=1675] The lice came. There was no one who could handle the lice. It was just unbelievably difficult. Verse 19, "Finally, listen to this now. The revelation is now mounting. It's getting more specific."
[time=1686] Then the magician said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God." Now his own leaders of his own religious system are saying, "We can't keep up. We could do that little thing with the serpent. We could do that thing with the water."
[time=1699] Now, hey, you're past us. We're out of our league. Let me tell you, Pharaoh, you're looking at the hand of God. Verse 19, "But Pharaoh's heart was hardened. He did not listen to them as the Lord had said."
[time=1714] Well, there's another plague. It comes in the form of flies. Look at the end of chapter 8, verse 32, "But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not let the people go."
[time=1727] Then there is the plague of disease, of this horrible disease that would fall on man and beast. And before the thing came, Moses told him. He said, "This stuff will fall on any of our livestock. Only on the Egyptian livestock."
[time=1741] Now, see here again. The revelation is getting more convincing, more direct, more undeniable, if you will.
[time=1749] Look at verse 7, "Then Pharaoh's sent." Chapter 9 verse 7, "And behold, there was not even one of the livestock of Israel dead." In other words, it was just exactly like they said.
[time=1761] They said, "It would only strike our stuff." And it did. None of theirs. But verse 7, "The heart of Pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people go."
[time=1770] Over and over and over again now. You recognize the revelation is coming and it's coming stronger and it's coming clearer and it's coming first from the voice of a foreigner and then from the voice of his own religious leaders.
[time=1782] And then it's coming by his own evidence as he can see the ability of this miraculous God to differentiate between who the plague will impact and who it won't in advance.
[time=1790] I mean, you just can't deny it. You should have fallen on his face and said, "Not only can the people of Israel be let free, but I want to worship you too."
[time=1799] Why would I stay with this ridiculous religious system that you seem to play with? It says, "Putty in your hand. My God is nothing in comparison to this true God."
[time=1810] I mean, why didn't he do that? He just continued to harden his heart against God, but now find the look in chapter 9 verse 12 after a severe plague of boils on man and beast.
[time=1821] You come to the end of it and this time it doesn't say Pharaoh hard in his heart. This time it says verse 12, "And the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart."
[time=1830] And he did not listen to them just as the Lord had spoken to Moses.
[time=1836] Come on over to chapter 10 verse 1, yet another plague. Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that I may perform these signs of mine among them."
[time=1854] After the locusts look at verse 20 of chapter 10, "But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart and he did not let the sons of Israel go."
[time=1863] Again in chapter 10 verse 27, "But the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart and he was not willing to let them go."
[time=1871] My lands. Do you understand what's going on? It's just as we had suggested, there is this sequence, there is revelation.
[time=1882] Marvel is wonderful. Pharaoh had more revelation than any other pagan in the history of that time of the world.
[time=1889] He got more truth than anybody else we know of. Right in his doorstep. Right at his own religious system.
[time=1895] No, I don't believe. No, I don't believe. No, I don't believe. No, I don't believe. Then God said, "You're right, you don't believe. I harden your heart."
[time=1903] Now he couldn't believe. Now he couldn't turn. Now he couldn't oblige. Now he couldn't obey. Now he was hardened by God.
[time=1911] He's still alive but he has passed the point of no return.
[time=1919] God brings revelation about himself and in the life of someone he wants to save.
[time=1924] Some of you here today can identify with the way God does this. Some of you could stand up here on this platform and give testimony to the way that God has brought revelation into your life and kind of an ascending order even as he did with Pharaoh.
[time=1937] You can look back over the many years of your life and you can say, "I remember when I first learned about God at this age and then it became more personal at this age and then there was that event in my life and all there's no question in my mind that was God giving me information about himself, whether from the word or a sermon or a circumstance in your life or a friend or a family member."
[time=1956] So you can see the ascending revelation moving in and through your life and yet today you sit in your chair and you have yet to accept him totally and completely.
[time=1968] And you're thinking the decision ultimately rests with me. As long as I don't have an accident, unexpected death, I can control my destiny. I can still say when I will accept him.
[time=1982] And if Pharaoh were here today, he would say to you, "My friend, think again. Think again because there comes a time when God can step in and confirm you in your disbelief."
[time=1998] If you would now come to Matthew chapter 12, you'll see the same thing happening again, same exact cycle.
[time=2006] When you come to Matthew 12, you're coming to a passage where we get this notion of the unpardonable sin.
[time=2012] And you've heard about this, the unpardonable sin. And people ask, "Is there some one sin that is so bad and so diabolical and so wretched for which I could never be forgiven?"
[time=2023] And the answer is, "No, God forgives all sin. God forgives any sin except there's one sin that he doesn't forgive. What is it?"
[time=2031] Disbelief. Disbelief. Disbelief is a sin. Failure to believe in Christ is sin. The one sin that God does not forgive is disbelief and you'll see it here.
[time=2044] What's the first step in our cycle? Revelation. God reveals Himself. Look at verse 22 of Matthew 12, "Then there was brought to Him, namely Jesus, a demon possessed man who was blind and dumb, and he healed him so that the dumb man spoke and saw."
[time=2059] You say, "That's it. That's all the revelation. These guys got." I mean, that's kind of even stated matter of factly.
[time=2066] Well, that's because it isn't all the revelation that they got. Come back with me just for a minute to Matthew chapter 8. I don't have time this morning to prove this to you, but the whole book of Matthew, these first 12 chapters, is nothing but establishing that Jesus Christ is the true Messiah.
[time=2081] All of His credentials are here. Some of them are the miracles that He did, and so we'll just look at those because that's what He's performing in the life of this individual in Matthew 12.
[time=2091] What kind of miracles had they seen? Matthew 8, verse 2, "He heals a leper," verse 6, "a paralytic," verse 14, "someone with a fever." In verse 24, "He calms the storm of the sea." In verse 28, there are two demon possessed men, and He cast the demons out of them. In chapter 9, verse 2, there's a paralytic who gets healed.
[time=2118] In chapter 9, verse 20, there's a lady who's been imaging for 12 years. She gets healed just because she touches his cloak. She had faith.
[time=2128] Chapter 9, verse 27, "two blind men." And by the way, the ability to heal the blind is a unique distinctive characteristic of the prophecy about the Messiah in the Old Testament.
[time=2138] If He could heal the blind, it was extra evidence that He was truly the Messiah. Verse 32, "a dumb man gets healed." You see, these are the kinds of miracles that these Pharisees had seen that what we're looking at in Matthew 12 is just kind of the final opportunity, the final amount of light, the straw that breaks the camel's back.
[time=2158] Don't go back there yet. Matthew 9.35, it's bigger than the ones you've just seen, and Jesus was going about all the cities in the villages teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
[time=2177] You see, Jesus just traveled in and through the region, and He came into a particular area and He would teach. He would verbally explain to them who He was, who God was, about their sin, repent for the kingdom of heaven as in hand was one of His favorite themes for preaching.
[time=2191] You can read Matthew 5, 6, and 7, and hear some of His preaching, how clear it is. He would go beyond that to proclaim the gospel to them, and then He would validate Himself and His message with miracles after miracle, after He would heal every kind of disease.
[time=2207] Nothing was outside the scope of His power. Nothing, nobody could present any problem that He couldn't solve every kind of disease, and you know His public ministry lasted three years, and some have suggested that He actually wiped out all disease in this part of the world during His ministry.
[time=2225] Just wiped it all out, everybody was good, everybody was healthy because of His power. So now, back to Matthew 12, they had unbelievable light, the teaching of the Lord, the proclamation of the gospel, and miracle after miracle, and now this one in verse 22 to demonstrate beyond any shed of it out that He was the Messiah, and in verse 23, that's exactly what people figured out.
[time=2249] And all the multitude were amazed. That's a powerful word in the Greek. It means they were out of their mind with amazement. I mean, they couldn't keep up with what was going on inside their head as it finally dawned on Him, who this guy was.
[time=2261] The end of verse 23, this man cannot be the son of David, can he? Son of David is an Old Testament phrase referring to the Messiah.
[time=2272] So there's the revelation. God even used the voice of the uneducated multitude to say to the religious leaders, the Pharisees, the obvious conclusion is this man is the son of David.
[time=2289] Now watch the rejection. Verse 24, but the Pharisees heard it, and they said, this man casts out demons only by the Elizabeth, the ruler of the demons.
[time=2300] You see, when you see a supernatural work, when you see supernatural power, you only have two alternatives. It's either of God or it's of Satan.
[time=2308] This one, that's it. It's of God or it's of Satan, and they were absolutely committed, not to saying that it was of God, so they had to pick the other option.
[time=2316] They were backed up in a corner, and they were forced to acknowledge the only other option is this. This man casts out demons only by the Elizabeth, the ruler of the demons, which was an absolutely paposterous absurd notion.
[time=2329] It was ridiculous. And by the way, when people are rejecting the gospel, it is always on ridiculous notions, ridiculous notions.
[time=2341] And I challenge you who are sitting here today, still on the fence in your relationship with Christ, to honestly evaluate the reasons that you have chosen not to come to Christ.
[time=2353] I think you'll find them as ridiculous as this. Look at how the Lord points this out. Verse 25, and knowing their thoughts, he said to them, any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste.
[time=2365] And a city or a house divided against itself shall not stand. If Satan casts out Satan, he's divided against himself.
[time=2375] How shall his kingdom stand? It's just a basic human truism. No kingdom can survive an internal revolution.
[time=2387] No leader tears down what he's building up. It's impossible. It doesn't work. Jesus is saying, you're saying, I'm of Satan. Then why am I casting out demons?
[time=2400] And not just this demon. As you saw, a brief sampling in Matthew 8 through 9 other demons. And those demons would say to Jesus, why are you here? Have you come to torment us before the hour, before the time?
[time=2416] He's saying this ridiculous. I'm not of Satan. Then if I am of Satan, why am I working against Satan? Why am I casting demons out of people?
[time=2426] He says it doesn't work in the kingdom. It doesn't work in a city. Look at the universe 25. A city that's divided against itself can't stand.
[time=2434] And even the smallest structure of social behavior, a house, a home. A home can't stand if it's divided against itself.
[time=2443] He says your reasoning is absolutely absurd. And then he adds another point. It's rebellious. It's rebellious. Look at verse 28.
[time=2453] Having shown that their reasoning was ridiculous, he now shows them that it's rebellious. Verse 28, "But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you."
[time=2464] If I'm not of Satan, then I'm of God. And if I'm of God, the kingdom of God is here. Now the kingdom of God is a phrase that means the rule of God, the authority of God, a kingdom, a king and subjects.
[time=2475] It's time for you to get in line. It's time for you to submit. It's time for you to repent of your self-righteousness and your independence from God and come underneath the kingdom of God.
[time=2485] Those my friends are the two components of all rejection against the revelation of God. It is always absurd. It makes absolutely no sense. And it is always rebellious.
[time=2498] It is always the will of the heart that says, "I refuse to submit to the Lordship of God in my life."
[time=2506] And so again, I ask you to test your rejection even today. And I would venture to say it has these two elements of being ridiculous in nature and rebellious at the core.
[time=2521] Having done this, having taken all the revelation that God had brought into their life, culminating in this last miracle you read in verse 22, and rejecting it and saying that that man is of the devil, which is the strongest way they know to reject it.
[time=2539] They have just passed the point of no return. They have passed the spiritual point of no return. There is no way that they can ever get saved now. Look at verses 31 and 32.
[time=2553] "Therefore, I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven, man, and that's true. But blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven. For whoever shall speak a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him. But whoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him either in this age or in the age to come."
[time=2578] Oh, that's severe, isn't it? They had reached the climax of the ministry of the Holy Spirit in their life. They had received all the light, the Holy Spirit was going to give them, and they said it was satanic. And it's as if God is saying, "That's it. I can't give you any more light."
[time=2596] It's not that they blasphemed. Paul himself was a blasphemer. First Timothy 1, he says, "I was blasphemous." Peter in Mark 14 cursed Christ in public. That's called blasphemy. Both of those people were saved.
[time=2611] God can forgive blasphemy. What he can't forgive, what he won't forgive, is the unbelief expressed in saying that all the revelation that God has given to me leads me to the conclusion that Christ is satanic, that Christ is not for me. And I stand in my rebellion, and I refuse to accept and submit his leadership in my life. That's unforgivable.
[time=2632] Absolutely unforgivable. And what's clear is these men had passed that point and time in their life, and they would never reach that point again. They would never be able to cycle back and have a second chance at that decision.
[time=2647] They would live the rest of their life, confirmed in their disbelief. It shall not be forgiven him either in this age or in the age to come.
[time=2661] One last passage, Hebrews 6. Let's see the same cycle here. "Enormous light, phenomenal light, and rejection."
[time=2679] Now in this passage in Hebrews 6, we get to go behind the scenes. We're invited behind the curtain.
[time=2686] We get to go backstage. We get to go inside the heart and mind of an individual. And we get to see the inner workings of the spiritual world as it interplays on the unredeemed mind and heart.
[time=2697] This is one of the greatest passages describing the pre-salvation ministry of the Holy Spirit in all the Bible.
[time=2704] He's going after these people for the cause of Christ. He's working hard. He's giving them all the information and they reject or they are in danger of rejecting such truth.
[time=2715] Chapter 6 verse 4. "For in the case of those who have been enlightened." They have been enlightened. Now what does that mean? The word is "photizo" in the Greek and it just means to become aware of something or to be instructed in something, to be informed of some information.
[time=2732] In Mark 4, Jesus came to Galilee for the first time and he read them a portion of Scripture out of Isaiah 9, 9, 2, and that Scripture said, "The people who were sitting in darkness saw a great light."
[time=2744] And Jesus was speaking of himself. In other words, everybody who ever saw Christ saw the great light. They gained the information. They were enlightened. They became the command, they came in command of information about who Christ was, who he said he was, and what he could do.
[time=2760] They were enlightened. It doesn't mean they were saved. They had gained intellectual understanding, perception about biblical truth. Everybody who saw Christ wasn't saved. Everybody who saw His miracles didn't get saved. Everybody who heard His teaching didn't get saved, but all of them were enlightened. That's what it means.
[time=2778] And then it goes on to use this interesting word "tasted" and it says they tasted three things, three spiritual realities. The first in verse 4 tasted of the heavenly gift, then in verse 5 tasted the good word of God and the third thing, the powers of the age to come.
[time=2796] So what does that mean? How could you taste of that stuff and not be saved? In fact, what is that stuff? Well, tasting the heavenly gift, I believe that's Christ and the salvation He brings, that's the greatest gift of all, the heavenly gift, the gift of salvation through Christ. They've tasted of that, the good word of God, the Bible, the preaching of the truth, and the powers of the age to come. That's a phrase that talks about miraculous powers.
[time=2822] And these people had no doubt seen some of the apostles working miracles, so they'd actually seen some miraculous work. The emphasis here isn't on trying to understand what those phrases mean. It's what does the word tasted mean.
[time=2835] And I think it's a very carefully chosen word by a brilliant author called God to describe just how close the people came to actually getting saved without fully committing themselves to it, without fully receiving unto themselves salvation.
[time=2851] They sampled it, they tasted it. In John 6 it talks about eating the bread of life and having salvation, eating, consuming, taking it into yourself. The great prophet Jeremiah in chapter 15, 16 said this, "Thei words were found and I did eat them." I consumed them. I took them into myself and then he went on to live by them. He says, "And thy words became for me a joy and the delight of my heart."
[time=2878] But tasting is coming up and sampling to some degree and experiencing some dimension of it without taking it into yourself, without truly receiving it.
[time=2889] You say, "How could they sample salvation?" Well, because they were in this community of redeemed, they got to see what Christ could do in a person's life. They saw the actual work of salvation in people's lives and the transformation that it worked.
[time=2901] The difference in attitude, perspective, the choices of those people's lives, they got to see that, taste that in the sense. They got to sample or taste the word of God as it would be preached as they would gather.
[time=2914] And that's not unusual for people to sample the word of God. Even Herod is said to have sampled and enjoyed the preaching of John the Baptist. He liked to hear John preach.
[time=2925] He loved it. Even though John at times would convict him of his own sin. And you know a believer, unbelievers who would enjoy listening to a good sermon from time to time, invigorating, stimulating.
[time=2938] Powers of the age to come, as I've noted, they've sampled that because they got to see some of those unique miraculous powers.
[time=2945] So it's a carefully chosen word to describe just how close these people have come to salvation. And then it says partakers in verse four. Notice there about the Holy Spirit, at the end of the verse, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit.
[time=2961] The word partakers is the word medicus and the Greek, and it means association, not possession. Whenever the Bible talks about how the Holy Spirit interacts with a true believer, it's words like possession, indwelt, baptism, ceiling, adoption, never, never this word.
[time=2983] This word is mere association. It can mean sharing common associations or events. It means you went to the same place somebody else did and you were associates by virtue of being at the same event at the same time.
[time=2994] It's called church. All these unbelievers would come and they would watch and they would see and they would be at the same event as the Holy Spirit was there, resident in the heart of the true believers.
[time=3004] So to that degree they had come into association with the Holy Spirit. This is revelation extraordinaire. This is unbelievable, the work of the Holy Spirit to bring these people to the point of salvation.
[time=3017] My seminary professor described it this way. If you'll envision salvation as a great four-lane highway, and of course living in LA at the time we had a lot of those around us, as a major, major freeway, the freeway of salvation.
[time=3031] In order to get on that thing, you have to go up and on ramp. This is the on ramp of salvation. This is what it means to move from an unenlightened pagan state, not knowing of Christ, to come across the on ramp and move up the on ramp and understand salvation, understand the word of God to a degree, understand the miraculous powers that go with it.
[time=3052] Even watch, or being an association of the Holy Spirit, people are all the way up. And in this passage they're in danger now, putting their car in reverse and backing down the on ramp.
[time=3066] And what this text is telling you, if you do that, it's impossible to be saved. It's impossible. Look at verse 6.
[time=3078] You come up the on ramp. You put it in reverse. You back off the on ramp. This is called the falling away, which doesn't mean that they had their salvation and they lost their salvation. The Bible couldn't be any clear about the doctrine of eternal security.
[time=3091] It's impossible to lose your salvation. Read John 10, 27, to 29. Read Romans 8, 35, to 39. It is impossible to truly be saved and to lose your salvation.
[time=3101] These people aren't falling away from salvation. They're falling away from the enlightenment that the Spirit of God had given them. They are short of being on the freeway of salvation. They are still on the on ramp. They put it in reverse and they back away from it.
[time=3113] What happens to them? Verse 6. It is impossible to renew them again to repentance. You say, well, maybe impossible means difficult. Maybe impossible means boy. They'll really have to overcome some stuff to do that. But it's possible.
[time=3130] Well, I don't think so. Three times, three other times, this word impossible in the Greek is used in the book of Hebrews. Once in chapter 6 verse 18, it says this, it is impossible for God to lie.
[time=3142] Do you think that means it's difficult? No, friends, it's impossible for God to lie. God can't lie. It's used in chapter 10 verse 4, impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away the sins of the world.
[time=3155] It's not difficult for that to happen. It's absolutely completely impossible. It's outside the realm of possibility. It's used again in 11-6 without faith. It is impossible to please God.
[time=3167] Works doesn't cut it. Good works don't cut it. All the good works in the world don't cut it. You come to God on faith or you don't come. It's impossible to come to God any other way. That's what he's talking about. That's the strength of this word.
[time=3179] Having fallen away, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance. They have passed or they are in danger of passing the point of no return.
[time=3192] And they're not even dead yet. What he's saying to them is if you make this decision not to come to full commitment to Christ, if you make this decision not to become a Christian, if you continue to banter back and forth in your mind about this decision,
[time=3208] their may come a point when your decision will be taken from you. And you will be in the category described as impossible to renew again to repentance.
[time=3224] So there again you see the cycle, the great revelation of God, enlightened, tasted the heavenly, partakers of the spirit, tasted the good word of God, tasted the powers of the age to come.
[time=3235] Then there is the rejection and we could, if we had time, describe that rejection as it's talked about elsewhere in the book of Hebrews.
[time=3241] Verse 6, they have fallen away. They were shrinking back from Christ. They were falling back into the Judaism system from which they'd repented.
[time=3249] They were going back to the temple and back to the false worship system, believing in their works, believing in their self-righteousness.
[time=3258] Having done that, then the resolution, it is impossible.
[time=3267] There is a warning for you today, you who are here, who are dabbling with the things of Christ, who are thinking about some day getting saved.
[time=3279] Be cautioned not to pass that point. Because if you do, you will live the rest of your life and then you will pass into eternity.
[time=3291] And there will be no forgiveness. There will be no salvation. Let me close with this one last illustration from World War II.
[time=3300] During World War II, an American naval force in the North Atlantic was engaged in heavy battle with enemy ships and submarines on an exceptionally dark night.
[time=3310] Six planes took off from the carrier to search out those targets, but while they were in the air, a total blackout was ordered for the carrier in order to protect it from attack.
[time=3321] Without lights on the carrier's deck, the six planes could not possibly land.
[time=3326] They made a radio request for the lights to be turned on just long enough for them to come in.
[time=3331] But because the entire carrier with its several thousand men, as well as all the other planes and equipment, would have been put in jeopardy, no lights were permitted.
[time=3341] When the six planes ran out of fuel, they had to ditch in the freezing water and all the crew members passed into eternity.
[time=3351] True story. It illustrates it, doesn't it? There comes a time when God turns out the lights and when further opportunity for salvation is forever lost.
[time=3365] That's why the Bible says, "Oh, first of all, again, come now."
[time=3371] Commit to Christ now. Not for fear of an unexpected death, but for fear of a calcified heart.
[time=3380] Or going past the point after which you can never return. Let's pray together.
[time=3408] While we've come to the close of another Bible hour, and I hope you've enjoyed the ministry of music from our sanctuary choir, the handbells and the duet by Denise Mitchell and Kevin Rowe.
[time=3418] The message today was a very important message from our pastor teacher, Russell Moore.
[time=3423] Yes, if as a result of this service, you've made a decision to trust Christ as your Savior, let's take a moment and pray this prayer together.
[time=3431] Dear Heavenly Father, I want to take this moment and thank you for the opportunity that I have to come and talk to you.
[time=3437] I want to come and talk to you in this way. I thank you for dying on the cross for my sins and rising again.
[time=3444] I ask you to forgive me of those sins that I've committed and be my Savior today. In Jesus name I pray. Amen.
[time=3452] If you prayed that prayer with me today, why don't you just take a moment and write us and tell us the nature of your decision.
[time=3458] When you write us, we'll send you a pamphlet entitled "A Lessons on Assurance" to help you get started in your spiritual walk with God.
