[time=0] There is a great chasm, a great gulf that exists between those who are saved and those
[time=9] who are not saved.
[time=11] We've seen that.
[time=14] The question I want to raise an answer today is how can I be sure that I am truly saved?
[time=24] How can I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I am truly saved?
[time=29] How can I know that I am not deceiving myself?
[time=32] I think I am saved, but I am not.
[time=43] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=56] find to be an encouragement.
[time=58] Thank you for joining us.
[time=59] The Bible makes it very clear that true salvation comes through faith in the finished work
[time=65] of Christ on the cross.
[time=67] There's no other way to be saved, but through faith.
[time=70] However, the Bible also makes it very clear that not all faith is saving faith.
[time=76] Not all belief is saving belief.
[time=78] That's why 2 Corinthians 13 5 tells us to test ourselves and to examine ourselves to
[time=84] see if we are truly saved.
[time=87] In the message today, Pastor Russell Moore will give the 5 fundamental questions that compose the test of true saving faith.
[time=95] Our special music today will be provided by Jean and Cindy Cheryl.
[time=101] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=117] We will do what he promised, we will do what he said, no matter what my best to offer.
[time=140] Jesus, where is for you?
[time=147] He cares and darkness around you.
[time=155] He knows of the human.
[time=163] He promised, he never forsaken you.
[time=170] I gave you, trust in you always be there.
[time=178] He will do what he promised.
[time=185] He will do what he said, no matter what my best to offer.
[time=199] Jesus, where is for you?
[time=207] He knows when your heart is breaking.
[time=214] He seems to shield you from sight.
[time=222] Before you go, let's uncover it.
[time=237] He will do what he promised.
[time=243] We will do what he said, no matter what my best to offer.
[time=259] Jesus, where is for you?
[time=269] He cares, I know.
[time=273] He cares, his heart is touched with my grief.
[time=284] And the days are weary, the long nights are weary.
[time=294] I know, as I long, as I long, as I long.
[time=304] Jesus, says, Jesus, says,

[time=581] Tell the bells we'll find in this world, this light, just this world, please, for we are not even blessing the world, be unto the Lord, for we know to be his voice, be his voice, be his voice.
[time=610] Thank you for joining us for the Bible Hour today, and also we're coming into the Easter season, and it's an exciting time for the Christian, but actually even before we get into the celebration of the Lord's resurrection, we really need to think about some of the events that happened prior to his resurrection.
[time=634] And that's what we're going to be having as a Good Friday service on Good Friday from 1215 to 1245 right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=643] We want to have a special time of communion, this will be a candle lit service, and there will be really no preaching, it'll be music, and then the taking of communion as a time to really focus in on the seriousness of the death of Christ before we get to Easter, and I think Easter may even be more meaningful for us because we've done that.
[time=663] I think that's true, I think there's a lot of things that we can learn from the way Jesus handled those last days from, I just think of him standing before a pilot in the world, crucifying him already with their words and their blasphemy and everything that happened that he just had such a quiet spirit about him, because I think he was carrying out the Father's Word.
[time=687] And we want you to know, we'd love to have you join us for that time, even if you're not a member of our church, this time of communion is not going to be just for our members, it's for any believer who wants to take a lunch hour there on Good Friday and think and contemplate the death of Christ and really prepare their heart for the thrill and the joy of the resurrection on Easter morning.
[time=709] I want to just remind you again that we're having the service on Good Friday, that's April 1st at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. Now the service is timed, it's only going to be from 1215 to 1245, so if you have a lunch hour you can still grab a bike to eat and come and worship with us and then get back to your work.
[time=728] Again, on Good Friday, April 1st, from 1215 to 1245, right here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church, the address is 7400 East State, right here in Fort Wayne, so come and join us for that marvelous time of reflection, the sanctuary will be said in such a way that it will be indeed a time of worship of our Lord.
[time=748] And Russell, I'm always excited about Easter because some of the greatest music that's ever been written is about the resurrection.
[time=755] And that is the thing that separates us from everybody else in the whole world, every other religion, their leader is still in the tomb and ours isn't.
[time=765] It's amazing that the power that's there when we all gather together and our services are going to be a little different on that Sunday if anybody wants to come and be a little bit more unique.
[time=777] Well, they're going to be designed for you to bring an unsafe friend and we're telling Pete, as you know, our entire church family. In fact, we're canceling all of our Sunday school classes for adults.
[time=788] The full program will be there for the kids, but we want our people to be free to have a breakfast with an unsafe friend or a lunch after the service with an unsafe friend.
[time=798] And so the whole service is designed to help you bring an unsafe friend to a service that could help bring them to the Lord.
[time=805] And there might be some of you watching today that don't normally attend church. What a wonderful day it would be for you to come to our services.
[time=813] So I want to tell you that we'll have two worship services that will be identical. One is at 915 and the other one is at 1050, 10 minutes before 11 o'clock and they run about an hour and 15 minutes each.
[time=826] So why don't you plan to attend if you've never seen our sanctuary. You've never been in a live service. This would be a great Sunday morning to come and join with us. What a super time.
[time=836] I just want to tell you that we're going to mention that there's a Ray Bolts concert on May 19th sponsored by the Bible hour and in just a few in the coming weeks, we'll be telling you how you can get tickets and how you can join us here at the church for a wonderful concert.
[time=851] So Ray Bolts is a native of Indiana. He always fills up the auditorium when he comes. Very exciting musician and that would be another opportunity for you to come and join with us and be inspired by his music.
[time=864] We're going to go back now to the live portion of our service. I look forward to the message. I hope you'll stay with us as we hear pastor more speak to us.
[time=882] Until we give your first face. Until we met you begin to fill us with your spirit.
[time=903] You are strong with it. Nothing matters. Nothing's changed. Without your holy presence. Our lives would be in vain.
[time=932] All we want to know you. Live our lives to show you. All the love we owe you. We're seekers of your heart.
[time=961] Because your heart was broken. Because you're so lucky.
[time=973] Because you gave so freely. Because of Calvary.
[time=986] We can now be called your own completed creations filled with you alone.
[time=1009] All we want to know you. Live our lives to show you. All the love we owe you. We're seekers of your heart.
[time=1094] We're seekers of your heart.
[time=1106] Thank you, Gene and Cindy and Scott. Beautifully done.
[time=1118] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bible and come to the book of James, James chapter 2.
[time=1130] As it works out, it's almost as if we've been doing a, I mean, I discovered this along with you, a study here on salvation.
[time=1139] Three weeks ago, we talked about passing the point of no return and the notion that a person while still alive can come to a place where they have rejected Christ for the last time and they've received all the revelation that God is going to give them and they reject Christ and even though they live after that point, there is no possibility for salvation for them.
[time=1162] And it was a message of great warning to you who are sitting on the fence. Thinking in your mind, one of these days, I'm going to accept Christ and you felt your only concern was that death would preempt your decision.
[time=1179] But a careful examination of Scripture shows that it's not just death you need to worry about. There is a point of no return where God says enough is enough. I've given you all the light I'm going to give you and you've rejected me for the last time and he confirms us in our disbelief.
[time=1196] And as the text we read said, it is from that point on impossible to renew them to repentance again. And from that rather ominous study, we went the next week to the wonderfully encouraging and heartlifting study of eternal security.
[time=1215] The fact that another point of no return, once we are truly saved, once we're born again, there's nothing that can undo that. There is nothing in the powers of all the universe and all the demonic hosts, God Himself, Christ Himself, even our own choices cannot undo the reality that once we are truly saved, we can never be unsaved.
[time=1241] And we recognize there is this huge chasm, this gulf that separates those who are saved from those who are not saved. And their life as they live it in the here and now is separated in a huge way because one group lives without the love of God and one group lives in the love of God.
[time=1260] After a physical death, the gap seems to exponentially explode in opposite directions and some people live in the presence of Christ and God and enjoy the splendor of His wonder, all of eternity and others are separated from whatever and ever.
[time=1274] And so there is this one last message, I feel like I need to give. And it's addressed at this question, how, I mean if the gap is so huge and if the price is so high, depending upon which side of this thing I'm on, how can I know that I'm truly saved?
[time=1297] The first message was to those of you who knew you weren't saved, you knew you weren't committed to Christ. It was just a matter of when you might make that decision.
[time=1306] This message is directed to everyone who says they're saved, everyone who thinks they're saved. This message is designed to help you really determine whether or not you're truly saved.
[time=1320] To remove any possibility that you might be deceiving yourself, you see the worst possible condition that a person could be and is to think they're saved and not truly be saved.
[time=1331] They're drowning and don't know they need a life preserver.
[time=1337] So the question is how can I know if I am truly saved? And I need to tell you in advance we're going to jump to about four different scriptures here and kind of the introduction of our message and then we're going to settle in the book of first John and we'll stay there the rest of the time.
[time=1350] But so you don't get irritated with me because I'm going to ask you to go here and go here and go here. I'll just tell you in advance I'm going to ask you to go here and here and here and here.
[time=1358] We're right now in James 2 and what I need to establish in your mind to begin this message is this not all belief is saving belief. You see we have been trained and it is true that you can only be saved by faith, right?
[time=1372] That's what the Bible teaches and that is true. But not all faith is saving faith. That's what this message is directed at. Let me first establish that premise in your mind.
[time=1382] John, excuse me, James 2 verse 18 and 19 but someone may well say you have faith and I have works. Show me your faith without the works and I will show you my faith by my works now verse 19.
[time=1398] You believe that God is one. You do well. The demons also believe and shudder. The argument that this man is making and I won't develop this particular text too much this morning but you'll understand it as we go is that it's not enough to say you believe.
[time=1416] It's not even enough to say you believe that God is one which is essential characteristic of one of his attributes. It's important to God that you understand that he is one is three and he is one.
[time=1428] It's not enough that you believe in God and even believe rightly about God because as he notes even the demons believe that.
[time=1439] The obvious implication is that the demons aren't going to heaven. Hell was prepared for that Satan and his demons.
[time=1448] Come now to John, Gospel of John, John chapter 8 and see this in the human dimension. We've looked at it with demons, demons believe believe that God is one. They're not going to heaven. What about humans?
[time=1462] And here the belief is even more specific, not just in God, that God is one but in Jesus Christ. Jesus has been ministering. He has been doing miracles. He has been teaching. And finally John 8.30 as he spoke these things many came to believe in him. Obviously the him is Jesus.
[time=1483] John 8.31, Jesus therefore was saying to those Jews who had believed him, "If you abide in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."
[time=1499] The essential characteristic of a believer is that they know the truth. The truth about God, about Christ, about themselves. They have embraced their need of that Savior and in Christ they have been set free from the power of death and power of sin.
[time=1512] That's the fundamental reality of being a Christian. So here they are in verse 30 having said to believe in him. Then to add emphasis they say it again, verse 31. Jesus therefore was saying to those Jews who had believed in him.
[time=1527] And now he begins to help them with their understanding of their belief. Was it a saving belief? Was it a belief that would set them free?
[time=1535] Verse 31, "If you abide in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine." What does it mean to abide? It means to stay within the confines of. It means to nurture yourself in. It means to attach yourself completely to the word of God.
[time=1551] If you abide in my word, then you are truly disciples of mine.
[time=1556] Let's go on with it just a minute. Verse 33, "They answered him, 'We are Abraham's offspring, and have never yet been enslaved to anyone.'"
[time=1567] How is it that you say, "You shall become free.'" Verse 34, "Jesus answered them, truly, truly. I say to you, "Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin."
[time=1579] We don't have time to go through the whole passage. The point is this. These particular people go on to say, "We've never been enslaved to sin because we have Abraham." We have a religious system.
[time=1591] And so we don't need to be set free. Why are you telling us we need to be set free?
[time=1597] In essence, they were refusing to abide in the word of Christ and to accept what he said about them as truth. Your sinners, and even though your Israelites, and even though you have Abraham, you need to be profoundly saved from your sin and set free through your faith in me.
[time=1612] So their belief was in him, but it was a different kind of belief. It wasn't a saving faith. You say, "How do you know that?" Look at verse 44.
[time=1622] It's the same group of people. He comes to the end of his discourse with him, and he says, "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father."
[time=1632] He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
[time=1641] That's interesting. Here's a group of people who in verses 30 and 31 are repeatedly said to be believing in Jesus,
[time=1648] but he looks at their heart and says, "You're of your father the devil." You're not going to heaven. You're not saved. Your belief is not a saving belief.
[time=1660] That's why I now come to one other place, a third place, second Corinthians 13. That's why when you read through the New Testament, you keep coming across passages like this one,
[time=1672] which call us to examine ourselves, which call us to test ourselves to see what kind of a belief we actually have.
[time=1683] Is it a saving belief or is it a belief that doesn't save? Second Corinthians 13.5 says, "Test yourselves to see if you are in the faith."
[time=1697] What kind of a faith? Examine yourselves very specifically. Do you not recognize this about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you unless indeed you fail the test?
[time=1711] Wow. What's he saying? He's saying because there are two kinds of belief, one saves and one doesn't.
[time=1721] You need to take the spotlight of God's Word and turn it on your soul. Look inside and discern whether or not Christ is actually living inside of you.
[time=1739] That's the issue of salvation. Christ in you, the hope of glory, is Christ inside of me. So he says, "Test yourselves and examine yourselves."
[time=1751] Well, the test, the best one given in all the New Testament, in my opinion, along these lines is found in 1 John. So now we can finally go to our destination.
[time=1761] If you would, 1 John, chapter 5. And what I want to do is offer you a test. I want to draw five test questions from the book of 1 John.
[time=1773] And I want to invite you to ask each question in the integrity of your heart, "Is this true of me?"
[time=1785] 1 John 5 13 explains why the book of 1 John was written. And it's another one of those passages like 2 Corinthians 13 5.
[time=1793] It says, "These things I have written to you, 1 John 5 13, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life."
[time=1807] Now, you got to think back to your math classes or, I don't know, was it geometry? Where do we learn that stuff about sets and subsets?
[time=1815] There is the set. That's everything. That's everything inside the circle. And then there are subsets. And that's part of the big group, but it's distinguished from other parts inside the big group.
[time=1825] Subset A, subset B. What he's saying here is, look it again, verse 13. "These things I have written to you who believe." That's the whole set. That's everything inside the big circle.
[time=1837] I'm writing this to all people who say they believe. But now he creates a subset. In order that you may know that you have eternal life, some of you do and some of you don't.
[time=1849] The big circle is belief, but not all saving faith, or not all belief is saving belief. And so now I'm going to write this book so that you can discern, yeah, I know I'm in the belief circle, but am I in the part that says, yeah, I have eternal life?
[time=1865] Or am I in the part over here that says, I have really deceived. I just think I have eternal life and I don't.
[time=1871] That's why the book of 1 John was written. And so we'll take a question from each chapter.
[time=1877] We'll lift a question, the central theme of each chapter and a try to apply it to your life. First John 1. First John 1, verse 6. Here comes question 1.
[time=1897] Verse 6. If we say that we have fellowship with him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. What's he saying?
[time=1911] If we say that we have fellowship with him, that's just a way of saying a profession of faith. In our day, in our culture, if we say that we have walked the aisle and that's when we got saved.
[time=1924] If we say that when we were in third grade, we prayed to receive Jesus. And I know I'm saved because I did that in third grade and somebody wrote in my Bible that I'm saved on this and this and date.
[time=1935] Then they put John 10 and no man can pluck the out of my hand. Then they stuck a little star on my forehead and they sent me out of the classroom and said, little Johnny, you're saved.
[time=1945] If that's your profession, whatever your profession of faith is, if you could stand up and say, I believe in God, I believe in Jesus Christ, I believe that He died from my sins, that He rose the third day, He's the only way to salvation. If that's your profession, now look at the verse again.
[time=1960] But if we say that we have fellowship with him and yet we walk in the darkness, we lie. We don't really have fellowship with him.
[time=1972] We aren't really saved. Now this sometimes gets Christians confused, I don't understand why. This is a pretty basic thought. If I say to you that I am a jogger, my profession is, I'm a jogger, I'm a big time jogger.
[time=1987] But you get to know me and suddenly it dawns on you, I never jog. Am I a jogger? Just because I said I was a jogger? Of course not.
[time=1997] If I say to you that I am some big time computer expert and I could do all these crazy things with a computer and then we sit down in front of the computer and you discover, I don't know how to turn the thing on.
[time=2010] Much less do it. I don't try to do it. I don't know how to do it. I've never done it. But I say I'm a computer expert. Am I a computer expert? Of course not.
[time=2020] I try to become a Cub Scout once. And so I got all this little stuff on this patch and I went to my first what a den meeting or other things called. I got in a fight with Steve Limberg. My mom finally came and found me, I had him in the headlock, I was punching his face out, I forget what he did.
[time=2034] I never went back. I'm not too big on memorizing this and doing this little project and doing this little thing. See, I made a profession. I'm a Cub Scout now. I have my uniform on.
[time=2045] But I never, ever, ever, ever, ever went back to a Cub Scout meeting. Never did an assignment. Never completed a project. Whatever they call those things. Am I a Cub Scout? That's what he's trying to say.
[time=2057] You make this big profession of faith. You say I'm a Christian. But we get to know you. You don't live like a Christian. You don't talk like a Christian. You don't give like a Christian. You don't feel like a Christian feels.
[time=2072] There's nothing about your life. Are you a Christian? Because you said you are. You can stay here in 1 John, keep your finger. This is home base. I'm going to go to a couple different passage along the way to strengthen each point as I have opportunity.
[time=2086] I'm going to go right now to Matthew chapter 7. The Lord is speaking about this very issue. He is saying in Matthew 7, not everyone, verse 21, not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2101] But he who does the will of my father who is in heaven. You see, now there's the point. Listen to it again. Not everyone who says to me, Lord, Lord, what's that? That's their profession.
[time=2112] They got the right guy in view. They're calling the right stuff. They're being respectful. Lord, Lord. There's their profession. He says, not everyone who calls me Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven.
[time=2121] But he who does the will of my father who is in heaven. He's saying it's the practice of your life that gives evidence as to whether or not I'm truly your Lord, Lord.
[time=2133] This particular group even had some pretty significant little religious accomplishments. In verse 22, many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name?
[time=2144] And in your name cast out demons. And in your name performed many miracles. In other words, in our day, we would say, Lord, Lord, didn't I join the church? And didn't I give to the church? And didn't I work on the children's division? That's the part about casting out demons. You see the connection there.
[time=2160] You know, didn't I do all these things? But he looks at you, verse 23, and then I will declare to them, I never knew you.
[time=2175] That's John 17 III. This is eternal life that you would know Christ. The definition of knowing salvation is knowing God and God knowing you in an intimate, loving way, not that he doesn't know about you, that he doesn't know you.
[time=2190] You've never joined yourself to him. He isn't in you. So he says, I hear your profession of faith and I recognize your external acts of religion.
[time=2201] But the fact is, my friend, verse 23, I never knew you, depart from me. That's his way of saying, you're going to have a Christless eternity. Then this last telling phrase, you who practice lawlessness.
[time=2216] Wow. There's a pattern of life he's looking for. There's a pattern of life that gives evidence to true saving faith. It's not a profession. It's a practice.
[time=2230] Our assurance comes not on our profession. Our assurance comes on our practice. He does it twice at the end of verse 21, but he who does the will of my father who is in heaven, that's stated positively.
[time=2245] And then he says it negatively at the end of verse 23, who practice lawlessness. Don't be deceived.
[time=2253] That's question one. My friend, if you are sitting here today and you believe that you are saved because you have come forward because you have signed a card because you have prayed a prayer.
[time=2266] But you are not in the practice of Christianity. If you are practicing lawlessness, sin. You have absolutely no basis upon which to believe that you are saved.
[time=2282] Question two. Come from chapter two. Look at verse 15. Now he's going to go inside on us. This last question related to our walk, right?
[time=2295] Here comes the penetrating light of Scripture right into the recesses of our heart. He says in verse 15, "Do not love the world, nor the things in the world.
[time=2306] If anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him." Now you got to focus on that last phrase for a minute. The love of the father is not in him.
[time=2314] It tells us in the book of Romans that when a person truly comes to Christ something happens and it's this, the love of God is shed abroad in their heart.
[time=2323] That always happens to every believer. The minute you come to true saving faith, the love of God is shed abroad in your heart.
[time=2331] So notice again at the end of verse 15, "If the love of the father is not in you, it's revealing that you're not saved." So with that in mind, look at the verse again.
[time=2343] "Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the father is not in him." And he's asking you to look closely at the affections of your heart.
[time=2355] Now keep in mind, friend, that the word of God does not use this word love in a loose way. It's talking about the core commitment of your soul.
[time=2364] It's talking about what you attach yourself to. It's talking about the meaningful commitment in your life.
[time=2371] And what he is saying is, "If the core commitment of your soul is to the world and the things of the world, plants the trees, the sky, the moon, the sun, your house, your car, your bank account, your clothes, your hobbies, if that at the core is what you love."
[time=2395] God is saying the love of God is not in you. Now this is a tough one because the things of the world are very attractive.
[time=2407] And even in our day they are presented to us in very attractive ways.
[time=2414] If you want to hold your place there, come with me to one of the best passages I know to explain the tension in our hearts. First Timothy 6-17.
[time=2426] I mean, in your mind you say, "Well, yeah, I know, but I kind of like my car." It's, "Boy, I really enjoy that jacket that I got that keeps me so warm. It's really neat."
[time=2435] Does that mean I love the world? First Timothy 6-17 instruct those who are rich in this present world not to be conceded or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2449] That's what he's saying. To love the world is to fix your hope on the uncertainty of riches.
[time=2456] You're saying what's going to get me through, what really matters, what gets me up in the morning, the thing I'm living for is the things of this world, my money, my job, my career, the food, all that stuff, that's me. That's what I fixed my hope on.
[time=2474] By the way, don't think when this verse says instruct the rich in this world that they're talking about people who live in a big mansion somewhere in drive a Rolls Royce. He's talking about you. We are the rich of this world. Americans are the rich of this world.
[time=2489] On a comparative standard of living basis, we are the filthy rich of this world. He's talking about us folks.
[time=2498] And what he is saying is instruct yourself not to fix your hope on the uncertainty of riches but wear. Look at in verse 17, "But on God."
[time=2508] The soul must be preeminently in love with God. Attached to God. It goes on in the end of verse 17, "Who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy." And I see there it is.
[time=2522] It's okay to enjoy your house. It's okay to enjoy your car. It's okay to enjoy your hobbies. But you see there's a world of difference between enjoying something and fixing your hope on it.
[time=2535] Being in love with it, living for it, dying for it, letting it be the predominant value by which you make all the other decisions in your life.
[time=2544] Enjoy it. Sure. Love it. No. As you look at your life, which value is it? The Bible says you can't serve God and man and it's one or the other.
[time=2556] Would you have the honesty and the integrity this morning to ask yourself, "What do I really love?"
[time=2562] I know in my life, there are times where I am drawn away to begin to set my affections on the things of the world and to begin to let them try to usurp my love for God.
[time=2575] There are a lot of things sometimes I'd really like and I can confuse myself and tell myself, "If I just had certain things, I'd be a whole lot happier." I'm certainly not immune to that temptation, but I can honestly say to you that when the Spirit of God finally opens my eyes again and convicts me, there is this bottom level, solid, hard rock foundation of love in my heart for God and God alone.
[time=2598] And I know that none of those things can ultimately satisfy me and I know I would never trade him for all the riches in the world and I would never trade his word for the riches of the world and I would never trade trying to live the way he wants me to live for all the riches in the world.
[time=2616] Where are you? Where are you? Back to 1 John. I've got a hurry up here.
[time=2628] This one is really black and white now, this question. 1 John 3 verse 7, "Little children." See what I mean? He's going to put these cookies right down on the bottom shelf.
[time=2642] "Little children, let no one deceive you. The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Christ is righteous."
[time=2654] Verse 8, "The one who practices sin is of the devil. For the devil has sinned from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose that he might destroy the works of the devil."
[time=2666] Verse 9, "Here it is, black and white. No one who is born of God practices sin because his seed abides in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God.
[time=2678] By this, the children of God and the children of the devil are obvious." You say, "Oh, really? Tell me. Anyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor the one who does not love his brother."
[time=2692] You got it? Couldn't be said any clearer. There is a black and white distinction between the saved and the unsaved, the child of God and the child of the devil.
[time=2702] And it is, do they practice righteousness or do they practice unrighteousness? This is not saying that a Christian never sins.
[time=2712] The book of 1 John says, "If we confess our sins, he'll be faithful and just to forgive us. In fact, if we say we have no sin, the truth is not in us."
[time=2720] Part of being a Christian is admitting that you're sinful even after you're saved. The issue is the practice of your life.
[time=2728] Let me put it to you this way. Since you have come to Christ, whenever that was, whenever that profession of faith, since you say you came to Christ, whatever that moment was, has your life become increasingly more Christ-like and devoted to Christ and devoted to the things of the God from your heart?
[time=2748] Yeah, there's sin, but there's an increasing movement towards righteousness or, since that time where you said you were becoming a Christian, has there been an increasing development of sin in your life?
[time=2763] Are you more sinful today than you were then and from your heart?
[time=2769] Black and white, all you have to do is be honest with yourself. All you have to do is really genuinely be honest with yourself and say, "Hey, since that day have I been pursuing more like Christ or less like Christ?"
[time=2782] And if the pattern, though you may have had some dips, is moving more towards Christ, you should have a sense of joy, man. I'm saved. I have assurance there's basis for my conviction that I'm truly saved.
[time=2796] At the same time, if the scope or the slope of your life has been moving downward, you know what? You don't have any reason to have any confidence that you're saved at all. None.
[time=2818] Question number four. Chapter four. Verse seven. He's going to go back inside on us again. Be loving. Let us love one another for love is from God and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
[time=2838] Now watch. Verse eight. The one who does not love does not know God. There it is. He's defining now our love, not just for God as opposed to the things of the world like he did back there in chapter two. He's now saying there must be a consistent evidence of genuine sincere sacrificial love for the brethren, for one another.
[time=2866] You need to be able to look at the landscape of your friendships. And some of your friends are saved and some of your friends are unsaved. And you need to be able to recognize that there is a unique bond in your heart to the believers that you do not have with other people.
[time=2885] Oh, yes, we're called to love the unsaved. We're called to have compassion. There are some unsaved people in my life that I can weep over that I care about that I love to spend time with. But I'll tell you something. There is a there's a world of difference between that affection and the affection I have for the believer.
[time=2902] I can't explain that to you. It's just true. And that's what he's describing.
[time=2909] We remember that love is not an emotion. Love is not simply some feeling of benevolence. We remember that love is a commitment to sacrificial give your life for your brethren.
[time=2921] Is that true of you? As you look at your life, as you examine your relationships, do you sense this unique peculiar strong love for other Christians and with it a willingness to sacrifice for their benefit?
[time=2934] If you do my friend, you have a reason to thank God because it is yet another evidence that you're truly saved. If you don't, there goes another possible leg to hold up your stool.
[time=2950] And here's the best one, question five, chapter five. This is the one that makes all the other ones possible.
[time=2964] First, John 5, 4 for whatever is born of God, overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith. Now watch, it goes in a circle. We're back now to the end of the book and it's our faith that saves us.
[time=2979] We're not saved by works. I know you could maybe pick that up. You're saying, well, I had to work here and I had to work in chapter two and I had to work in chapter three and I had to work in chapter four. Remember now, you come full circle back to the thing which overcomes the world and it's nothing but saving faith.
[time=2993] What is this? True saving faith makes a difference in your life. See? It's true saving faith that makes the difference in your life. Why? Because true saving faith changes who you are.
[time=3008] Don't miss this, please. This is the most important thing we're going to say. When a person truly comes to Christ in saving faith, there is a radical transformation of their inside person.
[time=3022] And they go from a God-hating, rebellious, sinful person to a God-loving, righteous-ness-seeking, brother-compassioned individual. These are the components of the New Covenant and you might take a moment later to read Ezekiel 36 and God promises with Christ and with the day in which we live that he would do some things to the inside of the person in response to true saving faith.
[time=3051] He did not do in the Old Testament. He promised us that he would replace our heart of stone with a heart of flesh. He promised us that he would take away our mind of hostility and give a mind of consistent with the mind of Christ.
[time=3071] And then he did the big one. He said, "And I will put my spirit within you," meaning Christ in you, the hope of glory. That happens when a person truly comes to Christ. Their heart is softened, their mind is softened, their spirit is softened, and then the true and living God in the form of the Holy Spirit takes residence inside the individual and they are profoundly and forever different.
[time=3100] And that is why you can go back and take the other questions in the test and say, "Do I walk in unrighteousness? Do I walk in the darkness?" Well, then of course I'm not saved because a truly changed person can't stand to walk in the darkness.
[time=3116] You can go to the second question and say, "Do I love the things of the world or do I love God?" And if you love the things of the world, you can say, "Of course I'm not saved because a truly changed person who's been born again doesn't love the things of the world." Sure, we can be tempted by them, but that's not the profound commitment of my life.
[time=3136] That's why you can go to question three and say, "Do I practice sin? Am I increasing and growing in my sinfulness?" And the answer, of course not. I hate sin now.
[time=3149] I used to just hate its consequences. I used to just hate getting caught. I used to hate just being found out in my sin, but now that I'm truly saved, I hate the sin itself.
[time=3161] Because I'm different now. I'm born again. That's why you can come to chapter four and look for a genuine love of the brotherhood because it's out of that newness, out of that soft heart that a true love of the brotherhood grows.
[time=3179] Being born again is not some fancy political turn that used to be thrown around in the 70s. Being born again means I'm different forever. Not different because even I decided to be different because God worked the miracle of regeneration in my heart and now I'm wired differently and I got to live consistent with the way I'm wired.
[time=3198] So I can walk through these tests and I can pass each question basically.
[time=3207] I want desperately for you to look in your heart this morning. Be honest with yourself. All you need is the integrity to honestly answer the questions.
[time=3219] Do you walk in the truth? Do you walk your talk? Do you have a deep love of God that surpasses the love of the world?
[time=3230] Do you practice sin or do you practice righteousness? Do you love your brother deeply from your heart?
[time=3240] And when you look inside is Christ there, are you born again? Does the Spirit of God live inside of you? If the answers to those questions are yes, praise God.
[time=3251] Man, it's time to stand up and sing the hallelujah chorus. If the answer to those questions is no, no matter what you said, no matter what you've been told, no matter what commitment you may have made, there is no evidence of true saving faith in your life.
[time=3267] You say, "Okay, so that's me. Okay, I give. What am I supposed to do now?"
[time=3276] Admit it.
[time=3278] Remember John 8, they refused to admit they were slaves to sin. You stand before God and you admit to him, "I am a slave to sin. I am a sinner. I deserve hell.
[time=3287] I know I professed you in the past, but there's no evidence. God, please save my soul.
[time=3294] Please create and me a new heart. Please make me born again." And he'll do it.
[time=3301] But it's got to be a real genuine transaction between you and the person of Jesus Christ. None of this religious stuff, okay?
[time=3309] A personal relationship between you and Christ. You can have it for free. Let's pray together.
[time=3321] Father, thank you for the clear teaching in this book that's so consistent with itself. It talks about a faith that saves. It talks about a faith that transforms a life.
[time=3333] And for those of us here today who take the little test of five questions and can basically say yes at each point,
[time=3341] "Man, we want to praise you and thank you and bless you and say we don't deserve it." And God, thanks for saving us.
[time=3350] And we want to pray for those in this room today who have flunked the test, who can't say yes to those questions, who are missing the mark.
[time=3361] And we want to pray the power of the Spirit of God would do for them what it's done for us. Help them to admit the sin in their life, profoundly and deeply. Help them to face you, person to person, and ask you for salvation.
[time=3375] Commit their life to you and be born again. And we'll praise you for these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=3391] [MUSIC]
