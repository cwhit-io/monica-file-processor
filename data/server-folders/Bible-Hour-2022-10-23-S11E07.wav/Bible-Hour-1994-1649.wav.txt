[time=0] And how there was this astonishing shift of popular opinion.
[time=6] We're at the beginning of the week.
[time=8] They were crying out, Hosanna.
[time=10] They were singing his praises.
[time=12] They were, as you'll see this morning, telling about the many miracles that he had done.
[time=17] And many of the voices proclaiming his miracles were people who had themselves been healed by his power.
[time=24] And how this great, massive, popular opinion could shift from one of accolades and adoration
[time=30] and extolling the name of Christ to within a few short days that same very crowd crying
[time=36] out for his crucifixion.
[time=41] Welcome to The Bible Hour, an hour of Bible study, music and fellowship which we hope you'll
[time=58] find to be an encouragement.
[time=60] Thank you for joining us.
[time=62] When we read of the events of the last week of our Lord's life, it starts with the great praises of Hosanna to the Son of David, ends with that same crowd crying out for his death
[time=73] in the words crucify him.
[time=76] At first glance, it would appear that Jesus was overpowered by the forces of hell and taken to the cross against his will.
[time=83] It almost seems as if he got caught up in a web of political and religious intrigue that
[time=89] ran out of control.
[time=91] But a closer examination of the text reveals that Jesus knew exactly what he was doing in his triumphal entry and all the events that followed.
[time=100] In fact, he was allowing and even provoking the forces of evil to collide, knowing that
[time=106] it would eventually in his own crucifixion.
[time=109] Why would he do that?
[time=110] First day with us today is Pastor Moore answers that question.
[time=114] Our special music today will be provided by Denise Mitchell and Celebration.
[time=124] Let's join our sanctuary choir as they begin our service.
[time=211] That said Jesus come to me as I fall down at your feet.
[time=233] Let me touch your knees, I dance, Jesus I would see.
[time=243] Glory us, all of us, praise and praise you to me.
[time=255] Holy, worthy is a lamb who died for me.
[time=266] Glory us, all of us, praise and praise you to me.
[time=317] Glory, worthy is a lamb who died for me.
[time=327] Glory.

[time=373] Now let's return to our service.
[time=393] Have you heard the story, the Christ is finally here?
[time=399] Praise at the edge of the city, let's run, I've just got to be near him.
[time=406] All the people are shouting, they've come just to see their key.
[time=413] Tell the daughter of Zion, rejoice, for we've been redeemed.
[time=420] He is writing victorious, like the prophets foretold.
[time=427] Visions are glorious, we must fall down before Him, lay our hearts and souls before Him, Lord of all.
[time=440] Hosanna, Hosanna, see Him write in their destiny, Hosanna, Hosanna, Lord of all eternity.
[time=454] Hosanna, Hosanna, raise your hands in victory, Hosanna, Hosanna, He's come to set His people free.
[time=470] All your salvation, He comes to the willing heart, Blessed over all nations, His love will never depart.
[time=484] He is raining victorious and forever He is Lord.
[time=492] And Christ has delivered us, we must bow down before Him, lay our hearts and souls before Him, Lord of all.
[time=505] Hosanna, Hosanna, see Him write in their destiny, Hosanna, Hosanna, so long eternity.
[time=519] Hosanna, Hosanna, raise your hands in victory, Hosanna, Hosanna, He's come to set His people free.
[time=532] Hosanna, Hosanna, see Him write in their destiny, Hosanna, Hosanna, Lord of all eternity.
[time=546] Hosanna, Hosanna, raise your hands in victory, Hosanna, Hosanna, He's come to set His people free.
[time=559] He's come to set His people free.
[time=571] Well thank you for watching the Bible Hour today.
[time=578] I'd like to say Russell that there have been a number of letters that have come in some of them with specific prayer requests and it's really a joy for our staff to get together on Wednesdays and pray
[time=589] for these specific prayer requests.
[time=590] Well that's right it personalizes the whole process and takes us from just talking into a TV camera lens and really dealing with people's lives and we're thankful when you do that and just encourage you to keep that up.
[time=601] So remind you again to write to us if you really have a need or if you just have a little bit of time you say I watch the Bible Hour regularly just jot a note to us and tell us that you're watching.
[time=611] Well this is an exciting time of the year for the Christian as we've said before because of the music and the message that is at the heart of the message of Christianity.
[time=622] And Russell this is the Palm Sunday Easter season and I know you're anxious to preach a couple of messages that are on that topic.
[time=629] Well that's really true and it's nice because it's free from the incumbrances of the materialism
[time=636] of Christmas. You know that's of course a big Christian holiday but at Christmas time it's almost ground out by all the materialism of our day and now as Christians we can focus in on the
[time=648] triumphal entry and then of course Good Friday and Easter which really is the heart of the Christian message without having to deal with all the distractions.
[time=655] I'm especially thankful that we had an opportunity to have as we're recording this we'll be
[time=661] thinking about the Good Friday service and we're having communion service. Why is this so significant at that particular time?
[time=668] Well I think of all the days of the year for a Christian to take communion it would be on Good Friday and light of the fact that that's the day the Lord died and just to leave it at that I mean ponder that a few days until we come to Easter.
[time=681] And what is the what is the main significance of a Christian even taking communion?
[time=686] Just the remembrance of our Lord's death and continued opportunity to confess our sin and reaffirm our loyalty to him as we are reflective of the price our sin cost him.
[time=697] If you're watching the Bible hour this morning you're up already and you've just not decided whether you're going to attend church or not why don't you just come to our Easter services here at the Black Hawk Baptist Church. We'll have two services the first one is at 9.15
[time=710] and we'll have an identical service at 10.50 or 10 minutes before 11 o'clock.
[time=716] We'd love to see you here that'd be a great time for you to come and visit Black Hawk Baptist Church. So come on Easter Sunday morning and join with us either at 9.15 or at 10.50.
[time=728] A little bit earlier in the program we announced to you that we want to give to you a Bible book marker and it says it has to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ and we'll remind you of that resurrection and then at the bottom it tells you that it's from the Bible hour and the reason we want to give that to you is just to kind of remind you that it's really important that you pray for the Bible hour and keep us at the heart of your prayers because we need that reinforcement
[time=753] we need that communication from you just to let us know that the Bible hour is significant.
[time=759] We've had some good music already this morning and we look forward to some more from celebration and then the message from our pastor teacher Russell Moore. I hope you'll stay tuned and enjoy the music and the message from God's word.
[time=798] Jesus.
[time=829] The holy heart was broken sent from the Father's side the Son of God forsaken.
[time=846] The holy sacrifice.
[time=860] The holy lamb was stricken up and down the loathing.
[time=873] He bore the world's affliction.
[time=878] He bore it as his own.
[time=884] For me he was forsaken, for me he died alone, my sin forever taken,
[time=901] then I might be his own.
[time=915] And when my heart is broken, torn by my sin and pride,
[time=930] the Son of God now risen, will draw me to his side.
[time=942] For me he was forsaken, for me he died alone,
[time=954] my sin forever taken, then I might be his own.
[time=965] For me he was forsaken, for me he died alone,
[time=978] my sin forever taken, then I might be his own,
[time=1005] then I might be his own.
[time=1035] That's just wonderful.
[time=1042] We are so blessed to have that kind of talent and giftedness in our church.
[time=1048] Thank you, celebration and Scott.
[time=1051] Let me invite you to take your Bibles and come to Matthew, chapter 21, as we look at the account of Palm Sunday or the triumphal entry.
[time=1061] And we've looked at this passage before but it's gripped my heart again this week as I've thought about these thoughts and it's good for us to visit again the great and wonderful truth of the triumphal entry.
[time=1076] I have in my mind, I have very, very clear picture of a Sunday school lesson that I was involved in as a, I don't know, maybe a second or a third grader, stuck away in some little room at a little table with little chairs and a, you know, a lady that probably deserves some type of an award for sticking it out with us in the room as long as she did.
[time=1096] And it was of the triumphal entry or Palm Sunday.
[time=1100] And in my mind's eye, I can see the Lord sitting there or a picture of the Lord.
[time=1104] Of course, we don't know what he looked like, but a picture of the Lord sitting on a a full of a donkey, somebody had laid some blankets or some garments over that full and he was sitting on top of those.
[time=1115] And then there are these multitudes and multitudes of people standing behind him and in front of him
[time=1121] and they seem to be having cleared a path for him to move and they are in the process of taking off their garments and laying them down so he can ride over them and others have big palm branches
[time=1132] that have been cut and are also being weighed as he goes by and being laid down in front of him.
[time=1137] And it's this marvelous picture of a royal carpet leading him into the heavenly city,
[time=1143] the city of Jerusalem, and they're all in one accord.
[time=1146] Of course, you couldn't see this in the picture, but it was written at the bottom.
[time=1149] Hosanna with the great exclamation point underneath it.
[time=1152] And I carry with me from that picture several impressions about that wonderful marvelous day,
[time=1159] the first of which is this, that finally Christ is getting His just due.
[time=1164] Finally, after three years of public ministry in which no one has really recognized
[time=1170] and no great crowd of people has ever assembled to say what ought to have been said from the beginning, Hosanna to the Son of David, which is a messianic title from the Old Testament.
[time=1181] Finally, He was being worshiped, finally He was being honored, finally He was being revered, finally He was being acknowledged for the true and living God.
[time=1189] And what a great day that must have been.
[time=1191] A second impression that I bring with me from that account would be that it must have been
[time=1198] a bright moment for the Lord Jesus Christ on a personal level.
[time=1201] And we remember Him never having been recorded as having laughed in Scripture only that He wept,
[time=1208] a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and we know His life was long, and well the 33 years played long, and it was hard, and it was all about the work of His Father, and there were few times that we find in the Scripture where He was actually happy in His heart in a way that we could relate to, and I remember thinking, "My," He must have finally been happy, and feeling
[time=1229] loved and appreciated and honored, and inside having a sense of real togetherness about the way
[time=1236] that people were treating Him, a bright moment for Him personally, especially knowing that the disciples were there in that crowd, and Mary was there, and Martha was there, and Lazarus was there, being honored in front of the people who were meaning the most of Him might have brought a real
[time=1251] bright moment to His heart. And then thirdly, I remember as a child wondering how it all shifted so
[time=1257] fast, how this great crowd, crying great accolades, Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed as He who comes
[time=1265] in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest, how that same multitude of people could by the end
[time=1271] of the week be screaming, crucify Him, and taking instead a convicted criminal, almost as if He was
[time=1279] overpowered by the forces of hell, and the Lamb of God is helplessly slaughtered, unwittingly caught up
[time=1285] in a tragic web of religious and political intrigue that spun completely out of His control.
[time=1291] Overpowered by forces, He didn't fully understand and fully couldn't control.
[time=1298] But do you realize that not one of those impressions is accurate?
[time=1306] None of those is accurate to the text or to the word of God. It was not a time in which He was being
[time=1313] truly recognized for who He was. It was not a time of heartfelt worship. It was not a time where
[time=1319] the public and the populace finally really acknowledged in worship Jesus Christ for who He was.
[time=1325] They were screaming, "Hosanna, that is true," which means save now. Give us what we want now and
[time=1331] what they wanted and what they had in their minds and what they had in their heart to be saved from was the political domination of Rome. They were crying for political freedom and materialistic blessing.
[time=1342] The same blessings they would have read about, which they could anticipate in the Millennial Kingdom, prophetically given somewhat an availed form, but they could sense there was a day coming when their king would be there and everything would go as scheduled and everybody would be blessed and everybody would be rich and everybody would be happy. In the vernacular of our day they were screaming out lottery, lottery, lottery. They were throwing down their garments and they were throwing down
[time=1367] their palm branches. They were screaming out, "Here's the guy that's going to let us all win the
[time=1373] lottery and have all the stuff we ever wanted." Jesus Christ came preaching repentance. Repent for
[time=1380] the kingdom of heaven is at hand and what He was saying to them is, "I have come to deliver you from the bondage of Rome." I have not come to deliver you from the bondage of Rome but from the bondage of
[time=1392] your own sinfulness. You can be free from the power of sin. They had nothing to do with that. They had
[time=1398] no interest in it. They didn't understand it and that's not what they were crying for when they hailed Him on this marvelous day. Secondly, it was a bright, excuse me, it wasn't a bright spot for
[time=1410] Jesus personally. There was absolutely no enjoyment in this day for the Lord Jesus Christ. There was no
[time=1418] personal encouragement that He took from this event. John 12 tells us that those who were with Him and
[time=1425] knew Him, His disciples, and His dear friends, had absolutely no idea of what that day was about,
[time=1432] its meaning, its significance. In fact, it wasn't until after He had been crucified, was raised from the dead, ascended into heaven, and finally the Holy Spirit came, did they have any recollection as
[time=1444] to the true meaning of what Palm Sunday was all about. In other words, He was surrounded by His
[time=1450] closest friends, but an absolute isolation and total loneliness as to the significance of that moment.
[time=1456] They were as clueless to the event as were the mobs. In fact, this particular moment not only
[time=1464] was it not a bright spot, but I believe it ranks in one of the three most difficult and emotionally
[time=1470] traumatic experiences in the life of our Lord. Obviously, first would be His time on the cross,
[time=1476] second, His time in Gethsemane, and then I put this one right after those two, as the most
[time=1483] lonely and emotionally devastating moment of His life, and you'll see why as we move through the message. Furthermore, Jesus was not overpowered by the forces of evil. He was not unwittingly swept
[time=1496] up into some political intrigue that spun out of control and He became a helpless lamb of God
[time=1502] to be slaughtered. In fact, the absolute opposite is true. He was, in fact, provoking the forces of evil,
[time=1510] deliberately and consciously and skillfully provoking the forces of evil, in order to set off a chain
[time=1519] reaction of events that would follow its way all the way through the week until it finally culminated in His own crucifixion. He knew exactly what He was doing because Jesus had not come to make war
[time=1531] with Rome. He had come to make peace with God and the only way to make peace with God was to die.
[time=1538] So you say, "What is the significance of Palm Sunday?" What is the significance of the triumphal
[time=1549] entry? What are we to make of the pictures that fill our minds from our Sunday school lessons as Jesus rides upon the cult of a donkey? It is precisely this. Jesus was purposefully orchestrating the
[time=1564] triumphal entry as a demonstration, allowing the masses in all their frenzied excitement to
[time=1571] provoke the Pharisees in such a way that by Friday, both the multitudes themselves and their leaders
[time=1578] would be crying out for His life, which He would then willingly give. Happily give. Or it was all
[time=1590] a part of the plan of God. It's important to make a very definite distinction between the fact that
[time=1597] Jesus was innocent in His death. Hebrews 7 says, "He's the holy innocent undefiled separated from sinner's Lamb of God." There is no question that He was innocent, but that's a long way from Him being a victim in death. An innocent person in death, yes, a victim in death, absolutely not. Matthew 20,
[time=1616] "I did not come to be served but to serve and to give my life a ransom for many." John 10,
[time=1622] "No one has taken my life away from me, but I lay it down of my own accord." Matthew 27, Jesus,
[time=1629] hanging there on the cross, crying out with a loud voice, and then it says, "He yielded up His own spirit." Jesus was not directly killed by anyone. Jesus did not die of natural causes. He gave
[time=1642] His life a... Jesus came to die, but Jesus came to die in a prescribed place and in a prescribed way,
[time=1653] and most importantly this morning in a prescribed time. There was a time that Jesus would die.
[time=1661] There was a time when He would come and have His life put on the cross at which time He could
[time=1668] then freely give it. From His birth, everybody was wanting to kill Him. Herod slaughtered tens of thousands of babies trying to wipe out the life of Jesus Christ. The Pharisees all through His
[time=1680] public ministry were trying to kill Him, and He was constantly having to withdraw
[time=1686] as the hostilities would rise or He would be subject to a premature death. After cleansing the
[time=1692] temple for the first time, the Pharisees were so agitated and so outraged that He had to withdraw,
[time=1698] or He would have been killed. Jealousy developed over His unique relationship with John the Baptist,
[time=1705] which could have eventually entered His own death, and so He had to withdraw. When His hometown rejected Him, He had to withdraw. On His second visit to Jerusalem, He met with such immense rejection there by the religious leaders that the text says He had to withdraw. Beginning His third
[time=1721] year of ministry, His adopted city of cappernium wanted to kill Him, and so He had to withdraw,
[time=1728] to say for regions of Palestine. Over and over and over again, the hostilities would mount, and over and over and over again, Jesus would withdraw. Why? Because His time had not yet come.
[time=1740] His time to die had not yet come, and it was all appointed by God, and He was not going to have that preempted. At the wedding at Canaan, you remember in the first public, at least the first
[time=1752] recorded public ministry of our Lord, His mother was there trying to push Him off into a more prominent
[time=1758] position there as He would have turned the water into wine, and He said to her, "Woman, what do I have to do with you? My hour has not come." His brothers full of sarcasm and disbelief often tried to
[time=1772] push Him into the public eye and urged Him in that direction, and He would say to them, "My time has not yet come." In John 8, after having taught with authority, they were trying to seize Him,
[time=1783] but it says that they couldn't get a whole of Him because His time had not yet come.
[time=1789] Finally, with the triumphal entry, finally with Paul Sunday, His time had come.
[time=1794] John 12 reports about this event, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
[time=1801] Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour."
[time=1807] But then He finishes His prayer, "But for this purpose, I came to this hour."
[time=1817] And finally in John 19, as He hangs upon the cross and others, it is finished. What He means by that is all the things that I was supposed to do according to the divine time schedule is now over. It's finished,
[time=1827] it's done. I've paid the price of sin in the exact way, in the exact place, and in the exact time
[time=1833] that I was supposed to fulfill Old Testament prophecy. So the ingredients of His crucifixion had
[time=1840] always been there. The explosive components of His crucifixion had always been there. One,
[time=1846] the grasping hysteria of the masses who, like leeches, would attach themselves to Christ and try to
[time=1852] suck from Him His very lifeblood so that they could have a prosperous, materialistically happy life.
[time=1858] That hysteria thrown against the seething deep-seated jealousy and hatred of Jewish religious leaders
[time=1866] were all that it needed to explode into His crucifixion. And through His triumphal entry,
[time=1872] Christ orchestrated, Christ directed, and Christ allowed those evil forces to collide and then
[time=1879] explode into His own crucifixion because now His time was at hand. So with that as an introduction
[time=1888] to our text, let's look again at Matthew 21 and be reminded of just four simple elements of the
[time=1895] triumphal entry, the place, the presentation, the pageantry, and the product. First, the place. It was,
[time=1903] as it says in verse 1, Jerusalem. And every city has its certain motif on the ance. There is that
[time=1911] certain something that captures the essence of a city. San Francisco, the city by the bay, New York,
[time=1918] the big apple, Hong Kong, for centuries has been known as the jewel of the Orient. For many,
[time=1925] Jerusalem was known as the place to go and make sacrifice for sin. The place to go and be cleansed from your own sin. The place to be restored in your relationship with God.
[time=1935] Not so to Christ. Christ saw a completely different side of Jerusalem. For Christ, it wasn't a place
[time=1943] to make sacrifice for sin. It was the place to be sacrificed for sin. For Christ, it wasn't the
[time=1949] place to be free and to be rid and to be cleansed of personal sin. It was the place to assume everybody else's personal sin. In fact, to become sin. For Christ, it wasn't a place to be restored in
[time=1960] relationship to God. It was the place where for the first time in all of His earthly life and from
[time=1966] all eternity past to ever have been separated in His relationship with God. My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? The word or the city Jerusalem was synonymous in the mind of Christ
[time=1976] with crucifixion and He has been telling His disciples that over and over again. Earlier in the book
[time=1982] of Matthew, He says, for that time or from that time Jesus began to show His disciples that He must
[time=1988] go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders in chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised up on the third day. It was synonymous. Jerusalem, crucifixion, synonymous. Again, in the book
[time=2002] of Matthew a little bit later, still even prior to the triumphal entry. And Jesus was about to go up
[time=2008] to Jerusalem. He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves on the way and said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes and they will condemn Him to death. Deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify Him and
[time=2024] on the third day He'll be raised from the dead." You might hold your place there in Matthew and come
[time=2030] to Luke for a minute. Luke chapter 19, again, a bit of an insight into how closely tied this notion
[time=2038] of His own death was to the city of Jerusalem and even the sight of it. Jesus is making His way
[time=2045] here to the triumphal entry that Luke 19 covers the same basic material. He's coming down from Jericho,
[time=2052] he stops in Bethany for a few days, then has to ascend the west slope of the Mount of olives and finally crests over the top where he then, for the first time, sees Jerusalem. You can pick it up
[time=2066] in verse 41 and when he approached, he saw the city and repped over it. Luke 19, 41. In other words,
[time=2074] as he finally crests over the top of the Mount of olives and he can see for the first time the city
[time=2080] of Jerusalem, he weeps over it. He breaks down. I remember there's a great throng of people all around Him, His best friends, surround Him. They're all singing His praise, Hosanna to the Son of David.
[time=2090] All this is going on but Christ with the glimpse of Jerusalem begins to weep. Why? Verse 42,
[time=2097] "If you had known in this day, even you, the things which make for peace, but now they have been
[time=2104] hidden from your eyes, for the day shall come upon you, when your enemies will throw you, throw up a bank before you and surround you and him you in on every side, and will level you to the ground and your children with you and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation." He's weeping because he knows that
[time=2124] because of their hardheartedness, they themselves will have to undergo the great destruction of AD 70
[time=2130] and the absolute annihilation of their city, and with that they fail to recognize the things which
[time=2137] make for peace, his own death, his own crucifixion is in part the product of their hardheartedness.
[time=2145] And so he sees Jerusalem and he remembers that is the city of my death, as I have been telling my disciples now for many, many months, I must go, I must go, I must go to Jerusalem and there I must
[time=2157] die, and that in principle part is why I count this as one of his darkest emotional hours.
[time=2163] He weeps out openly and publicly, while everyone else is singing and anticipating great political
[time=2173] prosperity and material blessing. Back to Matthew 21, and remember as you turn there those
[time=2181] poignant echoing words of our Christ, "Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those
[time=2188] who are sent to her." In other words, Christ is remembering that passage comes from Matthew 23 and
[time=2195] you don't need to turn there, but in that passage, "Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets Christ with a perfect knowledge of all that had gone on before his coming is seeing profit after
[time=2206] profit, after profit, after profit coming to the people of Jerusalem and each one of them being rejected and stoned." And he says in his own heart and in his own mind, "And today I am the
[time=2217] prophet. I am the one that they will take and kill. I am the one now in the long line of faithful
[time=2224] and godly men who will be rejected by this hardhearted and rebellious people of Jerusalem."
[time=2231] So the place of the triumphal entry is Jerusalem. Secondly, the presentation.
[time=2237] That covers verses 2 to 7 there. The central part of it is an Old Testament quote from Zachariah 9.
[time=2244] Zachariah 9.9, you can see it in verse 5, "Say to the daughter of Zion, behold your king is coming
[time=2250] to you, gentle and mounted on a donkey even on a cult, the full of the beast of burden." We don't
[time=2257] have time to go back this morning, but if we did, we could go back and see Zachariah 9 verses 1 through 8.
[time=2262] The passage that immediately precedes this quote and it describes a great human conqueror who would spare Jerusalem. It happened to have been fulfilled in the time of Alexander the Great,
[time=2272] by Alexander the Great, who did come and conquer and who did spare Jerusalem. And so in our minds, I, we can picture this great and mighty earthly conqueror. He comes writing not on a donkey, but on probably a great white steed or some regal chariot and his sword is flashing in the sun.
[time=2289] A great entourage of military might goes before him and comes after him, all of his generals,
[time=2295] all of his men, all the weapons of war, all the spoils of war, all the captives that he's taken.
[time=2299] And in sharp and distinct contrast to this kind of earthly human conquest comes then in verse 5 of
[time=2306] your text, "But hold your king is coming to you gentle and mounted on a donkey, even on a cult,
[time=2315] the full of a beast of burden." Why? Because Jesus Christ did not come to conquer kingdoms made by men.
[time=2326] He came to conquer the kingdom of Satan and of darkness and of death and of doom. And the only way he could do that in this first of his coming was in his humiliation, which was the great gentleness and humility of heart that took him in love all the way to death.
[time=2340] You remember his words, "Come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest."
[time=2348] He looks out across the masses of Israel and notices that they are weary and heavy laden under a false religious system. They've been duped into believing that they could earn their way to heaven by their own good works and by their own religious deeds and he says, "Oh, you're heavy laden under this stuff and you're weary." So then he says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn for me for I am gentle
[time=2370] and humble in heart. And you shall find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my load is light,
[time=2377] the only possible way, the only possible way for mankind to be relieved from the burden of its own sin
[time=2383] was for the gentle, humble, hearted Christ to come even exemplified as by riding in to his great
[time=2390] earthly coronation, the true king of kings, the true Lord of lords, the one who had created it all,
[time=2397] spoke it into existence. His great day of coronation is nothing like that of a, the pomp and circumstance
[time=2404] given to an earthly king. He comes humble and gentle mounted on a donkey." And so they should have
[time=2411] understood, shouldn't they? They should have got the message. Well, then there is thirdly the pageant
[time=2422] tree. Look at verse 8, chapter 21 verse 8, "Most of the multitudes spread their garments in the road
[time=2432] and others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them in the road. Garments were used in
[time=2438] these kinds of circumstances to be laid down in front of the king as if to say, 'You can walk on us,
[time=2444] we'll be submissive to you.'" J. Hubein, second king's nine, when he was corned king, they took their garments and laid them on the steps and then he walked right down over them,
[time=2454] as if to say, "You're our king, you're our ruler." And we have very little concept of that in our day and age. What it would be like to serve under a monarch, those monarchs we do know and see are principally inform only and have no ruling power. And so our whole society is divorced from the kind of worship and adoration and submission that you would give to an earthly king who had that kind of power. But that's why they're throwing their garments. It's a symbolic statement, "We
[time=2479] submit to you. We're at your feet." And Palm branches and scriptures symbolize great joy and
[time=2486] rejoicing. And so these themes come together, "We'll submit to you and we'll submit to you with great
[time=2492] joy and rejoicing because we expect from you, political freedom from Rome, and more circumstantial
[time=2498] blessing than we could ever conceive, empty as it is, at least they had the right trappings."
[time=2504] This great royal carpet spreads itself all the way to Jerusalem.
[time=2508] In verse nine, it's difficult to detect, but there's something very interesting going on. The
[time=2515] multitudes going before him and those followed after were crying out and saying, "And then there is their song, Hosanna to the Son of David, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest." There are actually two groups in view here. There is the first group,
[time=2529] which is coming with him. You see everybody's making their trek at this point of the year to Jerusalem.
[time=2535] And when Jesus passes through Jericho and comes into Bethany, anybody in those areas who was going to move towards Jerusalem grabs on to that opportunity and kind of moves in this huge caravan to go with
[time=2546] the miracle worker because there is the idea or the hope anyway that he might work another miracle.
[time=2550] When he gets into Bethany, that is the place where Lazarus had laid in his tomb and where great numbers
[time=2556] of people had seen and heard then and actually seen Lazarus after the fact so the crowd gets even larger. So there is this great crowd coming with him as he makes his trek to Jerusalem for the Passover.
[time=2568] But there is a second group and John 12 tells us about it. The city of Jerusalem is already
[time=2574] teeming with people. Not the crowd that Jesus is bringing but people coming from all different regions have already made it there. They are early. They are excited. The census was taken about 10 years after this particular Passover and it recorded that 260,000 lambs were slaughtered in
[time=2590] that particular Passover, which would have the law provided one lamb for every 10 adults so we can anticipate at least two million plus people bulging the boundaries of Jerusalem. There is no
[time=2603] reason to believe that the size of the city would have been any different in those 10 years span.
[time=2606] So there is this great crowd and it's hard to estimate whether it's tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people coming out from the city when they finally hear that Jesus is about to approach. And they would have known. They would have looked out there and seen this great group of people walking and there would have maybe been a single solitary figure out in front and so as they had already been talking about his coming and they were already excited about his being their Hosanna and everybody winning the lottery. They just kind of rush out there and these two huge multitudes collide and form one vast company of people. Son of David they call him a Messianic title
[time=2645] from 2 Samuel 7 and so it's full of excitement and the place is reaching a fervor pitch. You say,
[time=2653] well what's the product of all this versus 10 and 11? What was Jesus producing here? Verse 10 and when
[time=2662] he entered Jerusalem all the city was stirred saying this, excuse me saying who is this and the
[time=2668] multitudes were saying this is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee. My Bible translates that
[time=2675] word stirred I don't know how yours does but it does an injustice to the Greek word which means to have been shaken by an earthquake. We have new understanding of the fear and the tear and the all encompassing reality of being shaken by an earthquake as we hear reports still coming from Southern California of people who can't go back into their homes for fear who still sleep in their cars, who are moving by the hundreds out of Southern California so that they never get shaken like
[time=2701] that again. That's the root word behind this word stirred when Jesus Christ and his entourage of
[time=2708] people finally hit Jerusalem, all of them proclaiming his miracles. Lazarus the greatest of the miracles
[time=2714] walking by his side and great numbers of people from Bethany saying that's the man he raised from the dead and that's the Jesus who did it and in this great company there would have been others who had actually had the miracle performed on them and they'd come and they'd say see I used to be a leper but you can touch me now you'll never get my disease it's gone I've been healed and other
[time=2735] people saying I can see hold up your fingers I'll count them for you though I was born blind. I'll
[time=2742] raise you to the corner I spent my whole life on a mat until the day Jesus walked by and now I'll
[time=2749] raise you down there. You see this great company of people was giving witness and testimony to the
[time=2755] miracles that Jesus had done in their own lives and the miracles that they had seen in other people's lives and after three years of long ministry there were thousands of them who had been touched
[time=2765] and so as they finally break their way through the city gates the city is literally shaken to its
[time=2772] foundation it is the all-encompassing topic it is the only thing people are talking about it
[time=2778] preempted all the other concerns it was the preeminent topic of discussion and Jerusalem was teaming with people who were obsessed and frenzied as they welcomed this Messiah to the city
[time=2789] and that is exactly what he wanted to have happened because then it would leave the Pharisees no option you might come if you want to to Luke 19
[time=2803] you'll see an interesting insight into how all this is happening
[time=2811] you can see in verse 37 they coming over the Mount of Olives there's a whole multitude of disciples who began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen we were just talking about that they're crying out in verse 38 blessed is the king who comes
[time=2826] in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest man they're pulling out their Old Testament stuff that's Psalm 118 26 look at verse 39 and some of the Pharisees in the
[time=2838] multitude said to him teacher rebuke your disciples rebuke these people in other words don't let them
[time=2848] say that about you don't let them call you the king don't let them call you the Lord don't let
[time=2855] them say you are the one who will bring in peace and glory we can't stand to hear him say that
[time=2863] you're driving us nuts but he allowed them he allowed the masses to escalate in their praises
[time=2871] and their hysteria and the hysteria of the moment because he knew that as he did the Pharisees would have to make their move and plot to kill him which is exactly what they did in Matthew 26 you don't
[time=2885] need to turn there Matthew 26 3 through 4 it says this then the chief priest and all the elders of the people were gathered together in the court of the high priest and they plotted together to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him back to Matthew 21 so you can see you can see how he was
[time=2910] orchestrating these two great sinful forces on the one hand the greedy selfish materialism of the
[time=2920] masses thrown against the incredible jealousy of the religious leaders who saw that their flock
[time=2928] was running after another was it true worship and recognition of our Lord absolutely not
[time=2936] you're crying out save us give us what we want solve our problems make us better fill our bank accounts
[time=2943] and to be fair this morning I have to admit to you and I trust you will to yourself that
[time=2949] it is so often that I come to the same Christ with the same exact plea in my heart
[time=2958] save now give me what I want now relieve me from the pressures of my life now solve my problems now
[time=2969] and when he is reluctant to do that there is a muteness anger that grows in my heart
[time=2978] and at times would like to turn on him and say well if you're not going to be a god who can
[time=2985] solve my problems you may as well not be my god at all was it a bright moment for him personally
[time=2995] absolutely not it was one of the darkest hours of his life as Christ moved with purpose towards the things of God and towards God's intended purpose for his life he found himself those surrounded
[time=3006] by friends incredibly lonely because he was all alone and I find that same principle is true
[time=3015] in our Christian lives there are times went to walk an obedience to the word of God to carry out his purpose for our life though we may at times be surrounded by friends we are misunderstood our
[time=3026] motives are impugned there are few who really understand the significance of that moment in our life
[time=3032] and we like Christ though doing the will of God can be very very much alone I think that goes with
[time=3041] the territory I think it goes with the territory of being a Christian who wants to follow Christ with a whole heart and you can expect that reality to occur in your life and when it does find there your sympathetic high priest who at what might have been the pinnacle of his public
[time=3057] proclaim was absolutely alone
[time=3066] and lastly know he was not overcome by the powers of evil he was instead provoking them to
[time=3072] eventuate his own death and you say Russell that sounds very morbid why would Christ do that
[time=3080] why would Christ bring about his own death the answer is because he loves you
[time=3086] and the only possible way that he could be the sacrifice for your sins was to die for you
[time=3096] and so as you see him in your mind's eye mounted on that little donkey making his way over the crest
[time=3104] of the mount of olives and seeing for the first time the city of Jerusalem and breaking down in tears and weeping but moving and exorably towards the cross remember he had you in his heart
[time=3115] it was you he was going to save it was you he was going to die for it was you he was going to help
[time=3126] the man I suggest to you this week you who are saved you who know Christ and as you anticipate good
[time=3134] Friday and then the blessed day of Easter may I invite you to live this week with that same commitment
[time=3141] and purpose to live for the purposes of God with as much commitment and as much resolution even in
[time=3148] the midst of loneliness self sacrificial acts of love to your wife and your husband and your children
[time=3157] and the people you're around and in that way really prepared your heart to celebrate Easter
[time=3164] for you who are not saved for you who have never accepted Christ as your personal Lord and Savior
[time=3174] for you who have never dealt face to face as it were in a personal conversation with Christ where you admit your sinfulness and you admit that you are unworthy of heaven and that no amount of good deeds could ever balance the scales and find your way into heaven because God standard is absolute
[time=3190] perfection for you who have never had that crucial moment with Christ may I say to you that he
[time=3198] had you in his heart as well and that the sins that you are still hanging on to the very sins that
[time=3204] will condemn you to death physically and spiritually forever in a christless eternity eternity he had those
[time=3210] sins in his heart on his mind and was dying for those as he moved to the cross but if you don't accept
[time=3219] him as your Savior if you don't acknowledge his sacrifice and commit your life to him and trust
[time=3227] yourself completely to him and as it were throw your garments at his feet with the proper intention of saying truly no matter what you do with my life I will serve you not on a conditional basis of
[time=3239] your pleasing me just take my life and use it unless you come to that place in your life where you
[time=3245] personally identify that reality with Christ then his going to the cross as far as your concern
[time=3262] father in the quiet moment of our hearts we want to reflect on a man so marvelous
[time=3272] who even to the last moment of life on the cross could have healed himself completely and
[time=3279] totally and come down off that cross who even to the very last second could have reversed the whole
[time=3288] course of events and never died but who even before natural causes took his life gave it freely
[time=3298] so that we might live as we reflect upon this wonderful person of Christ we just want to say thank
[time=3311] you for that great sacrifice and for that wonderful reality touching our lives may we never
[time=3319] tire of the story may we never become bored with its truth Lord never allow the impact of that truth
[time=3327] to stop changing the way we live and as we anticipate seeing him in that same physical bodily form
[time=3340] seeing the nail pierced hands seeing the scar in his side seeing the feet also with nail pierced scars
[time=3349] as we anticipate being embraced by him and held by him and loved by him and squeezed by him
[time=3358] maybe live in light of that great love I mean all that we say and do come as a response
[time=3369] to his love for us to walk all the way to the cross we pray these things in Christy
