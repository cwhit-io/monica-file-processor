[time=0] Now, to the predictions which will come true, seven predictions that I guarantee will come
[time=14] true in 1995, seven of them for you this morning.
[time=24] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=29] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=31] Like any other year, 1995, we'll hold its share of unexpected events.
[time=36] Some of these events will be delightful surprises.
[time=39] Others will be very disappointing.
[time=41] There's no way to predict what they will be or when they'll happen.
[time=45] But there are a few things about 1995 that we can predict with absolute certainty.
[time=51] In fact, there are seven predictions about 95 that we can take to the bank.
[time=56] They will come true.
[time=58] If you'd like to know what they are, stay with us as Pastor Moore gives us seven surefire predictions for 1995.
[time=66] But think about this, in a world where everything seems to be in transition, isn't it comforting to know that there's a constant on whom we can depend?
[time=75] Just consider for a moment that changes, both expected and unexpected, that we're facing
[time=81] every day.
[time=82] Two years clearance, taken additional 25% off already reduced clearance merchandise throughout
[time=88] the instance.
[time=89] Male deposited before final collection Saturday will be delivered at the 1994 price.
[time=93] After that however, first class letters will require 32 cents posted.
[time=97] The U.S. population has climbed to 261.7 million.
[time=101] 1994 began peacefully in Allen County, but the year turned out to be the deadliest the county has ever seen with 34 times.
[time=108] Or the mountains were born, or before you brought forth the earth and the world.
[time=114] From everlasting to everlasting, you are God.
[time=118] Whatever else the New Year brings, Americans will see a raft of state laws aimed at making them feel more secure.
[time=125] Around the country, lawmakers have come down harder on criminals, especially young.
[time=129] After the strong growth in 1994, the U.S. economy will slow next year, but avoid a recession the government for.
[time=135] North Korean officials released an American helicopter pilot shot down 12 days ago within their southern border, ending a crisis that threatened the fragile people.
[time=143] 1,000 days ago, Sarajevo was an open place where people still thought of building bridges not burning them.
[time=149] Now the city's landmarks have been destroyed and its cemeteries are filled with 10,000.
[time=153] The Lord foils the plans of the nations.
[time=156] He forts the purposes of the peoples.
[time=159] But the plans of the Lord stand firm forever.
[time=162] The purposes of his heart through all generations.
[time=165] Fire heavily damaged a home on East Fairfax Avenue yesterday.
[time=169] The house was engulfed in flames when fire fired.
[time=171] A fire gutted several rooms in a Virginia hospital Saturday night, killing four people and injuring others.
[time=177] Emergency workers rushed a victim of a car accident on West Jefferson Boulevard into an ambulance Thursday.
[time=182] The driver of one car was pronounced dead at Lutheran Hospital.
[time=186] The second driver and his passenger were injured.
[time=188] My days are like the evening shadow, I wither away like grass.
[time=193] But you, O Lord, sit in throne forever.
[time=196] Your renown endures through all generations.
[time=200] An earthquake cracked the streets, walls and floors in northern Japan on Wednesday night, killing at least two people and injuring two hundred and earthquake.
[time=207] An earthquake registering 5.7, China's southwestern province before dawn Friday, causing houses
[time=213] to collapse and opening cracks.
[time=214] His second earthquake in two days rocked the south coast Saturday, injuring 50 people.
[time=219] Some of them school children hurt.
[time=221] In the beginning, you laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands.
[time=227] They will perish, but you remain.
[time=230] They will all wear out like a garment.
[time=233] Like clothing, you will change them and they will be discarded.
[time=237] But you remain the same and your years will never end.
[time=242] Tired of games, divorced, white male, 31, brown hair, blue eyes, enjoys music, sports
[time=248] and outdoors, seeking special single white female who enjoys the same.
[time=252] A guard at the Westville Correctional Center shot and killed his wife in a Christmas day argument over their children, then killed himself, authorities.
[time=260] Attorneys throughout the state said they see an increase in the number of people filing for divorce during January, indicating the holidays are not necessarily a happy time forever.
[time=269] Speaking of the Lord's great love forever, with my mouth I will make your faithfulness known through all generations, I will declare that your love stands firm forever, that you
[time=281] established your faithfulness in heaven itself.
[time=284] O Lord God almighty, who is like you, you are mighty O Lord, and your faithfulness surrounds
[time=299] the Lord, life can be so hard, never knowing what each day will bring to where you are.
[time=315] Sometimes I forget, sometimes I can see, that whatever comes my way, you will be the
[time=328] way with me.
[time=332] My life is in your hands, my heart is in your keeping, I'm never without hope, not when
[time=346] my future is with you.
[time=351] My life is in your hands and though I may not see clearly, I will lift my voice and sing
[time=364] 'Cause your love does amazing things, Lord I know my life is in your hands.
[time=383] Nothing is for sure, nothing is for keeps; all I know is that your love will live eternally.
[time=401] So I will find my rest, and I will find my peace, knowing that you'll meet my end.
[time=413] My life is in your hands, my heart is in your keeping, I'm never without hope, not when
[time=433] my future is with you, my life is in your hands and though I may not see clearly, I will lift
[time=448] my voice and sing 'Cause your love does amazing things,
[time=456] Lord I know my life is in your hands, when I'm at my weakest hope, you carry me.
[time=474] And I become my strongest, Lord, in your hands.
[time=501] My life is in your hands and though I may not see clearly, I will lift my voice and sing
[time=516] 'Cause your love does amazing things, Lord I know my life is in your hands.
[time=529] I trust you, Lord, my life is in your hands.
[time=552] Hi, and welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=555] My name is Russell Moore, and I want to thank you for joining us today.
[time=559] Thank you, Lord.
[time=560] I want to thank you for giving us that you're ready for this brand new year and all that God will do in your life through the coming year.
[time=565] I'm so thankful this year as I look back on '94 just for the number of people that God
[time=571] brought to Himself into a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[time=574] And I can't think of anything that excites me more than seeing people come to a realization of their need for Christ and becoming born again through a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[time=586] At the end of this year, we had a Christmas Eve communion service, and there were, oh, twelve, thirteen hundred people there.
[time=592] We were just praising God around the Lord's table, and a couple that had recently come
[time=598] to the Lord not more than six months ago caught my eye.
[time=601] They were sitting in the back row, and I saw them there.
[time=604] Just the sense that no more than this time last year, they were lost.
[time=609] They didn't have Christ.
[time=610] They were bound for a Christless eternity.
[time=612] And now, by His grace, they not only know about salvation, they have received salvation
[time=618] and would take time on a Christmas Eve to gather with God's people and celebrate communion.
[time=623] It was just the other day that I was visiting with a good friend of mine.
[time=628] He had led a person to the Lord, and so we went to visit this new Christian, and again,
[time=634] the sense of something significant has happened in this person's life.
[time=639] Once they didn't know Christ, and now they do, and things for them are now eternally different.
[time=645] So I'm thankful for that, and I'm thankful that the gospel goes out through the Bible hour, that each and every Sunday morning, and again on Thursdays, we can present Christ to those who would listen and watch and have a sense of their own need for Christ.
[time=658] I guess because of that, I'm especially thankful for those of you who participated in our year end giving project for the Bible hour.
[time=665] It's just gone wonderfully.
[time=667] We didn't quite get enough to buy the new tape machine that we're hoping for.
[time=671] We'll work at that another time and another day, but I want you to know that you've given and you've given generously, and you've met the needs of our general budget, and we just have a profound sense of gratitude for your sacrifice, for your participation, and for your partnership in the gospel.
[time=686] I hope now you'll continue to pray for the ministry of the Bible hour as we present Christ to those who need Him so much.
[time=692] Thank you.
[time=722] My soul, He guides my path in righteousness for His name, same, surely goodness and loving
[time=743] kindness shall follow me all the days of my life.
[time=752] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever and ever.
[time=766] Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear thou art with me.
[time=783] Thy rod and thy staff, they come for me, thou prepare us to table before me in the presence
[time=799] of my enemies, surely goodness and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my
[time=817] life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever and ever, surely goodness
[time=837] and loving kindness shall follow me all the days of my life.
[time=847] And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever and ever.
[time=862] The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[time=871] Amen, would You sing with me, "Great is thy faithfulness, great is thy faithfulness,
[time=885] by morning new mercies I see, all I have needed, thy hand hath probed it, great is
[time=906] thy faithfulness, Lord unto me."
[time=927] To be here with these people in this place on this day, thank You, God, for meeting with
[time=935] us today.
[time=936] Thank You for being the God of our worship, for being the one that we can lift our hearts to every single word we have sung.
[time=945] This morning has been true.
[time=947] You are this awesome, phenomenal, unfathomable, gracious, loving being, and we're just overflowing
[time=957] with love and gratitude for who You are.
[time=959] We thank You for the privilege of worship and pray these things in Christ's name.
[time=964] And all God's people said, "Hey, men." Well, 1995 is here and a lot of people are wondering what it will bring.
[time=975] So I have some predictions for you this morning.
[time=978] They fall into three categories, the first predictions that probably won't come true.
[time=985] Things that people are saying about 1995 that probably will not come true.
[time=990] And for these predictions I have searched high and low, gone all the way to Rogers for the National Enquirer and the Examiner.
[time=996] In the area of health, ancient documents will be discovered beneath the Sphinx.
[time=1003] They will hold the keys to healing and longevity.
[time=1006] They will change medicine as we know it today.
[time=1011] Angela Lansbury will lay her hand on the head of a friend in the hospital and discover she has miraculous healing powers when the woman miraculously recovers.
[time=1022] They both wake up and come out of the dream.
[time=1024] All right.
[time=1025] In the spirit world, startling new evidence proving the existence of angels on the planet will surface.
[time=1031] Even longtime naysayers like scientists will be unable to doubt their presence.
[time=1037] In the world of politics, hang on.
[time=1041] Hillary Clinton will stun the world when she files for a legal separation from Bill Clinton
[time=1047] and announces her own candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination.
[time=1054] The first part isn't so stunning, the second part certainly is.
[time=1057] This is followed up by this prediction, the ghost of Jackie Kennedy will appear to Hillary
[time=1065] and encourage her to run for the presidency in 1996.
[time=1069] Jackie will tell her quote, "I always knew I was smarter than my husband and you are too."
[time=1078] George Bush will team up with Ross Perot and announce that they are running for the Republican presidential nomination.
[time=1085] In the subsequent election, they will trounce Hillary Clinton.
[time=1089] Last, but not least in the area of politics, poor financial advice and bad investments will
[time=1097] cause conservative watchdog Rush Limbaugh to lose his fortune and become destitute.
[time=1104] Forced on welfare, Rush will become a Democrat.
[time=1111] Predictions that are not likely to occur, you understand.
[time=1118] Predictions that probably will come true in 1995, Bobby Knight will probably do better next year than he did this year.
[time=1126] The baseball players and owners will probably work out their differences this year and we will get to see a few ball games next year.
[time=1133] The Republicans will probably do something right in the House and the Senate in the coming year.
[time=1140] The Moors will probably not have another baby in 1995.
[time=1152] In Indiana, it will probably yet seize a real winter with some snow and some figures down in the teens, maybe the single digit numbers.
[time=1160] The City of Fort Wayne will continue to likely see murders.
[time=1166] People in Fort Wayne will come down with cancer.
[time=1168] People in Fort Wayne will be divorced.
[time=1171] Your best friend will probably let you down sometime in 1995.
[time=1180] Now to the predictions which will come true.
[time=1187] Seven predictions that I guarantee will come true in 1995, seven of them for you this morning.
[time=1196] Number one, God will forgive your sins in 1995.
[time=1204] Every last one of them.
[time=1211] Do you realize that every single moment of every single day, God will hold true to his
[time=1218] posture of forgiving you for your sins?
[time=1223] It says in Romans 5-20, "And the law came in that the transgression might increase, but
[time=1229] where sin increased, grace abounded all the more."
[time=1236] What that's telling us is that no matter how sinful you may become in 1995, no matter
[time=1242] how low you may sink into the mire of immorality, no matter how consistently you return back
[time=1249] to the besetting sins that have plagued you since your youth, God will forgive you.
[time=1257] God has a super abounding grace that when your sin escalates and when you mount up one
[time=1264] sin after another, breaking the law time and time and time and time again, there is this
[time=1270] ocean of grace that rushes in and smothers all your sin.
[time=1276] God will forgive you if you commit fornication.
[time=1284] God will forgive you if you commit adultery.
[time=1287] God will forgive you if you practice homosexual acts.
[time=1292] God will forgive you if you steal things that are not yours.
[time=1300] God will forgive you if you revile his name and the people of God.
[time=1306] God will forgive you if you swindle.
[time=1309] Do you realize this? True prediction.
[time=1313] Not once.
[time=1316] On any given day in 1995, as you walk your way into every conceivable sin known to mankind
[time=1325] and the ones which will evidence themselves in your life, not once for a second, will
[time=1331] God ever consider the possibility of refusing to forgive your sins?
[time=1339] It will never even cross his mind.
[time=1344] He will never once think about dealing with you according to your sin.
[time=1350] He will never once think about giving you what you deserve in light of your iniquity.
[time=1358] He says in the book of Lamentations, my mercies are new every morning.
[time=1365] And what he is saying there is he is saying to you as you get up every day and as you see
[time=1371] the sun rise, my mercies are new every morning, every time there's a sunrise.
[time=1379] So it is my mercies are extended to you.
[time=1383] Let it be a reminder to you friends, every single morning in 1995 that God's mercies are
[time=1390] new to you.
[time=1392] They will never run out.
[time=1394] He will never be able, you will never be able to exhaust his capacity to forgive you for the things that you have done.
[time=1402] As if he's saying just as I will not run out of sunrises, I will not run out of forgiveness.
[time=1408] I will commit my forgiveness to you a new and a fresh every single day of this coming year.
[time=1419] I can tell you one thing that will happen for sure in 1995.
[time=1424] God will forgive you for your sins.
[time=1428] Number two, here's a second prediction that I guarantee will happen.
[time=1434] In 1995 come with me for a minute to Psalm 103, verse 10 says this, "He has not dealt
[time=1451] with us according to our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities."
[time=1459] That was the first thing we talked about, God's unfailing commitment to forgive us of our sins and our iniquities.
[time=1466] You say why?
[time=1468] Why would God be that way towards us?
[time=1471] Psalm 103 then follows verse 10, look at verse 11, "For as high as the heavens are above
[time=1477] the earth so great is his loving kindness towards those who fear him.
[time=1483] As far as the east is from the west so far as he removed our transgressions from us, just as a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him.
[time=1493] Therefore he himself knows our frame.
[time=1496] He is mindful that we are but dust." The reason that God will forever continue to forgive your sins is because of his loving
[time=1505] kindness.
[time=1506] God loves you.
[time=1507] You can count on this thing in 1995, God will love you.
[time=1511] Every moment of every day God will be loving you in 1995.
[time=1518] There will not be a moment, there will not even be a fleeting second when the disposition of his heart will be anything other than absolute, total, unconditional love for who you are.
[time=1530] Now see, we get this twisted.
[time=1533] A lot of us aren't going to experience this.
[time=1535] I won't experience this in '95 as much as I should, even as we sang more, more love.
[time=1541] May I experience it and pray it into my life because we get the thing twisted.
[time=1546] We get the thing backwards.
[time=1548] Our Lord said this, "If you love me, keep my commandments." That's a true statement.
[time=1554] The indication of our love for him is our willingness to obey and follow.
[time=1560] But we twist that sentence around.
[time=1561] We make it no longer, "If you love me, keep my commandments." Somehow we twist it to say this, "I," speaking God speaking, "I will love you if you keep
[time=1571] my commandments.
[time=1574] I will love you if you keep my commandments." There's something that happened to us in the fall that brought shame and contempt deep into our soul, and we are forever misunderstanding the love of God.
[time=1588] Because even though we are redeemed and even though we're born again, there's this haunting voice that runs around inside our head that says, "By now, I should be."
[time=1598] In light of all that God has done in dying on the cross from my sins, in light of all that He has given me in my salvation, by this point I should be more mature.
[time=1606] I should have grown more.
[time=1608] I should be sinning less.
[time=1610] I should be more dedicated to Him.
[time=1612] And then the little phrase slips in, "I don't really deserve to be loved by God."
[time=1619] I don't really deserve to be loved by God.
[time=1623] Let me tell you something.
[time=1626] You're right.
[time=1628] You don't.
[time=1631] You don't deserve it one second of your life.
[time=1634] And neither do I.
[time=1635] Nothing I can do will ever be able to deserve the love and the affection that God has sovereignly
[time=1642] chosen to put on me and on my life and on you and on your life.
[time=1648] The worst thing we could possibly conceive of in our Christian lives is that because of His salvation, we'll somehow live more holy lives, we'll somehow live more sanctified lives, we'll be more dedicated, we'll give Him more of our time, we'll spend ourselves more completely and that this effort will somehow affect His love for us.
[time=1666] That is a lie.
[time=1668] That is not true.
[time=1670] That is a conditional understanding of love and God has no such condition on the love which He has sovereignly chose to place on you from before the foundation of the world.
[time=1679] You're right.
[time=1680] You don't deserve to be loved by God and neither do I.
[time=1683] Romans 5.8 says this, "God demonstrated His love towards us."
[time=1689] Then when we had earned some brownie points, when we had done some things that made us loveable know, it says towards us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for
[time=1701] us.
[time=1702] Do you understand?
[time=1705] He is so wonderful.
[time=1706] He is so awesome.
[time=1708] He is so amazing that He chose to place His love on us when we were sinners, alienated
[time=1716] from God, enemies of His.
[time=1719] Do you think that now because of His transforming love that you and I have done a few good things that we become more deserving of His love, that He has somehow obligated to love us differently than before when we were totally undeserving of it in the first place?
[time=1735] You see, that's what I'm saying.
[time=1738] I guarantee, I predict that God will love you every single day, every single second, every
[time=1745] single moment, every single instant of 1995.
[time=1751] And nothing you can do will be able to shake, separate, deter, diminish, or in any other
[time=1760] way detract God's single focused love on you as an individual.
[time=1767] Jeremiah 31-3, he says this, "I have loved you with a never-lasting love."
[time=1776] That does it, doesn't it?
[time=1777] I mean, that puts the whole issue at bay.
[time=1781] I have loved you with an ever-lasting love.
[time=1786] It means before time began, I was loving you.
[time=1789] And now that time and space are here, I am loving you.
[time=1792] And when time and space are over, I will be loving you and it is independent of you.
[time=1798] It is because of what I am.
[time=1799] What does the Bible say?
[time=1800] God is love.
[time=1808] I remember the special, unique sense of the love of God in my life as I was sitting in
[time=1814] that crazy cement truck in the middle of Los Angeles somewhere in 1980, I think was the
[time=1820] year when I actually got saved, and this powerful demonstration of God's love coming
[time=1827] into my life when I was a sinner.
[time=1830] And by that, in my thinking, I am saying when I was still in the midst of enormous ungodliness,
[time=1838] practicing it in my life.
[time=1841] And somehow in the cab of that cement truck, God filled it with His love and gave me a sense that it was a love that was not conditioned upon my behavior.
[time=1850] But what a struggle it is now that I have been saved to maintain that same sense of
[time=1857] His unconditional love.
[time=1860] Somehow I want it to depend on me.
[time=1862] Somehow I want it to depend on what I have done.
[time=1864] Somehow I want it to depend on me being worthy or me deserving it.
[time=1868] Yes, it is true.
[time=1869] I need to respond to it by obeying His commandments.
[time=1871] But I cannot affect one bit His love in my life.
[time=1878] So in '95 you can count on two things, at least.
[time=1880] God will forgive you of your sins, and secondly, God will love you.
[time=1888] Number three, come to Philippians 1 for a minute.
[time=1899] It says in verse six that you can count on in 1995, God will transform you.
[time=1915] God will transform you.
[time=1918] God will continue to make you into the image of His Son.
[time=1923] It says in Philippians 1, 6, "For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you were perfected until the day of Jesus Christ.
[time=1932] Not only will He forgive you, every moment of every day, not only will He love you and
[time=1938] feel strong sense of affection and attachment to you, every day of '95, He will moment by
[time=1946] moment be working to transform you into the likeness of His Son.
[time=1952] Every moment of every day God will be working to prepare you to meet His Son face to face.
[time=1957] Every moment of every day in '95 God will be keeping this particular promise that He who began it will complete it.
[time=1965] Even when you have given up on being like Christ in '95, even when you hit those low spots where you would rather compromise and give up on the process of sanctification and
[time=1977] bow down to the God of this age and involve yourself in things and in activities and thoughts and hopes and dreams and aspirations which are not consistent with God's plan, in His word for your life, when you have given up God will work for your transformation.
[time=1995] He will be at work in your life.
[time=1997] Romans 8 tells us that He can cause even those bad things, even those hard things.
[time=2002] He can cause everything to work together for your good, for your transformation.
[time=2007] Could you imagine how ridiculous it would be?
[time=2012] If you saw a little fuzzy caterpillar out there in the forest and if you and the caterpillar
[time=2018] could talk, you notice that the caterpillar is rubbing up against trees and then he finds color for flowers and he's able to rub his body against the colorful flowers and you're curious about this.
[time=2029] So you go up to him and you say, "Little, Mr. Caterpillar, what are you doing?"
[time=2035] And the caterpillar says, "Well, I really want to be transformed into a butterfly." And it's pretty much up to me to get the job done.
[time=2042] So somehow I've got to get rid of this ugly furry thing and somehow I've got to get some beautiful colors all over me.
[time=2048] I don't know where I'm going to get my wings but I'm going to get it done.
[time=2054] It's ridiculous, isn't it?
[time=2055] You know who's going to transform that caterpillar into a butterfly?
[time=2060] God is.
[time=2062] God is because that's what He does.
[time=2065] He's in the transformation business.
[time=2068] And you and I sit down here and think that we are going to get ourselves all transformed
[time=2074] into the image of Jesus Christ and that it's all up to us and so we best find some trees to rub up against them.
[time=2080] We best find some leaves to get some color off of so we can start to look like it.
[time=2084] We are forgetting the fundamental principle that underlies all our understanding of how we are transformed, how we are truly changed.
[time=2093] It is God.
[time=2095] It is God from beginning to end and it is His plan and it is His idea and He will see
[time=2101] it through.
[time=2104] He can use everything in your life, your home, your relationships, your church, your job, your health, any calamity at all, drawing it all back together for your transformation
[time=2114] and He will do it every single second, every single instant in '95.
[time=2123] He's going to forgive you in '95, He's going to love you in '95, He's going to transform you in '95 and I like this one a lot.
[time=2133] Come with me to Psalm 139, Psalm 139, God is going to understand you in 1995.
[time=2152] Psalm 139, verses 1 to 6, you follow along as I read it.
[time=2161] Listen to what He's saying to us through David who knew this in his own experience.
[time=2166] Oh Lord, Thou hast searched me and known me.
[time=2173] Thou dost know when I sit down and when I rise up.
[time=2176] Thou dost understand my thought from afar.
[time=2180] Thou dost scrutinize my path and my laying down and are intimately acquainted with all
[time=2186] my ways.
[time=2188] Even before there is a word on my tongue, behold, oh Lord, Thou dost know it all.
[time=2194] Thou hast enclosed me behind and before and laid thy hand upon me.
[time=2198] Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[time=2201] It is too high.
[time=2203] I cannot attain to it.
[time=2206] Do you realize that every single moment of every single day in 1995 God will have a deep
[time=2214] personal, intimate understanding of everything you are thinking, everything you are feeling,
[time=2223] everything you are experiencing?
[time=2227] He will know it all, He will understand it all.
[time=2231] There will never be a time in 95 when He will go on vacation from this commitment.
[time=2237] There will never be a time when He is distracted where I have to kind of pick the storyline up again in your life.
[time=2242] Wonder, oh yeah, how is Russell doing?
[time=2246] How is Bob doing?
[time=2248] I've been away from that a little bit.
[time=2250] There will never be a time when this priority will be preempted by another priority or some
[time=2258] incredible thing going on in the kingdom of God will distract him from the complete personal total, intimate understanding of who you are and what you're doing and what you're feeling and what you're thinking.
[time=2269] He will know when you sit down.
[time=2270] He will know at the moment you, He will know when you are sitting down is what that means.
[time=2274] He will know when, not only when you have stood up, but when you are standing up.
[time=2279] He will know and understand your thoughts from afar, which means before you get to them He understands them.
[time=2285] He will, I love it, He will scrutinize your path.
[time=2289] He will carefully inspect, understand, know all about your path and you're lying down.
[time=2296] He will hear every word that comes off your tongue.
[time=2300] He will never be too busy to listen to the rest of your sentence or hear the complaint in your heart or hear the sadness that fills you.
[time=2307] He'll hear every single one of them, those you utter and those you don't utter.
[time=2312] You will indeed be intimately acquainted with all your ways.
[time=2318] Over in Psalm 8 the psalmist says, "What is man that thou dost take thought of him?
[time=2327] And the son of man that thou dost care for him?" That's a great question.
[time=2334] Why should he bother, is the point?
[time=2336] What are we, this earthen clay, these sinful human beings?
[time=2340] What are we that God should be so interested in us?
[time=2344] Do you have people asking you to get interested in things in their life that you don't really care about, that you could live without, that you'd rather just step aside on?
[time=2354] God is never that way with you.
[time=2356] He is always interested in how you're feeling and thinking about going back to school.
[time=2362] What's your feeling and thinking about your job?
[time=2365] What's your feeling and thinking about your home, your friends, your self?
[time=2370] And he's even interested in what you're feeling and thinking about him.
[time=2378] No matter how ugly it gets, no matter how petty you become, no matter how bad, no matter how worrisome you become, God will know and understand everything in your life.
[time=2388] He will never back away.
[time=2392] Number five, he will not only understand you, he will guide you, he will guide you.
[time=2402] Come forward just to Proverbs 3 for a minute.
[time=2406] Listen to these wonderful words, this tremendous promise for your life in 95.
[time=2412] God will not only understand every single dimension of your thoughts, your life, your mind, your heart, your emotions, he will guide you through 95.
[time=2423] He says in Proverbs 3 verse 5, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean
[time=2430] on your own understanding.
[time=2432] In all your ways, acknowledge him.
[time=2434] Why?
[time=2435] Because he will make your paths straight.
[time=2439] God is longing and seeking and available and capable and willing to lead and guide you through
[time=2445] the next year." Rather verse 7, "Do not be wise in your own eyes, fear the Lord and turn away from evil it will be healing to your body and refreshment to your bones, honor the Lord with your wealth and from the first of your produce," et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2461] Add to that James 1.5 which says, "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God who gives to all men generously, all men liberally and without reproach and it will be given to him." Yes, every moment of every day in 1995 God will be extending to you his guidance, the
[time=2479] guidance that you need through his written word, through the obvious open testimony of his written word, through the prompting of the Holy Spirit as you feel the Spirit of God leading and prompting you, through the insights of your close friends, your confidants and your counselors as there is wisdom and a multitude of counselors, through his sovereign
[time=2499] orchestration of the circumstances of your life, God will allow you to sense his direction and his leading in every single situation that comes your way in the coming year.
[time=2510] There will never be a time when you come to the crossroads of life, no matter how big
[time=2516] or how small, where God will withdraw his offer of guidance.
[time=2522] And as Tim's saying in Psalm 23, "He will be a shepherd to you and you shall not want.
[time=2531] He will lead you beside quiet waters.
[time=2533] He will guide you in the paths of righteousness.
[time=2536] And even though the psalmist says, "I may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil why, because thou art with me."
[time=2549] All your long Christ is going to be with you.
[time=2551] All your long Christ is going to have a hold of your hand.
[time=2554] All your long Christ is going to be involved in the affairs of your life seeking to give you the guidance and the wisdom that you need.
[time=2562] He will be prompting you and leading you and guiding you.
[time=2565] And you can count on this.
[time=2566] He will never ever lead you into being tempted beyond what you are able.
[time=2573] He will never lead you into a compromising situation where you are not capable of resisting the temptation, which brings us to our sixth point.
[time=2583] The sixth thing that you can count on as a faithful prediction for 1995, God will strengthen
[time=2589] you.
[time=2591] God will strengthen you every single moment in every single day.
[time=2598] God will be supplying the strength that you need to live to His glory and to His honor.
[time=2606] Through every trial, through every hardship, through every difficult situation, God will be providing the power for you to live to His honor and it's all His responsibility.
[time=2617] He says in 2 Peter 1 verse 2, "Grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." Now listen to this, "Seeing that His divine power has granted to us everything pertaining
[time=2632] to life and godliness through the true knowledge of Him who called us by His own glory and excellence." Do you realize that it is God's power that is at work within you?
[time=2644] That is not true of an unbeliever, that is not true of someone who doesn't know Christ.
[time=2650] That's why Paul in Ephesians 1 says this, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened." He says, "I want you to be able to see with your heart where the center of your being is, I want you to see down deep in a meaningful way.
[time=2662] The eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you may know what is the surpassing greatness of His power towards us who believe." Isn't that interesting that Paul spends time praying for the saints at Ephesus?
[time=2675] And the prayer comes out this way, "Oh God, open their eyes, the eyes of their heart so that they can perceive and know the surpassing greatness of your power in their life."
[time=2687] Because we are constantly underestimating it, we are constantly minimizing it, we are constantly shifting off the power of God, onto the power of self, self will, self-determination,
[time=2697] will power.
[time=2698] And while that certainly plays a part in the Christian life, what you find Paul praying for over and over and over again in people's lives is that they would understand the power
[time=2709] of God in their life, the divine resource that is there.
[time=2713] He goes on in Ephesians 1, "It's the same power as He brought about in Christ when He raised Him from the dead, the same power that He used as He seated Him at the right hand of God, the same power that He used as He put Christ far above all rule and authority
[time=2726] and power and dominion, the same power that He used when He gave Christ a name for all the ages and put everything in subjection under His feet.
[time=2735] That is the power that God will supply in your life.
[time=2740] There will never be a time when you, as it were, step on the accelerator of your car and nothing happens, God will respond.
[time=2749] There will never be a time when you flip on the light switch and it remains dark, when you're seeking the source of power and none is delivered, God will stand by you each and
[time=2759] every moment of the coming year and provide for you the power and the strength to live
[time=2765] for His glory.
[time=2770] You'll stay the course to run the race to finish the assignment.
[time=2776] Well as we wrap this up, here they are, the first six, my predictions for 1995, here's
[time=2782] what God's going to do in your life.
[time=2784] God is going to forgive you and I just, I can't get over that one.
[time=2789] God is going to love you.
[time=2792] God is going to transform you.
[time=2794] God is going to understand you.
[time=2797] God is going to guide you.
[time=2799] God is going to empower you and now number seven, God will seek your worship.
[time=2809] God will seek your worship.
[time=2811] Come with me to John 4 just as we close.
[time=2819] God's going to do a lot of things in 1995.
[time=2827] John 4 tells us that one of them is that He will faithfully.
[time=2833] He will consistently.
[time=2835] Every moment of every day in 1995, God will be seeking people who will worship Him in spirit
[time=2842] and in truth.
[time=2846] John 4 verse 23 says there, "But an hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers
[time=2855] shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth for such people the Father seeks to be
[time=2863] His worshipers, to be His worshipers."
[time=2871] Not a moment, not a second, not an instant, will go by in this coming year when God will
[time=2881] not want to be worshiped by you.
[time=2888] He's going to want it from you everywhere you go.
[time=2892] Every place you are, everything you do, when you go to work He wants you to worship Him
[time=2899] on the way to work.
[time=2900] Have the sense of His presence, have the sense that this is His day, have the sense that you are His servant, have the sense that He will guide and will empower and will love and will forgive and offer that up to Him all the way there, maybe not even in a sense of conscious repetition, but just the awareness that you are worshiping God.
[time=2918] This is the life that He has given you and you will live it to His honor and to His glory.
[time=2927] I think we ought to give it to Him.
[time=2929] I think the one thing in response that we ought to give to a God who is so magnanimous and so faithful and so gracious is that we really truly ought to give Him all the worship
[time=2940] we can muster.
[time=2943] There's a guy in the Old Testament who got to find out what the coming year would hold
[time=2949] in His life.
[time=2950] I mean, God told them pretty much all about it.
[time=2954] God said that your homeland there, your country men, the Israelites, Judah, you're going to
[time=2961] be invaded by a foreign army.
[time=2965] This army, by the way, is the one I have raised up for this very purpose and they are described in lethal terms.
[time=2972] They are a fighting machine.
[time=2974] They are vicious.
[time=2975] They are killers.
[time=2976] They are effective.
[time=2977] They are powerful.
[time=2978] They are unstoppable and they will run you over and it will completely alter your life as
[time=2984] you know it.
[time=2986] God told Him all this in advance but the prophet Habakkuk said in response, "Though the fig
[time=2994] tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines, though the yield of the olives
[time=3000] should fail and the fields produce no food, though the flock should be cut off from the
[time=3006] fold and there be no cattle in the stalls." You see, that is His response.
[time=3009] That is the destitution of His homeland, of His family, of His people.
[time=3015] If God is told in that and He says, "All right, so that's coming," let me give you my response.
[time=3021] Habakkuk says, "Yet I will exalt in the Lord.
[time=3025] I will exalt in the Lord.
[time=3027] I will rejoice in the God of my salvation.
[time=3031] The Lord God is my strength and He has made my feet like Heinz feet and makes me walk on
[time=3039] high places."
[time=3047] With your heads bowed this morning, you don't know what 95 brings.
[time=3054] I mean the specifics, the particulars.
[time=3057] For you that may be one of your best years circumstantially, God may bless your business, He may bless your family, He may bless your endeavors.
[time=3065] He may satisfy longings that you've wanted for years in ways you'd never dream possible.
[time=3073] And surely you will worship Him for that.
[time=3077] At the same time, you and I must both reckon that 95 may be one of the hardest years.
[time=3083] For some of you, it may mean cancer.
[time=3086] It may mean a heart problem.
[time=3088] It may mean the death of a child.
[time=3092] It may mean the loss of a loved one through separation or divorce.
[time=3095] It may mean the loss of your reputation.
[time=3097] It may mean unbelievable things.
[time=3102] I'm asking you at the beginning of 1995, based on the goodness of God, based upon who
[time=3113] He is and what He has said He will do, the fact that He will forgive you for anything you do, the fact that He will love you, the fact that He will transform you, the fact that He will understand you and guide you and empower you.
[time=3125] I am asking you to covenant right now with God to be like Habakkuk and say, "Yet I will
[time=3136] exalt Him."
[time=3142] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, this would seem to be the only response to you.
[time=3150] Love and love and adoration.
[time=3154] Lord, we do trust you for our future.
[time=3157] We sit here in the beginning of a new year.
[time=3160] Many of us can look back a number of years that you have been the Savior and Lord of our life and we have seen you.
[time=3167] We have tasted you.
[time=3169] We have found you to be true.
[time=3172] You are a great and loving God.
[time=3174] But Lord, we do not presume upon your continued extension of circumstantial blessing in our
[time=3180] life.
[time=3183] And so we vow this morning, regardless of what life will bring, to worship you all of 95.
[time=3192] Each and every day we will bring to you as a loving, sweet-smelling sacrifice that the
[time=3200] aroma of our life might be pleasing to you, that what you seek in 95, you will find people
[time=3210] who worship you in spirit and in truth.
[time=3214] We pray these things in Christ name.
[time=3217] [AMEN] Let me invite you to stand as Tim comes and leads us in a closing song.
[time=3227] In 1979, take my life led me, take my life and let it be, comes the great Lord to thee.
[time=3248] Take my moment, send my days, let them flow in ceaseless praise, let them flow in ceaseless
[time=3266] praise on the last verse, take my love, my Lord I pour and I feed it's treasure store.
[time=3282] Take myself and I will thee ever only all for thee, ever only all for thee.
[time=3312] You know what an exciting thing to know that without even understanding all the details that are going to come our way in 1995, we don't know the circumstances, we don't know what life is going to bring, but we do know that there is a God who is going to act in a certain way towards us, regardless of our behavior.
[time=3331] And I guess I just need to add a footnote to that message.
[time=3334] I want you to know that everything I've said is true in the message on one condition and
[time=3340] that is that you have Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3344] If you've accepted Christ into your heart as your Lord and Savior, then everything I said about God forgiving you every day and loving you every day and leading and guiding and transforming and empowering, all that's true.
[time=3358] But if you don't have Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, none of it's true.
[time=3362] Oh, it's true that he'll love you as he loves the world, but forgiveness comes only through
[time=3369] Christ.
[time=3371] The transforming work that changes you into someone you want to become, that comes only
[time=3377] through the forgiveness that comes through Christ.
[time=3382] It may be that you've never accepted Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, in which case all those predictions, all seven of them, you cannot count on.
[time=3391] However, if God is working in your heart now and you sense the need to be saved, you sense the desire to get right with God and to have those predictions, your predictions,
[time=3402] then you could pray with me right now and you can ask God to save you through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3407] I'm going to bow my head in just a minute and pray that prayer that would lead you and as I say it out loud, I invite you to say it quietly in your heart to God.
[time=3416] If you want to say it out loud, it doesn't matter.
[time=3418] If you mean the prayer, God will hear it and God will answer it and God will save you.
[time=3423] If you'd like to pray now, bow your head with me.
[time=3428] Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3431] I know that I have violated your divine law, that I deserve death and hell, but I also
[time=3437] know from your word how you want to treat me, that you want to forgive me, that you want to love me intimately as one of your children, that you want to transform me, that you want to give me power and guidance and all the things that we've talked about today.
[time=3452] I know that I can have those only through Jesus Christ, and so I ask Him to be my Lord and my Savior, to forgive me of my sins.
[time=3460] I put my faith in Christ as my Savior.
[time=3464] Thank you, God, for hearing my prayer and for saving me.
[time=3467] [AMEN] Well, I'll tell you what, if you prayed that prayer and you meant it from your heart, things are different in your life now because of that, and we'd love to help you grow in your relationship with Christ.
