[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=11] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=13] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=14] Few things in life are as welcomed as good news.
[time=18] It's wonderful when someone approaches you with the good news that things are gonna be positive in the future.
[time=24] Well, today we take a good look at the best news of all, the power of God and salvation.
[time=30] There's no better news that could ever be shared than the fact that God has made a way of salvation.
[time=36] Stay with us today, as Pastor Moore gives us the good news.
[time=40] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 326 seconds]
[time=382] (audience clapping) - Hi, my name's Russell Moore,
[time=406] and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=410] As we begin a new study in one of the books of God's Word, we start the book of Colossians.
[time=415] It's a tremendous book that'll put Christ on display, as he distinguishes himself from legalism and philosophy and asceticism, and a number of cults when they were in their infant stages back in the early church.
[time=428] It'll speak to us about our family lives, husband and wife relationships, and children and employer employee.
[time=433] It should be a great study, and I want to encourage you to join us for the entire time as we move through this over the next several months.
[time=439] If we can answer any questions as we go along, please don't hesitate to give us a call or write us a note.
[time=445] We'd be happy to answer any of your Bible questions.
[time=447] We open this morning with a section on the Gospel, which is called The Good News, and we'll be talking about some of the great news that relates to the Gospel as it ties into Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=459] We've had a tremendous Christmas season.
[time=461] As you know, we want to thank you for your prayers.
[time=463] Financially, our church has just seen God's hand at work.
[time=467] We have been running a little bit more behind than normal as we were coming into the month of December.
[time=473] In fact, we were about $79,000 behind on budget, and we put before our people a year in, giving opportunity, a special Christmas offering, and it's just amazed us what has occurred.
[time=484] The Christmas offering was $94,000.
[time=486] It's the largest in the history of our church, and it's taken us from being almost $80,000 behind to about $25,000 in front, which is where we typically need to be to finish our year in June 31 in the Black.
[time=498] So I share this with you because God has shared it with us, and I know you pray for us, and I know you're committed to us, and you rejoice as we rejoice, and it is marvelous news.
[time=507] The other thing I want to ask your help in, and for you to be praying for us, is as we anticipate a brand new service in the life of our church ministry here at Black Hawk.
[time=516] It's an outreach service designed specifically for unbelievers, and on Sunday morning of all times.
[time=523] We're going to be taking our Sunday morning service January 29, both hours, to present the gospel as it relates to finding hope
[time=532] in God when your life is falling apart.
[time=534] We'll be doing some unique things.
[time=536] It'll be a little different than our normal format.
[time=538] We're very excited about it and very hopeful.
[time=540] You could just help by praying that God will allow our programming to go well, those who are participating in the service to be blessed of God, and pray too for the people in our church as they reach out to unsaved friends, as much as we do through the living Christmas tree.
[time=554] That God will open these unsaved friends' hearts and draw them into our service and allow the gospel to penetrate their heart and that they would find Christ, be saved, and start growing in the things of God.
[time=567] I trust you're excited about the things that are going on in your life with Christ, what God is doing, that you're faithfully serving and ministering His truth and His love.
[time=576] We pray for you often, we don't always know who to pray for, but it's often I'll pray for the people who support us and watch us.
[time=582] God bless you, and now back to the normal portion of our program.
[time=586] [MUSIC] Leading in the darkness [MUSIC] The cell was cold and black [MUSIC] Driven to unconsciousness [MUSIC] By the strikes upon His back [MUSIC] He heard a voice calling out His name [MUSIC] His mind began to clear [MUSIC] And in the darkness He replied [MUSIC] Silas I am here [MUSIC]
[time=628] [MUSIC - 232 seconds]
[time=870] [APPLAUSE]
[time=876] [MUSIC - 38 seconds]
[time=921] Lord Jesus Jesus, thank you.
[time=924] This morning that your strength is perfect.
[time=927] 'Cause there are a lot of days, maybe for a lot of us, it's today, when we don't feel very strong.
[time=934] And when the sea storms of life are just beating us up, God is so good to know that there is a Savior in whom we can trust.
[time=942] There is a Lord who is still in control, and that when our strength is weak, yours is still still strong.
[time=948] And we are raised in your power.
[time=951] We praise you for that this morning, God.
[time=954] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=957] â™ª
[time=967] Thank you, Tim.
[time=969] Colossians, chapter one.
[time=973] The passage we're going to look at this morning is about what we call the gospel, what was originally just called the good news.
[time=985] This word in the original Greek, you'll find it in your text there about verse five, is, if I can say it right, verse two on Gellion is the way they said it in the Greek.
[time=997] And the best way I can get you to get the original understanding of what that was all about, do you remember when we were going to war in the Gulf, and there was this massive buildup of troops, eventually 500,000 of our American soldiers were there, and you continued to hear reports that yet another aircraft carrier had gone down there, and another battleship had gone down there, and there were literally thousands of Tomahawk missiles, American missiles there with enough nuclear explosives between those and what was carried in the jets to absolutely annihilate the world.
[time=1031] And there were, at that time, an unknown estimated number of soldiers under Saddam Hussein's control.
[time=1038] We didn't know if he was ready for chemical warfare, and we didn't know if he had nuclear warfare.
[time=1043] Do you remember the tension and the trauma that came with that buildup?
[time=1048] I do. It captivated my thinking.
[time=1052] I, of course, was afraid of another Vietnam, as I think the whole country was, and what we didn't want to do was go into another situation and have this long drawn out, seemingly endless, undefined, pointless experience of carnage.
[time=1066] And I remember, clear than that, the relief that I felt when the first word came back from the battlefield.
[time=1074] And it came back, you know, in living color, because it's the age of the satellite disk and television, all that stuff, and we could actually begin to understand that not only had the battle begun, but we had just had unbelievable advances that victory was certain, that it was just a landslide thing, and that the Schwarzkopf and all his troops had just annihilated a whole bunch of defense places and people and that was under control and we were going to win.
[time=1102] You and I have never had to have that kind of trauma and tension build in relationship to our own homeland since the Civil War, obviously.
[time=1110] No one inside of the American borders has ever been threatened personally with war.
[time=1114] We have fought them on foreign shores.
[time=1116] And so we have a difficult understanding, really appreciating the level of tension that would have built in the ancient world, because that often was not the case.
[time=1125] They would have their little city state or their home state, and they'd have a wall that would try to protect them, and they would get win that a foreign army was on its way, and they would oftentimes send their men out into battle to try to win the victory out there.
[time=1137] And then, while their loved ones had gone to fight, they would just sit there and wait.
[time=1142] And there would be no communication, no TV, no radio, no letters, no telegraph, no nothing, just nothing, just wait and wait and wait, and the news they were expecting was either going to be on the horizon, the enemy, because they had defeated their loved ones, their home troops, and the enemy was now going to come and rape and pillage and steal and ruin and burn, or they were going to get EU on Gallion. They were going to get the good news, which was the way that word was originally used.
[time=1172] The messenger from your army would come back and burst into the city and say, "Everything's going to be okay. We're winning." Or, "We have won, and they are on their way back." And if that gets you anywhere near the excitement of what is in the heart of the Apostle Paul when he says there is the Gospel, there is the good news.
[time=1197] And as I was thinking about this week at dawn on me, that the best news I have ever received has always been related to the Gospel.
[time=1205] You know, there was some really good news when Heidi said yes, there was some more good news when we started having kids, I don't know, somewhere that almost became bad news.
[time=1213] No, but you know, there was all that good news, and that's wonderful stuff, right?
[time=1218] But the best news I've ever had was when I was sitting
[time=1224] in a cement truck in the middle of Los Angeles, and God made it very clear to me that I could be saved, that the battle with sin could be over, that the destruction and the carnage of my life as I was living it and would have spent eternity being punished for, that that battle was over and that I could be saved.
[time=1244] And it is now, it is my memory as the greatest joy, and what comes to me honestly as the greatest joy in my life, time and time and time and time again, is when other people get saved.
[time=1256] Because it allows me to feel again afresh in a new, that special sense, you know, right when you got saved.
[time=1262] I'm forgiven.
[time=1264] Without a question, we had the best new years that we've ever had.
[time=1269] I mean the Christmas holiday with the tree, and then we had a great time with Heidi's folks, and God was really good there, we enjoyed our time, and then the new year, but you know, above and beyond everything, you know, the sweetest moment that sticks out in my mind as the greatest, most meaningful thing that happened all through the holidays was on Christmas Eve, and we were all having communion in this place, and back here in this corner, there was a couple, and I won't name them because I don't want to embarrass them, but I've already encouraged them with this.
[time=1296] We had the privilege of leading them to the Lord about six months ago, discipling them ever since. They've been in the baptismal.
[time=1302] They're rooted and grounded in their faith, they're growing, they're taking action, and in the midst of all the wonder of that beautiful communion service, I happened to look up and just see them, and there was a flood of joy, a flood of, this is what life is about.
[time=1318] There's a couple who, just like me, was headed for hell, was destroying their life, was being ruined by Satan, and now because the good news of the gospel has penetrated, made sense, taken hold, they're here, and they have meaning, and they have purpose, and they have a reason to live, and a way to live.
[time=1338] The best news always comes around the gospel.
[time=1344] We've got some really good, some more, really good news about the gospel, by the way.
[time=1349] Remember last time I was talking to you about living proof?
[time=1352] It was about a month ago. It was the last Sunday you could sign up for living proof, I mean by way of the tables in the foyer, and I said there are 320 people that have already signed up, well that was good news in and of itself.
[time=1363] I mean we were expecting 50 or 60 or 100 or something, and on a lark, Dick Kelly and I checked out all the available meeting spaces on this side of the campus and that side of the campus, and we could, at that time we thought, could handle no more than 400 people.
[time=1376] Remember what I told you today?
[time=1378] So I said if you're going to sign up, sign up today.
[time=1380] Well 100 people signed up that day.
[time=1382] So that was 420, which sent Dick scrambling and now we found new spaces.
[time=1386] And then we found out that the college impact class also wants to go through living proof, and they've got 30 people they're going to take through on Tuesday nights.
[time=1395] And so there's like 450 of us in our first opportunity to kind of respond
[time=1401] and say hey we want to be a part of evangelism, we want to see people come to Christ.
[time=1405] And I know others of you probably would have been willing to sign up, maybe didn't fit your schedule or whatever it was.
[time=1410] I hope you recognize that as an enormous tidal wave of response by the people of our church.
[time=1416] That's really good news.
[time=1418] By the way, when they went back and looked at all the available spaces that now, as of right now, we still have three meeting spaces.
[time=1424] So if you want to, you know, ruin Dick Kelly's day, give him a call and say we'd like to come.
[time=1429] It's not too late, you can still be a part.
[time=1432] Remember when we had that last annual meeting or business meeting
[time=1438] and we voted in vision 2002 and then I got up and said well now we are in the enviable position of knowing exactly where we want to go but having no idea how we're going to get there?
[time=1448] This is part of how we're going to get there.
[time=1450] God is just going to do things, apparently, that baffle the mind, that are unprecedented, that are unique, that are ridiculous in some sense.
[time=1458] 450 people wanting to be trained, excited.
[time=1464] You're in giving special projects.
[time=1467] I'm humbled by the whole thing. It's great news.
[time=1469] It's great news because it all goes back to the gospel.
[time=1472] It all goes back to that couple back there in the corner.
[time=1476] And there's just hundreds of them, just like them, that we believe God would have us reach, establish in the gospel and help them reach others.
[time=1485] And in the process, get stronger ourselves and get more excited about Christ and become all that God would have us become.
[time=1493] So that's good news.
[time=1496] Now the good news we want to talk about this morning is how it happened at Colossae.
[time=1501] And I'm going to give you seven aspects of the good news as it comes out of this passage.
[time=1506] And I don't know about you if you'll have this experience, but when I went through this passage, I felt myself with like a renewed appreciation for what God does in salvation.
[time=1515] I didn't really learn anything new.
[time=1517] There wasn't any like breathtaking new deep theology or some insight.
[time=1520] It was just no kidding.
[time=1522] Oh yeah, that's right.
[time=1524] That is how marvelous God is to us in salvation, in the good news.
[time=1530] So this morning, just seven aspects of the gospel or the good news.
[time=1534] Number one, the gospel is personalized through faith.
[time=1537] Let me start up in verse one, even though where we're going to stop is in verse four.
[time=1541] Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God and Timothy, our brother, to the saints and faithful brother in Christ who are at Colossae.
[time=1549] That's pretty typical.
[time=1550] In our day, we sign the letter at the end.
[time=1552] In their day, they signed it at the front, kind of told you who was with them, addressed the thing to the Colosses and then this greeting of warmth at the in verse two, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father." Then he kind of gets in a little bit to his letter.
[time=1567] Verse three, "We give thanks to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you.
[time=1573] Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints, saints, you can stop right there." You see, the gospel is good news.
[time=1582] The gospel is the reality that God, in his mercy and in his goodness, has chosen to provide a way of salvation for people who are as sinful and who are as undeserving and who are as rebellious and ungodly as we are.
[time=1597] That is the good news.
[time=1600] But it is true that that good news does not become good news to you
[time=1606] as an individual until you apprehend Christ by faith.
[time=1612] It is personalized.
[time=1613] It becomes your good news.
[time=1615] It becomes something that impacts your life and your eternity because you take a hold of the person of Christ through the hands of faith and accept them into your life.
[time=1625] Everyone does not do that.
[time=1628] Of the gospel and of the faith that says in Galatians 1-7 that some pervert the gospel.
[time=1633] Some people hear the gospel and instead of taking it into themselves they pervert it.
[time=1637] They change it.
[time=1638] They warp it.
[time=1639] They're false teachers and false prophets and cults.
[time=1641] And they say, "No, you've got to work your way to heaven." It's not just Christ.
[time=1646] In Romans 10 it says, "There's another reaction to the gospel.
[time=1649] Some disobey the gospel." And that is what everybody does, who doesn't submit to Christ, who doesn't upon hearing it fall down and prostrate themselves and say, "Please save me and you are now my Lord." Any reaction short of that is disobeying the gospel.
[time=1665] But here in Colossians 1 he is rejoicing that this little group of people in this little town called Colossae, when they heard the good news they put their faith in Christ.
[time=1675] They personalized it.
[time=1678] They brought it from an intellectual understanding to a personal salvation.
[time=1682] Obviously, winter is finally here.
[time=1685] There are good things and bad things about that.
[time=1687] Saturday was a particularly beautiful day I felt as you woke and saw the beautiful snow everywhere.
[time=1692] It's finally cold enough.
[time=1693] We got some freezing going on and the kids were excited so they put on all their snow stuff and went outside in the backyard.
[time=1699] And as you know, or may not know, we happen to have a pool in our backyard and these pools will tend to freeze in the winter.
[time=1706] And by the time I got outdoors, Randy, my eldest daughter, was sitting on the edge of the pool and had scraped away the snow that had built up on the ice.
[time=1714] And I saw her kicking the ice with the heel of her snow boot.
[time=1718] She was checking that out.
[time=1719] She says, "Dad, what do you think?
[time=1721] Should I walk out there?" And I go, "I don't know." They say ice has to be two to three inches thick before it will hold your weight.
[time=1728] Now I think I remember that right and I wasn't sure, but I'd hoped.
[time=1732] And so she kind of looks down there and because she's young and energetic and I'm young and energetic, we said, "Yeah, go for it." But there was that moment, you know, the moment before you take your weight off the edge of the pool and stand up totally and completely putting your weight on the ice.
[time=1750] And we kind of looked at each other and then she grinned and stood up.
[time=1754] And then she fell right.
[time=1755] No, that's not true.
[time=1756] Just kidding.
[time=1758] It held.
[time=1761] Walked around a little bit.
[time=1762] And I coaxed her over and said, "Get out.
[time=1763] Let's not do that anymore." You know, because that is that you're a little nervous.
[time=1767] Now that is what it means to put your faith in Christ.
[time=1769] That is a perfect picture of what it means to put your faith in Christ.
[time=1774] It's one thing to dust the, whatever it is, the misunderstandings off and get a clear look at it.
[time=1781] Who is this Jesus?
[time=1783] It's another thing to test it a little bit.
[time=1786] Look at some Christian's lives or come by a church and kind of knock on it a little bit and see, "Hey, what do you think about that?" It's even another thing to kind of visually examine it.
[time=1796] See if it's two inches thick.
[time=1798] Let me tell you something, friends.
[time=1799] You are not saved until you get your weight completely off the edge of the pool and stand
[time=1805] totally on the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1807] That is what it means to put your faith in Christ.
[time=1810] In fact, Acts 1631 says, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ."
[time=1816] And the preposition on represents putting your weight on the foundation of Christ.
[time=1823] So that is how the gospel comes into a person's life.
[time=1825] And that is the only way that the gospel enters into a person's life.
[time=1829] It is not the church you were born into.
[time=1830] It's not when you were baptized.
[time=1831] It's not when you walked forward.
[time=1832] It's not what your parents believed.
[time=1833] It's not that you own a Bible.
[time=1835] None of those things can personalize the good news into your life only when you stand up firmly and squarely with no contingency plan.
[time=1846] I mean, if the ice breaks, you're wet.
[time=1849] Stand on Christ for your life and for your eternity, the forgiveness of sins.
[time=1853] That's how it's personalized.
[time=1854] Now, number two, what does the gospel produce?
[time=1857] The gospel produces love.
[time=1859] Look at verse four.
[time=1860] Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints, and this really is good news.
[time=1867] Because do you realize that most of the people that you bump into all day long as you go about your life are isolated?
[time=1877] They are alone.
[time=1878] They are unloved.
[time=1880] Now, let me explain this for you.
[time=1881] Let me tell you why.
[time=1883] The people that you run into who don't know Christ, listen to what they don't have.
[time=1888] They have no God.
[time=1890] Now, they may have some belief in an ethereal, superior being or they may believe in like, you know, UFOs or whatever, but they don't have this God.
[time=1898] You understand this God that has revealed to us in the Word of God, Jehovah, the one of character, the one who is holy and righteous and just and compassionate and all knowing and all powerful.
[time=1906] They don't have a God like that.
[time=1907] They don't have a God.
[time=1908] There is no God.
[time=1909] Which means then there are no absolutes in their life.
[time=1912] There are no, there are no boundaries that are given to them by a higher being
[time=1918] that they are not allowed to go outside of, that they must remain inside of.
[time=1923] All of that is negotiable for them.
[time=1925] All of that is up to public opinion or personal opinion about public opinion and they will then fabricate their own personal guidelines which may be true today but may change tomorrow.
[time=1938] They also then have no Holy Spirit inside of them.
[time=1944] The divine resource that is not like pretend.
[time=1947] This is real stuff that God gives us when we get saved and it empowers us to continue to believe in that God and to continue to want to live inside those boundaries.
[time=1956] They don't have that either.
[time=1958] They also do not have you.
[time=1960] They don't have a church.
[time=1961] They don't have, I don't mean a building.
[time=1963] I mean people who believe in the same God, who believe in the same boundaries, the same power of God within them, who then in the ebb and flow of life hold each other up to live according to those divine principles.
[time=1976] So they are without that.
[time=1977] In fact they are full.
[time=1978] Their life is full of people who would pull them down to a lower level of life, who would encourage and build rationale and arguments to compromise the living by principle.
[time=1988] Now how do you build a significant meaningful relationship with someone that you cannot trust?
[time=1995] Do you get it?
[time=1996] You simply can't trust an unbeliever in the ultimate sense of the word, down here where you can really give your life away as we can give our lives away to each other.
[time=2007] Why?
[time=2008] Because for example, with Heidi, she has God in her life.
[time=2011] She has his absolutes.
[time=2012] She has his power.
[time=2014] She has you, this church.
[time=2016] All of that is the environment in which I can open my life to another individual.
[time=2021] Show them all that I am.
[time=2023] Trust them with all that I am and all that I'm not.
[time=2025] And know that tomorrow I'll be loved.
[time=2031] You don't have Christ.
[time=2032] You don't have the gospel.
[time=2033] You don't have that good news in your life.
[time=2035] You are living in degrees of isolation.
[time=2038] Now we know of unsafe people with marriages that last the full distance.
[time=2042] And we know of unbelieving relationships that have levels of sacrifice one for another.
[time=2046] But at the core of who they are, there is nothing of substance for them to believe
[time=2052] in that would allow the kind of Christian Cornonia to exist that becomes mainstay
[time=2059] and common fare in Christianity.
[time=2062] Hit his good news.
[time=2064] We, by the grace of God, are brought in, as it says, the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts.
[time=2071] As it says, we are to love fervently one another from the heart.
[time=2077] So the good news produces love.
[time=2079] Thirdly, it produces hope.
[time=2081] It produces hope.
[time=2083] Look at verse five, or let's go back to verse four and get to verse five.
[time=2086] Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love which you have for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you in heaven, of which you previously heard in the word of truth, the gospel.
[time=2100] What you and I have been given in this good news, the good news of the gospel to us is that we can reasonably and honestly
[time=2109] feel positively about our future.
[time=2113] I mean, there are real substantial reasons that you and I can, in the integrity of our heart, feel positive or optimistic about tomorrow.
[time=2126] Without the good news of the gospel, the only thing the future holds.
[time=2131] Now, it may hold some short-term gains for an unbeliever.
[time=2134] It may hold some short-term pleasures.
[time=2136] And there, I don't mean to minimize that.
[time=2139] Even the book of Hebrews says the passing pleasures of the season.
[time=2143] There is a level, a very temporary level of hope about tomorrow for many believers, whose lives are going right, unbelievers, for lives who are going right at that particular point in time.
[time=2155] But really, you strip all that away.
[time=2157] What they have to look forward to is aging, becoming sick, dying, and being eternally damned.
[time=2163] And they can't articulate that, maybe, many of them.
[time=2167] But God gives them the sense of it.
[time=2172] You and I have hope.
[time=2174] You and I know that while we may have some difficulties and while life may be hard, and yes, it's true, we're all going to age and many of us are going to become sick and short of the Lord's coming will all die.
[time=2187] But this process of living out the rest of life is lived with the purpose of God, who says I can cause it all to work together for your good.
[time=2194] A God who says, and by the way, it's all a part of my process of confirming you and perfecting you to be exactly like my son to spend eternity with me.
[time=2202] That is good news.
[time=2203] That is a news that the unbeliever simply doesn't have, doesn't know, doesn't understand.
[time=2209] I don't know if you had read anything about these hide-jackers.
[time=2212] You know over the Christmas holiday?
[time=2214] Air France, Air France flight number 8969.
[time=2218] I was intrigued by that. These four young Islamic fundamentalists jump on this plane with 227 passengers.
[time=2224] When they get there, the first thing they cry out is Allah is great.
[time=2228] Allah is great.
[time=2230] The next item on the agenda, now keep in mind you're hijacking a plane.
[time=2234] The next thing they do is they get out enough blankets to properly cover the heads of the women
[time=2241] because of their Islamic fundamentalist beliefs.
[time=2243] It is blasphemous for them or unholy for them to be in the presence of women whose heads are not properly covered.
[time=2251] The next thing they do is they start reciting verses from the Quran.
[time=2255] And when finally the negotiations begin between the authorities and them, these hijackers end every sentence in Iqala, God willing.
[time=2266] Do you understand?
[time=2267] You are not dealing with a bunch of weird, drug addict people who are trying to get money and living on the bottom edge of society.
[time=2273] You are dealing here with these four, we're dealing with these four young men, highly motivated, highly devout, highly religious Islamic fundamentalists.
[time=2282] And they believe that Allah was in their cause so much so that when the negotiators were able to identify at least one of these hijackers,
[time=2293] they got his mother.
[time=2295] And they said to the mother, can you plead with your son and plead she did?
[time=2300] Stop this, give up, don't do this.
[time=2304] And then this young Islamic said this.
[time=2308] "Mother, we will meet in paradise." Not true.
[time=2317] Not true.
[time=2319] And let me tell you this, it's not true.
[time=2322] He's not going to see her in paradise.
[time=2325] Not because they hijacked a plane.
[time=2330] And not because they killed some people in the process.
[time=2334] It is because they put their faith in Allah instead of Jehovah.
[time=2340] In Allah instead of Christ.
[time=2343] There is only one person in whom you can place your faith to find the hope
[time=2349] that is laid up for you in heaven and that is Jesus Christ.
[time=2352] It is not their sin that will keep them out of heaven, it is the specific sin of failing to put their faith in Christ that will keep them out of heaven.
[time=2361] And you know what?
[time=2362] You and I are walking around the streets of Fort Wayne with hundreds of people who are as diluted, who are as misunderstanding, who are as deceived
[time=2375] as to the reality of their soul, the condition of it and its future.
[time=2380] They are without hope.
[time=2382] But because of the gracious mercy of God in our lives, we are with hope.
[time=2386] One of the things the good news brings is hope.
[time=2390] Number four, it penetrates the world.
[time=2394] Another aspect of the gospel is that it penetrates the world.
[time=2397] Look at verse six.
[time=2400] The truth, the gospel which has come to you just as in all the world also.
[time=2405] In other words, the gospel didn't just come to these people at Colossae.
[time=2409] The gospel came and is intended to come and is appropriate for any and every person in the world.
[time=2416] God is not a bigot.
[time=2418] God is not a prejudice.
[time=2421] God looks past color, race, creed and all that stuff.
[time=2424] He just has a gospel that can extend and penetrate to every people, every tribe, every tongue.
[time=2429] And it's an amazing thing.
[time=2431] This morning after the morning service, a young man in his 20s came forward to be baptized.
[time=2436] And because of the message, I said what nationality are you?
[time=2439] And he said Korean.
[time=2441] God saves Koreans.
[time=2443] God saves Chinese.
[time=2445] He saves Filipinos.
[time=2446] He saves Japanese.
[time=2448] He saves people in Hong Kong and Mexico and Russia and Germany and Switzerland.
[time=2453] Those are the places that I personally have gone and met with Christians.
[time=2457] And though I couldn't speak their language, though I didn't like their food, though I didn't understand their culture, though I had really nothing in common with them.
[time=2465] Except the gospel because it transcends all those boundaries.
[time=2471] That's why Romans 1, 8 and 16 say the gospel went out into the whole world.
[time=2477] Everyone who believes Romans 10, the gospel sounded out into all the world.
[time=2483] 1 Thessalonians 1, 8, the gospel sounded forth in every place.
[time=2488] And Jesus in the gospel of John says I am the light of the world.
[time=2494] I'm it.
[time=2496] And so my gospel goes to everyone.
[time=2503] It's good news.
[time=2506] It's not as if there's a limited supply here.
[time=2508] It's not as if there's something that should cause us to stop from penetrating the whole world with the gospel.
[time=2514] Number five, the gospel perpetuates fruit.
[time=2520] I was thinking about this week, you know, that is my favorite food.
[time=2524] I mean, as far as just, it's amazing.
[time=2526] You know, meat, right?
[time=2527] You got to kill it.
[time=2528] Then you got to cut it.
[time=2531] You want some bread.
[time=2532] You got to grow it.
[time=2533] You got to, you know, you got to harvest it.
[time=2536] You got to crush it.
[time=2537] You got to put it in with some other stuff and cook it.
[time=2539] Then you get to eat it.
[time=2541] Vegetables.
[time=2542] A little bit less.
[time=2543] But you got to get out there.
[time=2544] You got to do all that stuff.
[time=2545] You got to clean it up.
[time=2546] You want some fruit?
[time=2547] Walk by a fruit tree.
[time=2549] Just pick.
[time=2550] Just pick and eat.
[time=2551] It's very simple.
[time=2552] Pick and eat.
[time=2553] And it's wonderful.
[time=2554] It's succulent.
[time=2555] It's satisfying.
[time=2556] I mean, God is saying that the gospel has the power to produce that kind of stuff in your
[time=2563] life.
[time=2564] When the gospel comes in contact with a life, it produces fruit.
[time=2568] It changes that life.
[time=2569] That's why one of my favorite passages, you don't need to turn there, is over in 1 Corinthians,
[time=2575] chapter 6.
[time=2577] It says, oh, do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?
[time=2583] Do not be deceived.
[time=2584] Now listen to all these people that don't get to go to heaven.
[time=2586] Foreignicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, homosexuals, thieves, the covetous, the drunkards,
[time=2592] the revilers, the swindlers, they shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[time=2596] Then he says, but such were some of you, but you were washed.
[time=2604] You were sanctified.
[time=2605] You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of God.
[time=2610] It's amazing.
[time=2611] What he's saying is when the gospel comes in contact with your life, though you were a fornicator and you were an idolater and an adulterous or an effeminate or a homosexual or a thief or a covetous or a drunkard or a reviler or a swindler, you see the gospel doesn't just save you.
[time=2627] It produces a change in your life and out of it now comes fruit, the fruit of love and the fruit of sacrifice and the fruit of self-discipline and the fruit of commitment and the fruit of staying within the boundaries of God.
[time=2638] I mean, it just comes out of your life and it's a blessing to God and to you and to the people who experience it, just like fruit from a tree.
[time=2647] It's so powerful.
[time=2649] The gospel is so powerful.
[time=2654] Number six, the provision is grace.
[time=2662] The provision of the gospel is grace.
[time=2667] Look at verse six, which has come to you just as in all the world, also it's constantly
[time=2674] bearing fruit and increasing even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard of it and understood the grace of God in truth.
[time=2684] That is amazing, you realize, don't you, that every single other religion in the world,
[time=2695] everybody else's way to heaven, whether they call it Nirvana or whether they call it this or that, everybody else's path to the state of eternal bliss is works.
[time=2709] That is the constant rule of thumb as you would study every single religion in the world.
[time=2717] You will find there it is done by man.
[time=2721] Now God may help at points, but God requires their God, requires man to work, to live in
[time=2728] such a way, to produce such a thing and in the process then to earn this state of eternal
[time=2735] bliss, Christianity, this thing, the gospel, the good news is that it's done by grace,
[time=2747] unmerited favor, it's a gift, you can't earn it.
[time=2752] Remember it this way, spell religion with two letters, DO.
[time=2759] Our religion with two letters, DO, religion is all about doing, religion is all about what
[time=2766] I got to do and what I can't do and when I got to do it and how often I got to do it.
[time=2770] Religion is all caught up in the word do, Christianity is caught up, spell that one this way, four letters, DO and E, done because it's the only religion in the world that is done.
[time=2783] All the price, all the penalty, all the sacrifice, all the atonement, all the redemption, all of it done in Christ, it's all grace.
[time=2796] Number seven, the seventh aspect of the gospel is as astounding as the previous six.
[time=2805] You know what about this good news?
[time=2806] God has left it to be proclaimed by people like you and me, people.
[time=2815] The gospel is proclaimed by people.
[time=2818] Look down there, verse seven, just as you learned it from who, a paphras, our beloved
[time=2825] fellow bondservant who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf, on our behalf and also informed us of your love and the spirit.
[time=2832] Now listen, what are you saying is you know how you got the gospel?
[time=2835] You know how come you could apprehend it by faith and let it produce love and let it engender hope and allow it to penetrate your world and produce fruit all by the grace of God.
[time=2845] You want to know how that whole thing got started in your life through one guy named a paphras.
[time=2850] Then you say, who is a paphras?
[time=2854] That's the point.
[time=2855] We don't know.
[time=2857] He's just a nobody.
[time=2861] He's not an apostle.
[time=2863] He's not a prophet.
[time=2865] He's not noted as an elder or a deacon or a teacher.
[time=2867] I mean maybe a teacher because he communicated the truth but different probably than the office of a teacher.
[time=2873] He's just an average, ordinary, normal guy like you, like me.
[time=2880] Now listen to this, Paul never went to Colossians.
[time=2884] Paul never went to Colossians, excuse me, Colossians in his missionary journeys.
[time=2890] He stopped at Ephesus and stayed there for about three years from which he preached and taught and it says there that everybody in Asia Minor heard the gospel.
[time=2897] Remember all those miracles that he was doing and people were bringing handkerchiefs and it was just, they were burning books and the sex were going by the side and it was great.
[time=2906] Our best understanding is that a paphras probably lived in this little city of Colossae, some
[time=2912] distance from Ephesus and heard about this stuff, came there, checked it out, heard the good news, accepted Christ by faith, allowed it to produce fruit.
[time=2921] He goes back to Colossae and starts telling everybody about Jesus and as a result you've got a church at Colossae.
[time=2927] As a result you've got a book called Colossians.
[time=2930] If a paphras could only know, how God chose to use his meager efforts, if a paphras only
[time=2937] could know that by his visit there to Ephesus and coming back and he probably wasn't some
[time=2943] Mr. Supergift person, he just did the thing, he just shared the faith and boom, there's
[time=2949] a church, one that has been studied and read about and learned from and benefited throughout
[time=2955] the centuries.
[time=2957] Come to chapter 4 just for a quick second, I'll tell you everything else we know about a paphras.
[time=2961] In verse 12 it says that he, a paphras who is one of your number, that's kind of why
[time=2967] I think he came out of Colossae, doesn't mean he had to, I mean maybe he lived in Ephesus and then moved to Colossae and now it's appropriate to call him one of your number.
[time=2977] You don't know, I don't know, but he's one of their number now, he lives there, cares for them, then it says he is a bond slave of Jesus Christ, who sends you his greeting
[time=2988] always, I like this part, laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand
[time=2994] perfect and fully assured in all the will of God, man that's great, you want to know how
[time=3000] to pray for somebody, you got somebody who's a little weak, who you're concerned about, who isn't doing as well as they ought to, pray this little prayer here.
[time=3010] Do it, labor at it, do it earnestly, but what are you going to do?
[time=3014] Pray that they will stand perfect, that means complete a mature, stand perfect and fully
[time=3020] assured, that means that their heart has a sense of assurance in all the will of God.
[time=3028] And then as you know that person just fill in the details, say, oh God, let that person stand perfect, let them mature, let them grow, strengthen them and give them a sense of assurance of your will for their life, tell it to them through the Word, tell it to them through friends, tell it to them through the subjective ministry of the Holy Spirit in their life.
[time=3048] Be like a paphras.
[time=3051] Back to chapter 1, so here is this obscure, unknown guy, but man what a legacy.
[time=3062] How exciting, the greatest news in the world, God gives it to people like a paphras, people
[time=3068] like you, people like me.
[time=3071] Let me just try to make a two points of application as we close.
[time=3080] Number one, and this came to me fresh and new this week as I was praying with a dear friend
[time=3086] over an unsaved friend, he has an unsaved friend and she's caught in a cult and doesn't
[time=3092] see the thing, doesn't see the truth.
[time=3094] He's worked and worked and worked and worked and worked and worked, but man you know how it says God has blinded the mind of the unbelieving and so we're there, we're praying.
[time=3106] And we're praying that God will open the eyes, we're praying that God will bring repentance, we're praying that God will bring conviction, we're praying that circumstances will add up in a way that they'll sense a need, she'll sense a need.
[time=3116] And then the prayer kind of drifted from that to a sense of why her and not me.
[time=3125] I mean why shouldn't I be the one who's caught in a cult and can't see the light of the gospel?
[time=3135] And then at Donza you realize that most of the people alive today in the United States of America don't understand what we're talking about, they've never apprehended Christ as
[time=3147] a personal Lord and Savior, many are called few are chosen, the way is very narrow, it's
[time=3153] always been the legacy of Christianity, the vast majority of people, then we are starting
[time=3160] to think about you know we'll go worldwide, do you realize that the billions of people that are here, the vast majority of them don't understand what we're talking about, they're not saying they don't understand the good news, then you just take one step past that
[time=3174] and go to a number that's mind boggling since the beginning of time, just look at the sea
[time=3182] of humanity that's been there and just recognize that you and I are among a very select few
[time=3192] of a gross minority who have ever been able to understand, comprehend, accept and believe
[time=3199] the gospel.
[time=3200] Man don't think this is common stuff what you hold in your heart, treasure it and let
[time=3208] it cause you to be thankful that you're saved.
[time=3213] The second thing I'd like to do is go back through these seven points and title only and ask you this, where are you weakest?
[time=3220] Where are you weakest in the gospel, where are you weakest and would you be willing to strengthen it this week for the glory of God?
[time=3227] Number one, the faith, some of you are here today and you don't know, you've never done this, you've never stood up on Christ and we can't make it any clearer for you.
[time=3238] We can just be praying that God's working in your heart, stand up on Christ okay, make that decision today, right now this week, put your whole destiny squarely on the shoulders
[time=3249] of Jesus Christ, His sacrifice, His death, His resurrection, and get saved.
[time=3255] The next one was love, the gospel produces love, how's it going in your life?
[time=3260] How's it going with your wife, your kids, your friends?
[time=3265] Are you fervently loving as the gospel would have you love?
[time=3269] Or would there be a little correction you'd like to make?
[time=3273] Maybe the area for you is hope.
[time=3275] Your gospel produces hope and maybe you're just fresh out of hope.
[time=3282] Maybe the circumstances of life are just beating the daylights out of you and all the music this morning is coming right down your alley and you're saying hope, I forget what it feels like to feel hope.
[time=3297] God, talk to your friends, pursue the scriptures, remind yourself, seek that God would build
[time=3306] you up and give you hope.
[time=3310] It's available to you.
[time=3311] Let's combine two of them, four and five.
[time=3313] The gospel penetrates the world and God uses men to proclaim it.
[time=3317] Man, we've got some opportunities, don't we?
[time=3320] They're coming.
[time=3322] We're excited about them to tell people about Christ to be trained in it and to be telling people about it.
[time=3328] Maybe you're still feeling on the outside of that whole process.
[time=3331] Maybe you're starting to feel like, I don't know about this soul winning thing.
[time=3335] Maybe you're frightened.
[time=3336] Maybe you're scared.
[time=3337] Maybe you're irritated.
[time=3338] I don't know what it is, but it just can't get any clear that what God wants to do is use you just like He did at Pafras to bring people to Christ.
[time=3343] And maybe you've had a barren desert of that in your life for the last seven or eight years.
[time=3348] Nothing is to be gained by just feeling badly about that.
[time=3352] He forgives you.
[time=3354] Just jump in, just jump in, be trained, be available.
[time=3361] Let's tell some people about Christ.
[time=3364] Fruit, you've got some undetected areas, hiding them away, disobedience.
[time=3370] You can't have this part.
[time=3374] Has something crept back into your life that you thought was gone?
[time=3377] Man, let's deal with that.
[time=3378] Let's deal with that this week, no matter how severe it is.
[time=3381] Let's deal with that sin problem.
[time=3383] So that fruit can start coming again.
[time=3387] Don't be afraid to deal with your sin.
[time=3389] Don't be afraid to talk to a friend.
[time=3391] Don't be afraid to be honest and face the truth about it and get it right.
[time=3396] If you don't, it'll only get worse.
[time=3400] Grace.
[time=3401] Oh man, the grace of God.
[time=3402] What do you do?
[time=3403] You can't do anything about grace because grace is grace.
[time=3405] Right?
[time=3406] That's the definition of grace.
[time=3407] You can't do anything about it.
[time=3408] Just thank Him for it.
[time=3410] Well, it's exciting in it.
[time=3411] The gospel.
[time=3412] You and I know it.
[time=3413] I'm thankful for what God's doing in our church.
[time=3417] I'm thankful for the good news, you guys.
[time=3420] I believe God's in this thing.
[time=3421] It's happening differently than I would have chosen than I would have anticipated.
[time=3426] I see still my own weaknesses in the whole process.
[time=3430] But you know what?
[time=3431] I believe that God is in this and He's starting to reveal it to His slow mature.
[time=3437] It's exciting to be a part of it.
[time=3444] Well, if that makes sense to you and if you're ready to put your faith in Christ and stand
[time=3450] on Him alone for your salvation, I invite you to pray this prayer with me.
[time=3454] I'll say it out loud and I invite you to say it in your heart to God and if you mean it, God will hear you and God will answer your prayer.
[time=3461] Let's pray together.
[time=3462] Father, I know that I'm a sinner.
[time=3464] I know that I have violated your law, that I deserve death and hell and damnation.
[time=3469] But I believe in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[time=3472] I put my faith in Him today.
[time=3474] I stand up on Christ as the foundation for my life and for my eternity.
[time=3479] Thank you for saving me in Christ.
[time=3481] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3483] Well, if you just prayed that prayer, we would love to hear from you.
