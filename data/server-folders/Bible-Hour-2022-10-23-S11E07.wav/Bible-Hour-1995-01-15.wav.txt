[time=0] What we see here in these verses 9 to 14 is a prayer for spiritual progress.
[time=8] That's what this is all about, Paul's prayer for their spiritual progress.
[time=13] Now in this prayer we see a description of spiritual progress.
[time=20] And listen carefully, here's Paul's description of spiritual progress.
[time=24] Paul says that spiritual progress is a godly mind that produces a godly life sustained
[time=31] by power and resulting in prayer.
[time=33] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=41] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=42] Today, Associate Pastor Tim Teder will be bringing us a message from the book of Colossians entitled "A Prayer for Spiritual Progress." But first, let's begin with a sanctuary choir singing in his presence.
[time=81] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=321] Hello, I'm Tim Teder, and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour.
[time=335] Typically, I know it's Pastor Russ who's seated here speaking with you, but this week he's in other parts of the country preaching, so it's my privilege to be able to speak on his behalf.
[time=344] And I want to take the time to let you know about a special program that's going to be happening here at Blackhawk coming up on January 29th, that Super Bowl Sunday.
[time=352] In the morning services, we're going to be having what we're calling an outreach service.
[time=357] Now, this is the first outreach service of a regular monthly outreach service we'll be having.
[time=361] During the past few years, God has been working through the leadership of our church to move us towards more involvement in personal evangelism and church-wide evangelism.
[time=371] And that's what this outreach service is all about, communicating the truth of God to people that need to hear it.
[time=377] Now, the format of the service is going to be quite a bit different than our normal services.
[time=381] The theme that morning will be when life gets out of control.
[time=385] We can probably all relate to times in our lives when things have gotten a little bit out of control.
[time=390] Perhaps it's problems at work or in our home or relationships or sickness, disease, whatever.
[time=397] There are times when we realize that there's a lot that we really don't have control of.
[time=401] And during those periods in life, people are, well, they tend to be a little bit more open to the message of God and how he can provide solutions to the difficulties of their life.
[time=410] And ultimately, the largest difficulty being a part separated from him.
[time=415] So we're going to talk that morning about when life gets out of control.
[time=418] And through the special music of celebration and soloist and a band that will be playing, and for the first ever drama performed by our newly formed drama team, and then from a special message from Pastor Russ, we want to communicate how God and his power
[time=434] provides solution to life that gets out of control.
[time=438] Now, who should come to a service like this?
[time=440] Well, I want to give a special invitation to those of you who perhaps watch the Bible hour every week, and you live close to Fort Wayne, you'd be able to visit our church, but you've never come and you don't have a church of your own.
[time=452] Well, this is the morning to come because this is going to be a church, probably like no church you've been to, no service you've been a part of before.
[time=459] As I mentioned through the music and drama, we want to kind of break down the walls that might come in the way of someone who isn't comfortable in church and provide a comfortable, safe environment to teach the truth of God.
[time=472] So we want to encourage you to come.
[time=474] If you've never come before, come that morning.
[time=477] Be part of our services either at 9, 10, or 1045.
[time=480] Or maybe you do go to church and maybe even a 10 Blackhawk on occasion.
[time=485] Well, this is a service that would be the kind of program for you to invite someone to, perhaps it's someone you work with or someone you live near or a friend or family member.
[time=494] Why don't you think about bringing them on January 29th in the morning, come to the service, and I think you and they both will enjoy what you see and what you hear.
[time=502] Be praying for us as we prepare for that special event.
[time=524] Just like a mother caring for a child, a friend who sticks through thick and thin,
[time=537] no matter what you've done or where you've been, just like one great big family.
[time=553] A stronger brother he will be, so quick and ready to defend.
[time=567] The younger we go to the end and he's ever interceding to the father for his children.
[time=589] Yes, for you he is interceding to the father for his own, through him you can reach the father.
[time=610] So bring him all your heavy burdens, yes he's ever reducing.
[time=622] So come only to his throne.
[time=638] Just like sheep we've got a strength, struggling so much with a dead way old,
[time=651] not ever hoping to renew.
[time=660] The love and fellowship that we once knew, but he began to intercede.
[time=672] Crying father please forgive I bleed, and as the nails pierced in his hands.
[time=689] God once again reached out to man and he's ever interceding to the father for his children.
[time=712] Yes, for you he's interceding to the father for his own, through him you can reach the father.
[time=734] So bring him all your heavy burdens, yes for you he's interceding.
[time=749] So come only to his throne. Yes, he's ever interceding.
[time=766] So come only to his throne.
[time=782] We'll return to more of the Bible hour in a moment, but here's a question for you.
[time=790] Do you have problems that seem to be too great to bear? Perhaps you wonder if there's any way out of the mess you're in. Well right now the Bible hour is offering free to all who write this booklet written by Jay Adams called Christ and Your Problems. Jay offers real hope.
[time=805] You'll gain courage to take responsible action knowing that there's real solutions found in God's Word. Stay tuned I'll give you our address at the end of the program.
[time=813] Last Sunday morning Pastor Russ began a series in the book of Colossians,
[time=822] which you're going to continue today in the book of Colossians chapter one. If you want to turn there we're going to be looking at verses nine through fourteen. Do you know what it means to be in crisis mode? Kind of be in the mode where you're just dealing with one problem after another.
[time=838] Sometimes we can get into a routine where we're living in the crisis mode. When we're putting the
[time=847] grease on one squeaky wheel and as soon as that one's done there's another one that's squeaking and we just go from wheel to wheel to wheel trying to solve the problems. Even in ministry maybe especially in ministry because of the service mindset that certainly is part of what
[time=863] we do we can get into crisis mode where we are simply dealing with the needs of people and that's
[time=870] becomes exclusive in our schedule and the person that cries the loudest that needs the most gets
[time=878] the attention and when that's done you're going on to the next difficulty, next crisis, the next problem.
[time=882] Even Jesus knew that he needed times to pull away to be alone or to focus time with just training and
[time=890] building the disciples and yet it's easy to come and that fall in that crisis mode. I would suspect that even in our prayer lives that many times we find ourselves moving into crisis mode and perhaps
[time=902] maybe that even becomes the pattern of our prayer. I mean we are simply find ourselves praying for
[time=911] the needs of people and the needs of a church or the needs of whatever and that becomes pretty much
[time=917] all we pray for. How do we get to that place? How do we get to the place where our prayer bulletins
[time=927] most of what we see you're just a tremendous amount of needs and when it comes to the thanksgiving and the praise it's so much smaller. Well we might suspect that Paul when he begins his prayer
[time=940] is praying in crisis mode because look how he starts in verse 9. For this reason also since the
[time=948] day we heard of it we have not ceased to pray for you. Since we heard about this since that day we
[time=956] have not stopped praying and boy to look at this you would think man Paul must be praying in crisis but he's dealing with one big problem here. There must be some difficulty that's come across the denominational newsletter Paul's picked it up and he's going whoa and since we heard that news we have been in constant prayer for you. But you know what the reality is? What is the Paul heard? Wasn't a problem of the Christians? Wasn't a difficulty in the church at clossing?
[time=984] What Paul heard was and you see it in verses 3 through 8 he'd heard about their faith in Christ he'd heard about their love for all saints he'd heard about their faithfulness to the gospel.
[time=994] He'd heard the good news and we heard the good news that wasn't a cause for him to kind of
[time=1002] remove them from his prayer list. I think sometimes maybe we do that someone gets on our prayer list because they have a need and then we find out oh things are going well well now I can fill that space in with somebody else. That's not what Paul says. He says I heard the good news and so I underlined you on my prayer list and I continue to pray for you because these good things are happening. You know the concern of Paul? The concern of Paul was that they would continue in the progress of their Christian life. We see that as a constant theme of Paul's prayer for believers
[time=1030] not just praying for Christ it's not just praying for problems but praying that they will progress
[time=1036] in their Christian life. To the Ephesians he prays I do not cease giving thanks for you while making mention of you in my prayers that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. To the Philippians he said I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment. To the Thessalonians we pray for
[time=1057] you always that our God may count you worthy of your calling and fulfill every desire for goodness
[time=1063] and the work of faith with power and it goes on and on. As he prays for believers you see as the theme
[time=1069] of his prayers and the theme of this prayer in Colossians 9 through 14 a prayer for spiritual
[time=1076] progress. That's what he's praying for. A prayer for spiritual progress and as we look at this prayer
[time=1083] we begin to see a description. Paul's description of spiritual progress in the life of believer and
[time=1089] here's it is and listen carefully because I'm going to test you on this later on. Paul's description of spiritual progress is this a godly mind produces a godly life sustained with power and resulting
[time=1104] in praise. One more time a godly life I mean godly mind results in a godly life sustained with power
[time=1113] and resulting in praise. Now you fill in the blanks for me you say it. Paul's description
[time=1120] of spiritual progress is what a godly mind that results in godly sustained by and resulting in.
[time=1130] So if I desire to have a life that is progressing spiritually or if you desire to have a life that
[time=1142] is progressing spiritually how does that come about? Well let me suggest
[time=1148] according to Paul's description that if you want to see spiritual progress in your life you must have four things. You must have first of all the right kind of knowledge you must have the right kind of behavior you must have the right kind of strength
[time=1165] and you must have the right kind of attitude. So let's look at them because Paul describes them in his prayer. He says spiritual progress requires the right kind of knowledge verse nine. He says for this reason also since the day we heard of it we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask what to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will. Paul says if you're going
[time=1188] to progress in your spiritual life here's the first thing I pray for you that you will be filled with the knowledge of his will. Do you know that it is possible for you to know the will of god?
[time=1199] It is possible for you to know what god requires of you and what he desires for you and what he wants for you and the way that he wants you to go. I know that's a big question among people that I talk to among believers. How can I know the will of god? Well god says that he he lets us know what
[time=1214] he desires for us he lets us know his will. Now we need to be careful the promise of god is never
[time=1220] that he will give us exhaustive knowledge concerning his will. In other words you were never promised that you will know everything there is to know about the course of your life. God never promises that when you wake up in the morning that god is going to reveal to you what you should wear that day. God has never promised that he should reveal what your schedule should be or where you should
[time=1241] shop for any number of decisions that we have to face in the course of life. God never promises
[time=1247] exhaustive knowledge concerning his will. But what god does promise is sufficient knowledge. You can
[time=1255] know everything that you need to know in regards to what he wants what he desires for you. And so
[time=1262] Paul prays I pray you know he says I pray that you will be filled with the knowledge of god's will
[time=1268] knowing who god is and what he wants. And where would the people where would the Christians gain
[time=1275] this knowledge? He says well in all spiritual wisdom and understanding the NIV translates it translates that through all spiritual wisdom and understanding. Where do we find the knowledge of
[time=1287] god's will? Spiritual wisdom and understanding. Now you're probably aware that in scripture there
[time=1294] is the contrast made between different kinds of wisdom between what the Bible calls worldly wisdom and what it calls spiritual or godly wisdom and understanding. Paul says that the knowledge of
[time=1305] god's will doesn't come just through our kind of natural or worldly wisdom and understanding trying to figure it all out. There's a problem with worldly wisdom and understanding. One of the
[time=1316] problems is that our understanding our wisdom is limited. It's finite. Isaiah chapter 40 as it
[time=1323] describes god it says you will not grow tired weary and it says his understanding no one can fathom.
[time=1328] None of us can really comprehend the fullness of god's mind the fullness of god's thinking.
[time=1334] We can never fully understand god's will because our minds are finite but we have a more significant problem even. And that is the problem of sin. Worldly wisdom and understanding is contaminated
[time=1346] by sinfulness. Romans chapter 8 says the sinful mind is hostile to god. It stands against god.
[time=1356] Is it an enemy of god? It does not submit to god's law nor can it do so. It says those controlled by
[time=1364] the sinful nature cannot please god. So we have a problem. And it says that Bible also teaches us
[time=1371] that worldly wisdom is characterized by pridefulness. 1 Corinthians 8 says knowledge puffs up love
[time=1380] builds up. So even if we're talking about religious knowledge or knowledge about god even that can
[time=1387] be worldly in the way we go about it. Someone can know a lot about god, about the church, about the Christian life, about a lot about the Bible. But it can be a worldly kind of wisdom if it results
[time=1398] in pride. So here's a test. Someone claims to have godly knowledge in their life.
[time=1406] Well is it godly? Ask this question. Does it result in an outpouring of humility and service
[time=1412] or does it result in pride? If it results in pride then it's probably even though it may have the connotation. The name of god attached to it is probably worldly wisdom. The contrast spiritual
[time=1422] wisdom the Bible tells us is what is the means by which we gain access to the knowledge of his will.
[time=1428] We discover what god desires of us through spiritual wisdom and understanding. Well how do I get that?
[time=1435] Well it comes from god. It comes from god. Jesus before he's left promises disciples that
[time=1441] he would be sending the spirit of god to them to remind them all of all the things that were said to them. Remind them of god's truth. So spiritual wisdom and understanding
[time=1452] comes through the spirit of god in our life. That's how we begin to understand. In fact the Bible says that the natural man, the man without the spirit of god, really can't understand these spiritual things. So it comes from god. The Bible also says that if we want to gain this kind of wisdom and understanding we should ask him for it James chapter 1. James right if any of you lack wisdom he should what ask god who gives to all men and women. If we desire his wisdom we
[time=1478] ask him and god gives it. But probably at the bottom of it all it's not just asking for wisdom and kind of sitting around waiting for it to happen. We gain this kind of spiritual wisdom by spending time learning the truth of god. His spiritual wisdom and understanding flows out of the truth
[time=1494] of god. And so we need to give ourselves to learning what god's truth is all about. In Colossians
[time=1500] chapter 3 it says let the word of Christ richly dwell in you. Let the word of Christ richly dwell in you. And then it says when this happens then with all wisdom and teaching you can admonish one another. So we've got to start with learning god's truth. That's why Paul prays first of all he
[time=1518] prays that god would fill them with the knowledge of his will and he doesn't just stop there. I mean
[time=1524] if that's all there was to gaining spiritual wisdom understanding then Paul could just stop say well I prayed for it god answers prayer so that's it. But Paul prayed that they would be filled with god's knowledge and then he goes on to the rest of the letter to explain the truth of
[time=1540] god to them. We want godly wisdom and understanding we need to spend time learning god's truth. Well
[time=1546] how much of this knowledge do we need? How much is good to have? Maybe a little goes a long way.
[time=1551] Well Paul says I pray that you will be filled with it. That you will be filled with it. This
[time=1557] word filled means to be filled up so completely that nothing else can be added. The Greek word was
[time=1565] a term that was used to describe ships when all the passengers had been loaded on to it. No room
[time=1571] for anyone else. It's the idea that we would have if we were to go visit a restaurant that we enjoyed
[time=1577] and go on a Friday evening when it's a little busy and we show up to the restaurant and there's a long line because the restaurant what is filled with capacity there's no available space all the
[time=1586] chairs all the booths all the tables are taken so we have to wait it's filled there's not room for anything else. So we wait 20 30 minutes and finally there's a available seat and we go and we sit down
[time=1597] and we enjoy the meal and we really enjoy the meal. We enjoy a large meal and when we get done
[time=1603] once we've eaten everything we push ourselves away from the table and we say oh man I am what
[time=1609] I'm full. I mean there's not room for anything else. I am completely full and then the server
[time=1616] brings the dessert menu and you know things get shoved around we realize there's a little bit more
[time=1622] room and we eat dessert and then now we are I mean absolutely no room for anything else that's the idea here to be filled up so completely there's not room for anything else. The same word is used in other places in scripture John chapter 12 where we have the picture of Jesus at Lazarus house and you know the story Jesus was there and and and Mary came with a bottle of expensive perfume
[time=1643] and opened the perfume and anointed Jesus feet with the perfume and the scripture says in describing
[time=1650] that event it says that the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. I don't know if Martha had been in the back room you know maybe fixing a little roast chicken or whatever but if she had been and they were enjoying the smell of the roast chicken something came and took
[time=1665] over the fragrance of the perfume it said that filled up the house. Luke chapter 4 uses the same
[time=1672] word when it describes Jesus coming to Nazareth and going into the synagogue and he takes the scroll of Isaiah and reads the prophecy concerning the Messiah and then he closes the scroll and goes
[time=1682] to sit down and he says these words he says today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing
[time=1689] same word. I mean there's nothing else that can be added to it. Jesus was saying he was fulfilling
[time=1696] the prophecy of the Messiah there's nothing else to nothing more to be done. He had fulfilled that prophecy. The season chapter 5 don't get drunk on wine instead be filled with the spirit to be so
[time=1707] filled out that nothing else can be put into. In other words what Paul is saying here what he's praying for the Christians is that the knowledge of God would totally dominate their mind. The
[time=1718] knowledge of God's will would totally control totally dominate their minds. Room for nothing else.
[time=1723] Continually constantly focusing on the truth of God is how this comes about.
[time=1734] I'd suggest that if you struggle with thinking in your life that's inconsistent with God's will I think our tendency is sometimes to blame culture. I mean we live in the 20th century we live in
[time=1747] the 1990s look at all of the crud going on around us. You can't turn on the TV you can't walk down the street you can't walk through a magazine rack. We are exposed to things that are opposed to
[time=1758] God's will constantly in our life and so maybe it becomes our tendency to want to blame our culture
[time=1764] and although the world in its system is certainly one of the things that we have to wrestle against I don't think I don't think we can place all the blame there. My guess is that
[time=1774] the problem isn't so much with the culture as it is with my preoccupation with the culture.
[time=1779] It's that I let the little gates of my mind open to let in the stuff that culture is enticing me
[time=1786] with and offering to me and if my mind isn't preoccupied continually and constantly with the truth of God then there's going to be room for other things to get in and by that I don't mean that we're walking through life you know with our heads in the Bible we're memorizing scripture and we can't we you know we're oblivious to everything around us I don't mean that but I do mean that as we focus on all the events of life and we're exposed to all the things of life there is a grid that it passes through and that is the truth of God that's come from learning this come from learning his word and so when I see something when I hear something what is my thought my thought is is
[time=1822] this consistent with what God says is true and if it's not closed door no room for it to be filled
[time=1829] with the knowledge of God's will I would also suggest that I mean if there is any interest in your
[time=1836] life that requires you to set apart God's truth I mean to be involved in that particular thought
[time=1843] or practice hobby interest to be involved in that means that you kind of to set aside what you know
[time=1851] God desires because they're not consistent then you need to get rid of it so I move through life
[time=1860] everything I do and think all the way that I act needs to be in consistency with the truth of God so Paul says spiritual progress requires first of all the right kind of knowledge
[time=1872] because a godly mind is where it starts and that produces a godly life so the second thing he
[time=1879] says spiritual progress requires the right kind of behavior verse 10 so that you may walk in a
[time=1886] manner worthy of the Lord to please him in all respects bearing fruit in every good work and
[time=1892] increasing in the knowledge of God look at those first two words in that verse so that there is a relation between knowledge and behavior he's just saying I want you to know more so that you are
[time=1905] able to be different the purpose for knowledge is never intended to stop in our minds but is to
[time=1916] result in a changed life changed character and that's Paul's point the result of godly knowledge
[time=1923] will be a changed life and he describes the right kind of behavior that will be evidence in a life
[time=1932] that is spiritually progressing he describes it in these phrases he says living worthy of the Lord
[time=1938] pleasing him in every way goes on in that verse to say the bearing fruit in every good work and
[time=1944] growing in the knowledge of God those are the four descriptions he gives of a life behavior that
[time=1950] is progressing spiritually let's just look at those each a little bit right kind of behavior is living
[time=1957] worthy of the Lord what does that mean we sang of course not too long ago worthy you are worthy
[time=1963] what does that mean worthy worthy means to be literally means to be equal to the standard
[time=1970] to be equal to the standard we're to visit a Mercedes plant the cars coming down the assembly
[time=1977] line all the pieces are being put together along the assembly there would be points of inspection
[time=1983] and at the end of the assembly there would be a final inspection what what's what's the purpose of the inspection well to determine whether that car is being made manufactured in a way that is
[time=1994] equal to the standard that the Mercedes people want a car to to look and to run and to you know be like
[time=2003] is it worthy to be called a Mercedes when the president of our country appoints a man or a woman
[time=2009] to the supreme court that person will appear before committee and the the congressmen and women on that committee will ask questions for what purpose to determine
[time=2024] whether this individual is worthy of the position are equal to the standard some of you have sons or daughters it may come come a time when that son or daughter comes in
[time=2039] your life it brings someone else into your life a man or a woman that is engaged to them
[time=2045] and as a parent i would imagine that the natural tendency will be to kind of look over
[time=2051] that young man or young woman and give them the ones over and the twice over and be thinking your mind is this person worthy of my son or daughter are they equal to the standard
[time=2062] will probably be a little harsh in our judgment but that's the whole question of worthiness
[time=2068] are they equal to the standard what does Paul say here what is our standard the lord live
[time=2074] worthy equal to the standard of the lord he does not say live equal to the standard of our own expectations he doesn't say live equal to the standard of your pastor's expectations he doesn't say live equal to the standard of other people's expectations he says live worthy of the lord our
[time=2090] standard is christ his example his life his character his holiness john makes it clear in the book of first john chapter two verse six he says whoever claims
[time=2102] to live in him talking about jesus whoever claims to live in him must walk as jesus did
[time=2108] now we may lower the standard at time we may say well it's enough to meet this expectation to meet
[time=2114] this standard but god never lowers the standard our standard to live a life worthy of the lord
[time=2120] he goes on with another another description he says to please him in all respects
[time=2127] pleasing him in every way the greek word that's translated please here suggests an attitude of a mind that anticipates every wish of a person and longs to fulfill that
[time=2139] it's the it's a picture of a of a man who loves a woman so much that he spends time getting to know
[time=2145] her and has he he begins to understand her more and more he he understands her needs and her desires
[time=2151] and her wants and her wishes and even before she expresses them he begins to fulfill those
[time=2157] he begins to do those things for her that's what this pleasing is talking about and it says that
[time=2163] we need to be pleasing christ in that way as we grow to know him we anticipate what he wants in our life and our desire is not to wait till we're just in the moment
[time=2174] caught in the circumstance and then decide yeah what am i supposed to do but to be anticipating the ways that we can please him bring pleasure to him in our lives that's the right kind of behavior
[time=2186] he describes it in other ways as it's the kind of behavior i'm talking about is bearing fruit in every good work he says you know that's what we're created to do good works
[time=2196] patients 210 for we are God's workmanship created white to do good works which God has
[time=2204] prepared in advance for us to do that's the that's a purpose of our being saved that's a purpose of
[time=2210] our being here on earth to do the good things that God has had prepared for us to do you uniquely
[time=2217] have have things that God has prepared for you to do those good things and that's what he's recreated you given you new birth given you life through Jesus Christ and his desires that you do those things in fact Jesus indicated that that should be what is very natural to the believer
[time=2234] and Jesus described it in this way Jesus said it's if I were to describe my relationship with you he
[time=2241] told his disciples it would be it's like i'm i'm a vine and your branch is coming out of the vine
[time=2247] anyone who is truly abiding in me i'll tell you what's going to be happening in their life
[time=2254] they will bear fruit they will bear fruit and you know what else Jesus said he said Jesus is like
[time=2260] the garden who comes in and prunes the branches so they'll bear what more fruit that that's just natural of a branch attached to the vine as Christians in our relationship with Jesus Christ he is producing the fruit of good works through us and the last description he gives of this right kind
[time=2278] of behavior says that well it's person who's growing in the knowledge of God now he's already prayed that they will be filled with the knowledge of God's will now he says that in your behavior i want you to be growing in the knowledge of God the way this struck me when i read it is you know it's never right for me to get to the place where i say well i've learned enough i mean paul pray that i'll be filled with the knowledge of God but then he goes well i want you to go on from there and keep learning about God i can never get to the point in my life where i said well i've arrived i know everything i need to know i've read the book i've heard the sermons i've done the devotionals
[time=2309] i've ordered the james kennedy tape or whoever you know you happen to listen to and i know everything
[time=2318] we get in that attitude we're kind of like the you know the college freshman who turns in a ten page report on the complete history of the universe explains everything no we need to continue to learn about God and the necessity of this word and learning about him
[time=2337] we're reminded peter reminds us like newborn babies crave the pure spiritual milk of God's
[time=2344] word so why so that you may grow in other words i think peter saying i mean paul is saying here to the Colossians my desires that you continue to grow and the knowledge of God continue to grow in truth continue to expose yourself to God's truth and to grow in it don't ever be satisfied it was just kind of settling back and thinking you've arrived so spiritual progress requires the right kind of knowledge spiritual progress if i want to
[time=2369] progress in my spiritual life it requires the right kind of behavior and you say well how do i do that i mean what you told me as far as what God wants us the way he wants us to live i mean my goodness worthy of the lord please him in every way bearing fruit in every good work you've got to
[time=2387] be kidding there's no way i can do that that's why the third thing is required if we're going to progress in our spiritual life paul says spiritual progress requires the right kind of strength verse
[time=2399] 11 strengthened with all power according to his glorious might now here's the process i can't do this on i can't live this kind of life on my own that's why God promises that his
[time=2411] spirit is at work in me strengthening me here's here's what paul says being strengthened with what
[time=2417] with all power and where does the power come from all his glorious might from all his glorious might
[time=2424] divine power giving us power making us powerful so that we can live the life God calls us to live
[time=2432] it's the same truth that peter writes about when he is writes a letter in second peter
[time=2438] and he tells the people in second peter chapter one verses two and three says grace and peace be
[time=2445] multiplied to you and again something similar to what paul wrote to the closhems in the knowledge of god of our lord jesus verse three says sing that his divine power has granted to us
[time=2457] everything pertaining to life and godliness the power of god has given us everything we need to live a life of godliness that's what his power gives us he enables us there is no such thing
[time=2470] as a christian being being able to truthfully say i can't do it i can't live the life
[time=2478] god calls me to live because the bible says you can not because of your ability but because of
[time=2484] god's enablement you can do it because he gives you the strength the ability to do it well that may sound like theory to some people you can talk all you want about the power of god and a christian's life to him but uh
[time=2501] i'll just be honest with you it's not there i certainly don't experience this kind of power
[time=2510] well it may be that your problem is if we back up a little bit it may be that somehow your
[time=2522] behavior is wrong which indicates that probably your thinking is probably wrong it all goes back to the truth of god and we when we get off when we begin thinking wrong and acting wrong we
[time=2533] we're not experiencing the power of god great example of this is the life of david king of israel
[time=2541] walking out on his roof of the palace one day looked over and there's a bathtub on the roof
[time=2547] next to him and there was a woman in the bathtub strange place for a bathtub to be in our day and age but maybe is a little more common back then now at up to that point there was nothing wrong
[time=2560] with what had happened i mean david wasn't in sin because he looked over the roof and saw this woman in a tub the problem was david began to think wrong david not was not filled with the
[time=2571] knowledge of god i mean there was room for something else and he opened up the gate and he began to think began to fantasize and his thinking turned to wrong behavior he invited basheba into his bedroom
[time=2581] you know the story from there led to pregnancy or led to murder led to covering up of his sin
[time=2587] and it's interesting when all this happened listen how david describes himself he said when i kept
[time=2595] silence in other words when i just tried to cover up the sin said it was like my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long for day and night your hand was heavy upon me my strength was sapped
[time=2606] as in the heat of summer it writes that in song 32 his strength was gone why because his thinking
[time=2613] his wrong thinking led to wrong behavior and he didn't experience the strength of god in his life and david realized that for him to be renewed in the strength of god required that he back up and
[time=2624] began the process over and so he says to god he says he said then i acknowledge my sin to you i did not cover up my iniquity i said i will confess my transgression and confession simply means agreeing
[time=2635] with god about our sin so david backed up and said okay i'm going to get my mind right again i confess my sin so that my behavior is right so the strength of god can be restored in my life
[time=2646] what's the result of god's power in us in this verse why does god why does paul pray that the power
[time=2658] of god would be at work in them for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience he says end
[time=2665] of verse 11 for the attaining of steadfastness and patience we might say endurance and self-restraint
[time=2671] these things come from the power of god and it comes starts back up against from knowing god
[time=2677] this is the kind of power that produces this kind of steadfastness and patience this was the
[time=2684] kind of power that was worked at work in jobe in the old testament when he faced suffering and persecution because he remains steadfast and faithful why because he knew god the same kind of
[time=2698] power that's worked at joseph sold in the slavery in egypt and all the difficulties he faced in egypt finally being thrown into prison and he remade steadfast and patient why because he knew
[time=2710] god trusted god and god's power was at work in him it's the same kind of power
[time=2717] at work in janecius of rome who became a martyr for the christian faith and before he died he
[time=2724] penned this prayer he said there is but one king that i know it is he that i love and worship
[time=2730] if i were to be killed a thousand times for my loyalty to him i would still be his servant christ is on my lips christ is in my heart no amount of suffering will take him from me
[time=2742] that's power that's strength it comes from knowing god the same kind of power that's at work in a
[time=2750] christian man who because he refuses to be involved in even a hint of dishonesty at work is bypassed
[time=2756] over and over again for promotion and yet he remains steadfast patient
[time=2762] it's the same kind of power that's at work in a woman who has given her life to christ but is married to a man who refuses the gospel and year after year she prays that he will come to christ and year after year he refuses and yet she still continues to pursue him in love that's power comes from knowing god same kind of power that's at work in it a couple who's engaged
[time=2784] who are committed to sexual purity because it honors god even when it seems like they're the only ones i met with a couple this week preparing for marriage and they said one thing that we're thankful for and proud of is the fact that we've stood
[time=2799] by that commitment and it's been hard and it seems like everyone around us makes a different choice
[time=2805] and we're kind of the oddballs in all of this it takes strength takes power comes from knowing god
[time=2817] we want to progress spiritually in our christian life we've got to have a right kind of knowledge that produces the right kind of behavior that's supported that's strengthened by the right kind of strengthen our life and finally we need spiritual progress requires in our life the right kind of attitude two things i believe paul mentions in this passage in regards to attitude one is joy
[time=2837] and what is thanksgiving now the word joy is actually comes at the end of verse 11 and translators
[time=2843] kind of had a little bit of problem knowing exactly where this word fits because it's not real clear is is paul saying that he is praying that they will have joy in their steadfastness and patience
[time=2855] or is he saying that they'll have joy in their thanksgiving well your bible may put it one or the other and it's not real clear and i don't know that it makes all that much
[time=2865] different the point is that in the midst of everything one attitude that god is going to be true of the person who's progressing their christian life is an attitude of joy the reality of joy and again
[time=2876] this kind of joy comes coast back again to knowing god to knowing a god that we can trust in even
[time=2884] despite difficult circumstances even when it seems like everything seems like everything in our life is messed up we still know that there is a god who is in control who cares about us and that
[time=2894] results in joy sometimes an unbelievable circumstance is paul and silos in prison they'd been beaten
[time=2900] they were locked in these stocks and they're sitting there in prison it wasn't say they do
[time=2906] they start singing and they i don't think they were singing oh i'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
[time=2918] join in with me silos traveling through it wasn't the blues it says they were singing praise to god
[time=2925] now where does that joy come from comes from knowing god it's a right kind of attitude
[time=2933] and not only the attitude of joy but the attitude of thanksgiving he says in verse 12 giving thanks
[time=2940] to the father now there are all kinds of reasons that we should give thanks to god scripture tells us to give thanks to god we need to be thanking god says in the bible for his goodness for his love for his provisions for his food for friends in fact in phoenix chapter five verse 20 it says thank god for everything that kind of sums it up but i i would guess that probably the highest reason for our giving thanks to god is because of his salvation and that's what paul highlights in this
[time=2967] prayer it says that here's what you ought to give thanks give thanks that god has saved you and he describes the salvation of god in this these ways he says god has qualified you god has rescued you
[time=2977] god has moved you god has redeemed you and god has forgiven you giving thanks to god the father verse 12 who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the
[time=2989] saints of light he's qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints of light now what are
[time=2995] the qualifications what are the requirements to be to to inherit inherit what the saints of light
[time=3002] inherit you know what the qualification is you know what the requirement is absolute righteousness absolute perfection that's what a saint of light is if you want to inherit what a saint of light
[time=3013] inherits you've got to be righteous there's no way i come before god am i qualified
[time=3020] not qualified nobody can stand before god and get the stamp of approval stamp of qualification
[time=3027] we are not qualified first Corinthians chapter six describes it this way don't you know that the
[time=3033] wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god you are not qualified and it goes on to give some description neither the sexually immoral nor the idolaters nor the adulterers male prostitutes homosexual offenders thieves greedy the drunkards slanderers swindlers and we could go on and on
[time=3048] that's a sampling says none of these will inherit the kingdom of god not qualified and that's us
[time=3055] i mean maybe each of those actions aren't true of you but if we could expand the list and put down
[time=3061] all the things that scripture talks about as being sin is violating the righteousness of god there's gonna be a mess of them that are true of you that are true of me we are not qualified but that passage in first Corinthians six goes on to say but that's what you were that's what you were
[time=3075] but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord Jesus Christ god qualifies us that's what paul says he has qualified you to share in the inheritance
[time=3087] the inheritance of eternal life the inheritance of the kingdom of god the inheritance of a new heaven and earth that god promises us to us all that's given to us because god qualifies us makes us righteous through Jesus Christ it goes on to describe our salvation in terms of what god
[time=3104] does it says god rescued us he said verse 13 he delivered us from the domain of darkness
[time=3110] god rescued you god saved you from the dominion of darkness it what is true about your life before
[time=3118] god rescued you is not only that you were without god but that you were against a god you were part of the control of everything that was opposed to god and scripture one point says that
[time=3128] you were an enemy of god god came and took you out of the dominion of darkness rescued you from
[time=3134] that rescued us from that rescued me from that it goes on to say that he moved you didn't just
[time=3140] save you from something but he transferred you moved you somewhere else verse 13 again says transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son he puts us in a place he puts us in a spiritual
[time=3151] realm in which Christ is recognized and served as king that wasn't true of you before
[time=3159] now there may have been an acknowledgement even the demons may acknowledge the the right of Christ as lord and king but they don't worship and serve him as such but now you've been brought to a spiritual realm the kingdom of god where Christ is not only recognized as king but worshiped and served as king and through Christ it says in verse 14 god redeemed us
[time=3178] paid the price he didn't pay it to satan he didn't go to satan say i want to buy
[time=3186] i don't want to i want to buy john back here's here's what i owe you for john you know what you know the price who was paid to god paid the price to himself the price was the the price demanded by the penalty of breaking god's law and that's the price
[time=3202] that god demanded in a very real sense when we when god saves us he saves us from himself he saves us from his wrath from his judgment and through the death of jesus christ and the cross he satisfied
[time=3215] his justice and we were bought back we are redeemed and it says at the end of verse 14 that he forgives us of our sins as that are those reasons to have an attitude of thankfulness sure are a godly mind produces a godly life sustained by power resulting in praise i'd imagine all of us fit
[time=3235] probably one of three categories this morning for some of you perhaps you look at what we've read
[time=3242] and in your life actually falls somewhere before the events of verses 12 through 14
[time=3249] i mean when paul praised the prayer of thanksgiving and the reasons they should be thankful he's talking in past tense he's saying that the christians to the christians god has already done these things for you but for some of you perhaps your life falls somewhere even before that you've never come to the point when those where those things are true of you you have not been
[time=3269] qualified you have not been rescued and the opportunity god gives you even today is to have
[time=3276] all the see the provisions has already been made christ has already died and all it requires of us is to come to god and let him go of everything and say god i just i
[time=3285] give it to you i believe my life belongs to you do all that stuff rescue me qualify me
[time=3292] save me out of this dominion transfer me to your kingdom redeem me forgive me any promises to do
[time=3298] all that perhaps for some of us your life if you had to put it somewhere you'd have to put it somewhere
[time=3304] between verses eight and nine of first Corinthians one because those things in verses three through eight those good things that happen in christian life those things have been true of you you have been growing there's been evidence of of love of faith and hope you can look back in your life and you see that those things were true but something happened along the way that stopped the progress and now when you think about your christianity you tend to think in terms of the past
[time=3327] tend to think in terms of kind of the way things have already always been at least for a long time and you're not thinking in terms of progress and growth just want you to understand that what god desires for you is for you to be able to go on for you to progress and probably what you need to
[time=3343] come back to is come back to a mind that is so overtaken so dominated by the truth of god that
[time=3351] is going to result in these other things other something else has gotten in the way in your life and that needs to be getting rid of and perhaps for some of us too we would put our life somewhere
[time=3362] in the progress of verses nine through fourteen that we are growing we are progressing in these things can i just remind you and remind me that we need to be praying for one another as we progress
[time=3373] you know in this time of our church in this period of our church life when it can become
[time=3379] easy to just focus on the problems and difficulties and make those the manner of prayer let's not forget to hold hold one another as we grow in our Christian lives because we fail to do that what happens when we just give attention to problems well then all the good things that are happening can begin to slip we need to continue to support and encourage and to pray as we continue
[time=3400] to grow and progress in Christ and it results in what in praise i hope as you come together on
[time=3408] Sunday mornings or anytime you come together with other believers there is a natural honest expression desire in your heart to praise and to honor and to worship God because of all of this
[time=3418] that's what it leads us into and father we praise you for that this morning for all that you have
[time=3425] done and continue to do god continue to teach us your truth so that can change our life
[time=3432] and god support us sustain us by your power as you promise to do
[time=3441] pray in christ name amen
[time=3448] thank you for joining us today as we've looked at paul's prayer for the christians
[time=3455] as you considered your own walk with god or your progress in your christian life
[time=3461] maybe you have some questions it may be a question of how to even begin a relationship with god or to know him and his will for your life or maybe you find yourself stuck somewhere in the process
