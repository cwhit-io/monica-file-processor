[time=0] This morning, as we come to this text, I want you to play the role of the headhunter.
[time=7] I want you to take an eye, a scrutinizing eye, at who might be the right man for the
[time=13] job.
[time=15] First of course, we need to define the job.
[time=17] The job in view here is that of salvation, saving people from their sins.
[time=23] But not just finding forgiveness.
[time=25] The second aspect of the job is we need someone who can sanctify them.
[time=30] Someone who can grow them and work with them through the trials and the hardships, the ups and downs of life, so that as they are moving in and through the situation of life, they are growing and maturing and perfecting.
[time=42] But it doesn't stop there.
[time=43] We have to find the right man for the job, who can only forgive, but sanctify and then ultimately glorify these common lumps of human clay.
[time=54] Eternally secure them, make them so that they are able to be in the presence of God and
[time=60] found their secure for all eternity.
[time=63] That's the job description.
[time=64] The question that I ask you to engage in this morning is who is the right man?
[time=75] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=79] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=80] Getting the right man for the job is essential for any operation.
[time=84] The more important the job, the more the field of possible applicants narrows, and the harder
[time=90] people are willing to look for just the right man.
[time=94] Well this morning we look to find the right man for the most important job that has ever been done, saving people from their sins.
[time=103] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore's study of Colossians 1 reveals there's only one man for the job of salvation.
[time=112] Who is this one that we worship?
[time=114] His name is Jesus, Emmanuel, the living word, son of God and son of man.
[time=121] He is the friend of sinners and the righteous judge, the lion of Judah and the lamb of God.
[time=128] He is the Messiah, the living word, the way, the truth, the light of the world.
[time=135] He is our Savior, the author and finisher of our faith, the resurrection and the life, the shepherd of our souls.
[time=143] He is the holy one, the alpha and the omega, the king of kings and Lord of all.
[time=151] He is the image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation.
[time=156] For by Him all things were created, things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[time=162] whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities, all things were created by Him and for Him.
[time=169] He is before all things and in Him all things hold together and He is the head of the body,
[time=176] the church.
[time=177] He is the beginning and the first born from among the dead so that in everything He might
[time=183] have the supremacy.
[time=184] For God was pleased to have all His fullness dwell in Christ and through Him to reconcile
[time=190] to Himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through
[time=196] His blood shed on the cross.
[time=198] Therefore, God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name that is above every name.
[time=204] That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth.
[time=209] And every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[time=214] To the glory of God, the Father.
[time=239] Lord above all things were created with the trust in heart.
[time=251] Lord above all the desperate fear which His such faith evolved.
[time=263] Lord above all of the nations went to bring their miracles.
[time=270] Lord above all of His strength and my His Mother saved the bone.
[time=278] Lord above all things were created with the power of the Father.
[time=457] Praise be upon you Lord.
[time=462] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour
[time=486] and thank you for joining us today.
[time=488] I guess if you were experiencing tremendous chest pains,
[time=494] you'd have a little question in your mind who you'd call to put on the job.
[time=497] It'd be a doctor, more specifically the best cardiologist your money could buy.
[time=502] If you found that you had a toothache and were in tremendous need of a root canal, I don't think you'd call a plumber, you'd go to a good dentist.
[time=512] If someone were suing you and dragging you into a court of law and you knew you were innocent but there was a great deal at stake, you'd try to find the best attorney, the best defense attorney that your money could buy.
[time=522] It's important, isn't it, to find the right person to do the right job?
[time=526] When you think about your own spiritual life as you would examine that, as you would see how you relate to God, how you relate to people, are you loving, are you sacrificial or are you relating well in your life to people?
[time=539] And as God helping you do that, who do you turn to?
[time=543] I guess a lot of people turn a lot of places, a lot of different religions in the world that are offering the kind of help I think people are seeking.
[time=551] Today in our study, one we're going to lift up Jesus Christ as the only person to call to help you in these various issues, the spiritual issues of your life.
[time=560] I trust you'll stay with us and consider Christ and His power in your life.
[time=569] [MUSIC] When I think in the sunset [MUSIC] On the day that Jesus died [MUSIC] I felt the glow of His sunrise [MUSIC] When the two was open wide [MUSIC] I have known you [MUSIC] What I have seen [MUSIC] That you were more than just a man [MUSIC] You were Lord and King [MUSIC] But now I've known you [MUSIC] And I can see [MUSIC] That you were more than just a man [MUSIC] But if I knew you were Lord to me [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus, Lord to me [MUSIC] As to save your place [MUSIC] Rulara, the Lord to be dead [MUSIC] Jesus, the Lord to me [MUSIC] Jesus, Jesus [MUSIC] Lord to me [MUSIC] As to save your prince of peace [MUSIC] Rulara, my heart today [MUSIC] Jesus, Lord to me â™ª
[time=734] We'll return to more of the Bible Hour in a moment, but here's a question for you.
[time=738] Do you have problems that seem to be too great to bear?
[time=741] Perhaps you wonder if there's any way out of the mess you're in.
[time=744] Well, right now, the Bible Hour is offering free to all who write this booklet written by J. Adams called "Christ and Your Problems." J offers real hope.
[time=753] You'll gain courage to take responsible action, knowing that there's real solutions found in God's Word.
[time=758] Stay tuned. I'll give you our address at the end of the program.
[time=761] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father, what a tremendous joy it is to be in a personal relationship
[time=767] with Christ, where we can sing these songs from our heart and know that they are true, that they are real, that they make the difference in our life, your love and who you are.
[time=777] We're singing about reality here, not wishes, not hopes, not dreams.
[time=782] Father, we thank You now as we have an opportunity to open Your Word and pray, God, that Your Spirit would minister to us through it.
[time=788] Pray these things in Christ's name. Amen.
[time=792] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come with me back to the book of Colossians chapter 1.
[time=799] I want to say a special word of thanks to Tim for continuing our study.
[time=803] I had a chance to review his message and learn from it and was thankful for it.
[time=807] I trust you are as well, and for the privilege of moving through this book and trying to understand the truth that God has for us in this wonderful book of Colossians.
[time=818] One of the things I am most intrigued with in corporate America
[time=824] are these individuals called head hunters or executive search firms.
[time=831] What will happen is a high level executive position will open up.
[time=835] Someone's been fired or someone's gone somewhere else. It's essential position.
[time=839] It's very important that the company find the right replacement, and rather than take that responsibility on themselves, they will hire this job out to an executive search firm, people called head hunters.
[time=851] I've been paying attention to this at all in the last several years.
[time=854] You'll know that the chief executive officer of companies such as IBM or Westinghouse or Nabisco or Upjohn, huge multi-million dollar corporations have lost their central figure, their guiding light, the man for the job, so to speak, and so they have, through that time, given the responsibility to various firms, head hunters to find the replacement.
[time=879] They can earn these head hunters as much as a third of the first year salary
[time=885] of the position they're trying to fill.
[time=888] In some cases, that'll be over a million dollar fee to find one person for one job.
[time=894] But it's worth it. A good head hunter will first help that company define the position, get a clear focus of the job description, and with that in hand, then begin the search for the right man for the job.
[time=908] They will often have as many as two to three hundred thousand resumes in their files, which they will begin to analyze and refine and narrow down,
[time=919] sometimes to twenty or thirty people, who they will then interview by phone and through correspondence. The number usually shrinks then down to about six where the head hunter will interview for as much as an hour and a half, and sometimes that over a number of days until finally in a perfect situation, the head hunter will deliver to the corporation two or three candidates and hope the corporation has a hard time figuring out for themselves which would be the final choice.
[time=948] Well, I want to invite you this morning to play the role of a head hunter.
[time=954] I want to invite you to be a person willing to understand first the job description
[time=962] and then be willing to review, I'll just offer you one resume this morning,
[time=968] to see if this in fact wouldn't be the right person for the right job.
[time=972] You see the church at Colossae understood the job to be done.
[time=978] They wanted to be saved. They wanted somebody who could not only forgive them from their sins, but would be strong enough, powerful enough, faithful enough and patient enough to then help them grow in salvation,
[time=994] to learn to be more loving and less selfish, to give them power to work through the trials of life. But there was more to this job description.
[time=1003] There was needed someone who could take care of them for all eternity, bring them to ultimate glorification, make them fit to be in the presence of a holy God and allow that fitness to remain for all eternity
[time=1020] so that they would never, ever, ever lose their salvation.
[time=1025] There's the job description. They were beginning to wonder if Christ was really enough.
[time=1034] They were beginning to wonder if there shouldn't be some things added
[time=1040] to that original pure, simple faith that they had put in Christ.
[time=1044] In fact, they were being taught by some false teachers.
[time=1048] Come to chapter 2, if you will, for just a second, and you can see what they were contemplating as maybe a need to add to Christ.
[time=1058] In verse 8 is this need for philosophy. See to it that no one takes you captive
[time=1064] through philosophy and empty deception, according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world, rather than according to Christ.
[time=1073] They were being tempted and led astray potentially. We know this because Paul is reacting against it.
[time=1078] That Christ was not sufficient, that philosophy, some conceptual understanding, the traditions of men. And I'm thankful that Paul doesn't even explain those to us. He just reacts against them in total.
[time=1092] There was another competing force to say that Christ was not sufficient.
[time=1096] You can see it in verse 16. It's legalism. Let therefore no one act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day. You see, the implication was Christ really isn't enough.
[time=1110] You must add to Him this legalistic practice of what you will eat or will not eat,
[time=1116] what you will drink, what you will not drink, your faithfulness to the festival, your observance of the new moon, your keeping of the Sabbath day.
[time=1124] If you're really going to be saved, and if you're really going to get sanctified, and if you're really going to get glorified and safe for all eternity, Christ is not enough.
[time=1136] Verse 18. There's another competing voice. It cries out this way, "Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement
[time=1146] and the worship of angels, taking his stand on visions he has seen and flated without cause by his fleshly mind." It's as if this voice says Christ isn't enough.
[time=1158] There are angels, spirit beings, who if you are to be saved and secure in your salvation, you must worship them.
[time=1166] You want to know which ones? Listen to my visions, the ones that I have learned, I have received visions, and I can tell you, I can discern the unseen spirit world for you.
[time=1178] Christ is not enough. Christ is not the man for the job.
[time=1182] Verse 21. Another competing voice.
[time=1186] Do not handle, and do not taste, do not touch.
[time=1190] It's a form of asceticism, self-denial, self-deprecation to do bodily harm by not receiving the normal, natural things of life. It's not enough to have Christ.
[time=1202] You must beat yourself up. You must do yourself bodily harm. You must have a level of self-discipline that you'll deprive yourself, even the most necessary things.
[time=1214] Then will your salvation be whole? Christ is not the man for the job is what they were being told.
[time=1222] Now, back to chapter 1.
[time=1226] Verses 15 to 19 reads like a resume. I mean it just reads like a resume. And Paul is lifting up the person of Christ to say he is enough. He is the right man for the job. You need nothing else. You need go nowhere else.
[time=1242] He is everything as our songs and our beginning of our service have already attested. And we'll break the resume into four parts. The first part of this resume answers the question, who is this guy? Not so much his education, his accomplishments, not so much where he might have gone to school, but who is he by way of character and values? The essence of this individual.
[time=1266] And when you're reviewing human being interviews for a normal job, you kind of look at his family, you look at hobbies, you look at, you look for clues to where he places his values that might give you some indication of who he is as a person.
[time=1278] Then the resume will reveal to us what he has done, accomplishments.
[time=1282] Then thirdly, what he is currently doing, what he has done, thirdly, what he is currently doing, and then uniquely in this resume, and by the way, you don't get this in normal resumes, we're going to find out what he's going to do, what he's going to do, and it's all here. And he's lifted up, Christ is lifted up above any other competing voice to say that he is enough.
[time=1306] Alright, let's get started. Here's the resume.
[time=1310] First question, who is this guy? Verse 15.
[time=1314] And he is the image of the invisible God, the first born of all creation.
[time=1322] The question comes in the mind of the interview. Tell me something of this man's character, his value, his essence. Leave out for now the talents, the education, the accomplishments, strip him of all that. Who is he? Answer.
[time=1334] God. Let's hire him.
[time=1338] What you're dealing with in the person of Jesus Christ is nothing other than God. But the question comes, why is he described like this, image of the invisible God? I mean, Christ has many names.
[time=1350] The Alpha and the Omega, the Mighty Counselor, the Prince of Peace, why this description?
[time=1358] Well, the word image means exact copy or representation.
[time=1362] So, Christ verse 15 is the exact representation of something we cannot see, namely God.
[time=1370] The invisible God. First Timothy verse 15 tells us that God who alone possesses immortality dwells in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see. We have a God who we cannot see. We cannot even approach him because he dwells in unapproachable light. And the wonder of creation is we know that a God exists. Romans 1 tells us.
[time=1398] We can also understand from creation that he is a powerful God and we know that he is a wise God.
[time=1406] But think of all we wouldn't know if we were just left with those basic things which the general creation or general revelation presents.
[time=1414] In Christ, if you want to know what God is like, very simple. Look at Christ.
[time=1422] You want to know how Christ, excuse me, you want to know how an invisible God would respond to a person who is dying? Read about it.
[time=1430] In the Gospels Christ shows you. You want to know how an invisible God would respond to an arrogant young ruler who thought the world began and ended with his money? How would the invisible God, living in unapproachable light, address this individual? You want to know? Read the Gospels. Jesus did it.
[time=1450] He did it exactly like God would do it because he is the exact image the exact representation of God. He is God. And he shows us God in forms that we can see and understand. How would the invisible God respond to a woman who is taken out of the act of adultery and brought into his presence? You want to know?
[time=1470] Read the Gospels. That's the point. Christ is God in terms that we can understand.
[time=1478] And in his ministry he addressed marriage and taxes and business issues and religious issues and money issues and anger and betrayal and restitution, I mean everything that would be relevant to human life.
[time=1494] Christ did it and he did it in terms that you and I can get a hold of.
[time=1498] That's why Hebrews 1-3 says Christ is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of God's nature.
[time=1506] What if the sun had no radiance? What if the sun had no radiance? No rays coming our way.
[time=1514] We would look, you know, maybe with protection and we would see a fireball but we would know nothing of its heat.
[time=1522] We would know nothing of its power to cause our crops to grow, etc, etc.
[time=1530] Christ is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his nature. Kind of like if you've had these kind of professors in school who are obviously brilliant, I mean there's no question that they know their stuff, they've been gifted by God, they've written books, but they come into the classroom and you can't understand a word they're saying. Nothing gets past their little rostrum because when they talk it's in terms you can't understand, they're too smart.
[time=1560] But there's this rare professor that you might have had who is both brilliant and understandable and everybody flocks to him because he gives great truth in bite-sized pieces. Christ, Christ.
[time=1576] Great truth, exact representation of the invisible God in terms that you and I can relate to. But notice also in verse 15 it says that he is the first born of all creation. Now first born doesn't have to mean like in time or in sequence. It doesn't mean he was the first in the family of five. It does mean that at points but it also in the Bible means first in terms of rank or place or status. Christ in fact was never created. Being God he always was or always is. In John 8 he says before Abraham was I.M. which is a statement of eternal nature. He always has been and he always will be. This statement, the first born of all creation means this. Christ is prior to distinct from highly exalted above all the created order. He is not the created order. He is first. He is above. He is in a different rank than the created order. And that's important point to make because Jesus so faithfully gives us the invisible God in terms that the human can understand that he took on the form of what?
[time=1652] In order to do that he looked like a creature. The one who wasn't a creature began to look like a creature and smell like a creature and talk like a creature and eat like a creature.
[time=1664] So much so that we must be reminded that he in fact is not a creature. It's this wonderful coming together of God's ability to talk to us in terms we can understand by having Christ in the incarnation but don't for a second misunderstand that that is not a creature. Christ is not a creature.
[time=1684] He is first. He is above. He is distinct from the creation.
[time=1692] So the job is a big one. Saving wicked, sinful people like us from our sins sanctifying us and glorifying us.
[time=1704] That is presented in fact is God. Jesus Christ is God.
[time=1710] But wonderfully he's God in terms. That makes sense.
[time=1714] Now before we go to the second part of the resume just pause for a minute.
[time=1720] Any other contenders for this job? I mean anybody else want to submit your resume? Buddha? Confucius?
[time=1728] Muhammad? Joseph Smith?
[time=1732] Anybody? Want to come try out for the job?
[time=1736] First issue is you're competing against somebody who is God. It's a marvelous truth.
[time=1744] Secondly in our little examination of this resume what has this guy done? Right?
[time=1752] Hey I'm not interested in hiring some raw potential here. I'm not interested in hiring somebody who seems to have all that it would take to get the job done.
[time=1760] This is too important a position for the CEO of Westinghouse.
[time=1764] We're not going to get somebody who we think will be able to do the job.
[time=1768] We want somebody who has done a similar job who can do these kinds of things who has a proven commodity. And so the question is posed in front of Christ what have you done? And you can kind of see the you can kind of see the headhunter coming back to the head company and the headhunter says why I think I've found your man.
[time=1788] Well you won't believe what this guy's done. Well what is it?
[time=1792] Well you know Mount Whitney?
[time=1796] He made it. You know the plains of Texas?
[time=1800] He made those too. Have you ever seen pictures of the Grand Canyon?
[time=1804] He like he dug it. I mean he did it. That's all what he did.
[time=1808] The seven seas? Yeah he did that too.
[time=1812] Look at it. Verse 16 "For by him all things were created both in the heavens and on the earth" My goodness. Everything on the earth. Everything in the heavens.
[time=1824] You know the closest star is 200 billion miles away. He didn't just create Mount Whitney and the wonder and the splendor of our earth. He created everything in the heavens. Even the closest star which is 200 million miles away. Remember that star they called beetle juice? The beetle juice star? The huge star?
[time=1848] The one that is 880 quadrillion miles away?
[time=1852] Now what is that? Don't pretend to understand. Don't go like this. I understand.
[time=1856] We don't understand that. We don't know what that is. 880 quadrillion what? It's diameter. The diameter of this star is bigger than the earth's orbit. The guy that I'm bringing to you for this job he made it. That's the point. That's who this guy is. Are you interested? Are you interested?
[time=1880] Beyond that it goes on in verse 16 not only the things in the earth and not only the things in the heaven. Things that are visible and invisible whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities. So he wants to assure you that he has created everything outside of what you can see. The invisible things and so he draws on thrones, dominions, rulers and authorities which are titles of authority for demons.
[time=1912] He's talking about the spirit world here and he doesn't want you wondering if there wouldn't be a better candidate outside of himself Christ because maybe there's another pantheon of gods out there somewhere that is of a higher order. Maybe there's a rank of spiritual being that supersedes Yahweh of the Old Testament and Christ and if we hire this guy oh we made a mistake because we should have gone all the way to the top. And he is saying that everything you can see Christ did it and everything you can't see even the spiritual beings any suspicion of another order of gods I created everything. Everything.
[time=1956] It did it all. There is no place else to look.
[time=1960] Now what's exciting about this verse is that there are three prepositions in it and they mean something.
[time=1968] In verse 16 it says for by him that could better be translated in him. For in him all things were created now to the back of the verse see at the end of verse 16 all things have been created by him and for him. So there are the three it would read this way. For in him all things were created and all things have been created by him and for him. Now watch this. To say that it was created in him means that he was the one it came out of him the laws that govern the universe and all of creation that came out of him the plan the design the laws the whole thing right out of him. To say that it was by him means that he was the instrumental cause in it all he not only figured it out he energized it he actually did it and then to say that it was for him is obvious the sum total of everything that has ever been created was created for his glory for his pleasure he is the end cause now listen to this I got this out of a little excerpt of a headhunter quote when I am interviewing you I'll probe your professional abilities and experience asking about what you've done. Now just picture the Lord here in this chair being interviewed by this dear headhunter and for every bold claim you make I'll ask you for substantiation I'll ask you to elaborate on the strategies you used the other players involved lessons you've learned in the process and next steps by the time I'm finished I'll know if you really were the prime mover in all those momentous events or just a bystander this is just wonderful this poor person is examining Christ now tell me you're making some bold claims you're a creative person you really think you're a creative person yes I'm a creative person well like what have you well show me some of your creativity well you're sitting on it you know the wood in that chair I made it you know the ground that you're I made it you know how this whole thing hangs in the universe I made the universe I made it at all well well what were your strategies I mean how did you do it well I just spoke
[time=2102] what do you mean you just spoke well I did I just spoke it into it I just said let there be
[time=2108] and then it was oh that's interesting I guess you won't need a personal computer no I won't I'll be fine no secretary needed were there other players involved I mean who helped you
[time=2122] nobody I mean let us I mean the Godhead but I mean now it's you know that's kind of a confusing concept no I just pretty much did it by myself well what lessons did you learn none I didn't learn a thing I didn't make one mistake I knew the beginning from the end and the end from the beginning I just did it and it's perfect and it still is I'm God you get it I mean what would it be like to be sitting in a room with somebody like this it would be unbelievable that's who he is it was all done in him by him and for him all right so that's what he's done but there could be the suspicion that he's lost his touch maybe he's kind of getting rusty maybe he's aging maybe he's not able to keep up with the times and the current changes and the way things need to occur I mean maybe he was maybe he's a has been so the question is what is he doing today look at verse 17 it says and he is before all things and in him all things hold together that's an awesome statement in him all what are you doing now I'm holding everything together well what do you mean you're holding everything together well I mean what I'm doing is I'm holding absolutely everything together well could you be more explicit well yes do you know like how how the earth rotates interviewers says yes well did you realize that if the earth slows down we'd all burn up instantly because too much exposure to the sun and inversely did you realize if the rotation of the earth were to speed up a little bit
[time=2229] we'd all freeze well I'm the one that kind of makes sure that it rotates at the right speed
[time=2235] you know the temperature of the sun yeah you know it's had a particular degree it's been there for like a long long time you realize if it gets a little bit less hot the same thing happens we all freeze if it gets a little warmer same thing happens we all burn up I got the thermostat I mean I'm the guy that keeps that thing I am the thermostat I am what holds that thing together you know how the moon is this exact distance from the earth and that affects our tides
[time=2267] well the reason it stays where it is in relationship with the earth I hold that together
[time=2275] and if I let it come a little too close or go too far away the tides will drown humanity the oceans will break out of their boundaries and wipe out all of humanity I'm holding this thing together and just in case you're wondering like that maybe maybe not into like the big parts of science
[time=2293] by the way at the core at the core
[time=2299] building block the basic most rudimentary building block of all of matter
[time=2305] inside the atom we have these little protons and neutrons
[time=2311] and they have the same electrical charge which means if you've ever put two you know magnets together facing the charges they push apart no atom should ever stay together ever the second it's created it should blow up and the scientists congratulate themselves that they know how to violate that law but they don't know what that law is they don't understand it they don't they don't know why that happens so they come up with this thing called nuclear glue that's their term for this secondary force that holds together what should explode in every single
[time=2345] atom which constitutes all of matter they call it nuclear glue I call it Colossians 117 in him all things old together you understand we are being sustained every moment of every day by the energy of Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ is holding this whole thing together that is what he is doing you say well what else is he doing as if that weren't enough look at verse 18 you want some other evidence that he hasn't lost his touch look at the church verse 18 he is also head of the body the church and he is the beginning the firstborn from the dead if you don't want to look at the wonder of creation then look at the wonder of the creation of the New Testament church and understand that it exists and is held together and is perpetuated and is strong and is effective and does anything of any consequence because Christ is the head and holds it together and drives it which puts some responsibility on our shoulders I mean we become part of the apologetic for the existence of Christ and for his worthiness to hold the position part of the apologetic we cannot diminish his worthiness but we can diminish people's opinion of his worthiness and we stand out as the church Christ is in the process of redeeming people and then sanctifying people and glorifying people that is what is currently giving himself to and by God's grace I hope you can look in your life and say he's doing a phenomenal job despite me I hope we can look at our church corporately and say man he's our head he is our head and he gives us the power to move on that's what it means there in verse 18 he is the first born from the dead again that doesn't mean he's the first person to have ever been resurrected from the dead Lazarus of course among others where before him it means the most important the highest in rank the most significant it is his resurrection power that infuses itself to the church and allows the church to do anything we are nothing as much as the atoms would disintegrate and fall apart without Christ holding them together so any church would utterly disintegrate without the resurrection power of Jesus Christ nothing of consequence could ever happen apart from his being the first born from the dead in John 14 he said it because I live you will live also because Jesus Christ has been resurrected from the dead we have spiritual life direct pipeline from him to us well as I said typically that's all you're going to get in a resume you're going to get maybe a little glimpse of who he is you're going to get an understanding of what he's done you can get some understanding of what he is currently doing but then this last and fourth category which is kind of the whole point of a resume how do I think he'll perform in the future right but that's always conjecture in the human realm that's always your best guess not here guarantees the fourth point here is what will Christ do in the future and you'll find it at the end of verse 18 so that he himself might come to have first place in everything what's that mean that means that there is coming a time when the rebellion on earth and in the heavens will be over the insurrection of sin will finally fully be over it is over in essence because Christ beat death at the cross but it has not played itself out yet in space and time and that's what that means that is going to finish its course rebellion will be over the insurrection of sin will have ended the arrogance of autonomy will be revealed for what it is and then happily every single person how does it read that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of those who are in heaven and on the earth and under the earth that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord that's coming yet and you can you can count on that with this particular applicant to fill this particular job in your life
[time=2611] he will have ultimate total preeminence
[time=2617] you know what so neat about this look at verse 19
[time=2625] God loves it that way God just loves it that way God the Father the one you can't see verse 19 for it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in him the word fullness play Roma in the Greek means this the sum total of all the divine attributes you see in verse 19 he is saying it was the Father's good pleasure for the fullness the sum total of all the divine attributes to dwell in Christ dwell means to be at home to reside and to be comfortable it's not added it's not extra not a facade the fullness of deity is at home in Christ because Christ is God and it is to the pleasure the good pleasure of God the Father God was the Father was not pleased to give that to any human being he was not pleased to give that to any angel any created being he gave it to his son God of Gods king of kings lord of lords so I'm convinced I'm ready to hire him no question to my mind there's only one person there's only one person that I want on the job of my salvation and it's Christ and Christ alone a few short verses a few descriptive phrases take him into a category that is unequaled and unparalleled now by way of application I want you to come to 2 Corinthians chapter 11 for just a minute 2 Corinthians chapter 11 do you remember like for some of you who were able to grow up in Christian homes you would go to sunny school and your teacher would give you like the memory verse of the week well I want to give you the memory phrase of the week because I know you're aging and your memory isn't as strong as it used to be so I don't want to challenge you with a whole verse I know this because mine is here's your memory phrase I want you to memorize this phrase and I want you to take it with you all week long starting verse 2 we'll get to the phrase in a minute 2 Corinthians for I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy for I betrothed you to one husband that to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin verse 3 but I am afraid lest as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness your mind should be led astray from here's the phrase from what the simplicity and purity of devotion to Christ that's it that's what this whole thing is about the simplicity and the purity of devotion to Christ now let me let me put it this way on a personal level it is not enough for you and for me to appreciate the Christology of Colossians 1 but by appreciate I mean to affirm that it is true true and false on a doctoral statement yes yes yes that's not enough that's not the point of this passage it is only it is only properly responded to when the reality of who Christ is invades every aspect of your life now this idea of practicing the presence of Christ you've heard that before maybe you've done it in the past I want to invite you to do it again this week to practice the presence of Christ he is in you he is the hope of glory he is with you he is your friend he is there experience his being there all week long as you're driving in your car to work recognize he is with you when you arrive he is with you when you interact with your family he is there he is a part of it when you recreate when you do your ministry it is with him and for him and through him and by him somehow we must be able better to comprehend his personal presence in our life through the Holy Spirit practice the presence of Christ let me say a second word and this is more on a corporate level more on a corporate level I guess I just want to affirm this truth with you I know this is what you believe I just want you to know let's just affirm this as a church together today that Christ is what this church is all about that's all we are that's all we are as a body of believers we are simply about one thing Jesus Christ the one we've just studied I mean by that we are not about a pastor we are not about a people we are not about programs we are not about a building we are not about a vision we are not about a school we are not about a budget we are all about the person of Jesus Christ now we go about that in certain ways but we can never lose sight
[time=2941] that he is the issue this one that is revealed to us in Colossians 1 is our Lord this one is the one in whom we have put our faith this is the one that we celebrate in baptism right it's Christ that we remember in communion it's Christ that we preach from our pulpit it's Christ that we serve in our various ministries it's Christ that we honor in our financial giving it's Christ that we try to lift up to our children so that they can see him and love him through our school through Awana through our children's ministries it's Christ and wonderfully wonderfully it's Christ that we offer to an unsaved world that's really all we have it's really all we are we are just simply totally bound up the beginning and the end in the simplicity and the purity of devotion to Christ amen let's pray together our gracious God and Heavenly Father as we prayed this morning with the elders many of them had it on their lips to say that they felt unworthy of your salvation that they felt overwhelmed by the goodness the privilege the honor that you had bestowed upon them to be saved to be in relationship with the true and living Christ and now as a corporate family we affirm that same truth from your scriptures we are nothing except Christ he is the beginning and the end he is everything to us he is why we do what we do and we just want to bask in this moment of praising Christ and worshiping Christ and seeing him so clearly and giving him the honor that he is due but we covered it in our hearts to take him with us that he would be honored in all that we would do in these remaining days of the week help us Lord to sense his very presence and live in that way to honor him and glorify him we praise you in Christ's name amen let me invite you to stand as we close our service some amazing things you know are happening here at our church Marv recited a few of them where we don't know what we're doing with this giving stuff I mean what in the world do you realize that we're ahead in the month of January I mean I'm not talking about the spillover from December I'm just talking about giving for the month of January is ahead of budget we don't know when the last time that ever happened this huge response on your part to want to learn to share your faith it's just overwhelming and this coming Sunday seven days from today we're going to try our first outreach service and see what happens well it's our tradition to allow you to respond to what God's doing in your life and if you'd like to come forward this morning and please don't think me sac religious here but if you'd like to put Christ on the job of salvation in your life if you'd like to get that thing squared away
[time=3152] you you you you you you you know history tells us how important it is to have the right man on the job when I think about that my mind goes back to the civil war when our country was being torn apart and historians look back and I think we all do now and we just obviously recognize that Abraham Lincoln was the man for the job his unique background his life experiences his giftedness in leadership his gentle heart his commitment to truth and principle he was the right man for the job and you almost wonder if anyone else could have led our country through that difficult period as successfully as Abraham Lincoln did you bring that thought into a contemporary setting maybe at athletics and we all might think of Michael Jordan as being uniquely gifted I mean he was the man for the job and he absolutely dominated the NBA in his experiences there and as you know world champions over and over and over again and now he's gone and we even begin to appreciate stronger how uniquely he was suited for this particular job called basketball well I guess as you look at your own life as you think about the need in your life for salvation and you recognize that need because you have a sense of emptiness inside no matter how life goes it never seems to be fulfilling as you would hope there is a sense of guilt not that you're the worst person who ever lived but you never seem able to escape that nagging sense that things are not right with God there is shame there is contempt there is a sense of guilt and it eats away at you more times more at sometimes than others but there's kind of a like a low buzz a hum so to speak of that guilt that just is nagging at you constantly you know you need to be saved because as you project into your future as you think about tomorrow or the next month or next year you recognize that without the power of God in your life you're going to repeat some of the same sins the same mistakes you need to change as a human being but you know you're not capable in and of yourself of producing that change because you've tried and you've proven to yourself that you're not strong enough to change yourself and you know you need to be saved because there is a sense of fear associated with death and you may not even think about it very often because it's an unpleasant thought and so you force it out of your mind but in those few moments those rare moments when you are really honest with yourself you dread the thought of death mainly because you don't know about your eternity you combine the sense of guilt and failure and personal sin with the notion of eternity and you don't like the picture that it represents well if anything from today's message I hope you've understood that Christ is uniquely suited to do the work of salvation in your life he is the man for the job but you must ask him to do that work in your life you must open your heart and your life to him and accept him as your personal Lord and Savior or he never goes on the job he never takes the job he is offering to do that but will not force himself on you you must surrender to him and invite him to be the one in your life the one and only to do the work of salvation to forgive you for your sins to give you the strength to live differently and then your hope for all eternity to be forgiven and with God in heaven you can ask the Lord to do that in many different ways but we typically do it by just praying to God and asking him to have Christ be your savior personally accepting Christ and I want to lead you in a little prayer right now that if you would say in your own heart to God he will hear you and in effect you put Christ on the job of salvation in your life if you'd like to pray now invite you to bow your head and follow along in your own heart as I say these words out loud Father I know that I am a sinner I know that I need to be forgiven of my sins I know I need my life to change and I want a hope that in eternity I'll be with you and I understand from God's word today that Christ is truly the only one that can provide that for me as my Savior I invite him into my heart and into my life I put my total faith and trust in Christ as my Savior God thank you for hearing this prayer and for forgiving me of my sins in Jesus name amen.
