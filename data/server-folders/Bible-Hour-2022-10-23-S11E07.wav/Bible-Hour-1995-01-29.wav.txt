[time=0] We try and we labor and we work and we think and we plan and we prepare to take control
[time=9] of life.
[time=13] And maybe for a while when we're out on the practice there and nobody's around and the real circumstances of life are not around, man, we get the notion that we really are
[time=23] getting the knack of taking control, I'm talking about capital C here, not small C control, but real control and then suddenly and unexpectedly the game starts and we find out that we are
[time=37] just not cut out to do this control thing.
[time=47] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=51] We're delighted you've joined us.
[time=53] A lot of us spend a great deal of time and energy trying to gain control of our lives.
[time=60] The thought of being out of control is a frightening one.
[time=63] Well today Pastor Moore explains what to do when life gets out of control, but first
[time=69] let's hear from celebration.
[time=86] And times the Lord of life is healthy and times it seems so hard to bear.
[time=106] But when I feel I'm all alone and that my strength is gone, I know to God in prayer
[time=115] that he is always dead, but times the Lord of life is healthy and times it seems so
[time=132] hard to bear, but when I feel I'm all alone and that my strength is gone, I know to God
[time=144] in prayer that he is always dead, I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, he is there, I go to Jesus,
[time=161] I go to Jesus, he is always there, he is my tower of strength, my refuge from his stare,
[time=174] I go to God in prayer, he is always dead.
[time=182] When life has left you feeling lovely, when life has filled you with despair, just come
[time=200] to God in prayer that he is always dead, I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, he is there,
[time=221] I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, he is always there, he is my tower of strength, my refuge
[time=237] from his stare, I go to God in prayer, I go to God in prayer, he is always there.
[time=250] I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus
[time=277] , he is always there, I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, he is there, I go to Jesus, I go
[time=293] to Jesus, he is always there, he is my tower of strength, my refuge from his stare, I go
[time=306] to God in prayer, I go to God in prayer, I go to God in prayer, I go to God in prayer,
[time=322] he is always there, he is always there. Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to
[time=338] welcome you to the Bible Hour and thank you for joining us today. Well, it's a very special Sunday for us. It's one of our outreach Sundays and we have been telling you about it and finally it's here, it's a whole new format and it's designed to reach out to those who don't know Christ or who might not have a church background and so the service is a slightly different feel. One of the elements in the service is a drama which I refer to in the message but we're not able to put it on the air for copyright reasons but we have
[time=367] just had a tremendous opportunity preparing for this and looking forward to how God will use it. Our next outreach service will be February 26th and we want to invite you to come and be a part of that. If you don't have a church home and you'd like to experience a non-traditional kind of exciting different format, we'd love to have you. Well now let's go back to the normally scheduled portion of our program.

[time=972] We'll return to more of the Bible Hour in a moment, but here's a question for you. Do you have problems that seem to be too great to bear? Perhaps you wonder if there's any way out of the mess you're in? Well right now the Bible Hour is offering free to all who write this booklet written by Jay Adams called Christ and Your Problems. Jay offers real hope. You'll gain courage to take
[time=992] responsible action knowing that there's real solutions found in God's Word. Stay tuned, I'll give you our address at the end of the program. You know as attractive as it seems in that drama,
[time=1003] that main character, wouldn't it be wonderful? And isn't it an attractive prospect to be
[time=1009] in control? I mean really truly to have the resources to handle whatever comes your way.
[time=1017] But I think as attractive as that prospect is, it is equally elusive.
[time=1024] Really gaining control, it's a very elusive thing. I go back in my mind to a friend in elementary
[time=1033] school named Kirk, Kirk Letterholm, and somehow some way he fell in love with the notion of being
[time=1040] a professional basketball player. He could see it now, he was going to make his way into junior high,
[time=1046] through high school, then to college, and eventually he would be on TV doing the thing.
[time=1051] And he did more than dream, he worked. And my memory almost without exception, after school he
[time=1059] would go home, he would change his clothes, he would get a snack, he would grab his basketball, and he would come back to the playground. We lived in Southern California, so weather was rarely a factor. And he was there all the time. And as I would go by doing whatever I was doing, you would hear the bounce, bounce, bounce, chain of the net, or the thought of the backboard.
[time=1079] And that just rings in my mind as a memory that was constant for about a year.
[time=1084] We noticed that Kirk was making progress, and he would tell us, and we would watch. I mean the
[time=1093] guy who got to the place where 10 out of 10 from the foul line was a possible thing on a regular basis. And then 12 out of 15 coming back from the three-point line, or the top of the key at that
[time=1104] time. I mean there was marked improvement in his ability to put that ball in that hoop.
[time=1108] The reality of the story, however, is this. When we lined up, remember that awkward terrifying
[time=1116] moment as an elementary school, when you actually had to line up and pick teams, whether or not you were going to get picked. Kirk, despite the effort, despite the work,
[time=1126] despite the progress, was typically picked last or next to last. Because there was a
[time=1132] significant limitation in his life. Kirk was short. Kirk never grew past five foot two inches,
[time=1138] even as an adult. So you can imagine what it must have been like as an elementary person.
[time=1143] And while with no one on the court defending him, he would have been maybe our first pick
[time=1150] for a shot. When you put just the un-experienced, the un-practiced, the uncommitted average
[time=1156] other elementary kid there who wasn't short, he could never get a shot off. It was impossible.
[time=1161] He just had to stand there and he couldn't shoot. And then when the other team would get the ball, even though the team players may not have practiced like Kirk had practiced, he was completely unable to defend them, and they could score almost at will.
[time=1176] Now I kind of lost track of Kirk for a couple of years there through junior high, but then we ended up in high school together and I didn't see him with a basketball anymore.
[time=1185] I saw him with a horn. And I don't know who it was, whether it was his mom or his dad or a
[time=1193] faithful teacher or a good friend or just the kind of the learning through the school or hard knocks thing, but somehow, some way he got the message that he was trying to do something he was
[time=1204] not cut out to do. He was trying to succeed in an area that was beyond his limitations and,
[time=1210] despite the effort, he would never, never be successful at that. But man, could he do this.
[time=1218] It was awesome. It was awesome. First chair in our high school band, and we loved it when Kirk
[time=1225] would light it up. He eventually got a scholarship, went to college, became a music teacher, and to
[time=1231] this day is finding that because of a major shift of emphasis out of what he could never do was not
[time=1238] cut out to do into what he actually could do, fulfillment and joy and excitement and success.
[time=1244] And could you imagine, could you imagine the frustration, the endless frustration,
[time=1250] had he not made the shift, had he not kind of reached the breaking point and finally admitted
[time=1257] I can't do this thing, but if to this very day he were still walking around with a basketball
[time=1263] five foot two inches tall thinking someday I'm gonna play in the NBA. We would see it boil over
[time=1270] at points towards the end as the anger and the frustration would build. What another waste of
[time=1276] his life it would have been, but thankfully the breaking point came and he started to apply his
[time=1282] energies and his talents and his discipline to something that was consistent with who he was.
[time=1288] Sometimes I think this way about control. Sometimes I think that as humanity I mean human
[time=1296] beings all of us together on this globe we get to trying working very hard at something and we
[time=1303] take our discipline and we take our resources and we take what we are which is significant stuff and we say we're gonna get control, we're gonna handle this thing and the drug problem we're gonna figure
[time=1314] that out and the child abuse thing we're gonna figure that one out too and the weather problems well we're gonna learn to predict them and minimize that stuff but we'll make it so it's as if we're in control and we can really I think as a whole human race be striving for something that we were
[time=1332] not created to do and therefore will never really never really achieve. We don't need to look any
[time=1339] further for information on this than our own headlines. Those folks over in Japan what a
[time=1346] horrible thing has happened in Kobe is that how you say it you realize that in Japan in 1923 there
[time=1353] was this enormously terrifying destructive earthquake some 140,000 people died that earthquake I think
[time=1361] was on September 1st and and so what they do now every September 1st because they are determined
[time=1368] they are determined to get this thing under control. They use all of that wonderful self-discipline
[time=1375] that we think of when we think of the Japanese and they they rehearse on September 1st the kids
[time=1381] are running through the drills and they they run them through pipes with smoke and handkerchiefs to simulate the kind of distress situations that they may experience. They take their military, their soldiers, their police, their medical people and they practice on that day how to evacuate people by helicopter how to get supplies in how to handle the water problems how to handle the heat problems how to handle the shelter problems they go through all that stuff they have the strict
[time=1405] this building codes in the world they they don't lag behind anybody in this category if you're going to build a building over there you're going to build it as they would say or might have said earthquake proof or resistant and so they have put the stuff the toughest stuff they can they have
[time=1420] seismic monitors criss-crossing their little island country because they don't want an earthquake to
[time=1428] derail the bullet when it's going a hundred and sixty miles an hour and so these seismic monitors
[time=1434] are immediately connected to shut that bullet down the second the thing starts to move the earth
[time=1440] starts to shake. One article I was reading said this the Japanese have always walked around with
[time=1447] an attitude that severe earthquake damage could never happen to us set an American seismologist
[time=1455] attending a conference on earthquakes in Osaka the week before this most recent earthquake occurred
[time=1463] after the Northridge California quake a year ago Japan's construction ministry even boasted
[time=1469] that US freeway designs are different read the article said inferior are different read inferior
[time=1476] hours he insisted are safe and you've seen the pictures 20 seconds of terror shattered that
[time=1483] complacently complacency suddenly decades of assumptions about which seismic zones are dangerous
[time=1489] about earthquake resistance and about the adequacy of relief plans collapsed like the stucco
[time=1495] and tile roofed homes in Kobe's hard hit area you realize 20 seconds of shaking and 5,000 people
[time=1505] are dead 50,000 buildings hit the dirt 300,000 individuals are without a home
[time=1513] many of them without food without water and without immediate shelter despite the preparation
[time=1519] and they're talking between 30 and 80 now this number I don't understand 30 and 80 billion dollars
[time=1526] of damage and repairs wow you know when are we going to get it that we can't do this thing called
[time=1535] control capital C and if you don't think that the people in Japan want to tell you about it then go
[time=1541] ask the people in my home state California because I'll tell you they deal with the earthquake then they deal with the fire and I was just there in the flooding a couple of weeks ago almost lost my sister in this flood in doing a very basic thing around the property there almost drowned in a
[time=1558] creek what are we going to get it that we we have an ability to do the small C thing we have a we
[time=1568] have a type of control that is good and it's helpful but it almost can deceive us and lure us
[time=1576] into believing something that isn't true that we could eventually have the capital C and maybe
[time=1583] we're headed down the wrong path on this one maybe we're spending a lot of time and a lot of energy trying to be Lord of our lives by that I mean capital C total control and maybe that's just not
[time=1595] possible maybe it's just not in the cards I have of course I'm not trying to anyway degrade the
[time=1603] Japanese and their progress we're thankful for them we're thankful for their insights we've learned from them and many of these points but you got to face it this earthquake over there was was not the biggest one that could have come it was seven point two on the Richter scale we can go to eights we can go to nines and you know the thing goes exponentially I mean it didn't even take a a huge one it was it was large but it wasn't surprisingly large
[time=1629] well let me give you something to think about this one let me put a proposition out here on the table and see if we can't think about it a little bit I want to say it this way because
[time=1638] we are human beings and not gods because we are human beings there are limitations that come
[time=1646] with this humanness that make absolute control completely elusive impossible to attain therefore
[time=1658] unworthy to pursue I want to suggest to you that and maybe I stand against many
[time=1666] voices in our society it would say otherwise I want to say to you that as humans we can't really capital C be in control of anything if you just think about it for a minute and I the first let me
[time=1677] break let me break anything down let's start with um let's start with our circumstances
[time=1684] I really don't I really don't believe that we are capital C in control of our circumstances I
[time=1690] certainly know that I am not maybe you can relate to this I am not in control of the price of lettuce
[time=1696] somebody else figures that one out and I have no influence on it and if I'm going to eat lettuce I'm going to bite at that price or grow it myself but I'm not changing the price that's basically out of my control I cannot control when I am driving home from work and I get stuck in a traffic jam
[time=1714] there is nothing I can do about that and oftentimes I think there is so I look for an alternate route and I find out the traffic jam exists there as well I can't even control the lights to get them to go
[time=1724] my way and sometimes they frustratingly go consistently the wrong way and I am pained to realize again
[time=1730] I am not in control of my circumstances I am not in control of the fact that the paint on my house
[time=1737] two miles from here as we speak is oxidizing okay and it's been oxidizing since it got put on and
[time=1744] it's going to continue to oxidize until it chips and it peels I'm going to have to scrape it and I'm going to have to repaint it and then that new paint going to start oxidizing again out of my control out of my control I cannot control the fact that the rubber on my brand new Christmas
[time=1762] presents from my wife my new Nike running shoes you see every time I put them on every time I go anywhere them I wear them out and that's just what happens to use them is to wear them out I can't control that I can't come up with a different kind of rubber I can't change those particular properties that's out of my control to use them is to wear them out I wish I could buy one pair the rest of my life I never have to buy them again it's out of my control I can't do stuff like that
[time=1788] when I'm walking in the forest I cannot control the animals in the forest as much as I would like
[time=1794] and you know couldn't you see it I would have the the buck and the doves run through this way and then I would have the squirrels come over here and then I would have the hawk fly through I mean I would just have the greatest walk the world has ever seen if I could control these little critters I can't if they show up they show up if they don't I don't see them they are out of my
[time=1815] control now let's go beyond these kinds of things out there let's talk about people because they
[time=1821] make up a big part of my circumstances and as I think they do yours do you realize that I cannot control I cannot control the way that teacher I have five kids three of them are in school I cannot
[time=1833] control the way the teacher talks to my daughter I have no power over oh yes you do you have a small city yes it's true I can take them out of that school and put them in another school where they promptly would find another what teacher who I am equally out of control of I can't I can't
[time=1848] force that that person to interact with my child in any particular way I can't I can't control the
[time=1855] way people treat my kids I can't control the way the lady at the bank treats my wife I can get a
[time=1861] different bank but then all he gets a different lady and I'm out of control again small sea capital sea but here's what I find so interesting I can't even control my own kids
[time=1872] right not only can I not control the way the teacher controls the kid relation to my kid
[time=1879] I can't control my own flesh and blood that lives in my house now we live in harmony most of the time
[time=1886] and and and you know I try to do that out of love and I try not to use that bullhorn thing too often
[time=1895] but when you come right down to it sometimes I can control their behavior sometimes
[time=1901] but I have found it's impossible to control their moods that's out of my reach
[time=1907] and I have found that it is impossible to control their attitudes it's impossible to control their thoughts and how they choose to view a situation how they choose
[time=1917] to view me I can't do it out of my control I can't control my wife I mean you know
[time=1925] my own wife who again we live in harmony we live in love we have a wonderful relationship you know what I'm out of control when it comes to things like her attitudes her mood what she wants
[time=1939] to do you know what I'm saying you know what I'm saying look around you look at the people in your life they have a huge impact on your circumstances your boss your friends those who work for you
[time=1950] your family members and you know what we are unable to do the control thing with them we may we may have a facade of it but in reality they are over there and we are over here
[time=1962] I am not in control of my circumstances secondly and this one's kind of obvious but I am not in control of this thing called death
[time=1978] I'm not in control of my destiny you know death plays a perfect game it's never lost anybody who's ever done the death thing always loses everybody who's ever lived has always died I don't see why I'm gonna be any different death always wins and death has this like weird propensity to show up at like unexpected times
[time=2000] in unexpected ways I not only can't control if I'm going to die I get I don't get the control
[time=2006] when I'm gonna die or how I'm gonna die unless of course suicide small c but can I beat death
[time=2012] can I be in control of death capital c absolutely not I might be gone by evening you might be gone by evening and it's not in your control it's not in
[time=2021] my control except the exception of suicide which is only a small c over the over the holidays there I had the privilege of visiting a person who who was in his own home now and in a hospital bed they brought into his own
[time=2036] home because there it was hopeless and I was able to share some scriptures and talk a little bit about heaven but you know what this guy in September finds out for the very first time in his life
[time=2047] that anything might be wrong just September here by November and December he's in a bed in his own
[time=2054] house because the doctors have sent him home I was there late December I go on a trip to California
[time=2061] for a few days I come back and this guy's gone he's dead death wins and it was unbelievable because
[time=2068] 41 year old guy and I could see him in his bed there he was sitting up and had big strong shoulders and and though the disease was taking its toll the cancer but he was you could still see his frame and I noticed his basketball shoes by his bed they were big you know you could see he had this strong strapping guy on your hands and I asked him about his life and and he was so
[time=2087] strong and so healthy that he even defended our principles over in Vietnam he fought for us he was a side gunner there in one of the helicopters boy as I drove to his home
[time=2099] I see this beautiful home I see a lake behind that was his lake and then some trees behind that
[time=2106] come inside meet his wife was terrified by his 125 pound German Shepherd dog
[time=2113] and I'm thinking this guy had it all absolutely everything he wanted he loved the fish he loved
[time=2119] the honey loved his wife he loved his dog he loved his job sorry small sea small sea
[time=2126] we can't control that we may as well own up to that just admit it
[time=2132] there's another thing that I as I as I think through this that I have to be honest with myself
[time=2139] I'm saving this one for last because maybe it'll be the most difficult to comprehend but or face up to but you know what I can't control myself I can't even control myself much as my circumstances or my destiny
[time=2156] I was getting a drift on this one when I was in high school came home from basketball practice
[time=2162] and my feet were just in pain and they'd been that way for months and and the skin on the bottom of my feet was just wearing out because you know stopping and starting there in a basketball game and I eventually showed up to my folks and they take me to the doctor what happens is they think I was born with normal feet but then as I continued to grow excuse me as I continued to grow the arches in my feet kind of started coming up and pretty
[time=2185] soon I had such a cute arches that to do normal activity literally wore the skin right off my feet
[time=2193] well I had to have a surgery had to have operation on both feet they cut the muscles put me in braces to square these why couldn't I have been in control hey muscles stop it now you're my muscles
[time=2203] this is my body I'm in control you stop it you just go know it nice and normal not flat but just
[time=2209] normal out of my control absolutely completely out of my control few years later I'm looking
[time=2216] forward to football camp me and my buddies man we've got plans to win this thing this big league thing and so we're going to go this summer to this really neat football camp with a whole bunch of professional players and college coaches and get our stuff together we're going to win our season man we all worked out hard all summer and two weeks prior to that camp I was in as good
[time=2233] a shape as I'd ever been really healthy and I get an intestinal disease type thing and in a week's
[time=2242] time and then the fault those two weeks there I lose 14 pounds now I had no body fat at this
[time=2248] particular time in my life you know 17 years old wouldn't it be nice to have those days back but point is here you got nobody fat boy losing 14 pounds in two weeks I couldn't have gone to
[time=2260] that camp if I wanted to I couldn't get out of bed I was just out can't control my life I can't
[time=2266] control myself I can't get myself to do what myself is supposed to do I really when you think
[time=2272] about I got a small seat can I say walk from here to the edge of the stage yes I mean right now I can tell myself to do that and I am small seat in control of myself but if I just back up one
[time=2282] pace from that yeah big see huh uh it's out of my reach and then I guess if we were going to be
[time=2291] honest with ourselves we'd look at other areas where we don't control ourselves and I would admit to you that I wish I had a point in my life where I could say I made a decision to control this area
[time=2301] I'm no longer selfish it was back in 1982 and I'm never going to be selfish again
[time=2307] I wish I could say that that I could do that I know that I have said I don't want to be selfish
[time=2313] anymore and I think it's ugly and it hurts people and I wish I were different and I want to be different and I'm going to work to be different but I want to be honest with you I'm still selfish I'm in that sense out of control it gets the best of me it takes my best efforts and it reduces them
[time=2329] to rubble I wish I could say to you that I made a decision back in 1979 never to say an unkind
[time=2337] unloving unhealthy statement that wouldn't build people up and be the right thing for the moment that can control this little thing in my mouth called my tongue I'll tell you what same thing I've tried I want to I'm going to keep trying to I think I ought to I think my tongue is dangerous I think it hurts people am I in capital C no way no way I can't control myself I can't control
[time=2365] my circumstances and I really can't control my destiny I think I think that because I'm a human
[time=2373] being I think that because I was created as a human being I have limitations I am not God
[time=2380] and I think that part of me getting healthy and whole is kind of coming to that realization
[time=2386] and admitting that there's a guy in the Bible named David now David was no sniveling unsuccessful
[time=2396] kind of little guy over there in the corner wishing nobody would look at him David was a king he was the king of the nation of Israel he was a mighty warrior he was brave he had an accomplishment that list that went with his name a million miles long he was loved by the people when he would ride through the streets they would applaud him they would adore him because he was successful he brought prosperity to their land he kept order he he was an architect I mean the guy was just
[time=2421] David King David listen to what he said about himself
[time=2429] David said this in Psalm 39 Lord make me to know my end and what is the extent of my days
[time=2436] let me know how transient I am surely every man at his best is a mere breath a breath
[time=2443] surely every man walks about as a phantom surely they make an uproar for nothing
[time=2449] that's the cry of a wounded heart that's the cry of a heart that's looked honestly at life
[time=2457] who they are what they can and cannot do and said hey please punctuate that in my thinking God
[time=2463] punctuate that in my reality make me know how the end that I will die make that clear to me not
[time=2471] in a morbid sense but in a healthy wholesome sense that I am not eternal I don't I don't get to determine that I get to live for however long I want make me know how transient I am that's a interesting picture isn't it someone who never really builds a home someone who never really has a job someone who never really has a bank account transient just kind of floating through help me understand that despite my success I am still human and I'm really kind of just a transient floating across the pages of history here help me understand that I am a breath
[time=2499] which isn't very you know there's not a lot of substance to a breath is the point I think I think it's time to kind of step up to the plate and say I really am willing to acknowledge
[time=2513] that I cannot be in capital C control and frankly my small C control has pretty severe limitations
[time=2521] cry as David cried God teach me that help me to understand it help that makes sense to me
[time=2530] because then he goes on to say he says this I love you oh lord my strength
[time=2541] the lord is my rock my fortress and my deliverer my god is my rock and who I take refuge he is my
[time=2548] shield and the horde of my salvation my stronghold you see when you give up the illusion of personal
[time=2556] control personal total capital C control and you come over here where you belong as the Bible
[time=2562] would say we belong over here we we are not the creator we are the creature and and he really is in control Jesus Christ is called lord in the Bible lord of all he has said he created the
[time=2573] heavens and the earth he holds them together and it all fits under his plan come over here where
[time=2580] David did and said oh god I don't have what it takes I'm a breath I'm a phantom
[time=2587] and now knowing that I can approach you and and say I love you and let you be my strength
[time=2596] when I stop trying to be my strength let you be my refuge when I stop trying to be my refuge let you be in control when I stop pretending that I am in control it's a wonderful thing it's making or recognizing the fact that Christ is lord and coming underneath that
[time=2616] well what difference will that make you say okay I'm over here today you're talking to me about
[time=2623] coming over here where I confess Christ as lord I admit what I'm not I admit what I am and I start
[time=2629] applying my energies and my efforts to what I am what does that do what does that look like well let's go back through these three circumstances you acknowledge Christ as lord in your life you
[time=2641] submit to him you say you're in charge I'm not what happens to your circumstances I wish I could say
[time=2648] that when you do that they all go roses up I wish I could say that there's like a guarantee in the bible somewhere that when you give your life to god that then from then on every single circumstance in your life happens just like you like it but that is certainly not true that couldn't be further from the truth we've been working and praying and celebrating over the
[time=2668] life of one of the people in our church nine years ago he was over there pretending that he
[time=2675] could be in control his wife however was a christian and had given her life to the control of god
[time=2681] but she developed a brain tumor and it rocked his world because he had a really good job and a
[time=2689] really good bank account and really good health and really liked his life but it was one of those breaking points where it was a personal thing with him like I'm not in control because the thing I love the most I can't control because I don't know what's going on inside there and that brain tumor is out of my reach and because of that trying kind of wake up call in his life he moved
[time=2710] from being over there pretending he could be in control acknowledging he had no control capital C and became a christian now I wish I could tell you as does everybody else in our church
[time=2721] that nothing you know it was all happily that for after from there well they treated the brain
[time=2727] tumor it went away for a while but about 18 months ago it reared its ugly ugly head again
[time=2734] and it took her life so you're saying what in the world do I want to come over here for
[time=2744] if I'm going to have the same problems if I come over here as if I don't come over here why come over here the answer is very clear God says and when you give your life to him he will work every
[time=2757] single circumstance in your life according to his perfect purpose in your life or his glory
[time=2765] and for your ultimate well-being vis-a-vis we are no longer left to chance and circumstance
[time=2775] and fate and what is this all that up to anyway and it seems when you just read across the headlines
[time=2782] as if it's just a somebody just took trouble and just sprayed it out on humanity and it lands on some and doesn't land on others and it's just this unbelievable mess and there's no way to interpret it there's no assurances that it will be for any good at all and that's passed through any grid before it touches your life circumstances are different when you're over here not because
[time=2805] you don't have cancer problems and financial problems and all the other issues we're talking about this morning but there is the confidence and the assurance and the promise of God that he will only allow those things to come into your life as hard as some of them may be
[time=2820] according to his purpose I think that changes things I think one of the worst places in life to be
[time=2830] is to have to be left to the winds of chance aimless secondly you come over here and you give your
[time=2843] life to God acknowledge Christ as Lord it radically changes your destiny now again I wish I could say
[time=2852] that you get to pick the time and place of your death and you made as late as you want 102 in your
[time=2858] sleep painless that is not true the Bible never says that and I am as prone to die being over here
[time=2866] today as if I were over here I there are no guarantees here is the guarantee that death
[time=2876] instead of being a cul-de-sac and a frightening terrifying end of life and if you can't even
[time=2884] control how you're gonna die how are you gonna control what happens to you after you die instead of it being this harsh cold reality that ends any sense of your own sense of small sea and opens
[time=2895] up more questions death becomes a gateway to heaven eternal life to be in the presence of God
[time=2906] that's why some of the writers say of the New Testament said I don't know whether it's better to be alive here with you or to be dead and go to heaven because they are aware that death is not a cul-de-sac death is the thing you pass through so you can live forever with God
[time=2921] because you've given your life to God heaven what is heaven I mean if if the destiny is heaven what is that well there are a number
[time=2932] of words that describe it I won't give them all to you let me give you a few and see if this isn't appealing heaven is called a city and by a city it doesn't mean that you come up to it and there's
[time=2942] that's a city sign a heaven population such and such by city it means community it means people
[time=2949] living together in perfect harmony and joy and love and I think we all understand what that is
[time=2956] about we don't get it as much as we would like but few of us would deny the fact that when you when you're with your friends and the thing is clicking whatever that is if it's for you if it's the weather or if it's a good ballgame or if it's a great talk over coffee you know that's something that community thing that happens and you go now that is good when God describes heaven as a city
[time=2976] he's saying that's what it is that's what it's about God also says that heaven has walls around
[time=2984] it now again I don't think that means that they're like big walls I think that is an effort on God's
[time=2990] part to communicate the sense of security that happens for people when they're in heaven
[time=2996] walls are protective walls keep the bad stuff out and the good stuff in and heaven is a place of absolute total security God's protection in your life where the things we
[time=3010] are now subject to can no longer reach or touch or harm us we are beyond all of that we are safely
[time=3016] inside the protection of heaven Jesus said that I will prepare a mansion for you in heaven and
[time=3026] you're thinking well now what kind of a mansion I mean is it going to be Tudor or is it going to be like you know modern I mean now how will he know what I want I mean as far as what I've seen I don't think it's all about that I think here's the point God is saying when you get to heaven I am going to give you personal attention
[time=3044] it's not just going to be this mass of people in community protected by walls there's going to be an individual commitment on my part to you as an individual to have you have a place that is your
[time=3054] own I will care for you individually forever heaven is also described as having a river a river
[time=3064] and I believe what is being communicated there is the satisfaction the never-ending
[time=3070] satisfaction you drink water when you're really thirsty and you have a sense of all that met the need I'm satisfied until you get thirsty again that's why the river the river never stops
[time=3080] heaven is a place of absolute total joy and satisfaction well that's what happens to your circumstances it'll still be hard things there's no doubt about
[time=3095] that but God's purpose will be in them and you'll know it and he'll give you the strength to fight through them with meaning and purpose your destiny will be radically different and you'll know and be confident of your destiny because it rests in the hands of God
[time=3109] because you have declared Christ the Lord of your life and the last one up there you give Christ's lordship in your life and he begins to change you real change I mean substantial
[time=3124] change as I mentioned it doesn't mean you become sendless it doesn't mean you can't still struggle
[time=3130] but when you become a Christian Christ comes into your heart and he changes things inside
[time=3136] there and he takes up his residence there through the power of the Holy Spirit and the word of God
[time=3142] becomes this great resource of wisdom and strength and the people of God become those who would cheer
[time=3148] you on to continue to grow and you'll walk with God and change the way you talk and change the way
[time=3154] you act and best of all when you when you have Christ as your Lord there's total forgiveness for
[time=3163] your sins excuse me total forgiveness for your sins all the things that I have done wrong and I
[time=3171] have done many wrong things I have done many sinful things and I don't want to stand before God and try to answer for what I have done I want to be able to stand before God and say the sacrifice
[time=3183] and the provision for what I have done is in your son and he is my Lord I have given my life to him
[time=3189] there's forgiveness complete and total forgiveness
[time=3196] so I'm inviting you over here if you've been over here at least to consider being over here
[time=3203] the pros and the cons I want to close with a little poem
[time=3210] do you know the Invictus the Invictus was written by William Ernest Henley who died about 1902
[time=3216] the Invictus is the poem that people on this side of the equation have lifted up kind of it's kind
[time=3222] of a literary statue that I will not give my life to the Lord I will stay the Lord and if I die
[time=3230] staying the Lord so be it but I'd like to read it and have you listen to it in light of what we've
[time=3236] talked about it's as far as poems go it's wonderful as far as the truth it conveys
[time=3242] it's questionable it begins this way out of the night that covers me black as the pit from pole to
[time=3250] pole I thank whatever God may be for my unconquerable soul
[time=3257] in the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud under the bludgeonings of
[time=3266] chance my head is bloody but unbowed in other words just bring it on make it as hard as you want
[time=3275] you will not conquer my soul and I will not bow my head I'm committed to my illusion
[time=3282] then it goes this beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade
[time=3290] obviously death and yet the minutes of the years finds and shall find me unafraid I taunt death
[time=3298] big deal it matters not excuse me as he closes it matters not how straight the gate how charged with
[time=3307] punishment the scroll I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul
[time=3321] I don't know as for me I prefer David's poem Lord make me to know my end and what is the
[time=3331] extent of my days let me know how transient I am surely every man that is best is a mere breath
[time=3338] surely every man walks about as a phantom surely they make an uproar for nothing and then he says this I didn't read this last time listen this and now lord for what do I wait my hope is in the
[time=3351] deliver me from all my transgressions
[time=3359] making this decision as kirk did in his way from this side of the equation to this side of the
[time=3368] equation is an acknowledgement that you are not in capital c and as a small c person you belong
[time=3376] over here worshiping the one who is and in fact you're only hope for real purpose for an eternal
[time=3383] destiny of joy and for any hope to deal with who you are as an individual and productive and powerful
[time=3389] ways comes through your relationship with the lord of lords and the king of kings
[time=3395] and that's as simple as opening your heart as the song said in praying to god because he's always
[time=3401] there offering Christ to come into your heart to be your lord a forgiveness of sins and commit
[time=3408] yourself the following his direction you know the exciting thing about giving control of your life
[time=3429] to the lord jesus christ is that it can be done as simply as a prayer and i want to pray now for a
[time=3435] moment and lead you in a prayer that if you'd like to follow along in your own heart if you say this to god god i'll hear you christ will come into your heart and be your lord and savior let's pray together father i know that i'm a sinner i know that i need your help i know that i am not
[time=3450] ultimately in control of anything in my life and i want christ to be in total control and i want
[time=3456] to submit to his lordship in my life i ask him to be my savior today to forgive me for my sins and
[time=3462] a guide and lead and direct me and i thank you for saving me in christ and i pray this in jesus name
