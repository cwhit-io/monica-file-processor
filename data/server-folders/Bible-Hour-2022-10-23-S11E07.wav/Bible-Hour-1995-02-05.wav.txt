[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=11] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=13] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=15] Today our special guest speaker is Dr. Jay Kessler, president of Taylor University.
[time=20] His message is taken from the book of Matthew, chapters 24 and 25.
[time=25] But first, let's join our service as the sanctuary choir sings, "Oh, We Worship." (upbeat music)
[time=34] [MUSIC - 210 seconds]
[time=258] - We'll return to more of the Bible hour in a moment, but here's a question for you.
[time=262] Do you have problems that seem to be too great to bear?
[time=265] Perhaps you wonder if there's any way out of the mess you're in.
[time=268] Well, right now, the Bible hour is offering free to all who write this booklet written by Jay Adams, called Christ and Your Problems.
[time=275] Jay offers real hope.
[time=277] You'll gain courage to take responsible action, knowing that there's real solutions found in God's Word.
[time=283] Stay tuned, I'll give you our address at the end of the program.
[time=287] (gentle music)
[time=495] - Hi, my name's Russell Moore, and I wanna welcome you to the Bible hour, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=500] We're excited about a guest speaker today, Dr. Jay Kessler.
[time=504] He's gonna minister to us from God's Word, and it's always wonderful to know that the man whom God brings before us has such a strong, long-lasting, enduring testimony as Dr. Jay Kessler does.
[time=518] Years and years ago, he was instrumental as the executive director, president, and leader of Youth for Christ.
[time=525] And in those formative years, really gave it vision and direction and raised it to a profile, and thousands and thousands of young people have come to Christ through Jay's ministry and those who worked with him in Youth for Christ, and are today transformed by the power of God.
[time=541] And we're thankful that Youth for Christ goes on, even today, based on, in part, the strong foundation that Jay was able to give it through God's power.
[time=549] As you probably know, Jay is now the president of Taylor University, the main campus in Upland, Indiana, and, of course, we're thankful here in Fort Wayne for the Extension campus here in Fort Wayne.
[time=561] And what a tremendous group of faculty they have, the new executive director here in our town is Bob Neenheis, a wonderful man, godly committed to Christ, and we understand from them that the ministry is just exploding on them.
[time=574] They've had a record enrollment, and they're thankful for that, and we rejoice with them in that wonderful news.
[time=580] So today, our guest speaker is not just someone who knows things about the Bible.
[time=584] He's a man who has been used of God greatly and wonderfully through his faithful life, and we'll speak to us, I'm sure, out of the experience of walking with God.
[time=593] Also want you to know, we're excited about a service that is coming up here in the life of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=599] The last Sunday in February, February 26, that both are normally scheduled Sunday morning times.
[time=605] We're going to be having a special outreach service.
[time=608] It'll be a completely different format than we would normally have.
[time=613] The word will be taught, but the whole service will be designed for the unbeliever, and so the music will be different than normal.
[time=619] There'll be a drama that will tie into the theme of our day and then a message.
[time=623] Our theme is, "It's not my fault," which is, I think, is a very common thought that runs through many of our minds.
[time=630] And as I say, the whole service will be designed to touch and reach the unsaved person.
[time=636] And maybe you're in that category.
[time=637] Maybe you're just investigating the claims of Christ, or maybe you're saved, but have a friend who isn't, and you're wishing you could expose them to the claims of the gospel in a very relevant and contemporary way.
[time=650] That's the kind of service we're planning and hoping God will give us on February 26, right here at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=656] And you don't have to be a member to come to our church, you don't have to be a regular attender, you don't even have to know anybody.
[time=662] Just take this as my invitation to you to come and join us, particularly on that Sunday, but obviously on any other Sunday.
[time=669] We're excited about what God is doing in and through Black Hawk as we have an opportunity to reach the city for Christ.
[time=675] In our last outreach service, we saw over 1,900 people come and be a part of bringing their unsaved friends and hearing the gospel and rejoicing in the good news that God has given us a savior.
[time=688] So we make that a warm and strong invitation to those of you who would wanna join us.
[time=693] Well, now we go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our program and anticipate the instruction from God's word from Dr. J. Kessler.
[time=701] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 326 seconds]
[time=1036] (audience applauds)
[time=1054] - Thank you, Michelle.
[time=1055] I'm always thankful for the preparation that people are willing to put in.
[time=1059] That took Michelle a lot of work to train her voice to do those things and then to learn that song as well.
[time=1066] And Dr. Kessler has been preparing for a lot of years to come here and preach to us.
[time=1072] As God has been training him since the mid-1950s as a servant of his to come and share with people like us.
[time=1081] And on a daily basis provide leadership for Taylor University as he is president there has been since 1985.
[time=1089] In the first service I mentioned that I often like to introduce people by talking about their least significant events first and I guess the least significant thing he's done is write 19 books.
[time=1101] That tells me a lot about how significant he's been.
[time=1103] Like I said, he started with Youth for Christ in 1955 and ended up being president there until 1985 and then took over the presidency.
[time=1114] But that's not what has impressed me most.
[time=1117] He and his wife Jane have parented three children and raised them, have nine grandchildren.
[time=1124] And more than that have influenced the rearing and training up of millions of children across the country through his books and through the Youth for Christ ministry and around the world as well.
[time=1136] I'm grateful for that.
[time=1137] But even more than that, I have had the privilege of being with him a couple other times in settings that he wouldn't recall I wouldn't expect him to.
[time=1148] But today once again he has shown me this quality in his life that really causes me to consider what God wants me to be.
[time=1157] And that is that each time I've been around him in private he has been very interested in me and us in the kingdom of God.
[time=1167] Rather than touting what his last great responsibility has been or where he's been in the world, he's been interested in me.
[time=1175] And that's happened every time.
[time=1177] I believe God has used a great humble man to further his kingdom.
[time=1183] And now we have the privilege of having him come in full our pulpit this morning.
[time=1187] Let's welcome Dr. Jay Kessler as he comes.
[time=1190] (audience applauds)
[time=1196] - Thank you, Pastor, for that very kind introduction.
[time=1199] I am very glad to be here today.
[time=1202] We came up from upland in the hinterlands of Indiana.
[time=1207] It's not the end of the world, but you can see it from there if you get right at the edge.
[time=1212] And as we came around the bypass, all of Indiana was covered with clouds and snow this morning.
[time=1221] I mean, it was really bad up to Huntington, I think.
[time=1224] And then there was just this one open spot with the sun shining through over Black Hawk Church.
[time=1230] And that must be some kind of a sign this morning.
[time=1233] And so we're just glad to be here on such a morning as this, a beautiful winter morning.
[time=1238] You know, when you're called on to be the visiting fireman, hoping that Pastor is having a good relaxation and a good ministry, you kind of wonder sometimes what should we talk about and so on and pray about that and try to get some leading from the Lord.
[time=1253] And I've done that really.
[time=1254] I just really didn't want to kind of reach in the old barrel and pull out, you know, one of those dying pickles.
[time=1262] And wanted to bring something to you that's kind of at the cutting edge of where I am right this moment, what the Lord is speaking to me.
[time=1272] And I felt led to speak to you from Matthew the 24th chapter.
[time=1277] If you have your Bibles, open them to Matthew 24 and keep your finger in there 'cause we are going to spend quite a bit of time in these two chapters, Matthew 24 and 25 this morning.
[time=1288] And trust the Lord will make this a useful and worthwhile time for all of us.
[time=1292] I'm going to read just a short passage of scripture.
[time=1296] There will be covering quite a lot of territory here.
[time=1299] Matthew 24, the first three verses.
[time=1302] If you have your Bible, I'm reading from the NIV here.
[time=1305] Some of you in the back may want to use your amplified so you can hear a little better.
[time=1309] But I'll be here in Matthew 24, that's good.
[time=1314] I'm just checking to see if you're awake here.
[time=1316] This one, we got a couple of Presbyterians down here in front of former Presbyterians and they gotta always watch them, you know.
[time=1322] Okay, Matthew 24, Jesus left the temple
[time=1328] and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.
[time=1334] Do you see all these things he asked?
[time=1336] I tell you the truth, not one stone here will be left on another.
[time=1340] Everyone will be thrown down.
[time=1342] As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately.
[time=1346] Tell us, they said, when will this happen and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?
[time=1354] Before we discuss that, let's just pray.
[time=1356] Father, we thank you that we can be in this place called Blackhawk Baptist.
[time=1361] Greatful Lord for this fellowship that gathers here week after week.
[time=1365] Greatful Lord that we can be part of the family of God and the body of Christ in a local setting where we can gather together, hear your word preached, bear with another's burdens, thus fulfill a law of Christ and be equipped to go out into the world and make a difference in a needy place.
[time=1384] We pray Lord that this Sunday we'll work to that end.
[time=1386] We're encouraging your word not to forsake the summers of ourselves together.
[time=1390] We try not to do that.
[time=1392] We need this really.
[time=1394] We spend all week getting just a little bit crooked and we need to come back and get straightened out and to get back on plum and get heading the direction you want us to go.
[time=1403] And so Lord, we thank you for this opportunity.
[time=1404] I thank you for the choir.
[time=1406] I thank you for this beautiful, beautiful song, Michelle's song.
[time=1411] I thank you Lord for the bells, for the whole experience of worship together with brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=1417] I pray Lord, the words I share may contribute to what you want to achieve today.
[time=1421] By the time we've left, maybe be more the kind of people you had in mind when you first created us.
[time=1427] We just give ourselves to you for that end.
[time=1429] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=1431] As I mentioned, the three verses that I've read prompt a rather great interest in all of us
[time=1442] and certainly did in the disciples.
[time=1444] The setting is not unlike me coming from upland today.
[time=1448] The disciples came from Galilee.
[time=1451] They were country fellows and had come with Jesus really to the big city, to Jerusalem.
[time=1457] They were there at the Temple Mount and saw the largest buildings really in that part of the known world.
[time=1464] And they were just awestruck by it.
[time=1466] It's not unlike we would be when we visit New York or something like that.
[time=1469] And they're gazing at the buildings and seeing all the magnificence of it all.
[time=1473] And as they're doing this, Jesus makes a comment to them.
[time=1476] He says, not one stone here, not one block or brick you see here will remain on top of each other.
[time=1483] They will all someday fall down and be done away with.
[time=1488] Well, this was the course greatest achievement of their civilization that worked on their minds a little bit and so a little later, he was sitting with them on the Mount of Olives and they said, tell us, when will this happen?
[time=1502] And what will be the sign of your coming, the end of the age?
[time=1505] And then Jesus gave them the rest of Matthew 24 and Matthew 25 as his response to that particular question.
[time=1515] Now it seems to me there's an awful lot of interest right now in this same question, the end of the age and so on.
[time=1521] I'm getting just numbers of mailings, fundraising letters and opportunities to help folks and so on that have in them kind of predictions about the end of the age.
[time=1532] People are reminding me of the rising crime rate, drugs, illegitimacy, problems with currency, alignments of nations, famines, earthquakes, whatever.
[time=1545] It's just amazing how much bad news there seems to be out there and then how many people seem to tie it to these kinds of words that are in the New Testament.
[time=1557] I have a particularly good and fond friend in California who is on the inside to some degree.
[time=1565] He's very highly placed in the military.
[time=1568] He has collected a lot of information over the years and he knows for instance how many American troops are here and there and how many tons of TNT and how many missiles and what country has this and what country has that and why we should be concerned about the North Koreans and why we shouldn't be concerned about somebody else and he's just full of this kind of information.
[time=1588] And every once in a while he sends me a mailing in fact he's kind of in a right now in kind of an urge.
[time=1594] I think he sent me enough that it would take me a month to get through it.
[time=1597] But yesterday or day before I got a bundle and then it was a tape and a videotape of some television program about the end times, some television preacher who had put it together and organized it for him.
[time=1610] And then he has some Xerox pages from some book on prophecy and then he has a Xerox page of Los Angeles times with a map on it and there's a circle of the epicenter of the recent earthquake and a tracing of the St. Andreas fault and a place where his house is.
[time=1630] His house happens to be right on the fault and this probably prompts some of his writing I presume although he's a good Indiana boy he could move home.
[time=1640] But be it as it may, he ties the whole thing to the end times and he's wanting to get my opinion.
[time=1647] He's also wanting to warn me that gosh, ain't it awful, things are about to collapse and we better get ready and somebody better do something about it.
[time=1656] And I think he expects me to do something about it which I have no idea what to do about it except that I find a great many people are on this particular wavelength today.
[time=1666] And I would say this about it.
[time=1668] I know when I was a boy, for instance, maybe you did this.
[time=1671] I would occasionally get in a period of my life and I get real fascinated with this kind of stuff.
[time=1676] I once read a book called "In the Twinkling of an Eye" and I remember that in airplanes or pilot lists and trucks are running into others and buses are living their driver and this has been done numbers of time in movies and whatever.
[time=1690] I used to go to Winona Lake, maybe remember Winona Lake when they had the Billy Sunday tabernacle there, one great big room full of sawdust and mosquitoes as I remember.
[time=1699] And we would go to Winona and they would bring in prophecy conventions and they'd have fellows there and often if they spoke with a German accent it was more impressive but they would have great pieces of oil cloth in those days.
[time=1713] That was before the overhead and that kind of dates me.
[time=1716] Fred Flintstone, myself, others used to go to Winona.
[time=1718] And they would have these big oil cloth things with the timeline, the beginning of creation and a line and there'd be arrows going here and there and doves flying up and down and fires and explosions and whatever along the way.
[time=1732] And you'd kind of try to find yourself on there and figure boy and I always used to worry am I going to have a birthday, will they do it before my birthday party or will we have Christmas or will I get married or those were my concerns?
[time=1747] Well I'm not saying that I've become calloused or inoculated by all this but time does something for you as you've experienced this.
[time=1758] Many people say because we're entering into a new millennium we can expect a lot more of this kind of talk, a lot more of these tapes, a lot more of this preaching and so on, what to do or what about it?
[time=1771] Well behind it all, I guess I come to this conclusion, I am much more concerned about what God says about it than somebody who's trying to raise funds to the mail.
[time=1780] I am much more concerned about what Jesus thought about it than I am about the most informed television preacher though many of them are people I respect very, very greatly.
[time=1791] One thing I do know, the Lord's return is a day closer than it was yesterday and 40 years closer than those days back at one on the lake and all of that, that I know and there are many days when I find myself in the midst of my particular set of struggles when I just want to kind of throw up my hands and say even so come Lord Jesus, that is I kind of feel like I don't see any way out of this.
[time=1814] You know I've been the last few weeks like you've been neutered and all this and I listen to people on television I say boy it is bad, isn't it?
[time=1823] And what are we gonna do?
[time=1826] Well the apostles felt that way and they said to Jesus, tell us something.
[time=1831] Well in the next few paragraphs he gave the world phrases that though maybe you haven't spent a lot of time studying this passage, they are part of our vocabulary, part of literature, I think there's been a movie or a book produced about every phrase in the 24th chapter of Matthew.
[time=1850] He says watch out, no one deceive you, many will come in my name, claiming I am Christ and will deceive many, you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars, the seat to it that you're not alarmed, such things must happen, nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, there'll be famines and earthquakes in various places, all these are beginning of the birth pains and on it goes false prophets, pregnant women, nursing mothers, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
[time=1884] Jesus predicts cosmic events and these can't even be reproduced by cinematographers, I mean this is big time prediction and all of it will happen sometime in human history, Jesus said.
[time=1900] However, he went on to say, be careful about this in verse 36, no one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the son, but only the father.
[time=1919] And so I have kind of as a guiding principle when I'm living in this kind of times to be kind of careful of people who build retreats in Waco, Texas or people who want to tell me join their things, send the money, get back their plaque or whatever, I know that if they're setting times and telling me things that even the angels don't know or things that Jesus doesn't know, then they're a little suspect for me.
[time=1949] I mean, somehow or another in my theology, I put Jesus on a little higher plane than even the most impressive of these people, blow dryer or not.
[time=1959] The son does not know certain things, the time or the hour, but he does say, we can be sure that these things are gonna happen.
[time=1969] He says, two will be in a field, one taken and the other left behind.
[time=1976] Two women will be working in a mill, one will be taken, the other will be left behind.
[time=1982] And he gave us phrases in this passage that are part of our consciousness, part of literature, the thief in the night, those kinds of things.
[time=1992] And so I'm not in any way detracting from the idea of God guiding cosmic events
[time=2003] and someday bringing an end to the age.
[time=2005] There will be a day when God will say, strike the set.
[time=2009] He made it and he'll do it in.
[time=2011] But what I'm speaking to is what to do.
[time=2015] What do we do in the meantime?
[time=2018] What's our activity?
[time=2019] And I'm so grateful that Jesus did not leave us uninstructed.
[time=2024] We have in the 25th chapter of Matthew three parables, put there for the express purpose of instructing us about our behavior in the meantime.
[time=2038] In other words, these are parables of the interim between the time that we live, the generation, and that's a whole epoch in the Bible between the time of Jesus coming and his second coming, what to do parables of the interim?
[time=2055] Well, the first one is called the parable of the 10 virgins with which we're all very familiar.
[time=2061] It talks about 10 virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
[time=2065] Five of them were foolish and five were wise.
[time=2069] The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them.
[time=2072] The wise, however, took oil and jars along with their lamps.
[time=2076] The bridegroom was a long way at time incoming and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
[time=2081] At midnight, the cry rang out, here's the bridegroom, come out to meet him.
[time=2085] The foolish ones said to the wise, give us some of your oil, our lamps are going out, no, they replied, there not be enough and so on.
[time=2092] It's clearly a parable about preparedness.
[time=2097] The point of the parable is be prepared.
[time=2102] Now, what does this mean?
[time=2105] Charles Wesley is said to have been asked while he was hoeing in his garden, what would you do if you knew the Lord was gonna come this evening?
[time=2114] And he said, I would finish this role because Charles Wesley understood the importance of not getting caught up in this sort of activity but being prepared, being ready.
[time=2131] This week, I've had two friends die.
[time=2133] Both of them in their fifties.
[time=2138] And believe me, when people die before their fiftieth birthday, that's scary to me.
[time=2141] I start every day reading the front page and I go immediately to the bituary.
[time=2146] I go there before the sports page these days.
[time=2149] And I really am interested in only one thing, the number behind their name.
[time=2153] And I'm finding that most of them are dying before they get to the age I am and that scares me but these two fellows were fellows who I have to say, I sort of, well, I was jealous of them, frankly.
[time=2167] Both of them are wheat and grads.
[time=2169] Both of them very, very bright.
[time=2171] I was given by God this body.
[time=2173] A lot of times when I look in the mirror at myself, I feel like I must have been made by a committee just before quitting time.
[time=2179] They kind of said, oh, they got a basket full of parts, toss them in there.
[time=2184] I kind of feel like a dumpy middle-aged person.
[time=2187] I used to have a crew cut, my crew bailed out.
[time=2189] I'm sort of struggling with, you know, but here are these guys, six, two, 195 pounds, bronze bodies.
[time=2200] When they were in college, you used to carry a stick around just to beat the girls off.
[time=2202] Get away, get away, get away.
[time=2204] And they could do things that I always wanted to do.
[time=2206] Both of them played full back, could run over other people with a football.
[time=2210] That was my idea of if I just won one thing from God, it would be to run over people with a football in my hands and both of them could do it.
[time=2218] Both of them this week died of what they called massive strokes, just boom.
[time=2225] So I've been taking my little aspirin a day and trying to be prepared, but the truth of the matter is, no one knows the time of the hour.
[time=2233] So Jesus said, regardless of when these cosmic events take place, be prepared.
[time=2238] No one knows.
[time=2240] Folks come to Blackhawk.
[time=2245] And I look at this congregation.
[time=2248] It's kind of a good thing to be in my position today because I do not know who is a prayer request here.
[time=2254] I talked to a kid one day over at Grace College and he said, "You know who I am?" I said, "What are you?" He said, "I'm a silent prayer request." They always say, "Any prayer requests?" And they always hold their hand and look at me.
[time=2264] Well, I don't know if you're a prayer request here or not.
[time=2268] But I do know this, that the gospel has been preached faithfully, Sunday after Sunday at Blackhawk Church, ever since there's been a Blackhawk Church.
[time=2276] And if you are here and have considered
[time=2282] and gone away like the kings in the New Testament saying, "Paul, I want to think about this a little longer," or, "I'm not sure I want to do this." I would encourage you that when you do get that great flashing pain through your head or you clutch your chest, it would be a good idea to have prepared before then.
[time=2304] You may not have a lot of time to do theology 101 while you're gasping for that last breath.
[time=2312] Be prepared.
[time=2313] Be prepared as far as the quality of our life.
[time=2318] Maybe, you know, there's only two kinds of Christians I ever met.
[time=2322] Those living as close to sin as they can get and those trying to live as close to God as they can get.
[time=2329] And then they want to sit, you know what?
[time=2332] Taylor, freshmen come and they always spend the first two years sitting in the dormitory doing theoretical arguments.
[time=2340] You know, the Baptist kids with the Methodist kids and the Presbyterian kids with this image of God's kids and talking about eternal security and all that.
[time=2347] And then about sophomore year, they kind of get worn out on it and decide, well, we're all kind of Chaminians anyway.
[time=2354] And of course, that's the kind of place this is anyway.
[time=2357] I don't think you are, but you are.
[time=2360] Theory about theology is not nearly so important as living faithfully and being what God wants us
[time=2373] to be day by day and being prepared.
[time=2375] I had a person call me this last week who's writing a book about fathers.
[time=2381] He said, "J, your dad's dead, isn't he?" And I said, "Yes." He said, "I'm doing a book about fathers and I just wanted a couple few paragraphs from you about your feelings about the death of your father.
[time=2392] What would you say?" And I said, "Well, let me have the night and I'll call you back tomorrow." So I called him the next day and I said to him and thinking about it.
[time=2403] The thing I'm most grateful about is when my dad died, we had no unfinished business.
[time=2410] I have no conversation I wanted to have with him in which I said, "Dad, forgive me for saying this," or, "Dad, I can't get across this little barrier between the two of us," or whatever.
[time=2423] My dad and I, when he died, were on best of loving terms.
[time=2428] When I got the phone call in the middle of the night from my brother-in-law, my brother-in-law had been breathing into my dad's lungs, trying to bring him back and couldn't do it.
[time=2439] He was weeping and saying, "J, I tried as much as I could.
[time=2441] I tried as much as I could." I said to him, "Don, relax." Dad is ready to meet the Lord.
[time=2448] He's a Christian.
[time=2450] He's with the Lord.
[time=2452] And hey, we got nothing else to say.
[time=2455] Now I got lots of stuff we're gonna do in heaven.
[time=2458] I mean, I don't know what the place is like.
[time=2460] I'm quite sure it has nothing to do with night shirts and harps.
[time=2465] I don't like either of them now and I don't want an eternity full of them.
[time=2470] And there's no place in the Bible that tells me that, but there are some things I like.
[time=2474] I like fishing, I found out Steve does too.
[time=2476] Whatever it is that God's God in heaven, better than fishing, I wanna get there.
[time=2481] I want that.
[time=2483] 'Cause there, everything's different.
[time=2485] Here, spend your lifetime getting gold, they're gonna use it for asphalt, to make streets out of it.
[time=2490] Here, people would dive at the bottom of the ocean and get pearls, they're gonna use it for pig iron and make gates out of it.
[time=2497] So fishing, it must be a counterpart.
[time=2500] So Dad and I are gonna do that, we get there.
[time=2503] But he was prepared, be prepared.
[time=2507] Are you prepared to meet the Lord?
[time=2509] Do you have an agenda, you haven't finished?
[time=2512] You got some stuff you're gonna straighten out, a habit you're gonna overcome, a compulsion you're gonna work on.
[time=2518] A hatred that you're nursing.
[time=2525] Is there someone you ought to call and say let's have it over with?
[time=2528] It's enough, forgive me.
[time=2530] Let's stop, let's stop, we don't have time for this.
[time=2534] Perable of the interim, be prepared.
[time=2537] The second one is commonly called the Perable of the Talents.
[time=2541] It will be like a man in the 14th verse, 25, on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them.
[time=2549] 20 gave five talents of money to another two talents and to another one talent, each according to his ability.
[time=2555] Remember the story.
[time=2560] If we could easily conclude that the title of the virgins is be prepared, you wouldn't spend long in this parable without concluding it says be productive.
[time=2571] Be productive.
[time=2573] Don't just sit on your hands between now and the time the Lord returns.
[time=2577] Don't just wait for the return, get about your father's business.
[time=2582] I pulled into a filling station, not too far from here and handed my credit card.
[time=2587] The young man put it through the thing, however they do, I don't know what she was.
[time=2591] And he said, "Oh, you're Jay Kessler, aren't you?" And I said, "Yes." He said, "Oh, glad to meet you." She shook my hand, whatever, heard radio or something.
[time=2599] And I said, "Well, tell me about yourself.
[time=2601] "You look like a college age kid, 22 years old." He said, "Yeah, I used to, "I didn't go to college, I only went a semester." Well, I said, "Well, why would you drop out of your work?" And I tried to encourage you because I crammed my four years into six.
[time=2619] Working at jobs and going home for a semester and roofing houses and whatever.
[time=2623] And I just wanted to encourage the kid about it.
[time=2625] And he said, "No, no, you know, "the Lord's gonna return very soon." He had a whole stack of tracks on the top of his filling station thing.
[time=2634] And he gave me one of them about the Lord's return in a day or two.
[time=2637] I said, "Are you aware that the Apostle Paul "believed in the imminent return of the Lord Jesus?" And he said, "What's imminent?" And I said, "Well, this means Paul thought "the Lord was coming in his lifetime "or most scholars think Paul did, but Paul was wrong." And Jesus was right.
[time=2655] We don't know the time or the hour.
[time=2657] And here's this young man who dropped out of college because he said, "I don't want to spend my money, "waste my time, spend my money going to college "because the Lord's gonna come back." Now, that story is probably four years old.
[time=2667] He could have been out by now.
[time=2669] This church, I came down south on the road there
[time=2675] and Jenny said, "What's that?" And I said, "That's the church at the end of the road." She hadn't been here since the new building had been, but it looks kind of like one of the pyramids.
[time=2685] It's a huge thing.
[time=2686] It's a huge thing at the end of the road here.
[time=2689] Why isn't it made out of corrugated tin and sticks?
[time=2692] Why isn't it a tent?
[time=2694] It's a bunch of backslidden people here at Black Hawk.
[time=2700] Don't they know the importance of the Lord's return?
[time=2703] What is this?
[time=2703] It looks to me like you've got that long-wear carpet.
[time=2706] It should have got the cheap stuff.
[time=2707] No, it's guided by a theology.
[time=2711] They'll even so come, Lord Jesus, we're happy to have him come today or tomorrow, but our deep suspicion is that he's holding off a while.
[time=2722] And in the meantime, we should be productive.
[time=2724] This church should be running full throttle, preparing people to go out into the highways and hedge.
[time=2729] People say, "Well, tell me about Black Hawk church." Let me tell you, Black Hawk church is not a bunch of bricks.
[time=2736] Black Hawk church is a group of people who go out into the world at every level to try to be productive for Jesus Christ every day.
[time=2743] That's what it's all about.
[time=2745] What happens in this sanctuary?
[time=2747] This is just like fueling the car.
[time=2749] I mean, it's like, how do you like your car?
[time=2751] Oh, I fill it with gas all the time.
[time=2753] It just sits in a gas tank in the garage.
[time=2755] We fill it with gas.
[time=2757] Well, you like to do something with a car other than fill it with gas, right?
[time=2760] You do something with Black Hawk, rather than just fill it with gas.
[time=2764] People go out in our productive.
[time=2766] People say to me, "Well, what do you think about the church today versus the church when you were a boy?" Well, I think the church today is a lot better myself.
[time=2774] I mean, I think what makes the good old days, the good old days, by and large, is a poor memory.
[time=2778] But I remember growing up in a church where we came and sat every week to have a pastor preach at us.
[time=2785] And we saw the church like a Boy Scout troop.
[time=2788] The Eagle Scouts were going to the mission field.
[time=2790] The life scouts were going to be pastors.
[time=2794] The star scouts were going to go into Christian Ed or something, and then the real tender feet, the real backsliders and all, they went into business and stuff like that.
[time=2801] Just kind of the dross, the leftovers went there.
[time=2805] Now we know that's not the way it is at all.
[time=2808] It's bloom where you're planted.
[time=2810] Yes, he calls people to be missionaries and pastors, but he calls people to be carpenters and plumbers and homemakers and schoolteachers and all kinds of things.
[time=2820] Be productive where you are, bloom where you're planted is the point.
[time=2824] Don't sit around having religious ecstasy until the Lord returns.
[time=2827] Don't buy a white robe and go to Waco.
[time=2830] Be productive.
[time=2833] One man had talents and he just buried them.
[time=2837] Was afraid of the marketplace.
[time=2839] Have a friend used to be chairman of our Board of Youth for Christ.
[time=2844] He said, "Never trust a man that's never gone broke." And he was really trying to say by that, in order to accomplish much big, you have to take some risk once in a while.
[time=2854] We need to be risk-takers for Christ and try to accomplish things and get things done for the Lord.
[time=2860] I won't tell that story, I'll move on.
[time=2864] Third parable, the parable of the 10 virgins be prepared.
[time=2871] The parable of the talents be productive.
[time=2874] The parable of the sheep and the goats and the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, he'll sit on his throne in heavenly glory.
[time=2881] All the nations will be gathered before him and he'll separate the people one from the others, the shepherd shepherds, separates the sheep from the goats.
[time=2888] Sheep on the right hand, goats on the left.
[time=2890] They will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or stranger and eating clothes or sick or in prison and not help you?
[time=2899] He'll say, "Tell you the truth, as much as you did not do it to the least of these, my brethren, you did not do it for me." This parable is about practical, down the earth, tire meets the road, Christianity.
[time=2914] Be doing the little stuff before you think about the big stuff.
[time=2919] Do the little stuff and the big stuff will take care of itself.
[time=2921] Don't wait around for big religious opportunities.
[time=2924] My son called me yesterday morning.
[time=2929] He lives in South Bend.
[time=2931] About six months ago, he started calling me every Saturday morning and I think he must have been in a church or something where he said, "You keep in touch with your dad or your old dad's going to go toes up one of these days.
[time=2941] You'll wish you'd talk to him," whatever it is.
[time=2943] So he's starting to call me once a week.
[time=2946] And I'm really grateful that he's done this and yesterday morning I was actually sitting in my study waiting for the phone to ring.
[time=2952] When it rang, I sprung across the room, grabbed the phone, "Hello," and I knew it was Bruce.
[time=2957] We talked about his family and his work.
[time=2960] And he starts talking about his life.
[time=2963] He runs a camp for inner-city children.
[time=2966] They're between fourth graders and ninth graders.
[time=2970] Not a one of them will ever buy a church bond, all minority kids, broken homes, single-parent families, terrible situations.
[time=2980] He said, "Dad, I've been thinking a lot about this.
[time=2985] I'm not going to change the whole world."
[time=2991] He said, "But I wanted to ask you a favor.
[time=2994] He said, "There's this young man we've been working with at the camp for several years.
[time=2999] We've had him for five or six years, and he's a senior in high school, and I'd like to see him go to Taylor." And he said, "If you weren't president, someone else was president, I'd write to him and try to pull some strings, but because you're president, I don't know what to do." And I said, "Well, we don't want to be like the coach.
[time=3018] You won't let his own kid play." I said, "Write me, tell me about him, and I'll treat it like you're a stranger." He'll write.
[time=3024] And he said, "Well, Dad, the point is, I guess maybe if I could affect in my life 20 young men like this, it would be worth it all, huh?" And I said, "Yeah, Bruce, that's really the whole secret.
[time=3043] That's where the Bible's built." Thank the Lord for Billy Graham.
[time=3051] Thank the Lord for the people who accomplished big things, but most of it's done by just ordinary people passing cups of water.
[time=3058] It's a cup of water here, it's a word there.
[time=3062] It's to be friending here.
[time=3063] It's an extra mile there.
[time=3066] It's a word for Christ.
[time=3069] It's a sitting with a man at work and saying, "John, we've been working together for 15 years." And you, I know, think I'm kind of a religious person.
[time=3078] You know I go to Blackhawk.
[time=3080] And it may be curious to you, but just here while we're quietly drinking, I'll buy today if you'll just listen to me.
[time=3086] I just, for 15 years, I want you to know, I've enjoyed knowing you, I've enjoyed working with you, but I haven't shared with you the most important thing about my life.
[time=3095] And that is that my life was turned around, absolutely revolutionized, made new by Jesus Christ.
[time=3103] I'm not a religious nut.
[time=3104] Don't put me in some category with something called a religious right.
[time=3107] Don't let the media people fool you.
[time=3109] I'm just a guy like you, but I know Jesus Christ is my savior and it's the most important thing to me.
[time=3116] And my desperate desire is to try to have you understand that and come to Christ yourself.
[time=3121] Give that person that cup of cold water.
[time=3125] Be involved in practical works of Christian charity.
[time=3134] When I told Janie I was going to try to do this today, I said to her, honey, I get the feeling that something's out there in the air.
[time=3142] I'm getting so many mailings.
[time=3146] I am listening to so many television sermons and radio sermons, I'm seeing so many books that sound to me like people feel like the apostles did when they thought this whole thing's going to come collapsing down when, Lord, and tell me about it.
[time=3163] And Jesus said, well, it's going to be some cataclysmic event, believe me.
[time=3167] The moon will lose its light, the stars will fall,
[time=3174] to be in the field, one taken, the other left behind.
[time=3177] Tornadoes, earthquakes, famine, pestilence, sword,
[time=3183] nation against nation, but I don't know when it's going to happen.
[time=3191] God didn't tell me or the angels, only he knows.
[time=3195] But you guys, let me tell you three little stories.
[time=3199] Story of 10 virgins, story of the talents,
[time=3207] the story of the sheep and the goats, be prepared.
[time=3210] Be productive and be involved in daily work of Christian charity, moment by moment by moment, doing what God have you do.
[time=3220] Do you feel some days like even so come, Lord Jesus?
[time=3222] You and I struggle with most the fact that God may not signify himself by coming in my lifetime.
[time=3232] You ever get the feeling that God's going to really be significant, he's got to do this in our lifetime.
[time=3239] Well, the truth of the matter is my lifetime may be a blip on the screen of history.
[time=3244] My grandchildren may have great grandchildren and the television preachers will still be drawing those pictures and they'll be right.
[time=3251] The only thing a little bit wrong about is the timeline 'cause they don't know and the angels don't know and Jesus doesn't know or didn't know then, I think he knows now, but only the Father knows.
[time=3264] I pray that God would make this church, not the kind of a church that get caught up in every kind of little alarmist talk that comes along, that this won't be a church that somehow has to by its own ego to be in on the know, be able to tell people that no one else knows, little repository of special religious truth in Fort Wayne, but I pray this church would be a place where God's people live the Christian life in such a convincing manner that people all over the city say tell us about this Jesus Christ and what he's done for your life and let's wait together for his coming, amen, amen.
[time=3299] Father in heaven, I thank you for this church, for its history, for the chapters in its history, for its growth to this point of far greater influence
[time=3314] than most of these people know in this community.
[time=3316] I pray to your God that you'd help us to be confident
[time=3322] and anxious for your coming.
[time=3327] Yes, even so come Lord Jesus.
[time=3331] You, things do look pretty bleak and in our humanity, we can't push the vectors much farther they cross out there very quickly and we feel like we're living in the end times, but if you choose to put it off for our great, great, great grandchildren, do it Lord.
[time=3351] If you choose to come before I finish this sentence, amen.
[time=3355] But Lord, may we never forget the words of Jesus.
[time=3359] Be prepared, be productive, and be about my father's business.
[time=3365] May this be true and be our lives.
[time=3368] We pray in Jesus' name and for his sake, amen.
[time=3371] (gentle music)
[time=3390] (gentle music) - Well, that's a great message by Dr. J. Kessler and how thankful we are for his strong and true testimony through the years to one very simple thing, the redeeming love of God through Jesus Christ.
[time=3406] J has spoken about that this morning and you have an opportunity to respond to that in a very personal way.
[time=3415] In a moment here, I'm gonna lead you in a prayer and if you wanna have the love of God come into your life through the person of Jesus Christ to be changed, to know the transforming power of God through the forgiveness of Christ.
[time=3426] I invite you to bow your head with me here and as I say this prayer out loud, I invite you to say it in your heart to yourself or even out loud to God.
[time=3434] Either way, he'll hear you just so long as you mean it.
[time=3437] Let's pray together.
[time=3438] Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3442] I know that I don't deserve your mercy and your grace and your forgiveness.
[time=3448] But I understand that you offer it to me as a free gift in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3452] And I wanna accept that gift.
[time=3455] I accept Christ into my heart and into my life to be my Lord and my Savior.
[time=3460] And with that, to know that I'll be with you forgiven forever and ever in heaven.
[time=3465] Thank you for saving me today in Jesus Christ, amen.
[time=3469] Well, if you just prayed that prayer, we'd love to hear from you here at the Bible Hour.
