[time=0] Reconciliation means going from being in a hostile adversarial relationship with God.
[time=7] Your relationship is hostile towards Him, and His is hostile towards you.
[time=12] Goes from that to being at peace and having friendship with God.
[time=22] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=27] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=28] Have you ever been in such a terrible altercation with someone that it seemed beyond repair?
[time=34] Oh, you may make apologies and say you're sorry and offer forgiveness, but the hurt has gone too deep.
[time=41] The memory refuses to let go, and there's no hope for reconciliation.
[time=47] Well today in our study of Colossians, we'll gain a new sense of appreciation for God's ability to be reconciled to sinful people like you and me.
[time=56] Now let's join our service.
[time=58] As the sanctuary choir and David's statements sing, "Come, let us celebrate."
[time=86] [MUSIC]
[time=103] We'll go down by the awful rain of sin, dying with no hope of healing within.
[time=119] Then there came the precious man who brought us God's salvation plan.
[time=127] He broke the chains, death and hell, and gave us life and made us well.
[time=137] Celebrate, celebrate, and freedom.
[time=154] Now reconcile to the Father through Jesus the Son.
[time=180] Lead it together with Him, the glorified One.
[time=189] Now we are His worship, created in Christ's dream, made it by choice.
[time=197] The kings and kings and kings, the kings and kings, the kings and kings.
[time=213] We need to Jesus, who brought us from darkness, who brought us from darkness into His marvelous
[time=228] dream, His marvellous light.
[time=244] Rejoice in the air, Who reigns forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.
[time=257] Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.
[time=296] We'll return to more of the Bible hour in a moment, but here's a question for you.
[time=313] Do you have problems that seem to be too great to bear?
[time=316] Perhaps you wonder if there's any way out of the mess you're in.
[time=319] Well, right now the Bible hour is offering free to all who write this booklet written by Jay Adams, called Christ and Your Problems.
[time=326] Jay offers real hope.
[time=328] You'll gain courage to take responsible action, knowing that there's real solutions found in God's Word.
[time=334] Stay tuned, I'll give you our address at the end of the program.
[time=337] Hi, welcome to the Bible hour.
[time=339] My name is Russell Moore and I'm thankful you joined us today and we're looking forward to spending this time with you and encouraging you and the things of God.
[time=346] We're sitting around the family table the other day talking about a dear friend of ours who has recently been diagnosed with cancer and we were going to pray that God would give
[time=356] them strength and encouragement and my little five-year-old said no, let's pray that God
[time=363] will heal her and we assured our little five-year-old that God would be happy to hear that prayer
[time=370] and he certainly has the power to heal her if he wants to but there's no guarantee of that.
[time=375] She said to us and she says, but we're praying to Jesus and Jesus can do anything and what
[time=381] a refreshing thought that was and how it did encourage us.
[time=385] Of course it is still true that Jesus Christ can do anything.
[time=388] He can heal a disease although he has not obligated to do that and we ended up kind of praying for both, that if the Lord would will he would heal this person of her cancer at the same time, strengthen and encourage them as they go through a hard time.
[time=402] And I say that to say this, I don't know what difficult situation you're in or how hard it may be but we at the Bible are would love to pray for you, write us with your requests and we take time each week and pray for you as you send in your requests and we'd be happy to pray specifically for you by name.
[time=418] I want to let you know that coming up here the last Sunday of February we're having an outreach service.
[time=423] It's during our normal Sunday morning program at 910 or 1050 but it'll be a completely different
[time=429] format of service, it's designed to reach the unsaved and if you don't have a church home, if you're unfamiliar with church, if you'd like to experiment with a church but you know you don't want a traditional kind of format, you'd like to see a different way to do church.
[time=443] We invite you to come absolutely free of charge of course and you can come on your own, we welcome you, we think you'll find it a very different kind of service, one that we hope will connect with you relevantly and clearly communicate to you the way in which God would love to minister to you and encourage you and strengthen you and equip you for a wonderful God honoring life.
[time=463] We'd love for you to be with us.
[time=487] Despising all the shame that afternoon when midnight fell, your suffering cleared my name
[time=507] and that sin swept ill became the open door to paradise because you paid so high a price
[time=535] you paid much to high a price for me, your tinge of love you paid, to have my soul
[time=555] stirred at times yet never truly changed, you deserve a fiery love that won't ignore
[time=572] your sacrifice cause you paid much to high a price
[time=600] inspires my heart to rise above the sin, while all the earthly vanities that seek to draw
[time=621] me in I want to tell this jaded world about a love that saved my life, a love that paid
[time=645] so high a price you paid much to high a price for me, your tinge of love, no pain to have
[time=671] my soul stirred at times yet never truly changed, you deserve a fiery love that won't ignore
[time=692] your sacrifice because you paid much to high a price
[time=716] you deserve a fiery love that won't ignore your sacrifice
[time=732] cause you paid much to high a price
[time=762] well let me invite you this morning to come with me to Colossians chapter 1, excited
[time=774] about a return opportunity to return to our study of this wonderful book and if you're new to our church or visiting this morning it is our practice in what we call our worship
[time=785] services to study God's Word and try to learn from God what He would say to us in our day
[time=791] and age we're studying the book of Colossians which was written several thousand years ago to some people who lived in a city called Colossi in Asia Minor but what the Lord taught
[time=802] them seems very relevant to us and so we'll study this book chapter by chapter paragraph
[time=809] by paragraph in an effort to understand what God has said to them and how it applies to us we're in Colossians chapter 1 verses 20 to 23 and you'll notice the word reconciliation
[time=822] appears two times in this wonderful paragraph once in verse 20 through him to reconcile
[time=828] all things to himself and then again in verse 22 you'll see the word again yet he has now
[time=834] reconciled you in his fleshly body through death this passage is about the wonder of
[time=841] reconciliation and it is in fact a very technical term we studied in seminary I could go on and
[time=847] on and on but when I see the word reconciliation I don't think of my seminary notes or my classroom or my professors I think of a teenage girl in the streets of New York City my wife and
[time=860] I were looking for a place to have a meal with a pastor friend Andy and Valerie Zovanovitch it was 2 a.m. we have been in New York City I had for about three weeks and it was my responsibility to organize and keep safe and kind of mobilize nearly three four hundred
[time=876] high school students and college students all around the city of New York as the city was flooded with people coming to see the renovation of the Statue of Liberty and the reopening of her with the celebrations that went with it and it had been a long long
[time=890] couple three weeks I personally don't like administration very much I'm not very good at it I got stuck with the job I was trying to do my best where do you feed him where do you sleep him how do you transport him what do you do when they get lost what do you do when they get mugged what do you do when they lose their money you know how do you get them to share their faith where do they share their faith how do you it was like oh it was just this this nightmare of stuff as far as I was concerned happy to do it however because I wanted the gospel to go out we came near the end of my three week stand and Heidi was able to join us for the last couple of days of it and there was a kind of a big celebration all the kids and all the staff we got on this boat and went out into the harbor and went around the Statue of Liberty and the fireworks were going crazy and we were kind of rejoicing and all that had happened we got off the boat and the transportation took the kids away and we kind of said hey let's just walk through the city a little bit find a place to eat and catch it catch a cab back to where our accommodations were we didn't know it but we ended up walking through the red light district of New York City that in and of itself was an experience and came just to the edge of that and saw a little cafe a little diner across the street and thought we'd have a meal there as we were waiting for the light to change across the street we heard across the other street some really harsh tones some demeaning
[time=963] tones and we looked over and there was this little girl a thirteen fourteen year old teenage girl a prostitute on the streets of New York City who was being accosted by three young men we couldn't hear or make out the specifics but we could tell it was not a good conversation she finally bolted away from them and ran down the street and kind of hid in the doorway
[time=985] and Heidi and Valerie went across that part of the street and approached her and invited
[time=991] her to come and have a meal with us and it was as if we'd been working on all the administration of sharing the gospel with thousands of people through hundreds of students and before the thing that was over the Lord was going to give us a face to face personal encounter of our own and so we were in this restaurant and Andy and I could not sit at the same table
[time=1011] with her because she wouldn't allow it and so Heidi and Valerie were sharing the gospel and as they were doing that we were beginning to talk about the implications of a conversion here and we couldn't just allow this girl to stay in New York City and go back to the care of whoever was you know the pseudo care of a pimp or whatever that is all about and we thought you know she's going to need clothes and she's going to need medical treatment and she's going to need a place to live and she's going to need a home and she's going to need a church and she's going to need money and she's going to need education and we were getting excited about how we would provide all that stuff the churches we could call on and the resources we could marshal and the places we could take her and get her completely out of the city of New York and give her a new life and a new start all through this profound new experience with the person of Jesus Christ and as we were making our plans
[time=1056] and getting all excited about it apparently over at the other table they had finished presenting the gospel and answering the questions and doing all they could to help her understand the change that could occur in her life if she were to come to Christ.
[time=1070] The girl finally had come to the point where she heard all she was going to hear and she flat out rejected the gospel and got up and walked out of the diner back into the darkness
[time=1079] both physical and metaphorical of the streets of New York City and she said no to being
[time=1087] reconciled to God she said no I don't want to be reconciled to the true and living God
[time=1093] for whatever reason whatever was in her background whatever was in her past whatever was in her mind whatever she thought about her future she elected to say no to this wonderful concept
[time=1104] and reality of being reconciled to God through the person of Jesus Christ so when I see the
[time=1111] word I don't see seminary notes and profs I see her pray for her from time to time and
[time=1118] hope that I will see her in glory.
[time=1123] This passage is all about what she walked out on and so we'll phrase it in that way just four very basic things I want to teach you from God's word this morning about what she walked out on when she said no to the reconciliation to God.
[time=1138] The first thing she walked out on was a personal relationship with God and with Jesus Christ
[time=1144] a deep intimate friendship with God and the thrust here that we're going to develop for
[time=1150] you is that the extent of reconciliation is comprehensive the word actually means to exchange hostility for friendship the concept is of standing in a hostile posture in a relationship
[time=1164] and it's used even of marriages and you may want to draw that in your mind where there has been a strong relationship and something has happened the trust has been betrayed and the thing is degraded over time and what used to be a good thing is now a hostile thing
[time=1179] reconciliation is the word that exchanges that hostility for putting that thing back together to where it's whole and complete and friendship has been restored and there's love and intimacy.
[time=1191] Now we're not going to be able to look at these verses in exact order because I don't think it will be better off if we don't so let's go with verse 21 and understand the extent of the violation how broken was the relationship between man and God verse 21
[time=1205] and although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind engaged in evil deeds that
[time=1213] is the Bible's way of telling you that the relationship between God and man had blown up it had exploded it was just as fragmented as it could possibly be if you would think
[time=1225] of a business partnership where you go into partnership with a partner to sell something or to make something and provide a living for your family and there's a certain amount of trust and a certain way of doing that as a partnership but imagine for a moment that your partner began to lie about you to you and about you he began to cheat inside the
[time=1246] business and began to embezzle funds and you found out that he had wiped out all the equity in the business taken all you put in and all you built and now you were broke and there was nothing left financially.
[time=1258] Assume next that your partner went ahead with his lies and was able to successfully erode
[time=1264] and undercut the reputation you had tried to build in this community for years and years and years and years and years and so successfully wiped that out that the state revoked your
[time=1275] license to do business maybe you were an engineer maybe you were a doctor maybe you were an attorney and your licensing was taken away from you by the efforts of this alleged partner.
[time=1285] Assume even beyond that that he successfully courted and won the affections of your wife
[time=1292] had an affair with her and she left you for him and your kids chose him too.
[time=1302] That might be close that might be close to what it means in verse 21 when it says we
[time=1308] were alienated and hostile in mind engaged in evil deeds.
[time=1314] This little phrase in your mind alienated and hostile what it's saying there is that
[time=1320] the entity that exists is not by accident it is not the innocence of an individual who didn't know they were violating another individual it was a pre meditated planned decisive
[time=1331] mental choice to be alienated and hostile from God.
[time=1337] It gives evidence in the person's deeds at the end of verse 21 engaged in evil deeds what they think in their mind what they plan in their mind what they scrutinize in their mind they eventually do in their life unless you think you have to become a prostitute to
[time=1351] need reconciliation of God unless you think your deeds are not so bad as hers might have
[time=1358] been listen to a list that the New Testament gives us of the kinds of evil deeds immorality and impurity and sensuality that certainly would encompass this little gal in the streets of New York City and all those who had relations with her that may describe some of you here today who have who have partaken of these kinds of things but it's a much longer list
[time=1378] than that it goes into sorcery and idolatry which talks about any false worship any time
[time=1385] a person would have worshiped a God other than the true living God of the word of God the Bible they have been involved in idolatry and sorcery then it brings up another category which I think all of us fall into relational breakdowns enmity strife jealousy outbursts of anger disputes dissensions and factions and envying have you ever had a fight with
[time=1406] anybody have you ever had any strife in your life have you ever had any enmity any jealousy any outbursts of anger you're in the list that categorizes you as being at hostilities
[time=1418] with God but the list goes on it talks to about drunkenness and carousing and things
[time=1424] like these which kind of opens up the whole arena of drugs and alcohol and the carousing
[time=1431] that goes with it ever had any exposure to that ever been involved in those kinds of things enmity with God emmity with God you say I'm not a bad person I never murdered anybody did you do the things on those list you may not think that it's such a bad deal
[time=1447] but God views it as an atrocity you have blown up your relationship with God you have
[time=1454] fragmented to its farthest degree intentionally in your mind choosing such choices and then
[time=1460] carrying them out in your deeds which really is good news I mean if God can save people
[time=1468] who have done all that kind of stuff he can save us I mean it means that nobody is outside
[time=1474] the scope of being reconciled to God some of you may also think you have no idea I have blast-themed God in the darkness of the night I have clenched my fist and I have cussed at him and I have sworn at him and I have vowed never ever God can't forgive that oh
[time=1493] yes he can oh yes he can he's in the business of forgiving stuff like that you don't understand what I've done I mean the closest people in my life don't know some of the things that I have done and how sinful and how wicked and how to pray and to botch I've been it's
[time=1508] alright it's going to fall somewhere in that category and it's all a part of the category of things which God would reconcile to himself even though you've done those things Isaiah
[time=1519] fifty nine two says this but your iniquities have made you excuse me your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God and your sins have hidden his face from you
[time=1530] so that he does not hear you it is true there are consequences for those choices and for those thoughts and they make us at hostility with God but that's what this passage is about how do you resolve that stuff how do you put that back together how is that reconciled
[time=1547] and so it uses a very very strong word in verse 20 the word reconciled which you just read normally in your English text is in its most strongest sense in the Greek there
[time=1557] is a preposition that's put on the front of this particular word to intensify its meaning it comes out this way you have been totally reconciled to God there is nothing left when you get reconciled to God through Christ every dimension that was broken every fragmentation
[time=1572] that was shattered every offense that was ever conceived of or done the whole nine yards is completely and totally satisfied covered done the relationship is back together and
[time=1582] see he does this because he knows that we don't know how to do this with each other ever been in a fight with somebody ever been angry at somebody ever gotten bitter at somebody ever been really feeling that in that distance with another person and sure you say you're sorry they say they're sorry apologies are made forgiveness is extended but what lingers oftentimes the memory lingers and so with it the bitterness and the anger and you're trying to forgive but boy it's hard because of how much you were hurt and the Apostle
[time=1611] Paul is choosing words in this particular text which are are pushing the notion to its farthest reach God never struggles with any of those feelings towards you when you are reconciled to him through Christ he just wipes the entire thing clean it's all it's all covered
[time=1629] over it's all dealt with it's all done it's it is no more in his mind when he thinks about you
[time=1635] totally reconciled you know it's also in verse 20 it says that the word peace is used
[time=1642] having made peace through the blood of his cross and what that word describes it that's the positive side of getting back together you not only get back together and say you're sorry and do the forgiveness thing but then peace is that abiding positive condition of enjoying one
[time=1659] another after you've made up he's saying I not only totally reconcile you to myself I hold
[time=1666] nothing more against you but we get to move to the next level of friendship we get to enjoy each other and bask in each other's relationship it's a wonderful truth you won't find it anywhere
[time=1676] but with God and it's hard to comprehend that he's actually capable of doing this one of the more riveting examples of it comes to us out of the Old Testament
[time=1687] and you see the nation of Israel kept running away from God they kept doing this spiritual adultery thing they kept they kept betraying his trust and worshiping another it's like spiritual
[time=1698] adultery and he kept calling him back he kept calling him back he kept saying I can forgive you I can put this thing back together it'll be okay trust me he's saying but they couldn't understand it so he gave them a living illustration he told one of his prophets he says I want you
[time=1714] to go marry so-and-so so he went and he went and married so-and-so and what God knew was that
[time=1720] this woman would turn out to be an adulterous he told his prophet to marry a woman he knew would
[time=1727] become an adulterous so that he can make this living illustration clear to the minds of the people who lived in the nation of Israel well not only did she become an adulterous she became a flagrant adulterous and got passed from one man to another man to another man to another man
[time=1742] until she had finally fallen out of the social graces of her particular community and culture
[time=1749] and what that happened in that day is you could end up being sold as a slave
[time=1755] which is what exactly what happened to her she she outlived her physical beauty and her
[time=1761] usefulness as far as winning the favor of men through adultery eventually was sold day by day
[time=1768] as a prostitute and eventually got sold as a human being in the marketplace unbelievable
[time=1774] and and on the day of her sale this prophet this man of God who's known by everybody in the town
[time=1782] as a man of God he shows up and you can hear the rumble that goes across the crowd boy i bet he's here i bet he likes i bet he wishes that she gets bought by the meanest cruelest wickedest
[time=1795] slave owner he she could possibly get bought by her i bet he hopes she's beaten and abused and and and sexually mistreated i mean i bet he's just eating this up i bet he soaked in this day up
[time=1806] because he was good to her and she walked out and she never came back and now he's getting his day of vindication and then they probably just like well they're just dropped because god had sent him there for a purpose god said this to the men go again love a woman who was loved by her husband yet an adulterous
[time=1827] even as the lord loves israel in other words show them through your love for her in an
[time=1834] unconditional manner my ability to forgive over and over and over again even the most wicked offenses
[time=1842] he says as i love israel even though they turn to other gods and have their raisin cakes so it says this is obviously the prophet hosea and his wife is gomer he says so i bought her for
[time=1853] myself for 15 shackles of silver and a homer and a half of barley he paid a really good price and
[time=1860] in the day that was a lot of money for a quality slave and then he said this to her don't miss this
[time=1867] then he said this you shall stay with me for many days
[time=1874] you shall not play the harlot nor shall you have a man and so i will also be towards you
[time=1883] and he did it he bought her he bought her back and he stayed faithful to her and he loved her
[time=1892] he completely reconciled that relationship that is what god is trying to say here to you this morning
[time=1898] god is saying and god is saying about that little girl on the streets of new york when you walk out of a relationship and offer to come to christ you say no to a totally reconciled relationship with the true and living god
[time=1917] with no grudges nothing held harbored against you total complete forgiveness
[time=1924] the second thing that this gal walked out on was the provision of christ the provision of christ do you realize that as she walks back
[time=1936] out on the streets of new york city there is no other source of salvation for her except christ
[time=1944] there's no other religion out there there's no other sect there's no way she can earn it on her own she walks into the condition of absolute hopelessness separated from god and the covenant promises in christ she walks out of the provision of christ
[time=1960] and the provision of christ you'll see in verse 20 you see there it says he reconciled all things
[time=1966] to himself having made peace how do you do it through the blood of his cross that's the provision
[time=1973] of christ the blood of his cross look at verse 22 you'll see another reference to his death yet he has now reconciled you how in his fleshly body through death
[time=1986] absolutely astounding to me the irony is unbelievable what is it that i could do that would make you hate me all the rest of your days
[time=1999] never want to see me again never really be able to forgive me never really want to do anything with me the rest what is the one thing i could do the one that came to my mind was i could fail
[time=2011] to appreciate i could fail to understand then i could abuse and curse and slap and hit and mock
[time=2020] and scourge and crucify your child that would do it wouldn't it i mean you might muster all the
[time=2028] christian strength you have to forgive me but when you had seen me over time misunderstand and fail to appreciate and abuse and curse and slap and hit and mock and scourge and eventually
[time=2039] crucify your child on a cross you'd be hard pressed to be reconciled to me
[time=2046] the irony of this situation is that is exactly how god reconciled us to himself
[time=2055] he gave us his only child he gave us his son and we proceeded to misunderstand and fail to
[time=2063] appreciate and abuse and curse and slap and hit and scourge and crucify him and somehow in the
[time=2070] mystery of god that was the tool that was the means of the reconciliation you see we were at a
[time=2078] total impasse with god the relationship was at a total impasse god being holy could not sacrifice
[time=2084] his standard of holiness and justice he couldn't be other than he is which means he couldn't just wink at our sin he couldn't just overlook the iniquities in our lives the fact that we are
[time=2095] alienated and hostile in mind and engaged in evil deeds he couldn't just pretend that never existed it would violate who he is you and i on the other hand were also at an impasse with him
[time=2106] because there was nothing we could do to make up for what we had done a million saris would not
[time=2112] have made it a thousand apologies would not have covered it all of our money couldn't cover it all the works we could ever work would never be able to satisfy the violation we had caused in that
[time=2123] relationship with him absolute total impasse god and man separated by man's sin and nothing
[time=2130] either could do unless unless the sin is dealt with and there was only one person to deal with that
[time=2142] god's only son first peter 224 says and he himself speaking of christ bore our sins in his
[time=2148] body on the cross that we might die to sin and live to righteousness for by his wounds we were
[time=2156] healed as christ takes and this is the crux of the whole message of salvation this is the point of the
[time=2162] cross christ became the curse of men and bore the curse of sin and paid the price so that the impasse
[time=2170] between god and man could be forever reconciled so the relationship could be put back together
[time=2179] totally with no exceptions with no grudges held because christ paid for every single last sin
[time=2185] and when that little girl in new york city walked out
[time=2191] she walked out on the provision of christ that's the only place in all the universe
[time=2200] the cross of christ where the problem between man and his god can be resolved
[time=2206] the third thing she walked out on and this is really intriguing when you think of it in terms
[time=2213] of her life and it gives us insight into our own she walked out on the perfection of christ
[time=2219] the perfection of christ you see when you get right with god through jesus christ you accept him as your savior he gives you his perfection it's described verse 22
[time=2232] look at it three terms describe his perfection it you know a zillion terms couldn't describe it all
[time=2239] but these three take a stab at it yet he has now reconciled you and his fleshly body through death in order to present you before him how three things holy secondly blameless and thirdly
[time=2252] beyond reproach oh my goodness you mean to tell me that the provision of christ can supply forgiveness for sin and then the addition
[time=2265] of his perfection so that a that a teen prostitute on the streets of new york city could become check it holy yeah that's what that means that means that when she is glorified she'll be able
[time=2278] to stand from god here in this location and all of the wickedness that she both did and saw
[time=2286] and had pushed upon her all the sin will be over there completely separate from her
[time=2293] she will stand holy before god you and i will be able to stand before god in this location
[time=2302] and all of the wickedness and the selfishness and the corruption of our lives will stand separate
[time=2309] and distinct and it will be over there we will be over here and there will be no connection between us there'll be no association totally separate that's what the word holy means it means to cut
[time=2320] apart to be separate from sin the second thing she'll be as blameless oh i like this blameless
[time=2330] is the term that was used in the old testament to describe the sacrificial animal and you couldn't offer just any animal to god in the temple sacrifice you didn't just grab your scrawny little lamb
[time=2341] who'd been beaten up and was slightly deformed and had a tattered ear and whose legs were too short and and as his his will didn't work right you don't just grab this thing and haul it into the temple and say here's my sacrifice for my sin you've had to find an animal that was without
[time=2356] spot in the literal rendition it was blameless it was perfect its confirmation was perfect its
[time=2362] eyes were perfect its ears were perfect its legs were perfect its coat was perfect that's what she's going to be that's exactly what she's going to be she's going to stand before
[time=2373] god and she is going to be blameless without spot
[time=2381] the third thing that he says the perfection of christ provides for her she'll be beyond reproach beyond reproach that means without accusation without accusation you see because she gets forgiven through the the sacrifice of christ
[time=2399] when she stands before god none of the men that she entertained will be able to say she did this
[time=2408] they will not be able to come into that courtroom and say she was a wicked prostitute their claims will never be able to be marshaled or laid against her because she will be free
[time=2420] from any charge for christ will have paid the entire debt in full leaving her with no one in the
[time=2426] world or in the spiritual dimension to lay a charge against her and the same is true of me and you
[time=2435] we get to stand there where where the accusation should come in like waves upon the sand where they should pile up like mountains where they should just over over burden whatever place we're in I
[time=2447] mean as our as the record of our sin just goes and goes and the accusations come and no
[time=2453] you can't bring any of those against me have all been covered i've been totally reconciled to god
[time=2460] all those issues are dealt with you cannot bring a charge against me i'm holy i'm blameless and i'm beyond reproach because of the reconciliation which comes to me in
[time=2473] christ well a fourth thing fourth thing and that perfection is yet future for her and it is future
[time=2482] for me but what is in the here and now she walked out on the power of christ to live a different life
[time=2491] she forfeited the only source of true power to change the way she lives from the inside out
[time=2499] look at verse 23 you'll see it if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established instead
[time=2506] fast and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven and of which i paul was made a minister in other words this is saying
[time=2517] when you are truly reconciled to god some significant things happen inside your life and and here again
[time=2524] they the metaphor they gets brought in is one of architecture and those of you who are architects
[time=2530] or engineers or those of you who are in the process of building a house or an office building or a building you'll appreciate what in a special way what what the apostle paul is is driving at here
[time=2539] three three basic terms first of all he says established you see it there in verse 23 if indeed
[time=2545] you continue in the faith firmly established that means to lay a strong foundation you think of the foundation upon which your house sets and the cement and the steel that all are apart and make that up what happens in reconciliation is you get a strong foundation secondly you
[time=2562] become steadfast which is also an architectural term which means that the structure that gets
[time=2568] built on the foundation is firm i mean it's connected it it stays together it's powerful it's
[time=2575] well in fact as you'll notice the third term it is unmovable or not moved away that could have
[time=2582] been translated earthquake proof because the actual term is translated earthquake in other places in other words and by the way this would have been of particular interest to the colossi
[time=2592] because they were in an area played with earthquakes i'd be like saying to people in california we can build you a building that has such an incredible foundation and a top at a structure
[time=2603] that it is earthquake proof now of course we haven't figured out how to do that yet we may never be able to do that but in our christian faith in in being strong in the gospel that is
[time=2613] exactly what is given in reconciliation the foundation and the structure are unshakeable
[time=2620] that's why he can say you will be holy and blameless and beyond reproach at the end of verse 22
[time=2627] if indeed you continue in the faith it's not as if you have to work for your salvation the bible categorically denies that what it's saying is because you are truly saved you will be firmly
[time=2638] established and steadfast and you will not be able to be moved away from what from the hope of the gospel the reality of salvation and reconciliation through the person of jesus christ that's why it is always the greatest joy in my life when i have the privilege of leading somebody
[time=2655] to christ the first desire in my heart is to spend time with them on a weekly basis to disciple them
[time=2662] because i want to witness the foundation which god has given them and i want to watch the structure
[time=2669] of christianity go up in their life and i want to know within a year or two or three years time
[time=2675] there's a certain sense that you begin to get from them as they as they give evidence of their own growth and the spirit of god in their life and their willingness to to submit to the word of god there there's a sense yes that was true salvation how do i know because the foundation is strong and
[time=2691] the structure is there they're unmovable and we've actually seen somebody come to christ
[time=2698] in my trip to california in january i met with a couple that we had led to the lord uh
[time=2704] hidey and i in our street evangelism on our block and boy we've seen some exciting things we've seen
[time=2710] the foundation go in and we've seen the structure come the first thing was with their kids just kids
[time=2716] out of control didn't know what they were doing it was a horrible scene the thing was bad for the kid the kid was losing his hair so much stress a little four-year-old boy just horrible we just you know we just began after they came to christ to offer this and offer that and they now have gone through this program that we're offering in our own church called growing kids god's way we're got a pilot going right now we hope to make it available soon you can't believe you hear him talk it's just it's a different couple they just it's a different kid it's a different household it's completely different with respect to their child and you see the evidence of salvation and then he didn't know much about the bible so he signed up for a build course that they're offering in a church out there and he studied the book of acts and i got to read his papers he sent me his papers and i'm reading this guy watching the spirit of god
[time=2763] move through the early church he's drawing principles and establishing his mind in what is really going on in the world he didn't get any of that as a child he said oh structure's going up
[time=2773] yo man look at this it's getting strong now here was the big one we're at his meal at in his house
[time=2779] for a meal this last trip in january he says man i just got to figure out now i don't think i'm
[time=2785] given enough money to the church nothing you know money the guy's a businessman he was raised to make
[time=2792] money it's his whole family deal is make money and and buy extra houses and stuff like that and he's
[time=2798] sitting there i mean he's showing the evidence that this this establishes from foundation the structure is touching all the way to his pocketbook he's saying you know we're giving about 10 percent
[time=2810] on a regular basis but we've got a building program going on how do we determine how much extra to give and and i'm trying to answer this question but in my mind i'm trying to stay in my seat because i'm so excited it's like you know praise god i can see the foundation i can see the
[time=2826] structure he's earthquake proof he's not going to depart from the hope of the gospel
[time=2832] when you walk out on christ when you walk away from christ you walk out on the only source of true
[time=2840] power to change your life let me close let's go to second grithians chapter five just for a little
[time=2847] bit of application and then we're we're done with this one for today
[time=2854] i don't know if you know this but the book of second grithians is one of the last that paul
[time=2861] ever wrote paul opens the book in chapter one by saying we had the sentence of death within ourselves
[time=2867] he says we thought we were going to die as he looked around he noticed that most of the
[time=2873] churches he'd ministered to and planted and and had worked with were in trouble they were not doing well they were struggling with disunity and struggling with bad doctrine and false teachers and all kinds of stuff just read the new testament you'll find out all the stuff he was struggling with as he looks at these churches in other words he had no concept of how significantly he had been used by god to really have found the new testament church he thought himself a marginal failure and considered giving up on the whole cause
[time=2902] in fact he found this whole process of giving out the gospel almost too much for him just go
[time=2909] back to chapter few and for just second chapter four look at verse seven he says we have this treasure he means by that the gospel in earthen vessels he means by that his own body
[time=2919] that the surpassing greatness of the power may be of god and not from ourselves he says man
[time=2925] this is a weird deal god takes the treasure of the world the gospel and sticks it in people like me who are made of earthen vessels these these bodies we can't handle this stuff verse eight but i'm afflicted in every way but i'm not crushed i'm perplexed but not despairing i'm persecuted but not forsaken i'm struck down but not destroyed verse ten always carrying about in the body the dying of jesus that the life of jesus also may be manifested in our body you get the discouragement do you understand i mean he is getting the
[time=2953] tar beat out of him as he is a faithful apostle to share the faith he says he didn't put me in a strong enough vessel to take this kind of abuse it's killing me no chapter five he gives you four
[time=2965] reasons why he refuses to give up four reasons why he refuses to stop sharing the faith number one
[time=2972] comes in chapter five verse one he says this i'm going to get resurrected for we know that if the
[time=2978] earthly tent which is our house is torn down we have a building from god a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens he says you can do what you want to my physical body you can beat it up you can try to crush it you can smack it you can persecute it you can strike it
[time=2995] down doesn't matter i'm getting a new one it's just that simple i'm getting a brand new one and it's
[time=3001] going to be eternal nobody can touch it then the second reason he refuses to stop sharing the gospel
[time=3008] is found in verse ten he's thinking about the judgment seat of christ he says for we must all
[time=3014] appear before the judgment seat of christ that each one may be recompensed for his deeds in the body according to what he has done whether good or bad he's not worried about losing his salvation he's worrying about look at the last part of verse nine being pleasing to the lord when the lord takes that scrutinizing gaze at his life and begins to give him rewards or withhold rewards paul says i want to be pleasing to christ so i'm going to keep sharing the gospel i don't
[time=3041] care what you do to me i'm going to keep on sharing the third reason is found in verse 14 he says
[time=3048] for the love of christ controls us having concluded this that one died for all therefore all died
[time=3054] and he died for all that they who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died
[time=3060] and rose again on their behalf he says i can't stop sharing the gospel because it's all about the love of christ the word controls means to be caught in a rock and a hard place the love of christ is
[time=3071] to my left the love of christ is to my right the love of christ is behind me it's above me it's below me and it's squirting me out i have got to evangelize people i have got to tell people
[time=3082] i'm controlled i'm constrained by this awesome powerful love of christ which brought him to the
[time=3088] point of death for all of humanity now as you might have guessed the fourth reason is because paul can never ever ever get over the notion
[time=3098] that the true and living god would allow him to play a part in taking someone who is
[time=3106] alienated and hostile and engaged in evil deeds and play a part in bringing that relationship back
[time=3113] not to partial but to total reconciliation look at it in verse 18 and 19 now all these things are
[time=3120] from god who reconciled us to himself through christ here it is and gave us the ministry of
[time=3126] reconciliation you and i have been given the word gave in the greek is past tense have been given
[time=3133] the ministry of record we've all it's ours verse 19 namely that god was in christ reconciling
[time=3140] the world to himself not counting their trespasses against them here it is again and he has committed to us the word of reconciliation he can't get over it he never wants to recover
[time=3152] from it it's the most exciting thing in his life he can take people who are in hostility with god
[time=3159] and put them at peace with god he gets a part in there he says yeah i'm not quitting i'm gonna
[time=3165] keep right on going i'm going to keep right on pursuing let me say this to you let me say it's
[time=3172] very clear to you if if your life does not have at the core of what you are a driving passion
[time=3186] to do your part in the ministry of reconciliation you are out of balance
[time=3193] your life is out of balance also your life will be unavoidably unfulfilling
[time=3202] you will never know the sense of fulfillment that god would have you i'm not promising you total fulfillment but it will not be as fulfilling as it ought to be and thirdly it will be uneventful
[time=3212] in terms of eternal consequences say it again if your life does not have at its core the passion
[time=3219] of being involved in reconciling people to god your life will inevitably be one out of balance
[time=3225] two unfulfilling as much as it otherwise could be and three uneventful
[time=3231] in terms of eternity and that's why i am so excited about what is going on around here
[time=3240] i left that last outreach service like somewhere on cloud nine if they have a 10 or 11 i was there it was just it was more than i could stand and the way i've tried to describe it to friends
[time=3251] is it's like black rock is this huge powerful battleship and you picture the guns in your mind and their capacity to hurl these huge shells hundreds of
[time=3262] miles direct hits onto the banks of enemy territory and in our modern day they have these
[time=3268] missiles these tomahawk missiles that come out from them and their computer guided and their atomic and they go through people's front doors i mean unbelievable power to do damage to the enemy
[time=3278] black rock battleship and what it has felt like to me is that over time slowly somehow
[time=3285] the ship got caught in a current and it began to drift just ever so slightly so that the guns
[time=3291] were no longer properly pointed and they began to stop being used and fired
[time=3299] and it just feels a little bit to me like what we've been going through here is this battleship is getting back online with the enemy territory and the guns are starting
[time=3312] to get uncorked you know you can see those big things they stick in the front of those guns and the shells were loaded and on that particular sunday we just we were just boom boom boom boom
[time=3322] you know they're just hurling stuff at the unsaved world we were penetrating the kingdom of darkness
[time=3328] with the gospel of jesus christ just unbelievable it's so right it is so healthy it is so much with
[time=3337] the church and what the individuals in the church are supposed to be doing just had a marvelous time
[time=3343] telling everybody about you out in washington just bragging all over you just just bragging i was a bit see bragging might have falsehood to it how was you telling the truth about you all your responsiveness all your willingness to be trained all of your desire
[time=3357] to accomplish this task which got us put before us well it's a wonderful thing god is in the business of taking people who hate him
[time=3368] and fixing that relationship to where they love him and he wants to use you and he wants to use
[time=3377] me and that may be the bigger miracle because we know the stuff of which we're made let's pray to god
[time=3389] how could anything be more exciting than being reconciled to god and maybe you're hearing about
[time=3402] this for the very first time and you've never really understood what christ did on the cross and how you could put your relationship back together totally and completely with god the father
[time=3413] or maybe you've kind of heard this message a long time that have never really personalized it in your own life and made christ your own and made that decision to accept christ as your savior well in either case i'm going to lead us in a prayer here in just a second i invite you to pray along if you say in your heart what i'm saying out loud if you mean it god will hear you and the
[time=3432] sacrifice of christ will apply to your life and you'll be reconciled to god let me invite you to pray with me right now father i know that i am a sinner i know that i have been alienated and hostile and engaged in evil deeds and i understand today that i can have
[time=3447] forgiveness and be reconciled to you through the shed blood of jesus christ through his death on the cross and i accept that forgiveness i accept christ into my life i take him as my lord and my
[time=3459] savior and i look forward to living in a reconciled condition at peace with you and i pray these
[time=3466] things in jesus name amen well if you pray to receive that prayer we'd love to hear from you we'd
