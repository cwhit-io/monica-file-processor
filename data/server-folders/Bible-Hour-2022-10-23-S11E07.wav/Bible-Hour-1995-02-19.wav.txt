[time=0] The gospel is moved forward as people, individuals like you and like me become that messenger
[time=9] who returns from the battlefront as it were and tells others who have yet to learn.
[time=16] The good news.
[time=24] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=28] We're glad you've joined us. Whether you're just starting out in ministry or have been faithfully serving for the last twenty-five years, whether you're in full-time vocational ministry or just volunteering at your local church, today's message is designed to encourage
[time=43] you by exploring the seven key principles that Paul outlines in Colossians 1 for people
[time=49] in the ministry. He'll cover the who, the what, why, when and how of effective ministry
[time=56] for the cause of Christ. Let's join our service as the sanctuary choir sings a medley of songs
[time=63] entitled "I'm Yours."
[time=87] [MUSIC - 181 seconds]
[time=274] - Hi, my name's Russell Moore and I wanna welcome you
[time=285] to the Bible Hour and thank you for joining us today.
[time=288] I trust that you are rejoicing in the grace of God today.
[time=293] I was just speaking with a man who I love very much who was just struggling in his own life to live in the exemplary manner that he knows the Lord would have of him and we talk through how God is a gracious, forgiving, compassionate God and how He forgives us and how when He forgives us, He separates us from our sin as far as the East is from the West and I don't know how you're feeling today or where you're at in your relationship with the Lord.
[time=320] If you're struggling with some unconfessed sin and some guilt, I just wanna remind you of the great, compassionate, merciful God that we know through Jesus Christ.
[time=330] Also, I wanna let you know about a wonderful opportunity to come and worship God here at Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=337] On April 13th at 7.30 in the evening, we'll have the privilege of hosting a concert with Steve Green and I know many of you know him and are thankful for God's ministry through Steve.
[time=349] He'll be with us, that's April 13th.
[time=351] That's a Thursday night at 7.30 PM.
[time=355] And you're all welcome to join us.
[time=356] You can purchase tickets for this wonderful concert through our church office here at Blackhawk Baptist Church or at any one of the local Christian bookstores and those tickets will go on sale March 6.
[time=368] So that'll be next week and you can stop by to the church or one of the bookstores and pick up your tickets for the Steve Green concert.
[time=375] Again, that's April 13th, Thursday evening at 7.30 PM.
[time=378] We'd love to see you there.
[time=380] Also, I wanna let you know that if you're watching the Bible Hour on a Sunday, if this happens to be the 26th Sunday morning about seven o'clock, you're welcome to come to one of our outreach services that we're having even today, February 26th, we have special services this morning at 9.10 and 10.50.
[time=398] And these are what we call outreach services.
[time=401] We've established a theme for our morning messages this morning.
[time=404] It'll be, it's not my fault.
[time=407] And we'll talk about how we wanna shift responsibility for our behavior onto other people.
[time=412] As I say, it'll be a very unusual format.
[time=415] We'll be using a different style of music and we'll have some drama that'll help, I think in a very clever way, put this topic into your mind and then I'll be speaking on that topic.
[time=425] And you're welcome to come visit with us this morning.
[time=428] I invite, especially those of you who are not in the habit of coming to a church on Sunday morning, maybe it's, church is a little standoffish for you and you're not quite comfortable in some of the, the more staunch approach that maybe you've been experiencing in churches in the past.
[time=446] Let me assure you, this service will not resemble that at all.
[time=449] It'll be full of wonderfully and exciting, I think very relevant, interesting ways to present the truth from God's Word.
[time=456] And we'd love for you to come and for you to feel welcome.
[time=460] Well, again, we're just thankful for the opportunity to minister to you this morning.
[time=463] Today we're talking about seven ministry principles by which to live and the Apostle Paul kind of opens his heart and kind of reveals his motivation, his level of desire, the principles, the values, the, the, the things that keep him faithful to God.
[time=481] And so we trust that you'll be minister to as we open from Colossians chapter one and look at how excited Paul is to be a part of the process of bringing people in a reconciled relationship to God.
[time=494] Well, at this time, let's turn to the, return to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=498] (upbeat music)
[time=519] [MUSIC - 218 seconds]
[time=740] - Well, what a tremendous morning of music and focus
[time=752] and worship on this theme of ministry and being involved in personal ministry.
[time=756] Let me invite you to take your Bible this morning and come with me to Colossians chapter one.
[time=762] And the theme we look at this morning, as you have been told, is ministry.
[time=766] Personal ministry and service in the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=771] For those of you who are visiting, it may be helpful for you to know that we are in the practice of studying God's word when we meet together for worship services such as this.
[time=781] We've settled on the book of Colossians and we are making our way through this first chapter.
[time=786] And we come this morning to the last paragraph in this chapter verses 24 to 29.
[time=792] And I guess I just need to add that when I selected this book, I had no idea how thrilling it would be this first chapter to land as it has in the timing of things that are happening in our church.
[time=806] And we're focusing on evangelism.
[time=807] We're focusing on outreach.
[time=809] We're focusing on turning our hearts to the Lord's great commission.
[time=813] And to be honest, I had no idea that this first chapter dealt so much with the gospel.
[time=819] And as I was preparing to preach on these last few verses, as would be my custom, I reviewed the paragraph to ensure that I understood the flow and it was so moving, I wanna do that with you this morning just briefly.
[time=833] You just gotta be reminded of how this thing works.
[time=835] You remember about six weeks ago?
[time=837] We talked about the good news.
[time=839] And the good news is a term that was used in the ancient day to describe the message that a messenger would bring when he came from the battle.
[time=850] You and I would have lived in a city.
[time=852] It would have been protected.
[time=852] We would have had walls.
[time=853] We would have had word that there was encroaching enemy.
[time=855] We would have sent our valiant warriors out there to fight them, but without cellular phones and radios, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=862] We would have no concept of how that battle was doing until the messenger came.
[time=867] And we would be perilously waiting.
[time=871] I mean, our circumstances would be uncertain, our future uncertain, our lives hanging in the balance as it were, and we would be waiting.
[time=878] And eventually we'd see this guy coming and we could probably tell from before he got there by the gate that he carried and the way he carried himself and eventually the expression on his face that what we all wanted to hear was true.
[time=890] There was good news, the gospel.
[time=893] We were winning or we had won the battle.
[time=897] And of course, Paul grabs the meaning and the passion and the energy of that picture and brings it into the good news, not about a physical battle between two enemy armies, but the spiritual battle that's going on between the God of heaven and Satan and all of his demonic hosts for the souls of men, your soul, my soul.
[time=918] And the gospel is this, it is the good news that has come to you from someone, some person, that God has won the battle through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=930] That salvation, men's souls can be redeemed from their sin and from the penalty of their sin that we can spend forever in the fellowship and the presence of God.
[time=940] That is the good news.
[time=942] That is what has come to us.
[time=943] And that is what Paul is saying to these young believers at Colossae.
[time=947] There is great news and it's called the gospel.
[time=950] You remember in verse four, it is apprehended or it's personalized through faith.
[time=954] Verse five, it gives us hope for the future.
[time=957] That is heaven.
[time=958] Verse six, it goes out into all the world that can penetrate every dimension of the globe.
[time=964] Verse six, it bears fruit in our lives.
[time=967] We are changed and transformed.
[time=969] Verse six at the end, and maybe the best part of the whole thing is that it's by the grace of God.
[time=974] It's something we can't earn.
[time=976] It's nothing we deserve.
[time=977] It is his unmerited favor, this good news that Christ has won the battle.
[time=982] He moves from that into the next paragraph verses nine to 14.
[time=987] And I call this the prayer of the gospel.
[time=990] And Paul then gets down on his knees.
[time=992] These people having received the good news and been saved, but he gets down on his knees because he wants them to maximize the reality of Christ in their life.
[time=1002] What he's fearful is that they'll have been saved in the sense of eternal salvation, but the day to day of their life won't be as transformed as it could be.
[time=1011] The victory, in other words, is able to change the way we live.
[time=1014] So in verse nine, he prays at the end that we would be filled with the knowledge of his will.
[time=1019] In other words, we'd be consumed with God's desire for our life.
[time=1024] Verse 10, that we would walk in a manner worthy of the Lord.
[time=1028] Verse 11, that we would then be strengthened by the power of God to live that changed and transformed life.
[time=1036] So he begins with the gospel.
[time=1038] He then has the prayer of the gospel, then the next paragraph.
[time=1041] It says, if you're saying, well, who won this battle?
[time=1045] I mean, what great general and what great lieutenants and mighty men of valor went off, who are they?
[time=1051] I wanna meet them, I wanna say thank you.
[time=1053] I mean, who won this battle for me?
[time=1056] Christ said it's not a group of people, it is only one person.
[time=1060] Excuse me, Paul says it is but one person, the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1064] And we get introduced to the person of the gospel in verses 15 through 18.
[time=1069] None other than Christ, who is he?
[time=1071] Remember the resume?
[time=1072] Who is this guy?
[time=1073] Number one, he is God incarnate so that we can understand God.
[time=1079] What has he done?
[time=1080] I mean, what are his accomplishments, verse 16?
[time=1083] Well, he created all things, both in heaven and on earth.
[time=1087] Well, what is he doing right now, verse 17?
[time=1090] In him, all things hold together.
[time=1093] He is sustaining the universe at this second.
[time=1096] Well, what are you doing in the future?
[time=1098] The end of verse 18, he will have first place in everything.
[time=1103] Man, that's the person of the gospel.
[time=1105] He is the one who is responsible for our victory.
[time=1109] He is the one who paid the price.
[time=1111] And then Paul moves in his thinking to the next paragraph, which is the peace of the gospel.
[time=1118] Not only has the victory been won, not only can we enjoy salvation, but we are put at total relational peace with God.
[time=1124] The word is reconciliation and verse 20.
[time=1127] And again in verse 22, yet he has now reconciled you in the fleshly body through his death.
[time=1133] That means there is an end to the hostilities that existed between man and his God.
[time=1138] And they are put back together to enjoy the fruit of relationship, the peace of it all.
[time=1143] It happened through the blood of Christ, as it says in verse 20.
[time=1147] In verse 22, it happened in order to present you before him holy and blameless and beyond reproach.
[time=1152] Remember the prostitute on the city streets.
[time=1155] They're in New York who would, because of the work of Christ, be standing before God someday, absolutely holy and blameless and beyond reproach.
[time=1163] And if he can do that with her, he can do that with us.
[time=1167] Absolute unbelievable, perfection of Christ given to us.
[time=1171] Verse 23, then the last part of this reconciliation thought, if indeed you continue in the faith, firmly established and steadfast and not moved away from the hope of the gospel.
[time=1181] In other words, it can transform your life.
[time=1184] You can be established in the gospel and be steadfast in the gospel and earthquake proof in the gospel.
[time=1190] So the gospel is given in the first paragraph.
[time=1194] The prayer of the gospel, given in the second, the person of the gospel, given in the third, the peace of the gospel, given in the fourth.
[time=1200] And today we get to come to the progress of the gospel.
[time=1204] Remember this is a battle scene and people are waiting.
[time=1207] People are in need, desperate need of good news.
[time=1212] And the issue and the question is, how is it that we become the messenger of God?
[time=1218] How are we the ones now who must give it to the next person who has not yet heard it?
[time=1223] And so Paul really just unfolds some of the principles of ministry that he has in his own life and they will be for us principles of ministry.
[time=1232] In my library, I have books about Lincoln and Schwarzkopf and John Wooden and great, great leaders and I read them with pen in hand and I try to deduce some of the great principles that have marked their thinking to which they have strapped themselves, if you will.
[time=1249] And I try where I can to incorporate that.
[time=1252] But I look longest and hardest at people like the Apostle Paul for here you have inspired writing of potentially one of the greatest men of God who has ever lived and he opens his heart to us this morning and says this, these are the seven principles which I have committed myself to in my effort to be an effective minister or servant of the gospel.
[time=1276] We'll look for his principles, we'll look for his perspective, his attitudes, his core values.
[time=1282] Now for some of you, you've never been in ministry.
[time=1285] Talking to a dear friend this week, a man that I love greatly and he was saying to me, you know, I've been saved now for a while and all of a sudden I just wanna be apart.
[time=1297] I wanna serve, I wanna find something I can do in this church.
[time=1300] He was kind of examining what he might have by way to offer and making suggestions.
[time=1304] Maybe I could do this, maybe I could do that.
[time=1306] I've never talked to him about it before in my life.
[time=1308] It's just that thing that happens inside of a person and they're truly saved, they want to be involved in the ministry of the church.
[time=1314] For some of you in that category, you'll mark these seven, maybe for the first time, oh, I get it.
[time=1320] So these are the principles that are to undergird the ministry in my life.
[time=1324] For others of you, like the elders that we just heard from in ministry for 25 years, for those of us who've been at it a while, maybe this is a refresher course, maybe these are benchmarks because we might be prone to find other motives or subordinate motives or we might lose the passion that we may have once had.
[time=1344] So it stands as a refresher to even those who have been in the ministry a great deal of time.
[time=1350] I'm excited to give these to you this morning.
[time=1352] Number one, the source of the ministry is God.
[time=1356] The source of the ministry is God himself.
[time=1361] Look at the end of verse 23.
[time=1364] He says, "I, Paul, was made a minister."
[time=1370] He's saying, "I didn't choose this for myself.
[time=1372] I didn't sit around and say, 'Gee whiz, what do I want to be when I grow up?'" I think it'll be a minister of the gospel, no.
[time=1379] In fact, he had already chosen his life vocation.
[time=1381] It was to be a Pharisee, a self-righteous, hypocritical individual who was heaping the heavy load in the religion on unsuspecting souls.
[time=1390] So Zellot, was he in his false religious system that he began to persecute Christians?
[time=1395] He was a Christian killer.
[time=1397] He did it as a living.
[time=1398] It was his vocation, that was his choice, but God put him into the ministry.
[time=1405] God made him a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[time=1408] Look at verse 25, it says, "Of this church, I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me." Man, the word stewardship means to be a slave in another man's house.
[time=1422] We don't see any of that, I guess, in our day and age, but there was a time when you would hire a person, own a person, a slave, you would make him the steward of your house, you would make him in charge of all the matters of your house.
[time=1433] It is not his house, it is not really his concern.
[time=1436] It is your concern that he does by your choosing as he dispatches your will in your house.
[time=1442] Paul is saying, "I've got this responsibility to pass the message on, not by my own choosing, but the master of the house.
[time=1451] Christ himself has put me into the ministry." And in Paul's case, it's very dramatic.
[time=1456] Happened on the Damascus road, he was on his way to kill some more Christians, and the Lord appeared to him, converted him, got him saved, and then said, "Now, minister to the Gentiles, your specific mission for me, spread the good news that the victory for the souls of men has been won, you tell that to the Gentiles." He says, "In the first Timothy one, I thank Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has strengthened me because he considered me faithful, putting me into service." Very well aware that he was serving at the direction of Christ.
[time=1488] First Timothy two, verse seven.
[time=1490] And for this, meaning the gospel, I was appointed a preacher and an apostle as a teacher to the Gentiles, appointed.
[time=1499] I was made a minister of the gospel by Christ himself, and he saved Paul.
[time=1507] He then gifted Paul to do this particular mission, and then mandated it in his life.
[time=1512] And maybe there are those of you here today saying, "Man, I wish that would have happened to me." I mean, I wish the Lord would have shown up like when I was on my way down Colosseum there and just kind of moved my car over and did that thing with me and got me saved, and then audibly said to me, "You will be a minister of mine to the Gentiles." Didn't happen to any of you.
[time=1533] That's not how the Lord works in this particular day and age.
[time=1535] But I want to say to you this, in no uncertain terms, you are no less saved by the intention of Christ.
[time=1542] You are no less gifted by the intention of Christ, and you are no less mandated to ministry by the intention of Christ than was the apostle Paul.
[time=1550] Wasn't as dramatic, but it's just as real.
[time=1555] It is just as one of my favorite verses in all of scripture is over in Ephesians.
[time=1561] And it says there that we are his masterpiece, that because we're born again, we are his masterpiece created in Christ Jesus for good works, which he prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them, the word masterpiece.
[time=1575] We are his unbelievable design.
[time=1579] You see, it is true of us, as it is true of Paul, that he intended and specifically saved us.
[time=1585] At that moment, he gifted us with spiritual gifts, combined with our past experiences and our natural aptitudes, and all of that came together as this marvelous masterpiece in the hand of God.
[time=1596] Not just to do anything, not just to be anybody, but to minister according to the good works which he prepared beforehand, before the foundation of the world, that we should walk in them.
[time=1610] You are no less called to ministry than is the apostle Paul by virtue of your salvation.
[time=1616] That's an amazing truth.
[time=1619] And by the way, this morning we are not just talking about your ministry or your service as it would relate to Blackhawk.
[time=1626] I don't want you to limit this discussion in your mind to the fact that you teach a Sunday school class or that you help in a wanna, or that you are a deacon in our church.
[time=1636] You see, the ministry Paul's talking about here was his entire life.
[time=1639] It was his vocation, it was everything he was.
[time=1643] And the principles that he gives us apply in the same way to your whole life.
[time=1648] Do you realize that God has called you and equipped you for the life that he is leading you to?
[time=1654] To be married to that particular person, to be working in that particular place, to be living in this particular city, all of that is what is encompassed in God's ministry and your service for him.
[time=1664] It's not some small little compartment called what I do at Blackhawk on Sunday morning.
[time=1668] You are uniquely fitted and designed to be who you are in your community, in your job, with your family, without your family as a single person.
[time=1677] However God has got it, that is his unique dimension of ministry for you.
[time=1683] And he's called you to him.
[time=1684] Didn't do it visibly.
[time=1687] Now here's the exciting thing.
[time=1689] As you discover this, and some of you are well ahead of us than others, but for those of you who may be starting out, as you discover this sense of calling and you discover that God has equipped you for this.
[time=1700] Four things happen, let me highlight them for you.
[time=1703] Number one, you discover that you, as a human being, that you have something to offer, that God has endowed you.
[time=1712] God has given you substance.
[time=1716] God has given you value by virtue of these spiritual gifts and this process of indwelling you with his spirit.
[time=1724] Can we live in a day where people are such desperate need of a strong self-image that is built on something other than the car they drive, the clothes they wear, the house in which they live, the position they happen to hold, such fleeting issues for self-esteem?
[time=1742] The Bible reveals to us that there is a real, genuine sense of self-esteem and a wholeness that a person can stand up and say, "I have been gifted by God.
[time=1753] "I am endowed by the living creator "for certain things which he has in mind for me to do." There, my friends, is a basis for true sense of self-worth.
[time=1763] The second thing that will be discovered is that what I am and what I have to offer can make a real difference in someone else's life.
[time=1774] I mean, I, by the Spirit of God and these gifts, I can really make a difference of substantial proportion and eternal significance in another person's life.
[time=1783] Boy, is that an exhilaration?
[time=1785] The third thing that is discovered is that I not only made someone of substance and that my substance can positively and eternally impact another individual, but that I am not doing this alone.
[time=1801] I am, in fact, inextricably bound and in an organic unity with other believers as we are baptized into the body of Christ, I am with others in this cause.
[time=1811] And what I could never do by myself, I can do with others.
[time=1817] What I may never add up to individually, I will add up to more than that because I am bound in the body of Christ together with others in that same cause.
[time=1827] And then fourthly, one discovers that I am attached to the greatest cause of all time.
[time=1834] There is no greater cause.
[time=1837] Think of it, then, being a part of saving people's souls from hell and reuniting them into a loving, peaceful, joyous relationship with Christ.
[time=1848] There is no greater cause.
[time=1849] I was sitting in my office trying to think of subordinate causes and I didn't want to get in trouble politically so I can't use one of those and I didn't want to get in trouble with the environment so I can't use one of those.
[time=1858] I came up with knitting.
[time=1859] Okay, there it is.
[time=1862] Okay, there's a great cause.
[time=1863] You know, the world's on hard times these days.
[time=1865] America, it isn't knitting like it used to and we've got to do something about this.
[time=1870] Hey, join me in my cause to rekindle knitting in the United States of America.
[time=1875] What a cause.
[time=1877] I mean, it's pointless.
[time=1879] I would suggest to you that almost any other cause that you hold up as noble as it may seem when it comparison to the glory and the wonder of reconciliation and redemption, it sounds almost as inane as knitting does.
[time=1896] My friends, we are tied to the cause of causes and we are placed there by the sovereignty of God.
[time=1904] Your ministry, your life, your vocation is God's ministry for you.
[time=1913] He has equipped you and endowed you.
[time=1915] Oh, that's exciting.
[time=1918] Number two, number two.
[time=1921] The spirit of the ministry is joy.
[time=1928] Look at verse 24.
[time=1929] He says, now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of his body, which is the church.
[time=1938] In filling up that which is lacking in Christ's affliction.
[time=1942] This is an absolutely amazing statement.
[time=1945] The man is full of joy and I have no earthly explanation for his joy, nor does he.
[time=1951] He is at this time imprisoned in Rome.
[time=1953] He is imprisoned in Rome because he has been faithfully telling people about Jesus all over Asia Minor and this false religious group has followed him from city to city to city and in the process he's been lynched, he's been mobbed, he's been stoned, he's been cursed and he won't stop because that's his mandate and neither will they and so he eventually has to appeal to the highest court in the land which is Rome itself where he currently is.
[time=1976] He's incarcerated, but he's joined.
[time=1978] He lists his struggles in second Corinthians 11 at least a partial list.
[time=1983] He says, I've been stoned three times and beaten more times than I can remember.
[time=1987] Now think of that.
[time=1987] I have been beaten, I can't remember how many times, was it 12 or 30, I lost count.
[time=1992] He says, I've been in dangers from the Jews, from the Gentiles, from false prophets and from robbers.
[time=1998] I've been in danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger on the sea and danger in the river.
[time=2004] I've gone without sleep, without food and without water and been exposed to the cold, but I'm joyous.
[time=2012] And you say, oh, I know why he's joyous.
[time=2015] Oh sure, some of those things have been hard, but man, he is the guy in the New Testament.
[time=2020] I mean, he is the founding father.
[time=2022] I mean, he is a legend in his own day, not true.
[time=2026] I mean, it is true that he's a legend and it is true that he's the founding guy and it is true that we can look to him but he never knew that.
[time=2031] He had no concept, the magnitude or the stature of his own work.
[time=2036] When he looked around at the product of his work, all he saw were fledgling, struggling little churches through Asia Minor and all of them had problems.
[time=2045] All of them had problems, they weren't established, they were not with given good leadership, they were in question of, oh, I listed a few here.
[time=2054] They had a lack of love, they were in disunity, they were in doctrinal error, there was incest, there was a violation of communion, there was legalism, there was a perversion of the gospel, there were pastors and elders wanting to quit, there were Christians failing to comprehend who they were in Christ and therefore to live truly transformed lives, they took their spiritual gifts and reversed them instead of being for other people, made them an issue of personal pride.
[time=2076] That's all he saw.
[time=2078] When he looked over the horizon of his life's work, he saw that, joy, spirit of the ministry's joy, how come?
[time=2088] Well look at verse 24, there's two reasons, this is amazing.
[time=2091] This kind of stuff you can take to the bank.
[time=2094] Verse 24, now I rejoice in my sufferings, number one, for your sake, for your sake.
[time=2101] He says, yeah, I'm suffering and I don't pretend I'm not suffering, I'm suffering.
[time=2105] But you know why I'm suffering, I'm suffering for your sake and that causes me joy.
[time=2109] The man is so broken over his own unworthiness, his own sinfulness, he is so convinced of the reality of heaven and he is so freed from living for himself that he is engaged in this wonderful process of living for other people which produces joy in the sacrificial servant.
[time=2128] We live in a day which is all about ourselves, it is all about what we get and establishing our rights and self-actualizing and making sure we get the stuff that we think we need to be to be whole.
[time=2138] And we are maybe the most unhappy society who has ever lived, the most entertained no doubt, but maybe the most unhappy.
[time=2145] And it may be that we have missed fundamentally this point in scriptural truth that you are happiest when you are living for other people.
[time=2152] He says, yeah, I rejoice because I have tapped into the spiritual dynamic which was modeled by Christ whereby joy is found in giving your life away for others.
[time=2164] Second reason he says, verse 24.
[time=2167] In my flesh, I do my share on behalf of his body which is the church, now watch this.
[time=2174] In filling up that which is lacking in Christ's affliction.
[time=2178] Something is lacking.
[time=2179] Well, let me tell you one thing.
[time=2181] That does not mean that the sacrifice of Christ on the cross left anything to be desired as it atoned for sin.
[time=2189] The atonement of Christ in the cross was complete.
[time=2192] In other words, there is nothing left to be added as he appeased the wrath of God for our sin.
[time=2199] There's nothing in that sense lacking in the afflictions of Christ.
[time=2201] What does he mean?
[time=2202] He means this.
[time=2204] When I move around Asia Minor, I don't say my story.
[time=2208] I don't have my program.
[time=2210] I'm not talking about my cause.
[time=2211] I'm talking about Christ and the cause of Christ and salvation.
[time=2215] And when people hear that, they get really mad.
[time=2218] Some of them, some of them get saved.
[time=2220] Some of them just get flat out upset.
[time=2223] And if Christ were here telling them this, they would do to him what they already did to him.
[time=2229] They would beat and mock and scourge and crucify him.
[time=2232] But he's not here right now.
[time=2234] I am.
[time=2235] And so I take the blows they would otherwise have given to Christ.
[time=2239] He says, man, it's such an honor.
[time=2241] It is such an honor and a privilege to be able to stand in the place of Christ and take the blows they would give to him, but because he's not here, I stand in and take them on his behalf.
[time=2253] It's like, you know, those people who can't show up for the Academy Awards.
[time=2256] And so a dear friend comes on their behalf.
[time=2259] Only in this case, it's not to take a beating, it's to take an award.
[time=2262] And they say, you know, so-and-so wish you could be here.
[time=2264] And I'm privileged to stand here on their behalf and take this great award and they walk off the stage.
[time=2268] Same thing.
[time=2269] You and I are given the honor and the privilege because of our close relationship with Christ and that we have so identified with who he is and what he stood for and what he hopes to be to the people we're trying to reach that we stand there at the rostrum, receiving not awards, but suffering and affliction.
[time=2285] And Paul says, man, it fires me up.
[time=2288] It's a source of tremendous joy in my life that I have been counted worthy to stand and receive what they would have otherwise given to Christ.
[time=2299] Number three, number three.
[time=2302] So number two, the spirit of the ministry is joy.
[time=2304] Number three, the staying power of the ministry.
[time=2308] And this is really important.
[time=2309] The staying power of the ministry is focus.
[time=2312] Look at verse 25.
[time=2313] Of this church, I was made a minister according to the stewardship from God bestowed on me for your benefit.
[time=2320] You already covered that, right?
[time=2321] He didn't pick that for himself.
[time=2322] God picked that for him.
[time=2323] Now here's what he's got to do.
[time=2325] That I might fully carry out the preaching of the word of God.
[time=2330] Man, he says, I am not confused as to what God wants to do with my life.
[time=2337] I know exactly what God has called me to do and the only thing that matters to me is fully carrying out the preaching of the word of God.
[time=2346] He refused to be distracted.
[time=2347] He refused to be sidetracked or redirected or taken off course or discouraged at the point of quitting.
[time=2353] I mean, it was just like a bulldog.
[time=2355] I mean, he had his tight grip on this reality and nothing was going to shake him off this thing.
[time=2360] I will finish my course.
[time=2363] I will finish the course that God has given me.
[time=2366] Now the blessing in all this, the last book there that he wrote, Second Timothy.
[time=2372] You don't have to turn there.
[time=2373] Second Timothy four, six and seven, he says this.
[time=2376] I have, he's just, this is it.
[time=2377] This is the last thing he's going to say.
[time=2379] I have fought the good fight.
[time=2381] I have finished the course.
[time=2383] I have kept the faith.
[time=2385] Man, that's exciting.
[time=2387] He did it.
[time=2387] He faithfully persevered.
[time=2390] He carried out the preaching of the word of God until the end.
[time=2394] One of the men in this church who has had a huge impact on my life as I have watched him and his family.
[time=2401] He's got a theme that runs in his view of the church and ministry and it's this.
[time=2405] I am going to be found faithful.
[time=2410] And he always says, and I may not have any significant accomplishments along the way, but there'll be one thing that's true about me when it's all said and done.
[time=2418] I will have done my job.
[time=2420] I will have finished my course.
[time=2422] Wow, that's exciting.
[time=2424] Now you say, well, he's talking about preaching the word
[time=2430] of God, I'm not a preacher.
[time=2431] You're saying to yourself, I'm not a preacher.
[time=2432] Yeah, it's true.
[time=2433] What is your life calling?
[time=2434] Finish it.
[time=2436] Stay married to that husband or that wife where there are not grounds for biblical divorce.
[time=2442] Finish that course.
[time=2443] That is God's calling for your life and he will empower you to do it and refine you in the process as hard and as ridiculous as that may seem.
[time=2452] Stay the course.
[time=2453] Continue to love your children even when they are unlovable and they do things that make you want to get away from them.
[time=2459] Stay in there.
[time=2461] Finish that course.
[time=2462] Be the loving, gracious, compassionate parent that God has called you to be.
[time=2466] Don't walk out on your job or your employer.
[time=2471] Refuse to do that under unethical terms.
[time=2474] Stay in there and uphold the reputation of Christ.
[time=2477] And when it is appropriate if such change is desirable and other Lord, then make that change, but don't be a quitter.
[time=2484] Don't dishonor the word of God.
[time=2485] And by the way, if you are teaching a Sunday school here
[time=2491] at the church, go ahead and keep doing that too.
[time=2494] Be faithful to those responsibilities.
[time=2496] Be on time.
[time=2497] Be prepared.
[time=2499] That is a part of your ministry and please finish your course for the glory of God.
[time=2503] So he says the staying power of the ministry is focus.
[time=2508] Listen, I'll tell you this.
[time=2509] I'm with this other elder.
[time=2510] I don't expect ever to be given some massive award for some significant accomplishment that I might have made.
[time=2517] I don't ever think that I'm the person that's gonna be writing books that everybody reads and preaching messages that everybody listens to and there's nothing wrong with that.
[time=2524] I just don't see that in my future.
[time=2525] I don't see great recognition and great feats.
[time=2529] You know what I see?
[time=2530] In fact, this is made, this may be the case.
[time=2531] The greatest accomplishment of my life may be that I just stay in the ministry my whole life.
[time=2537] That may be your greatest accomplishment too.
[time=2540] And what an accomplishment it is.
[time=2542] It gave me a task and I finished.
[time=2547] He set the course and I ran it all the way.
[time=2553] Principal number four, principal number four, the subject of the ministry, Christ in you.
[time=2562] You say, what are we about?
[time=2564] What's the message?
[time=2565] What are we talking about?
[time=2566] What's he preaching about?
[time=2567] What is this?
[time=2568] Okay, we're in the ministry and we're gonna be faithful to it, but what are we, what is it about?
[time=2572] Look at verse 26, talks about the mystery.
[time=2575] That's something, as it says in verse 26, that was hidden from the past.
[time=2579] Ages and generations means times and groups of people.
[time=2582] What has now been manifested to his saints.
[time=2585] That's us, that's today.
[time=2586] We get to know the mystery.
[time=2588] Verse 27, to whom God will to make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the Gentiles?
[time=2594] Well, what is the mystery that we get to know that other people didn't get to know?
[time=2597] Excuse me.
[time=2600] It is at the end of verse 27, Christ in you, the mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[time=2608] I am so thankful that next week when these friends of ours come and we try to lift up the core reality of what we are, we are not saying to them, do better.
[time=2620] Be more moral.
[time=2621] Stop doing so many bad things.
[time=2623] Try harder and maybe when all is said and done, you just might make it into the presence of God.
[time=2630] You know our messages?
[time=2634] God is desiring to take residence in your life right now.
[time=2639] And he's made the provision for it.
[time=2640] He's forgiven.
[time=2641] He has the capacity to forgive all your sins and the culminating reality.
[time=2645] It's Christ in you.
[time=2647] He will take residence in your heart and your life and then become the hope of your glory.
[time=2651] He is the object of glory.
[time=2653] He is the thing to which we long to be in His presence.
[time=2657] Ephesians 3, 17 says that Christ dwells in our hearts through faith.
[time=2662] The Lord said in John 656, He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood, abides in me and I in Him.
[time=2672] Now he doesn't literally mean eating body parts and drinking literal blood.
[time=2676] He's talking about participating in the death and resurrection.
[time=2680] When you will eat, when you will take unto yourself my death and resurrection, I will abide in you.
[time=2688] John 14, 23, if anyone loves me, the Lord says.
[time=2693] He will keep my word, now watch, and my Father will love Him and we will come to Him and make our abode in Him.
[time=2703] Man, that's amazing.
[time=2706] That speaks of intimacy and communion and relationship and God from the fall has been seeking to restore that level of intimacy with His people.
[time=2716] That's what the tabernacle was about in the Old Testament.
[time=2718] But now the New Testament says when we come to Christ, we are the tabernacle of God.
[time=2724] We can live immediately and directly in us.
[time=2726] That is the subject of our ministry and wherever you are, whatever you're doing, that is the reality that we live and that we proclaim and that we lift up.
[time=2737] Number five, principle number five.
[time=2742] What is the style of the ministry?
[time=2746] I mean, how do we do it?
[time=2747] How do we get the job done?
[time=2751] What's the procedure?
[time=2754] Look at verse 28 there.
[time=2755] It says we proclaim Him.
[time=2758] We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom that we may present every man completing Christ.
[time=2766] The style of the ministry is to proclaim Christ.
[time=2768] We need to lift Him up.
[time=2770] We need to lift Him up so the unbeliever can see Him through our life, through our behavior.
[time=2775] It says over there in 1 Peter 2, just in case you think that the proclaiming thing is only for the apostle or only for the preacher or only for the elder, it's truly for everyone.
[time=2785] It says over there in 1 Peter 2 that we have in fact been, it is our responsibility to proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called us out of darkness into the kingdom of His beloved Son.
[time=2797] That's all of our jobs.
[time=2799] We are all in the process of lifting and proclaiming Christ up.
[time=2803] He does use two words there in verse 28, admonishing which means to encourage someone to do right in light of the reality of sin and the consequences of sin, to admonish someone is to warn them if you pursue on this path, sin will have its way and you will have to suffer the consequences of sin.
[time=2821] The word teaching means to communicate truth, doctrine.
[time=2824] And you've done that.
[time=2825] You've corrected people's understanding about God.
[time=2827] You've shared with them about the reality of the love of Christ and the person of Christ.
[time=2831] You can do that formally behind a pulpit or you can do that through the course of your life.
[time=2835] We're all to be in the process of lifting Christ up, admonishing warning people against sin and instructing them in the truth about Christ.
[time=2843] Turn over a page, if you would then, to chapter three, verse 16.
[time=2848] Again, this is not something that only a few of us do.
[time=2851] Colossians three, 16 says, let the word of Christ richly dwell within you with all wisdom.
[time=2859] Here it is, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
[time=2868] You see that?
[time=2869] That's a general responsibility of all the believers.
[time=2872] We're all to be in the process of teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns.
[time=2878] Okay, back to Colossians one.
[time=2880] The style of the ministry.
[time=2883] You can't escape the fact, however, in this verse that we do need to open our mouths.
[time=2889] I mean, we need to declare this open our mouth weak for the cause of Christ.
[time=2895] And in our context, in our day, invite people to relationship with you, to this outreach service, open your mouth about the things of God.
[time=2905] Okay, principle number six.
[time=2911] The sum of the ministry.
[time=2914] What does it all add up to?
[time=2917] What does it culminate in?
[time=2918] The end of verse 28 says that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[time=2925] I'm quite confident I do not understand the fullness, nor am I able to express the reality of what it would mean to be complete in Christ.
[time=2935] Completely forgiven, completely restored, completely made holy and blameless and beyond approach.
[time=2943] I mean, to be complete in Christ, that is it.
[time=2946] To be Christ-like, to have everything in when I look completely like Christ and when you look completely like Christ and when the folks, we would win to Christ look completely like Christ.
[time=2956] That is the sum of the ministry.
[time=2958] What amazes me about this is that it says every man.
[time=2962] Every man completing Christ.
[time=2964] There are no racial boundaries.
[time=2968] That means that the Japanese person and the Chinese person and the person who lives in Africa and India and Russia and the Ukraine, I mean everybody.
[time=2976] This just puts its arms around every single human being who potentially could come to Christ and end up looking like Christ, being complete in Him.
[time=2987] It reinforces the notion that our ministry is not about buildings, it is not about programs, it's not about budgets, it's about people who would become complete.
[time=2999] What does that look like?
[time=3001] They look like Christ.
[time=3002] Well, number seven here.
[time=3009] The strength of the ministry is divine power.
[time=3014] Look at verse 29.
[time=3017] He says, "For the purpose of presenting "every man completing Christ, I also labor and strive." The word labor means to work yourself to the point of exhaustion.
[time=3029] And there are different words for labor in the New Testament and this one is the one that describes the exhausting kind of work where you've just gone at it and at it and at it can tell your personal resources are dwindled and you literally are exhausted.
[time=3041] It's time to get a drink, sit down, take a rest, come back tomorrow, I'm done.
[time=3045] I've worked myself to exhaustion.
[time=3047] The word striving comes from the athletic world, Aganizo, and it means to struggle against setbacks and opposition.
[time=3057] And maybe the athletic endeavor which in my mind combines these two concepts most completely is wrestling.
[time=3064] I mean in three minutes of wrestling you can completely exhaust all your personal resources.
[time=3070] And in that little circle you are doing everything you can to overcome the setbacks of that opposition and his moves and what he does.
[time=3078] It's just a face to face intimate struggle to gain the victory that leaves you completely exhausted.
[time=3085] That's what he's saying.
[time=3086] That's how we are to approach the ministry.
[time=3089] And you know what happens if you do that?
[time=3092] I mean if you give yourself like that to the point of exhaustion and you struggle against it, you know what happens?
[time=3097] Absolutely nothing.
[time=3098] Absolutely nothing until God shows up.
[time=3102] Look at the rest of the verse.
[time=3105] "For this purpose also I labor striving according to his power which mightily works within me." Boy man this has been the year for Russell Moore to learn this in new and meaningful ways.
[time=3118] In personal discipleship relationships and as we stand corporately together as a church there has been a laboring and a striving and a seeking to accomplish the work of God and at points nothing occurring.
[time=3132] Maybe even negative things occurring.
[time=3134] And without me changing what I'm trying to do with the type of labor, the type of striving all of a sudden God shows up and things are different.
[time=3142] It's amazing.
[time=3145] I think of one relationship with an individual where I plead and I understand the person's life and I go into the situation and try to exhort and teach and admonish and persuade, live differently, live for God and for months nothing happens.
[time=3159] Then God shows up and suddenly out of their own heart, out of their own convictions they begin to articulate truth of repentance and change and values are different than behavior and there's no explaining it.
[time=3173] There's just no same as true of our church.
[time=3176] All of a sudden God decides to go.
[time=3179] Things start happening and the blessing in both of those dimensions is this.
[time=3184] You just can't take any credit and you get the privilege of seeing God's hand.
[time=3190] You know, you look in the Old Testament whoa, I'd love to see God part the Red Sea.
[time=3194] Get involved trying to change people's lives.
[time=3197] Give yourself totally and completely to it and realize they won't change on your power and then wait around and pray for the power of God and then watch him change and you go, uh-oh, Red Sea just parted.
[time=3207] That was cool.
[time=3209] That's what he means.
[time=3211] The strength of the ministry is the divine power of God himself.
[time=3215] You've heard that little phrase.
[time=3216] You gotta pray like it all depends upon you.
[time=3219] Excuse me, you gotta work like it all depends upon you and pray like it all depends upon God.
[time=3223] That's probably one of the verses from which that little slogan came, it's very true.
[time=3228] You gotta work like a mad dog.
[time=3230] Like it all depends upon you.
[time=3232] But pray and really understand that it really does all depend upon God.
[time=3239] One conclusion then, let me give you these seven points.
[time=3242] Principles for ministry, principles to live by.
[time=3247] Number one, the source of the ministry is God.
[time=3250] Two, the spirit of the ministry is joy.
[time=3254] Three, the staying power of the ministry is focus.
[time=3257] Four, the subject of the ministry is Christ.
[time=3261] Four, five, the style of the ministry is proclamation.
[time=3264] Six, the sum of the ministry is Christ like this.
[time=3268] And seven, the strength of the ministry is God.
[time=3272] Well, I trust that as you look at these things,
[time=3278] examine your life, they'll either be great guiding lights to you as you embark in ministry, or as you are somewhere mid-course, they remind you of things you really believe are true.
[time=3290] And you go away saying, that's true.
[time=3292] The Bible is right and that's what I want to mark my life.
[time=3297] And if there is a point or two in that list where you have become weak, or you have begun to stray, my friend, this is the opportunity to deal with that before the Lord and stay on track.
[time=3308] Let's pray together.
[time=3310] Father, we're so thankful to come into this place and be minister to just the way the whole service is gone, the music that's pointed our focus and the direction of service, and then these testimonies from our elders, and then the truth that comes from Paul's life.
[time=3328] Thank you, Lord, for the recharging of the batteries and for the encouragement and for the direction.
[time=3334] We praise you and we acknowledge you as the one to be worshiped for these good and marvelous things.
[time=3339] We love you and we praise you.
[time=3342] We pray these things in Christ's name.
[time=3344] [AMEN] (gentle music)
[time=3355] (gentle music) - Well, as you listen to those seven principles for ministry and really for life, maybe you see something there that you wish you had in your life, those are kind of noble ideals for which to live.
[time=3371] And maybe as you look at your own life, you find that it's just no more than getting up, going to work to earn money, to pay bills that still are left unpaid when you're done with all you've made that month.
[time=3385] You know, life short of living it for the purposes of God can become incredibly monotonous.
[time=3391] It can become pointless.
[time=3393] It can lack a real sense of purpose.
[time=3395] And all kinds of problems can occur in a person's life if all they're living for is the next paycheck and the next work day so they can kind of make it through the next set of bills.
[time=3407] It's true that when you come to Christ, you are given real purpose and real meaning to live for things which are bigger and even more important than yourself.
[time=3415] And there comes the energy and the life from which to live.
[time=3420] It all begins with a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3423] And if you're interested in having Him as your Savior so that you can have this kind of purpose in your life, I invite you to bow your head with me in just a moment.
[time=3430] I'm gonna pray out loud a prayer that if you pray in your own heart, God'll hear it and God'll respond and He'll save you and send Christ into your life.
[time=3439] Christ in you, the hope of glory as it's set in the text and you'll be on your road, on a new road to life in Christ.
[time=3446] I invite you to pray with me now.
[time=3447] Father, I know that I am a sinner and that I have violated your law, that I deserve punishment for what I've done, but I understand and believe that Christ has come, the Son of God to live and to die on my sins, to take my sins upon Himself and pay the penalty for my sin and I pray to receive Him into my heart to be my Savior.
[time=3470] Thank you, Father, for hearing my prayer and I pray these things in Jesus' name.
[time=3475] [AMEN] Well, if you just prayed that prayer, we'd love to hear from you here at the Bible Hour, send you some material to get you on your way.
