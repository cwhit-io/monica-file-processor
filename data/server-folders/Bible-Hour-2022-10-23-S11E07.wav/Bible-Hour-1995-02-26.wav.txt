[time=0] Meg Greenfield wrote a series of articles in Newsweek magazine some time ago.
[time=7] One of them was entitled, "Why nothing is wrong anymore." In that article she observed that people in our day will sometimes grudgingly admit to doing something stupid, grudgingly admit to doing something ill-advised, sometimes people
[time=23] will even express deep regret at having exercised poor judgment. But, Meg Greenfield goes on
[time=30] to contend, "People almost refuse to say, 'I did wrong.'"
[time=40] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church. We're glad you've joined us. How do you explain the brutal treatment human beings deal out to each other these days?
[time=51] It seems every time we turn on the news, we're exposed to a new level of senseless violence that takes us deeper into the reality of how badly people are capable of treating each other. As shocked as we are at this behavior, we seem unable to call it what it is - sin.
[time=69] The notion of personal sin has all but vanished in America today, but there is a price to be paid for failing to admit personal responsibility for our sin.
[time=78] We'll stay with us today as Pastor Moore discusses the pros and cons of a no-fault society.
[time=108] You can't get enough of a thrill, though it slowly destroys you. You go back to it still.
[time=128] You say you want a way out, but if you can find it, you have your doubts. He will deliver you.
[time=155] My God knows what he does. He will deliver you.
[time=168] His power will change and make you new. Just give him your life. Let him bring you through.
[time=188] My God will deliver you.
[time=204] Are you fearing the future? You can't always sleep that night.
[time=217] The hands of past seem to haunt you. You think is there more to life? You say you want a way out.
[time=241] My God delivers. I have no doubt. He will deliver you.
[time=255] My God knows what he does. He will deliver you.
[time=269] My power will change and make you new. Just give him your life. Let him bring you through.
[time=290] My God will deliver.
[time=298] He will deliver.
[time=303] My God will deliver you.
[time=314] He will deliver you.
[time=321] My God knows what he does. He will deliver you.
[time=332] My power will change and make you new.
[time=342] Just give him your life. Let him bring you through.
[time=353] My God will deliver.
[time=395] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to thank you for joining us on the Bible Hour
[time=417] today.
[time=418] We're excited about some things that are coming up. I just kind of like to share them with you. The first is a concert with Steve Green on April 13th at 7.30 in the evening.
[time=427] That will be here at Blackhawk Baptist Church and you're all invited to come and be a part of this wonderful time. Steve is a strong Godly Christian, tremendous upbringing by his missionary
[time=437] parents and just a tremendously Godly individual and we're blessed not only by his vocal talent
[time=443] but by his heart and his commitment to the Lord and we would love for you to join us for a wonderful evening of worship with Steve Green. That's April 13th at 7.30. You can get your tickets for that through any of the local Christian bookstores or you can buy tickets here at Blackhawk Baptist Church whichever you prefer. The tickets will go on sale March 6th.
[time=462] So please plan to join us. It will be a great time. Bring your family, bring your friends and anticipate a tremendous time of worship with Steve Green.
[time=472] The other thing we're excited to tell you about is that we wanted to be able to send you a new little booklet that's out. It's called "God's Promises for Your Encouragement." And this is a tremendous little asset, little tool to have. I have one that's just like it, not this exact one. But what it does is it breaks down various issues in your Christian life by
[time=493] category and then lists off scriptures that are all about that particular category whether it be
[time=500] hope or mercy or healing or deliverance or people and when you're struggling with a particular
[time=506] issue in your life there's a need and you wouldn't know just exactly where to go in your Bible.
[time=511] This is kind of a topical index and it's a handy reference and each particular topical have between 15 to 30 different scriptures just laid out right there for you. You read through it
[time=522] and it's amazing the difference of course that God's Word can make in your life as you ponder on it, meditate on it, read it and just allow the Spirit of God to move inside your heart
[time=534] and inside your life. The Bible is living and it's active and it's sharper than a two-edged sword.
[time=539] The Bible calls itself all those things and that's because it is different than just the normal writing of a mere human being. Of course because the Word of God is inspired by the Spirit of God when you take it and you read it and apply it to a particular issue in your life it does make a difference and we'd love to send that to you absolutely free of charge, tremendous little tool for your spiritual growth. Well as we anticipate today's program I just want you to know that it is
[time=566] all about becoming a Christian. It addresses the issue of personal sin and even though our
[time=572] society has a lot of trouble admitting to that we always want to call it something other than personal sin. Oftentimes we'll blame it on other people or we'll excuse our behavior, we'll try to find reasons why we did it and therefore the reasons we shouldn't be held accountable for
[time=587] it. We just have a terrible phobia I guess about admitting our personal sin and that we are guilty
[time=593] before God but the message is one of hope. It's one of a tremendous resolution of that problem that
[time=600] we have with each other and with God and how we can be healed and forgiven forever through the person of Jesus Christ and so I don't know how you're feeling about your life today. I don't know if you're wondering about that very issue in your life maybe you've done some things here in the last week or two or even the month or even the year and you'll look at them and you go my I'm embarrassed
[time=620] of myself. I can't believe I've done these kinds of things maybe you're hoping that certain people
[time=626] will never find out what you've done. If that is at all kind of the thoughts that are going through your head I think today's message is for you. It's a message of hope, a message of forgiveness, a message of encouragement so stay with us, won't you?
[time=650] I cannot hide from God. However I may try, the mountains cover me.
[time=663] I'll not escape his eye. I've wandered far and near and still his voice I hear.
[time=676] I know that I can never hide from God. I cannot hide from the dear Lord to escape
[time=693] thee so often I've tried. No rest will I know while here be low till in Christ my soul shall hide.
[time=723] [MUSIC]
[time=750] How often in the past I've gone my separate way. I knew I'd come at last to face another day.
[time=765] When for my wasted years I'd pay in grief and tears. I knew that I could never hide from
[time=780] God. I cannot hide from the dear Lord to escape thee so often I've tried. No rest will I know
[time=804] while here be low till in Christ my soul shall hide.
[time=834] All I can say is I can relate. I hate it when I am doing something wrong and I get caught.
[time=849] I am a newcomer to Fort Wayne and so I had to find out the hard way that there's a speed trap
[time=856] on your way home from Chicago just as you go by Warsaw. So there it was late Saturday night we'd
[time=864] stayed a little longer than we planned. I was very tired driving a little faster than maybe I should
[time=870] have on the way home. Coming right there into Warsaw when suddenly I saw that dreaded sight in the rearview mirror flashing lights and I'm thinking to myself oh please let those be for
[time=881] someone else you know. Drive on by my friend, drive on by. No such luck just sat right on my tail
[time=888] finally I had to admit the obvious and pull over and as I'm pulling over I'm thinking how do I get out of this what do I tell this guy I hate getting caught I don't want to admit this. There's gotta be an escape out of this thing and I looked at my wife and she was sound asleep so I knew that excuse wouldn't work. I mean it wasn't as if she'd aggravated me we were in some negative argument.
[time=908] I thought about the possibility of all a medical emergency at home or something that just required my getting home and that wouldn't work and I couldn't tell him the truth. I mean how do you say well officer it is a little late here Saturday night and I'm trying to get home I'm trying to go
[time=923] to bed because I'm a preacher and I have to get up early tomorrow morning. No no you don't say that
[time=931] so I had that sinking feeling okay this time justice will be done there is no where to run
[time=939] there is no way out it's my fault. Well Meg Grinfield is suggesting that this strong desire not to have
[time=950] to say it's my fault runs not only I guess deep in my heart but across the country she wrote a series of articles in Newsweek magazine some time ago. One of the articles once was entitled quote
[time=962] why nothing is wrong anymore in quote in the article she observed that people in our day will
[time=969] sometimes grudgingly admit to doing something stupid grudgingly admit to doing something ill-advised
[time=977] sometimes people will even express deep regret at having exercised poor judgment but Meg goes on to
[time=985] say why people have such a hard time saying quote I did wrong or in the context of our theme this
[time=993] morning why do people have such a hard time saying it's my fault. Well apparently this understanding
[time=1005] and this desire not to have to say that is finding its way even into the courtrooms of America where
[time=1011] they are in fact in the business of finding fault I mean that's what justice is all about
[time=1017] we're supposed to be able to go there stand before a jury of our peers the evidence is supposed to be presented and we are either innocent or guilty and it's either our fault or it is in our fault
[time=1028] but apparently we're having trouble with that in our well it's not my fault that's what a city
[time=1034] supervisor who worked for the city of San Francisco said there was no question that he had murdered
[time=1040] a fellow city supervisor that was not debated there was no question that he had murdered the
[time=1046] then mayor Moscone that fact was undisputed the issue was why and so he said it's not my fault
[time=1055] because I had catch it too much junk food particularly Twinkies the man actually said this to a jury in
[time=1062] California of all places and so the famous Twinkie defense was born quote a lenient jury
[time=1072] bought the line and produced a verdict of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder end quote they ruled that the junk food resulted in quote diminished mental capacity
[time=1084] in quote which mitigated the killer's guilt he was out of prison before the next term of Mayor
[time=1091] Moscone's uh mayor ship would have been complete it's not my fault that's what a New York City drug
[time=1099] dealer and cocaine addict said in a court of law there was no disputing the fact that he had at
[time=1105] point blank range executed eight children and two women that was not the problem there was no
[time=1112] difficulty proving that the jurors decided that drugs and stress quote were a reasonable
[time=1120] explanation for his actions they said the man had acted under extreme emotional distress and the
[time=1126] influence of drugs in quote so they found him guilty on a lesser charge that brought only a light
[time=1132] sentence not my fault so said Musa Hanuki a Los Angeles businessman
[time=1141] who took a pipe wrench and beat his wife to death he went into the courtroom and said it's not my fault
[time=1151] because I have been the subject of 25 years of wife battering and my religious beliefs don't
[time=1159] allow me to get a divorce i.e. I had no other option but to murder her the jury bought it
[time=1167] and gave him four and a half years in prison and then he was out
[time=1173] why do we do that why is it so incredibly hard both for us as individuals and now as a society
[time=1187] to stand up take responsibility for our actions and say it's my fault I did it I'm the one to blame
[time=1196] well let me give you a couple of explanations I think that came to my mind as I was thinking this through one reason why I think we don't want to say it's my fault is because there are
[time=1208] consequences associated with such an admission of guilt if for example you are working for a
[time=1214] company and the situation arises and you admit that it is your fault that a package was shipped
[time=1220] to the wrong address think of the consequences you could be fired you could lose your job you could
[time=1226] have a demotion you could have your pay docked all kinds of problems in other words it's just a
[time=1233] whole lot easier when something has quote unquote gone wrong that you might have done to just try to leave the impression that it just went wrong and if the fingers start coming in your direction to point to somebody else why don't want to suffer the consequences I understand that another reason
[time=1251] that came to my mind people don't want to say it's my fault because they fear rejection and the scorn
[time=1257] of their peers same said worker if he admits that it is his fault or her fault that the package
[time=1264] was shipped to the wrong address there may be a certain sense if it was a really important package
[time=1270] that damaged the company a sense of shame or a sense of a reputation that that person might get
[time=1277] as the one who missed shipped the package wrong address Mary she might get as a nickname she might become the brunt of all the jokes that's on a minor thing like a package suppose a person working in
[time=1288] a in a company with others actually stole from the pension fund and suddenly there was no retirement
[time=1295] money because that person not only stole it but spent it imagine the sense of rejection that the sense of scorn that the person would feel and so rather than stand up and say it's my fault the
[time=1306] pain of that rejection is too intense it's somebody else's fault it's the way I was raised you have
[time=1313] no idea how extreme my circumstances were you realize that one of the strongest needs of the
[time=1320] human heart is to belong to feel accepted in a marriage relationship with a group of friends
[time=1326] on a team in a church in the workplace and that drive to belong can be so strong and the fear of
[time=1335] being rejected by people can be so overpowering that people would rather lie then stand up and say
[time=1343] it's my fault a third reason that I think we don't want to say it's my fault the searching pain
[time=1352] of self judgment in other words most of us already feel bad enough about who we are and what we are
[time=1359] and what we've done already I mean there's a voice that runs in our head that tends to say
[time=1365] we're pretty worthless that we're losers that we don't really have what it takes to make it in life
[time=1372] we look at other people they seem to be doing better or they seem to manage better and we feel that if the truth were known about us if the walls could speak and say the truth about us it's already questionable whether or not we've got what it takes and what we what we really don't need is then to start owning up to the mistakes and the failures and the wrong doings in our life
[time=1393] it's as if that would just keep greater sense of self condemnation upon us there's a lot of pain
[time=1399] associated with that a good friend of mine not too many weeks ago had had done something wrong and
[time=1405] really wanted to get that thing right and wanted to talk to somebody about it and the person came to me and the only word that I can use to describe the image of his face is anguish there was an
[time=1418] anguishing sense of pain of having to say I did it and I and what I did was wrong it's a high motivator
[time=1428] not to say it's my fault there's another one the last one that came to my mind another reason why
[time=1436] people don't want to say it's my fault is because if there is a god I certainly don't want to admit
[time=1444] to him that I've done wrong I mean that's the last place I want to make such an admission
[time=1451] because somehow some way I want god to be able to group me with the the good people
[time=1458] if I go around admitting to him what I've actually done I might get grouped over there with the
[time=1464] Bundies and the Mansons and the Dalmers and I can't I can't stand the thought of being grouped there
[time=1471] so in fact if there is a god rather than be honest with him I would rather try not to admit to him
[time=1479] and to myself what I have actually done in the hopes that somehow I'll get grouped over here on the
[time=1488] good side of the scale if you will so rather than say it's my fault we play games with ourselves
[time=1495] we play games with our sin and we try to explain it away then your bulletin I've listed a few of
[time=1502] those games four of them came to my mind pretty common games that people play if you wanted to follow along there but the first game that came to my mind is called the I call it the alteration
[time=1513] game the alteration game and in this game we recreate god we just make god the way we think
[time=1521] god ought to be we change him into the kind of god we think he ought to be it goes this way quote
[time=1528] my god come judgment day isn't going to condemn anybody because my god is a loving god
[time=1538] or my god would never allow anybody to go to hell he would never chastise one of his children
[time=1544] for committing sin because my god isn't like that the god that I have created the god that I have
[time=1551] altered the god that I have have kind of recreated the way I like him would never do those things
[time=1560] another game you see there is called the the blame game the blame game it goes this way
[time=1566] you would send to if you would send to if you came out of the home that I came from if you live
[time=1575] with the spouse I live with you would do it too if you live with the hurt that I live with every
[time=1585] moment of every day you do it too don't blame me it's not my fault it's amazing isn't it we just
[time=1596] choke on the admission of guilt something in us as humans we just we can barely get it out
[time=1603] well it's another game we play I call it the comparison game the comparison game we have an
[time=1611] uncanny ability to fix our focus on the spectacular sinners in our culture we just zero in on them
[time=1620] and we take a long hard look at them because in comparison to them we must be doing pretty good
[time=1626] never committed a murder never raped anybody never robbed a bank I got to be over here don't I
[time=1635] which allows us not to take an honest look at ourselves keep that focus on people who are really out
[time=1643] of bounds the last game I listed there what I call the denial game the denial game some folks
[time=1652] don't recreate God they just do away with him all together they don't take the time to recreate
[time=1658] and they just say there is no God you see the urge to be out from under the responsibility
[time=1665] of a God can be so strong that sometimes what appears to be the best avenue is just to say
[time=1674] there isn't a God at all presto problem is solved if there's no God there must be no right or wrong
[time=1683] or if there is a sort of a right or wrong it certainly would be one that I could live inside of no murders no rapes no bank robberies so if there's no God then we could have a maybe a reduced
[time=1695] sense of morality and then I don't have to say it's my fault atheists have a vested interest in
[time=1706] keeping God out of the picture because if there is a God with a moral standard then they will have
[time=1712] to stand before him and that my friends is a is a terrifying thought so we humans we will go to
[time=1722] astonishing lengths to shed responsibility for our personal sin will rationalize it will trivialize
[time=1730] it will legalize it will blame others for it anything anything but say it's mine I own it my fault
[time=1739] well as attractive as that is and as prone as I am to want to kind of play those games as I look
[time=1746] at my own life I feel it's only fair to say that there are some pretty steep consequences
[time=1752] for playing in these games in other words and the analogy may work oftentimes game playing is a
[time=1760] non-reality thing and when you escape in your mind into some of those games it feels comfortable I
[time=1767] mean it it might even rationally make a little bit of sense but it doesn't change reality it doesn't change the fact that you and I have done things which are wrong well let me just list a few of the consequences of these of these of playing these games and in
[time=1784] your bulletin I listed it as the costs the costs associated with playing games it's almost as if there's an admission price you have to pay when you get into these kind of games the first one I
[time=1795] list there is called a stained conscience a stained conscience when a person refuses
[time=1803] to own up to their own responsibility for their behavior one of the costs associated with that is a stained conscience listen to one of the old testament
[time=1813] writers talking about what that felt like in his life he said my sin is a heavy burden for me
[time=1822] because of my folly I am beaten over and bowed down I mourn all day long I am numb crushed and I
[time=1830] groaned because of the condition of my heart my strength fails me the light is gone out of my eyes
[time=1837] my loved ones and my friends and my kinsmen stand afar off from me when a person fails to deal honestly with their sin it's like a heavy weight
[time=1850] that gets tied around the neck and instead of honestly dealing with that you got to drag it with you
[time=1857] everywhere you go it puts a cloud of sorts over life itself and some of you know all too well how
[time=1866] agonizing it is to carry that stuff around all the time with you to wonder when will I get found out
[time=1875] when will the knock come on my door when will I receive the letter when will I pick up the phone and answer it and then the information that destroys my image will be told it's an incredible
[time=1890] thing to have to carry around all the time it's a heavy heavy weight for many many of you it has
[time=1897] been so long since you've had a clean conscience before God and before others that you've forgotten
[time=1905] what it's like to wake up in the morning and to feel the cool breeze and to see the colors vividly
[time=1912] and have a sense of joy and excitement about living this next day with a clean conscience in the
[time=1919] presence of God and man authentic in your relationships you can hardly remember that your regular experience
[time=1927] is to wake up in the morning with a sense of dread and maybe you don't fully even understand it but
[time=1934] there's a weight that's in your life the clouds have settled in I can tell you very honestly
[time=1943] that in my life when I fail to deal with my sin honestly with God and honestly with the people
[time=1951] that I may have offended that describes my life there's a dark cloud that settles in and it's heavy
[time=1959] and it's weighty and it robs the joy out of my existence and what I find so curious
[time=1965] nobody has really changed anything in my life I mean I still own the same home that I own
[time=1972] married to the same wife have the same kids drive the same car go to the same job in other
[time=1978] words the big issues in my life didn't change at all but because I refuse to honestly acknowledge
[time=1984] my sin to God and to the person or people I might have offended it's as if there's this cloud that
[time=1990] comes in and it gets really cold and I don't like it it's a heavy thing I carry around
[time=1996] you may assure that experience that's one of the consequences of playing those games we've talked
[time=2003] about refusing to come clean well another one of the consequences another one of the admission
[time=2014] prices that you have to pay to play these games is what I call the confusion the confusion and few people really think this one through or or even aware of it because it happens so subtly when you
[time=2025] fail when I fail to come clean about my sin it impairs my judgment it impairs my discernment
[time=2034] on moral choices and pretty soon I'm confused and I find that I'm able to make bad decisions
[time=2042] in the moral arena that I wouldn't otherwise have made if I let that stuff hang around in my life
[time=2049] without dealing with it it breeds a certain sort of confusion and I lose the clarity in my moral
[time=2055] choices you might think of it as a moral compass where inside of you inside your heart or your
[time=2062] mind somewhere there's a moral compass there's a sense of what is right and what is wrong
[time=2068] and when we fail to do honest deal honestly with our faults and our short scumbings and our sins it's
[time=2074] as if on that little glass part on the top of that compass some dirty water falls on it and I don't
[time=2082] deal with that sin so it stays there it hardens then I do another one more more dirty water more dirty
[time=2089] water more dirty water and over time I can no longer see through the glass to the compass itself
[time=2097] and so I'm lost and I don't know the moral choices I don't know where true north is anymore
[time=2103] and I'm prone to make some pretty bad decisions without the clear use of that moral compass
[time=2111] it's like Jed Magruder said to Judge Serica during the Watergate trials remember that he said this
[time=2123] quote somewhere along my life's journey I lost my moral compass and with it the ability to navigate
[time=2132] my life little little choices one one choice at a time the moral compass of my life begins to lose
[time=2144] its ability to guide me and I would venture to say there may be many of us here today
[time=2151] who are involved in activities and behaviors today that we would never have been involved in
[time=2159] five years ago and you say to yourself how did I get here what am I doing I never would have
[time=2169] thought I could have made these choices in the moral arena what's happened to me that's exactly what has happened over time the reluctance to deal honestly with sin
[time=2182] blackens over the moral compass and before you know it you're capable of making decisions that
[time=2189] you never otherwise would have made and that's a price to pay a third one a third
[time=2198] cost of playing these games I guess it's just as called the consequences and I mean by that
[time=2205] I mean by that this you know sooner or later the consequences for a particular behavior they
[time=2213] almost always catch up with you I mean that's what we try to teach our kids right you can maybe fool us for a little while you may fool us for a long time but eventually the consequences of
[time=2223] your choices they're going to catch up to you it's like that story about the kids who went off into the forest to collect the berries and some of the kids really were tired and so they had a basket full of berries and they brought them back and and one of the little boys at least as I remember the story he didn't want to do berry picking I mean he was into like playing by the stream and taking a little nap and so suddenly everybody's done and he doesn't want to be left out and so he fills the bottom of his little basket with with straw and hay and leaves and stuff and then
[time=2250] on the very top he just packs it full those little berries that he actually did pick so it looks like he's got a whole basket full and what happens when it comes time they have dinner and then after
[time=2260] dinner's dessert time and here come the pies and a lot of the kids get really big pies
[time=2266] but the little guy who thought that consequences never catch you learned his lesson because he had
[time=2274] a little itty bitty pie as simplistic as that is that's what one of the prices for playing this
[time=2281] game is all about the consequences catch up and that in a natural way but if there is a god
[time=2290] if there is a god then the consequence for not dealing with honestly with ourselves about our sin
[time=2302] is eternal condemnation now I know it's the 90s and you're not supposed to use those words it's very unpopular but you heard it here one of the consequences of not acknowledging your sin
[time=2314] is standing before god and having to give account for why the basket looked the way it did
[time=2322] because yeah yeah he is loving but he is also just he is also just he is a just judge and he will
[time=2330] do you right he will give you the verdict that you deserve unfortunately and then there are the eternal consequences in other words if you if I keep on existing that
[time=2344] it's not my fault refuse to admit your sin rationalize it trivialize it play games with it
[time=2351] do whatever you do with it but refuse to admit your sin and present it to Christ for forgiveness
[time=2358] the bible says okay then you can have your consequences you see god doesn't want anybody
[time=2368] to have to stand for their consequences god doesn't want anybody to be perished the bible says he desires that all would come to salvation it says there that god sent his son not to condemn the world
[time=2380] but to forgive the world god's desire is to forgive you but he has a way of honoring choices
[time=2389] that we make and if we choose not to admit our fault and our blame and our sin and if we choose
[time=2397] not to ask him to forgive us through the death of christ he honors that decision and we pay the
[time=2405] consequences of our choice well the bible says this it is appointed for men to die once and after
[time=2419] this comes judgment after our life on earth is over and we've looked at this this crossroad of
[time=2430] sorts and we have taken the path that says it's not my fault i will not take responsibility
[time=2438] for my behavior after the physical life is through then he holds us accountable for that choice
[time=2447] now as i wrap this up this morning i want to invite you to say i really to consider
[time=2457] saying two things to god this morning and they're very simple things the first thing is kind of hard and you might guess even what it is the first thing i would
[time=2470] invite you to consider saying to god this morning is this it is my fault i am the one to blame
[time=2479] i do sin i have sinned i am a sinner u_s_c_ professor dallas willard summons the courage to use the s word sin
[time=2491] and in universities around america that's a pretty unpopular word in fact in his book spirit of the discipline willard suggests that there is a quote-unquote
[time=2503] readiness to sin factor in all of us he contends that our readiness to sin is so real that sometimes
[time=2511] only the slightest provocation can release a flood of profanity from our mouths or a surge of slander sometimes the slightest provocation can cause us to want to retaliate
[time=2524] or punish someone or dehumanism i guess my question to you this morning
[time=2531] is there a readiness to sin factor inside of you do you recognize it do you see it
[time=2538] can you identify with the apostle paul when he wrote in roman's chapter seven i find that evil
[time=2547] is present in me is there a readiness to sin factor in you and can you see its product in your life
[time=2556] how many of you live with the conscience awareness that there is a powerful destructive force at
[time=2566] work inside of you that seeks to deceive you disorient you disrupt you and destroy you
[time=2574] is it there g_k_ chesterton was asked to write a series of articles for the london times on the
[time=2583] topic what's wrong in the universe so he pondered a little while and he came back and wrote an
[time=2591] article two words in length that was it his whole article two words he said to the question what's
[time=2599] wrong in the universe he said i am i am what a bold admission of personal response but he didn't
[time=2610] mean he was responsible for everything that's wrong in the universe but he knows that the planet
[time=2616] is full of people just like he is who have a readiness to sin factor and if we didn't have that
[time=2625] readiness to sin factor then the crime and the violence and the hatred and all the stuff we read
[time=2632] about and have to experience in our lives wouldn't be there he says i am i'm the problem in the universe
[time=2641] are you willing to admit that to god that there's a readiness to sin factor in you
[time=2650] the bible says in first john one eight if we say we have no sin i.e. no readiness to sin factor
[time=2658] we lie to ourselves what's that well we play games we play games with ourselves
[time=2666] and the truth is not enough i guess i'm asking you to admit the obvious to a god who already knows
[time=2672] it he knows it about you and he knows it about me there's a readiness to sin factor inside of our
[time=2679] hearts and it gets expressed and we're to blame it's our fault now the second thing i want to invite
[time=2688] you to consider saying to god this morning in fact if there weren't a second thing i wouldn't be here this morning i would not have been here that i would not come this morning if this second thing didn't exist and this is the second thing i'd like you to consider saying to god this morning here it is please forgive me through the death of jesus christ you see if that isn't available
[time=2713] to us then i'm back to those reasons why we should never admit fault i mean why admit our fault and
[time=2720] then just take the consequences i don't want to do that why admit fault and be overpowered with a
[time=2727] sense of contempt and shame in myself why admit guilt and have people reject me and mostly
[time=2735] why admit guilt to god if in doing so he punishes me for all eternity what's the point the point is
[time=2743] this if i admit to him i'm the one to blame and then i ask him to forgive me through the
[time=2751] death of his son i get forgiven of them all i call it the miracle of mercy the mirror
[time=2761] and it's a miracle because it's so different than anything i've ever experienced before i remember uh telling a bit of a we lie to my parents as i was just a child
[time=2773] and they were they were probably aware that i was lying and said they're putting the heat on me saying rasal tell the truth rasal tell the truth you know stay it say it's your fault and i'm thinking
[time=2786] to myself why if i do you're going to spake me right why now see how different it is with god
[time=2795] that's why it's such a miracle he says he says admit your sin to me ask me for forgiveness and i'll
[time=2803] forgive you in a way that nobody else can because god and that's why we sing of him as our awesome god because he has the ability to forgive and to forget and let me tell you something nobody
[time=2814] you know does your teacher remembers your spouse remembers your employer remembers your employer
[time=2820] says thank you for admitting that you're now fired god says thank you for admitting that and
[time=2828] thank you for putting your faith in christ you're now forgiven and let's spend all eternity together
[time=2836] i like that kind of an attitude isn't that a miracle most people don't know that about god
[time=2844] most people think the way to get in good with god is to try not to admit the sins and maybe a
[time=2852] couple big ones but just try to pretend that you're not a sinner that you're really over here on this side with the alleged good people and i haven't met any of those yet and i'm certainly not one of them
[time=2864] most people think the way to get in right with god is to pretend that he's either different that it's somebody else's fault that it's not as bad as i thought it was and god says no no no listen hear it and hear it clear get right with me by standing up and saying it's my fault
[time=2881] and secondly oh please forgive me through the death you say what's this big deal about the death of
[time=2889] jesus how can you keep putting that on the end of that sense how come you can't just say please forgive me why do you always keep saying please forgive me through the death of jesus
[time=2900] let me tell you something there's only one person who's ever lived who in every situation in his life could truly say it's not my fault who is it christ christ was the true and living god christ never sinned against anybody or against god
[time=2918] that's why the old testament calls him the sacrificial lamb the perfect lamb who can be sacrificed for our so what he does is he stands up when god has all of our sins in mind christ
[time=2930] stands up and says it's not my fault i didn't do any of those things but i'll take all the blame
[time=2936] i'll take all the punishment somebody's got to answer for all those bad things i don't want all
[time=2942] these people to do that i love them let me die instead of them and that's what the cross is all
[time=2949] about the only guy in all of history who could ever stand up and say it's not my fault says it's
[time=2955] not my fault but i'll take all the blame i'll take all the penalty i'll take all the wrath
[time=2961] of a just god who must punish sin it's a miracle that's why the bible says he meaning jesus
[time=2970] jesus was pierced through for our transgressions he got pierced for something i did
[time=2977] it says he was crushed for our iniquities he got crushed for something i did something you did
[time=2984] and then it says by his scorching and that's kind of a old-fashioned word for being beaten up
[time=2992] for by his scorching we are healed he pays the price for my wrong doings if if
[time=3003] my fault please forgive me through the death of jesus christ he stands in my stead he stands
[time=3016] in my stead let me tell you a story i think it's just a story i don't think it ever happened but
[time=3022] man as he get this concept clear story is of an indian chief about 40 45 years of age
[time=3028] and there were certain laws in his village and he was responsible as judge to make sure they were properly enforced and there was a particular law that if it was broken meant that you had to
[time=3039] be beaten scorched whipped boardy lashes varying you know punishments for varying offenses and
[time=3046] this one offense you do it you're in for 40 whippings so he's doing his judge thing this particular
[time=3052] day he's sitting on his throne and they bring before him this old lady and she had done this
[time=3059] particular offense that required justice 40 lashes and they presented the evidence and it was
[time=3066] obvious she had done it there was a major problem though that the judge in this case the chief was
[time=3072] having a hard time saying okay meet out the punishment because that old lady was his mother
[time=3079] and he loved her deeply and he knew that if she were to get these 40 lashes she would die she
[time=3087] physically could not handle that amount and so he was in a dilemma he was in a dilemma of love
[time=3093] he loved her and wanted to protect her from that but he was a honest man of justice and he knew
[time=3101] that he couldn't compromise the demands of the law or anarchy would break out and he would lose his integrity that is the exact dilemma that god has with us he loves us and he loves us terribly
[time=3115] but he the evidence is obvious it's our fault we're sinners and then he's this
[time=3123] just god of integrity and ah well in the story the the chief gets up well no first he says okay
[time=3135] strap her to the pole for her punishment and she's going to get whipped and just as she gets strapped to the pole for her punishment he gets up off of his throne and walks down there and wraps his arms around his mother and says okay start beating her and boom the lashes come but not
[time=3154] one of them touches her he takes it all for her okay it's my fault please forgive me through the
[time=3165] death of Jesus Christ he's the one that wants to wrap his arms around you and take the brunt
[time=3172] the penalty the responsibility for your behavior because he knows if you get it
[time=3178] called eternal condemnation he'll never see you again after your days on earth or over any loves you
[time=3186] in a moment i'm going to give you a chance to say those two things to god we're going to pray
[time=3193] together in just a bit here and it's going to be in a sense a point of decision maybe in your life
[time=3199] it's going to be one of these crossroads and i want you to know from the beginning i'm not going to ask you to raise your hand i'm not going to ask you to come for i'm not going to embarrass you i'm not even going to try to identify you it'll just be something that you say to god in your own heart these two things it's my fault please forgive me through the death of Jesus Christ but
[time=3215] because it is a a big decision i want to give you a moment to think about it so i'm going to ask
[time=3221] kevin if he'll come and sing for us and the song that kevin sings is the song of someone who has said
[time=3227] those two things to god it's my fault please forgive me through the person of Jesus Christ
[time=3236] and if you make that decision to do that here in just a minute this can be your song this can be your life this kind of forgiveness the grace of god extends to you through Christ
[time=3267] was known and the light was shown on every hidden part of my soul most would turn away
[time=3278] shake their heads and say he's still has such a long way to go if the truth was known you see
[time=3289] that they only could leave me because jesus oh it's jesus
[time=3301] if the walls could speak of the times i've been weak when everybody thought i was strong
[time=3315] could i shake my hand stand alone and say he's still and such a long way to go
[time=3323] if the truth was known you'd see that my only hope is the grace of jesus
[time=3338] grace of jesus but all the goodness and the grace in him
[time=3350] he takes it all and makes it mine that causes his light in me to shine and he loves me
[time=3364] with a love that never ends just as i am not as i do could this be real could this be true
[time=3382] this could only be a miracle
[time=3388] this could only be the miracle of mercy
[time=3412] well this is a tremendous opportunity for you to get right with god and to say as i have said those two things it's my fault and secondly please forgive me through the death of
[time=3422] christ and as i've indicated if you'd like to pray that prayer with me right now i invite you to bow your head and as i talk out loud and say this prayer out loud if you'll say it in your heart to god he'll hear you and he'll answer your prayer let's pray together
[time=3437] father i know that i am a sinner and i want to confess that to you right now i want to say it's my fault i'm responsible for my sin and i just want to admit and confess that to you
[time=3449] but i also want to ask you to forgive me today through the blood of jesus christ through his death
[time=3455] through his provision through his taking the penalty for my behavior and i thank you for
