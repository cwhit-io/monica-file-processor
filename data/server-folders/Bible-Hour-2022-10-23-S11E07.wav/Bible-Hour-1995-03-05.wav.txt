[time=0] Paul was a man, he was a passionate man.
[time=4] And we've been studying the book of Colossians, and we've turned to Colossians chapter 2, and in this beginning of this chapter, we're going to see that there were three qualities to the passion of Paul.
[time=15] Paul's passion was focused, it was determined, and it was purposeful.
[time=26] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=30] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=31] Associate Pastor Tim Teder will be looking at the life of one man who, apart from Christ,
[time=37] has had the greatest influence on the church.
[time=39] Your invited to join us as he examines the passion which drove the apostle Paul in his ministry to God's people, and consider how we measure up to his expectations for the church.
[time=50] Now let's join our service.
[time=60] We don't need another woman who will uprise thee.
[time=75] We don't need another conquer on the sea.
[time=83] What we need is a special word that will burn within our hearts and give direction from
[time=100] our hearts. We need a word from the Lord, a word from the Lord. Just when we're from the Lord, will you hold us? And cause us some to show.
[time=129] And give peace upon just what we're from the Lord, sweet.
[time=146] Lord, we have the wisdom and the humble standing.
[time=163] Lord, we have the very love you show in the sun.
[time=171] Lord, we call to live our race. And we stand so much to gain. Give us your Lord, sweet Lord.
[time=189] We need a word from the Lord, a word from the Lord. Just when we're from the Lord, will you hold us?
[time=210] And cause us some to show. And give peace upon just what we're from the Lord, sweet.
[time=228] We need a word from the Lord, a word from the Lord. Just when we're from the Lord, will you hold us?
[time=250] And cause us some to show. And give peace upon just what we're from the Lord, sweet.
[time=280] We'll return to the service in just a moment. But right now, let me tell you about a free booklet the Bible Hour is offering.
[time=300] It's entitled God's Promises for Your Encouragement, a full compilation of the many verses from God's Word that offer encouragement, comfort, hope, rest, peace and strength.
[time=311] Here are prayers and powerful nuggets from God's Word grounded in a powerful and loving God.
[time=318] We'll give you our address at the end of the program. Right now, let's return to the service.
[time=324] How firm a foundation ye saints of the Lord is laid for your food in his excellent word.
[time=339] What more can he say than to you he hath said to you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?
[time=354] We're not, I am with you, oh be not dismayed, for I am your God, I will still give you aid.
[time=367] I'll strengthen you, help you and cause you to stand, upheld by my gracious, I'm the important hand.
[time=384] The soul that unJesus hath lead for repose, I will not, I will not desert to his foes,
[time=403] that so though all hell should endeavor to shake, I will never, no never, no never for save.
[time=433] [MUSIC - 157 seconds]
[time=610] [APPLAUSE]
[time=616] I want to thank you for joining us in the Bible Hour today, my name is Tim Teder, I'm one of the associate pastors here at Blackhawk, and as you can probably tell I've been struggling a little bit with the illness and throat problems that many people have found themselves struggling with in the last few weeks.
[time=631] I want to take a little bit of time to tell you about some of the things that are coming up here in the ministry of our church.
[time=637] On April 13th we're pleased to welcome recording artist Steve Green to our church, he's going to be here that night, 7.30 in the evening to do a concert.
[time=647] We have tickets available that we want to welcome you to be a part of that concert to bring friends along and you can contact our church or stop by and get tickets, or you can visit any of the area Christian bookstores and they also have tickets available.
[time=660] Again, that's April 13th, Steve Green here, the concert begins at 7.30 that night.
[time=667] We've enjoyed a couple outreach services already, one in January, one in February, and our next outreach service here at Blackhawk is going to be on the last Sunday of March, March 26th.
[time=679] This is a special service for us, it kind of replaces our typical Sunday morning, and what we do is have a service that is especially geared to the non-church person, the person that may not be comfortable with the normal church setting and structure and program.
[time=694] So our music is a little bit different when we incorporate drama. If you're in our area and not in the habit of attending a church, that's the service I want to encourage you to be a part of.
[time=705] If you're able to come to our church service on March 26th, either at 9.10 or 10.45, please come in, you'll be welcomed as a visitor.
[time=714] Our topic for that morning is conflict resolution.
[time=717] What do you do when you find yourself being pulled apart in a relationship and you really want to come together, but there's something that's coming in between.
[time=723] Well, you're going to enjoy through music and through some humorous drama and through a message by our pastor Russell Moore, a consideration of that topic, conflict resolution.
[time=734] Another one of our associates, Steve Longbrake, who's our school administrator, perhaps you've seen him, you're familiar with him because at times he's sat in this chair and talked to you during our Bible Hour programs.
[time=747] Just want to let you know some of the things that are going on in his life because we appreciate the prayer support of the people that watch the Bible Hour.
[time=756] Steve and his wife Renee have been going through a kind of difficult time lately as Renee's been diagnosed with the beginning stages of a form of cancer.
[time=767] And she's undergone surgery and the doctors are giving good report and we're encouraged by the things that are happening.
[time=774] But as you can imagine, that presents a certain amount of strain and concern and they are trusting in God and doing well.
[time=784] But we love them and just want to ask you who support our ministry and support the leaders involved in it if you would pray with us for Steve and Renee in the weeks and the months ahead.
[time=796] And we'll try to keep you posted on what God is doing in their life.
[time=800] Well, if you've been watching the Bible Hour, you know that from the beginning of the year, we've been on a series of considering what God teaches us through the book of Colossians.
[time=809] Our pastor Russell Moore has been the one who has been leading most of the teaching through the series.
[time=814] He and his wife are enjoying a vacation this week, so it's my privilege to be able to come to you and look at Colossians chapter 2 in the first eight verses of that chapter.
[time=824] As we get into it, we're going to be looking a little bit at the mindset of the Apostle Paul and what he thought especially in regards to the church and the people of the church.
[time=837] So as you listen, I encourage you to even if you have a Bible around the home to open the Bible and turn to that passage and follow along as we look into this next part of Paul's letter to the Christians in the city of Colossae.
[time=850] Again, thank you for being part of the Bible Hour this morning. Now we're going to return to our program.
[time=871] Jesus, the image of the Father come to save us. Jesus, the Holy One of Zion, come to earth.
[time=888] Reflecting God's own light, He is the brightness of His Father's eye.
[time=897] He is the splendor of Shekinah glory, the fullness of God was made flesh in His Son.
[time=909] Shekinah glory, now we can see the invisible one.
[time=919] The ancient of days, worthy of praise, shekinah glory, the image and brightness of God wrapped in His Son.
[time=944] In days gone by, God revealed Himself in many ways His love to show.
[time=953] By miracles and prophets' words He showed us who He was.
[time=963] But in these last days He has revealed to us His secret plan, so we can understand.
[time=977] The temple could not hold His glory. Neither could the tablets made a stone.
[time=994] Nor the precious mighty arc of the covenant.
[time=1003] They were near reflections of the story to unfold.
[time=1012] Shekinah glory, our majesty worthy is Christ.
[time=1022] Shekinah glory, create Her Messiah and soon come in peace.
[time=1032] The sacred place to walk, the obedient Son.
[time=1040] Shekinah glory, our majesty worthy is the Lord.
[time=1052] Shekinah glory.
[time=1062] Ferris, Lord Jesus, oh Lord, you are beautiful.
[time=1072] Those are such great truths.
[time=1077] As soon as I get my power on here.
[time=1080] If I were to ask you, apart from Jesus Christ, who do you think has had the most impact on Christianity?
[time=1089] What one individual apart from Christ has had the most impact on Christianity?
[time=1097] Some might think back to the Reformation and say from our Protestant perspective, well, maybe Martin Luther.
[time=1102] Certainly, he had quite an impact on the way Christianity has formed.
[time=1107] Or maybe if you think back and think, well, no, I think one of the apostles or one of the early church leaders, perhaps John.
[time=1112] I mean, John was the beloved. He was close to Christ. He wrote one of the gospels.
[time=1118] He wrote some of the letters. He gave us revelation.
[time=1123] I think my answer would be Paul.
[time=1126] I think apart from Christ, Paul, more than any other individual, has influenced, impacted Christianity in the church.
[time=1133] If we look at the New Testament, it doesn't take much to realize that over half of what we have here, the letters written were written by Paul.
[time=1143] And Paul was a church leader who, in his missionaries, journeys, exercised great influence on the establishing of Christ's church around the world.
[time=1154] What was it about Paul that allowed him to have so much impact?
[time=1159] What enabled him to have so much influence? Well, obviously, he was especially gifted and anointed and chosen by God for the particular purpose, but there's something else about the person of Paul.
[time=1169] And it comes through his writings.
[time=1172] Paul was a man of particular passion.
[time=1176] Paul was a man of passion, and we look into Colossians 2, where we're going to focus our attention today.
[time=1183] We see three qualities of Paul's passion. We see that Paul's passion was focused, it was determined, and it was purposeful.
[time=1192] Now, it might be good for us by way of review just to go back and consider what we've been looking at.
[time=1196] Some of you may be visiting today or you haven't been around for a few weeks.
[time=1200] We've been looking at the book of Colossians.
[time=1204] A letter written to Christians in the city of Colossi, located in modern-day Turkey.
[time=1209] Paul was writing a letter to them to encourage them to instruct them. He'd never met them. He'd never visited the city apparently.
[time=1217] But a report was being brought back to Paul by a paphras who was a leader-teacher in the church, and a paphras probably came to Christ under Paul's ministry when he was an Ephesus.
[time=1229] And from Ephesus, Paul went to a paphras and established the church there, I mean to Colossi, and established the Colossian church.
[time=1238] And now he comes back to Paul and gives a report of the Colossian church.
[time=1241] And Paul, now in prison, receives this report about the church and writes a letter back to the Christians who were facing opposition from teachers who argued a twisted view of Christianity.
[time=1252] And in this letter, as in other letters, we get some sense of the passion of Paul. Look in chapter 2, and we see first of all that Paul had a focused passion.
[time=1266] First verse, "For I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf, and for those who are at Laodicea, which was a city nearby Colossae, and for all those who have not personally seen my face."
[time=1279] Paul's passion was focused. It had direction. It was focused on God's people, the church of Jesus Christ. Paul had a single focus of mind, and that single focus we see in other scriptures was the person of Jesus Christ, but right alongside of it was the church of Christ, the people of God.
[time=1298] Paul had a passion for them. And it wasn't to those who he just met personally, but to these Christians who he never visited, and to those in a nearby city, and he says to all who have never seen my face, he had a passion. He loved the church.
[time=1313] It's expressed in other passages and other letters that Paul wrote to the church at Corinth. He wrote, "So I will very gladly spend for you everything I have, and expend myself as well."
[time=1324] To the church in Philippi, Paul said, "It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart."
[time=1332] To the Thessalonians, he wrote, "We are gentle among you, like a mother caring for little children. We love you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of God, but our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us."
[time=1346] And in this letter to the Colossians, chapter 1 verse 24, he says, "I rejoice in my suffering for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of his body, which is the church."
[time=1360] Paul had a passion for God's people. Paul had a passion for the church of Christ. Now why would that be?
[time=1368] Well, why would Paul care so much for the church? Well, probably it was because Paul was so in love with the person of Jesus Christ that what was important to Christ, what Christ loved, Paul found himself loving as well.
[time=1386] What Christ had a passion for, Paul had a passion for, and Christ obviously loved the church. When Paul in Acts 20 was giving instruction to the elders at Ephesus, he said to them, "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which he purchased with his own blood."
[time=1411] Ephesus chapter 5, when it's given instructions to husband and how we should love our wives, what does it say? Husbands loved your wives in the same way that Christ loved the church.
[time=1424] 1 John chapter 3, it gives us the pattern of our love for one another, and it says, "Here it is. Here's the pattern Christ laid down his life for us." Christ had a passion for his people. Christ had a passion for the church, and so Paul had a passion for the church as well.
[time=1440] And I think it's true that if we like Paul love Christ, then we will love what Christ loved, and Christ loved people.
[time=1450] Now we get confused about this sometimes. When we think about church, sometimes instead of thinking about the people we think about the program, and so that gets a little confusing to us.
[time=1460] And so we begin to judge church and evaluate church in the basis of its program instead of the basis on the basis of its people.
[time=1468] There are some things you would have never heard from the mouth of Paul, I'm convinced. You would have never heard Paul say, "I don't need the church," because that's a program perspective.
[time=1477] Paul was very clear to say, "Hey, we need each other desperately. All the one-on-others he talks about in his letters?" That's a people perspective of the church.
[time=1486] You've never heard Paul complain, "Well, I'll go to church, but they better not expect too much from me."
[time=1492] Program perspective. Paul had a people perspective, and he said, "Man, I'm willing to give everything for the sake of others."
[time=1498] You've never heard Paul complain, "Well, I'm just not getting anything out of church. It's not doing anything for me." Program perspective. Paul had a people perspective, and he said, "Listen, we have a ministry to one another, and I'm going to use my gifts to help build up God's people."
[time=1515] I'm here to give. Paul had a passion for God's people because Christ had a passion. It was a focused passion.
[time=1521] Not only was his passion focused, but it was determined.
[time=1526] He says in verse 2, "I want you to know how great a struggle I have on your behalf." He was determined in his passion.
[time=1534] He struggled. This word struggle comes from the Greek word agona from which we get the English word agonize.
[time=1541] It has athletic connotations. It's the picture of the athlete who is straining, giving all he can give to reach the prize, to finish the race, to win.
[time=1552] The closest I can relate to this was when I was involved in swim team during my high school days and getting up 5 o'clock every morning and getting on my bike and riding 3 miles to practice and going out there and swimming and swimming to the point of sometimes being physically sick, agonizing.
[time=1570] Why? Because we were working together as a team. We wanted to win. We wanted to achieve.
[time=1575] I'm going to those meets and having the turmoil and the nervousness inside and standing up on the blocks and kneeling down and bending down and waiting for the gun to go to jump out in the water and begin the water sprint.
[time=1586] To go to one side and turn and to go back and forth and sometimes just wishing you could quit because your joints are burning, you're aching, you're giving all you've got, you're agonizing, you're struggling pursuing the goal.
[time=1597] And that's what Paul says here. He says, "I have a struggle. I agonize on your behalf."
[time=1604] We get some picture of the extent of Paul's struggle. When we look back at his letter to the Corinthians in 2 Corinthians chapter 11, here's just a list of some of the things that Paul faced and this struggle and this agonizing.
[time=1616] He says in verses 23 through 29 that he was frequently thrown into prison, received severe floggings. Now just listen, I mean do this job description, see if it's something you'd want to pick up.
[time=1626] Came close to dying again and again, received 39 lashes on five different occasions, beaten with rods three times, stoned once, shipwrecked three times, and in one of those shipwrecks he said he spent a night and a day in the water, lived under constant threats which seemed to come from everywhere, went without food, sleep, clothing, carried the emotional responsibility.
[time=1645] The emotional responsibility of caring for a needy church, those are some of the ways that Paul's struggle.
[time=1653] And he agonized for God's people because he had a passion for he was determined.
[time=1658] And he went through all that and still later here he is in a prison cell writing to a group of Christians that he hasn't even met and he says concerning them, Colossians back in the first chapter at the end.
[time=1670] He says we proclaim him admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom that we may proclaim, present every man complete in Christ in verse 29, and for this purpose also I labor, striding according to his power, which mightily works within me.
[time=1685] Paul continues to serve and to struggle for the church.
[time=1690] But it's the third point, this third quality of his passion that I kind of want to settle on and focus on this morning, and that is that his passion was purposeful.
[time=1700] In fact, if you want to practice this you could say that Paul possessed a purposeful passion, say that four times fast and you win the prize.
[time=1709] Paul's passion was purposeful, I mean it had a goal, why did Paul go through all this?
[time=1717] Well he mentions four things he wants for God's people.
[time=1721] And as we go through this I want to challenge you and challenge us as a church to test ourselves, to examine ourselves as individual believers and as a local body to see how we're doing in these four areas.
[time=1734] Paul's desire for the church and therefore God's desire for the church is that we first of all, look at verse two, that their hearts may be encouraged, encouraged in heart.
[time=1745] That's the first thing he wanted, that they would be encouraged in heart.
[time=1749] Now the word translated and encouraged here carries a number of different meanings, connotations, it can mean encouraged, it means comforted, it can mean strengthened, and it probably carries very heavy connotation of being strengthened.
[time=1759] We're talking to a group of Christians who are struggling, who are facing opposition, and he tells them he wants them to be encouraged and strong of heart.
[time=1769] Be strengthened in your heart. Now when we talk about heart, in the English language we refer to the heart as being kind of the symbol or the seat of emotions, don't we?
[time=1778] My heart longs for you, my heart is broken.
[time=1782] The heart is the symbol of emotions, that's not so in the Hebrew language.
[time=1788] When the Hebrews wrote of the heart, they didn't think of it as the center of emotions because the Hebrews had a different part of the body that they focused on as the center of emotions.
[time=1798] And that was, excuse me, for being so literal, but it was the bowels.
[time=1803] The bowels were the center of emotion for the Hebrews, so when you come to, well let me give you an example.
[time=1808] If you turn to 1 John chapter 3 in verse 17, it's very interesting, now we have different translations here represented, some of you may have King James, some of you have new international versions, some new American standard, and each of these translate the verse a little bit differently.
[time=1824] I'm going to read it out of a new American standard, 1 John 3 17, it says, "Who ever has the world's goods and but holds his brother in need and closes his heart against him, how does the love of God abide in him?"
[time=1837] You see a brother in need and new American standard said, "You close your heart against him." In other words, you have no feeling of remorse, no feeling of pity.
[time=1846] That's how the NIV translates it, having no pity on him.
[time=1849] But you know what it literally says here, you know what the Hebrew word is, if you have an older King James, it says it this way, "Whoever has the world's good and seeeth his brother have need and shuteth up his bowels of compassion for him."
[time=1863] That's literally what it says.
[time=1865] That is a little different, not the way we normally talk, and that's why the most modern translations put it in a way that makes more sense to us, but that's where the Hebrews focused on when they wanted to talk about where the emotions.
[time=1877] And we understand that because I've certainly felt the emotion in my gut.
[time=1883] When I have felt anxiety, where have I felt it?
[time=1887] I am nervousness in my stomach.
[time=1889] My stomach's in knots, we say.
[time=1891] When I have felt grief, when I have felt tremendous grief, it was almost as if something real, material, tangible, was stuck down there in this part of me.
[time=1902] When I felt love, sometimes this is where you feel it.
[time=1908] And so in the Hebrew mind, that's where they would describe the emotion coming from.
[time=1913] If a Hebrew man came up to and wanted to impress you with romantic talk, he wouldn't say, "My heart aches for you."
[time=1919] He'd more likely say something like, "My bowels turn for you." Now guys, you try that out and see how far you get with that line.
[time=1929] The point is, the heart to the Hebrew mindset symbolized more of the whole person, and especially the intellect and will, not the seat of emotion.
[time=1939] I'll give you some examples. Deuteronomy 6.6 says, "These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts."
[time=1946] It's not talking about emotion, it's talking about your will.
[time=1951] Psalm 111, David said, "I have hidden your word in my heart so that I won't sin against you."
[time=1957] Psalm 53 1, "The fool has said in his heart there is no God." Not talking about emotion, he's talking about the choice of will, decision that's made, Proverbs 22-17,
[time=1968] pay attention and listen to the sayings of the wise, "Apply your heart to what I teach." Matthew 5-19, Jesus said, "For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, etc."
[time=1981] So in other words, when Paul says, "I want you to be encouraged in heart," he's saying, "I want you to be strengthened in will or purpose." In other words, "I want you to be of strong determination." He's not saying, "I want you to feel good, I want you to be strongly determined." Because likely he was writing to a group of Christians, maybe, who felt like they really weren't sure they wanted to stay with it.
[time=2001] Some of them were questioning, maybe they'd go back to their former life, abandon this Christianity thing.
[time=2009] Paul encourages them, he says, "I want you to be standing strong, strong in your determination, encouraged in heart."
[time=2018] Second thing he says is that I want you to be, look at verse 2 again.
[time=2026] Having been knit together in love, Paul says, "United in love is the second purpose of his passion."
[time=2036] That Christ's Church, that Christ's body, be united in love.
[time=2042] You know, the body, the physical body is such an interesting piece of creation.
[time=2050] And you realize, I'm sure, that if you take any one cell from your body, from any place on your body, you take that one cell,
[time=2057] you know in that one cell there's contained all the genetic information who you are.
[time=2063] And that one cell is contained the genetic information concerning whether you be man or woman, whether you will have brown hair or red hair or no hair.
[time=2071] Whether your eyes will be blue or whether it will be black or green or hazel, whether you'll be tall or short, wide or thin.
[time=2079] All these things are contained in that one little cell.
[time=2081] Now each cell kind of focuses on its duty in one area of that information, but each cell contains information of the whole person that you individually are.
[time=2089] And yet each cell performs its own unique particular function, or else we'd just be this one blob,
[time=2096] but there's uniqueness to the different parts of us, and it's the same way in Christ's body.
[time=2100] In a very real sense, as Christians we each can carry the spiritual genetic code of Christ.
[time=2106] Each one of us carries Christ in us.
[time=2110] And at each of us, each of us God has given a particular function, a particular duty within the Church and within Christ's body to perform.
[time=2118] And that's how it's supposed to operate, but we work together.
[time=2123] There's unity in what we do.
[time=2125] And when the individual parts don't work together in unity, in the physical body what do we say?
[time=2130] We say there's dysfunction there.
[time=2132] This function may be caused by a birth defect or by an accident or by the invasion of a tumor into the body,
[time=2138] but the body stops working, functioning the way it was designed to function, and in the Church it's the same way.
[time=2145] When the parts of Christ's body cease to function to work together, then we say Christ's body becomes dysfunctional.
[time=2155] And sadly, I would say that too often when we look at the Church we'd see a dysfunctioning body.
[time=2162] We see the Church not operating, not functioning the way it was designed and meant to function.
[time=2169] And there's all kinds of causes, there are all kinds of reasons that we give for not being united, maybe the color of somebody's skin,
[time=2175] or maybe their social status, or maybe their denomination, or maybe their appearance, or maybe their political affiliation, or maybe the translation of Bible that they use or whatever.
[time=2186] And yet we pull apart, and there isn't unity.
[time=2191] Giving an illustration of how bad it can get, and I don't know if I've given this before, but this came out of a news story in Wales told of a Church that was having a little disagreement among the believers in that Church.
[time=2204] They were looking for a new pastor, and here's what the newspaper said, and said yesterday the two opposition groups both sent ministers to the pulpit.
[time=2214] Both of the ministers spoke simultaneously, each trying to shout above the other. This would have been an interesting Sunday morning.
[time=2221] It says both called for hymns, and the congregation sang two different hymns, each side trying to drown out the other.
[time=2228] Then the two groups began shouting each other, Bibles were raised in anger, the Sunday morning service turned into bedlam,
[time=2234] through it all, the two preachers continued trying to outshout each other with their servants.
[time=2239] Well, I bet God was just really honored by that whole scene.
[time=2244] Now, I just imagine in that Church, if we could have gone back a year previously and painted that picture of their future and said,
[time=2251] "Would that be what you, is this what you will become?" No, no, of course not.
[time=2256] But somewhere along the way the body becomes dysfunctional and starts working against itself instead of working together.
[time=2265] How do we protect unity? How do we keep ourselves knit together?
[time=2269] Well, he tells us right here, he says knit together in what?
[time=2274] In what? In love.
[time=2277] Knit together in love.
[time=2280] Love maintains a forgiving heart.
[time=2284] When others wrong you, love forgives.
[time=2288] Love speaks only what is true and loving about one another. That's what love does. That maintains unity.
[time=2295] Love does not isolate from others.
[time=2298] We come together in this building to meet as God's people, a local assembly in Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=2305] And sometimes maybe our focus gets a little narrow. We start to think of ourselves as the Church.
[time=2310] We think of Church as us.
[time=2312] You know that the Church, the body of Christ is much more than just this local congregation.
[time=2319] You know that God's Church doesn't have walls.
[time=2325] Galatians 3 paints this picture so well when it says, "You are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For all of you were baptized in Christ having clothed yourselves with Christ."
[time=2335] It says, "There is neither in Christ." It says, "There is not Jew or Greek, slave or free male or female."
[time=2342] And we could go on, we could add to the list.
[time=2344] There's not young or old, rich or poor, Calvinist or a minion, Baptist or assembly of God, Blackhawk Baptist Church or the chapel or any other church.
[time=2359] We're all one in Christ. If we are trusting in Christ and Savior's and Lord, we are part of His body and we are to be united together in love.
[time=2367] That's what Paul says. You're all one in Christ.
[time=2371] In fact, the Scripture is so strong on this point that it says, "Our love for one another is a proof of our genuine Christianity in 1 John."
[time=2379] It says, "If you say you love God but you don't love one another, your Christianity is worthless. It's a lie."
[time=2388] Paul had a passion for the church. If they be encouraged in heart, united in love, then he says he also has a passion.
[time=2398] If they be grounded in truth, look at the end of verse 2.
[time=2401] Attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding.
[time=2407] He goes on to say more about that. What he's basically saying is that he desires for them that they will be settled in understanding or grounded in the truth.
[time=2417] They will be grounded in the truth.
[time=2421] It makes such a difference when you know that where you're standing is solid, that what you're believing in is trustworthy.
[time=2430] It makes a difference when you're walking on solid foundation and when you would walk, well, for instance, there's a lake not far from here.
[time=2437] I believe it's called Pine Lake and occasionally we'll go with students or with family and visit the lake and they have this recreational section that's kind of interesting.
[time=2446] One part where you hold on to ropes as you walk on these inner tubes, a pathway of inner tubes, and you think, well, that's no big deal, but you try it sometime.
[time=2455] You look totally ridiculous because your feet, they're going all over the place, these tubes are sliding in and out and around.
[time=2460] I mean, this foundation isn't secure, it's not solid, so you look kind of foolish. Sometimes in the church maybe we get that way.
[time=2469] We're so wobbly, we're so insecure because we're not grounded in the truth.
[time=2477] How do I get grounded in the truth? Well, certainly we can pray that God would make us grounded.
[time=2482] That's what Paul prayed for the Colossians. He says that in verse 9 of chapter 1.
[time=2488] But I think he goes on here to say also that the way we get grounded in the truth is that we grow in a relationship with Christ, we get to know Christ.
[time=2495] Look what he says, verse 2 again, Colossians 2, attaining to all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding, resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery.
[time=2503] What is that mystery? Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge?
[time=2510] In Christ or hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, you want to be grounded in truth, get to know Christ.
[time=2516] Now that's why when Satan comes in and tries to attack the truth of the church, this is the very core of what will be attacked, who Christ is and what he has accomplished.
[time=2526] When you study the cults, the false beliefs, you see that most of them get off on one of these areas.
[time=2533] Either they deny that Jesus Christ is God, they deny his deity, or they deny that what Jesus did was good enough.
[time=2540] That Christ didn't quite finish, it didn't do everything that needed to be done, so there's something else that you have to do to accomplish the work of God's salvation.
[time=2549] But Christ is enough.
[time=2551] And if you get to know him, you are grounded because you have confidence in him, you know you can trust him.
[time=2557] Confidence is grounded in trust.
[time=2560] This past week I sold a computer, notebook computer, and I put it up on an electronic bulletin board, and someone from Virginia wrote back and said I'm interested in buying it.
[time=2571] So we made arrangements and I shipped it off to him, COD, and there's a check coming back to me for $850.
[time=2577] I don't know this guy, he seems nice, but I don't know him.
[time=2582] I'll tell you what I'm going to do when I get that check, I'm going to go to the bank, I'm going to have him check it out.
[time=2586] I want you to tell me that this is good, because I'm in trouble if it's not.
[time=2590] Why am I going to do that? Because I don't know him, I can't trust someone I don't know.
[time=2594] If my wife came to me after the service today and said oh honey, I just want to give you a little something and here, she hands me a check written out of her personal account to me for $25,000, I'd laugh.
[time=2607] Because I know my wife, I know she doesn't have $25,000.
[time=2610] But if I met Bill Gates and we struck up a conversation, I mean Bill Gates owns billions and billions.
[time=2616] If he wrote me a check for $500,000 and gave it to me, I'd run to the bank and cash that thing right away before he changed his mind.
[time=2622] I know he's got it, I know that's worth something.
[time=2625] You see, what you know about the person determines your trust, your ability to trust them.
[time=2629] And when we know the riches of Christ, we can trust that what he says he will do, be grounded in the truth.
[time=2639] Paul said this to the church at Colossae because they needed to be grounded.
[time=2645] Looking at verses 4 and 5, I say this in order that no one may delude you with persuasive argument.
[time=2650] The connotation of that phrase persuasive argument is persuasive speech that a lawyer might give when the lawyer knows he's not telling the truth.
[time=2657] But still speaks persuasive, I'm not suggesting that all lawyers do that, I'm just saying if that were to happen, that's the connotation of this phrase here.
[time=2664] That no one may delude you with persuasive argument, for even though I am absent in body, nevertheless I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline in the stability of your faith in Christ.
[time=2676] Look down in verse 8, see to it that no one takes you captive, that's a military term, they're in spiritual warfare and he says make sure no one takes you prisoner of war.
[time=2684] See, no one takes you as a prisoner of war through philosophy and empty deception according to the tradition of men, according to the elementary principles of the world rather than according to Christ.
[time=2693] Be grounded on the truth of Jesus Christ.
[time=2696] There's all kinds of contemporary deceptions, new age channelers that claim to give you some insight into spiritual dimension, self-help gurus, those who deny Jesus' deity are still writing books today, attempts to redefine God through science, all kinds of things that attempt to lead us apart from the truth of Christ.
[time=2716] And it's not hard to do, it's not hard to present a counterfeit.
[time=2720] Watching TV this past week program called Next Step on the Discovery Channel and they were showing how with the advancement of technology even in copy machines, how easy it is to take real money and to using some of the high end copy machines to copy and make fake money that looks real.
[time=2740] They did it and took it out and spent it on camera and showed that store owners took it. It's easy to make counterfeit unless we get ideas the government's taking steps to keep us from being able to do that too easily.
[time=2753] And you know what, in the spiritual realm it's easy to make counterfeits too, to present counterfeits.
[time=2757] I'll guarantee you, you go tomorrow morning.
[time=2760] Go downtown, find some space that's open, some office spot that's available.
[time=2765] Open it up, put a sign out front that says the center of the discovery of spiritual oneness with vegetables.
[time=2773] And you'll have people, "Hey, what's this about?" Oh, well, man, we're here to study, just how the spiritual dimension and the oneness we have with the vegetables.
[time=2781] I mean, there's some kind of tie there, some belonging, and I'll guarantee you'll have people that will come and be part of your little thing, the first Church of the Jolly Green Giant.
[time=2792] It's unbelievable what some people follow. You look and go, "That is absurd, that is ridiculous." And it's not hard to produce counterfeits, and Paul says to the people, "Man, be grounded, know what the truth is, no Christ and be grounded in the truth."
[time=2806] And then he finally says, fourth thing, be progressing in your Christian life, progressing in Christ as a fourth purpose of his passion.
[time=2823] Chapter two, verse six, "As you therefore have received Christ as Lord, as you have received Christ as Lord," that's how he came to Christ.
[time=2833] Christ is Lord, we come to him, we give our lives to him, but it doesn't stop there.
[time=2838] It says, "As you have received Christ as Lord, so walk in him," talking about a lifestyle of continuing with Christ.
[time=2848] About a month and a half ago when we were studying early in Colossians, chapter 1, verses 9 and 10, I made the point that a godly mind produces a godly life.
[time=2859] Paul early in this letter says in those verses, "We have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding."
[time=2868] Why? So that you may walk in a matter worthy of the Lord.
[time=2873] A godly mind produces a godly life.
[time=2876] So when we go back and we are grounded in Christ, we are grounded in the truth.
[time=2882] What it should be producing in our life is a progression in our faith, progressing in Christ.
[time=2891] Your Christianity should be a continual lifestyle of learning to be like Christ.
[time=2895] What would Jesus do?
[time=2898] When Paul goes on, Paul goes on to describe this walk with Christ in verse 7.
[time=2902] He does it with four participles and one's past tense, three of them are present tense.
[time=2907] Look what he says first of all, he says first of all past tense says, "You having been firmly rooted, that's something that happened once and for all, you were rooted.
[time=2914] And when you came to Christ, you were planted in the foundation of Christ, that can't be changed, that's not moved, that is their solid firm."
[time=2922] Then out of that, some other things continue to happen, present tense, he says, being built up in him, established in your faith, just as you were instructed and overflowing with gratitude.
[time=2936] Those are the things that should be continually happening in our lives.
[time=2944] That was the purpose of his passion for God's people, those are the things he wanted to see happen.
[time=2951] Now, if we were just to approach this passage and make it an intellectual exercise, that's great, I understand a little bit more of what Paul's saying here in chapter 2 verses 1 through 7.
[time=2962] It may have some benefit, but very little, because the intent of God's word is always that it come into our life and impact us in such a way that it changes us.
[time=2976] So here's what I want to challenge you as we close this morning.
[time=2979] Let's take what we learn from Paul's passion and his longing for the church of Christ and God's longing for his church, his body.
[time=2989] Let's ask it about ourselves.
[time=2994] Are we strong in heart?
[time=2999] Are we strong in heart? Are you strong in heart?
[time=3005] Are you at the place where you feel like maybe we should just throw in the towel, things are too difficult, things are too hard?
[time=3013] Look at all the difficulty our church has faced in the last months, maybe it's just not worth it.
[time=3021] Or you remain steadfast.
[time=3023] Do you remain determined?
[time=3025] Paul reminded the Christians here, he says, "I want you to remember that I am suffering on your behalf."
[time=3032] And there are others that suffer on your behalf as well.
[time=3035] Do you know that others in the past and present are suffering today for the church of Christ, which includes you, which includes me.
[time=3042] And for me to be so flippant about, well, maybe it's just not worth hanging in there.
[time=3048] The values, all that has been done from the sacrifice of Christ onto the sacrifice of others,
[time=3054] giving themselves for the body of Christ, for us.
[time=3060] Are you strong in heart?
[time=3065] Are you united in love?
[time=3069] Are we as a church united in love?
[time=3072] A scripture makes it very clear that we are united.
[time=3075] To the spirit of Jesus Christ, we possess unity with one another.
[time=3079] But the instruction of scripture is that we need to make the effort to keep that unity.
[time=3084] The fact of the unity, we have to keep it knit together and that comes through loving one another.
[time=3089] How are we doing?
[time=3093] Are you united in love?
[time=3097] I believe our church has had a time where we're really suffered from the attack of gossip, sometimes slander,
[time=3107] sometimes unsigned letters that have been sent to various people in the church that are vicious.
[time=3116] That's not the knitting together.
[time=3118] That's not love.
[time=3119] That produces a disfunctioning body.
[time=3124] And if some of us, if some of you are apart of that kind of talk, of that kind of doing, you know, you get home,
[time=3132] you can't wait to get on the phone or get with so-and-so to talk about the next juicy thing or to put someone down or to criticize.
[time=3139] And of course we do it all in the light of concern for, you know, God's work, baloney.
[time=3145] If it's not love, if it's not love, then it's coming in to break us apart, not knit us together.
[time=3152] And I know, I mean, you carry the risk of even mentioning that some people are going to get upset because they want to judge your motives for saying this.
[time=3160] Am I trying to protect something or someone?
[time=3162] No, I just long for a church that loves one another.
[time=3170] And then if you listen to this and there's a sense of defensiveness in your own heart, I would just ask you to honestly evaluate yourself.
[time=3177] That may be just an indication that there's an area you need to settle in your life, something that's not right.
[time=3181] And I just beg you, I implore you as a church.
[time=3183] Let's be united together in love.
[time=3186] And not just with one another here.
[time=3188] Let's not have such a closed view of the church that we think, "Oh, it's just Blackhawk.
[time=3192] Let's do it together." It's not just Blackhawk.
[time=3194] It's every other person who is trusting in Jesus Christ in Fort Wayne and around the world.
[time=3200] So we need to have a willingness to even reach out our hands to say, "We are united with you, with you, with you."
[time=3210] Are you grounded in truth?
[time=3212] How are you doing in the pursuit of understanding this book?
[time=3215] How are you doing in growing in relationship with Jesus Christ and knowing Him so that you know you're standing on something that's solid and firm?
[time=3223] It's not wavering.
[time=3228] Or have you gotten so used in your Christianity to the book that you kind of get the sense "Well, there's really nothing new for me to learn." We kind of come each Sunday, you sit down and you listen to a message, you sit in an A-B-F, you sit in a discussion group, and the truth comes out and it goes in one ear.
[time=3243] It floats around for a little bit, but you find it dribbling out the other side.
[time=3246] It doesn't seem to be settling in like it used to.
[time=3249] We're not pursuing the truth of God like we're used to.
[time=3252] We need to be grounded in truth because there will be many people who come who want to raise opposition to what we believe.
[time=3259] What God says is true, so we need to be grounded, firmly grounded here.
[time=3264] The last question.
[time=3268] Are you progressing in your Christian walk?
[time=3270] Are you progressing in Christ?
[time=3272] Are you growing?
[time=3273] Are you going on?
[time=3276] So many times it seems we talk about sharing testimony.
[time=3279] For many people, the testimony has always passed tense.
[time=3282] What God did for me way back when?
[time=3284] Well, what's happening now?
[time=3286] Very specifically, let me ask this question.
[time=3290] What is it in the last week?
[time=3292] What will be more generous?
[time=3293] What is it in the last month that God has been working in your life?
[time=3297] Where has he been working to change you to make you more like Christ?
[time=3300] What is it?
[time=3302] What is the area now that you see changing God working to make you more Christ-like in the past month?
[time=3310] Because if we were at the place where we just kind of leveled out or even start falling away, my words are a dangerous spot.
[time=3317] And Paul's passion for the people of God is that they would continue on.
[time=3321] They would progress towards the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3324] They would pursue Christ.
[time=3326] They would pursue the truth of God.
[time=3327] They would pursue one another.
[time=3329] And that's what Paul lived for.
[time=3331] That's what Paul died for because of his passion to see that be true among the people of God.
[time=3338] So the passion of your heart is the passion of mine to see that same sort of vitality,
[time=3344] that same sort of groundedness, that same sort of love, that same sort of dependency on Christ.
[time=3349] In this place, in my life, in yours, I hope it is.
[time=3354] I hope it is.
[time=3355] Would you pray with me?
[time=3359] Father, it is a good thing that you have given us one another, the body of Christ.
[time=3365] We need each other.
[time=3368] And only together as we function and we cooperate and we have unity.
[time=3373] Do we really accomplish what you set us to accomplish as the body of Christ?
[time=3377] And do we really give witness to the world of what Jesus Christ can do in us?
[time=3382] And we become dysfunctional.
[time=3385] We become poor testimony.
[time=3386] We become ineffective.
[time=3387] God help us to be powerfully effective in this church at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3392] And as we spread that influence around the world, not for our good and not for our glory,
[time=3398] not so that we're praised, but God so that you are recognized, so that you are seen as good, so that your name is praised.
[time=3405] And we ask the name of Jesus Christ.
[time=3408] [AMEN] Today we've spent time looking at Paul's passion for God's people, the church.
[time=3429] I'd just like to say a word to some of you who may be somewhere in your past.
[time=3434] I've had an experience or some perception that has left you with maybe a bad taste of the church.
[time=3440] I want to remind you that the church is not an organization.
[time=3443] It's not a building.
[time=3445] It's not a denomination.
[time=3447] It's the coming together of God's people.
[time=3450] And if you've fallen out of the habit of attending church, I want to encourage you to consider going back to a place
[time=3457] where you can learn from God's Word and be around people who encourage you in the right way of life.
[time=3463] Of course, Blackhawk would love to be a place where you might want to come and visit and consider plugging back into church, or even be a resource to answer questions about this topic
[time=3474] or any issue related to a spiritual concerns or your own relationship with God.
[time=3479] So if we can be of any help, be sure to contact us and let us know.
