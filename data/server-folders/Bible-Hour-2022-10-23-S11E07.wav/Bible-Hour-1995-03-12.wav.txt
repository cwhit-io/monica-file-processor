[time=0] [MUSIC]
[time=8] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=12] We're delighted you've joined us.
[time=14] One of the greatest truths in all the Word of God is that if we accept Christ once, salvation
[time=20] is complete.
[time=21] We don't have to come up with a list of ten religious activities to faithfully perform so that Christ plus our devotion will result in salvation.
[time=30] When we have Christ, we have everything, and our salvation is complete.
[time=36] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore continues our study and collations on the sufficiency of Christ.
[time=42] Now, let's join our service.
[time=60] Marvellous praise of our loving Lord, Praise that they seek our sin and our guilt,
[time=80] Yandiran, El, O, Risa, O, Tavoor, Him, where above the man was still.
[time=100] Praise, praise God's grace, Praise that we'll part them, and friends with Him, Praise
[time=126] God's grace, Praise that He's greater, and our sin, and our sin, and all our sin.
[time=146] Amazing grace, how sweet the sun that saved a rich like me.
[time=164] I want what lost, but now I'm found, was blind, but now I see the sin that we can't
[time=184] find, but cannot fail to wash in a way.
[time=201] Lord, there is no way of being so dark, why the earth can show you may be today.
[time=223] Praise, marvelous grace, O God's infinite grace, Praise that we'll part of, and friends
[time=243] with Him, Praise God's infinite grace, Praise that His nature, and all our sin.
[time=263] Praise God's grace, O God's grace, O God's grace, O God's grace, O God's grace,
[time=366] and how the Lord can help deal with situations of anger.
[time=371] And so if you've never been to our church, if you don't know Christ yet as your Savior, you'd like to know a little bit more about Blackhawk, a little bit more about the gospel and how Christ can relate to your problem with anger, to your struggle, the very common struggle with anger, we invite you to come.
[time=388] And if you happen to be a believer and would like to bring an unbeliever, you're welcome as well.
[time=393] Those service times are 9/10 and 10/50, March 26th, that's a Sunday morning and you're
[time=399] welcome to join us.
[time=400] The other very special date is April 13th.
[time=403] We have an evening concert with Steve Green and if you know of Steve Green, he's just marvelously gifted of God with a beautiful voice and he'll be lifting up that voice to the glory of God and kind of a worship, praise, concert and you're welcome to be a part of that as well.
[time=417] You can buy tickets for that through the local Christian bookstores here in Fort Wayne.
[time=421] That's April 13th, it'll be at 730 and we would invite you to join us for that.
[time=428] Well now let's go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=432] We'll return to the service in just a moment but right now let me tell you about a free booklet the Bible Hour is offering.
[time=438] It's entitled God's Promises for Your Encouragement, a full compilation of the many verses from
[time=444] God's Word that offer encouragement, comfort, hope, rest, peace and strength.
[time=450] There are prayers and powerful nuggets from God's Word grounded in a powerful and loving God.
[time=456] We'll give you our address at the end of the program.
[time=459] Right now let's return to the service.
[time=467] In my home to feel through every pain, every tea, there is a God who's been faithful to
[time=486] me, when my strength was all gone, and my heart had no soul, even then God was faithful
[time=508] to me.
[time=514] We were that He promised you no it's so true.
[time=523] And what I thought was so impossible, I see my God too.
[time=535] He's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=551] Looking back, His love and mercy I see, go in my heart I question, and I fail to believe
[time=575] still God's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=588] Now in my heart looked away, and the many, many times I could not believe.
[time=609] Then God was faithful to me, the days that I spent selfishly reaching out for what please
[time=628] know, even then my God was still faithful to me.
[time=641] And every time that I would come back to you, and he was waiting with his big open arms,
[time=659] I see once again, that he's been faithful, faithful to me.
[time=679] Your love and His love and His mercy I still see, go in my heart I question, and I fail
[time=698] and I fail to believe still God's been faithful, faithful He's been so faithful in my heart
[time=717] I had questioned, and I failed to believe in God's been faithful, faithful in my heart
[time=733] I had questioned, and I failed to believe still God's been faithful.
[time=746] So faithful to me, He's been so faithful, also faithful to me.
[time=776] Amen, thank you, Reed.
[time=787] What a wonderful morning of music we've had, I'm so thankful for our choir and for Scott and for the tremendous ministry they have and for Tim, just a joy.
[time=796] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bible and come to Matthew.
[time=801] Matthew chapter 23, and as you know we're studying the book of Colossians, and we're going to get there, but I think it's important that we start over here in Matthew 23 and then find our way to Colossians 2.
[time=815] One of the truly salient marks in the life and ministry of our Lord while He was here
[time=822] on earth was the sharp contrast between the way that He would treat and respond to the
[time=831] common ordinary everyday sinner, and on the other hand how He would treat false teachers.
[time=840] To the common ordinary day sinner He was patient, He was long-suffering, He was compassionate,
[time=848] He hurt for them, He wept for them, He labored for their salvation.
[time=852] We could think of a number of examples that would show that to us, the woman at the well, for example, who was a terrible adulterous running up, you know, numbers of men in her
[time=862] life, and yet there was no harshness to His tone or His demeanor or to His words.
[time=868] There was just compassion and He labored to work with an illustration about water, to try to open her eyes, to see the solution that He could represent in her life.
[time=878] We could see the way He treated the rich young ruler, this man who was completely lost in his understanding about life and a worldview and really believed with all of his heart that his substance and his wholeness came from his money, and he was refusing to part
[time=893] with his money and had a very self-righteous attitude about himself.
[time=898] And never do you see there an angry spirit or a confrontive spirit, it's just a gentle working of the Lord trying to bring this person into an understanding of salvation.
[time=908] The contrast between the ordinary sinner and the false teacher might best be shown in
[time=914] the incident with the woman who was caught in adultery, where this lady was taken out of the very act, out of bed itself, caught in that act and brought immediately into the presence of our Lord, one wonders if she had even fully clothed herself or if she'd just been able to grab something.
[time=930] I mean, she looked the part she was, she was doing it, they caught her, there was no question.
[time=935] You know what happened, the Lord looked at her and had compassion on her and bid her not to sin like that anymore and he said to those false religious teachers, those false
[time=946] teachers in a very confrontive way that if she was going to be stoned, which would have been the Old Testament requirement, the one among them who had never sinned was the one to pick up that first stone.
[time=957] Towards the common ordinary day sinner he was soft and compassionate and gracious and patient,
[time=964] and yet he was intolerant of false teachers.
[time=968] There was a real intolerance in his heart and in his mind and in his ministry for false teachers, people who stand up and say they know the path that leads to God, people who
[time=980] stand up and call others to follow them into some religious belief, but whose path does
[time=986] not lead to God and whose belief is a wrong belief.
[time=991] Those are false teachers, people who aren't among the common ordinary folk, I mean they stand up and they say listen to me and follow me and this is how it works, this is how you get to heaven.
[time=1003] Those false teachers found the Lord to be anything but compassionate.
[time=1008] It seemed as if he reaches a point or reached a point in his life and his ministry where he no longer weeps for them, has no compassion for them and instead he becomes viciously
[time=1018] confrontive, he exposes them and in fact curses them.
[time=1022] If that doesn't sound like our Lord to you, why don't you follow along here Matthew 23 and you'll see him confronting and this really is the apex, the pinnacle of this attitude
[time=1033] and this confronting of false teachers, verse 13.
[time=1037] But woe to you and woe by the way is a curse, I mean it's like saying damn you, which is what he was saying, but woe to you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you shut
[time=1047] off the kingdom of heaven from men for you do not enter it yourselves nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.
[time=1054] It's just damn you people, woe to you because you shut off the entrance into a true relationship
[time=1063] with God.
[time=1064] You not only avail yourself of that but because of your legalism in this case, you shut it
[time=1070] off for others who would follow your leadership.
[time=1073] Verse 14 woe to you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you devour widows houses even while for a pretense you make long prayers therefore you shall receive greater
[time=1084] condemnation.
[time=1085] On the outside they're making great prayers of religious devotion for the widow.
[time=1090] On the inside they have a religious system which so commits them the widow to give of her resources the house is literally devoured.
[time=1099] Verse 15 woe to you scribes and you Pharisees you hypocrites because you travel about on
[time=1105] sea and land and make one proselyte that'd be a person who would convert to their legalistic view of God.
[time=1113] And when he becomes a proselyte you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourself.
[time=1119] In other words you should have left him alone.
[time=1121] He was closer to God before you got yourself involved in his life and sunk your hooks into him and taught him wrongly that salvation could be earned through the legalistic efforts of men the religion of self achievement.
[time=1133] But see you converted him.
[time=1135] You brought him into a new religious system and told him he could know the true and living God and now he's more lost than he was before because he thinks he's found it.
[time=1145] But what he has found isn't life it's death.
[time=1149] Goes on to verse 16 woe to you blind guides who say whoever swears by the temple and he goes into a long discussion they're about religious lying and being able to be a liar but look religious in the process.
[time=1161] Verse 23 woe to you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites for you tithe, mint and dill
[time=1167] and cumin and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law.
[time=1171] In other words you come to church you come to your religious synagogue you do your religious thing and you give of your money we just did that here a minute ago.
[time=1178] You give some of your of your resources.
[time=1181] But what you refuse to give is what God really wants the weightier provisions of the law namely verse 23 justice and mercy and faithfulness.
[time=1191] But you don't give that you're a legalist you have a religious system and you're trying
[time=1198] to fool people that's what a hypocrite is it's a person who looks one way but is another and there is no tolerance for them.
[time=1207] Verse 25 woe to you scribes and you Pharisees you hypocrites.
[time=1210] Now here it is for you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish but inside you are
[time=1216] full of robbery and self-indulgence he just grabs a very common ordinary everyday example
[time=1222] of washing dishes.
[time=1223] He says what good does it do to clean the outside of that dish oh yeah when you hold
[time=1229] it up at a certain level that's all you can see is a clean dish but what's inside?
[time=1235] What's inside has been untouched it is filthy and in the spiritual dimension you clean up
[time=1241] the outside of your life you look like you're committed you look like you're you're religious you look like you're forthright and honest but you're not inside you are full of robbery
[time=1253] which goes back to their false religious system they would extract enormous amounts of money from people and offerings from people because they had the people believing it was necessary for their salvation and they are self-indulgent there was no you know self-sacrificing servant's
[time=1269] heart in their leadership.
[time=1272] Verse 27 woe to you damn you scribes and you Pharisees you hypocrites for you are like
[time=1278] whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness another common ordinary example.
[time=1288] We remember people with the tombstone there we want it to look pretty and sometimes we make it out of white granite or whatever it is and it has a pristine sense to it and we honor their memory and we want to be able to go back that's all okay but he's saying the reality of that condition is it's nice on top but underneath it's decay and it's death and he's saying that's what your life is like.
[time=1309] On the outside you're clean and you're pretty and you have an appearance of something that is whole and healthy and good but we go just past the thin veneer of your hypocrisy and
[time=1320] we find dead men's bones and the decay and the uncleanliness that comes with it.
[time=1326] Woe to you scribes and you Pharisees you hypocrites verse 29 for you build the tombs of prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous and say if we had been living in the day of our fathers we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets but he goes on to note that is exactly what they are doing and what they
[time=1345] will do in his own case they will kill the prophet of prophets.
[time=1350] And so there is this intolerance in the life of our Lord in sharp contrast to the patience
[time=1358] that he has for the common loss center for the false teacher.
[time=1363] Now with that in view come with me to Colossians 2 if you would and the whole book of Colossians
[time=1370] is really a rebuttal against some false teachings and they are really clustered in chapter 2
[time=1382] and the one that we're going to look at today is it's appropriate that we would have read Matthew 23 because it is a form of legalism.
[time=1390] The false teaching that is coming at these dear saints in Colossae is a form of Judaistic
[time=1397] legalism that is mixed I think with some pagan legalism it's hard to be certain but look at verse 16 the argument that they are building.
[time=1406] Therefore chapter 2 verse 16 therefore let no one act as your judge in regard to food
[time=1413] or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day.
[time=1419] You see these false teachers are coming in amongst these new believers and they're saying that if you really want to be sure that you're saved if you want to really be certain that
[time=1429] you're going to get to go to heaven when life is over and all is said and done you it's not enough just to have accepted Christ.
[time=1438] There are some other things that you simply must do or your salvation is in question it
[time=1444] is likely that you will not get to heaven and what are those things the what you eat
[time=1450] the food there that you see mentioned in verse 16 and the drink there are certain things you simply cannot eat and there are certain things you simply cannot drink and there are certain festivals and new moons and Sabbath days that you must observe and if you don't
[time=1465] do that stuff then your salvation is in question and they were being judged.
[time=1471] You see it in verse 16 let no one judge you man made law it's interesting you need to
[time=1477] know this none of these references of food and drink and festival and new moon and Sabbath were at this point in time God given laws they may have been God given in the Old Testament
[time=1489] under those conditions but in the new covenant the new relationship with Christ they are nowhere repeated and they are nowhere taught by God as being binding these are the words and the standards of men that men hold up on their own and then look at other men and say do you measure up to my standard they were judging them and spiritually intimidating them and
[time=1511] saying because you don't eat certain things or you do eat certain things because you don't drink or do drink because you don't observe or do observe you are either in or out of the kingdom being judged on this basis.
[time=1524] You can just imagine some new convert in that day or even in a day like our day some person says you know I've just come to Christ I've just found that I can be saved in the person of Christ and I want to come and I want to worship and I want to study and I want to learn and I want to I want to be wrapped up in the person of Christ and somebody inside that church pulls him aside well that's all good and well but you know it's really not
[time=1547] enough what do you mean it's not about you understand it to truly be spiritual to truly
[time=1555] make it into the kingdom of God you can't eat certain things and you can't drink certain
[time=1561] things and you and you must do these certain things and what they in essence do is they
[time=1567] say that Christ is not enough for salvation now a very important point it is true that
[time=1575] where God has spoken his law we keep it because we love Christ and it does give evidence that we are saved and if a person belligerently and long term and consistently and habitually
[time=1588] does not pay attention to the laws of the New Testament that are for us it may in fact mean that salvation is not real but these are not the laws of God these are the laws of men this is the legalism the false man made laws the traditions that were being brought
[time=1606] into this Christian community and in essence says that Christ is not enough and Paul is
[time=1613] saying I got news for you Christ is more than enough Christ is all you need Christ is everything
[time=1622] in fact look at verse 10 and the passage will study this morning really goes from 9 to 17 and I've jumped to the back of it because I want to kind of set the backdrop for our study of really the meat of this passage but he summarizes where he's going in verses 9 and 10 he says for in him in Christ all the fullness of deity dwells in bodily form and verse 10 in him you have been made what complete I mean it's over if you're in Christ
[time=1649] you're complete your your whole spiritual well being with God is resolved it's done it's
[time=1655] over there's nothing more to be said there's nothing more to be added there's nothing that can be taken away and he lifts up the person of Jesus Christ and so that's kind of a introduction
[time=1667] to what he's going to say now he says three he says it three ways in verses 11 to 15 and we'll look at those this morning he's going to say that Christ is enough because in Christ you have complete salvation number one number two you have complete forgiveness for your sins and number three you have complete victory over the forces of darkness Christ is enough
[time=1687] you don't need legalism it's all bound up in Christ and to illustrate it or to prove
[time=1693] it to us this morning he says your salvation is complete in Christ your forgiveness is complete in Christ and your victory is complete in Christ and it really lifts the Lord up
[time=1703] and I love that I love the way that Paul refuses to get into the details of the false religious system I mean he just gives him one verse and all the rest of this stuff is about Christ in other words he is saying the best way for me to show you how idiotic and stupid it is
[time=1719] to believe that something legalistically you could perform or do could get you into heaven
[time=1726] I'm not going to so much address that I'll just show you what Christ has done and when you're done understanding what Christ has done to moot point and I think you'll see that as we go in Christ our salvation is complete look at verses 11 and 12 it's kind of confusing
[time=1742] reading but I think we can make sense of it and in Christ you were also circumcised with
[time=1748] a circumcision made without hands and in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision
[time=1754] of Christ having been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised up with him through
[time=1760] faith in the working of God who raised him from the dead I told you it's kind of confusing
[time=1767] circumcision circumcision coming out of the Old Testament Judaism was this thing called
[time=1775] circumcision on the eighth day of a little boy's life he would be circumcised by his
[time=1782] father or by the priest or by whomever so that he could have an outside visible sign that he is a part of the nation of Israel it was an outward sign of participation belonging
[time=1794] to and hopefully ascribing in your heart to the values and the God and the word and
[time=1800] the truth that embodied what Israel was supposed to be about but over time it became an external
[time=1808] it became divorced from the real condition of the heart and pretty soon people were under the impression in the nation of Israel that all they had to do was to be circumcised externally keep some other external things and they were right with God and God was repulsed by that
[time=1824] in Leviticus 26 he's talked about their uncircumcised hearts and what he was saying was this circumcision
[time=1832] thing isn't just about the outsides you know some physical attribute of your body it is a circumcision of your heart whereby you surrender to God all that you are and you give yourself
[time=1843] to him in Jeremiah 4 4 he says to them circumcise yourselves to the Lord and remove the four
[time=1852] skins from your heart it's always been that way with God it was that way in the Old Testament
[time=1859] and it is that way in the New Testament now in the Old Testament there were additional outside things that he would try to have them do to show that like circumcision like
[time=1869] the sacrifices and the temple observances and the day of the feast and the festivals but it's never been anything with God other than a person's heart that's always been the issue
[time=1880] he says in Jeremiah 9 let not a wise man boast of his wisdom let not a mighty man boast
[time=1886] of his might let not a rich man boast of his riches you know as you look over the landscape of your life and you figure what am I proud of what do I want to lift up as my accomplishments how do I want to be known one of the things that I want people to recognize me for he's saying don't let it be your might or your rich your riches or even your wisdom he says
[time=1906] let him boast in this that he understands and knows me that I am the Lord who exercises
[time=1913] loving kindness and justice and righteousness on the earth for I delight in these things declares the Lord he says the real issue in your evaluation of yourself isn't your wisdom or your wealth or your might your power your prestige the one criteria ought to be that
[time=1929] you know me and that's enough for you that is like the hallmark of your life I know the
[time=1938] true and living God the one who exercises loving kindness and justice and then he says
[time=1944] this behold the days are coming declares the Lord that I will punish all who are circumcised
[time=1951] and yet uncircumcised speaking of the nation of Israel and he's saying you are the ones
[time=1957] who are boasting in your wisdom and in your might and in your riches you're not boasting
[time=1963] from your heart which is where boasting comes from in your knowledge of who I am and he
[time=1969] wants you he said I want you to know I'm going to punish you because while you're circumcised you're uncircumcised while you've got some religious observances in your life the real thing that matters to me has been left untouched namely your heart it's interesting to note
[time=1985] that Abraham the father of the nation of Israel the great one who God used to start this whole thing in motion do you realize that he was saved by faith Romans 4 tells us he was saved
[time=1996] obviously by his faith that's the only way anybody gets saved you never get saved by external stuff it's always by a faith expression from the heart to God you know how long it was before he got circumcised 14 years 14 years says in Romans 4 11 received the sign
[time=2013] of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while uncircumcised
[time=2022] in other words legalism wasn't enough then it isn't enough now it wasn't enough then
[time=2029] and it isn't enough now and so when false teachers come and try to evaluate you and
[time=2035] lift up false man-made systems by which you would evaluate your own spirituality don't even listen to them don't acknowledge them don't let them find have their way with you
[time=2047] you are complete and sufficient in your salvation by Christ because he is the one who has circumcised
[time=2054] you look at that verse 11 they come to you and say get circumcised you say to them I've already been circumcised you know what well yeah it's a circumcision that's not with hands
[time=2064] he's talking to Gentiles people whose traditions wouldn't have been to be physically circumcised
[time=2070] he's saying tell these false teachers you've already been circumcised but it's one that hasn't been made with hands it's not some minor surgery that somebody performs on somebody's
[time=2079] body I have been circumcised verse 11 by Christ I have the circumcision of Christ Christ has
[time=2087] cut away the foreskin of my heart in redemption in the way that he saved me in the Bible talks
[time=2095] all about the dynamics that occur inside of a person when they truly come to Christ and they're given a new heart and a new mind and a new spirit that's called a new orientation to life the circumcision which God is seeking is the circumcision of the heart which can
[time=2110] only be performed by the person of Jesus Christ in the act of salvation that's the only way to have a transformed heart that's all God's interested in and that's what he says you
[time=2122] are to tell these false teachers don't you understand the Lord has given you a new heart
[time=2128] now you say how do I know if I've been circumcised I mean like that how do I know if something has happened inside of me it's very simple you just ask yourself a very simple set of
[time=2139] questions what I really want to do with my life do I really want to live for God or do I really want to live for Satan what kind of behavior do I really want to fill my life
[time=2151] the deeds of righteousness or the deeds of sin I mean if you're here today and you find
[time=2158] that what you really want to do I mean you don't want to be here you feel restricted by being here you're kind of pressured into being here and you don't like the holiness thing that's going on around here and you don't like the standards that these people live by and you wish you can live a completely different set of values now there's a reason to question
[time=2175] whether or not maybe you've been circumcised of the heart by Christ because the Bible teaches that when you really come to Christ he circumcises the heart he he nullifies the removal of the
[time=2185] body of flesh by the circumcision of Christ as verse 11 says there's a radical transformation
[time=2192] of the individual and it is not merely external it is primarily the change of heart that comes
[time=2198] with conversion it's a wonderful thing you say well wait a minute you're making me nervous
[time=2205] because I still feel attracted to the things of the world I mean I can still feel tempted
[time=2211] to sin are you telling me that when I come to Christ all those temptations stop I no longer
[time=2217] feel attracted to or desires to be a part of the sinful things of this world no that's not what I'm telling you what I'm telling you is that there's a bottom line in your life and though you may be tempted and there you may have a weak moment and though you may fail to live up to the standards of righteousness as God presents them those are your weak moments
[time=2237] those of that and you you shudder at those thoughts and you're you're repulsed by that and you would shudder at the thought of that becoming the pattern of your life it's not really who you are yes you're still temptable yes you're still weak yes you're still fall back but in your sane moments you hate it you hate sin and you hate it when it finds
[time=2256] way into your life and that's the struggle that Paul talks about over in a different
[time=2262] passage you don't need to turn there but Roman 7 he says I know that nothing good dwells in me that is in my flesh for the wanting is present in me but the doing of the good is not you see the struggle he's in he's a man my flesh is this my humanness I still
[time=2278] get tempted I still see it I still want it I'm a fool I know there's no value there and
[time=2285] in my heart I want to obey God but I fall I stumble when he does stumble he says I know
[time=2292] I am no longer the one doing it it's sin that dwells in me because I joyfully concur with the law of God in the inner man but I see a different law in the members of my body waging war against the law of my mind it's hard to understand that but but the reality
[time=2309] is when you are truly circumcised by Christ not an external thing an internal change of the heart and the mind and the spirit the true compass in your life navigates towards God
[time=2323] and you may get deterred from time to time and you may be on that course and looking over and seeing some of the attractive elements that are out there and you may fall to them from time to time but that's not who you really are that's not really where you want to go it's different in your life because the circumcision of Christ you say well how
[time=2344] does that happen I mean how does he do that look at verse 12 how does Christ circumcised me when did all that happen I don't remember that verse 12 having been buried with him
[time=2355] in baptism in which you were also raised up with him through faith and the working of God who raised him from the dead now you say thanks for reading that I'm totally confused right I can't explain this either but here's what happens I mean I'll give you the best shot it's a miracle and miracles are always tough to explain but here's my best effort when you got saved God shot you back two thousand years and allowed you to die on the cross
[time=2381] with Christ and be buried with him look at it in verse 12 having been buried with him
[time=2388] in baptism that's the baptism of you into the body of Christ and also while you're there
[time=2395] he allows you to be raised up with him through faith so you not only died with him you not
[time=2401] only were buried with him but you were raised with him and that's as much as the Bible tells us about that but it is real it happened and it changed who you are it changed the inside
[time=2412] navigational system and you are now oriented towards God instead of towards sin and towards El how do that happen did I work for that that I earned that no look in verse 12 faith
[time=2425] it happened by faith faith in the working of God who raised him from the dead the whole
[time=2432] issue is done by God so do you understand how ridiculous it would be to say that there
[time=2439] is something that I could do by not eating something or by not drinking something or by
[time=2445] making sure I do certain things that could affect a salvation that is secure for me it is done without hands it is a circumcision of my heart and it accomplished it was accomplished
[time=2456] through a miracle of God by putting me back on the cross the death and the resurrection of Christ what are you going to add to that what are you going to do with that what part of that were you going to help with is the point none there's only one thing we get to do in that express our faith express our faith we we humbly express our faith in Christ that
[time=2477] all that will happen as the Bible tells us if we will just trust Christ in that exciting
[time=2484] nothing to be done nothing to be added salvation is complete number two forgiveness is complete
[time=2495] forgiveness is complete it is amazing to assume that any one of us or any person in general
[time=2502] could begin to think that they could do some certain ritual and thereby obligate God to
[time=2509] forgive them because it reveals a gross misunderstanding of how lost we really are apart from Christ
[time=2516] in other words any legalistic effort any self help effort any self works religious system reveals in total an impoverished understanding of the lost condition of a human being outside
[time=2527] of Christ and that's what he talks about here in verse 13 look at how lost we were and when you were dead in your transgressions and the uncircumcision of your flesh when you were
[time=2541] dead in your transgressions if you want to hold your finger right there and come to Ephesians two because these are parallel passages and Ephesians two expands on this a little bit and gives us some wonderful insight into how lost we were and this by the way is all a
[time=2557] part of being grateful to God on a regular basis I don't review this to make you feel bad I review this to make you feel good so that you can appreciate a new and a fresh just how
[time=2569] lost we were and how gracious God really is Ephesians two one he says and when you were dead in your
[time=2576] trespasses and sins the Greek word in there is in the locket of case which means that there is
[time=2582] this sphere defined as trespasses and sins it's like this space and I would like you to think of it
[time=2590] as a retail outlet think of it as to give more definition think of it as a footlocker
[time=2596] and you and I in our lost condition we are inside the sphere of footlocker but here it's the sphere
[time=2603] of trespasses and sins meaning we can go anywhere we want to inside that store but the doors are locked
[time=2609] and the back door is locked and the air conditioning vents are sealed off there is no way for us to go
[time=2615] anywhere but inside the confines of that retail outlet and everything in it is nothing but
[time=2623] sin and transgression now that's lost that is the state of the unsaid now they may do some nice
[time=2632] they may help an old lady across the street they may try to raise some money for a philanthropic cause but even that stuff the apostle or it says in the Old Testament even my even my works of
[time=2642] righteousness are as filthy rags because they're not done from a pure heart to honor God out of
[time=2648] gratitude for salvation so even the nice deeds are evil in the eyes of God because they are a
[time=2655] front to the work of Christ well it goes on look this is also how lost we were verse two
[time=2661] in which you formally walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air of the spirit that is now working in the sons of discipline who's that that satan satan is the prince of the power of the air and he sets up his demonic system in other
[time=2677] words he sets up the store it was his choice to make it a foot locker and he is the manager of the store and he markets his product unbelievably well he has false religious systems and paganism
[time=2690] and all kinds of overt products inside that store it's all trespass it's all sin different
[time=2696] flavors styles models colors it's all though the same stuff it's all shoes it's all sin and men are we good customers I mean we got our charge cards out look at verse three
[time=2709] among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh indulging the desires of the
[time=2715] flesh and of the mind and we're by nature children of wrath even as the rest you know what that's saying those are the two strongest words in the new testament to describe personal passion and desire lust and desires we are running around his store with our credit cards out charging up an
[time=2731] incredible debt as we spend and spend and spend as we consume consume consume
[time=2737] and we do it by nature it just comes naturally to us because of course we're born sinful
[time=2747] back to Colossians 2 for a minute what in the world are we thinking he's saying you see to assume
[time=2756] that by not eating certain foods and by not drinking certain drinks and by coming to certain
[time=2764] religious functions to assume that that is sufficient to extricate yourself from being locked up
[time=2773] in the sphere of trespasses and sins controlled and marketed by Satan himself as an avid consumer
[time=2780] is ridiculous there is no possibility for us to save ourselves through the legalistic efforts
[time=2791] of that system or any system I mean it just reveals a profound misunderstanding of how truly
[time=2797] and totally depraved and lost the human is without Christ and so God looks down at us
[time=2805] in this condition he sees us in this dead condition without hope and what does he do
[time=2812] I mean the whole idea of being dead means that you can't respond to it right when a person is dead
[time=2819] that you stick them with a needle they don't respond and the point he's making is the unsafe person is unresponsive to spiritual things spiritual truth the word of God spiritual reason spiritual wisdom repentance confession they don't huh I don't I don't feel anything I'm dead totally
[time=2839] lost condition God sees us in that and what does he do look at verse 13 middle of verse he made
[time=2846] you alive together with him having forgiven us all our transgressions that's amazing
[time=2852] God sovereignly chooses to give us life through the person of Christ and forgive us
[time=2859] what does it say there at the universe 13 he has forgiven us most of our transgressions he has forgiven us some of our transgressions you see and so then we have to add legalism to get
[time=2873] now what it says it says that he has forgiven us all our transgressions every last one of them
[time=2883] the ones we committed when we were two the ones we committed when we were 32 and the ones we will commit when we are 72 it is complete and total forgiveness in Christ all of our sins are forgiven
[time=2898] and no legalistic efforts can detract or add to that truth you say well how that happened
[time=2906] I mean how did I get forgiven for all my transgressions look at verse 14 and this is just amazing having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us now in the Greek
[time=2918] that's a very interesting phrase it means it means autograph in its like most primitive form
[time=2924] and then it goes from autograph to like a personally handwritten note and then later it took on the meeting of a personally handwritten note acknowledging debt
[time=2935] that is then signed by the individual it's a it's an ancient IOU in a very personal form and you see we're running around inside the store and we're charging it up
[time=2946] I mean we're committing a fence after a fence after a fence in the face of God and we now owe
[time=2952] him the penalty of which is eternal hell and we got it written down here it's our IOU and we finally
[time=2960] sign up to it our we did it ourselves we accomplished this debt we owe God payment for all this sin
[time=2968] verse 14 says that Christ came along and he did two things with it he snatched it out of our hands
[time=2977] and did the first thing he canceled out the certificate canceled it out you lose something in translation there and in the ancient days they would write on papaya and the ink they would use
[time=2988] had no acidic content and so it couldn't bite into the actual fabric and so it was for a long
[time=2996] period of time it was very easy just to take something moist and wipe off whatever had been written there and that's what that word says Christ yanks your personal IOU out of your hand the debt of eternal life that you eternal death that you owe to God and take something moist I would think his own blood and wipes the slate clean so it is no longer there it no longer can't be read the record is lost but if that's not enough look at verse 14 he then takes it out of the way having nailed it to
[time=3030] the cross he said give me this thing I'm going to wipe this thing clean I'm going to nail it right
[time=3036] here on this cross now you guys go ahead you nail me to that cross too and the only thing God can
[time=3043] see when he looks for that certificate of death is me Christ covers us with his own death first he
[time=3054] nails it to the cross and then he allows himself to be nailed to the cross so that the sin debt is covered and we are forgiven in total you want to go back to legalism you want to try to earn that
[time=3067] you want to try to you want to try to add to that do you want to try to do something to keep all that
[time=3074] don't you understand my friends it is completely beyond us we go from a completely totally dead
[time=3082] insensitive lost state locked up in the sphere of sin and transgressions aggressively pursuing the
[time=3088] things of the world but God makes us alive through the death of Christ
[time=3095] so there is total and complete forgiveness in Christ and Paul says to these legalists
[time=3104] he says to these dear Christians as they are forced to confront these legalists don't you listen to them for one minute you can't add you can't subtract it's all done in Christ you are
[time=3116] completing him quickly here and lastly number three we have complete victory we have complete
[time=3123] victory verse 15 when he had disarmed the rulers and authorities he made a public display of them
[time=3130] having triumphed over them through him let's go back to our analogy of the sporting good story there the footlocker it's satan inside doing his deal and he's got all of his demons in
[time=3141] there see that's rulers and authorities that's how the bible uses those two terms usually to describe the demonic host that fell with satan and so in our little analogy they're all like on the
[time=3150] inside and on the outside and they got the doors locked and they got it all framed up and they're watching us and we even get close to an escape which we wouldn't because we're totally delighted to be in there buying all that stuff but they are holding us there we were captive in there and what Paul says is man Christ resolved all that power and all that authority he made it
[time=3172] null and void when he disarmed them through his death he took away all their punch all their power it's as if he just came to the front door ripped it open and said okay now you you you you you're
[time=3184] coming with me i'm saving you you're born again and though now that we are saved and circumcised of
[time=3193] heart we can go past the storefronts and we can be enticed and we can see and sometimes we go in there
[time=3202] and we commit sin we always come out if you will they have no power to hold us sin has no power
[time=3212] death has no power and the demonic host has no power for one reason and one reason alone they have
[time=3218] all been disarmed by the person of Jesus Christ i love at the universe 15 it says he made a public
[time=3224] display of them having triumphed over them through him you remember in first peter 318 it says that
[time=3231] Christ went and made proclamation to the spirits now in prison the best we can understand that
[time=3237] is sometime after he was crucified and before he was resurrected Christ went and appeared to some of the incarcerated demons and and said very boldly and very plainly it's over it's all
[time=3249] over i won the penalty for sin has been made and i now get to redeem those who will call upon my name
[time=3259] in faith he did it publicly on the cross he did it publicly we believe in the realm of Hades and
[time=3266] hell and death with the incarcerated demons so it's wonderful isn't it just lifts Christ up
[time=3274] look again at verse 16 let therefore no one act as your judge don't let anybody point a finger at
[time=3282] you and question the reality of your salvation the completeness of your forgiveness and the absolute total victory which is yours because you are in Christ based upon what you might eat or what you
[time=3293] might drink or where you might go with respect to festival new moon and sabbath day don't even consider why verse 17 because those things are a mere shadow of what is to come the substance
[time=3307] belongs to Christ you get it all the full reality of what it means to be saved the substance belongs
[time=3316] to Christ well let me just wrap this thing up here i want you to notice one more thing from this
[time=3324] text and this really just says it we'll start in verse nine two words two words you'll see
[time=3331] them over and over again verse nine in him verse 10 in him verse 11 in him verse 12 with

[time=3388] [MUSIC]
