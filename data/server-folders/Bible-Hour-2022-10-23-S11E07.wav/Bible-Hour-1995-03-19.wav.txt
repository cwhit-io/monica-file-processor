[time=8] Is it a sin to smoke?
[time=9] Is it a sin to drink a glass of wine?
[time=12] What about dancing and R-rated movies?
[time=15] What does the Bible say about the Christian being involved in these kinds of activities?
[time=21] How can the Christian know whether to be involved in these things and how should he view those who are?
[time=28] These are the kinds of questions that come to the surface when discussing legalism and the gray areas.
[time=34] Stay with the Bible hour as Pastor Moore gives us 10 helpful questions to ask ourselves when facing a decision about a gray area.
[time=43] But now, let's join our service.
[time=60] She was born in radiant beauty on a day called Pentecost and given power from an eye to
[time=72] take and win the laws.
[time=76] By the times it seems her enemies were forced to retreat, still she stands undaunted for
[time=89] no one can defeat his glorious church, his precious bride, for you he can.
[time=102] Presenting you, how we glorify his glorious church, his precious bride.
[time=124] Though her beauty may be blessed by the failures of you, the one who died her with his blood
[time=145] will heal her first turn, at the word of God his pride will stand enduring everything.
[time=156] For even him will not prevail, she will rise again, his glorious church, his precious
[time=199] He will rise again, his precious bride will not prevail, he will not prevail, he will
[time=213] be blessed by his glorious church, he will not prevail, he will not prevail, he will
[time=233] not prevail, he will not prevail, he will not prevail, he will not prevail, he will
[time=269] rise again, his precious bride.
[time=284] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you and thank you for joining us on
[time=291] the Bible Hour today.

[time=297] The first is April 13th, we're having Steve Green in concert right here at Blackhawk Baptist Church, that's a Thursday night at 7.30 and if you're not familiar yet with Steve's ministry of music he's just a phenomenally gifted, godly young man who sings for the glory
[time=312] of God, it'll be a tremendous time of worship, you're all invited and we'd love for you to participate in this wonderful evening, that's April 13th, Thursday at 7.30, it's the kind
[time=324] of thing you could grab a Christian friend and say let's grab dinner and then enjoy this wonderful concert together, you can buy tickets at any of your local Christian bookstores and we invite you to do that.
[time=334] The other exciting event that's coming up is today actually, it's going to be Sunday,
[time=340] March 26, that's today at 9.10 and 10.50, we're having a special outreach service here at Blackhawk Baptist Church and the theme is conflict resolution, how in the world can
[time=351] we work things out inside of our relationships, it's going to be an exciting morning, a very unusual format, it's designed for those of you who might not regularly come to church,
[time=362] who might not know the Lord, we'd invite you to come and explore with us what God's word has to say about conflict resolution, so join us even today, will you?
[time=381] I believe in Lord Jesus, only be God and Son of God, I believe in Your Holy Spirit,
[time=408] give her a life, proceeding from the Father and the Son, all glorified, I believe Jesus
[time=431] came in the flesh, I believe in You, and saved by God, for just more, He converted, rose
[time=451] again, now His Kingdom has opened.
[time=457] Lord I believe in one body, born of Your Spirit, baptized in You, I'm looking for the resurrection,
[time=477] I've been forgiven to reign with You, I believe You will come again, Lord, to judge the boy
[time=494] of the dead, I believe I will live forever more, just like You said.
[time=524] Lord I believe in one body, born of Your Spirit, baptized in You, I'm looking for the
[time=550] one I've been forgiven to reign with You, I believe You will come again, Lord, to judge
[time=567] the boy of the dead, and I believe I will live forever more, just like You said.
[time=580] Lord I believe I will live forever more, just like You said.
[time=610] We'll return to the service in just a moment, but right now let me tell you about a free
[time=617] booklet the Bible Hour is offering.
[time=620] It's entitled God's Promises for Your Encouragement, a full compilation of the many verses from God's Word that offer encouragement, comfort, hope, rest, peace, and strength.
[time=631] Here are prayers and powerful nuggets from God's Word grounded in a powerful and loving
[time=637] God.
[time=638] We'll give you our address at the end of the program.
[time=641] Right now let's return to the service.
[time=644] The Bible gives us certain black and white behavior patterns which it says is sin and there's no question and there's no debate and there's no discussion on some of these things.
[time=655] It's always sin to lie, it's always sin to steal, it's a sin to cheat, it's a sin to use profanity.
[time=662] These are things which the Bible just speaks in black and white terms and there's no discussing it.
[time=667] The profanity issue for example Ephesians 4 says let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth.
[time=673] I mean that's pretty clear.
[time=674] Just never let it occur.
[time=677] There should never be cuss words coming out of our mouths.
[time=679] The word unwholesome means kind of vile and crude and gross.
[time=685] But as is typical of the New Testament it goes beyond what you're not supposed to do and says what you're supposed to do, but only such a word as is good for edification.
[time=693] In other words we're not just supposed to not say certain cuss words, we're not supposed to say anything whether you've used a cuss word or not that doesn't edify another person.
[time=704] The law is love and what we're supposed to do is use our mouths and our lips to articulate
[time=710] certain kinds of words that edify and build up one another.
[time=714] But those are black and white, it's a sin to lie, it's a sin to steal, it's a sin to
[time=720] commit adultery, it's a sin to cheat, etcetera, etcetera.
[time=724] And the New Testament has a number of lists and we could turn to them this morning we won't just for the sake of time, but there are different places in the New Testament where we could just read like command after command after command of what we're not supposed to do or what we are supposed to do.
[time=738] Those are just unquestioned issues of obedience to God.
[time=742] There's a second category though and these will call gray areas or disputable matters.
[time=749] And if you'd like to see a classic example of them, we're right here in Romans chapter 14, it'll get us into the discussion.
[time=755] These are things which are in and of themselves neither right nor wrong.
[time=759] The Bible never said thou shalt not.
[time=762] But they take us into areas or association with other areas that cause people concern.
[time=769] And really throughout the history of Christianity as it has developed in America, there is kind of a list, kind of a given list of do's and don'ts that the Bible doesn't teach, but
[time=780] which are lifted up to say that if you're going to be spiritual, if you're really going
[time=786] to be godly, that's not a matter of getting saved, now that you are saved, if you're going to prove yourself to be among the faithful and the true and the super spiritual and the super godly, there's kind of an unwritten list of do's and don'ts that shows up inside
[time=802] of Christendom, many, many, much of which does not happen inside the Word of God.
[time=809] And so let's kind of get into the argument here, Romans 14 verse 1, now it says, except
[time=816] the one who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of passing judgment on his opinions.
[time=822] Verse 2, "One man has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables
[time=830] only, let him who eats, let not him who eats regard with contempt, him who does not eat."
[time=840] Middle of verse 3, "And let not him who does not eat judge him who eats, for God has accepted
[time=846] him." Verse 4, "Who are you to judge the servant of another, to his own master he stands or falls and stand he will, for the Lord is able to make him stand."
[time=858] Before we start that's got to be my most favorite part there, that part where it says, "And stand he will." Why?
[time=865] Whether you're weak brother or a strong brother, stand you will, not based so much on those convictions, but the Lord is able to make him stand, I just love that.
[time=875] The power of God in salvation not only to save us, but to keep us.
[time=880] Verse 2, "One man has faith that he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats vegetables
[time=886] only." What are we talking about?
[time=888] In this particular day there were those who would have been raised in paganism, in an ungodly, paganistic religion, and they would have with their family from the earliest days
[time=899] of their remembrance gone to the temple and been involved in the temple worship.
[time=904] And inside that temple worship were a number of things that constituted what it meant to love God and be devoted to that God, not our God obviously, but a pagan God.
[time=914] And it would have been a number of things and some of them were as black and as dark and as satanic as your mind can possibly imagine.
[time=923] Much of it would have been revolving around temple prostitution and you would come to worship God and you would give and that giving, that money would allow you to have a sexual
[time=933] relationship with a temple prostitute, male or female, sometimes both.
[time=939] And your impression would be that you are now worshiping your God by giving your money and then having sex with someone who is not your wife or your husband.
[time=950] And the religious worship would go so far as at times to include human sacrifice.
[time=956] And babies would be brought, sometimes the baby of the very parents would be offered up and murdered, burnt, killed right there in that worship service and that too would
[time=968] have represented great worship to God and in the midst of all that there was eating and there was drinking.
[time=975] And there would be meat that would be brought and the best of the meat that would be brought to be offered to this pagan God and some of it would be burned and some of it would be left to be consumed in this great feast and festival and people would eat until they couldn't eat anymore and then they'd go throw that up and come back and eat some more and the drunkenness and just the absolute wicked debauchery that you can imagine was filled up in these temple worship services.
[time=1001] And by God's grace somebody in that group comes to Christ and they repent of all that
[time=1007] stuff and they say no I'm going to worship the true and the living God through Jesus Christ and the forgiveness that is mine in Him.
[time=1017] And so they become a part of a church and they get invited over to somebody's house by another
[time=1023] believer now and this other believer who is hosting this little dinner had no such background in paganism was never exposed to that stuff.
[time=1031] All they know is that some of the best meat in town can be bought at some of the best prices at the backside of that temple.
[time=1040] All the meat wasn't always consumed either burned or eaten and so it would be sold by those pagan priests.
[time=1047] And like any good Christian it's good meat and it's cheap so we buy it there, right?
[time=1052] This guy has no connection or fear or trepidation or memories of what might be connected to that he never been in there.
[time=1058] He has no concept.
[time=1059] It doesn't matter to him what goes on in there.
[time=1061] He just knows he's got a good product for a good price, buys it, brings it home.
[time=1064] He and his wife labor over it and they put it on the plate and here comes this dearly beloved couple that just repented from that whole pagan system and they through the course of the meal discover that this meat was bought at that temple.
[time=1078] And you can imagine the reaction this would be called the weaker brother.
[time=1082] The man who has faith that he may eat all things verse two that's the person who's hosting the party but he who is weak, he eats only vegetables, he not only can't eat that kind of meat, he doesn't want to eat any kind of meat because all meat reminds him of what was going on.
[time=1096] Takes him back in time and so this becomes clear and the weaker brother goes you've got to be nuts, I can't eat that, I could never, don't you know what that's associated with and the kinds of people that eat that kind of meat and the things that go on, you've got to be, I could never eat that and then here comes the legalism.
[time=1115] And by the way I don't see how you could either, what in the world do you think you're doing?
[time=1122] You're supporting that pagan system, this meat was in the presence of a pagan god offered
[time=1128] to him and the orgy and all the drunkenness, you can't be spiritual and buy meat from that
[time=1134] temple.
[time=1137] What does the Bible say?
[time=1140] There's what is being, that's the backdrop for these verses.
[time=1143] Verse two, one man has faith that he made all things, man, it's not bothering his conscience, he doesn't feel sinful when he does it, it's good meat, the other guy, he is weak and eats
[time=1154] vegetables only.
[time=1155] Verse three, here's the point, let not him who eats, regard with contempt, him who does
[time=1163] not eat, in other words the guy that's got the freedom, the guy that doesn't have that particular background that makes him special sensitive to that particular issue, he has no business looking at his weaker brother and saying you really aren't spiritual after all.
[time=1177] Maybe you're not even safe, if you are safe you really need to grow up, why can't you just read the Bible and learn what the Bible says that there is no prohibition against what kind of food we eat, we're free in Christ, we can eat anything he made and you're just really mitigating the wonderful work of Christ by not being free to eat.
[time=1193] That's out of bounds, that attitude is out of bounds, those words are out of bounds, that whole approach is out of bounds.
[time=1198] We are not allowed to hold and contempt the one who is weak and does not eat.
[time=1204] Also it says in verse three, and let not him who does not eat, the one who is weak and
[time=1211] does not eat, let not him judge him who eats, for God is accepted.
[time=1217] To the weaker brother who has certain convictions about these gray areas, that doesn't do this and doesn't do that, as true as it is to say that the stronger Christian can't hold and contempt the weaker Christian, the weaker Christian can't turn around and say you have no right to be involved in those kinds of activities, and this obviously indicates that you are either not committed enough or self-disciplined enough or godly enough, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1239] Because if you really weren't, if you really knew God's will for your life, you'd have the same personal standards that I do, and so therefore I judge you as ungodly, save
[time=1247] maybe, definitely ungodly out of bounds, that attitude can't exist.
[time=1256] Verse four, why?
[time=1259] Who are you to judge the servant of another?
[time=1263] To his own mastery stands or falls, and then of course this wonderful phrase, and stand he will, for the Lord is able, in other words, what business do you have trying to judge another brother's freedoms, because you don't know what his master has told him to do or not to do.
[time=1278] Those are oftentimes private marching orders that an individual saint gets from the Lord as far as freedom to eat or to drink, and seeings how we don't know what the Lord has said to that person.
[time=1288] We have no criteria upon which to evaluate his behavior, so it's back off, let it alone,
[time=1296] stay away from it.
[time=1297] Okay?
[time=1298] Now that's really safe in it, I mean that couldn't get any safer, because we don't have any temples in the town right now that are selling meat.
[time=1306] So this issue is for somebody else.
[time=1309] Now I'm going to be crazy enough to bring it into our particular day and age and talk about gray areas that really do face us.
[time=1316] And before I start, I want to say this, I don't want to offend anyone.
[time=1319] I don't want to belittle anyone's position, whether the strong or the weak, but I want to be very clear as to what God has to say to us from his word on this issue.
[time=1329] There was a time in our country, not too long ago, I know people who have told me this personally about their own experience, where it was considered a sin to have recreation on Sunday.
[time=1343] Not just not a good idea, not just unwise, sin.
[time=1348] And if on Sunday you came home and changed your clothes and went out and played softball or golf or ping pong or anything like that, you were in sin.
[time=1357] Not the interesting thing is the Bible never says that anywhere about Sundays.
[time=1362] They are never told to hold it without recreation.
[time=1366] Some of those same people who will not recreate, find themselves or put themselves in a more godly character by sitting around a table and eating almost constantly from the end
[time=1377] of the morning services until the beginning of the evening services.
[time=1380] And somehow that's more godly.
[time=1388] The Lord hasn't said anything about how we're supposed to handle Sunday.
[time=1392] So relax is what he's saying here.
[time=1395] If certain of you have freedom to go do that, play a softball game, God bless you.
[time=1400] If in your view there's freedom because your master, the same as mine, has given you freedom to be outside and to enjoy his creation and to have fun with other believers or in this particular maybe situation, reach an unbeliever, you're free to do that.
[time=1415] Because the word of God doesn't tell us how to treat Sunday in those terms.
[time=1420] If on the other hand you have no freedom for that and maybe the way you were raised gives you no freedom for that, we want to honor you to stay in that particular point of non-recreation
[time=1431] and not have a person feel judged by that.
[time=1435] There is just honor and respect going both directions.
[time=1439] Television, why take me for example?
[time=1443] There was a day when I was trying to continue to as I still am, trying to grow up in my Christianity about six or seven years into this thing where I really could not control myself and my television.
[time=1453] And I would watch way too much of the stuff.
[time=1456] And I would watch it late and I couldn't get up on time in the morning and be strong and healthy and fit and so I figured I got to get this thing under control, I'm going to win this spiritual battle and I'm going to stick that TV in my garage, which I did.
[time=1470] I picked it up and I put it in my garage and then I was spiritual, wasn't I?
[time=1474] I mean that changed everything.
[time=1476] Suddenly my TV was in the garage where I couldn't get at it and I had nothing to do.
[time=1482] And it really, I don't know, I know one thing very shortly thereafter as I began to congratulate myself for such a heroic movement and for such great things in the Kingdom of God.
[time=1491] I began to look at other people who did have their TVs in their living room and I began to judge them because I knew they had to be watching too much TV.
[time=1499] It had to represent laziness and sluggishness in their life and if they were as committed as I am and if they were going to do this Christian thing like I was going to do this Christian thing, their TV should be in the garage too.
[time=1510] All kinds of judgmental attitudes.
[time=1512] What I actually found out in the end was that I can watch TV in the garage pretty well.
[time=1518] I just got myself a chair, put it right there, plugged that sucker in and off we went.
[time=1526] And I was a hypocritical legalist.
[time=1532] Now thankfully by God's grace you learn a little bit about how this works and the issue
[time=1538] isn't the TV, that thing is not sinful.
[time=1540] God's Word doesn't say anything about a TV.
[time=1543] What it says is about me and a spiritual person can grow to the place where they have self-control
[time=1549] and discipline on that particular issue and if they don't have it they may want to put it out there but don't call that spiritual, call that I'm weak and I can't handle that part and when you see other people with a TV don't call them on spiritual, call them strong for their ability to do that if in fact they don't violate it.
[time=1569] There was a day when mixed bathing was considered sin inside the church.
[time=1572] Some of you may to this day still hold that as a conviction where it was sin for people of the opposite sex to put their bathing suits on and jump in a pool or go to the lake or
[time=1583] to the beach, long drive from here.
[time=1587] There was a day in the 60's obviously when Christendom was under big time attack and
[time=1594] his hair thing was everything, people were considered spiritual or unspiritual based upon whether or not the hair touched the ear.
[time=1602] I mean that was huge.
[time=1604] All kinds of colleges around the country said if you're going to come here and you're going to live a devoted life to Christ and if you're going to really consecrate yourself Jesus your hair cannot touch your ears and you go really okay show me and you just can't find
[time=1616] it.
[time=1617] Well you've got to avoid all appearances of evil.
[time=1618] Well that's about as broad enough to drive a Mack truck through.
[time=1621] I mean I happen to think that a blue pinstripe suit and a nice tie represents as much evil as a little hair over the ear because a lot of the evil in this world comes from the business establishment.
[time=1630] So who are we going to, I mean how do you figure that out?
[time=1635] But that became a false standard of, and for some of us today you see somebody with their
[time=1641] head shaved, oh skin head, can't be spiritual, certainly not a Christian.
[time=1651] You know what is that?
[time=1652] Tell me where it says that, show me, it doesn't, see that's the point, it doesn't say it.
[time=1657] Playing cards, for some people playing cards are anathema.
[time=1661] I mean it's like bringing Satan himself into the house because after all that playing card has a jack and it has jokers and that represents evil and more than that don't you understand where playing cards go and where they've been and where they come from and what they lead to and gambling and people gambling way more than they should.
[time=1677] How could a Christian, I mean a devoted Christian possibly bring that into their home?
[time=1682] Well that's not my experience.
[time=1684] My experience with playing cards are my fondest memories of family time.
[time=1688] You used to play a game called spit, which was changed from a game called heck, which was changed from a game called, I can't say it, we're in church.
[time=1695] It's where you go when you die and you don't have Jesus, they change it to heck and then they change it to spit and it was this weird game where you play it against your brothers and your sisters, in my cases only my sisters and you try to get rid of all your cards and it was just great family time.
[time=1709] One problem, I was never fast enough, I always lost which brought new sin into my life, hatred and anger and jealousy, but you see the sin was not in the cards, they're just plastic
[time=1722] with some ink on them and the Bible doesn't say anything about that stuff, it's just not to be found, it's not there.
[time=1730] There's the whole issue of movies and Billy Sunday not too far from here over at the tabernacle used to preach against ever darkening the doors of a movie house and you were in sin and the truly spiritual Christians didn't darken the door, I appreciate his vigor, I appreciate
[time=1745] his passion for holiness in my opinion, it's misdirected, the Bible doesn't say anything about movie houses or 35 millimeter film or celluloid or any of those things, it's just not there.
[time=1756] How can you say something is sin when the Bible doesn't say it's sin, see that's the point, it's a gray area, there is no definitive statement and people now will evaluate whether your spiritual or not spiritual, if you go to G or a PG or a PG-13 or an R or something and all kinds of values are being made there, why did I put this next one down, smoking?
[time=1779] Smoking, did you know that the Bible never says you can't take some weeds, wrap them
[time=1787] up in paper, stick them in your face and light them on fire, that's what it is, the Bible
[time=1795] never says you can't do that, just you can't find it, well people say hey you can't do
[time=1804] that, if you smoke you're damaging the temple of the Holy Spirit, well my friends, there's
[time=1810] another one of those things you can drive a Mack truck through, guess what else damages the temple of the Holy Spirit, living in LA, right, hey you got to breathe bad air, it's
[time=1822] like secondary smoke, you got to live where there's earthquakes and then there's floods and then there's riots, what are you doing, if you're a conscientious godly Christian you'd never live in LA, well who would reach the people who live in LA then, nobody would,
[time=1840] you know I mean if the temple of the Holy Spirit is the big thing what was Paul doing on all these missionary journeys, we're in 2 Corinthians 4 he said I have but an earth and vessel and
[time=1849] the point is it's not strong enough to house this treasure of the gospel and he goes on
[time=1855] in that chapter to talk about being persecuted and beaten and struck down and I mean he literally destroyed his body eventually ended his life by his faithfulness of the gospel, what kind
[time=1866] of a criteria, how do you apply this criteria, where does this come from, this seems rather arbitrary to me to isolate a few things in life that hurt the body but let a whole bunch
[time=1876] of them go like athletics, certain people you play football well you could blow your knee out that's a temple of the Holy Spirit, well you could be paralyzed, well then get out of your car because more of us will be injured in cars, I mean where does this go,
[time=1890] your temple is not the ultimate issue, so I don't like that argument as you can tell,
[time=1897] drinking, do you realize the Bible never says that you can't have a glass of wine or a beer,
[time=1905] it says in black and white terms that we are not to be drunk, Ephesians 5, drunkenness is a sin but that's all it says about that, the rest of the stuff you get is you see Jesus
[time=1918] making wine at a wedding and you see over in Timothy taking a little wine for your stomach sake and then we wonder what was that real wine or was that fake wine, was that deluded wine, was that strong wine, I don't know the Bible doesn't tell us, very difficult to come down in a dogmatic way as if to say that to have a glass of wine is sin or to have a
[time=1937] beer is sin because the Bible doesn't say it and so what happens is there are some who
[time=1944] have a liberty to do some of these things and the problem is then those people hold the people who don't have it in contempt and then the people who don't have the liberty to do these things hold the people who do have liberty and guess what happens, division inside the
[time=1959] body which is the sin, don't talk about sin, division in the body is sin and we'll get
[time=1966] back to that in a little bit. So we're kind of left in the freedom field if you will of
[time=1972] Christianity, how do we make the choices, how do we choose when we're confronted with
[time=1979] these kinds of decisions, what we're going to do and based upon that criteria how do
[time=1986] we relate to unbelievers. Well I want to give you ten questions this morning that you can ask and answer about any one of these categories and others that I might not have listed. Ten
[time=1996] questions that you can ask and answer about gray areas and each question is preceded by
[time=2004] like a word. So the first word is expedience and they all start with a letter E. Number
[time=2010] one, expedience. The question is will it be spiritually profitable? Will it be spiritually
[time=2017] profitable? First Corinthians 6-12, all things are lawful for me but not all things are profitable.
[time=2024] Now what does he mean when he says all things are lawful for me? Does he mean that it's lawful to murder, to commit adultery, to steal absolutely not? What he's saying is everything
[time=2037] that isn't said to be lawful is lawful. Everything that hasn't been prohibited is okay. All things
[time=2047] are lawful for me but not all things are profitable. Not all things are profitable. The word
[time=2056] some pharaoh for profitable. It means bringing things together for your advantage. You look
[time=2062] at your choice in this particular category and you say would doing this be to my spiritual advantage? Would participating in this particular thing accrue to my spiritual prophet? That's
[time=2076] how that. Watching this movie, seeing this television show, spending this amount of time doing this, dancing, whatever that issue is, will this be to my spiritual prophet? On the
[time=2088] other hand, just another question of this first one, will doing this tend to lead me into spiritual laziness or spiritual apathy or spiritual indifference? Okay. You ask that
[time=2098] question of yourself as you're facing an issue. Will it be spiritually profitable? Number two,
[time=2105] number two, edification. Will it build me up? Now this is akin to the first, it's a little
[time=2112] bit broader. The question is, will it build me up? 1 Corinthians 10, 23. All things are
[time=2118] lawful but not all things edify. It's the same thought. Again, all things are lawful. What
[time=2124] does he mean? The things that are not prohibited are lawful for me to be involved in. But do
[time=2132] they build me up? That's that word. It means the building of a house. And I think it has
[time=2138] kind of a long term flavor. The first question is kind of an immediate spiritual advantage thing. And my sense of it is, the second word would represent the law. You know, I'm over
[time=2149] time here, I'm going to be building a spiritual house called my life in Christ. Over time here I'm going to be making some choices about the kinds of materials I'm going to be putting into my life, the brick and the mortar and all that stuff. And these choices in the gray area, do putting these things into my life, build the kind of house that I want to have,
[time=2170] that I'm going to live in, that's going to become what I am and who I am. It says in
[time=2176] 1 Corinthians 14, 26, just to give you another couple of verses, "Let all things be done for edification." In 2 Corinthians 12, 19, Paul says, "We do all things, dearly beloved,
[time=2187] for your edification." So as we walk our way through some of these choices on these issues
[time=2193] in our life, we ask ourselves, "Will it be spiritually profitable?" Secondly, "Will it
[time=2199] build me up?" Thirdly, is the word excess. Excess, the question, "Will it slow me down
[time=2209] in the race?" "Will it slow me down in the race?" Do I really need this as a question
[time=2217] you might ask? In Hebrews 12, 1 says, "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
[time=2224] surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles
[time=2232] us and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us." So the Christian life is pictured as a race, agon, agion in the Greek, it's a long distance race, it's an endurance race and it's an agonizing race. It is one that is very difficult to run. It is not easy to run the Christian life. The question is, "Do these gray areas, whether
[time=2257] in or out of your life, do they represent a hindrance to your ability to run that thing
[time=2263] hard and long until you're done?" Now the verse, "Let us also lay aside every encumbrance
[time=2269] and the sin which so easily entangles." So there's two things in view. There's sin, that's the black and white stuff we've been talking about at the beginning of the message.
[time=2277] The encumbrance is obviously not sin. It's something else. It's the gray area stuff. It's
[time=2284] the stuff where we have freedom to do or not to do. And what he is saying is, is if these
[time=2292] gray areas are like you're running and it's like somebody puts the sweatsuit back on you
[time=2298] and then somebody puts a big overcoat on you and then somebody puts some boots on you and then you just go, "I can't run like this. I don't want to run anymore. I want to stop running this tires me out." Take that stuff off. Some of that is sin maybe and some of
[time=2314] it is the encumbrance. Some of that is the legal, is the gray area stuff. Get it off so you can run. Number four. Number four, the word is enslavement. Enslavement. Will it bring
[time=2331] me into bondage? Will it bring me into bondage? First Corinthians 6, 12. We already referenced
[time=2338] that but we'll do the rest of that particular verse. First Corinthians 6, 12. All things are lawful for me but I will not be mastered by anything. In other words, there are going
[time=2354] to be things out there that we can legitimately participate in without violating or committing sin but have an enslavement capacity to them that without them we can't function as normal.
[time=2370] There are some people who get themselves innocently into a routine of watching the same television,
[time=2377] three television shows every Thursday night and that is big and they just love it and it's just the way they do it and pretty soon that becomes even more important and even more important until really it's the priority in any given week and yeah they got to go
[time=2392] to work but I mean everything else is susceptible to being sacrificed what we're going to preserve
[time=2398] right here is this night and these shows. Does that qualify as being mastered by something?
[time=2405] There are people who get into a physical exercise routine to where man you know one thing they do every single day? They run their seven miles or they run their four miles or they do that
[time=2416] treadmill thing or they get to the gym and nothing gets in the way of that. They'll sacrifice time with the Lord, time with a believer, time with a family member. I mean there's just nothing as important as that. That's enslavement. Now that can happen in other categories. Some
[time=2432] of the more obvious gray areas. The question is will it bring me into bondage? Number five.
[time=2444] Excuse. Excuse. Question, will it hypocritically cover my sin? Will it hypocritically cover
[time=2455] my sin? This is a great verse. 1 Peter 2, 16 says. Act as free men. I mean there you go.
[time=2464] That's the charge. Hey look you're not saved by legalism and you're not sanctified by legalism.
[time=2469] You're free. Act like it. I mean just enjoy life. Just be liberated from all the do's
[time=2476] and the don'ts and the human opinions and all the stuff. Act like free men. But it says.
[time=2483] Do not use your freedom as a covering for evil. Use it instead as bonslays of Christ or bonslays
[time=2490] of God. In other words somebody could say hey look the Bible didn't talk about movies.
[time=2497] I can go to movies. I can go to all kinds of movies. I mean I can go to an R-rated movie.
[time=2501] I can go to a PG-13 rated movie. And I want to go to this particular movie because I love this particular genre. It's a western movie and I love western movies and besides that I love the actors that are in it. And as this person thinks it through allegedly in their own mind and articulates it to their friends I'm going to this movie because this particular genre this actor oh that's great. In their heart. In their heart. I really hope that
[time=2526] there's some racy scenes in this movie. I mean that's the real energy. See there's
[time=2533] a classic case of using true freedom in Christ. It's not a sin. The Bible doesn't say it's
[time=2539] sin. A person could do that. But there's another agenda right underneath the surface. And the
[time=2545] real agenda is man I hope there's this such and such in the show. You could use that in
[time=2554] a whole bunch of different examples. We struggled with it a little bit in California when it
[time=2560] was time to take our youth group to the beach. And here we were trying to get them together and build their relationships. And we were trying to build relationships with them and we'd even taught these kids how to evangelize and we're hoping that they would get some evangelism going. We were just thinking of it as a great day and that was the intention.
[time=2576] But eventually it became very very clear we're taking 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 year old guys
[time=2582] down to the beach where bathing suits are like synonymous with dental floss. I mean
[time=2588] there's nothing there. I mean it's ridiculous what they would masquerade in as a bathing suit. And pretty soon the counselors were being honest with each other and saying hey it's not good for us to be here it's hard for us. And if it's hard for us my lands is
[time=2603] this what we want? Oh there's freedom to go to be sure there is. Absolute total freedom and you should never judge anybody for doing that. But you be careful to look in your own heart and know why you're going and know if you're able to go and know if it's a positive spiritual experience. See that's what legalism does. It removes that kind of internal heart
[time=2624] to heart examination with God and with other people and just gives you a code. When you get into this kind of thing can't you sense you're not a constant dialogue with God and you're saying God I really want to be holy. What does it look like here? What does it look like here? Can I really do this? What's the real motive in my heart here? It promotes a kind of interaction among brothers and sisters where they can ask each other those kinds of questions. Because God is ultimately interested in your heart. That's what he's after. And
[time=2653] I think that's why there's so much out there that he hasn't said do don't do don't do don't do don't do don't do. And he wants it from in here. Number six. Number six is the word
[time=2667] encroachment encroachment. The question, will it violate my understanding of the lordship
[time=2673] of Christ? Will it undermine or violate my understanding of the lordship of Christ? The
[time=2680] second question that you would write down there is will it violate my conscience? Will it violate my conscience? This is very, very powerful and important truth in gray areas.
[time=2694] Romans 14, 22 and 23. The faith which you have have as your own conviction before God.
[time=2702] Happy is he who does not condemn himself and what he approves. You want to be happy? Live inside the boundaries of your own conscience. That's what that's saying. You want to be happy? Live inside the boundaries of your own conscience. Don't do things that even though the Bible may give you freedom to do them, don't do things that you don't have freedom to do by your own conscience. You'll be happy. Happy is the one who does not condemn himself and what he approves. It goes on. But he who doubts is condemned if he eats
[time=2729] because his eating is not from faith and whatever is not from faith is sin. It's more
[time=2735] than just wanting to be happy. The scriptures tell us that when you and I do things that may be permissible, there's no absolute against it. When you and I do things but we've got
[time=2746] a red light in our heads saying don't do that, don't do that, your conscience is speaking to you and you go ahead and do it. The Bible says that whatever is not from faith is sin.
[time=2756] What it means is the full faith, the assurance, not the faith that gets saved but the faith that do something in good conscience. Now this is a hard one. It relates to the person
[time=2768] who's kind of on the fence and they have read the scriptures and they see there's freedom
[time=2775] and maybe in some cases there's really been a legalistic past and they see how the legalism is impeding their ability to be in relationship with other believers, they're always judging them and I can't be comfortable with these people because they do things we don't do even though they're gray areas. Or maybe that same person is seeing the freedom in Christ but can't really get along with unbelievers because oh that's a whole other dimension.
[time=2801] That conscience needs to be educated. That conscience needs to be worked with by other
[time=2808] very mature believers. If you're in that category and you don't like your legalism and you see it but man it just runs so deep because of the way you were raised and you want to grow out of that weakness, you need to get in contact with a stronger brother, a stronger sister
[time=2822] who you really trust and begin to work through the life experiences and try to educate your
[time=2830] conscience. Very hard to do and it takes a lot of time. You see this is so strong because
[time=2837] the Lord wants you to make, your conscience is one of the most sensitive parts of your spiritual anatomy. And you start violating that thing a lot and it loses its ability
[time=2847] to be sensitive. And so as a result over time you can get involved in things that you wouldn't have otherwise done because you've violated it. That may be happened. Or then there may
[time=2858] be a process of true education according to the Word of God and just growth out of a weakened condition or a legalistic condition to a more whole condition in the legalistic
[time=2868] sense. Out of legalism into a more whole framework of Christianity. That's very difficult and
[time=2874] you're going to need help with that one. Number seven. Example. Example. Will it help
[time=2882] others, will it help other Christians by its example? I just looked at my watch. We've
[time=2888] got to go. Will it help other Christians by its example? Romans 14 verses 13 and 15.
[time=2895] Therefore let us not judge one another anymore but rather determine this not to put an obstacle or a stumbling block in a brother's way. In other words if you have freedom to do something
[time=2907] but if you're doing it in the presence of a brother that doesn't and it causes that weaker brother to stumble then give up your freedom. Be willing not to do that for the
[time=2916] sake of that brother whom you love. Number eight. Evangelism. Evangelism. Will it lead
[time=2925] others to Christ? Romans 14 now verses 16 and 18. Therefore do not let what is for you
[time=2933] a good thing be spoken of as evil for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. In other words be willing to give
[time=2943] up freedom if need be and maybe to exercise freedom where need be because the kingdom
[time=2950] doesn't consist of eating and drinking. It's not what it's about. It's about righteousness and peace and joy and what we want our unbelieving friends to see is just that. The righteousness
[time=2961] and the peace and the joy. We don't want to get in the way of that message. Number nine. Emulation. Number nine. Emulation. Will it be consistent with Christ lightness? The
[time=2974] way this is usually asked is would Jesus do it? When you're looking at a particular activity and you don't know whether to do it because the Bible doesn't speak definitively you say would Jesus do this? 1 John 2 6 is the scripture. The one who says he abides in him ought himself
[time=2989] to walk in the same manner as he walked. Walk like Jesus walked. Now this is tough because
[time=2995] a lot of times people have a misconception of Christ. In other words this can actually breed a sense of legalism rather than a sense of freedom because people they don't understand where Christ went and what he did. Remember he was called the friend of sinners. He went to the dark places in society. He's socialized with the alcoholics and the drug addicts and the prostitutes. I mean that was his stomping ground. He was more there than he was in the religious setting. So in order to really ask that question in an informed and helpful way you've got to know who Jesus is. You've got to really read and understand and not have some super spiritual criteria where anything you know boy oh he would have done that. Oh he would have done that. He would have done that. Well maybe he would have. You'd better get to know him. He penetrated the kingdom of darkness in the world but never of it.
[time=3042] Number 10 and this is kind of the suit and bode them. The one at the end. Exaltation.
[time=3047] Will it glorify God? Will it glorify God? 1 Corinthians 1031.
[time=3054] Rather than you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of God. Eating or drinking
[time=3060] or whatever you do. Do all of that to the glory of God. Let me just review so you know
[time=3068] you have them. Number one experience. Will it be to my spiritual advantage? Number two edification. Will it build me up? Number three excess. Will it slow me down in the race?
[time=3080] Number four enslavement. Will it bring me to bondage? Number five excuse. Will it be a
[time=3086] covering for my sin? Number six encroachment. Will it go against what I understand to be the Lordship of Christ in my life? Number seven example. Will it set a helpful pattern for others to follow? Eight evangelism. Will it lead others to Christ? Nine. Emulation.
[time=3103] Will it be like Christ? Ten exaltation. Will it glorify God? Now I wish I could stand here
[time=3109] and tell you that I was clever enough to come up with all these ten questions and a little ease you know. But I actually learned these from my mentor John MacArthur many many years
[time=3117] ago when we were at the Masters College trying to help young Christian students get a framework
[time=3123] to think through these decisions in their own life. So I want to just give him credit for that. Let me push this just one last second with you. It's very important. Come to the second Peter will you? Actually what we want is first Peter just as you're on your
[time=3145] way. Stop it first Peter. You say to yourself wait a minute I've been living my whole life.
[time=3152] I mean I got my spirituality kind of tied to some of the things you've been talking about.
[time=3158] I was kind of raised and said that people say hey you're spiritual if you don't do these things and you're not spiritual if you do do these things and you're saying okay I get what you're trying to say and I think you're right from the Word of God but tell me okay well then what is holiness? Huh? I mean what does constitute holiness and how do I evaluate
[time=3177] myself? How do I know if I'm growing in my walk with the Lord or if I'm walking backwards
[time=3183] in my walk? I mean what is the criteria if it's not do's and don'ts? Well the obvious
[time=3189] answer to that number one is it is God's do's and don'ts and if you're violating God's do's and don'ts you're going backwards and the true expression of love that God is the keeping of his commandments. But there's a second very very important to mention it's found in 1 Peter chapter 2. Look at verse 2 like newborn babes long for the pure milk
[time=3208] of the word that buy it you may grow and respect to salvation. This is not the only passage we could cite 20 or 30 passages. Here's the point you got some believers that are trying to grow their newborn babes. What constitutes real spiritual health and maturity and growth
[time=3225] in their life? Is it a list of man-made do's and don'ts? No. Look at the context. Verse
[time=3231] 1 therefore putting aside all malice and guile and hypocrisy and envy and slander. Guess
[time=3238] what all five of those words are? Those are all relational words that don't have anything to do with drinking or dancing or some behavior that is wicked or wrong except for behavior
[time=3250] inside the context of how one believer treats another believer. You want to know if you're
[time=3256] growing in Christ how loving are you to other believers? How self-sacrificing? Do you have malice? Do you have guile? Do you have hypocrisy? Do you realize you can have Christians who define their spirituality on the legalistic list of do's and don'ts and they keep every single one of those do's and don'ts but they are full of malice and guile and hypocrisy
[time=3277] and envy and slander. Legalism never perfects it never matures it never grows people in the
[time=3283] real issue of Christianity which is how I treat you and how you treat me. If you want a little more strength on that go up to chapter 1 verse 22. Since you have an obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren. That means since you got saved that's a fancy way of saying since you got saved to love the brethren the end of the verse says do it fervently love one another from the heart. You want to know what growth is? You want to know what holiness is? You want to know what God's going to evaluate you on more than any single thing? He said in Matthew 22 all the law even all my do's
[time=3316] and don'ts are summed up in relational maturity love God and love each other. So that is really
[time=3326] I think what we're after. Now some of us are going to not have freedom to involve ourselves
[time=3332] in some of these gray areas if it's based upon those biblical convictions as we're going through this and if it's short of then evaluating the rest of us in legalism we want to support you God bless you that's part of the unity. If there are others who have freedom to do
[time=3347] certain things and they can be done in good conscience as this list is reviewed then the
[time=3353] rest of us need to give them freedom to do that without judging them and saying no one
[time=3359] of these days you'll get spiritual one of these days you'll really grow I don't think I can trust you you do such and such you don't do such and such that's got to be gone that
[time=3370] stuff is divisive and bad and it also will obviously impact the way you relate to unbelievers.
[time=3376] Well those are very interesting questions that a person would ask themselves if they're
[time=3387] interested in living a life that honors God maybe there are some of you watching today
[time=3393] who want to honor God but have never felt you were worthy of that you don't know God
[time=3399] you're not in a personal relationship with God and you feel the guilt and the shame of personal sin and those questions just seem really far away but you'd like to get to a
[time=3409] position where you can begin to ask those questions about the choices you make in your life you'd love to live a life that honors God that begins by accepting Christ as your personal Lord and Savior that's where you pray and ask God to forgive you for your sins and put your faith in the person of Jesus Christ his death his resurrection for the forgiveness
[time=3429] of your sins I'm going to pray that prayer in just a moment to lead you if you so are so inclined I invite you to bow your head close your eyes and say in your heart to God what you hear me saying out loud and if you mean it from your heart God will hear your prayer and forgive you for your sins let's pray together Father I know that I am a sinner
[time=3451] I know that I have violated your law that I am worthy of death and Lord I am thankful
[time=3459] that I can learn about Jesus Christ the forgiveness of sins thank you for his death and his resurrection
[time=3465] I put my faith and his work on the cross for the forgiveness of my sins I thank you for
[time=3471] forgiving me in Christ and I pray this in Jesus name amen well that's a wonderful decision
[time=3478] to make and if you just prayed that prayer we'd love to hear from you here at the Bible hour in a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of lessons on assurance
