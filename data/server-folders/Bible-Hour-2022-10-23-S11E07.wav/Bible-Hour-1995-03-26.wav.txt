[time=0] (upbeat music) - Have you ever wondered why we tend
[time=9] to fight with each other so much?
[time=11] Relational conflict just seems to be a part of life that none of us can escape.
[time=16] It's everywhere.
[time=17] Well, today we'll be taking an honest look at conflict resolution.
[time=21] In the absence of any real training in the art of conflict resolution, most of us resort to handling conflicts the way we saw it handled in the homes we grew up in, even if that style wasn't very effective.
[time=34] So stay with us today as we evaluate our effectiveness in conflict resolution here on The Bible Hour.
[time=41] (upbeat music) [MUSIC - 223 seconds]
[time=286] (piano music) - Oh, they're getting ready to take the offering.
[time=300] Would you give me the checkbook?
[time=301] - You mean the checkbook?
[time=306] - Yes, give me the checkbook.
[time=309] - And you mean here, now?
[time=312] - No, I mean later.
[time=315] After the offering, that way I can walk up and give it to the preacher during his message.
[time=320] Of course I mean now.
[time=322] - Yes, well, all right.
[time=324] But remember, we're in church.
[time=327] Save your screaming until we get home.
[time=329] - Why would I want to scream?
[time=333] - Oh, you always scream whenever you look at the checkbook.
[time=336] - I don't scream.
[time=338] I cry.
[time=338] - Well, whatever it is that you do, you always make a scene.
[time=344] Just give me the checkbook.
[time=347] And I promise I'll remain very calm, no matter how many missing checks there are.
[time=353] - You promised.
[time=375] - Whoo!
[time=376] (audience laughing) - Dear?
[time=385] - Yes.
[time=388] - Where are checks 943 through 951?
[time=395] - I was hoping you would know.
[time=399] - You mean that!
[time=400] (audience laughing) (audience laughing) - You mean there are nine checks?
[time=410] Listen!
[time=410] - No, dear.
[time=413] They're not missing.
[time=415] Somebody has them.
[time=417] (audience laughing) I just don't remember who.
[time=420] - And what about check 958?
[time=423] - Oh, that one.
[time=425] I think that one was to the paper boy.
[time=427] - Well, at least you remember that one.
[time=429] - Well, it was either the paper boy or the house payment.
[time=435] (audience laughing) - And what's this?
[time=438] You wrote a check to Sears for 3298, but you only deducted 1298 from the balance.
[time=446] - Right.
[time=446] I made a $20 deposit that I purposely didn't record.
[time=451] (audience laughing) - This may sound stupid, but why would you do something like that?
[time=465] - Well, that was so I could buy a new dress, and it wouldn't seem like I was spending any money.
[time=470] - But how can you balance our account like that?
[time=474] - Balance?
[time=475] Now, why would I want to do that?
[time=477] I'm not an accountant.
[time=479] - Never mind.
[time=480] What about check 973?
[time=483] - Oh, it's there.
[time=484] Look, see?
[time=485] - No it isn't.
[time=487] You just have a question mark here.
[time=489] - Well, I know that, silly, but look, right here, I deducted $25 from the balance.
[time=495] - Oh, I see.
[time=496] You didn't remember who it was written to, but you did remember how much it was for.
[time=500] - Well, not exactly.
[time=507] - Well, you see, when I can't remember who I wrote the check to,
[time=513] what I do is I take $25 from the balance.
[time=516] Now, the real amount is either more than $25, or it's less than $25.
[time=523] You know, it all evens out.
[time=525] - But what if you write down $25 and it's really for $100?
[time=530] - Oh, well, that's where my cushion comes in.
[time=534] - Cushion?
[time=535] - Yeah, you know, that's where the deposits that I didn't record, or, you know, those voided checks that I forget to add back into the balance.
[time=544] - You've got to be kidding.
[time=547] Do you know how ridiculous this is?
[time=550] - You promised you wouldn't get mad.
[time=552] - Well, how am I supposed to write a check for the offering when I don't even know how much money we have in the bank?
[time=558] - Dear, we're in church.
[time=561] Just have a little faith.
[time=563] (audience laughing) - Hi, my name's Russell Moore,
[time=575] and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour today.
[time=578] I also want to say, am I glad you've joined us today because the subject matter is absolutely critical.
[time=584] We're going to be talking about conflict resolution and what the Bible has to say about how to handle conflict in the home, within families, and primarily within the marriage.
[time=595] But really, the principles from God's Word don't just have to relate to marriage.
[time=600] It could relate to relationships at work or where we have recreation, wherever we know people.
[time=605] It's exciting material, it's life changing material.
[time=609] If you're having any struggle at all with the relationships in your life and you're confused and want to know how to solve that problem, stay with us today and enjoy this message from God's Word.
[time=617] (gentle music)
[time=633] [MUSIC - 211 seconds]
[time=865] (gentle music) - Well, one thing's for sure,
[time=873] what we don't need is a multi-million dollar grant from the federal government to conduct a study to confirm the fact of relational conflict.
[time=882] It's everywhere in our lives.
[time=885] We go to work and we find that there is conflict between the employer and the employee and vice versa.
[time=892] Employees, coworkers are at each other's throats.
[time=895] We've got problems with the customer.
[time=897] We've got problems with the supplier, the manufacturer.
[time=900] I mean, conflict is a way of life inside the workplace.
[time=905] We come home and head into our housing tracks and just driving down that particular street reminds us that the person who lives in this house is in conflict with the person who lives in that house because this person built a chain link fence and that's not allowed in this housing track.
[time=920] The association is at odds with the city or the county depending upon what prevailing wind may be blowing with regards to developments upcoming.
[time=930] We find conflict in the classrooms and on the playgrounds of our schools, we find conflict in the aisles of our markets, the parking lots of our restaurants, the hallways of our city and county offices, the waiting rooms of our doctor's offices and even in the foyars of our churches or the parking lots of our churches.
[time=947] Conflict is everywhere and sadly and unfortunately, but honestly, conflict finds its way somehow into our homes and even into our marriages.
[time=960] And many of you could testify this morning that the hottest, most intense, most painful points of conflict in all your life are right there in your marriage relationship.
[time=973] And it's staggering.
[time=974] I mean, it's insane.
[time=976] Why does it have to be this way?
[time=978] Two people look at each other, find each other attractive, get the courage to ask each other out, start the whole dating courtship thing are together months, years and say, "Hey, I love you, you love me.
[time=993] "Let's do this thing the rest of our life." They entered into it with information, they entered into it freely.
[time=1000] I mean, it should be the one place in all of life where the conflict that so marks the rest of society should be shut out, right?
[time=1008] I mean, isn't this the one place we ought to be able to shut the doors, pull the blinds and have peace and harmony inside the home and especially inside the marriage relationship?
[time=1018] I think one of the greatest tragedies in our society
[time=1024] is that we allow people to get married without mandatory conflict resolution lessons.
[time=1031] Because you and I both know, having been down this road just a little ways, we see these starry-eyed couples, they're overdosing on infatuation, they can hardly wait to get married, they're gonna get married, but you and I know that soon reality will set in their marriage relationship.
[time=1049] And whether it's the first day as Tim's example, at the beginning of the service pointed out or whether it's a month or a half a year or 12 months, conflict is inevitable, it's coming.
[time=1061] And I wonder why in our society, we don't offer or rather make mandatory some type of conflict resolution training so that this young starry-eyed couple would have half a chance when the winds of conflict begin to blow.
[time=1077] In the absence of that training, I have found that most couples try to resolve the conflict in their marriage by the same means or principles they saw in the home in which they grew up, by their parents.
[time=1095] And so the conflict arises and one couple or one person in the marriage tries to resolve an Eskimo style.
[time=1102] That's how they saw it happening.
[time=1103] What's Eskimo style?
[time=1104] Well, the conflict erupts, but then we never talk about it.
[time=1109] Everybody backs off, slowly detaches themselves, tries to pretend the problem never really existed in the first place, sort of negotiates their way around the house as if, huh, is there a problem?
[time=1121] I don't know about any problem.
[time=1123] Do you know about a problem?
[time=1124] Hoping that over time, the situation will thaw out.
[time=1129] And oftentimes it does until the next conflict arises and surely the next conflict will arise because the Eskimo approach to conflict management never really deals with the real issues involved.
[time=1144] Nothing ever really gets talked about, nothing ever really gets resolved.
[time=1148] And so conflict comes after conflict comes after conflict comes and pretty soon a deep freeze begins to kind of find its way into that home and into that relationship and everybody's crusty, frozen hard and nobody's intimate and nobody can really talk and nobody can really share in the joys of what should mark a marriage relationship or a home.
[time=1173] That's how you saw it happening in your growing up years and without any training when conflict arises in your home more often than not, you revert back to the only kind you've ever seen and you do the Eskimo thing.
[time=1185] Despite the fact that you don't like what you're seeing, you're seeing the same effects, the deep freeze is moving in on your family, you wish there were another way, you don't know of another way, so you just kind of stick to your Eskimo guns and the family freezes over.
[time=1203] Well, speaking of guns is another way to kind of manage conflict that some of you grew up with, it's called cowboy style.
[time=1211] Cowboy style, the problem arises, the conflict hits and somehow, some way, the two people just seem squaring off like in the middle of a dirt street in an old western town somewhere and people begin to start drawing and they start shooting bullets, verbal bullets at each other.
[time=1229] It's as if to say this town ain't big enough for the two of us and we'll just have it out right here and the louder the better and they begin to shout and name call and mimic and become sarcastic and dredge up things from the past.
[time=1243] Oh man.
[time=1244] And things get said that should never have been said and the things which have been said cut so deeply that those wounds and those scars may never really heal
[time=1258] and it hurts.
[time=1261] And so if you live in a cowboy style home, you do the only thing you can, you go out and get yourself a bulletproof vest and everybody starts padding up and everybody starts getting these layers and pretty soon, you know, sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never hurt me and everybody's just as far away as the other person as they can because they know if they let the guard down, if they drop the bulletproof vest, just about then, there'll be another firefight in the middle of their home and they're not up for being shot at again and that stuff just hurts too much.
[time=1295] Once again, the real issues in that conflict are never resolved.
[time=1299] Good constructive conversation never goes on.
[time=1303] The real issues are never honestly looked at and dealt with but that's how you saw it so that's how you do it.
[time=1312] You grew up in that kind of a home and so that's exactly how you're trying to handle the conflict in your home even though you don't like the product.
[time=1322] You don't like seeing everybody put on their bulletproof vests.
[time=1325] You don't like the sense of distance that's creeping into your home.
[time=1329] You wish it were close and intimate and joy-filled and honest but one fight leads to another and without any other options, it just seems to go on that way.
[time=1343] Others of us grew up in homes where conflict was handled through escapism, escapism, the problem erupts, the conflict arises and dad goes out and gets drunk or mom goes out and gets drunk or somebody heads out with a charge card for a spending spree or somebody starts using drugs or somebody just says I had enough and walks out the door and doesn't come back for a day or two or a week or a month.
[time=1377] So all the attention gets shifted off the real issues in this conflict and it gets shifted over to the escapism, the alcohol or the drugs or the debt that the family now has which is even adding to the conflict problem in the family.
[time=1392] The attention gets shifted to the fact that dad hasn't come home or mom hasn't come home.
[time=1399] And if any progress can be made on those fronts,
[time=1405] people seem satisfied.
[time=1407] Well, at least dad's not still drunk or at least the drug problem seems to be under control or at least that person came home.
[time=1413] But once again, the real issues underneath that conflict are never dealt with, they're never talked about, communication never really happens.
[time=1422] And so members of that family begin to tread the root of their escapism more often or they find more socially acceptable roots of escapism but the distance still comes.
[time=1435] People are still far apart.
[time=1440] That's how you got raised and now that you're in your family though you hate it and wish it could be different and you see the negative impact it has on your family, you resort to it.
[time=1450] Some of you grew up in homes where the conflict was managed by manhandling one another.
[time=1458] You know the phrase violence breeds violence.
[time=1463] It's a true statement.
[time=1464] Calamity strikes, the frustration rises, anger boils and in those moments when emotions are screaming for something to be done with the raging conflict, a person merely responds reflexively with the only form of conflict resolution he knows and he strikes someone without even realizing he possessed the capacity to do it.
[time=1484] Manhandling one another.
[time=1488] The frustration grows to a level that the only way it seems in this person's mind to handle it is just a strike.
[time=1498] You wanna talk about damage and you wanna talk about pain and you wanna talk about scars that don't go away.
[time=1503] And I would just pause here for a moment to say that if you are in a home where there is violence, please, please get help.
[time=1511] Do not go on in silence.
[time=1513] Open a window, open a crack a door, somehow let somebody know what's going on inside your home and get the help that you need.
[time=1521] Needless to say in the manhandling one another form of conflict management, the real issues never get discussed.
[time=1529] The conflict never gets a chance to really be productively handled and people live in fear and isolation.
[time=1538] Well, in all of those aforementioned options, spouses continue to inflict deep hurts on one another, issues continue to go unresolved and casual decounts continue to rage higher and higher.
[time=1556] I don't know if you found yourself in one of those descriptions today or if you're maybe a hybrid of a couple.
[time=1561] But I'm hoping that you've come to a place in your life where you're really ready to consider another option.
[time=1569] I mean, you know where you are in that stuff.
[time=1573] You know what it's doing to your life and to the life of those you love.
[time=1576] And if you could just be convinced, if you could just be shown, if somebody could just hold out a ray of hope that there's another way to deal with the conflict in your home, you might be willing to give it a shot.
[time=1589] Well, I'd like to hold out another option this morning to you.
[time=1594] It doesn't come out of my own head.
[time=1596] It's not something clever that I've dreamed up in my own mind.
[time=1600] It really doesn't even come out of the contemporary day of thought on conflict management.
[time=1606] It comes right out of the Bible.
[time=1610] And I know what you might be thinking.
[time=1611] This book is like several thousand years old written about people that you don't even know about.
[time=1617] What in the world would it have to say to we who live in Fort Wayne in the 20th century?
[time=1621] Especially about conflict resolution.
[time=1625] Well, I'd like you to give it a try this morning.
[time=1628] I'd like you to just, for a moment, consider what the word of God, the Bible has to say about how to resolve your conflicts and see if it doesn't make sense to you and if it wouldn't be worth a try.
[time=1642] I'll never be able to in my life.
[time=1644] I don't guess say all that the Bible says about conflict resolution, but I try to just come up with four of, what might be the more important principles.
[time=1653] Four of the more important truths that this book has to say about how to manage conflict.
[time=1659] And in the time remaining, please allow me to share them with you.
[time=1663] Number one, resolving conflict in the marriage relationship or in the home begins by resolving conflict with God.
[time=1681] You see, the Bible says that every human being that we've managed to chalk up enough of our own mistakes morally and spiritually and relationally, that have violated God's standard for our life.
[time=1699] And as a result, there exists relational conflict, not just with the spouse or the kids or the people at work, but most importantly, in a relationship with God.
[time=1709] Because we have all fallen short of the behavioral standard of the holy God, there is conflict in our relationship with God.
[time=1716] And some of you are sitting here today and you could stand up and say that is a true statement.
[time=1722] I don't know where he got it, but it's true.
[time=1725] Because I look at my life and I know that there's a sense of uneasiness in my heart.
[time=1730] There's a restlessness in my heart when I think about God.
[time=1735] I know that things are not right between me and God and it disturbs me.
[time=1740] And I even sometimes struggle with a fear that I will eventually be held accountable and be punished for the ways that I have dishonored my relationship with God.
[time=1752] And it's there and it's real and you know it's there.
[time=1755] Working hard at times not to have to think about it,
[time=1761] but you can't always block those thoughts out.
[time=1763] And it's there.
[time=1767] You say, what in the world does my relationship with God have to do with my relationship with my wife or my husband?
[time=1774] And I wanna say everything, everything.
[time=1779] When you have conflict with a significant other, you know and I know you bring that with you everywhere you go.
[time=1786] You may be at work and have a major relational blowout with somebody at work, maybe it's your boss, maybe it's a key employee, maybe it's a critical customer that you've got to maintain and that whole thing may fall apart.
[time=1798] Yeah, you get in your car and you shut the door and you drive 25 minutes home, but what came with you?
[time=1807] All the tension, all the pressure, all the nerves, all the emotions of that relationship and you walk in the door and your wife, though she may not even know the people who have have been involved in this conflict with you, she may bear the brunt of it or your husband may bear the brunt of it or your kids may bear the brunt of it.
[time=1825] That's just what it means to be human.
[time=1827] You just can't shut that stuff off and leave it over there in a compartment.
[time=1830] It invades all the other relationships of your life.
[time=1834] That exact same thing is true, even more so with your relationship with God.
[time=1839] The Bible says that is your most significant other relationship, your most important relationship.
[time=1845] And when the account is unsettled and when you know that you're in conflict with God on the way you're leading your life, you can't just leave that like over in a religious corner of your life somewhere.
[time=1858] It comes with you everywhere.
[time=1860] It invades all of your relationships that puts you on edge in those relationships.
[time=1865] The good news that the Bible says
[time=1871] is that God has already taken the first step to resolve that conflict.
[time=1876] It lets us know that it really is up to God to take that first step.
[time=1882] You recognize that it would be futile to sit here this morning and say, okay, I gotta get my relationship with God, right?
[time=1887] How am I gonna do that?
[time=1888] All right, I promise from this day forward I'll never commit another mistake morally, spiritually, or relationally until I die.
[time=1895] Oh, my lands.
[time=1897] We might have trouble keeping that, trying to get out of the parking lot here today.
[time=1901] I mean, that's impossible.
[time=1903] It's also impossible to say, I'll tell you what, all those past mistakes, I'll just make up for all those, somehow I'll just make up for all those.
[time=1912] You can't, those are history and history's history and what's been done has been done.
[time=1917] The kind of the bad news here is that there's nothing we can do to fix that relationship with God because we have been the offending party and we've offended him so badly.
[time=1928] The good news is he's already taken a first step and because of his first step, there's hope for us.
[time=1936] The first step that God took in putting our relationship back together was to offer his own son as the sacrifice for our mistakes and our sins.
[time=1947] To say, I know you can't change history and I know you can't live perfectly the rest of your life.
[time=1952] You're just stuck with what you are.
[time=1955] And so what God did was God provided for our weaknesses and our sins and our violations of that relationship so he could give us forgiveness through the person of Christ.
[time=1965] It's an amazing thing.
[time=1967] It's as if we're over here and God's over here and what separates us is this great chasm of our own sin all the times we violated him.
[time=1977] And Christ becomes this beautiful bridge that God has built, the forgiveness of our sins and allows us to cross over an otherwise impassable chasm to cross over on the bridge of Christ and be put back into a perfect relationship with God, forgiven as the songs have said today.
[time=1997] It's an amazing thing.
[time=2001] You say, what does it have to do with my marriage?
[time=2004] Well, let me put it to you this way.
[time=2005] Not only does God, when you commit your life to Christ and go across this bridge through faith, accepting Christ as your Savior, not only does he forgive you for what you've done, but he puts his spirit inside of you.
[time=2016] And that Holy Spirit begins to work on your heart and it begins to make relational harmony a priority in your life.
[time=2026] I know in my life, before I committed my life to Christ, I didn't care one bit about relational friction.
[time=2034] It was no big deal to me.
[time=2035] It was no problem.
[time=2036] You don't like me.
[time=2037] You're mad at me.
[time=2038] You've got a problem with me.
[time=2040] That's your problem.
[time=2041] You can either get over your little issue and be my friend or just get out of my life.
[time=2048] I think a lot of us are that way.
[time=2052] We say it different ways, maybe a little more socially.
[time=2054] Once the Spirit of God comes into a person's heart, there is in a great exchange.
[time=2061] A spirit of rebellion is exchanged for a spirit of reconciliation.
[time=2066] And all of a sudden you'll find that one of the, if not the most important things in your life is that you are in relational harmony with your spouse, with your kids, with the important people in your life.
[time=2077] Without the working of the Spirit of God in your life, I find, I find in marriages where they are not reconciled to God, they haven't made things right with God first.
[time=2089] That some of the most insignificant problems issues for marital conflict just continue to grow and grow and grow and grow because each person has this little spirit of rebellion inside of there.
[time=2103] And before time is too far down the road, what could have been resolved very easily has become an insurmountable issue and that marriage is deteriorating and on its way to divorce.
[time=2114] The issue really was never the problem.
[time=2117] It was the attitude inside that husband's heart.
[time=2121] It was the attitude inside that wife's heart and maybe you sense that in your spouse and in yourself.
[time=2128] Maybe you've been in those heart to heart conversations and you know as you think it through, it's not really the issue that we're fighting over.
[time=2135] It's my attitude that will not allow us to reconcile to each other.
[time=2140] It's his attitude that will not allow this.
[time=2143] God changes that.
[time=2146] When you get reconciled to God by committing your life to Christ, the relationship with God is made right and then he begins to change your heart and your attitude which provides the framework for real conflict resolution.
[time=2162] I've seen some married couples who have committed their life to Christ overcome some of the most amazing obstacles that you can imagine.
[time=2173] Things that should have blown their marriage apart tremendous violations in their relationships and yet it's put back together because the spirit of God works in their heart and gives them an attitude or a spirit for reconciliation.
[time=2188] There is hope there.
[time=2192] And I don't know what level of struggle you have today.
[time=2194] I don't know how far gone you think your relationship is.
[time=2197] I mean, it may work on the outside and people may look at it and say they have a nice relationship or it may just be obvious to everybody that your relationship is falling apart.
[time=2206] I don't know how far it's gone but I'm telling you that by the power of God, according to the Bible, if you will get your heart right with God through Christ, his spirit will come into your life and it will begin to change your attitude and before long you will want reconciliation and you'll find it.
[time=2226] I'm gonna go on to these other three points this morning
[time=2232] that I want you to know before I do that without that first one being taken care of, these others may not be as helpful to you.
[time=2238] But just so you'll know what is out there.
[time=2242] The second principle that the Bible gives us in conflict resolution is this, process the problem privately.
[time=2250] Process the problem privately first.
[time=2255] In other words, before you shoot off at the mouth or begin to engage your spouse in trying to resolve this problem, take some time by yourself and take a good long look at you.
[time=2266] You've probably heard these words, they're familiar, often quoted words of Jesus.
[time=2271] Basically he said this before you go around trying to pick a little speck out of somebody else's eye, before you fix a fault in somebody else's life, make sure you don't have a two by four in your own.
[time=2285] And it's kind of this powerful imagery, this little person has a speck and you get this huge two by four.
[time=2289] Who are you to be fixing the other person's problem?
[time=2292] Boy, that's really important counsel.
[time=2296] The Bible invites you in conflict resolution to take a long walk with God, to sit down for a moment in a quiet place, maybe pick up a pad and a pencil and journal for just a moment about what's really going on in this particular point of conflict, to spend some time in prayer with God and ask that Holy Spirit to point out to you the things which you have done to make this conflict happen.
[time=2325] Even as the drama showed us this morning, that can be a matter of perspective.
[time=2329] And if you're not really sensitive to your own part in the deal, it makes conflict resolution nearly impossible.
[time=2337] Well, I was reminded of that just two weeks ago.
[time=2341] Remember this beautiful weather we had, I mean it was just stellar weather, we were in the 70s day after day, Monday and then Tuesday and then Wednesday and I was afraid it was all going to go away and I wasn't going to get a chance to kind of do something with it.
[time=2353] I was noticing that my relationship with my wife had gotten a little cold and boy, we just weren't happening like I like us to happen and so I thought, you know how about I just, how about I just take her for a ride out in this beautiful weather, the 70 degree I could just see us on this little motor scooter or motorcycle heading out somewhere in the country for a lunch at a restaurant, just wouldn't that be nice?
[time=2375] So I called up a friend who had a motorcycle and he unwisely gave me permission to borrow his motorcycle.
[time=2381] And then I called up a friend who could possibly do the babysitting and got her all lined up, got it all worked out and then finally just so excited, I called my wife and said, "Hey, tomorrow, listen." I cleared my schedule for an extra hour at lunchtime and I just, I'll tell you what, so beautiful, how about we just take a ride and we'll just spend some time together.
[time=2402] She said, "Great." I said 11.30, she said, "Great." The next day, I mean, the big day, I'm working on things, calling the babysitter, making sure and then all this and that and I go home at 11.30 and there's no Heidi.
[time=2415] I figure, well, she'll be right along.
[time=2419] I got my bike, got the helmets, got some cash, no right where we're going, she'll be right along.
[time=2424] 11.45, she'll be here soon.
[time=2427] 12 o'clock, where in the world is that idiot woman?
[time=2433] (audience laughs) What in the world does she think she's doin' standin' me up?
[time=2440] I mean, I set this whole thing up and she, what what?
[time=2442] She's shopping?
[time=2444] She's so unorganized, she can't get her day straight to be here at 11, she forgot?
[time=2449] What, and no message, I mean, would it have been so hard to pick the phone up and give a little word?
[time=2455] Which reminded me to check our answering machine.
[time=2458] (audience laughs) And there it was, that flinking light that tells you you've got messages.
[time=2463] Hi, honey, it's Heidi, it's about, it's about 11.15.
[time=2467] I'm still here at the doctor's office with our son, Bobby.
[time=2469] He's got some problems, they're backing up.
[time=2471] Well, I'm really sorry, I'm gonna be late, but I'll be there as soon as I can.
[time=2474] I shut the thing off.
[time=2476] (audience laughs) You get it, I mean, she didn't have anything to do with this potential conflict.
[time=2483] It was all on my side of the equation.
[time=2485] She's blameless, you know, that's just a classic example.
[time=2491] I mean, I could go into more, but it'd be too embarrassing.
[time=2493] But you know, where I'm just ready to tell her this is all her fault.
[time=2499] If you really cared about us, if you were thoughtful, if you were to organize, what's my job?
[time=2504] (audience laughs) You know, God just gives us the advice right here in His word, hey, take a look at your own eye first.
[time=2512] Maybe you got a two-by-four in there.
[time=2514] So many times I know I do.
[time=2517] And you know what happens?
[time=2521] It makes all the difference in the world.
[time=2523] Because in my experience, both with my wife and as I try to help other married people, I find that one of the greatest benefits to real conflict resolution is when each spouse privately and individually will assess that situation with a careful view to what each person might have done.
[time=2545] And then come to the place where they can say this, make a clear statement, what I did hurt you and then list that stuff off.
[time=2556] What I did, blink, blink, blink, it hurt you.
[time=2560] I'm very sorry, will you forgive me?
[time=2564] Oh man, you wanna talk about a huge step in the right direction, there it is.
[time=2570] But so often the opposite is true.
[time=2573] We come to the door, guns loaded, ready to say, "Hey, this is your fault and this is why it's your fault." We got all these reasons and we're very defensive and the other person's defensive and guess what happens?
[time=2586] The problem gets worse.
[time=2587] What's amazing in it?
[time=2590] That's great advice, that's great truth.
[time=2592] Take a look right here first.
[time=2595] Well, the third principle that God's word gives us on conflict resolution is this, plan a peace conference.
[time=2603] No, I mean actually do it.
[time=2606] Plan a specific time at a specific place where you can deal with the conflict in your marriage.
[time=2614] The Bible says don't let the sun go down on your anger.
[time=2617] That doesn't so much mean that you can't fall asleep until all the issues are worked out.
[time=2622] What it means is that you are unwise if you allow conflict to go unresolved for an extended period of time because the longer it goes in reality, the deeper it sinks and the deeper it hurts and the more pain it causes and the farther the separation.
[time=2639] And so the Bible says don't let that happen.
[time=2641] I have found that we don't work out the conflict in our life really well, kind of in the cracks of life, kind of in that spare little moment.
[time=2652] You know, in the kitchen about dinner time is probably not a good idea with five kids to say, "Hey, let's work this problem out." You know, there's thousands of questions, food is flying everywhere, problems are arising.
[time=2664] You know, that is not the place.
[time=2666] It's not the right time when the phone continually rings and interrupts the dialogue and the flow of thought and the movement of two people towards each other.
[time=2673] Without sufficient time, even if there's a nervousness that we only have 15 and we probably need about an hour, conflict is very difficult to resolve.
[time=2684] Don't let the sun go to plan a peace conference where you can be assured that you won't be interrupted, where you have sufficient time to honestly discuss and work through the issue.
[time=2698] When you come to this peace table, you might do three things.
[time=2703] You might do three things.
[time=2705] Number one, as I have already mentioned, you might ask for forgiveness.
[time=2708] You might have already assessed your condition and really come ready to put your cards on the table and admit to what you've done and apologize and seek the forgiveness of another person.
[time=2717] The second thing you might do is be solution oriented.
[time=2720] Listen, I'll tell you what, we are amazingly resourceful people when it's something we really wanna get done.
[time=2728] And when you come to the table to talk about your budgeting problems, your checkbook problems, your scheduling problems, your intimacy problems, your child problems, your work problems, whatever it is that's causing that conflict in your relationship.
[time=2743] I urge you to come with a mentality of we can solve this problem.
[time=2748] We can beat this thing.
[time=2750] We can compromise together.
[time=2751] We can find solutions.
[time=2753] And the third thing I wanna caution you as you come to that.
[time=2758] That peace talk is gonna take more courage than anything else in your life.
[time=2764] It takes more courage to sit at one of those peace talks and stay in there and keep negotiating than anything else in the world.
[time=2772] I'm talking the kind of courage it takes to fight in a war or something in life and death situations.
[time=2776] I get so disappointed sometimes when men will speak to me about the way they handle conflict and they will insinuate or clearly indicate that boy they really took that situation under hand and they straightened her out and they said such and such and she didn't buy it so he says so I just got up and I said some real poignant things and then I just walked out the door and I slammed it behind me and now she knows who's in charge.
[time=2803] And I'm like, I'm supposed to be impressed by what you're saying.
[time=2807] It's a terrible lack of courage.
[time=2813] It takes courage to stay there and listen and be listened to and continue to look for the solutions.
[time=2820] More courage than anything else, maybe in your life.
[time=2823] There's something so tempting about just sharing a bad piece of your mind with somebody and then storming out of the room as if that did anything.
[time=2832] Plan a peace conference, set some time aside
[time=2838] to get the job done.
[time=2841] Number four, number four and the Bible's very clear about this one.
[time=2845] If after, if after you've began to process the problem privately
[time=2851] and you've even had your peace conference and you even stayed at your peace conference but resolution just won't come.
[time=2858] For whatever reason it just seems elusive and neither of you seem to be able to come to grips with a solution.
[time=2866] I want to invite you to invite a consultant, a consultant into your marriage.
[time=2872] And I know some of you are sitting there thinking that's the last thing in the world I'm ever going to do.
[time=2877] Over my dead body, if you think for one minute I'm going to let somebody else into my problems, my marital problems, no way, I'll handle my own issues.
[time=2886] And you've been saying that for a number of years now and if you were honest you'd look back and you'd have to admit that the issues haven't gotten better.
[time=2894] The relationship has just continued to repel itself and it's harder and harder and harder to find those real spots of joy in your marriage relationship.
[time=2904] What amazes me is that many people who say no way, no marriage consultant in my life, happily invite consultants into the workplace to solve management problems.
[time=2918] You have no concern there.
[time=2919] You invite and pay good money.
[time=2921] You've got a financial problem so you hire a financial consultant named an accountant.
[time=2927] You have a health problem with your body and so you hire a medical consultant called a doctor.
[time=2932] I don't get why it's such a huge leap to invite a well-trained consultant into your marriage to help you solve those problems as well.
[time=2943] The Bible says there is wisdom, there is wisdom in a multitude of counselors.
[time=2951] I hate to think, I hate to think where my relationship would be with Heidi today, were we not the benefit of this kind of counseling?
[time=2961] Sometimes it's just our friends.
[time=2965] We make a regular and steady attempt and we are successful in these attempts to get some alone time with dear friends and we ask the question, tell us about our marriage.
[time=2976] Tell us about Russ and Heidi.
[time=2978] What do you see going on here?
[time=2980] Tell us about Russ and Heidi and the kids.
[time=2982] And there have been times in our past where we have benefited immeasurably from the paid professional marriage counselor, not just by what they say in general, but by their very close and intimate look at our life and the way we relate.
[time=2997] Well, I wouldn't be good where we would be without this kind of help.
[time=3003] I think the Bible is really true, wisdom.
[time=3005] There is wisdom in a multitude of counselors.
[time=3007] I like to think of it in terms of when you're driving
[time=3013] in a car and you're gonna change lanes, there, you wanna move to the right-hand lane, two lanes going in the same direction, you wanna move to the right-hand lane and what do you do?
[time=3021] You hit the blinker, you indicate that you're gonna move and then you check this mirror and then you check that mirror and if you're careful, you throw a look over your shoulder.
[time=3029] But you and I know that with all that kind of caution, it's still possible to lose a car in your blind spot, isn't it?
[time=3035] There may have been a time or two since you've been driving when you did all those processes and started to move only to hear the blare of a horn to say, hey, they'll run me over.
[time=3044] I'm here, you know, it's just that way in our relationships with our spouses.
[time=3050] We can go through the process of looking internally, we can go through the process of listening to that other partner, but we're both kind of in the same car.
[time=3058] What I find so intriguing about that is that the car three back, not the one you're gonna run into, but the one just behind that, you know, that car sees everything before it happens.
[time=3070] I mean, it can see as plain as day that you can't move over like that.
[time=3075] There's no blind, it's a matter of perspective, just as our drama pointed out.
[time=3079] Man, what a great thing to think that you would open your life up enough to let a marriage counselor take a look or some dear close friends who you trust.
[time=3090] Say, would you tell us where our blind spots are?
[time=3092] I don't get it.
[time=3093] Every time I do this, she does this and I don't get why it's so offensive.
[time=3096] Or could you help me with this?
[time=3099] I mean, she just, I don't know why she keeps doing this.
[time=3103] Could you just give us a perspective on this, please?
[time=3105] Boy, there's no reason, there is no possible reason for you as a couple to languish in isolation.
[time=3112] There are some great people in this city who can really offer help.
[time=3116] There are churches that can offer help.
[time=3118] There are other friends that you have that could offer help.
[time=3121] Don't try to do it by yourself.
[time=3123] Well, we'll wrap this up here today.
[time=3128] I just want you to take a moment and say, "Hey, where am I on this?
[time=3131] "Where are we on this?
[time=3135] "Maybe on your way home today." You might say, "Are we Eskimo?
[time=3138] "Are we letting a thing deep freeze?
[time=3142] "Are we doing the cowboy thing "and everybody's got their vests on "and that's why our home has become such a lonely place?
[time=3147] "Are we all lost in the escapism of the moment "and I'm running over here and you're running over there?
[time=3155] "And as long as those two things "you can say semi-satisfying, "we kind of just continue to exist together?
[time=3161] "Are we man-handling the home here?
[time=3165] "You want to consider another option?
[time=3169] "Well, I just want you to think about it "because it's true and it's real.
[time=3173] "It's surprising that it could come from such an old book, "but it really makes a difference.
[time=3177] "In a moment, we're going to stand for closing word of prayer, "but let me remind you this whole thing begins "by starting the resolving of the conflict "in your relationship, by resolving your relationship with God.
[time=3191] "I just want to say to you, if you're here today "and you feel that ache in your soul, "that restlessness, that haunting feeling, "that things are not right with you and God, "you can change that by accepting Christ as your Savior, "committing your life to Christ today.
[time=3211] "If you need help with that after the service "and I invite you to come down, just privately, "I'll be here, I'd love to talk with you about that, "or maybe talk with the person that brought you.
[time=3218] "Allow God to create a spirit of reconciliation, "a real attitude that wants to be put back together "and is willing to pay the price to do it.
[time=3229] "And then process the problem privately, "then plan a peace conference, "if need be seek marriage counseling." And you know what you'll find?
[time=3238] If you move in this direction, you're gonna find there's this wonderful secondary benefit.
[time=3242] When you get that marriage thing worked out, you'll find it has implications on the way you treat your kids.
[time=3249] You're gonna be able to resolve conflict with your children a whole lot better.
[time=3254] People at work, extended family members.
[time=3257] It's gonna invade all the rest of your life, all the other relationships.
[time=3261] It's not conflict free.
[time=3263] Listen to me, I'm not saying there's no conflict.
[time=3265] I'm saying there's a way to resolve it that is healthy.
[time=3269] And it promotes intimacy.
[time=3271] And what a worthy thing to try.
[time=3275] I mean, what's the alternative?
[time=3278] Conflict is a constant.
[time=3280] If you don't resolve it in healthy ways, marriage is turned into statistics.
[time=3286] Don't let that happen.
[time=3287] Let's stand together for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3300] (gentle music) It's quite an interesting subject, conflict resolution.
[time=3316] And I'm amazed as I continue to grow and experience more and more of life, just how central relationships are to life.
[time=3324] I mean, it's not where you work or even what you do when you're at work.
[time=3328] It's the people that you're with that makes work good or bad.
[time=3333] It's not the kind of recreation you enjoy, whether it's golf or tennis or bowling or whatever it may be.
[time=3339] I find that it's who I'm doing that recreation with.
[time=3342] If I enjoy them and if I enjoy my relationship with them, then I have a great time.
[time=3348] And on the other hand, if I don't enjoy the people I'm doing that with, then no matter what sport I might be playing or what activity I might be involved in, it loses its color, it loses its luster.
[time=3359] And I'm not really interested in doing it.
[time=3361] It's not so much where a person lives, how big a home or on what street, it's what goes on inside that home that makes it significant.
[time=3371] It's the relationships inside that home that make it a joyful place or a very, very unhappy place.
[time=3377] And I just don't want you to miss a clear understanding that that really is the basic element of life, the relationships with people, and as we've noted this morning, your relationship with God.
[time=3390] The Bible is a book all about relationships.
[time=3394] It has a lot of Old Testament stories, New Testament stories and historic events, but those are merely the backdrop against which the drama of true human relationships are worked out.
[time=3405] And you can find good relationships there and you can find bad relationships there.
[time=3409] And they kind of stand out as beacons or guiding lights for us to learn from that again, the real substance of life consists of the way we treat people, the way we are in relationship with people and the way that people treat us.
[time=3424] And I think as you look in your own life, there's more than enough evidence to support that.
[time=3428] You can just kind of oversee the landscape of the last year or two or three or five years of your life and I'll bet you're happy or sad, dependent not so much on how much you've made financially or where you live or what your recreation is.
[time=3443] It's how you're treating people and how those people are treating you.
[time=3447] The Lord wants to solve that problem in your life and God can fix all of that through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3454] If you'd like to pray to receive Him at this time, just follow me as I pray this prayer.
[time=3459] Heavenly Father, I know that I'm a sinner.
[time=3462] I know that I've violated my relationship with you and with people and I ask you to forgive me through the shed blood of Jesus Christ.
[time=3469] Come inside of me and give me a spirit of reconciliation for your glory and for your honor.
[time=3474] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3476] Well, if you've just made that decision, I invite you to write us here at the Bible Hour and let us know about it.
