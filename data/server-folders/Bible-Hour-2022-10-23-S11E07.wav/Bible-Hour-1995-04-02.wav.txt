[time=0] Why is it that the church, why is it that Christians, why is it that believers are so
[time=8] open to, susceptible to, and interested in false doctrine, moving beyond the simple,
[time=16] pure devotion to the person of Jesus Christ?
[time=26] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=30] You're glad you've joined us.
[time=31] Have you ever wondered why the church is so susceptible to false doctrine?
[time=36] Even a cursory skimming of the New Testament reveals the early church was plagued with it.
[time=41] And there's a little difference today.
[time=43] What is it about Christians that makes them so intrigued, so open to and gullible to false
[time=49] doctrine?
[time=50] Stay with us today as Pastor Moore explains how dangerous it can be when the Christian goes looking for more.
[time=57] Okay now, let's join our service.
[time=87] [MUSIC - 234 seconds]
[time=338] [APPLAUSE]
[time=355] [MUSIC - 164 seconds]
[time=541] [APPLAUSE]
[time=548] God and everybody else, what a wonderful morning of music and worship on the person of Christ.
[time=553] It's so fitting because that is exactly the topic of our message this morning.
[time=557] If you take your Bible and come and meet a Colossians chapter 2, we get to go back to this wonderful book that exalts the person of Christ that says Christ is sufficient.
[time=567] It is all we need and that has certainly been the theme of our music this morning.
[time=572] Well let me pose a question for you just to kind of get your mind and gear as we think about some of the truths in this particular passage.
[time=578] Have you ever wondered why the church is so open to false doctrine?
[time=585] Have you ever thought about why the church itself is so open to false doctrine, false teachings, false truth?
[time=594] I mean just a cursory reading of the New Testament reveals that the New Testament or early church was literally plagued by false prophets who were having a heyday inside the churches of the early church period.
[time=607] And if you review history at all you'll see the same thing and if you look around you'll see the same thing even in our day.
[time=613] Why is it that the church, why is it that believers, why is it that Christians are so open to, susceptible to and interested in false doctrine?
[time=623] I mean I get it from Satan's perspective, I understand it from his angle, 2 Corinthians 11.
[time=629] He disguises himself as an angel of light, he is the father of lies, he loves and delights in falsehoods that are mixed with enough truth to become palatable.
[time=638] If he can infect the church with false doctrine he can lead people astray, weaken the testimony with time, destroy that church.
[time=645] It makes perfect sense from his angle.
[time=647] I understand false teachers, 2 Peter 2 tells us that they are self-willed men, eyes are full of adultery, their hearts are trained in greed.
[time=655] They are arrogant and they are slaves of corruption, they are very tools of Satan to propagate his false doctrines.
[time=662] They are out of their mind with self-willed lustful hearts, trained in greed, proud, arrogant slaves in fact of this corruption.
[time=671] I get it from their perspective.
[time=673] What I don't get is what makes heresy and false doctrines so appealing to the church, to believers, to people who have confessed Christ.
[time=682] Why when they hear that stuff don't they just immediately repudiate it as falsehood and walk away?
[time=687] Why is there ever an audience for a false prophet inside the church of God?
[time=693] I believe that at least part of the answer to that question is bound up in the little phrase looking for more,
[time=700] which happens to be the title of our message this morning.
[time=703] Believers are prone to be looking for more.
[time=707] There is a certain progression that I have noticed inside of Christendom.
[time=711] A person comes to Christ and at point of exhilaration it's an unbelievable high.
[time=717] There is forgiveness for the first time, there is a fresh start, there is now a hope in life eternal, there is the Word of God,
[time=724] there is the Holy Spirit, there is prayer, there is Christian fellowship and the believer, the new believer is almost beside himself
[time=731] with joy and excitement and expectation for all this new stuff that he may or she may have just stumbled into.
[time=738] They are overwhelmed by it and the expectations are incredibly high.
[time=742] But I have noticed a progression going from exhilaration and high expectation to reality.
[time=748] And sooner or later every believer finds out that Christianity is less than we want it to be.
[time=755] Less than we want it to be, not in terms of total forgiveness, not in terms of ultimate sanctification
[time=761] and glorification in the wonders of heaven, but in the here and now Christianity is really less than we want it to be.
[time=767] Which leaves us open to the invitation that there is more somewhere.
[time=775] If we could just understand it, if we could just learn about it, if we could just pursue it, and we would be satisfied.
[time=781] In other words, the progression goes from the wonderful reality of being forgiven to the harsh reality that experiencing that forgiveness
[time=789] and trusting in that forgiveness and extending that forgiveness to other people is hard.
[time=795] Having a fresh start is wonderful, but somehow my past somehow our past have a nasty way of hanging around
[time=802] and raising their ugly heads in our presence.
[time=805] And while we're freed from the power of sin in our past and the problems at least before God of our past,
[time=812] we still have bad habits, we still have bad memories, and it shows up.
[time=817] Having the Word of God is awesome, the true and living Word of God.
[time=822] But we soon find out that its counsel is hard to follow, and it's hard to apply, and it's hard to implement in our lives.
[time=832] Having the Holy Spirit is an unspeakable privilege, but the comfort he often provides is less than we might desire or think we would need.
[time=843] Prayer is unbelievable, we can walk into the very throne room of God through the person of Christ, and we are invited to share all of our concerns
[time=852] as trivial as they may be to an omnipotent God.
[time=855] But we soon find out that prayer gets confusing and messy and sometimes repetitious, and we don't understand how it collides with the sovereignty of God.
[time=864] And Christian friends, oh my the wonder, the centrality of Christian fellowship inside the church and how refreshing that can be and how much a person can have a sense of being overfilled with joy
[time=876] because now there are people who love the same Lord and who love them and their fellowship.
[time=881] Those same Christian friends can be a source of our greatest hurt, our greatest wounding, and they themselves can be remarkably demanding on us.
[time=892] We come to the realization, we come to the reality that Christianity can be less in the here and now than we thought it would be and certainly would want it to be,
[time=900] which is to say nothing of just outright suffering for the cause of Christ and being persecuted and living a self-sacrificing life.
[time=911] Add those are the mix, and the Christian begins to say there has got to be more.
[time=919] Enter the false teacher, enter the false prophet with his false doctrines who says and there is, and there is.
[time=928] You just need to move past the person of Christ and add to him this or this or this or this and you'll have more.
[time=936] And you'll find the satisfaction you're looking for.
[time=939] You won't have to wait and hope which are major themes of Christianity.
[time=943] You won't have to suffer and be persecuted. You won't have to go through trials, all of which are the very fabric of Christian experience, short of heaven.
[time=954] Let me show it to you in another group of Christians. They are the Hebrews. If you turn quickly there, keep your place in Colossians. We'll be back.
[time=961] But come to Hebrews chapter 10, you find this obvious progression.
[time=969] These were people who left their religion for Christ and you will see from these verses dedicated, committed, vibrant, faithful, powerful Christian witness.
[time=982] Hebrews chapter 10, verse 32, but remember the former days when after being enlightened you endured a great conflict of sufferings.
[time=991] That enlightenment means coming to the knowledge of Christ.
[time=994] Verse 33, partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated.
[time=1002] For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property knowing that you have for yourselves a better possession and an abiding one.
[time=1010] There it is. There's Christianity. There's a sense of camaraderie and fellowship where one believer suffers for the benefit of the other.
[time=1017] Tribulations and reproaches becoming prisoners, becoming friends of prisoners and accepting joyfully the seizure of your property.
[time=1024] Folks, this is a level of suffering and commitment and dedication to the cause of Christ that few of us, if any, have ever experienced.
[time=1031] I mean, they were big in the joy and big in the exhilaration of Christianity, but the whole book is about the possibility of their now turning away from the very Christ they have served so faithfully in the search of something more.
[time=1046] Somehow, some way the lustre lost. Somehow, some way it wasn't enough anymore.
[time=1052] Somehow, some way this Christ thing just wasn't cutting it.
[time=1055] So if you'd come to Hebrews 2, you'll see the first of five warning passages because they're in jeopardy of moving away from Christ and looking for more somewhere else.
[time=1065] Hebrews 2, verse 1, for this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard.
[time=1072] In other words, don't get anything new. Go backwards.
[time=1075] Look back on the fundamental doctrines that establish you in Christ lest we drift away from it.
[time=1082] You see that in verse 1? Chapter 2? Don't drift away from it.
[time=1087] In verse 3, how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?
[time=1093] Where are you going, Hebrews? Where are you going? Go back, not forward.
[time=1100] Go back into the fundamental truths of Christianity, not into some new false doctrine or alternative source of self-satisfaction.
[time=1110] You can see the second of the five. In verse 12, he says, "Take care, brethren.
[time=1116] Be careful lest there should be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart in falling away from the living God."
[time=1127] You see, they were in danger, weren't they?
[time=1130] But encourage one another day after day as long as it is still called today lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
[time=1139] There are a great number of these Hebrew Christians which having experienced the wonder we wrote about in chapter 10 of all that Christ meant and suffering and all this stuff.
[time=1150] But now you see, somehow it had become somewhat lackluster and boring and they were looking for more and so apparently the deceitfulness of sin,
[time=1159] they were even entertaining going back into a sinful lifestyle.
[time=1164] In fact, these would have progressed from the legalism of Judaism to the liberty of Christ and now we're on the edge of jumping into just straight out unbelief and the wickedness and the morality and the greed and all the junk of the world.
[time=1179] It's a very common progression. It's a very common progression and it is what makes the Christian, in my opinion, so susceptible to false doctrine.
[time=1188] Back to Colossians 2, at least one of the things. And that is exactly what is happening here in the book of Colossians.
[time=1194] Exactly what is happening.
[time=1197] They started strong in Christ. You would remember chapter 1, the gospel couldn't have been explained anymore clearly.
[time=1204] I mean, Paul just goes on and on about the faith in Christ and love which you have for all the saints and the hope which is laid up for you in heaven.
[time=1211] And you heard the word of truth, the gospel, he says in chapter 1. I mean, he said, that's where you began.
[time=1218] But now as we come into chapter 2, there are four heresies that are confronting the church.
[time=1224] And these at Colossae, differently than those of the Hebrews, in the book of Hebrews, the Hebrews were ready to jump out of religion altogether and just into the deceitfulness of sin and just run off in the lustful lifestyle of their culture and their day.
[time=1239] But these Colossians are looking for something more, but they're not going to go to the world. They're going to go to false doctrine.
[time=1245] They're going to go to something they can add to Christianity, some component they can just bring into, and that'll really make it all happen for them.
[time=1253] And there are four of them in this chapter. One is human philosophy. We've looked at that verses 1 to 10.
[time=1259] Then was legalism 11 to 17. We've looked at that and this morning, we will look at verses 18 to 23. 18 to 23.
[time=1270] It's a little bit like Christmas at the Morehouse. Every year, my parents would be careful to try to give a present that was to everybody.
[time=1278] And I didn't understand it at the time, but I look back on it now. It was ingenious.
[time=1282] The desire was to unify us for at least the rest of that day instead of others of us running off and playing golf and others of us doing this.
[time=1290] Something they could give to all of us that we might have time together around it, and it sometimes was expensive and sometimes very inexpensive.
[time=1297] One time it was little planes, little balsa wood planes, and we're intensely competitive in my family, so we got out in the backyard and started having distance throws and acrobatic throws.
[time=1306] We just played with it for hours and it worked. One time they gave us hot wheels. We were like 14 to 25 years age. They didn't care. They got us hot wheels.
[time=1316] So we got the package open and there was this great box with all the advertisement and you'd think by looking at the box that you were going to get jennisoned into space on these deals.
[time=1325] They could do everything. So we set it up and it was really fun and we ran it and that was what I like to refer to as the excitement phase about these gifts.
[time=1332] It was just exciting, brand new, new technology. But soon we found out that somebody's car was faster than somebody else's car, so we entered into the modification stage.
[time=1341] And we started taking the bodies apart and just having chassis run and filing this and adding weights here and all this stuff, and then we just had to modify the whole thing.
[time=1350] And then we fast got into the third and final stage called the destruction phase because our modifications would inevitably lead us to break the car.
[time=1359] And it'd be over, but that was okay because it took four hours and that was the whole purpose anyway.
[time=1364] That happens inside of Christianity. You come to Christ. You're in the excitement stage. Oh my! Look at this! Look at us advertising.
[time=1372] And there are expectations that are not biblical for Christianity in the here and now, but we read them in and we think, oh, we're going to be jettisoned into some unbelievable kind of experience.
[time=1383] Then reality, Don's in your car doesn't run as fast as you want it to. Your Christian life doesn't look like you, so you start modifying and tinkering with it.
[time=1390] And pretty soon, if you enter into false doctrine, you will eventually destroy it. And it will be of no effect.
[time=1397] You will have walked away from the person of Christ, one little false doctrine at a time in the quest for more.
[time=1406] That's what these folks are in danger of. They want to add some stuff to the car.
[time=1412] But they don't understand that in adding and remodeling and in modifying, they eventually destroy the car.
[time=1420] What is mysticism? What is mysticism? Verses 18 and 19, let's read the verses.
[time=1426] Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in self-abasement and the worship of angels taking his stand on visions he has seen inflated without cause by his own fleshly mind.
[time=1437] And not holding fast to the head, from whom the entire body being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments, grows with the growth which is from God.
[time=1450] Mysticism, though not defined here, can be simply defined as a deeper or higher religious experience based on some personal intuition.
[time=1461] Mysticism is a deeper or a higher religious experience based upon simply my personal intuition.
[time=1470] It would go something like this, quote, "I have had an experience with God.
[time=1476] I can't totally define it for you, but I have touched God, and God has touched me."
[time=1483] That, in essence, is mysticism. And the invitation of the mystic, to the non-mystic, to those of us who were the boring Bible believers of our day, or of that day, was this, come away with me into mysticism.
[time=1498] Leave behind you the boring mundane realities of Christianity, the suffering and the trials and the hardships.
[time=1505] There is a higher experience. There is a deeper experience. There is a more meaningful experience. There is a more satisfying experience awaiting you in the wonders of mysticism.
[time=1518] And they would base this belief and this invitation upon their visions and upon angelic activity. Look at it.
[time=1526] Verse 18, "Let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting you in self abasement and the worship of angels taking his stand on visions he has seen."
[time=1537] They would come and they would say something to the effect, "I have seen things beyond what you have seen.
[time=1543] I now comprehend and understand things that you don't understand. I am in the know and you are not in the know."
[time=1553] It's important to note that these dear folks, rather not dear folks, these false prophets and the dear folks who became their devotees and were misled by them may not have been making all this up.
[time=1564] It doesn't have to be that the false teachers got together and said, "Man, what are we going to do? We got to attack the church. How can we do that?"
[time=1571] Well, let's attack the church by offering them something more. Okay. But what avenue? Well, through the avenue of angels and visions.
[time=1576] Okay. Now, which one of you wants to have the contact? Okay. I'll take the contact with the angels. You take the visions. You want a vision or an angel.
[time=1581] All right. And they all get that figured out. Now, make your story up. Make it good. Let's go. We're off.
[time=1586] Didn't have to be there way at all. Satan, as we have noted, disguises himself as the angel of light.
[time=1593] And it may very well be that these false prophets and their devotees had had experiences with angels they thought were from God.
[time=1601] And may have had actual visions they thought were from God because Satan may have been able to create said experiences.
[time=1609] And they may have been as dedicated and devoted to these particular visions and angelic experiences as any of us would be to the fact that we went to the Scots market.
[time=1619] They did it. They had it. They experienced it. It was a part of their reality.
[time=1624] We know in Matthew 4 when the Lord is being tempted that the devil took him to a very high mountain and, quote, showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
[time=1633] Now, folks, that's impossible apart from some miraculous act.
[time=1638] You read your Old Testament and find particularly in the book of Exodus that Satan is very capable of performing certain kinds of miracles.
[time=1646] And so these people may have been acting in the insincerity of their heart wrong as they may have been speaking about actual experiences with a high level of intensity and a very convincing spirit.
[time=1657] One historian says this about angels. It is known that Michael, a leader of the host of angels, was worshiped widely in Asia Minor.
[time=1666] And this worship too continued for centuries. So, for example, as late as AD 739, AD 739, the scene of a great victory over the Sarah scenes was dedicated to him, Michael.
[time=1681] His worship is also implied in inscriptions found in Galatia. He was given credit for miraculous cures.
[time=1688] He, in fact, may have been at least one masquerading as Michael may have been the one to produce the cures.
[time=1696] He may have been the one to produce the victory. It may have been very real stuff.
[time=1703] Now, an interesting dynamic would begin to occur. And it always happens this way between the haves and the haves not.
[time=1708] Inside the church, there would be those who had bought into these visions and these angelic experiences as the path to true spirituality, to getting more, to finding satisfaction.
[time=1719] And then there would be those who didn't buy into it. And there would become a fraction. There would become unrest and disunity.
[time=1727] And that is conveyed to us by two words in verse 18. The first, defrauding. See, if there let no one keep defrauding you of your prize by delighting in, blah, blah, blah.
[time=1738] The word defraud in the ancient language was an athletic term. And it was used by the umpire whose job it was to disqualify people from a contest because they did not obey the rules.
[time=1752] So these in the know, these false teachers and their devotees would come around and begin to say you are disqualified from the race for God, from true spiritual meaning in life because you are not playing by the rules, which rules, the rules of the mystic, the interpretations of the angels and the visions we have seen.
[time=1772] You're not even in the race anymore. You're out of it. And they would do that with an attitude of pride and arrogance. Again, verse 18, the middle of the verse, they would take their stands on what they had seen inflated without cause by his fleshly mind, inflated without cause.
[time=1792] Arrogant. We're on the inside. We are on the know. We call it spirituality. The Bible calls it, however, pride and arrogance all puffed up in their fleshly mind.
[time=1806] You see? That can't be of God. That can't be of God. Things of God. Things which are truly to grow the saints don't bring some saints to disqualify other saints and cause some saints to be proud and puffed up in their fleshly mind.
[time=1821] against other saints. That kind of disunity is in fact the very product that Satan was seeking for when he started down this avenue with them.
[time=1833] Divide the church. Divide the believer. Tear them apart. What does 1 Corinthians 8 1 say? Knowledge puffs up. But love builds up.
[time=1844] The hallmark of Christianity is love. And love builds people up. It doesn't tear people down.
[time=1849] So what he is saying in effect is you obviously have the wrong source. The true source is none other than Christ himself. Look at verse 19. This is great.
[time=1860] And not holding fast to the head from whom the entire body being supplied and held together by the joints and ligaments grows with the growth which is from God.
[time=1869] You want to grow with the growth that is from God that you better stay connected to your head. Who's the head? Christ and only Christ. And what will Christ do? Christ will supply.
[time=1882] Christ is the source of true supply. Christ is the one who holds together. Christ is the one who grows people in the Lord or in their salvation or in their spirituality.
[time=1894] It's so fascinating. It says they are held together by the joints and the ligaments. Now think about this. Church is often referred to as a body and a body has different parts. Some of us arise, some of us are ears, some of us are feet, some of us are arms.
[time=1906] And underneath all that stuff, for example in your finger there's a couple of different bones in there. And one bone is held to the next bone by what? The joints and the ligaments. That's the stuff that makes one body part work with another body part which makes all the body parts work with all the body parts which makes all the body parts follow the head.
[time=1923] So all you ask yourself what in the out of the metaphor now into the church I get I'm a part. I mean I'm a bone or I'm a hand that's held to the arm. I'm not the arm. I'm the hand. Jim's the arm. What holds rust to Jim?
[time=1938] Our relationship. It's our relationship. That's the point of connection. The joints and the ligaments of Christianity of the body of Christ are the relationships of Christianity.
[time=1950] You know, the strong, vibrant, healthy, productive, growing relationships, not defrauding relationships, not inflated relationships, not relationships of intimidation which tear the church down.
[time=1965] He says you want to grow? You want to know what it means to grow? You stay connected to Christ. You stay strong in vital relationship with one another and you'll find a growth that comes from God and God alone.
[time=1977] Let me put it to you this way. In contrast to the false mystical worship of angels and visions which produces a spiritual pride and elitism, thereby fracturing the body.
[time=1989] True worship always humbles a person. The mind is awed by the greatness of God. The heart is filled with a love for God. The will is submitted to the purposes of God.
[time=1999] True spiritual experience with God through the person of Christ leads to submission, sacrifice and unity always. That's important.
[time=2010] True spiritual experience with God through the person of Christ leads to submission, sacrifice and unity. Job experienced it when he saw God, he wasn't defrauding other people and he wasn't inflated and full of pride.
[time=2023] He said I repent in dust and ashes and I'll do whatever God wants me to do. When Isaiah saw God, he said essentially the same thing. I repent. I curse myself.
[time=2034] And how can I serve you God? And that service of course was intended to build up the nation of Israel. Peter saw God and repented and wanted to worship.
[time=2043] John saw God in Revelation 117 and "fell at his feet like a dead man." The kind of product that mysticism was producing was its own apologetic against itself.
[time=2059] And so far from Christianity that's so far from what Christianity is about. Christ is enough. Don't go looking anywhere else. You want to grow with a growth from God? Stay right on dead center with the person of Christ.
[time=2073] True spiritual nourishment comes from Jesus Christ. Don't go looking for more anywhere else.
[time=2081] If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the world, why? As if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself to decrees such as do not handle, do not taste, do not touch?
[time=2101] Which all refer to things destined to perish with the using in accordance with the commandments and the teachings of men.
[time=2109] These are matters which have to be sure the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion and self abasement and severe treatment of the body but are of no value against fleshly indulgence.
[time=2120] Now you see that little phrase there, do not handle, do not taste, do not touch. You think, "Oh, we're back to legalism." No, we're not back to legalism. It's a totally different thing altogether.
[time=2128] Legalism was a very, in one sense, reasonable system. It was unreasonable that you could never perform satisfactorily to God and therefore it was referred to as a heavy burden.
[time=2138] But as far as how you treated your body in that system, it was a very reasonable system. There were things you could do and you couldn't do but it didn't really hurt you, it wasn't bad for you.
[time=2146] A seticism is bad for you. A seticism means harshness or severity or brutality. One who practiced asceticism, practiced rigorous self-denial and even self-mortification in order to become more spiritual.
[time=2163] And what he is saying in verse 21 by Don't Handle, Don't Taste and Don't Touch, he is really, that is a very sarcastic statement whereby he tries to reduce verse, the end of verse 21, all their commandments and their teaching which they would have lifted up and revered
[time=2176] and worshiped at the altar of these great commandments and teachings as to how to hurt yourself to become more spiritual. And Paul very sarcastically in verse 21 just reduces him down to a couple of little pithy phrases. Don't handle, don't touch, don't taste. It was an insult to them.
[time=2190] They held that stuff in high regard. Now we don't know much about what they did, I mean from the Word of God, but history tells us there was a remarkable level of dedication to this asceticism.
[time=2205] Some would never change their inner vest or wash their feet. Others would never take a bath. Others would become so filthy and so dirty that vermin would fall off their body when they would walk.
[time=2219] Others would castrate themselves. Others would wear coarse inner garments with thorns and bristly stuff that would point inward so when they moved at all they inflicted pain upon themselves.
[time=2232] Others would sleep on hard boards. Others would literally whip themselves. Others would go days, sometimes years without speaking or uttering a word to another living human being.
[time=2245] Try that. Try that. Some of you are thinking, "Yeah honey, try that." Some would go long periods without food or sleep, long periods of time without food or sleep.
[time=2259] And it is summed up in verse 23 with this phrase, severe treatment of the body. They were trying to sanctify the soul by disciplining the body. They were trying to sanctify the inner man by doing damage to the outer man.
[time=2276] And you say, "That's ridiculous." Read the testimony of some of today's anorexics and you will find that they will get themselves into a system where when starving themselves they experience a certain kind of adrenaline and a rush and a power over themselves. That is, in itself it's intoxicating to them.
[time=2299] And it may have been the same dynamic for the ones practicing this asceticism. That may have been the adrenaline or the feeling or the high or the something that was to be attained that when you could hurt yourself bad enough there's a weird perverted sense of adrenaline that comes when you destroy yourself.
[time=2321] And the more you could do of it the better it fell because the worse it fell.
[time=2327] Well Paul says not only does human philosophy not promote real growth nor legalism nor mysticism neither does asceticism and he gives us three reasons why this is not the way it happens in these remaining verses. Look up one above, verse 20.
[time=2344] He says you have died with Christ to what? To the elementary principles of the world. Why? As if you were living in the world do you submit yourself to decrees?
[time=2357] Look you have been moved outside the domain of the elementary principles. Don't go back. What was he talking about?
[time=2367] Colossians 1.13 says that Christ has rescued us from the domain of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of his son.
[time=2376] There is a domain out there called the domain of darkness and it has its principles, its elementary principles.
[time=2382] There is this other domain over here. It's called the domain of God, the kingdom of God, the kingdom of his beloved son and a different set of rules and a different set of principles govern those who reside in this new domain.
[time=2395] And the question is don't go back. Why go back? You've been liberated.
[time=2401] Shun the thought. I mentioned to you many of the New Testament books described this process of the church going after something other than Christ.
[time=2411] Galatians would be another book and they kind of hit on it here. It will give us insight into this idea of why go back.
[time=2418] Galatians 4.9 says, but now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how is it that you turn back again to the weak and worthless elemental things to which you desire to be enslaved all over again?
[time=2433] Those you get it, you've been transferred out of one into the other and now you're looking back and you want to go back and all that back is is enslavement of the weak and worthless elemental principles of the world.
[time=2442] Things like asceticism, things like legalism, things like mysticism. You're free. Stay free.
[time=2450] And Galatians it goes on to say in chapter 6, 14, "But may it never be that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world."
[time=2466] That whole domain of the world and its elemental principles have been crucified to me and I to it.
[time=2472] So when I boast and when I find things to be happy about it is in nothing other than the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2479] The very cross that liberated me, I've been delivered and I won't be going back.
[time=2485] In other words, now that you're in this new domain, you have a new perspective, you have new values, and you have new principles.
[time=2493] Live by those. You say what are those? What are these new principles?
[time=2499] Well, as they would relate to asceticism, 1 Timothy 4 says this, talking about false prophets, "There are men who forbid marriage and advocate abstaining from foods."
[time=2513] See, there's a form of asceticism and these guys come and say, "Hey, if you really want to know God, if you really want to grow in God, if you want to be fulfilled spiritually, a couple of things here gang, don't get married and don't eat certain foods."
[time=2528] Those are the elemental principles. Well, what are the new principles? Listen, he goes on.
[time=2535] Abstaining from marriage and foods which God has created to be gratefully shared in by those who believe and know the truth, for everything created by God is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with gratitude.
[time=2551] The way to perceive reality, the way the people in the new kingdom, looking back at the old kingdom, the way we perceive it is, "Wait a minute, there's nothing wrong with marriage, and there's nothing wrong with food, and there's nothing wrong with comfortable clothing, and there's nothing wrong with a soft mattress.
[time=2564] My land's God created all this stuff for our good to be enjoyed, and the principle from God is just do it with a grateful heart.
[time=2574] Why do you want to go back into asceticism?" He gave it to you. He created it. He called it good.
[time=2580] He said, "Enjoy it." He said, "Just one thing, just one little thing. Just be grateful to me for it as you enjoy it." That's a principle of the new kingdom. Stay in the new kingdom. Live there. Worship God for all he has given you.
[time=2592] Don't dishonor him by thinking you're becoming more spiritual, by refusing the good things he has given you.
[time=2599] First Timothy 4-8, we've been talking about asceticism and beating up your body and scarring yourself and hurting yourself and starving yourself.
[time=2607] What does it say? "Bodily discipline is only of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things since it holds promise for the present life and also for the one to come."
[time=2620] Yeah, you can work real hard on your body, and guess what you get when you're done? Little profit.
[time=2624] You want to know where the big profits are? You want to know where the real windfalls are? Get headed in the direction of spiritual godliness.
[time=2630] There is the thing that is profitable for two things. One, here and now, and then of course later.
[time=2636] Think about it here and now. You know what a person is? Who is godly in this day and age? You know what he is rich in?
[time=2644] Godly relationships, the thing of greatest value on human earth besides loving God. The asceticism drives people once again away from people.
[time=2653] I can't talk to you. I can't talk to anybody for a year. I'm going to get so close to God by starving myself that when I'm done, I won't be able to move a muscle.
[time=2662] I'm going to beat myself and whip myself in an effort to get so close to God that when I'm done I'll be so cut open. I won't be able to help you do a thing.
[time=2672] All the commandments of God are kept in loving God and loving people. Loving people means getting up and helping other people and serving them.
[time=2678] And if you're a faithful person committed to asceticism, you're so physically dilapulated, you can't help anybody.
[time=2685] You can't talk to them. You can't help them. You can't minister to them. You can't serve them.
[time=2689] Once again, it will destroy the community of the redeemed, which is Satan's first agenda for the church.
[time=2696] Keep us from functioning towards each other the way we're supposed to function because if we do, we build each other up, we get strong.
[time=2703] We win people to Christ. We unfold them into our group. We treat them that way. They win other people.
[time=2708] He can shut the whole system down. If he can just get us on the wrong track of growth, if he can just get us moving into the kinds of things that keep us from service.
[time=2721] Romans 14, 14, another principle from the new kingdom. I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself.
[time=2731] Everything's clean. Everything that's been declared clean is clean. Everything that isn't wrong is clean.
[time=2737] Enjoy it. Praise God for it. Worship it. Share it. Give it.
[time=2743] The new kingdom. I want to live in the new kingdom. I want to live under the rules of the new kingdom. I'm not going back, verse 20, to the elementary principles of the world.
[time=2755] The second reason. The second reason is found in verse 22. The second reason why asceticism is of no value.
[time=2763] Look at it right there, which all refer this command, do not handle, do not taste, do not touch. Those refer to things destined to perish with the using.
[time=2773] You're going to try to accomplish eternal objectives with temporal things.
[time=2778] You're going to try to affect something for all eternity when the very thing you use to affect it is itself temporal and will perish. It is only a matter of time.
[time=2789] It's insane. I mean, look, you do spiritual work in somebody's life. Do you know how you do it? You do it with eternal reality.
[time=2797] Number one, the Word of God. The Word of God is eternal. This looks temporal and this particular Bible is going to burn at some particular point in time.
[time=2804] But the words that it is, I mean the actual living true Word of God that is printed on this page is eternal and it is living and it will never perish.
[time=2812] And when you do eternal work, you best use an eternal instrument. And when a person comes to minister to another person, you say, well, there's two temporal things.
[time=2822] No, not true. The Christian is redeemed and has an eternal soul and will live forever in the presence of God.
[time=2828] And he tries to make contact with the other eternal soul and the unredeemed, whose soul at that point is destined for eternity in hell.
[time=2836] The real work goes on. That between the temporal and the temporal, it's the eternal soul talking to another eternal soul.
[time=2842] And then the eternal living Holy Spirit ministers in between that the eternal Word of God and eternal results come called eternal life.
[time=2849] And you say, what do you think you're doing? You're going to try to use temporal, perishable things to affect eternal reality.
[time=2856] You're in the wrong category. You can't do that. It's impossible. It won't work.
[time=2865] The third reason is found in verse 23. And boy, you can't say it any clearer than this. Look at this.
[time=2873] Now these are matters which have to be sure. The appearance of wisdom and self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body.
[time=2882] Boy, it looks good, isn't it? But are of no value against fleshly indulgence.
[time=2892] In other words, they lift themselves up as the paragon, as the apex of self-denial, of giving up wants and pleasures and rights.
[time=2902] And what the Bible tells us is that all those efforts are of no value against their own fleshly indulgences.
[time=2908] They are as selfish and as fleshly and as committed to themselves as anybody else in the world, even though they pretend not to be by all their self-abasement.
[time=2917] You can't get yourself unselfish by selfishly inflicting pain on yourself.
[time=2924] In other words, all their ritual and all their hardship and all their pain and all the prickly things and all the hard boards are nothing but masked selfishness and self-indulgence.
[time=2935] And they have not moved off square one in moving past fleshly indulgence because the way they are trying to do it does nothing in that effect.
[time=2942] You want to know how to get rid of fleshly indulgence? Get totally immersed into the person of Christ.
[time=2946] Lose yourself in Him. Live for Him. Let Him live in you and begin serving other people.
[time=2951] And then maybe you might make some progress towards this freedom from self-indulgence and fleshly indulgence.
[time=2958] Humility is a weird thing. Once you think you have it, you lost it.
[time=2963] You never perfect yourself in humility by trying to be humble.
[time=2969] You get humble by forgetting about yourself, being consumed in the sufficiency of Christ and His orders and marching decrees for your life.
[time=2977] And you wake up at the end of it and you find out that you were a little bit humble.
[time=2984] At which point you then confess your pride and then work again trying to lose yourself in Christ.
[time=2989] You don't grow by this stuff. There is nothing in this stuff. There is nothing in asceticism.
[time=2996] This very self-focused beating of yourself to be a better self that will liberate you from self.
[time=3004] It's a closed system. It's a cul-de-sac and it just goes around and around and around and around and around.
[time=3009] There's only one way out. His name is Christ.
[time=3012] And you either lose yourself in Him and you give yourself to Him or you stay locked in the cul-de-sac of fleshly indulgence.
[time=3022] Galatians 3-3, are you so foolish having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
[time=3032] You see, there's that progression again. You were on the right track. You came to Christ.
[time=3038] You said, "I can't work. I can't earn. I can't deserve." It's grace. You get perfected by grace.
[time=3046] And now you're going to perfect yourself by your flesh.
[time=3053] Why are you turning backwards? Why are you looking for more?
[time=3057] Stay solidly committed in pure devotion to the person of Christ.
[time=3064] Let me wrap this up with another question. A different question.
[time=3068] We began by asking, "Why is the church so susceptible?" What is it about believers that make us so susceptible to false doctrine looking for more?
[time=3079] The question we'll close with is this.
[time=3083] Are you in any danger?
[time=3086] Are you in any danger of being led away from pure devotion to Christ because you are looking for more?
[time=3092] And I don't mean into philosophy and legalism and mysticism and asceticism.
[time=3096] I mean, asceticism would go over like a lead balloon in American culture today, right?
[time=3100] I learned a lot of us signing up to think about that.
[time=3103] You don't have to be one of those four. It can be anything.
[time=3106] Are you running at a level of dissatisfaction with your Christianity that makes you susceptible to want to be open to something beyond the person of Christ?
[time=3117] That's an important question.
[time=3120] You see, what we said at the top of the morning or at the top of the message was absolutely right.
[time=3126] It is wonderful to be forgiven. It is hard to know forgiveness and give forgiveness.
[time=3132] You see, Christianity at its best is hard.
[time=3138] It is one thing to have a fresh start and it's a wonderful thing that God gives us.
[time=3142] Romans 6, he closes the old biography and he opens a new biography.
[time=3145] But somehow there's this cut and paste thing and they start bringing the old biography in and we got to live with it until we die, until we're glorified.
[time=3154] It's hard.
[time=3156] The Word of God is a marvelous thing, but it's hard to apply. It's hard to live.
[time=3161] The Holy Spirit is this awesome comforter.
[time=3163] He is everything God would intend him to be to us, but often God intends him to be less to us than we want him to be to us. And it's hard.
[time=3171] And prayer is confusing. And we can lose our fervor inside of prayer and our confidence in prayer
[time=3178] and it can become repetitious and it can become an external thing.
[time=3181] And Christian friends can be wonderful and they can't hurt and they can't desert and they can wound
[time=3187] and they can be demanding.
[time=3191] And suffering and persecution, things we in this culture know a little about.
[time=3198] Christianity at its best is hard.
[time=3201] That is true. That is a fact.
[time=3205] The Lord himself said in this world you will have trouble.
[time=3212] The issue is where are you going to go when it gets hard?
[time=3218] And are you looking outside of Christ for more?
[time=3227] Listen to the words of Paul as I close. It's a different book, but it's the same truth.
[time=3232] More than that he says, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[time=3242] For whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but rubbish in order that I may gain asceticism, legalism, mysticism, human philosophy, Christ.
[time=3256] Listen to the word value.
[time=3260] Value means what I really think is important.
[time=3264] It's not some distant removed word of like platitudes and all that stuff.
[time=3269] This is what he's saying. You want to know what turns my crank.
[time=3274] You want to know what gets me out of bed in the morning.
[time=3277] It is the value of knowing the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3283] He goes on that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his uninterrupted joy, his marvellously happy Christian life.
[time=3295] His splendid earthly experience, none of which by the way he had, that I may know the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being conformed to his death.
[time=3312] In order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead, where are you going to go Christian?
[time=3320] Where are you going to look?
[time=3323] You're going to be tempted because you're going to hurt.
[time=3326] Christianity isn't going to be all it's supposed to be.
[time=3328] That's a given.
[time=3330] How susceptible are you right now?
[time=3332] Put the labels on what it is that's dragging you away from the person of Christ.
[time=3336] Pure, simple devotion. Don't go anywhere else. Just go deeper into Christ.
[time=3341] And don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying go deep enough into Christ where you have no more trouble.
[time=3346] I'm saying keep going deep into Christ. You may find more trouble the deeper you go and keep going until you see his face.
[time=3352] And then your trouble will be over.
[time=3356] Because when you see his face, you'll be like him.
[time=3361] Then you'll be in glory.
[time=3364] Let's stand for a closing word prayer.
[time=3368] Well isn't it wonderful to know that everything we need pertaining to life and godliness can be found in one place?
[time=3387] And that's the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3389] If as you've been listening to the message today, you've found yourself wanting to get right with God through Christ to accept him as your personal Savior.
[time=3398] I invite you to follow along with a prayer I'm going to say in just a minute.
[time=3402] And if you say it quietly in your heart to God and mean it, he'll hear you.
[time=3406] He'll answer your prayer. He'll forgive you through Jesus Christ and you'll have eternal life.
[time=3411] So I'm going to pray that prayer now and I invite you to do the same.
[time=3415] My gracious God and Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3419] I know that I have violated your divine law.
[time=3422] That I deserve condemnation and judgment and punishment for my offenses.
[time=3427] But I believe in Jesus Christ and I ask you to send him into my life.
[time=3430] I accept him into my heart to be the forgiveness for my sins.
[time=3435] Thank you Father for forgiving me through Christ this day.
[time=3439] And I pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3442] Well, if you just prayed that prayer, we'd love to know about it here at the Bible of Arritus and tell us about that.
[time=3448] Also, I want you to understand that we're offering a little booklet about anger.
[time=3452] It's written by a man named Charles Swindall. He's a wonderful pastor.
[time=3456] He has a tremendous way with words and a clear grasp and an understanding of Scripture.
[time=3461] In this little booklet about anger, he'll define what anger is.
[time=3464] He'll talk about it from a biblical perspective. When is anger justified?
[time=3468] When is it unjustified? And how can we win over the battle of anger in our life?
[time=3474] You know, when it's not properly handled, it can be very destructive.
[time=3478] So I invite you to have this free of charge. Just write us here at the Bible hour and we'll send you a free copy of it.
[time=3485] In a moment, I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance or the booklet by Charles Swindall entitled "Anger."
[time=3494] You can also receive a cassette copy of today's message. Just ask for tape number 1702
