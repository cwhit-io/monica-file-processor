[time=0] What can I do to revitalize my relationship with God?
[time=8] How is it that I can get myself going again in my Christian life?
[time=12] And I would say that you then have come to this particular church on the right Sunday.
[time=18] Because the text in Colossians 3, 1 to 4 answers that question by saying you need to do two
[time=24] very simple and yet very hard things.
[time=34] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=38] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=40] Have you ever stopped to think about how little you have to say about so many really important aspects of your life?
[time=46] For example, you didn't get to choose your sex, your skin color, IQ, high or birthday.
[time=51] You didn't get to choose your parents, what country you'd be born in, or which century you'd live in.
[time=57] It's amazing how many of these issues are completely out of your control.
[time=62] But today in our study of God's word, we're reminded that the most important issues in life are under our control.
[time=69] We have both the right and the responsibility to make the really important decisions in life.
[time=75] Stay with us and see how you're doing.
[time=78] Now let's join our service.
[time=81] Sing the one gross love of Jesus, sing His mercy, and His grace, in all mentions,
[time=98] bright and blessed, we'll breathe here for us a place, when we all hear together.
[time=109] One day our justice has to be free, when we all see Jesus, we'll sing and shout the
[time=121] glory.
[time=138] We have both the right and the right and the right and the right and the right and the
[time=178] When us send me true and faithful, trustings serving every day, just one glimpse of Him
[time=197] in glory, we'll watch for the right and the right and the right and the right and the
[time=223] right and the right and the right and the right and the right and the right and the right
[time=597] Thank you Teresa. Let me invite you this morning to open your Bibles to Colossians. Chapter three, we're going to study the first four
[time=604] verses of this chapter and I was thinking as I was preparing that some of you are
[time=610] here this morning and you feel as though your Christianity has stalled. It's somehow
[time=617] run out of gas. You can remember when days were good in your relationship with the Lord and when you felt like you were growing and things were moving in the right direction but as you sit here today and as you would reflect upon the last week or several weeks or month of your life you recognize that your relationship with the Lord has definitely stalled and it's
[time=638] slowed down and you're in trouble. Let me give you some categories that you might connect with. You might be having trouble with some of your basic desires struggling with immorality,
[time=649] impurity, evil desires or greed. Others of you may be here this morning struggling with
[time=656] your relationships and you find they are characterized by anger and abusive speech. Others of you
[time=665] find yourself looking in the mirror and saying you know I don't like my character these days.
[time=671] I think it's heading in the wrong direction. I don't feel full of compassion and kindness and humility and generosity and patience. Others of you look at the home and you say
[time=682] man it's not well with my wife. It's not well with my husband. Things are not going in the
[time=690] right direction in my relationship with the kids. Others of you look at your place of
[time=696] employment and could say the same thing there. I'm making money or I'm doing my job that's
[time=702] not the issue but the relationship between my boss and myself or between my employees and me or between my fellow workers. It's just not happening. My attitude at work is out
[time=713] of sorts and it's not productive and it's not good and it's not going in the right direction.
[time=719] Some of you look at your life and say man we have lost any sense of witness, any sense of evangelism, any sense of proper contact with the outsider. When you come this morning
[time=731] wishing there could be something said that would help you change that. You're wishing that there could be something that could be done. What can I do to get back on track?
[time=741] What can I do to get myself going again in the right direction in my Christian life?
[time=746] And the text this morning answers that question. This particular text is kind of two. It will
[time=753] bring out two of the most fundamental things that the Christian must do to keep his relationship
[time=760] with Christ on track and therefore all the other things we've kind of highlighted. And
[time=766] you can see them. Chapter three verse one. If then you have been raised up with Christ, here's the first one. Keep seeking the things above where Christ is seated at the right
[time=777] hand of God. The second thing that a person must do to stay on track in the relationship
[time=784] of the Lord is found in verse two. Set your mind on things above, not on the things that
[time=791] are on the earth. For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ
[time=797] who is our life is revealed then you also will be revealed with Him in glory. It's profound.
[time=806] The place we are in this particular book as you remember in chapter one Paul declared the truth. He talked all about the gospel and all about the person of the gospel and the prayer of the gospel and the people of the gospel. And in chapter two he defended the truth and he said look you can't fall off into all this different false teaching and these heresies of philosophy and asceticism and legalism and mysticism. And now in chapter
[time=829] three he's going to start talking to us about living the truth, about not declaring it and not defending it but demonstrating it and living it out in our lives and making it effective and making it work in tangible ways. And before he jumps in to all that stuff he's going
[time=846] to say but the first place, I mean the point of origin, the point to begin has got to be seeking the things above. Something inside of you has got to continue to seek the things above. And secondly you've got to continue to control your mind the things you think about and allow them to be controlled by the things above not the things that are on the earth. And he's going to cover all that other stuff. Look at it, I mean where did I get
[time=872] the topics I raised this morning, right out of what he's going to talk about. Look at chapter three verse five, you've got problems with your basic desires, immorality, impurity,
[time=882] passion, evil desire and greed, you want to know why you have that problem because you've
[time=888] stopped seeking the things above and you've allowed your mind to focus on the things that
[time=894] are on the earth. Verse eight, problem in your relationships, you've got problem with anger
[time=900] and wrath and malice and slander and abusive speech and you're lying to one another, you
[time=907] want to know why? You stopped seeking the things above and you started letting your
[time=914] mind dwell on the things of the earth. You've got a problem with your character? Look at
[time=921] verse 12, you don't see a heart of compassion and kindness and humility and gentleness and patience and you're not willing to bear the other person's burden any longer, you're just out of whatever that stuff is that makes you a compassionate, kind, humility, humble, gentle, patient person. You want to know why? You want to know why you're out of that resource?
[time=940] You want to know why that characteristic is not in your life anymore because you stopped seeking God and you stopped keeping your mind focused on the things of God. You've got problems
[time=952] in your home. Look at verses 18, 19, 20, and 21. You're a problem with your wife. You
[time=958] as wives, you don't seem to be able to subject yourselves any longer to your husbands as hard and unreasonable as that may be in light of who they happen to be. You husbands find
[time=968] it difficult to love your wives and where there would be love, there is now an embittered spirit against them and you're angry with them and you've had it with them. Your children having trouble, being obedient to your parents and all things, are you fathers having trouble
[time=985] playing your role, continuing to give sacrificially or instead are you exasperating them? You want
[time=991] to know why? Because you stopped seeking God and you started to let your mind focus on
[time=997] the things of this world. The employment picture is in chapter three verses 20 to 25. It talks
[time=1003] about slaves and masters and the relationship there and your witness is found in chapter
[time=1009] four verse five. Conduct yourselves with wisdom towards those outside, making the most of the opportunity. Let your speech always be seasoned with grace as it were with salt so that you may know how you should respond to each person. See, there it is. In fact, that's like everything. I mean, what else is in life except that stuff? It's all predicated on
[time=1031] the fact that you seek God and that you set your mind on the things above, not on the
[time=1037] things that are on the earth. Before he will allow himself to talk specifically about the basic desires and relationships and character and employment and the whole, before he goes to that, he says, "Wait a minute. All that instruction is meaningless and it's pointless unless these two very fundamental realities are in place in your life. You've got to be
[time=1058] seeking God and you've got to be maintaining your mind on things above, not on things
[time=1064] of the earth." It's as if all of those represent dominoes, your relationships and your basic desires and your home and your employment, they're all dominoes, Christian dominoes in your Christian life. But the two that are in the front are what you're seeking and what you're thinking about. And if you can successfully topple those first two, they'll all collapse.
[time=1084] They'll all fall in line. It'll all happen like a chain reaction. But if you fail to
[time=1090] keep your heart after God and if you fail to control your thoughts, the rest of them will go amidst and untouched and unaffected by your Christianity, regardless of what
[time=1100] things you may do or not do. There is no way to live your Christian life. There is no way
[time=1110] to honor God. There is no way to pull this thing called Christianity off unless you keep
[time=1116] seeking the things above and unless you continue to control your mind and focus on things above
[time=1122] not on the things that are on the earth. And if you are struggling in anyone or all of those categories this morning, it is fundamentally because you have stopped seeking God and you
[time=1134] have stopped setting your mind on the things above. Now, obviously, having said that, it's time to talk about, okay, great, fine, thank you. Now, what does it mean to seek God?
[time=1146] What does it mean to set my mind on the things above? Talk to me about that. I mean, if this is so central, if this is where he starts, if before he will even talk to us about what it means to demonstrate truth in our life, he's got to make sure that we're seeking and we're setting. What are those things? Let me give you three things that I think it means to seek God as I studied the Word of God this week. To seek God or the things above, it
[time=1174] is the power, it is the power and it is the right and it is the privilege to determine
[time=1180] for yourself what you are about and what you are going to seek. Do you realize there is
[time=1187] a lot about you that you didn't get to choose? There's a lot about what constitutes your life
[time=1193] that you had no say in whatsoever. You didn't get to pick your sex. You didn't get to pick
[time=1199] your skin color. You didn't get to pick your IQ, your aptitude, your height, your hair color, your birth date, your parents or your children. Now, that's you. I mean, it's hard to think of things that are more central to who you are than those things. Your sex, your skin color, your IQ, your aptitude, your height, your hair color, your birth date, who birthed you and raised you and who you're now with to raise in life. You didn't get to pick
[time=1224] any of that stuff. All that's totally out of your control. So is the country you were born in. So is the century or span of time that you were going to live on this planet.
[time=1236] So are your emotions. Your emotions are not chosen. They are responses. So this is the
[time=1243] big one. You don't get to choose how people are going to treat you. Think about that.
[time=1248] You have absolutely no control over how people are going to respond to you. You may be able
[time=1255] to influence some of these things, but you are not in control. You cannot force any of these things. You can't control how much money you make. You might be able to make less, but you are not able to stand up one day and say I'm going to make $2 million this year and then go do it. $20 million. You don't get to pick where you want to live. Within certain limitations you get to pick where you live, but there are certain places you might like to live and would choose to live if it were truly in your power, but you know it isn't and so you can and so you don't. You get some choice in the matter. You get to influence some things, but you're not in control of that stuff. You see me? All the really important things about me, I don't get to choose. They're all outside of my power
[time=1295] to choose. My sex, skin color, IQ, height, hair, the whole line here, it's all outside of my control. But what this text says to you this morning is that in reality, the single
[time=1308] most important thing about you, you do get to choose and it is this, what are you going
[time=1315] to seek? What will you set your heart after? What will be important to you? Where will
[time=1326] you head? Given all the things that you didn't get to choose, notwithstanding, the one choice, the most in fact, the most important choice a person will ever make is totally within their power. What are you going to seek? This is a command here. It says, "Keep seeking
[time=1344] in verse one." And God doesn't tell you to do anything you can't do. He tells you to make that choice because it is your choice. First Chronicles 16 says, "Seek the Lord
[time=1355] and His strength. Seek His face continually." First Chronicles 22, 19, "Now set your heart
[time=1361] and your soul to seek the Lord." Second Chronicles 5, "And they entered in to a covenant to seek
[time=1370] the Lord of their fathers." I mean, they actually got down and made it a covenantal thing that
[time=1376] they were going to seek something. What is it? God. Which God? The God of their fathers.
[time=1383] In Hosea 10, 12, it says, "It is time to seek the Lord till He come and reign righteousness
[time=1389] upon you." Obviously, Hosea was a prophet of the nation of Israel. They had wandered
[time=1395] in their affections and in what they would seek. And they were seeking false gods and strange religions. And He said, "Stop it and seek the Lord." That is your choice. That is the thing about you that you do get to control. Don't abdicate that choice to anything other than the highest possible endeavor. Seek the Lord. I talk with people about their
[time=1417] Christianity and I talk to myself about my own and sometimes the response comes, "Yeah, but I don't feel like seeking God. You can't expect me to seek God because I don't feel
[time=1427] like seeking God. You can't expect me to seek God because I am not in the mood to be seeking
[time=1433] God." And the Word of God responds very gently but very truthfully, "You are not your feelings
[time=1440] and you are not your moods. You are principally what you choose to pursue." And regardless
[time=1449] of how you feel and regardless of your mood, you have the power to choose the direction
[time=1456] in which you will have. It's an amazing truth. It's very simple, I grant you, but it is one
[time=1462] that we go over all the time and we miss it and we start to think that our Christianity is the product of our feelings or our moods or our circumstances and it is none of those.
[time=1471] Our Christianity is the product of what we choose to seek. Now God has given us this
[time=1479] capacity and we have a remarkable ability to be self-aware. I mean, for example, you could try this. Go up there in your mind, sit up there in that dark corner over there and then look back at us and look back at yourself. You can get out there, can't you?
[time=1492] You can get out there in your head and you can look back and you can see this congregation.
[time=1496] You can see where you're sitting and how you're postured. Now animals don't do that. They can't do that. That's called being self-aware. That's what it means to be created in the image of God. You can right now assess your mood. You can step outside, look back inside
[time=1510] and say, "You know what? I'm in a bad mood today." And it feels like I'm grumpy and I'm out of sorts or you can say, "Man, I'm in a great mood today. I can't believe how happy I am." You can assess this about yourself. You can assess how well your mind is working
[time=1522] this morning. You're quick. You're alert or you're sluggish and you're barely with us.
[time=1527] You're able to get outside and look back in and say, "This is who I am. This is what I am." And fundamentally, you are able to get outside and say, "This is the direction
[time=1538] I am choosing. Do I like it or don't I like it? Is it the right direction or is it the wrong direction?" You don't have to be the slave of your appetites. You don't have to
[time=1549] be a responder to your circumstances. You can say, "I will seek the Lord God." That, by
[time=1561] the way, is hard to do. That's why he says here in this verse, "Keep seeking the things
[time=1568] above." It's not so hard to start seeking. It's not so hard when you've done your life
[time=1574] so bad and you've seen all the misery of sin and you've seen all that that stuff brings into your life. It's not so hard to repent of that and say, "I'm going to start seeking God." This is relatively easy. What is really, really hard is to continue to seek him all
[time=1589] the days of your life. And I mean seek him. I don't mean stay in the Christian domain.
[time=1595] I don't mean keep coming to church. I don't mean refuse to throw your Bible away. I mean continue to take the force of what you are and go after him with it. That is hard. And
[time=1607] if you struggle with it, and if you're sitting here this morning saying, "Man, he's on to this one," I am not seeking the things above. I got some of the problems he was mentioning about. And when I go just past those problems to take a little deeper look inside of me, there it is. There is a vacuum there. I am not seeking. That's okay. I mean, it's not okay. But that's pretty typical. That's pretty normal. That's why the command comes, keep seeking. Don't stop seeking. The temptation is to stop seeking God and the things of God.
[time=1637] But we have examples. I mean, Joseph, for example, Joseph started seeking God. Joseph
[time=1643] was born into a family that was seeking God. And Joseph got dreams about how God was going to use him. And what I find so remarkable about Joseph is that through thick and through thin,
[time=1653] he refused to stop seeking God. He gets sold, tried to be murdered, but then sold by his
[time=1659] brothers, goes to a foreign land, and his God is nowhere represented anywhere in this culture. I mean, it's just nothing about Jehovah. And somehow in the midst of that, he continues
[time=1670] to seek God. He gets brought into a place of tremendous privilege where everything he
[time=1677] touches turns to gold. And by the way, for his prosperity is the place where people most often stop seeking God. And he continues to seek God. And then he goes to remarkable
[time=1689] lengths to continue to seek him when he is being tempted sexually by this very seductive woman. I mean, he was just a bulldog. He just stayed on course and he sought God all the
[time=1701] days of his life. Thrown into prison, he keeps seeking God. Comes out of prison and rises
[time=1707] at the higher levels, keeps seeking God. Daniel, Daniel just did it all the time. All his
[time=1714] life. He never stopped seeking God. Came out of his Jewish homeland, was exiled, was put
[time=1721] under the most powerful brainwashing system known to man at that particular day by food and by training and by education and by language and by opulence and by promises of power.
[time=1732] And he says, I purposed in my heart. I purposed in my heart. I will seek God was the essence
[time=1740] of his purposing. And you'd think then that as time went on, he might have been prone
[time=1747] not to seek God, but there he is as an older man and those of his peers are jealous of him. And so they make a law that says if you pray to your God and Daniel sought God through prayer, Daniel 9 says that if you continue to seek God through prayer, you will die.
[time=1764] That's all right. No problem. I'll just keep kneeling. I'll just keep praying. I'll just stay on course. I will keep seeking the things above. Abraham, given certain promises, left
[time=1777] the land of Ur, left his family, left his culture, came to a foreign land. And there was more
[time=1783] than enough opportunity for Abraham to stop seeking God. He never possessed the land he was promised and he never even saw a child from his own lines with his wife until they were both past ability to do that. And all those lonely nights and all those lonely days
[time=1800] and all the questioning and all the wondering, where did God go? Why should I continue to seek a God who obviously is not going to fulfill his promises to me were too old to have kids and yet the Bible says he grew strong in faith. He grew strong in faith. He kept seeking God.
[time=1821] What's a remarkable thing? It is the starting point and it is the middle point and it is the finishing point of Christianity seeking God and it is a choice. The second thing that
[time=1834] I was kind of reminded of in my study this week about what it means to seek God is that it is done from the heart with a whole heart. You don't sort of seek God. You don't say,
[time=1846] "Oh, I get it. Okay, I'll add this idea of seeking God to everything else that I'm seeking.
[time=1852] It'll be one of the things I seek this week." Boy, I need to ratchet that up a few notches.
[time=1859] Jeremiah 29, 13, "And ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all
[time=1866] your heart." The heart as you know, to the Hebrew mind, was the core place where people
[time=1872] lived. I mean, it was the part of them that was them and if you don't seek me with who you really are and with all of who you really are, you will not find me. He doesn't buy in
[time=1883] for half-hearted searches. Psalm 119 2, "Blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that
[time=1889] seek him with the whole heart. With my whole heart have I sought thee oh, let me not wander
[time=1895] from thy commitment." Man, it's a core reality. It goes to the bottom of who these people are.
[time=1903] 2 Chronicles 15, "And they entered into a covenant to seek the Lord their God of the fathers with all their heart and with all their soul." I got to tell you, I think that this
[time=1920] is the hardest part of all of Christianity. There is nothing we are prone to do less and
[time=1928] there is nothing that is harder to do than to truly seek God from your heart with your
[time=1934] whole heart. There are a zillion distractions and there are a zillion reasons that we give
[time=1941] ourselves not to do it and there are a zillion ways to camouflage the fact that we don't do it. It has just got to be one of the hardest aspects of all of Christendom. To seek God,
[time=1955] to seek God from your heart and to seek God with your whole heart. At a loss for this reality
[time=1961] in my own life often I turn to another and read of his. There is a great preacher, Robert
[time=1967] Murray McShane, listen to an excerpt from his diary. He says, "I ought to pray before
[time=1973] seeing anyone. Often when I sleep long or meet with others early, it is 11 or 12 o'clock
[time=1981] before I begin secret prayer." This is a wretched system. It is unscriptural. Christ
[time=1990] arose before day and went into a solitary place. David says, "Early will I seek thee,
[time=1996] thou shalt early hear my voice." The conscience feels guilty. The soul unfed, the lamp not
[time=2004] trimmed. Then when in secret prayer the soul is often out of tune. I feel it is far better
[time=2011] to begin with God, to see his face first, to get my soul near him before it is near another.
[time=2018] Frankly, sometimes I find in my own life I feel this level of urgency more for my morning
[time=2026] coffee or my morning run than I do for my morning God. In other words, we know what
[time=2033] it means to have certain things in our life that have to be. Some people are more tied
[time=2040] to getting their morning coffee or their morning run or their morning time in front of a mirror. I mean that has a higher place of urgency and priority than this commitment
[time=2049] to seek God. And because we are Christians and because we believe the Bible, oh we just
[time=2058] kind of whitewashed the whole thing and we allow ourselves something other than a movement of our soul towards God every single day. Now I am not saying the first thing you have
[time=2069] to do every morning is get up and have one of these Robert Murray McShane prayer times.
[time=2072] I don't think it matters so much how you do it. It is a direction of the heart. It is a commitment of the heart. It is a giving of the heart to God. And there needs to be a getting up in the morning and there needs to be a saying, this is a day about what?
[time=2085] Surviving? This is a day about making money. This is a day about having fun. This is a
[time=2092] day about reducing conflict in my life. This is a day about trying not to think about how much I hate myself. This is a day about what I am going to get to eat. This is a day that
[time=2104] I am going to give myself utterly and completely from my heart to seeking God. I know that
[time=2112] sounds ethereal maybe. I am trying to make it as practice as I can but there is something inside of you that needs to go like this. And when it doesn't go like this, the rest
[time=2122] of the stuff may stay in place for a while but eventually the erosion comes. So seeking
[time=2128] God first of all is a choice. You are more than your feelings and your emotions. You are more than your desires. You are what you choose. And God calls you to choose to seek Him. Secondly, God calls you to choose to seek Him with your whole heart from the substance
[time=2143] of what you are. And thirdly, the Bible tells us that such choices bring great reward. Make
[time=2150] no mistake about it. If you will seek God, it says in Deuteronomy 4 29, but if you shall
[time=2157] seek the Lord your God, you shall find Him. If you seek Him with all your heart and with
[time=2164] all your soul. He doesn't play hide and seek. You seek Him with all your heart and with all
[time=2170] your soul, you are going to find Him. Proverbs 8 17, "Those that seek me early shall find me." Now I like the imagery here. "Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily
[time=2182] at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors." The imagery here is of someone who is so anxious
[time=2188] to find God that he waits on God and listens for God and watches for God. And it says,
[time=2195] "If there's a place where God is that he can't quite get to yet, but eventually God will come out in perusal where I can hear him or see him or find him. And I am at that point. I am at that place waiting expectantly, doing everything I can do to put myself in
[time=2208] position to be with God. He will meet you. He will meet you. Now I want to say that he
[time=2218] may not meet you in the way you want him to meet you. He may not meet you with the sense of overwhelming flooding joy that takes away all your problems and it's as if somebody just may line some cocaine into you and you're now into this wonderful marvel is God oblivion.
[time=2233] He may meet you with a profound conviction of your own sin. He may show up and when he
[time=2239] shows up and meets you after you have sought him the thing that may be most on his mind is your sin and your rebellion and your hard heart and he may meet you there with a profound but you know even that is good, isn't it? When you experience that humbling power of the
[time=2252] hand of God he may meet you in blessing. He may just show up with some remarkable blessing
[time=2258] that's unexpected and unprecedented and completely undeserved. He may greet you with adversity
[time=2265] and knowing what he knows about you and your place in life at this point what you need is adversity and so he may but he will meet you. If you seek him you will find him. If
[time=2276] you seek him you will find him. There's just no doubt about it.
[time=2284] What then does it mean to set your mind on things above? I mean if the first thing is seeking God what does it mean to set your mind on the things above and not on the things that are on the earth? Let me say it to you this way. I believe that there is a progression here. I believe that the first matter is a matter of seeking the things above. That's where this whole process starts. That's the first domino but the second domino that simply must fall is what you do with your mind. The mind is the place where ideas are nurtured
[time=2312] and reasoned and strengthened and defended and eventually acted upon. You cannot say
[time=2319] to yourself I am now going to set my heart on God but then continue to entertain a series
[time=2325] of thoughts and reasonings that are contrary to the things of God. That doesn't work.
[time=2334] That will never produce the growth that you are seeking. That will never revitalize your Christian life. To be revitalized in your Christian life you must determine to seek God and then also control your mind. And you must only think about certain things and
[time=2348] you must only think about certain things in certain ways all of which are in the category of what honors God and what is true and what is right and pure and lovely etc. This is
[time=2360] not promoting denial. This is promoting a very wholesome look at reality. And reality is if I spend all my time thinking about the negative stuff, if I spend all my time thinking
[time=2371] the thoughts about God, about my life, about people that are not honoring to God, reality is I will continue to sabotage my own Christian experience. That's reality. And what is reality
[time=2386] is then therefore how I think about those issues will eventually determine the quality and
[time=2393] the character of my Christian life. Proverbs 23.7 says it as a man thinks within himself
[time=2400] so is he. As a man thinks within himself so is he. It starts in your mind. There is this
[time=2410] setting of the heart on God and the very next most important thing is you control your mind
[time=2416] to think about the things which are right and pure and then the rest of this stuff can flow. You can gain control over the basic desires and you can gain control over how you relate to people and you can have a character that is full of compassion and you can have a home that functions at least as so far as your part in it is proper and you can be with your employer or employees as so much as your part is dependent in a way that honors God
[time=2442] and you can properly respond and have a heart to the unsafe. The Bible says it as I've said
[time=2450] as a man thinks within himself so is he. The world says it this way and they say it accurately.
[time=2454] So a thought reap an action. You plant thoughts in your mind you will eventually reap an action.
[time=2463] You sow an action and you will eventually reap a habit. You do that thing often enough and it will become a habit. You sow that habit long enough and you will reap a character.
[time=2475] You sow a character long enough and you will reap a destiny. As a man thinks within himself
[time=2482] so is he. So a thought reap an action. So an action reap a habit. So a habit reap a character.
[time=2487] So a character reap your destiny. You say wait a minute I didn't want my life to turn out this way. Yeah I know but but many many years ago or many many months ago you took your heart off God and then you allow your mind to think on the things of the earth and eventually it took its own course in your life and you produced your own destiny. The
[time=2508] collapse of your own Christian experience. How? By taking your heart off God and letting
[time=2514] your mind go places it shouldn't go. Hold there in Colossians 3 and come with me to Romans
[time=2520] for just a minute. You just can't escape Romans 1 and Romans 12 if you're going to talk about the mind. It just illustrates so powerfully the power that our mind has over our Christian
[time=2537] experience where I should say how critical and vital a part it is. You remember in Romans
[time=2544] chapter 1 verse 18 the wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. This is a great great chapter of terrible terrifying judgment of God and this judgment falls upon these men because they have failed to do the two
[time=2558] things that Colossians is saying. They have not sought God and they have not thought right thoughts. Here's the thought process he kind of starts with this in verse 18.
[time=2568] These men get the wrath of God because they have suppressed the truth in unrighteousness.
[time=2573] That is a mental activity. You do not do that with your hands. You do not do that with your emotions. You do not do that with your moods. You suppress the truth of God with your mind.
[time=2582] You say it isn't so. You reason, reason without the reason of God. You have a world view which
[time=2590] does not begin with what verses 19 and 20 says the reality of a creator namely that is God.
[time=2598] In thinking those thoughts verse 21 for even though they knew God they did not honor him
[time=2604] as God or give thanks. That's the seeking part. They saw him. They were aware of him
[time=2611] but with their mind they said no. We do not accept that he is there and therefore with
[time=2617] our hearts we will not honor him as God and we will not give thanks to him. And then the
[time=2623] cycle begins. Look at it at the universe 20 but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened professing to be wise. They became fools and they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for an image in the form of corruptible man. That is a mental activity. They are futile in their speculations. That is a mental activity.
[time=2642] And so you say well but what happened to their life? I mean okay I get it. They did not honor God. I mean they didn't seek God and they didn't think right thoughts. They thought bad thoughts. Well what happened? Well look at it. Verse 24. God gave them over
[time=2657] in the lusts of their hearts to the impurity that their bodies might be dishonored among them. They committed all kinds of fornication and adultery. And then verse 26. Oh look at
[time=2669] verse 25 before you get there. Why? Again he just keeps saying it. For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie. Did that happen because they were genetically committed to adultery? No. Did that happen because circumstances in their life forced them to commit it over?
[time=2682] No. Did that happen because their wife was really mean to them and they were lonely and so they ran out and had a don't know it is because they did not think the right thoughts about God. They allowed their mind to conceive things that were not true and they allowed
[time=2698] their mind to conceive plots and plans of satisfaction outside of seeking God and eventually he gave it to them. Verse 26. What happened next? Well for this reason God gave them over
[time=2710] to degrading passions. And this is that whole weird thing about homosexuality. Why'd all
[time=2717] that happen? Look at verse 28. Just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer.
[time=2725] They will not seek God and they will not think right thoughts about God and so it begins to reflect itself in their behavior and now they have no mind. Verse 28. God gave them
[time=2735] over to a depraved mind to do those things which are not proper. They did it so long and so completely and so thoroughly that they don't have a mind anymore. In other words they just they can't tell right from wrong. They lose their powers of discretion and look at their life. Verse 29. Here it comes on righteousness, wickedness, greed, evil, full of envy and murder and strife and deceit and malice and gossip and slander. Their haters
[time=2759] of God, their insulin, arrogant, boastful and vineyards of evil, disobedient to parents, no understanding, untrustworthy, unloving and unmerciful. Why'd all that happen to them?
[time=2769] Why are they like that? How did they get down that road so far? Two things. They chose
[time=2777] not to seek God and they allowed their minds to think things that they shouldn't have allowed
[time=2783] their minds to think. It's just obvious and you and I among the redeemed, among the redeemed
[time=2792] though we can never be re-entered into the kingdom of darkness and lose our salvation but you and I can do the same ridiculous stupid thing and we can stop seeking God and we can
[time=2803] start thinking thoughts that will eventually turn into actions and habits and characters and destiny. Chapter 12. You want to revitalize your Christian life. You don't like what
[time=2818] you see. It's not going in the right direction. How do I do this? Well Romans 12 you know these
[time=2827] two verses. I urge you therefore brethren by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living and a holy sacrifice acceptable to God which is your spiritual service of worship
[time=2837] and do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
[time=2842] Listen to this. I want to give my body to God. I mean I want to give my earthly existence to God. That's what that's about. Verse 1. I want to give my earthly existence all to God and I don't want to be conformed to the world. I don't want to continue to fall into the patterns and the behavior of the world. I want to be transformed into the image of
[time=2862] Jesus Christ. How do I do all that stuff? By the renewing of your mind. By the renewing
[time=2869] of your mind. What you think about. What you meditate on. What you allow your mind to take in. What you feed your mind with. There is just this inextricable connection
[time=2881] between what you think about. What you take in and what you eventually do and then become.
[time=2889] And it is an enormous responsibility. Back to Colossians 3. So it's a rather simple text.
[time=2904] It is the gateway to all of Christian behavior as he relates it in the rest of chapter 3 and chapter 4. And by its very positioning here we cannot escape the conclusion that
[time=2915] all of our Christian strength and vitality and energy and direction come from these basic
[time=2922] things of seeking God and setting your mind on things that are proper. Now as we close
[time=2931] let me just try to be a little more practical here on each point. Two questions for you.
[time=2939] Number one. As far as seeking God. Answer this question. What are the three things you
[time=2946] love or want the most? You have to write this down and hand it in. But in your mind answer
[time=2956] that, will you? Just shut everybody out. What are the three things that I want the most
[time=2965] to happen? Or that I love the most? That I, in my soul, you go to the bottom of what
[time=2971] I am. This is, what's there? Let me tell you something. If it isn't seeking God, if it
[time=2980] isn't the person of God or Christ or the kingdom of God or winning people to Christ or honoring
[time=2986] God in your relationship. I mean if that isn't at the core of what you are do not make the fatal mistake of then saying see that's what I really, what I really, really want is just
[time=2997] what I really, really want and so that's what I want and so that's who I am and so that's how it's going to go. Don't make that mistake. That is a lie right out of hell. If you ask
[time=3008] that question and you find out that at the core of what you are it is not what it ought to be. Don't be a victim of what it shouldn't be. Change it. Just change it. Just say and
[time=3023] mean I will seek God. I reject, I repent, I turn from the pursuit of anything other than
[time=3033] God and I will seek him with my whole heart. You say well, you just tell me to do that?
[time=3038] Am I supposed to just do that? Yes. You're supposed to just do that because the Bible tells you to just do that. You get it? That's part of what it is under your control. You
[time=3048] get to control what you seek. You get to control what you pursue. You get to control what you really want. So set the right stuff at the bull's eye. I don't know how else to say it.
[time=3062] It's a choice that you get to make by your own volitional powers. Don't give it away.
[time=3068] And when you look and you find that the right stuff isn't there, please don't be a victim of that bad stuff. Don't pretend for a minute that you have to succumb to whatever that is.
[time=3079] Stand up. Be an image bearer made in the image of God and say I have the right and the power
[time=3087] and the privilege and the responsibility to say what I will seek and I am going to seek
[time=3094] God. Number two. This relates to your mind. You know how when your mind isn't occupied?
[time=3104] I mean you're not trying to figure out what button to push to dial the phone or you're not answering a question from somebody at work or you're not involved with somebody at the house there. I mean you have a free moment and your mind is free to think whatever it wants to think. What does it think about? What are you thinking about when you get
[time=3123] to think about whatever you want to think about? You turn the music on and you sit there in the quiet. You're driving and you get to sit there in the quiet. Wherever that is you're
[time=3133] cutting your lawn and which we get to do here pretty soon and you're thinking about whatever you want to think about. What do you think about? That will tell you more about what
[time=3143] your desires are than anything because there's this connection. And my call to you based upon
[time=3152] the word of God today is to set your mind on the things above not on the things of earth.
[time=3159] You have got to put stop signs up and you have got to put roadblocks up when your mind wants to move into ways of thinking about things which do not honor God. That my friends
[time=3171] is your choice. You get to choose what you think about. Your parents don't determine that. Your grandparents don't determine that. Your environment doesn't determine that.
[time=3179] Your circumstances don't determine that. Nothing determines that but you and boy will it determine a lot about you as time goes on. So you say jump start me. Help me. I'm flat. I'm out
[time=3195] of gas. What do I do? Tell me how to get going again. Seek God. It's a choice. Do it with
[time=3204] all your heart and expect the reward of his meeting you. Secondly set your mind. Control
[time=3211] it. Focus it. Work it. Feed it and protect it. Off of sinful things and on to godly things.
[time=3218] Let me take you a minute and close. Would you come to Philippians 3 again? We were there last week but if when you were opening your heart and saying what's really there, this
[time=3233] is really what you should have found. Paul this remarkably successful, competent, brilliant
[time=3240] man of high esteem and reputation in his day and in his culture says this in verse 8. More than that I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing Christ
[time=3251] Jesus my Lord. Would you please notice he did not talk about the value of being a Christian
[time=3257] in the generic, the value of coming to church, the value of owning a Bible, the value of being able to pray. He talked about the value of being in a face to face personal relationship
[time=3268] with Christ. That's what it means to seek God from your heart. You are face to face moment by moment day by day in an ongoing love relationship with a person whose name is Christ. If you
[time=3280] are experiencing less, keep working. Keep shutting other things out. Keep pursuing the
[time=3287] person of Christ. He says in verse 10 that I may know him, not know about him, not know
[time=3295] the ins and outs of this religion, not know the ins and outs of the Bible, not know the ins and outs of anything else other than him, a deep, intimate personal knowledge of Christ.
[time=3306] I pray that if you are anywhere on this continuum, short of right on track, that you will take
[time=3317] these two things to heart and honestly exercise the power that is yours as an image bear and
[time=3324] choose Christ and choose to think about the things of Christ and let these other dominoes
[time=3330] fall out of that first and second response. Let's pray together.
[time=3345] Well, I want to take a minute here as this program comes to an end and talk to those
[time=3352] of you who have never accepted Christ as your personal Lord and Savior. And as you've been
[time=3358] listening this morning, you recognize that what God wants from the believer is for that
[time=3364] believer to seek him, to make him the priority of his or her life and to do that with a whole
[time=3371] heart and then to use this marvelous thing called our minds as we plan and scheme and
[time=3378] dream and imagine the way our life will go to do that in a way that honors God and God
[time=3385] promises unbelievable reward for that. Personal joy and peace and encouragement and strength
[time=3393] and all kinds of direction in terms of how we treat other people and relationships and
[time=3399] marriages and children and the whole nine yards. And maybe you're sitting there listening
[time=3406] to this, watching this, recognizing that there is a tremendous amount of turmoil in your life, there's trouble in your life and you know that it's in part because you have never
[time=3417] really turned your life over to God and sought him and used your mind to glorify and honor
[time=3423] him with your life. So I want to invite you to pray a prayer right now and accept Christ
[time=3429] as your personal Lord and Savior and turn your life over to God. And as I say this out loud, you say it in your heart and God will hear you and if you mean it he'll accept you into
[time=3440] his family forgive you through Christ. So I encourage you now just to bow your head, close your eyes and say in your heart what I'm saying out loud. My Heavenly Father I
[time=3450] know that I am a sinner, I know that I have violated your law, I know that I do not seek
[time=3456] you with my whole heart and my mind is often thinking thoughts that are contrary to who
[time=3462] and what you are. I confess that sin to you and I ask you to forgive me in the name of
[time=3468] Jesus Christ, to wash and cleanse me, to give me new life in Christ that I might live forever
[time=3474] seeking you and using my mind to honor you in all that I do and say. Thank you for hearing
[time=3480] my prayer in Jesus name, amen. Well, write us won't you and let us know about your decision.
