[time=0] The question is, and maybe this is one that you're having this morning, is why don't
[time=7] I believe that?
[time=9] I mean, I know that.
[time=11] I could answer a test question or two and probably get right most of what you said.
[time=17] I know it.
[time=18] The question is, why do I have so much trouble believing it and committing myself to it and
[time=25] entrusting my life to the person of Christ?
[time=34] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=38] We're so glad you've joined us.
[time=40] What is it that keeps people from committing their lives to Christ?
[time=44] Why is it that people hold back from accepting Christ as their personal Lord and Savior?
[time=49] We'll stay with us today as Pastor Moore explains the three Roblox to Christ.
[time=79] The name of Christ, but one by one they chose to lie. The Son of God, they would not deny.
[time=97] They're the great and gently quietest things I can almost hear their voices sing.
[time=111] I pledge all allegiance to the land with all my strength, with all I am.
[time=124] I will see to honor his comments, my pledge all allegiance to the land.
[time=149] Now the years have come, and the years have gone, and the cause of Jesus still goes on.
[time=162] Now a time has come to count the cost, to reject this world, to embrace the cross.
[time=176] And one by one let us live our lives, for the one who died to give us life.
[time=189] To the trumpet sounds of the final day, let us proudly stand and boldly sing.
[time=202] I pledge all allegiance to the land with all my strength, with all I am.
[time=215] I will see to honor his comments, my pledge all allegiance to the land,
[time=232] to the land of God, who bore my faith, who tore my faith, who bore the shame.
[time=247] I will see to honor his comments, my pledge all allegiance to the land.
[time=261] The land.
[time=267] I pledge all allegiance to the land with all my strength, with all I am.
[time=281] I will see to honor his comments, my pledge all allegiance to the land.
[time=294] I pledge all allegiance to the land with all my strength, with all I am.
[time=307] I will see to honor his comments, my pledge all allegiance to the land,
[time=326] to the land, to the land.
[time=343] Once upon a time, there was a family who lived in the land called these parts.
[time=355] There was the dad, the mother, and the child.
[time=361] For as long as anyone could remember, everyone who lived in these parts had a patch on one eye.
[time=375] And one arm in a sling.
[time=385] Now also living in the land were important advisors.
[time=390] There was the scientist, the scholar, and the doctor.
[time=398] Unfortunately, the people in these parts were part persons because of their patches, pads, and slings.
[time=406] But they had been part persons for so long, they hardly even noticed.
[time=411] That is until one day when a stranger came into town.
[time=416] Hello everyone, I'm a stranger to these parts.
[time=421] Mommy, what's a stranger?
[time=424] Well, sweetheart, it's someone who's well who's strange.
[time=430] And the stranger was different.
[time=432] He had no patch on his eye, no pad on his ear, and he could hug with both arms.
[time=439] Folks, I have great news for the people living in these parts.
[time=444] You don't have to be half blind, half deaf, and walk around with your arm in a sling anymore.
[time=450] I can make you whole.
[time=452] The people in these parts gasped at the startling news.
[time=458] Now, wait a minute.
[time=460] You need to tell me you can make me see with two eyes.
[time=464] And here with two ears.
[time=466] And hug with two arms.
[time=469] Precisely, and I can do even more than that.
[time=472] You see, you're not just part people on the outside, but part people on the inside too.
[time=478] But I can change all that.
[time=481] I don't know.
[time=482] Change sounds pretty scary.
[time=484] I've gotten along just fine with one eye.
[time=487] What do I need another one for?
[time=489] Mommy, why do I have to keep wearing the sling?
[time=492] Oh, you don't, sweetheart.
[time=494] Just follow me.
[time=496] Now, wait just a minute, Mr. Who do you think you are coming here?
[time=500] Trying to poison our children with your empty promises.
[time=503] My promises are real.
[time=505] I come from a holy land where everyone is whole.
[time=509] And so they turn to the experts, those learned advisors for guidance.
[time=515] Mr. Scientist, tell us, can a person use two eyes, two ears, and both arms?
[time=524] Well, I've done calculations and consulted all known laws of physics.
[time=530] And I've concluded it's impossible, so it can't happen.
[time=536] Ms. Historian, I've studied ancient cultures and scoured the pages of recorded history.
[time=544] And I'm afraid it's never happened before.
[time=547] So it never happens.
[time=551] And what do you think, doctor?
[time=554] I've examined many patients and kept accurate charts.
[time=558] And I'm afraid it's biologically unprecedented.
[time=561] So it doesn't happen.
[time=563] No, no, no, no.
[time=564] Do you prefer to be blind?
[time=566] Is it really that wonderful to be deaf?
[time=569] Are we going to stand here and let this stranger insult us?
[time=573] Young man, you're not wanted here.
[time=575] You're upsetting the masses.
[time=577] Your words can be stabilized civilization as we know it.
[time=580] Let's get him out of here.
[time=582] And so they set upon the stranger with the full force of their fury.
[time=586] So you want us to have two eyes, huh?
[time=589] Let's see how well you do without any eyes.
[time=592] Can you hear betterness?
[time=594] Well, just scream in your ears until you can't hear at all!
[time=597] You don't think I'm doing a good enough job loving my family?
[time=600] Well, see how much you can do with your arms broken!
[time=603] In their rage, no one bothered to notice that every quality the stranger had promised,
[time=615] he also possessed.
[time=617] All they could think about was getting rid of his disquieting presence.
[time=621] And before they even knew what they were doing, they had killed the stranger.
[time=628] Well, he deserved it, you know.
[time=644] I couldn't really see what was happening.
[time=647] Did you hear anything?
[time=649] I only have one arm.
[time=651] Surely it wasn't my blow that...
[time=654] Mommy.
[time=657] Almost as quickly as the tragedy happens, the family returned to life as usual in these parts.
[time=663] No one wanted to talk about the stranger or what they had done to him.
[time=668] No one that is except...
[time=670] Hello, everyone. I'm back.
[time=673] They couldn't believe their eye!
[time=680] Who are you?
[time=682] Well, you don't know.
[time=683] But you look like...
[time=684] I am.
[time=685] But we...
[time=686] You're right.
[time=687] But how?
[time=688] That's a good question.
[time=689] But that's...
[time=690] That's exactly right.
[time=691] But I've done calculations.
[time=693] I've studied civilizations.
[time=695] I've examined many patients.
[time=697] That laws I've looked.
[time=698] I've opened books.
[time=699] Their pulse I took.
[time=700] It can't happen.
[time=702] It never happened.
[time=703] It doesn't happen.
[time=705] It didn't happen. Look, it's not very scientific or scholarly or therapeutic to ignore the evidence.
[time=715] Look, I'm here.
[time=717] Come on, dear. Let's get out of here.
[time=719] We shouldn't listen to wackos like this.
[time=722] Dead men living.
[time=724] Impossible.
[time=725] Pre-posters.
[time=727] Unnatural.
[time=734] Hey, mister.
[time=736] Are you sure you're alive?
[time=740] Well, what do you think?
[time=742] Well, you look okay.
[time=744] But I'm just a kid.
[time=745] What do I know?
[time=746] You know plenty.
[time=748] Aren't you pretty mad at mom and dad after what they did to you?
[time=752] You know, this is going to be a little hard to believe.
[time=755] But my offer still stands for them.
[time=757] And for you too.
[time=760] Would you like my help?
[time=763] Yeah.
[time=764] Yeah, would.
[time=765] Alright then.
[time=766] What do you say when you start with that sling?
[time=769] Okay.
[time=770] There.
[time=776] What do you think?
[time=778] You're right.
[time=782] It does feel better to have with both arms.
[time=792] Hallelujah.
[time=796] Jesus is alive.
[time=799] Death has lost his victory.
[time=802] And the brave has been denied.
[time=806] Jesus wins forever.
[time=808] He's alive.
[time=815] He's the alpha and omega.
[time=819] The first and last is thee.
[time=822] The first of sin is broken.
[time=825] And we have perfect liberty.
[time=829] The Lamb of God has risen.
[time=832] He's alive.
[time=838] Hallelujah.
[time=842] Jesus is alive.
[time=846] Death has lost his victory.
[time=849] And the brave has been denied.
[time=853] Jesus wins forever.
[time=855] He's alive.
[time=867] He's the alpha and omega.
[time=872] The first and last is thee.
[time=875] The first of sin is broken.
[time=878] And we have perfect liberty.
[time=882] The Lamb of God has risen.
[time=885] He's alive.
[time=898] Hallelujah.
[time=902] Jesus is alive.
[time=906] Death has lost his victory.
[time=909] And the brave has been denied.
[time=913] Jesus wins forever.
[time=915] He's alive.
[time=922] He's the alpha and omega.
[time=926] The first who has risen.
[time=929] The first of sin is broken.
[time=932] And we have perfect liberty.
[time=936] The Lamb of God has risen.
[time=939] He's alive.
[time=945] Hallelujah.
[time=948] Jesus is alive.
[time=952] Hallelujah.
[time=955] Jesus is alive.
[time=960] He's alive.
[time=965] (Applause) Well, there's really no question that the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ is the single greatest truth in all of Christianity.
[time=978] Most of us know that.
[time=981] Every time I come to Easter, I am reminded of a good friend who lives back in California where I used to live.
[time=986] His name is Doug Sedam, and he had the courage, and he trusted me enough to over a meal.
[time=994] We were traveling together on our way to go skiing somewhere for the Easter break.
[time=999] To ask a question, he'd never asked anybody else before in his entire life to my knowledge.
[time=1005] He admitted to me that because he had been raised by his mother who was a Buddhist, that every year he'd come around to Easter and never really know what Easter was about.
[time=1016] And he asked me, "What is the real meaning behind Easter?" And in so many words, I said, "Doug, man has sinned against God and created a terrible problem in the relationship between man and God." And then comes Christmas.
[time=1034] God, in the form of Jesus Christ, took on the form of human man so he could live among us.
[time=1041] And then comes good Friday.
[time=1044] That's the day that Jesus was crucified on the cross to pay the price for our sin.
[time=1050] And then comes Easter.
[time=1053] And that's the day when Jesus Christ rose from the dead and proved two things.
[time=1059] The first was that he is who he said he is.
[time=1063] That he is who he said he was.
[time=1065] He was true in living God because mere mortals don't say they're going to die and then die and then buy their own power come back from the dead.
[time=1073] Only the true living God in the form of human flesh does that.
[time=1078] The second thing that the resurrection proves is that God was satisfied with the payment of Christ on the cross for sin.
[time=1088] It was proven that the power of death and the power of sin could not hold Christ in the grave because his sacrifice was complete and it satisfied God.
[time=1099] The other part about Easter is this.
[time=1102] Anyone who believes those facts, that historical fact of the resurrection, anyone who puts their faith in the person of Jesus Christ can have their sins forgiven and they can be made right with God.
[time=1118] And as I have said to him, I have said to you.
[time=1121] The question that I posed this morning isn't so much what's the meaning of Easter?
[time=1126] Most of us know that.
[time=1127] The question is this.
[time=1128] And maybe you're asking this in your own mind and your own heart this morning.
[time=1132] Why don't I believe it?
[time=1136] I know the facts.
[time=1138] Why don't they make sense to me?
[time=1140] Why can't I commit my life to Christ as others have?
[time=1146] You may be asking yourself that question this morning and I want to take a stab at answering it.
[time=1152] It may be even as the drama presented that you have been listening to the scientists and the historians and the doctors and you may object to it on a purely intellectual basis saying that it is impossible for a human being to have died and then come back from the dead.
[time=1170] And I would grant you that there are a great number.
[time=1173] In fact, the vast majority of what we'll call learned and scholar people in our country who would be saying to you as much.
[time=1182] However, there is another side to that story.
[time=1185] There are a great number of highly qualified scholars, scientists and doctors and historians who would say to you that the reality of the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ is as identifiable as provable and historic event as any other that we commonly believe and understand.
[time=1207] In other words, if you are comfortable believing the notion that Columbus discovered America, which I certainly do, if you are comfortable believing the notion that there was a man named Napoleon or that the Caesar's ruled Rome, there is as much or more historical evidence to prove the fact that Jesus Christ lived and died and rose from the dead.
[time=1229] And I could literally overwhelm you with references and quotes of great scholars who have lived who study history and who study what they call historicity the believability of an event in the past.
[time=1245] I'll give you just one, this is from Thomas Arnold, who held the chair of modern history at Oxford and was the author of the famous three-volume work, History of Rome. He said this quote, "I have been used for many years to study the histories of other times and to examine and weigh the evidence of those who have written about them.
[time=1266] And I know of no one fact in the history of mankind which is proved by better and fuller evidence of every sort to the understanding of a fair enquirer than the great sign which God has given us that Christ died and rose again from the dead."
[time=1286] The value of the evidence is unquestionable and those pieces of evidence which come together, as I have said, to prove historic events like the discovering of America, et cetera, et cetera, are no better than the kinds of evidence that prove the reality that a man named Jesus lived and died and rose from the dead.
[time=1308] So there is a possibility that you are stumbling over committing yourself to the person of Christ to this point in your life on that basis.
[time=1319] But I suggest that there may be more compelling reasons that hold you back. There may be other determining factors which keep you from committing your life to Christ.
[time=1330] And I'd like to think about them under the titles of the patch, the pad, and the sling.
[time=1339] What do I mean by the patch?
[time=1341] Well, you and I know in the normal physical realm that when you only have one eye, you are indeed capable of recognizing certain objects.
[time=1351] The problem is one of depth perception.
[time=1354] We have two eyes and as they're separated by a little bit, they give us an angle at the particular object we're looking at and the brain is able to compute that stuff into an idea we call depth perception.
[time=1365] How far away is it? How thick is it?
[time=1368] But when you only have one eye, it's very, very difficult in that category.
[time=1373] And the Scriptures tell us that we have a spiritual depth perception problem.
[time=1378] It is as if the spiritual sensors in our lives are covered by a patch leaving us, well, we can recognize certain problems in our lives and in our society, but we have a tremendous difficulty seeing to the depth or the root of that particular problem, thus coming up with solutions is very difficult.
[time=1400] We might look at our own lives and understand that when we lie, or when we cheat, or when we steal, or when we are selfish, or when we are deceptive, we can recognize that object as something that's wrong in our spiritual view.
[time=1417] And we chalk it up to a number of different things.
[time=1421] Maybe it was just a character lapse.
[time=1423] Maybe it was just a weak moment.
[time=1426] Maybe it was our parents who raised us in certain ways to have certain propensities, to do certain kinds of things.
[time=1434] Others might explain it as being a genetic problem coming down through the gene pool.
[time=1439] And it may be parts of those things.
[time=1443] But the Word of God would say that there is a deeper, more perceptive, more insightful understanding of that sin in our lives.
[time=1452] It is, in fact, more than our gene problem.
[time=1455] It is, in fact, more than the way our parents raised us.
[time=1458] It is, in fact, more than a set of circumstances which test and try us, and we finally give in in the moment of weakness.
[time=1466] The Bible says in Jeremiah 17-9 that the heart is more deceitful than all else, and is desperately sick.
[time=1476] And who can understand it?
[time=1479] One of the things that may be keeping you from embracing the person of Jesus Christ so far in your life is you have a tremendous difficulty perceiving and admitting to yourself that the problem of your life goes far deeper.
[time=1496] It goes all the way to your heart.
[time=1498] And something in you has a gravitational pull that's going south.
[time=1503] There's something wrong at the heart level in you and in me.
[time=1509] What about the pad?
[time=1517] What kind of an obstacle does the pad present?
[time=1520] Well, in the physical, natural realm when you have a pad or you can only hear from one ear, you have a problem with what they call directionality.
[time=1530] Because only one ear is functioning.
[time=1532] It's very difficult when a sound occurs to determine how far away that sound happened or which direction it came from.
[time=1539] With two ears, I learned this week speaking with a medical doctor.
[time=1543] When a sound comes from its originating source, we not only hear it directly from the source, but our ears are able because there's two to pick up the way that it bounces and reverberates against things, whether it be the walls of this room, or if you're outside bouncing off trees or buildings, and it gives the hearer the capacity and the ability to learn an enormous amount of information.
[time=1567] How loud, how far away, is it approaching, is it retreating?
[time=1572] The scriptures tell us that in the spiritual dimension, we have a similar problem.
[time=1576] It's as if we have a pad that closes the ears of our spiritual understanding.
[time=1582] And we have trouble hearing a couple of things.
[time=1585] One is our own conscience, our own conscience.
[time=1590] The Bible says that God has given each one of us a conscience, Romans 2, 15, and the conscience I'm quoting, bears witness and our thoughts alternately accuse or else defend us so we can know right from wrong.
[time=1606] This idea of a witness, the conscience bears witness.
[time=1609] It's the actual word that would be for a person coming into court to bring testimony.
[time=1615] And that voice is set straight by the moral law of God.
[time=1621] And when we do something that voice speaks to us and it says you're doing right, you're doing something that is helpful, it is good to pursue this path.
[time=1630] Or we pick a different path and that voice begins to say no, that is not a viable option, that is outside of what would be considered healthy and right and moral.
[time=1641] What happens is as we continue to run that conscience over, we have a deafening problem and we can no longer hear the voice of conscience as clearly today as we would have a year before or two years or three years and we can actually find ourselves involved today in activity which before we would have considered unconscionable.
[time=1664] But we can't hear it as good anymore.
[time=1668] And you may find that happening to you in your life.
[time=1670] You're able to participate in things and do things and say things and be places that before you wouldn't have allowed yourself, the voice inside wouldn't have permitted even those kinds of activities.
[time=1683] But you're having trouble hearing him.
[time=1686] Over time there's a deafening that's going on.
[time=1691] It's just a small faint cry now and you're easy to overcome it.
[time=1697] The other thing that the Bible tells us we have a tremendous time hearing, difficulty hearing, is the very voice of God calling to us
[time=1707] that he loves us.
[time=1710] We have trouble hearing that.
[time=1712] He is shouting it through creation.
[time=1716] The Bible tells us that when we look at the beauty of God's creation, the stars and the trees and the grass and the rolling hills and the wonder of a bird and a hummingbird, kind of the beauty and the intricacy of one of these little of God's, it is as if God is yelling to us.
[time=1735] I exist and I care about you and I love you.
[time=1741] But the deafening process goes on because we find ourselves so much more
[time=1747] in tune with other things.
[time=1750] It's as if we've turned the dial of our receptor to a different station and now it's just a faint.
[time=1757] We want to say there is no God as a culture.
[time=1760] We want to say he didn't create all that stuff and we want to shut him up or deafen him and his voice out of our lives and say no, it was all time plus chance in this thing called evolution.
[time=1772] And then we dial in real tight on other pursuits and that emptiness that we feel inside instead of going to God to have him work and help and support us in that sense of loneliness and the lack of satisfaction with every human being experiences from time to time.
[time=1788] We run over to a new house or we dial into a new car or a new career or a new hobby or a new person.
[time=1796] And we're so tuned into hearing that we can hardly hear God's voice any longer.
[time=1803] But he's still beckoning.
[time=1805] Isaiah 55, he says this, "Why do you spend your money for what is not bread?"
[time=1811] And your wages for what does not satisfy.
[time=1814] You can hear him crying out to us saying don't go after those things.
[time=1817] I mean, they don't really satisfy.
[time=1819] They won't really address the issue in your life, the emptiness, the loneliness, the longing for a quality of life.
[time=1827] And if you lived it all, you know it.
[time=1829] You're always needing a bigger one, a faster one, the latest model.
[time=1834] Why are you spending your money for that stuff?
[time=1837] Why are you buying things that look satisfying but which aren't?
[time=1840] Then he says this, he says this is a quote, Isaiah 55.
[time=1843] Listen carefully to me and eat what is good.
[time=1848] In climb your ear and come to me, listen that you may live.
[time=1856] He is standing here this morning.
[time=1860] He is speaking to you this morning and saying what is it that keeps you from coming to the cross and accepting Christ as your Savior?
[time=1869] One of the issues is there's a patch and there's impaired vision.
[time=1873] There's a depth perception problem.
[time=1875] Let me tell you friend, the problem goes all the way to the heart level.
[time=1879] We're corrupt people.
[time=1884] He's saying there's a hearing problem.
[time=1887] You're losing your ability to hear the conscience that I gave you which only compounds the sin problem and you're running more freely into things which you think will satisfy but they are illusions as though in the desert and you run after them when you find them and grasp them they're nothing but sand and they don't improve at all the quality of
[time=1908] your life.
[time=1910] Listen to me he says, listen that you may live.
[time=1916] Well the patch, the pad and the sling as the drama pointed out, man I feel like I'm only
[time=1922] hugging with one arm.
[time=1927] You know inside the relationships of our lives I think we're all looking for a more meaningful contact there.
[time=1934] It kind of feels like we're being hugged with one arm and it feels as if we're only able to hug with one arm.
[time=1941] Most of us are, the Bible tells us all of us are relationally handicapped.
[time=1948] There's an impairment that keeps us from really being able to grab all of each other and love each other and be committed to each other and trust each other and serve each other.
[time=1958] We can sense we were built for that but man it's just a little shaky it just something stands in my way.
[time=1964] There's something about that other person and there's something about me that keeps us from really grabbing a hold of each other in meaningful relationship.
[time=1975] You're wishing for more in your relationship with your spouse.
[time=1979] You may not even be able to define it but you know it's getting colder over time.
[time=1985] You're wishing for more in your relationship with your kids.
[time=1988] They're your own flesh and blood but somehow some way the friction always comes and the distance just keeps getting bigger and bigger.
[time=1997] Friends that you really want to be able to confide in and trust, trust to know that they'll be
[time=2003] there for you when you need them and yet they're not and you find neither are you for them.
[time=2008] It's sporadic at best. Bible tells us that we are relationally handicapped.
[time=2014] It describes us as being people that are envious and we slander one another and we are angry with one another and we are jealous against one another and we have evil desires for one another and we are greedy which keeps us from really loving each other.
[time=2030] And Christ is saying hey let's take that sling off and let's start to learn how to
[time=2036] love each other with both arms.
[time=2039] The Bible describes that this way put on a heart of compassion.
[time=2042] Think about these qualities in your life, compassion and kindness, humility, gentleness and patience.
[time=2048] It goes on to say we can bear with one another.
[time=2051] The word bear means to carry somebody else's burden.
[time=2054] Even the parts about them that we don't like and that irritate us.
[time=2057] Christ says let me get that sling off and we can start carrying each other's burdens.
[time=2061] And we can start forgiving one another.
[time=2067] He wants to free us.
[time=2072] Well because we all kind of live in these parts and it's hard for us to really see as
[time=2080] clearly as we should or hear as clearly as we should and feel as deeply as we might.
[time=2088] God has done a very, very loving thing.
[time=2091] God is in the process, the Bible tells us of issuing personal wake up calls to people
[time=2098] who don't see very well and hear very well and hug very well.
[time=2101] Even to this day God is in the business of intersecting with your life and my life
[time=2108] in ways that kind of wake us up.
[time=2111] Give us a sense that we're not seeing as clearly, hearing as well, feeling as deeply as we could.
[time=2120] And if you'd allow me this morning I'd like to share three of them with you and maybe you'll be able to recognize this morning God really does love you and He really is pursuing you through these wake up calls.
[time=2133] The first one, God issues personal wake up calls through trials, through crisis, through
[time=2142] the loss of a loved one, through some heartbreak in life.
[time=2146] Now please I did not say that God creates those crises but in the midst of those crises
[time=2152] He is speaking and calling to you.
[time=2157] Somehow, someway in the middle of a heartbreak or a trial or a loss, we lose our sense of
[time=2164] personal invincibility and we become vulnerable.
[time=2168] Our defenses are dropped just a bit, our pride is deflated.
[time=2172] The feeling of invincibility fades just ever so slightly and the air of self-sufficiency
[time=2179] clears for just a moment.
[time=2182] And through that trial and because of that crisis, because of that loss, because of that heartbreak we might for the first time be able to see just how desperately we need the person of Christ.
[time=2195] See just how sinful we really are.
[time=2202] After about sixteen years of ministry, I've become convinced that people, a lot of people,
[time=2208] there's a high percentage of people who will not see or hear the voice of God unless they
[time=2214] are in the midst of some major crisis in their life.
[time=2219] I've never seen it more clearly than when I've had privilege to minister to athletes, some college athletes, some professional athletes.
[time=2226] And they really provide a window of understanding on this one for us.
[time=2230] I have found that when they are doing well, when they are getting the new contract, when they are signing the new scholarship, when their numbers are breaking the records, they really have very little interest in the things of God at all.
[time=2245] I think that's our monitors.
[time=2247] They are very disinterested in the things of God.
[time=2252] But all you have to do is wait around a little while and when those statistics go south
[time=2259] and they're on the injured list and they wonder how long they're going to get to stay with this program, all of a sudden they're very interested in the things of God.
[time=2270] And they're able to perceive their own sense of sinfulness and they're able to hear a little more clearly their conscience and the voice of God calling them.
[time=2280] I want to say to you this morning that if you are in the midst of a trial, in the midst of some enormous crisis, if you are finding yourself with a lump in your throat
[time=2289] this morning because you know you're on the verge of losing somebody either to an illness or rebellion or death or divorce, God is calling to you through the midst of that crisis.
[time=2302] That is a wake-up call.
[time=2307] Some of you here this morning have been knocked off the foundations of your carefully planned life and you're feeling hopeless and you're feeling helpless to change it.
[time=2319] God's calling. God's calling.
[time=2324] God's voice, listen for it, He's saying this, I care about you and I can help you.
[time=2331] And if you're done living in these parts and you want to get whole,
[time=2338] we can make this the most important Easter of your life as you embrace me, as your Savior.
[time=2348] Another of the wake-up calls the Bible talks about is what I'll call the strategically placed Christian.
[time=2355] The strategically placed Christian. In Acts 8 there's an Ethiopian leader who doesn't understand a lot about God.
[time=2363] He's curious, He's wondering, but there's just a whole host of questions that are between him and really embracing the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2371] He's traveling along in his form of transportation in that particular day, a chariot.
[time=2376] And God sends a strategically placed Christian, a trustworthy, knowledgeable Christ follower,
[time=2385] and He intersects the Ethiopian's life right at the time when the Ethiopian was trying to understand a verse from scripture.
[time=2392] And it was a verse predicting the coming of Christ to die and be the Lamb of God.
[time=2399] And they just went connect.
[time=2402] And that Ethiopian leader allowed himself and had the courage to say to Philip,
[time=2408] "Philip explained this to me, I don't get it." And Philip took the time and explained to him the truth about God and about salvation and about Christ.
[time=2420] I'm asking you this morning, is God giving you a wake-up call in the form of a trustworthy Christ follower
[time=2430] that He has placed in your life?
[time=2435] Is there a loving, knowledgeable, trustworthy Christ follower anywhere in the vicinity of your life right now?
[time=2444] If there is, it seems clear from scripture, this could be a wake-up call from God.
[time=2450] He's invading your these parts.
[time=2453] He's trying to assist you overcome the spiritual blindness and the spiritual deafness and the lack of feeling for the things of God that are hampering you to embrace the cross.
[time=2468] I can't tell you how often God uses people as wake-up calls in other people's lives.
[time=2475] Then I would give you this one small piece of advice this morning on this particular issue.
[time=2481] Seek that Christian out at your own time, at your own pace and in your own way,
[time=2488] but seek him out and let him answer some of the fuzzy things in your mind about Christianity.
[time=2494] Most of us have gone through this in the realm of the computer world.
[time=2498] It's out there. We know it's out there. It has humongous benefits for us.
[time=2502] The PC is here and we've been interested and we've wanted to know and we've wanted to get online,
[time=2510] but there were just a lot of questions that we didn't understand.
[time=2514] And what have most of us done?
[time=2517] We found somebody who's a little further down that path than we are and said would you explain this to me and would you explain this to me and would you show me how this works and would you demonstrate this for me?
[time=2528] And slowly but surely we get into that realm and now many of us are happily functioning in a world that before seemed vague and distanced and had too many obstacles to penetrate.
[time=2538] It's the same thing with Christianity.
[time=2540] You can see it out there. You can recognize the benefits.
[time=2546] You want to become a child of God and give your life to Christ, but there are some obstacles that are standing in your way.
[time=2553] And what I'm saying is there's a good chance God has strategically placed a trustworthy, faithful, loving Christ follower somewhere in your life.
[time=2562] Maybe it's work. Maybe it's your neighborhood. Maybe it's in your family.
[time=2567] Maybe it's in your recreation. You know what that is? That's God calling you.
[time=2572] And saying ask your questions and get not just the intellectual ones resolved, but get close enough to this Christian to see the difference that's happened in his life or her life.
[time=2582] The third wake up call that I find God issuing in the scriptures is this one.
[time=2590] It's just called massive, massive doses of kindness.
[time=2596] God issues wake up calls in people's lives who are not interested in him at that moment through massive doses of kindness.
[time=2605] It says in Romans 2, 4, the kindness of God leads you to repentance.
[time=2610] It's the kindness of God that leads you to repentance.
[time=2614] He has a way sometimes of just wearing people down with his goodness and his grace
[time=2620] and his kindness in their life.
[time=2622] He just floods their lives with so many good things that eventually they got to back up and say somebody has got to be orchestrating all the good things that are happening to me.
[time=2632] This can't be just chance. This can't just be that I'm lucky.
[time=2636] This can't just be that I deserve it because I know me too well.
[time=2639] Who is it and why?
[time=2643] These people will listen to the radio and they'll hear the calamity that strikes in so many people's lives.
[time=2649] They'll see the stuff on television and see the calamity that drives its way into most people's lives,
[time=2655] they look at their own life and they say I have a wife and I have kids who love me and a job and a house and I love where I live and I'm challenged in my...
[time=2663] Who's...why me?
[time=2666] Why me?
[time=2668] That's a wake-up call, my friend.
[time=2671] God is pursuing you through massive doses of kindness.
[time=2676] He's trying to break you out of these parts by invading you and your life with more kindness than you know you deserve.
[time=2684] I was speaking with a young man not too long ago, I was flying on a little puddle jumper from one place to the other
[time=2693] and we got into conversation and he began to tell me this incredible story.
[time=2697] He said I have no reason to be alive right now. I should be dead.
[time=2701] I said why? He said well because I was driving a motorcycle and it wasn't even my fault but this car cut me off
[time=2707] and the intersection and my motorcycle ran right into them broadside and I literally catapulted through the intersection
[time=2713] and landed in the cement or on the cement.
[time=2717] Went into a coma, had a number of different broken bones etc etc but at that moment no more than a year after the accident
[time=2724] he said I have full capacity in every bone of my body and my mind works as well as it ever has
[time=2730] and then he looked at me and he says I don't know why I'm not dead.
[time=2737] I should be dead. Maybe you have some experiences like that in your life.
[time=2743] And what I said to him I want to say to you my friend that has a wake up call coming straight out of heaven.
[time=2749] God is trying to help you overcome some of the barriers between you and the person of Jesus Christ
[time=2755] and he's doing it in your particular case with massive doses of kindness.
[time=2763] And he's saying please understand I love you and I am pursuing you.
[time=2772] Well let me wrap it up this way.
[time=2775] Easter the resurrection is all about Christ taking off the patch and letting you see your need for a Savior.
[time=2785] Easter is all about removing the pad and letting you hear very clearly the voice of God beckoning you.
[time=2793] I love you and I care about you.
[time=2797] And Easter is all about a sling and the removal of that by the person of Christ so that you can reach out
[time=2803] with both arms and begin to love the way you long to love and be loved the way you long to love.
[time=2812] And I don't know if you have the faith to believe this yet or not this morning.
[time=2817] But I need to stand here and tell you that there is a God and you matter to him very very much.
[time=2825] Very very much he sends not only his son but then he sends these personal wake up calls into your life.
[time=2837] You say how do I respond to him? I mean okay I'm getting the message and I'm hearing it and I want to respond how do I embrace Christ.
[time=2848] I'll give you a little memory key here it's very easy think about the patch the pad and the sling.
[time=2853] With the patch admit that you can see your sinful that you have a desperately sick heart and it's wicked and you need to be forgiven for what you've done.
[time=2862] Think of the patch and say but I can hear the voice of God and he does love me and he has provided for me and he is pursuing me.
[time=2872] And then think about the sling and realize that Jesus Christ with both arms spread them and was crucified to pay the price for that sin so that you could be born again.
[time=2882] It's a simple matter of admitting seeing yourself for who you are responding the loving voice of God and saying that it all happens and can be resolved because of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[time=2898] You know when Jesus was still on the earth after he was crucified on good Friday and then he rose again on Sunday Easter the first Easter.
[time=2907] There was a period of time after he was risen from the dead before he ascended to go back up into heaven and during this period of time he was showing himself to a great number of people because he wanted to make sure that today we had no question about the historicity of that event.
[time=2921] Thousands of people saw the resurrected Jesus Christ and there were two in particular that I want to just bring to your mind as we close today.
[time=2930] Two guys that were called disciples they had followed Christ around but you know what the patch the pad the sling they never really got the message they were just impaired and they never got through some of those barriers.
[time=2942] But after he rose from the dead these two disciples were walking by foot just out of Jerusalem to a city about seven miles away and they happened into a stranger.
[time=2953] And the stranger made his way into their company and he said what are you guys talking about and they said haven't you heard don't you know that the great Jesus Christ was crucified?
[time=2967] And Jesus said oh was he?
[time=2971] And then this stranger began to talk all about the Old Testament and how this Jesus had to be crucified so that he could be raised from the dead.
[time=2980] And they had this big long discussion and it was beginning to make sense to these two disciples and finally they reached their destination sat down for a meal and they looked up from their dinner table and they finally dawned on them who the stranger was.
[time=2993] It had been the person of Jesus Christ the whole time in his resurrected form and for some reason they had been unable to recognize him for who he was.
[time=3002] And recognizing him for who he was they worshiped him they committed their life to him.
[time=3010] In a minute in a very private way I'm going to give you an opportunity to accept Christ as your personal word and Savior to embrace him as your own.
[time=3022] Someone has written a song about that event Jesus happening upon the path of these two disciples and they go from a place where they can't see who Christ is.
[time=3035] They don't understand that they're actually hearing the voice of God when he talks to him and they feel nothing for him.
[time=3041] And by the end of that conversation at that meal they suddenly can see and they can hear and they can feel and they're alive.
[time=3051] Then I've asked Susan if she'd come and sing this song to us.
[time=3056] And as she's singing their experience I want you to ask yourself this question, is this the experience that you want with Christ?
[time=3064] Is this the difference that you want to have in your life because of Easter and the person of Christ?
[time=3069] And I'll come back when she's done then close our service and order prayer.
[time=3079] He walked beside me like he'd been there all along, not a stranger, but a father who concerns when something's wrong.
[time=3101] Then he answered on my questions and he understood my fears that somehow vanished now, that he was near.
[time=3120] Can't you see who walks with you? Can't you hear the spectrum? Can't you feel something strange in your heart?
[time=3141] How his words rain strong and true like a once familiar strain?
[time=3153] Could the paths we follow for unknown be the same?
[time=3184] I couldn't bear for him to leave, so I begged him to stay, spend the evening, a few moments before he went his way.
[time=3207] Then like a host, he stood in the last room, broke the bread and poured the wine.
[time=3218] Then there was something I knew I recognized.
[time=3227] Yes, I can see who walks with me. I can hear who speaks my name.
[time=3239] I can feel something strange in my heart.
[time=3249] How his words rain strong and true like a once familiar strain?
[time=3261] And I know I'll never be the same. I can see.
[time=3275] In from that small mansion side, I feel the emptiness of sight.
[time=3287] In all the glory of his power shining through.
[time=3296] In for the first time in my life, I will not into his eyes.
[time=3308] And so eternity and suddenly I knew that I could see.
[time=3326] I can see who walks with me. I can hear who speaks my name.
[time=3336] I can feel something stirring in my heart.
[time=3347] How his words, his words rain strong and true like a once familiar strain?
[time=3359] And I know I'll never be the same.
[time=3369] I can see. I can see.
[time=3391] I can see.
[time=3411] Well, as I said, I want to give you an opportunity to pray to receive Jesus Christ as your personal
[time=3419] Lord and Savior and really embrace the cross and the meaning of what Easter is all about.
[time=3424] And you can do that right now. As I pray out loud, if you say in your heart to God what you're hearing me say,
[time=3430] and if you mean it, God will hear you and he'll answer your prayer.
[time=3434] So let me invite you at this time to bow your head with me.
[time=3437] And as I pray, follow along. Say it to God the Father. He'll hear you.
[time=3442] Heavenly Father, I know that I can see very clearly that I am a sinner, that the problem runs deep in my life, and I want forgiveness for that.
[time=3455] I can hear today loud and clear your love for me, and I can understand how Christ spread both arms
[time=3462] as He died on the cross for my sins.
[time=3465] And I accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior today.
[time=3468] I confess my sin to you, ask Him into my heart to be my Lord and Savior.
[time=3473] I thank you for forgiving me today, in Jesus' name, amen.
