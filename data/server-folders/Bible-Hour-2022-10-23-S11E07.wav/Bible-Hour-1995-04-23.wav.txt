[time=0] >From the very innermost being there must be a commitment to continue to seek the
[time=8] person of Jesus Christ. Not programs, not churches, not Bible studies, those may
[time=15] be tools in that search and seeking but the person of Christ is the one we must be after through all of it. And then he says the second most important thing you must do in verse 2 is set your mind on things above not on things that are on the earth.
[time=33] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=39] We're glad you've joined us. Coming to Christ means more than fire insurance against flames of hell. More than anything. Coming to Christ means a dramatic change in the way we handle relationships. It changes our relationship with God and with the people in our lives. Stay with us today as we discover just how great the change can be.
[time=63] I believe that anything is possible if you understand who Jesus is.
[time=81] Nothing here on earth can stop us if we could dream like Jesus did.
[time=92] Don't limit your ambitions to what's commonly defined. God has a special
[time=100] heart for those who walk outside the mind. He sees your plan. So come and take his
[time=110] hand. Don't be afraid.
[time=116] Dream big, it is the Lord's desire. Dream big in everything you do.
[time=130] And you'll see your greatest dreams come true cause all of it.
[time=138] Is dreaming big for you.
[time=147] I believe that we can make a difference if we fall down on our knees and pray.
[time=165] Long ago 12 men turned this world around and we can do the same today.
[time=176] So let your imagination run as far as you can see.
[time=183] Come dream along with God of everything that you can be.
[time=189] Don't be afraid to spread your wings and fly.
[time=195] It doesn't hurt to try.
[time=199] Dream big, it is the Lord's desire. Dream big in everything you do.
[time=214] And you'll see your greatest dreams come true cause all of heaven.
[time=222] Is dreaming big for you.
[time=229] Dream big, it is the Lord's desire. Dream big in everything you do.
[time=243] And you'll see your greatest dreams come true cause all of heaven.
[time=251] Is dreaming big for you. Dream big, it is the Lord's desire.
[time=261] Dream big in everything you do.
[time=267] And you'll see your greatest dreams come true cause all of heaven.
[time=275] Is dreaming big for you.
[time=287] That dream that you have to be successful, to be prosperous, that dream that you may have to be the difference in your communities.
[time=295] Listen, that dream is not yours alone, but it is God's dream along with you.
[time=302] And God in all of heaven is dreaming big with you. And today we'll stop by your church to say, don't be afraid.
[time=313] Come on. Dream big.
[time=320] [AMEN]
[time=328] We'll return to our service in just a moment. From mild irritation to uncontrolled rage, anger wears many faces and plays numerous roles in our life.
[time=337] Sometimes justified, often not, anger is one of our emotions that must be kept under the dominating control of the Holy Spirit.
[time=345] Like fire, it can either be of benefit or cause permanent damage.
[time=349] Something that powerful deserves our full attention and God's full control. This booklet is dedicated to helping victims of anger get a grip on the problem.
[time=359] And we'll give you the address on how you can get this booklet at the end of the program.
[time=364] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour today and thank you for joining us.
[time=369] Well, spring has at least technically been here for a while and I think now we're starting to see some of the signs and I know that I'm excited about that.
[time=377] Looking forward to a change in our weather, a change in the activity we get to be involved in and of course spring running into summer and all the fun that that brings to mind.
[time=386] And as I see that the seasons change, I am often called to examine my own life and look in my own heart and think through my relationship with God and the whole progression of life in general.
[time=400] And it causes me to want to ask you a couple of questions or to encourage you to think through some very important issues as you head towards the spring and towards the summer.
[time=408] The first category, I want to speak to you who are married and just realizing the wonder and the miracle of what God creates inside of marriage and how often it is that we can slip out of making that the priority that we ought to make it.
[time=425] How we can put it on the back burner, how we can take our spouse for granted, how we can find ourselves passionately pursuing other things and activities and hobbies and work and all those things.
[time=440] And yet that very special person that we said I do to so many years ago may be languishing in the absence of your love and your pursuit and your interest and the energy in your life.
[time=452] And I guess as we're sitting here looking at a new season and experiencing the fun that it represents and the change it is in our lives, I want to ask you what plans do you have for your spouse?
[time=462] What is in your mind? Are you going to go after your spouse and invest and develop that relationship and make that other person feel special?
[time=472] Or are they kind of all together left out of your thinking? Maybe you'll just plan on tolerating them or trying to keep them from getting in your way.
[time=481] Let me promise you something from God's Word. It's God's design and pattern that they be the center of your attention and the focus of your life.
[time=489] You want to have the best spring and summer you've ever had? Maybe not the most fun in some categories but best in terms of quality and you becoming a whole person and all that God designed you to be.
[time=501] Set them as a focus. Put them in a place of priority. Think creatively and invest deeply in that relationship. You'll never be sorry that you did.
[time=510] For those of you now who are single and you're listening to what I've just said and say it doesn't really matter to me.
[time=516] Well, that may be true in the context of marriage but I want to talk to you about your relationships as you think about spring and you think about the summer.
[time=524] Are you planning to build into those relationships godly characters of holiness and maturity and integrity and giving of yourself to invest in the close people around you?
[time=536] Or are your plans a little bit different? Are you considering immoral behavior inside those relationships?
[time=542] Are you considering selfishly kind of taking from that relationship what you can get out of it whether it be moral or immoral and instead of really looking to invest and who is that other person and how can I enhance them and how can I build them up?
[time=558] And then the last category I want to address with you today would be for those of us who are parents and I know that my five children are seemingly endless vessels into which I can pour myself.
[time=573] And I think it's the greatest investment I can make and I think when you stop and think about where you're going to give your time and who are you going to pour yourself into yourself or your children.
[time=584] There's no question in those sane and rational moments where you know your time ought to go.
[time=589] But it's very easy to be swept up in losing sight of them and making plans really independently of them and so I want to challenge you in that regard as well.
[time=600] Boy, what better way could you think of to face these new seasons and take the opportunities that they bring to you other than to invest in your kids make a deep profound lifelong commitment to pour into their lives just this spring and this summer.
[time=618] And again I promise you based on God's word there will be no greater investment in your life.
[time=622] You know it all comes down to relationships and honor God with your life.
[time=627] God bless you.
[time=630] Listen, although we live in a day and a time where it seems that there are no absolutes, the fact still remains that there is an answer for all of life's problems today and his name is Jesus.
[time=647] If you have some questions in the corners of your mind, traces of discouragement and peace you cannot find reflections of your past seem to face you every day.
[time=671] But this one thing I do know that Jesus is the way.
[time=680] Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=688] Above and there's no other Jesus is the way.
[time=697] Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=705] Above and there's no other Jesus is the way.
[time=714] Jesus says that I am the way, the truth and the life.
[time=717] And that no one else comes to the thought but by me.
[time=721] Aren't you glad this morning that Jesus has made a way for us all now?
[time=726] Listen to this.
[time=728] I know you've got mountains that you think you cannot climb.
[time=735] I know your skies are dark and you think your sun won't shine.
[time=743] In case you don't know but the word of God is true and everything he's promised he will do for you.
[time=761] Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=769] Above and there's no other Jesus is the way.
[time=778] Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=785] Above and there's no other Jesus is the way.
[time=796] Let's just take a moment now and close our eyes and meditate on the wonderful fact that Jesus is the truth that sets all mankind free.
[time=805] And today we're able to sit in this wonderful edifice and we're liberated by the truth to lift up holy hands and to praise and to worship our God today.
[time=814] Won't you worship the Lord with me and sing this with me?
[time=817] Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=822] For the world today above and there's no other.
[time=826] Above and there's no other Jesus is the way.
[time=830] Jesus is the way Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=838] For the world today above and there's no other.
[time=846] Jesus is the way one more time.
[time=850] Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=855] For the world today above and there's no other.
[time=863] Jesus is the way Jesus is the answer for the world today.
[time=875] Above and there's no other Jesus is the way.
[time=888] Now Father we prepare our hearts to receive from you your word.
[time=893] We know that you are the answer.
[time=895] And today right now we prepare our hearts to listen to what you have to say.
[time=901] To the answer you wait and give your thanks for the advance in Jesus' name.
[time=908] And Jesus is the answer.
[time=918] [AMEN] Thank you really.
[time=924] It's a joy to, by sitting there thinking about the diversity of God's creation and how thankful I am to worship with Willie who is so much like me and in some ways a little bit different.
[time=935] Come to Colossians chapter 3 which happens to be the passage and better and wonderful.
[time=941] Hey Colossians chapter 3 now we're in that chapter this morning but I was thinking about this while he was singing.
[time=947] Verse 11 there's a renewal in which there is no distinction between Greek and Jews circumcised and uncircumcised
[time=954] barbarian, the Scythian, the slave, the free man but Christ is all and in all.
[time=961] And that is the wonderful reality and when I see Willie worshiping God and having a heart for the same Savior
[time=967] and doing it so wonderfully and so well and slightly different man it causes me to see Christ even more clearly and I'm thankful for that.
[time=975] I want to give my word of thanks to all of you who are a part of making the promise keepers event happen yesterday.
[time=980] I know a number of us in our church are part of the task force and it just went wonderfully.
[time=985] Thank you for ministering that way a special word of thanks to Marv Eastland as one of our elders kind of leading that charge.
[time=991] We had over 70 men that we knew of who bought tickets in our sanctuary or in our foyer to be a part of that event.
[time=997] And when I got there I just kept running into us all over the place and those promise keepers shirts serving behind the scenes
[time=1003] and working and I just want you to know I'm proud of you and thankful for your involvement and your investment.
[time=1008] I know that lies were changed yesterday.
[time=1010] It was great to be there that one of the keynote speakers Emerson Dr. Emerson Eggerich who Heidi and I just kind of knew as Eddie.
[time=1017] He changed his name later.
[time=1019] He actually oversaw our wedding.
[time=1022] He was the pastor who married us.
[time=1025] It was just Eddie Eggerich back then now it's Dr. Emerson Eggerich.
[time=1028] And it was great.
[time=1030] I went up to him shook his hand.
[time=1031] I didn't remember who I was which also made me feel good because I can do that to other people.
[time=1035] And that was good news.
[time=1038] And you know Russell Moore how are you?
[time=1041] So it was a great time.
[time=1043] Great time of fellowship and our camera guys were there with their crew and all of our TV cameras doing the iMEG thing
[time=1049] and it was a great thing and I'm thankful our church could be a part of all that.
[time=1053] Colossians chapter three this morning I'm going to jump ahead one paragraph.
[time=1058] We would normally be studying verses five to eleven of chapter three this morning.
[time=1062] But I want to look at verses twelve thirteen and fourteen because I want to through God's word address some issues inside of our church.
[time=1071] Some stuff that's going on.
[time=1072] I received a letter this week from a person in our church who said what in the world is going on in our church.
[time=1078] And is God taking his hand of blessing off of us and are we going to be okay and what about this new church that's starting and all that stuff.
[time=1086] And if you haven't heard there is a new church that's going to be starting out in the northeast side of town.
[time=1091] Nobody's quite sure just where yet.
[time=1093] But five families from our church and former pastor from our church pastor Peter Kobe and his son-in-law pastor Scott quals.
[time=1101] They met some time ago a couple weeks ago or I don't know ten days by now ago and had a formal official decision to start a new church.
[time=1110] And that obviously is rumbled through our church and there's been a number of rumors that have come with that.
[time=1115] Some of those have been about me and my ministry and there's a lot of gossiping going on.
[time=1121] And that in the midst of our talking about a fundraiser and how can we launch that in light of the potential impact of yet another church that kind of comes out of our church and all that kind of stuff.
[time=1131] So I didn't feel it would be appropriate to stand up here and ignore all that but rather to seize the opportunity to address those issues not necessarily particularly but through this text.
[time=1142] And what I want to do is Paul lists seven virtues out of this text and I want to explain those very briefly to you.
[time=1150] And I believe that if we will hang on to the seven virtues listed in these few verses it will do us well.
[time=1156] We can come through this process and when all is said and done look back and say man we had the right kind of heart, we had the right kind of attitude, we honored God in the midst of adversity and difficulty.
[time=1167] And then at the, when I'm done with that I want to give two perspectives by way of application, two things that I think will really help us bring all that together and walk in a way that pleases God in the midst of these particular days.
[time=1180] Virtue number one, let's just read these verses, verse 12.
[time=1185] And so as those who have been chosen of God, holy and beloved put on a heart of compassion and kindness and humility and gentleness and patience bearing with one another and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone, just as the Lord forgave you so also should you.
[time=1205] As you know we've come out of chapter one in Colossians which was this marvelous lifting up of the person of Jesus Christ and the gospel and the wonder that people can be saved and forgiven through the person of Christ.
[time=1218] Chapter two Paul dealt with this normal tendency, though it is wrong, inside the church and those kind of naming the name of Christ to want more out of their Christian experience than they are getting through the word and through the person of Christ.
[time=1233] And so there has been through the ages a temptation to be susceptible to false prophets and false teachers who offer you something more than you're experiencing in Christianity as if Christianity isn't enough.
[time=1246] And the way you're living your life could be better and more meaningful and deeper and more spiritual and so the false teachers come along and they offer legalism and they offer mysticism and they offer human philosophy and they offer asceticism
[time=1259] and they hold in their offer this little promise that if you'll just move away from Christ or add to Christ their little teaching then you'll really be satisfied.
[time=1270] And we have found from the Apostle Paul that the issue is in no way shape or form resolved by moving outside above or beyond the person of Christ.
[time=1279] The issue is resolved by driving deeper in our understanding and our commitment and our love for and in his ability to control our life that is the life of Christ.
[time=1288] Christ is the beginning and the end of Christian existence and there is nothing outside of that and anytime we move beyond it we've messed up.
[time=1295] So you come in now to chapters three and four and you come to the practical side of this book.
[time=1300] Two chapters kind of of doctrine and now the practical implications of doctrine and you remember last time we studied this two weeks ago Paul says verse one the beginning point of all the practical outworkings of your Christian life are in seeking the things that are above
[time=1317] where Christ is. There's a fundamental turning of the heart and the soul and the mind to pursue the person of Jesus Christ above all else.
[time=1326] And all these other directives that he's going to give us in chapters three and four will be of no avail and will make a little difference in our life if first and foremost the passionate pursuit of life isn't the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1338] And then he gave us another real important principle in verse two when he said the way you do that is you set your mind on things above.
[time=1346] You and I are responsible to not only set our heart and our emotions and our passion and our very being on the person of Christ but then to guard that decision and bolster that decision by thinking about things which honor that decision, the things which are above not on the things which are on the earth.
[time=1363] And we understand from our counsel from other places in the Word of God that where your mind goes there goes the rest of your life.
[time=1370] And so he really gives us the two starting points of a godly life seek the person of Christ with all your being and control your mind to the same.
[time=1379] And watch over time it will work out in a marvelous way as you grow in the grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=1387] Beginning in verse five through verse 17 he picks up a metaphor of setting the old man or the old self off look at verse nine.
[time=1398] Do not lie to one another since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices and next week we'll look at those.
[time=1404] Up in verse five they are immorality, impurity, passion, evil, desire, greed, idolatry. In verse eight more of the old self anger and wrath and malice and slander and abusive speech from the mouth.
[time=1416] At verse ten he says that's part of the analogy but there's another part called putting on the new self.
[time=1423] It's not enough just to let go of what you were before you were Christ there is this wonderful process of putting on now things of virtue.
[time=1431] And that's what we're about this morning at least part of the passage.
[time=1434] And so he says in verse twelve the heart of compassion kindness put those things on and you will begin to experience the fullness of what Christ and God have intended for us in our Christian walk.
[time=1447] We don't experience that stuff by running away from Christ or adding to Christ we just go after him more completely and more fully putting off the old putting on the new.
[time=1456] Okay, so that's kind of where we are in this book.
[time=1460] But as I said seven virtues are given to us in verses twelve and thirteen and I kind of want to just rapid fire hold them up to you.
[time=1467] I think you'll see the immediate relevance to our situation.
[time=1471] The first one in verse twelve put on a heart of compassion, a heart of compassion.
[time=1478] And what this is about these are the, this is a command that's talking about the bowels of compassion.
[time=1485] This is the place where people feel certain things.
[time=1488] And it is true that as believers you and I are bound up in a commitment to what they call or what the Bible calls agape love.
[time=1496] Which isn't a feeling necessarily.
[time=1498] It is first and foremost a commitment to do something.
[time=1502] To act sacrificially on another person's part for God's to love the world that he agape does.
[time=1508] He gave his only begotten son.
[time=1511] Love is first a verb it is an action and whether you feel like it or not we are never as believers excused from acting in a loving way towards the people in our lives, right?
[time=1522] But here he is saying that by the way also is not enough.
[time=1528] As you experience the newness in Christ there is a heart of compassion that comes underneath and girds that commitment to agape love.
[time=1538] And there is something deep within you that extends itself to another brother or sister inside the body of Christ.
[time=1546] In 2 Corinthians 7, 15 it says Paul is speaking about Titus addressing the Corinthians.
[time=1559] As he remembers your obedience and he remembers the way you received him.
[time=1563] Titus ministered in many different places to many different people was a part of many different churches.
[time=1568] But as he came to Corinth he exhibited this heart of compassion.
[time=1572] There was no favoritism in his mind.
[time=1575] He opened the very bowels of who he was to extend himself to these particular people.
[time=1580] That is a virtue in Christianity.
[time=1583] In Philippians 1-8 Paul raises the standard.
[time=1586] He says this, "For God is my witness.
[time=1589] How I long for you with all the affection of Christ, my lands."
[time=1595] Paul is saying this, "I don't just love you out of my perspective about you and out of the context of my relationship with you.
[time=1604] I long for you out of my understanding of Christ's affection for you.
[time=1610] My effort is to see you like Christ sees you and love you like Christ's love you.
[time=1616] And he sees you in this marvelous, wonderful way as his child.
[time=1620] He's involved in your life. He's totally committed to you. He died for you. He intercedes for you.
[time=1625] He's never backing up from you. That's how I love you.
[time=1628] That's what the heart of compassion does for me as I look at you.
[time=1633] It's a wonderful principle, isn't it?
[time=1636] We are not just called to act nicely towards our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=1640] We are called to open and continue to open the heart and the bowel of compassion to the extent that Jesus did in their behalf.
[time=1648] Virtue number two, the word kindness.
[time=1651] You can see it in verse 12.
[time=1653] Put on, then he would say, "A heart of kindness." And kindness, as one man said, is the virtue of a man whose neighbor's good is as dear to him as his own.
[time=1664] The neighbor's good is as dear to him as his own.
[time=1669] It is the friendly and helpful spirit which seeks to meet the needs of others through kind deeds.
[time=1675] If a heart of compassion is the willingness to help, kindness is the helping.
[time=1680] Kindness is where we put flesh and bones around the intent and do things that are helpful and sacrificial and loving in other people's lives.
[time=1689] And again, you remember from last week in Romans 2, it is the kindness of God that leads us to repentance.
[time=1696] The kindness of God, they're speaking as we were last week to unbelievers saying God will overwhelm you with massive doses of kindness until you finally wake up and recognize that he's the author of it all.
[time=1709] And that is exactly what this term is talking about.
[time=1713] Where we, like God, would continue to extend kindness after kindness and deed after deed after deed to one another within our own assembly and with those even outside of our assembly.
[time=1725] The third virtue is this concept of humility.
[time=1728] He says then, "Put on, not just a heart of compassion, not just kindness, but humility."
[time=1734] It's intriguing, there is no word in the classical Greek language for this word humility.
[time=1739] They didn't value it as a virtue, they didn't want to talk about it, they didn't want to recognize it, and they didn't want to be it.
[time=1745] They didn't want to be humble.
[time=1747] Pride and arrogance and autonomy and independence and a supposed self-sufficiency was the virtue in this category for them, the very opposite of humility.
[time=1758] And it wasn't until the biblical writers came along that this word came into existence to where it could convey the notion, and here's what humility is.
[time=1766] It is recognizing our own shortcomings, failures, and weaknesses.
[time=1771] Not just giving lip service to them, but really coming to grips with our own weaknesses and our own failures and our own shortcomings and sin.
[time=1782] But the biblical concept of humility has it balanced, has that impression balanced by the power of God to work through those weaknesses.
[time=1792] It is biblical humility that not only sees how weak and how frail and how sinful a person is, I am, you are.
[time=1799] But we couple that with the commitment of God to work through our weaknesses for his glory and for his honor, which keeps us in the awareness of how sinful we are,
[time=1808] and how weak and how much less we are than we'd like to be, that keeps us from huddling up in a corner somewhere and having a pity party over ourselves.
[time=1817] It is the power and the wonder of the fact that God comes into our life and powers us to the Spirit of God and works through those weaknesses for his glory and for his honor.
[time=1827] Number four is the virtue of gentleness, gentleness. Now a lot of us when we hear that word in our day and culture are going to think about a milk toast,
[time=1838] milli mouth, spineless person who is so meek and so timid and so gentle that they can't even hardly communicate what they would like.
[time=1846] And they spend their whole life just bouncing around the fringes of humanity trying not to offend anybody.
[time=1851] And that is a completely wrong understanding of what gentleness or meekness is all about.
[time=1856] Biblical gentleness has a strength to it that far exceeds even the kind of macho image of strength.
[time=1866] Biblical gentleness is this. It is a willingness to suffer injury rather than to inflict it.
[time=1872] A willingness to suffer injury rather than inflict it on someone else.
[time=1877] In other words, true gentleness is this. If somebody is going to get hurt, let it be me.
[time=1883] If somebody is going to have to suffer, let it be me.
[time=1892] If somebody's got to lose, let it be me.
[time=1895] And it implies there that there is an ability to have it a different way.
[time=1900] The individual who is gentle doesn't have to succumb to that.
[time=1905] There is a willingness to succumb to that for the glory and the honor of God.
[time=1909] Personal rights are set aside, and what becomes the issue is what will advance the kingdom of God.
[time=1914] And if it means me being gentle and taking the hit, so be it.
[time=1919] There it is, true gentleness.
[time=1923] Number five, I kind of told you these would come in a hurry.
[time=1927] Number five is long suffering or patience.
[time=1930] It's at the end of verse 12, humility, gentleness, and patience.
[time=1935] This is the attitude that never loses patience with anybody over anything.
[time=1942] There is, no matter how badly they've been treated, no matter how angry, what might be a normal justification response to a particular situation, patience just keeps extending itself to the person.
[time=1956] And if, in this list, here would be one of my greatest weaknesses.
[time=1962] I struggle with being patient. I mean, just last night we were coming home, Heidi Knight from a dinner with some of our elders and some friends who are visiting in town, and we're standing, we've come through the garage and in the breezeway, and we're waiting for my second eldest daughter, Nikki, to open the door.
[time=1976] And it's appropriately locked because it's about ten o'clock at night.
[time=1979] Nikki comes to the door, she's got the keys.
[time=1981] Well, there's two keys on this key chain, and Nikki gets the wrong key in the wrong lock because there's two locks on the door.
[time=1986] And then she works with the wrong key in the right lock.
[time=1989] And then she gets the right key in the wrong lock.
[time=1991] And then she finally gets the right key in the right lock and open the door.
[time=1995] That's what I'm thinking.
[time=1997] I mean, what did that take?
[time=2000] Forty-five seconds? I mean, I can just feel this thing.
[time=2003] Patience is the virtue that when people are doing that, that is an innate illustration of the kinds of things we would need to go through as we walk through our life in a godly way where people may do things that deeply hurt us, that make us feel deeply betrayed, that may lead us into very difficult waters.
[time=2020] Patience, no problem, no problem.
[time=2023] It is the opposite of resentment and revenge, if that helps.
[time=2027] Patience is the opposite of resentment and revenge.
[time=2030] And the point is, if you're a patient person, you never get to the place of resentment and revenge because you don't allow the mistreatment to cause that kind of issue in your life because you are a long-suffering person.
[time=2042] The great illustration of this is in 1 Timothy 1.
[time=2045] When Paul is calling himself here, the chief of sinners, and he says, "It's amazing, the patience of God." He says, "As yet for this reason, I found mercy in order that in me as the foremost," and that's a reference to his notion of being the foremost of sinners.
[time=2063] Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him
[time=2069] for eternal life.
[time=2071] He's saying, "Man, if the Lord never lost His patience with me and all my Pharisaic attitudes and my self-righteousness and my persecution of the church, I mean, if through all of that He never lost patience with me, He'll never lose patience with anyone."
[time=2087] The long-suffering patience of God.
[time=2090] And that is the virtue that Paul calls on us to have in the midst of difficult circumstances.
[time=2095] You just never allow the resentment to build or the desire for revenge.
[time=2099] There's just an extending of long-suffering patience.
[time=2103] Number six is in found in verse 13.
[time=2105] Bearing with one another, bearing with one another.
[time=2109] And that means, as it says, to bear with someone or something, and one of the biblical dictionaries I looked into said this.
[time=2117] The bearing spirit or the forbearing spirit is able to move through persecution,
[time=2123] injury, insult, complaints, lies, and defamation of character.
[time=2129] That's exactly what it says.
[time=2131] The one who was able to bear with another, though there may be persecution, injury, insult, complaints, lies, and defamation of character, that is all covered underneath the grace of God.
[time=2142] That is all covered underneath the grace of God as it extends itself from one believer to another.
[time=2149] Able to say this, the Lord knows what He is doing, the Lord has a plan, the Lord has a purpose in all of this, and it is to manifest His glory.
[time=2157] And as long as we stay long-suffering and bearing with one another, God will be in a perfect position to honor Himself and glorify Himself through that.
[time=2166] It's when the saints stop being this, when we lose our heart of compassion, when we lose our kindness and humility and gentleness and patience, and we stop bearing with one another that God's glory is in that way robbed.
[time=2183] Number seven, and this I think is the last in the line for a very good reason.
[time=2189] He says in verse 13, bearing with one another and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone just as the Lord forgave you.
[time=2198] So you should forgive others.
[time=2201] In other words, it's this way.
[time=2203] You work at having a gentleness of heart.
[time=2206] We work at being patient.
[time=2207] We work at bearing with one another and having humility and gentleness.
[time=2211] But as the difficulties and the offenses of life add up, if there isn't a releasing of that stuff, if there isn't a true, genuine forgiveness of what occurs, then it just continues to fester inside and eventually you'll violate the commitment to gentleness and humility and patience and kindness.
[time=2230] There's got to be an exit door on this stuff and it gets sent out of the person's life where true forgiveness just extends a pardon for that and it's gone and it's out and the heart is cleansed and it can continue time and time again to live these seven virtues over and over and over again.
[time=2248] Where forgiveness isn't granted, it festers and it becomes
[time=2254] contaminating the heart.
[time=2259] So Paul says to the individual at Corinth, Paul says to the community at Corinth,
[time=2267] "This kind of reality must mark your church." What's so interesting in this notion of forgiveness is there's a reflective pronoun in there which means that we're supposed to be able to forgive ourselves and that doesn't mean that Russell forgives Russell and Bob forgives Bob.
[time=2283] It means that we are as a community of believers able to forgive the community of believers. He is saying what is incumbent on a strong healthy, vibrant bunch of believers is that they learn the ability to forgive another even within the company of the redeemed. It's not just for giving people outside the church, the pagans, the heretics, and those who are persecuting the church from the outside. Why should we forgive each other that way?
[time=2307] Well look what it says. In verse 13 it says, "Just as the Lord forgave you." Do you remember the parable in Matthew 18? The question is how many times should I forgive?
[time=2319] Seven times seven which means as many times as is required and then the story is told of a certain person working for a very rich man and the person stole more than he could ever repay. It was a debt he could never ever possibly repay in all of his life if he worked every day of his life and gave everything he earned back to the man he stole from. Never be able to pay it off but that the owner of all those goods forgave the person.
[time=2343] And then the person went out and found another person who owed him a very small amount of money and refused to forgive.
[time=2351] And the idea is how could you possibly refuse to forgive someone such a small infraction when you have been forgiven the enormity of a debt you could never pay by a holy and a righteous God.
[time=2363] So it is an endless flow of forgiveness and it is as deep as the forgiveness which we have received from Christ. Now as if to say in case you can't remember all seven virtues on the spur of the moment he gives us verse 14. And he says there look at that.
[time=2379] He says beyond all these things put on love which is the perfect bond of unity.
[time=2395] Love is the pinnacle of Christian experience. Love as we have said as the Bible defines it both an action of self-sacrificial love out of a heart of compassion that is motivated to forgiveness by the forgiveness of Christ. And my point to you is this as we walk through these next several weeks and months making our way still through final I hope stages of transition as a church. If you can't remember those seven virtues just in every encounter with people ask yourself the question what does it mean for me to love God and love this person in this situation. What is the loving thing to say? What is the loving thing to do?
[time=2435] And you'll find as you faithfully apply that principle you will be fulfilling the law of God.
[time=2439] And these seven virtues and others in Scripture not listed here will work their way into your life.
[time=2447] Seven virtues.
[time=2451] Let me give you two principles by way of application as we close.
[time=2455] The first is this.
[time=2459] Christ is the head of the church.
[time=2463] Christ is the head of the church. And Christ is the Lord of the church. And Christ has said I will build my church. And I believe that Christ is as busy building his church right now at Blackhawk Baptist Church as he has ever been. And as he will ever be because Christ is faithful to that calling in his life. As you remember when we started out on this a couple of years ago our goal was to revitalize our church a church of 25 years. And many of us know that we had gotten to the place where we were in some cases as they say sitting and soaking. And we had developed certain dimensions of relationships and if you weren't in these certain webs of relationships you never got into our relationships because they were so long settled over time and they were so deep and they were so meaningful.
[time=2519] And what God is in the process of doing at least one thing that I can immediately see is he's taking a whole bunch of us and putting us to minister on the south side of town. There may be a number of us that will now move to another point of northeast.
[time=2531] And what I am hearing through the grapevine and through firsthand accounts in the good sense is how people are starting to reach out to other people that they otherwise wouldn't have touched. They otherwise wouldn't have been involved in.
[time=2543] They're taking positions of service that they wouldn't have otherwise taken.
[time=2547] We have positions that are open for you to serve in this church because some of left that wouldn't be open right now. You say well that's not the way we want to go to revitalize this. Well I'd agree with that. I mean that wasn't in my mind but who's the Lord of the church and who's the head of the church and who's the one that makes finally some of these decisions, all of them ultimately, none other than the person of Jesus Christ. And so we don't have to lose hard in that.
[time=2571] The Lord knows how the Lord will prosper His church.
[time=2575] The thing we oftentimes forget, you read the book of 1 Corinthians.
[time=2579] You read the book of Ephesians or Colossians.
[time=2583] And what we sometimes think in our minds eye is that that church at Ephesus was one big church and they all met under the same pastor and the same elders and the same deacons in the same location all the time. So you get the letter to the saints at Ephesus and that's one big church.
[time=2599] Or you hear the letter to the Corinthians and the same thing there. One big church at the city of Corinth, they all met in the same room with the same. And that's not how it happened at all.
[time=2607] Inside of Corinth and inside Ephesus there were multiple congregations. And so when Paul would write to the church or to the saints at Ephesus, he was instructing and encouraging that entire multiplicity and diversity of groups of churches in that particular city. That's how he sees his church.
[time=2627] That's how he sees his ministry. He needs different forms and expressions of ministry to touch any given city and so he creates them. That's not divided in God's mind. That's not a problem in God's mind.
[time=2639] That's not a problem in the Lord's mind. He can work through all that stuff.
[time=2643] And I've heard some people say, yeah, but so much of this stuff has been there's a black cloud over it because of some of the way that it happened and shouldn't if we were going to plant a church, I mean shouldn't that have come from people within our church talking to leadership in our church and all of us together saying, yes, let's plant a church or let's plant a church. And how can God bless some of those kinds of things? Well, let me tell you some. God has been in the business of blessing efforts that didn't start right since the beginning because no human effort has ever been right from the beginning. You know what I'm saying? If we were limited to the only the perfect scenarios that God would bless and he wouldn't bless any of them, not even our church, any church because no church is perfect.
[time=2683] I was reminded this week of the words that Joseph said. You remember that situation with his brothers where they wanted to kill him and they were jealous and they were envious and they wanted to throw him into that pit which they did and they wanted to kill him there but they thought it better to sell him. And he goes through his whole life and there were a lot of very dark experiences in Joseph's life and he comes to the end of the whole thing and says this, as for you, he's speaking to his brothers, you meant evil against me. But God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result to preserve many people alive.
[time=2717] I'll tell you what folks, God is in the business of taking marred and humanly flawed and sinful situations and being able when it is all said and done to have his perfect result for the benefit of his children. And no less than that will I believe is going on here and he is no less capable to do it now than he was then.
[time=2739] So even though the way things might have happened are somewhat curious and you can have various interpretations of how they happen, listen, that's all underneath his power and he's able to add it all up for good.
[time=2751] Romans 828. We have nothing to fear. We have nothing to fear on that.
[time=2755] Let me talk about the gossiping for just a minute and the rumors that are going around. Remind yourself of this very important principle. You are not to be involved in gossip.
[time=2767] If you hear somebody saying something about a leader, me, a leader in our church, this church, that church that is not God honoring, stop that conversation. It's just that simple. Just stop the conversation and say I have no business listening to this. And then do the brotherly kind and loving things, say, and by the way unless you have dealt first hand with the person you're talking about, that issue should either be resolved because forgiveness has been sought and the issue was closed or you should be bringing me in as a second and third party in church discipline for Matthew 18 so we can get it resolved. But talking about all this stuff that is not God honoring has no place inside the body and I know that's hard. And I know I fall into wanting to hear and I need my help on this one too. I'm speaking to us here.
[time=2819] But as a church we have got to honor God by stopping the gossip and the rumors that go around. I have been amazed at some of the things that I have heard that I have done through this whole thing. And I want to say two things on this you guys. Number one, look I am not perfect. I mean I'm not even near that. I have people in my life who look at my life under a magnifying glass and who could tell you my sin and they are there on purpose because I want to be held accountable and I don't like the idea of a Christian leader off in some ivory tower or somewhere where he thinks he's invincible and doesn't have real sin in his life. I have real sin in my life.
[time=2859] I have real friends helping me with that and I am in the process of trying to grow and repent just like you are. That's the first thing I want to say. The second thing I want to say on that is as I had an opportunity this week to meet with a good friend who had been a part of a rumor about me. It was a tremendously refreshing opportunity to explain what the actual situation was. To have that person say man I apologize for what I have said to other people. Then the person said what can I do?
[time=2891] I said well it's going to be kind of tough. But one thing you can do is you can go back to at least the people you know you've said that to and rectify at least that part of the deal. And the person agreed to do that. But then in my mind I'm thinking this, there's a story I heard of a person who was a parishioner. I think it was over in England.
[time=2911] The parishioner comes to his pastor and says pastor, pastor I've done this horrible thing. I've told a rumor to some people. What can I do? And the pastor says well take your down pillow, rip it open. And take out each feather one at a time and place it on the door steps of everybody in our little village.
[time=2927] Then come back and see me. And the parishioner did that. And then he came back to the pastor and said okay I've done it. What do I do now?
[time=2935] And the pastor said okay now go back and pick all those up again.
[time=2939] Go back and get every one of those little feathers. And the parishioner looked at his pastor and said I can't do that. They're all blown away.
[time=2947] I don't know where they've gone. I can't go back and retrieve them. That is why gossip is so incredibly damaging. You can't even track it down if you want to.
[time=2959] So we got to really put a lid on that stuff.
[time=2963] I sought the counsel of the elders this week. What should I do with these rumors?
[time=2967] Should I stand up here and articulate them and then try to explain each and every one of them?
[time=2971] And the unanimous counsel was no. That is probably not the best thing.
[time=2975] All I can offer you is this. If you have heard something about me or you have heard something about the leadership of this church and it's bothering you and it's keeping you from being able to worship or being able to follow or being able to be a part, all I can do is ask you and extend to you.
[time=2991] You can call me. You can write me. And I will specifically address that issue with you. That's the best way that I know of to try to get some of the loose feathers that are flying around.
[time=2999] So I can do my best in that regard.
[time=3003] But I stand before you as a flawed human being, as a sinful human being who is doing his best to grow in the grace and the knowledge of Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=3011] And the only thing, the reason I say this, because I don't like standing up here talking about rumors is if to say there's nothing wrong with me. I certainly am not guilty of some of the things that I've heard I've done through this stuff, but at the same time it leads me with a very uneasy feeling that you would get the notion that I think that there's no issues in my life.
[time=3027] Enough said on that. Let me say one other thing.
[time=3031] The second principle of application here.
[time=3035] And it's this. Do you realize that when you read the scriptures that opposition and difficulties and setbacks don't mean necessarily that we're on the wrong path?
[time=3047] Often times it's when you're finding opposition and you're facing difficulties and setbacks that you are on the right path.
[time=3055] I mean Paul receives a Macedonian vision.
[time=3059] I mean there's no question in this situation as to whether or not he was supposed to go to Macedonia and minister the gospel.
[time=3067] He got a vision from God. He was on the right path. He was not in Macedonia more than a few weeks before he hit Philippi where he brought Lydia to the Lord and then this demon girl attached herself to him.
[time=3079] He graciously delivered her from the demon, but the owners of the slave girl found their prophet was gone without her being demon-possessed.
[time=3087] Put a coup against him through him in jail, beat him near close to the end of his life and left him in stocks in jail. That is the consistent report of scripture when you are faithfully following God's will for your life and your ministry you often run into this kind of stuff.
[time=3103] It's true to say you can bring some of it on yourself, but the mere fact that we as a church are facing opposition and difficulties is not necessarily an indication that we are headed in the wrong direction.
[time=3115] I want you to know that as I met with the elders this week we are as committed as ever to following God's leading for our church in these areas of evangelism and edification and equipping and exalting. This vision 2002, the basic components of that we believe still with all of our heart that is God's direction we are not backing up from that.
[time=3135] However, we do want you to know that it is time for us now to listen to you. Again, you remember we started the process with the survey?
[time=3145] We then say give us six months, let us show you an outreach service.
[time=3149] Let us show you a contemporary service. Why? Because if you don't experience one, then when you talk about a contemporary service you have an image of it in your mind it may be different than this person's and this person's in mind.
[time=3161] We've had five, six months. Now we can talk about how these actual things impact us as a church. What are the good and what are the strengths and what are the weaknesses. And as we told you, we do five or six months of this.
[time=3173] We would listen and then we would make some decisions because it's time for our church to make some decisions, declare who we're going to be, how we're going to ministry, when the outreach services will happen, what kind of worship services, contemporary traditional and how does the whole mix come together.
[time=3189] So I want you to know that we have purposed these next two weeks, starting next Sunday, the elders of our church will be in the commons down here during both morning services. And we invite you to break away from your ADF. We invite you to break away even from a service and go down there. It'll be a highly interactive time where each person gets to share. You'll probably be in a small group with an elder who really wants to hear now, based upon what we've done, tell us, help us. Help us. We need information.
[time=3221] Go to that. Be a part of that. We also are going to try to put together a much abbreviated and more specific survey that will hand out one Sunday, give you a week, and get it back the next Sunday. The elders will read through that gaining input. We want to make decisions in the direction that God has led us in a way that is sensitive to the people of our church.
[time=3241] That is our goal. That is our effort. We have, as they have, as an elder board, and we as a staff have covenanted to meet every Wednesday night, the last four Wednesday nights of May, and make those last three weeks of May decision time.
[time=3257] We want to ask you to pray, ask God to give our elders and staff wisdom.
[time=3261] Make final decisions the last three weeks of May, and then communicate with you the structure of our church the beginning of June.
[time=3269] Then make as many adjustments as we can in that direction.
[time=3273] Open our fundraiser most likely in the fall and be off and running. Do what God has called us to do.
[time=3281] Reach, lost people with the gospel, build Christians up, and glorify his name.
[time=3285] So I want to say a lot to you. I know it's a little technical, but I want you to know that that is where we are headed, and we are excited about that process, and we believe that God will lead us in and through that process for his glory and for his honor.
[time=3301] Please be assured, as I was talking with one wonderful lady
[time=3309] in our church, who's been here for 20, 25 years, aggressively evolved, both she and her husband, Godly people. This is what she said to me.
[time=3317] I want you to hear this. She said, listen, Russell, we love you, and we love you preaching, and we love the fact that you are trying to reach the lost.
[time=3325] We appreciate the fact that a church has to shift and change and grow as the culture around it moves so it can be relevant to that culture.
[time=3333] We support all that stuff. But you got to understand something. In the last six months, what's been going on in the morning services hasn't really ministered to us as a couple. We kind of feel like we're drying up because we're moving us to a more traditional style of worship. That is valuable.
[time=3349] That comes from a clean heart with a great attitude, seeing the bigger picture, but honestly saying this is where we connect with that. We're going to do our best as a staff and elder board to address those kinds of issues and come up with a structure that we can't meet everybody's needs, that's for sure, but where we can be aware of and responsive to some of these main components as we formalize our direction.
[time=3374] So please understand that we want to hear from you, and we want to respond to what you're saying, and we want to develop a system of ministry, a way of ministry that really meets your needs, as well as moves us in the direction we believe God has called us to go.
[time=3390] Well again, let me just continue to encourage you. I believe as we stand strong on those seven virtues, I believe as we remember that God is the Lord of the Church, Jesus Christ is committed to doing it, and He's doing it today as effectively as ever. And as you understand our intention for our future, the difficulty is not necessarily a sign that we've missed God's will, it may be the sign we're right smack dab in the middle of it, and we're looking now in these next couple of weeks to listen, then the following weeks makes decisions and stand together for the gospel.
[time=3422] Okay, let's stand for a closing order prayer.
[time=3426] Well if you would like to see God at work in your life to produce those kinds of
[time=3438] things, I have that overriding perspective that God is working in and through your life for His good and for His honor, regardless of the circumstances.
[time=3446] You can have that through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3450] If you'd like to invite Christ into your life at this time, I invite you to bow your head and pray along as I pray this prayer. Father, I know that I am a sinner, I know that my life certainly lacks those seven virtues.
[time=3462] I confess my sin to you, and I ask you to forgive me in the person of Jesus Christ to wash and cleanse me, and that through that relationship with Christ I can have the assurance that you'll work in and through the circumstances of my life for your good and for your glory, except Christ today as my personal Lord and Savior, and pray these things in Jesus name, amen.
[time=3482] Well if you just prayed except Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, we'd love to hear from you. Please write us here at the Bible hour.
