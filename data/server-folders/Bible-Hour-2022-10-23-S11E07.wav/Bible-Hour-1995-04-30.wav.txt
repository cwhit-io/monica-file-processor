[time=0] The devil made me do it.
[time=10] I couldn't help myself.
[time=11] The temptation was just too great.
[time=13] I don't know what came over me.
[time=16] You know, Christians are often surprised and confused by the sin in their lives.
[time=21] Having sincerely committed to live an obedient life to the glory of God, the continued plague of one's own personal sin can be very discouraging.
[time=29] Well, today Pastor Moore explains from our text in Colossians 3 how to recognize and
[time=35] recover from spiritual decline.
[time=38] Welcome.
[time=39] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=42] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=43] Now, let's join our service.
[time=59] Blessed Jesus come to me, sooth my soul with praise of peace, as I look to you alone.
[time=84] Fill me with your love.
[time=94] Bountains, high or valley's low, you will never let me go.
[time=109] By your fountain, let me drink, fill my thirsty soul.
[time=125] I'm glad you've joined us, my love's, praise that press to me.
[time=141] Worthy is the land who died for me.
[time=157] Blessed Jesus, come to me, as I fall down at your feet.
[time=178] Let me touch your nails, thine hands, Jesus I would see.
[time=194] Worthy is the land who died for me.
[time=240] Worthy us, more of us, praise that press to me.
[time=255] Worthy, worthy is the land who died for me.
[time=323] Hi, my name's Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour today and thank
[time=332] you for joining us.
[time=335] All with the bombing in Oklahoma City and then some of the deaths that have been occurring even in our own city, there just seems to be a random nature to the way that people
[time=346] are killing each other today in our country and I know that's different than in our even most recent past.
[time=352] It seems as though we're entering into a whole new kind of murder, a kind of senseless taking of life that is, as I've said, certainly foreign to the American way of life.
[time=363] And I am thankful, I guess, in the midst of all that, especially for a relationship with a God who is sovereign, who is aware of every detail of my life and of your life.
[time=376] And though our country now apparently has the kinds of people in it that will just kill without provocation, without relationship, without cause, not as if there was ever a good cause to murder someone, but no provoking issue.
[time=391] It is a tremendous comfort to know that God is a sovereign, loving God.
[time=396] It doesn't mean that he wouldn't allow us to be involved in that.
[time=399] What it means is that if we are ever caught up in that or if a loved one is caught up in that, we do have the confidence that he was aware of that and somehow he works that together for good in his plan.
[time=410] Well, we're going to be having a special outreach service coming up here, May 21st.
[time=416] That's a couple of weeks from today and I want to let you know that if you're an unbeliever or if you're an unchurched person and you've never been to church or maybe you've had a couple of experiences with church and it didn't really minister to you, didn't strike a court in your heart.
[time=429] The services that we'll be holding on May 21st, both at 9, 10 and 10, 50, will be designed for people just like you.
[time=436] People who feel an emptiness, have a concern about God and where he fits in life and you have a sense of a need to maybe understand more about him, you're looking at your life and it isn't all that you want it to be, but you're not sure at all that it's God and it's church and it's religion, but there may be something there for you.
[time=453] We would invite you to come and take a look at the way we're presenting that and maybe find an answer to some of those questions.
[time=479] [MUSIC - 251 seconds]
[time=754] Let me invite you to take your Bibles. Let's go to Colossians 3 as we continue our study of this text.
[time=765] Suppose that I was to tell you that everybody in this room, every single one of us this morning, could be grouped into one of two very simple categories.
[time=777] Regardless of the diversity of your life and all that's going on, all of us are going to fall into one of two different categories.
[time=785] Regardless of how long you've known Christ, some of you only maybe two months, others of you for 50 years.
[time=792] Regardless of how mature or immature you may be in your relationship with Christ at this very moment in time, every single one of us could be grouped into one of two categories.
[time=806] One category would be that of spiritual decline, spiritual decline, the other category that of spiritual growth or spiritual development.
[time=819] As I studied this text this week, it became clear to me that there is no middle ground. There is no holding pattern in your relationship with the Lord.
[time=826] You are either growing, maturing and developing, or you are shrinking and hardening and declining in your relationship with God.
[time=837] In a minute, I want to try to help you participate in somewhat of a self-diagnostic exercise to be able to figure that out if it isn't already immediately apparent to you.
[time=847] Before we do that little diagnostic exercise, let me ask two things of you right up front. Number one, that you'd be completely honest.
[time=855] Really, it's just you and the Lord, I'm not going to ask you to write anything down just in your own heart where you're sitting today, be brutally honest with this assessment.
[time=868] Secondly, I'll ask you to mentally get up out of your chair, not physically but mentally, and this side is spiritual decline. There's a big banner, you can see it, can't you?
[time=880] Over here, there's a big banner that says spiritual development, and I want you to envision that you've got a card with your name on it.
[time=889] And I want you to have the courage, at least mentally, this morning to get up out of your chair and go put your name on the appropriate side of the auditorium.
[time=899] Because if you do nothing else but just that this morning, you'll have given yourself a great foundation upon which the Lord can work in your life.
[time=910] Group one, spiritual decline. I'll give it to you in three phases. Spiritual decline kind of starts in the early stages.
[time=919] You're beginning to find yourself concerned with, excuse me, less concerned with pleasing God in the day to day.
[time=927] And you're starting to sense there's a desire to see yourself pleased, more than pleasing God.
[time=934] You might also be noticing that your servant's heart, though at once, was hot and there was a desire there kind of just moving out to serve other people that's beginning to cool now.
[time=946] You're not as interested in that anymore. It seems more like an intrusion than an opportunity.
[time=952] You can't quite put your finger on it exactly, but you're not as content with your life as you once were.
[time=963] You're not as content with the things you own. You're not as content with the people who surround you and how you're relating with them and they to you.
[time=971] And if you were to step back a little bit, you're not even sure you're content with kind of the general place you've come to in life, the accomplishments, the stuff that kind of makes you you.
[time=984] You find you're running a low grade anger in your life and you just can't shake it.
[time=991] And it's even starting to kind of flare up in some ugly ways that become noticeable by others.
[time=997] Those are what I call the early stages of spiritual decline.
[time=1002] We move next to the progressive stages of spiritual decline.
[time=1005] You find this desire to please yourself has grown into a clearly focused longing and desires for things which are sinful and don't honor God.
[time=1017] I mean the inner private world of your inner man, you find yourself discussing with yourself the pros and cons of engaging in activity which are clearly sinful out of bounds and unbiblical.
[time=1031] You're trying to figure out the pros and the cons, the wise and the why nots.
[time=1037] You're also noticing pockets of ill will in your heart for certain people.
[time=1043] You know that's true because you find yourself delighting in their setbacks and hardships and trials.
[time=1048] Kind of just for a moment but it's there and you also find yourself saddened, jealous, even resentful when you hear of their success or good news or good things happening in their life.
[time=1060] Well if that's progressive stages here it is to the advanced stage.
[time=1067] You're long past a lack of devotion to God coupled with a low grade anger.
[time=1071] You're long past the occasional longing to be involved in some type of sin.
[time=1075] You're actually doing it.
[time=1079] You're committing the sin you once were just thinking about.
[time=1082] For some of you it's still clandestine, it's secretive, it's occasional, but it's there.
[time=1089] Others of you are in outright open rebellion.
[time=1094] You're becoming very cavalier to the whole thing and you're just wantantly plunging in.
[time=1103] But you're hooked, you're compromised and you're in trouble.
[time=1110] Spiritual decline.
[time=1113] Just briefly, spiritual development because we touched on it last week and as you know we took this text a little bit of out of order.
[time=1121] You can see it again in verse 12.
[time=1124] I'll tell you how you know if you're in a process of spiritual development.
[time=1127] Number one, there's a heart of compassion inside of you.
[time=1129] You really feel other people's hurts.
[time=1132] Secondly, there's kindness.
[time=1134] Not only do you feel what their needs might be, you respond to those needs.
[time=1138] You have a sense of humility about you which you can't account of other than that you know how sinful you are and you're counting on God to kind of be powerful and make up and use you despite all that.
[time=1150] There's a gentleness about you which as you remember from last week means that you're really willing to kind of take the brunt.
[time=1157] You'll take the bullet.
[time=1158] If anybody's going to take it, let me take it.
[time=1162] And you've noticed a patience in your relationships, I mean you are just bearing with other people.
[time=1169] And no matter how they seem to treat you, there's a resource of energy to forgive as it says there in verse 13.
[time=1175] You're willing to pull the lynch pen kind of the traitor of all the stuff they've done to you and it's just kind of gone.
[time=1181] It slips away from you.
[time=1185] Which category are you in this morning?
[time=1189] And now for that fateful moment, I want to invite you to get up mentally, stay where you are, but mentally get up and take your name tag and put it under the appropriate heading.
[time=1207] And I'll tell you what, if you're over here there's some real hope coming your way this morning.
[time=1211] It's exciting stuff.
[time=1214] Because what God's Word is going to do today is going to take two sample sins.
[time=1220] The Lord could have picked any of a thousand sins, but he's picked two in particular.
[time=1224] And what he's going to do is he is going to unveil the anatomy of spiritual decline.
[time=1230] He is going to very carefully show you the steps, the inner workings of the human decision making process that leads to the eventual act of sin.
[time=1241] And it's going to give us a marvelous opportunity to listen to the Word of God and allow it to say some things to us that we might not say to ourselves.
[time=1251] And to help us see some things about ourselves that we might not otherwise see about ourselves so that we can change in some ways that we might not otherwise have been willing to change.
[time=1264] This is just a powerfully insightful, perceptive text that gives us insight into this idea of spiritual decline.
[time=1274] Let's begin in verse five with that first of the sample sins.
[time=1278] Therefore, consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire and greed which amounts to idolatry.
[time=1288] By sample sin, I mean the presenting problem, if you will. It's called immorality.
[time=1294] You see it there? Verse five, immorality. The word is porneia in the Greek.
[time=1299] It's the word from which we get our word pornography.
[time=1302] And it's kind of a garbage can, sexual word of the New Testament.
[time=1307] And it encompasses anything you can think of in terms of illicit sexual behavior.
[time=1315] It's the word that can be used to describe adultery, fornication, homosexuality, bestiality, sex with children, pornography.
[time=1326] I mean this is it. This is the garbage can word of the New Testament.
[time=1334] And like I say this morning, you don't have to be struggling with immorality to benefit from this text.
[time=1339] You just put your presenting problem. You just put your sin in that little line and the rest of this will work out for you.
[time=1344] It just happens. This is the one that Paul picked.
[time=1347] At the same time, there is a likelihood that many of you are struggling.
[time=1353] Many of us are struggling, even with this particular presenting problem.
[time=1360] Now what happens is the text begins to unveil and work down through layers of human decision making and desire.
[time=1369] So that we can repent more completely and more thoroughly, so that we can understand ourselves and know how to describe our repentance and our confession to God.
[time=1379] So he moves from the actual behavior of immorality, whatever that is, to then next, impurity.
[time=1385] Impurity is a word that describes the evil thoughts, the filthy, in this case filthy, sexual intentions that run around in a person's mind,
[time=1395] that articulate a plan that would eventually be carried out, which is the act of immorality.
[time=1401] Behind that is this word passion, pathos.
[time=1407] It is a drive or a force that won't rest until it is satisfied, and that word is pretty commonly understood.
[time=1414] When you are in a heat of passion, you kind of lose your rational capacities and you are now going to get satisfied no matter what.
[time=1421] And you will take risks that are unusual and unreasonable, and you will just do whatever needs to get done because you are in a heat of passion.
[time=1431] Behind that, this next phrase or word in the Greek, evil desires.
[time=1437] This is not a passionate state of arousal, but kind of a constant, normal living state or a mode that you are in all day long.
[time=1448] You fall into the pattern of just in your calm moments having a desire and a longing for the gratification.
[time=1459] It just stays with you all day long. It is just the state of being. It is just the world you live in on the inside, evil desires.
[time=1468] And that all makes, I think, good sense. But then comes this word greed. You see it there?
[time=1474] As he moves back, immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and this one kind of takes you by surprise, greed.
[time=1480] Because we tend to think of greed in terms of wanting material possessions or wanting more money, being greedy, maybe even being greedy for the spotlight or something.
[time=1489] But the word of God reveals to us that as you move back through the sequence of events that have led up to immorality, greed is a major player.
[time=1501] The word greed, it's a compound in the Greek, it's made up of two words, more and to have. Very simple. More coupled with to have.
[time=1509] It's to have to have more. The insatiable desires of selfishness, always wanting more, never satisfied with what you have.
[time=1522] And it is oftentimes in the New Testament coupled with sexual immorality, Ephesians 419 says this, and they having become callous have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.
[time=1538] It is nothing short of a greediness, an insatiable desire, never having enough and always wanting more. And then in this particular situation, that focus is saying, I'll find my satisfaction in the arena of immorality.
[time=1555] And so it gives birth to evil desires, kind of a constant state of being inside that is always looking, always hungry, always wanting.
[time=1563] And then it erupts into passion, the heat of passion, and then those evil thoughts conceive that plan at the last moment and then boom, there it happens, immorality.
[time=1575] But it comes out of a greedy heart. It comes out of a heart that just is never satisfied, it just refuses to have enough.
[time=1583] And then go back one layer behind that and you'll find this, which amounts to idolatry. Can you go, wait a minute, idolatry, I thought that was the stuff you did in front of like an idol.
[time=1594] And you brought things to it and you bowed down in front of it, you went to some wacky temple, I thought that was idolatry.
[time=1600] No, not necessarily, that could be, I mean that is a part of it.
[time=1603] Idolatry, the sum total of this whole deal, he says, boils down to idolatry. It is when a person concentrates their whole being upon something other than God.
[time=1616] Idolatry is simply this, giving your being to the worship, adoration, pursuit of, thinking about anything other than God, or a God honoring life, or working in such a way that you honor God, or spending your money in such a way that you honor God.
[time=1631] I mean it's not just a zombied state of God, it is God and everything you do, he is the passionate pursuit behind it all, he is the reason for it.
[time=1639] Idolatry is a shift away from that into a desire to please yourself. That's all idolatry is.
[time=1650] It is a movement away from the simple purity of pleasing God to the commitment to please yourself.
[time=1659] You couple that, then, and here's the reality, man can never find anything to satisfy himself, which gives birth to his what? His greed.
[time=1668] He has tried to satisfy himself with himself, or by himself, or through himself, and that is impossible, so greed runs rampant.
[time=1675] With greed running rampant, then there is a settled state of affairs inside the human being that is these evil desires, looking for that gratification.
[time=1683] It explodes in moments of passion, the thought process conceives the plan, and the body carries out the act.
[time=1690] And what you've got is the presenting problem, immorality, some type of fornication or sexual sin.
[time=1698] So it all goes back to idolatry. It all goes back to a worship that is other than of God, which is why, and I never saw this before until this week,
[time=1706] which is why when you read the great confession of Psalm 51. Remember David, King David, who had committed the sexual immorality, the Pornea, the presenting problem was sexual immorality?
[time=1716] He cries out in that psalm first that God would forgive him, that God would be gracious and show his loving kindness and blot out his transgression and wash him thoroughly from his iniquity, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1728] And then he switches. Here it comes. He says this, "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."
[time=1737] Why? He finishes it up this way, "O Lord, open my lips, that my mouth may declare thy praises, for thou does not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it, for thou art not pleased with burnt offerings."
[time=1751] Then he says this, "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou will not despise."
[time=1760] He went from his presenting problem, the adultery with Bathsheba, to confess that for what it was.
[time=1765] But then he went to the heart of the problem, which has given me a clean heart so I can worship you.
[time=1771] I've got to stop worshiping me, and I've got to start worshiping you. And so in the language and the style and the form of his day, he says, "Give me, allow me to open my lips and declare your praises, and the sacrifice you want for me is not a bull or a ram, it is a broken spirit and a contrite heart."
[time=1791] You want from my inner man a commitment to worship you, not me.
[time=1798] And so when he makes the final great confession, which he held on and refused to give for nearly a year, it in his mind goes from an obvious confession to the deed and the act itself and the willingness and the desire to be forgiven, and then he goes straight to the core of the problem.
[time=1811] I was worshiping the wrong reality, it was me and I need to worship you.
[time=1816] That is where spiritual decline starts. And in its most subtle and premature forms, it is found in the hearts of people who make the subtle shift from pleasing God to pleasing themselves.
[time=1832] And it sets off a chain reaction inside that human mind and the process of motives and decisions which will eventually culminate in an act of worship of themselves. That sinful behavior.
[time=1848] As I was thinking about Psalm 51 and realizing the condition in which David had fallen, I took great heart and was encouraged and wanted to say these five things to you, listen to this.
[time=1858] Here's a man who committed adultery. Here's a man who murdered the woman's wife.
[time=1863] I say it to you this way, number one, it can happen to anyone.
[time=1867] Spiritual decline can happen to anyone, even someone as faithful and as loyal and as loving as King David, who as you know is remembered as the one with a whole heart for God.
[time=1879] Who had insights into worship as we just saw in Psalm 51 that would stagger the common mind.
[time=1887] It can happen to anyone, it can happen to him and it can happen to you.
[time=1892] Second thing we learned from David's life is this, it is usually attended by severely painful consequences.
[time=1899] You see one embarks into idolatry with the notion that God is not satisfying me, God is not pleasing me, I don't like pleasing God because I don't get pleased.
[time=1907] Idolatry is a statement I will now please myself.
[time=1910] And so this chain reaction starts itself and sin is eventually conceived and what happens?
[time=1915] The inverse happens instead of being pleased, the individual inflicts enormous pain upon himself or herself through the consequences of their behavior.
[time=1924] It never promises what it delivers. Idolatry, self-pleasure, self-seeking endeavors, never result in pleasure.
[time=1932] They always result in pain and painful consequences.
[time=1936] Hebrews tells us and talks about the passing pleasure of sin for a season, but may I assure you it is passing and it is a brief season.
[time=1946] You remember David's pain, there was a conception of a child and not only did he have to live with the fact that he had committed adultery, that his whole nation knew about it and the loss of respect and of course all the other nations of the world to whom he was trying to witness.
[time=1961] Then there was the murder and the loss of respect of all of his military men and the other men who died in the way he murdered her husband.
[time=1969] And then there was the overwhelming grief of the loss of the child that was conceived inside of that.
[time=1975] I mean there's more hurt and more pain than a person would ever want to sign up for in that one event.
[time=1983] Idolatry is attended by severe personal pain.
[time=1991] If you don't think so, just look at the faces of the people around you who are not born again and who do not know to worship the true and living God.
[time=1998] And get past sometimes the thin veneer of life and find out what they have is a world of pain, a world of pain in which they live.
[time=2009] The third thing I was thinking about David is this, there comes with this sin, a ferocious desire not to come clean.
[time=2016] Not to admit, not to confess, David held on to his sin for we think at least a year before he finally penned Psalm 51.
[time=2024] And particularly this kind of sin, sexual sin is the kind of thing that people want to hang on to and keep private and keep secret and not let anybody know about it.
[time=2033] And the longer they do that, the stronger hold it has in their life.
[time=2038] And the more they set themselves up for continued failure and defeat until they may work themselves into positions that are irretrievable, where damage cannot be undone.
[time=2052] Don't wait, don't wait, don't hold on, look that ferocious desire for privacy and to maintain anonymity in your sexual sin in the face and square it down and go tell somebody and get the help that you need.
[time=2069] Fourth thing I wrote down was this, a person can recover as we learn from David's life through repentance and confession.
[time=2079] I mean it sounds impossible and it sounds hard, but just get to the place where you are ready to turn from that sin and then confess it to God and some others who can help you and you'll find that you are back on this side of the ledger.
[time=2092] It's just that fast.
[time=2094] There may be attendant consequences you have to live with, but your heart and your status with God is over here instead of over here, just through repentance and confession.
[time=2103] And the fifth thing I wrote down as I just was thinking about David's life is that God can still use you for his glory when it is all said and done.
[time=2112] One of the great ploys of the enemy is to compromise your integrity somehow, keep you quiet where you can't receive the strength of confession and repentance and then heap upon you the guilt that you are useless to God, because in that state you are.
[time=2127] But he wants you to believe you'll always be that way, not so, not so, let it go and allow God to use you, possibly in a different capacity, but he can use you, he wants to use you, he is waiting to use you.
[time=2147] Look at verse 6, he adds two things in verses 1 and verse 6 and 1 and verse 7 before he leaves this, he says, "For it is an account of these things that the wrath of God will come."
[time=2157] What are you doing over here on this side of the ledger?
[time=2159] Don't you know you're born again?
[time=2161] Don't you know that you have been forgiven by God through the wonderful grace of God and yet you're over here in this kind of behavior, and it's that very kind of behavior that provokes the wrath of God?
[time=2172] And this is not a threat that you can lose your salvation and go to hell, this is just a statement, what in the world are you doing on that side of the equation, which is the equation which provokes the wrath of God?
[time=2183] That's not who you are, that's not where you belong, get out of there.
[time=2189] And then verse 70 says, "And in them also you once walked when you were living in them." Don't you remember that that was rightfully where you belonged and then you met Christ?
[time=2201] And in your decision to come to Christ, this thing got moved off that side of the wall and put over there, you've already done all that stuff, that's in your past, that's who you were, let it go, get past it, why are you returning back to that kind of stuff again?
[time=2215] You've done that as the phrase goes, been there, seen that, done that, let me out of that, don't go back.
[time=2226] Then he gives a second sample sin, look at it in verse 8, only this time he reverses the order, in verse 5 he started with the behavior, the immorality and worked all the way back to idolatry, in verse 8 he starts with the core problem and works his way out to what it evidences itself in, verse 8.
[time=2245] But now you also put them all aside, anger, wrath, malice, slander and abusive speech from your mouth, do not lie to one another, what's the presenting problem here?
[time=2257] Slander, slander constitutes false charges and misrepresentations that defame and damage another's reputation, that's what slander is.
[time=2267] Anytime you say something, anytime you leave it in your window, anytime through your silence, anytime through however you communicate something of the substance of false charges and misrepresentations that defame and damage another person's reputation, you're involved in slander.
[time=2282] Abusive speech is filthy talk or dirty speech, and in the context I believe it is the kind of stuff that gets added to slander to make it even more poignant or strong or abrasive or defaming.
[time=2299] And then of course it represents a lie because these would be false charges and misrepresentations, and a lie basically is the intent to deceive for the purpose of personal gain, and in this context to tear somebody else down through false charges, false misrepresentations to build yourself up and you throw some abusive speech in there along the way.
[time=2318] That's the presenting problem.
[time=2321] That is the behavior that we can witness and see. You say what's behind all that stuff, where does that come from? Well let's start at the core of it in verse 8 with anger.
[time=2332] All that stuff the Bible says comes out of an angry heart, and this is the kind of anger that is deep down inside of a person that is smoldering day in and day out, it's just always there.
[time=2345] It's at the core level, if you could take in one of those meat testers at Thanksgiving and pop it in yourself, what you'd read on the dial would be I'm mad at God, I'm mad at people, I'm mad at life, and I'm mad at myself.
[time=2358] I'm just mad, I'm just angry inside, and I can mask it and I can hide it in a lot of situations, but if you want to know the truth, I am an angry person inside, that's what you get on that reading.
[time=2372] Now it does bubble over from time to time, that's the next word, wrath, anger and then wrath. Wrath is the word used to describe the explosive, kind of the blazing red hot expression of that anger.
[time=2382] When it finally, the anger is provoked, it comes out, and when it comes out in either whatever kinds of words or actions or behavior, that's the wrath.
[time=2394] You say what's next in the sequence, malice, listen to this word, this is unbelievable, malice is the attitude of ill will towards someone else.
[time=2404] It's when you hold ill will towards someone else, and as I said in the survey at the beginning of the hour, you are sad when somebody else prospers.
[time=2413] And you kind of, you get the fact that they're moving ahead in life and it like hurts, it's bad, you're resentful of it.
[time=2423] Firstly, you are happy when you hear that they have had a setback or a failure.
[time=2427] That reveals to you that one little emotion reveals to you that there is a problem, a sequence of events, and you've just plugged into the one of them called malice.
[time=2438] And repentance would mean looking backwards through the wrath and back to the anger.
[time=2450] So there is that sequence of events, that's how that works.
[time=2454] You're involved in slander, you're involved in abusive speech, you're lying to somebody about something, a lot of the word of God to say for you what you might not say about yourself.
[time=2464] It is because there is a bottom line level, a reservoir of anger that resides inside of you, that boils over from time to time in wrath, that evidence is an attitude of malice and ill will towards other people.
[time=2478] Now let me just say this, anger is nothing more than frustrated idolatry.
[time=2484] You get that?
[time=2486] The bottom line in immorality is idolatry, right?
[time=2489] Pleaseing yourself.
[time=2490] The bottom line in abusive speech is anger and you say what's the relationship between the two?
[time=2495] It's a direct connection.
[time=2497] When you start saying to yourself idolatry, I'm going to please myself, and you as everybody else does, figure out that you're not big enough and strong enough and powerful enough to orchestrate all the events of your life to please.
[time=2507] As much as you need to be pleased to be pleased, when that gold gets blocked, you get angry.
[time=2516] And that's why you get mad at people because they won't cooperate with your idolatry's heart to please yourself.
[time=2528] They are brothers and sisters in the same problem.
[time=2532] The commitment to please yourself, you never can do it, and so anger results.
[time=2540] It's an amazing connection.
[time=2543] And as I say, he could have put any sin in here.
[time=2545] This isn't the big bad thing about sexual sin, although that is bad, and it's not a big bad thing about slander, although that is bad.
[time=2552] He is just using those to begin to work his way back through the layers of human motive and thought processes to the core of the problem, which ultimately is idolatry.
[time=2561] So you say, "Okay, I get it. What do I do about it?"
[time=2570] Now come on, help me.
[time=2572] I believe that I would be over here, and I don't want to be over here.
[time=2578] Well, I wish I had more time to develop this text because it really gives five things you can do.
[time=2584] Five things you can do. Come to verse 14, I'll just list them, but I want to focus on one.
[time=2590] Five things that you can do, verse 14, he gives the first one.
[time=2593] Beyond all these things, put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.
[time=2598] Now what is love? Again, love is when I am more committed to pleasing you than I am to pleasing me.
[time=2606] But it's in terms of relationships here on earth.
[time=2609] You want an anecdote to idolatry, to pleasing yourself, get up every morning and say, "What would it mean for me to serve and love the people in my world?"
[time=2618] And then get about it.
[time=2621] The second one is in verse 15, "And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you are called to one body and be thankful."
[time=2629] But we could spend some time on this one.
[time=2631] To let the peace of Christ rule in your heart means this.
[time=2633] When you are at a decision point in life, and there are many of them in every hour and many of them in every day, the grid by which you make your decision, not just moral or immoral, as the word of God would reveal,
[time=2644] but which one keeps you at peace with Christ?
[time=2648] Which one allows you and the Lord to move in harmony and unity into that decision and that course of behavior?
[time=2656] So you constantly walk around with the Lord Jesus Christ and His satisfaction and what keeps you at peace with Him as the rule of your heart.
[time=2666] The rule means umpire. It is the one that makes the decision about the tricky calls.
[time=2673] It is walking in peace with Christ. The third one, verse 16.
[time=2678] "Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you," and I'm going to come back to that in a minute.
[time=2682] The fourth one in verse 17, "And whatever you do in word or deed do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[time=2688] giving thanks through Him to God the Father." What that means, do everything that's consistent with the name. To do something in the name of is to do things consistent with the Lord.
[time=2696] Do this? Yes, I'll do it. Would the Lord not do this? No, I won't do it.
[time=2702] And the fifth one talks about, back in verse 5, it says, "Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead.
[time=2711] You actually commit spiritual suicide with that part of who you are.
[time=2715] You start the process of killing off the immorality and the impurity and the passion and the evil desire and the grieve and the idolatry by starving it."
[time=2725] I'm not talking about asceticism. I'm talking about starving all the influences that promote that kind of junk in your life.
[time=2733] But let me settle here on verse 16 for a minute.
[time=2738] The number one anecdote to idolatry and all that it produces is this book, this very true and living word.
[time=2750] This is not merely the product of human pin.
[time=2754] This is the true, inspired, empowered word of God.
[time=2759] The Bible calls itself living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword.
[time=2762] And if you want the power and the strength and the source of stuff to begin to turn your heart back to God and get back on pleasing Him instead of pleasing yourself,
[time=2771] it comes through allowing this word to richly dwell within you.
[time=2776] What that means, to richly dwell, it is at home.
[time=2781] It is at home. And the imagery is of every room in your life.
[time=2785] There is no category in your life where there is a door that is locked by a key and the word of God doesn't have rain in that category.
[time=2794] You hold back just one category of your life, my friends.
[time=2799] Listen to this, you hold back one category of your life and you have put yourself back over there on spiritual decline.
[time=2811] You cannot handle it. Your life is not, like I say sometimes, a frozen dinner where all these little compartments and you can have righteousness, righteousness, righteousness, righteousness, sin.
[time=2821] But the sin is compartmentalized and it can't seep out and get the other parts.
[time=2826] That is not the biblical view of man.
[time=2830] You are a chicken pot pie.
[time=2833] All right? All those little components are mixed into one thing and if there is a bad component, it contaminates all the rest.
[time=2841] You simply cannot fool yourself into thinking that you can obey Him in 99% of the categories.
[time=2847] But let me keep this one category for me.
[time=2852] It doesn't work that way. It will not work that way.
[time=2856] You will not grow. You will not have success in your spiritual walk with God.
[time=2860] Trust me, eradicate it, confess it and give all of your life.
[time=2867] That doesn't mean you become a missionary. That doesn't mean you become a...
[time=2870] What I mean is every category is submitted in obedience to the truth.
[time=2874] That is what it means to let the Word of Christ richly dwell, be at home in your body, in your person.
[time=2883] Anything short of that, it doesn't work that way.
[time=2889] I used this by permission. I just want to lift this guy up.
[time=2892] I wish I could actually have him here on stage. He would be willing. It would be inappropriate.
[time=2897] I even spoke to him again this morning.
[time=2900] There's a guy in our church. He's been coming here for a while and he struggled terribly in his life with sin.
[time=2906] And it's the kind of sin that is even repulsive.
[time=2910] It's an immorality. He has been an abuser sexually of children.
[time=2915] He has been convicted of this. He is going to prison. He is just waiting for sentencing.
[time=2922] But man has got to work in his life because verse 16.
[time=2929] He came to this church and he realized that he had never been discipled by anyone and he realized that he had never spent time in God's Word on a regular consistent basis.
[time=2940] Having been convicted was desperate and sickened with himself and absolutely exhausted in his life to try to resist this evilness inside of him.
[time=2950] And he carries a lot of baggage. He was himself sexually molested for the first time when he was seven by a family member.
[time=2957] And then other times at least twice that he knows of and can remember later in his life.
[time=2963] I mean his life is a cauldron of sexual impurity and immorality and he's wallowing in it.
[time=2973] He approaches an older man in our church about 50 years of age and says would you disciple me?
[time=2978] This is my problem. This is what I am. This is what I do.
[time=2982] This is where I'm at and I need help.
[time=2987] And the disciple who I also talked to and used his comments with permission said you know I was frankly repulsed.
[time=2994] I just couldn't see myself in a meaningful relationship with someone who had done these kinds of things.
[time=2999] And then he said after I got through seeking God's forgiveness for that attitude.
[time=3005] Isn't that great? I agree to do it.
[time=3009] He says I want you to know he told me this over breakfast this week.
[time=3012] He didn't know I was even preaching on this and it just happened to fit the passage perfectly.
[time=3015] So I asked these guys permission to share it with you.
[time=3017] He looks at me over breakfast today and he says do you know something I have never experienced.
[time=3021] More intimate and meaningful fellowship with any other believer in all my life.
[time=3026] This guy is so honest and so repentant and so ready to confess his sin and his hunger for the word of God is just unbelievable.
[time=3035] And that's what the disciple said to him at the beginning of the process.
[time=3038] He says you want to change, you want to grow, you want to break this stuff then you have got to get in the word and let it richly dwell within you.
[time=3045] And so this faithful pupil did it.
[time=3048] He has now memorized the entire chapter of Romans 6.
[time=3052] It's right here in his head.
[time=3054] And then he memorized Romans 7.
[time=3057] And if you know the content of those chapters you know how appropriate that is when you're trying to break a strong propensity to sin.
[time=3063] And he's on his way to memorizing Romans 8.
[time=3067] He's not doing verses.
[time=3068] He's just consuming entire chapters at a time.
[time=3074] Because what he wants is he wants not a mind that is benefited by therapy.
[time=3078] He wants a new mind.
[time=3080] Do you understand?
[time=3082] He wants the kind of mind that only the word of God can renew Romans 12 1 and 2.
[time=3089] And so he faithfully and diligently dedicates himself to this consistent study of God's word.
[time=3094] He is now in the process of studying the book of Colossians and every time he goes to study it he reads the entire book all at once and then he goes back and studies whatever portion is there for his daily study.
[time=3108] His disciple taught him to do this, meditate on the word of God which one means memorize.
[time=3113] And then he said now you personalize it which means take and put your name in that verse as you're saying.
[time=3118] And in this case in these chapters and read your name as you say it to yourself and then his disciples said this and then visualize it which he means by that to see yourself living out the obedience in those verses and in those scriptures.
[time=3135] Begin to visualize yourself living that stuff out in obedience to God's word.
[time=3143] This is I've never seen somebody like this.
[time=3145] I've never seen such a insatiable desire because the need is so great and the humility is so profound and the willingness is just overwhelming.
[time=3156] As I was talking to him this morning just trying to make sure I didn't you know tell this wrong or do something inappropriate here.
[time=3165] The disciple reports some amazing shifts in his behavior and it's all due to the word of God he says.
[time=3170] Listen to this number one he says when this guy used to confess his sin he would confess it but then he'd always justify himself based upon past times where he'd been victimized.
[time=3180] Based upon circumstances in his life he'd always find a way to somehow slip in a justification with his confession he says now it's gone.
[time=3188] No more justification he just steps up to the table and confesses his sin and I don't mean that sexual kind of sin we've been talking about just whatever sins in his life at that time.
[time=3197] He just confesses it.
[time=3200] He says I've noticed that his prayers have changed and he no longer prays he used to pray for no time in prison or for a reduced time in prison and I can certainly relate to that.
[time=3210] I mean if I had to go to prison I think I'd be asking God to make that as short as possible.
[time=3214] He's now praying that God's will be done.
[time=3217] He's saying God when I go to prison I want to go to prison as long as you want me in prison.
[time=3222] As long as you need me in prison to perform the kind of surgery on my heart and my soul and my life Hebrews 12 so that I'll yield the fruit of discipline the fruit of righteousness which comes from discipline.
[time=3236] He said to me this morning I'm scared I don't want to go to prison I don't know what's going to happen to me in prison.
[time=3242] That's an understatement sexual offenders are not usually real high on the totem pole inside of the prison hierarchy because you know what I'm excited because I'm going to get to study God's word.
[time=3255] I'll have time to study God's word in a way I never otherwise would have had.
[time=3260] He says I want to reach people for Christ in prison.
[time=3265] Now why am I telling you this because listen you got problems in your life right you got sin in your life and maybe it's not as ugly as this one.
[time=3275] Maybe it's not as entrapping as this one maybe it's not tied to some of the victimization of past like this guy has but listen if the word of God can be in the process of absolutely transforming a person in his mind and his motives and his desires we can do it to you.
[time=3292] God can do this in your life and he can do it in my life.
[time=3298] Remember 1 Corinthians 6.
[time=3300] Listen off the fornicators the idolaters the adulters the effeminence the homosexuals the thieves the covetous the drunkards the revilers the swindlers and he says and such were some of you.
[time=3313] But you were washed you were sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the spirit of God.
[time=3321] Take heart my friends take heart my friends if you are over there today or when you walked in God is speaking to you and he is saying to you you've got a repent from the idolatrous heart that drives this whole thing and get back on track pleasing me.
[time=3340] There's real life in pleasing me and he's saying there is hope in the power of the word of God to do that changing.
[time=3352] Just need you to be willing and diligent and it can change. Let's pray together.
[time=3378] Well this passage leads us to discuss some pretty heavy stuff and I don't know where you are in your life what you're struggling with just how compulsive or addictive the behavior you've found yourself in is in your life.
[time=3392] But obviously that whole gamut of sexual sin can be dealt with through the power of God and his word that's true also of alcohol and drugs.
[time=3402] There's the possibility you're struggling with stealing things from your employer and you've gotten yourself in a rhythm there and you feel trapped and you don't know how to get out and you feel as though there's no help and there's no place to turn and that's just not true.
[time=3415] The power of God is a mighty thing and in confessing your sin and accepting Christ as your personal Lord and Savior you can find real help and it will make a difference and you can live differently through the power of God.
[time=3428] It all begins by accepting Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and I'm going to pray here in just a moment a prayer that if you will pray in your heart to God he will hear you he'll answer your prayer and he'll save you through Christ and the road to recovery can begin right now.
[time=3443] Father I know that I am a sinner and I know that I have begun to be involved in things which do not honor you and which are tearing my life apart.
[time=3453] I pray that you would forgive me for my sin to the person of Jesus Christ and through him give me the power to change my life and to live a whole complete life that honors and glorifies you.
[time=3464] Thank you for the forgiveness through Christ in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3469] Well if you just prayed that prayer that's the beginning but you need help as you move out of some of these compulsive behaviors and we'd love for you to write us here at the Bible hour and let us know about the decision you've made and we'd love to be of assistance to you.
