[time=0] God has called you, and God has equipped you, and God has strategically placed you in your
[time=9] place of employment.
[time=10] And He intends to use you for mighty and great things.
[time=14] And He is as interested and involved and committed to what you will do tomorrow at this time
[time=20] as what you are doing right now at this particular time.
[time=29] Welcome to the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=33] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=35] The Christian in the workplace.
[time=36] Did you know that God has some very specific instructions for you at work that will affect
[time=42] every aspect of your job?
[time=44] Do you know what God's expectations are for you at work?
[time=47] Well, stay with us today as Pastor Moore explains God's instructions and expectations
[time=53] for the Christian at work.
[time=55] Now let's join our service.

[time=75] And falling down at your funsto, I offer my heart of grace.
[time=83] I humble this Lord, I'm let me by Your name.
[time=89] You are the Holy One.
[time=97] You are the righteous judge.
[time=105] Creator of my life and sustainer of my soul.
[time=117] I humble myself before you, falling down at your feet.
[time=126] I humble myself before the king of kings.
[time=134] You worshiping at your footstool, I offer my heart of grace.

[time=785] [MUSIC]
[time=799] [APPLAUSE]
[time=805] Thank you, Susan.
[time=807] Let me invite you this morning to take your Bible and come to Colossians 3.
[time=813] The Word of God directs our thinking this morning to the place of employment.
[time=819] We're going to receive truth this morning about the kinds of employees that we are, and then briefly at the end a little bit about the employer.
[time=828] When I was at the Masters College, we had as a major theme in the hearts and lives of our faculty and administration,
[time=835] and we tried our best in chapel in every occasion to communicate to the students that there is no dichotomy
[time=842] between those whom God calls into the ministry, so to speak, and secular work.
[time=850] We did all within our power to break down the notion in their mind that there was this unique special calling of God on some people's lives.
[time=859] The people who would go into the mission field, the people who would go into the ministry, and everybody else was just kind of existing.
[time=866] Oh, yeah, they were Christians, but they were kind of left on their own to kind of find their way into the world and their job.
[time=873] Well, yeah, there was an opportunity for witness and maybe that was at best an opportunity to make money and support your family
[time=879] and provide for the needs of your church.
[time=882] And you know that notion is never taught anywhere in Scripture.
[time=886] It is true that in the Old Testament, particularly you'll find the special calling of God and even in the New Testament and some of the Apostles' lives
[time=894] directly into ministry, and so in that sense there is a calling.
[time=898] But what you'll find over and over and over again in the New Testament is that God is busy calling each and every person in the body of Christ to a unique sphere of influence.
[time=909] And that includes where they go to church and that includes where they live, what neighborhood they may locate in, and it really includes their job where they will spend far more time than they ever will sitting in church.
[time=922] Do you realize that you're going to spend more time and have spent more time in training and will invest more effort and energy inside the confines of what you and I call work than you ever will inside church?
[time=934] And it isn't at all a correct notion of life to say that my spirituality exists over here in church and then the rest, the secular part of my life which I just somehow kind of endure is my work.
[time=946] It says in Ephesians 2 that you, each and every one of us, not just those who have been led into full-time ministry, but every single one of us.
[time=956] We are a workmanship of God, Ephesians 2.10 says.
[time=960] We have been made masterpieces as it were in the eyes of God for specific good works which he has prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.
[time=970] And I think you'll see very clearly this morning that a lot of what he has made you to do and a lot of the good works which he holds out before you and much of the way that you will worship and minister to him and in his name happens tomorrow morning when you get up and go to work.
[time=987] God is committed and vitally interested in giving you instruction that you should be faithful and effective and that in fact he is a part of all of that.
[time=996] It is for him and through his power and to his glory that you work, not in a generic way but in a very, very specific way.
[time=1004] Now as I studied this passage just kind of as a backdrop, this week I was struck with a notion that this may be one of the most radical calls to obedience in all the Word of God.
[time=1017] You may look hard and long before you find a call to a level of obedience and self-sacrifice anywhere other more extreme than you find it right here.
[time=1029] Why? Well look at the first word there in verse 22.
[time=1034] It says slaves, slaves, there were some 60 million of them in the Roman Empire at the time of the writing of this book.
[time=1044] Nearly a third of the inhabitants in Rome would have been slaves.
[time=1049] And they had become slaves as prisoners of war, as convicts through their own indebtedness by having been kidnapped into slavery, purchased and sold into slavery or birth into slavery by slave parents.
[time=1065] They came from all different angles, all many, many roads as it were led to slavery in Rome.
[time=1072] There was a preponderance of them, and they in that day and age were nothing more than a piece of property.
[time=1078] They had no more status and no more rights than the beast of burden that the owner also happened to own, an ox or a camel or a donkey or whatever it might have been, his pleasure to carry out the work in his estate or his life.
[time=1094] These slaves were called to work at whatever their master told them to do. They had no way really to pick and choose the type of work they would do.
[time=1102] They were subject to the whim of their master. There were no labor laws. There was no government intervention.
[time=1108] The only thing the government had to say about a master and his slave is that the slave is the total sole property of the master.
[time=1115] And the master could beat the slave, the master could imprison the slave, and the master could kill the slave with no justification needed.
[time=1124] He had total sovereignty over that other human being's life.
[time=1129] There were no governing laws of human decency. A slave could take a child that had been born by one of his slaves and sell it off.
[time=1137] Any time he wanted to, for any price, masters could destroy the home. A master could come to the wife of another slave and say you will bear a child by him because the gene pool will work a little better in this combination, and she had to do it.
[time=1154] The masters could beat their slaves and whip their slaves, and these slaves oftentimes would live in severe, harsh conditions of absolute poverty all the days of their lives.
[time=1167] There was no court of appeal. There was no way out. There was no hope for a future. There was no, in most cases, the sense that eventually I'll get out of this.
[time=1177] Now this kind of condition, this reality is what Paul is writing to.
[time=1184] And I found myself somewhat shocked as I realized all of that this week, wondering why the Lord didn't abolish it.
[time=1191] Why doesn't this verse read this way, verse 22? Slaves.
[time=1195] You, now that you are saved, have permission to revolt and do whatever you have to do to stop being slaves.
[time=1203] And then a rationale could be built, because you were created in the image of God, and in the image of God you have dignity, and in your dignity you have no business being owned by another mere human.
[time=1216] You are my soul property. It doesn't say that, and it doesn't say that anywhere in Scripture.
[time=1222] You will never find an injunction in Scripture to a slave other than obey. There's one exception to that, and that is if you have the opportunity to be free.
[time=1231] If you are an indentured servant and your time is up, or someone would redeem you and buy you out of the hands.
[time=1236] I mean, that's okay. If you can get free, get free, but it had to be through very legal, normal means.
[time=1242] And from the majority of slaves, no such opportunity would ever present itself.
[time=1249] I was shocked really at how God would call people not only to stay in that, but to stay in that for their entire life, and then to stay in it in the way you'll see.
[time=1260] He really raises the standard here of how effectively and how hard, and how diligently the slave is to work, and with what motive, and with what intention.
[time=1270] But in another way, as I studied this text this week, I was astounded for another reason, because it dawned on me as I looked at the principles of this text.
[time=1279] I realized that even if you were a slave in the worst of those conditions, if you will apply the truth in this passage, you will have value.
[time=1289] You will have personal value, and you will have character, and you will have a sense of purpose in each and every day, and there is a sense of hope because of the truth in this particular passage.
[time=1301] So while he does not allow them to extricate themselves through force or violence or upheaval from their condition as slaves, he does in the midst of that very hard situation give them the ingredients to give them value and character and purpose and hope.
[time=1318] Now, principally as you know, as you can see, written to slaves, but applicable to us.
[time=1323] Those of us who are employees, and those of us who are employers, the principles of these truths apply to our lives, and there are four of them.
[time=1335] There are four of them this morning, and we'll just move right through them.
[time=1338] Number one, in verse 22, slaves in all things obey those who are your masters on earth.
[time=1347] That's principle number one.
[time=1349] Employee, listen carefully, obey your employer.
[time=1355] The way I said it in my notes, do it, do it right, and do it right now.
[time=1361] What your employer is asking you to do, do it, do it right, and do it right now.
[time=1367] And obey your employee in everything.
[time=1370] Now think of the wisdom and the beauty of this.
[time=1372] Picture in your mind for a moment a 16 year old high school student who in this upcoming summer is going to get his very first job or her very first job and let's say it's at Burger King.
[time=1382] Now just listen to the wisdom of this.
[time=1384] You got a kid that's programmed because of his relationship with God to go into that place and obey everything he is told or she is told to do, and he's going to do it, and he's going to do it right, and he's going to do it right now.
[time=1395] You got immediate obedience, complete obedience to the master or to the employer.
[time=1399] Guess who's going to be distinguished very soon as the outstanding employee of the century.
[time=1405] A 25 year old pharmaceutical salesperson who gets a job and is being trained by the trainer and reports to a regional manager, that person, he or she, comes to work every day with a predominant thought.
[time=1417] I will do it, I will do it right, and I will do it right now.
[time=1420] However you say for it to be done.
[time=1422] I am an obedient employee.
[time=1425] Now those of you who are employers are going where do I find these people?
[time=1429] How can I hire them?
[time=1431] Give me a list, I'll take all of those you've got.
[time=1434] A 40 year old branch manager at NBD Bank comes to work every day saying I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it right, and I'm going to do it right now.
[time=1443] I'm going to do everything.
[time=1445] The things I like about my job and don't like about my job, the things I'm good at in my job and not good at in my job, the things that make sense to me in my job and the things that don't make sense to me in my job.
[time=1454] The things that are easy and come natural to me in my job and the things that are hard and laborious in my job.
[time=1459] I just do it all.
[time=1461] I just get all excited and pumped up about being obedient.
[time=1466] The Bible is saying this, do what your employer wants you to do, the way he or she wants you to do it, and when he or she wants you to do it every single time.
[time=1481] Now you're not perfect now, I'm not either, but that's the commitment.
[time=1484] Do what your employer wants you to do, do it the way he wants you to do it, do it when he wants you to do it every single time.
[time=1492] Your employer wants a report filled out a particular way, filled out that particular way, on time, neatly.
[time=1499] The floor is supposed to get cleaned before everybody goes home and it's got to get cleaned this way using these particular things, clean it that way using those particular things, every single time.
[time=1509] The books got to get closed just in such and such a way, close them in just such and such a way.
[time=1515] Your employer wants that customer handled it a certain way, handle that customer in that way regardless of how you may feel about that customer or what that customer deserves or doesn't deserve.
[time=1524] Obey your master in everything.
[time=1527] Make it your goal to learn from and understand the wishes and the desires of your employer, not just the procedures and the policies.
[time=1537] You're going to obey at a level that requires you to go and learn and understand and have perception as to what they intended in those procedures and policies and then fulfill all that.
[time=1550] You are an aggressive individual when it comes to responsiveness to the wishes, desires, policies, mandates and procedures of your employer.
[time=1560] Let me tell you what the opposite of this is, rebellion. That's all that is.
[time=1567] There is something in our day and age of rebellion and it pervades the spirit and the mental atmosphere of our day.
[time=1575] And we are so twisted as a culture that there is almost a sense of integrity and wholesomeness and wholeness when you rebel against the authority.
[time=1588] You resist. Any form of resisting, any form of dragging your feet, any form of skeptical sarcasm that undermines and direct or indirect ways, the intentions of your employer in that workplace is rebellion.
[time=1604] Covertly or overtly? That's the standard. Any time you find yourself saying, "He wants me to do it this way, but," or, "She just comes in here and tells us how to do our job," blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[time=1621] Or, "You won't believe what those bozos want us to do now."
[time=1628] Those kinds of statements, that kind of conversation, that kind of dialogue, that kind of thinking is rebellion.
[time=1634] It is outside of God's parameters for your life as an employee.
[time=1639] Now, that doesn't mean your boss is always right. That doesn't mean your boss wouldn't be grateful for insight from people in the front line.
[time=1645] That particular policy probably won't work for these reasons, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1650] But it does mean until they change that policy, you are doing it, you're doing it right, and you're doing it right now.
[time=1657] That's the standard. Now, it gets very difficult.
[time=1661] Because many of you work for unsaved people, and your unsaved person, while some of them are incredibly skilled and have their lives to a level of discipline and order that they don't negatively impact the work environment,
[time=1675] a number of you work for unsaved people who will make very bad decisions, who will make decisions that will then ripple down and make life hard on everybody else in that organization.
[time=1686] And here's how it goes. Because they're unsaved in your mind, and that was clearly an unwise decision, then I don't really have to implement that.
[time=1696] I don't really have to be obedient. I don't really have to give myself to that.
[time=1701] You've got to purge that out of your system. That is just a veiled form of rebellion.
[time=1710] I was struck this week by a conversation occurring between our Lord and a very, very strong, powerful dynamic leader.
[time=1716] He was a centurion. You can read about it in Matthew 8. Now, a centurion didn't become a centurion and have charge over all of these men unless he himself was a proven leader, an aggressive, strong, capable individual.
[time=1729] And here he is overseeing a contingent of the mightiest military force in the known world at that time.
[time=1736] And he says to our Lord this, "For I too am a man under authority," and that phrase just jumped out at me.
[time=1745] "A man under authority." He says this, "With soldiers under me, and I say to this one go, and he goes, and I say to another come, and he comes, and to my slave do this, and he does it."
[time=1757] You've got two very strong, powerful personalities, one the centurion, and then the other, the Lord, which dwarfs the former.
[time=1764] The Lord too was a very strong, powerful leader, and we would agree has changed the course of human history more than any other man or any other leader.
[time=1771] But both of these men, and all their strength, and all their power, and all their charisma, both were men under authority.
[time=1779] Each of these men had demonstrated in their life the ability to submit to the authority above them and do it and do it right and do it right now every time, particularly our Lord.
[time=1790] And John, the Gospel of John, our Lord says, "I always do the things that are pleasing to my Father who is in heaven."
[time=1799] You see, his entire earthly mission was one long protracted point of obedience to the will of the authority in his life, namely God the Father.
[time=1809] He was a powerful leader, and he was dynamic because he was a man under authority.
[time=1814] He was disciplined. He was able to harness and corral his own rebellion completely and totally, as was this centurion.
[time=1822] You see, these two dynamic individuals, and they both know what it means to be men under authority, and they don't shun it, and they don't have a lack of respect for it.
[time=1831] It's almost a badge of growth and maturity.
[time=1837] In your workplace, be a man or a woman under authority. Understand the dignity. Understand the virtue.
[time=1845] Understand the character involved in being able to submit to another person's wishes on a regular basis consistently and faithfully carrying out and dispatching their desire.
[time=1856] Now, of course, the Word of God does make exception to this obedience.
[time=1861] When what is being asked is unethical, immoral, or sinful.
[time=1866] And according to Acts 5.29, where those in view there say, "We must obey God rather than men," that is the overarching principle.
[time=1874] And any time you're a boss, any time you're an employer, any time you're an organization, any time anything, an authority over you requires you to disobey God.
[time=1883] You just go right ahead and disobey that authority and take the consequences. Lose your job.
[time=1888] There's never a reason to violate the morality and the biblical standard of truth.
[time=1893] If it's not in that category, if it's not a right or wrong issue, then your compulsion before God is to obey completely the wishes of your master.
[time=1903] That's very simple, isn't it? Very, very clear.
[time=1908] God wants you to go to work tomorrow morning actively seeking to satisfy the wishes and the desires of your employer.
[time=1918] Principle number two, again, it's found in verse 22, "Slaves in all things, obey those who are your masters on earth."
[time=1927] Now, here it is.
[time=1928] "Not with external service as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord."
[time=1937] God not only wants you to obey your employer and everything, he wants you to do it from your heart.
[time=1945] "Sincerity of heart" means an undivided heart.
[time=1948] "Obey because that is the kind of person you have chosen to be." And this is where a lot of the dignity continues to flow into your life or into the life of one of these slaves.
[time=1959] God is saying, "Hey, stand up and make a decision based upon principle.
[time=1964] Say, I have decided to be the kind of person who submits to the authority in my life, and I choose this out of my own personal convictions and my own undivided heart.
[time=1974] And I don't make this decision because of bad consequences that may become.
[time=1978] I see the virtue and the beauty and the wonder of being a person under authority, and so I have made personal decision and conviction to be that kind of person."
[time=1989] It's a wonderful truth and it's very freeing and very liberating.
[time=1994] "Obey out of internal conviction and principle." Now, in this little verse, he shows two categories of workers.
[time=2001] One is a man pleaser worker and the other is a God pleaser worker.
[time=2006] A man pleaser worker works for external service as those who merely please men and the original there language would be when the master's eye is upon you or to please the eye of the master.
[time=2021] A man pleaser is someone who makes decisions about what they will do or will not do in the workplace along these lines.
[time=2029] Is my boss looking?
[time=2031] I may do this, I may not do this.
[time=2034] Is he going to see?
[time=2036] Is she going to know?
[time=2038] Will he or she find out?
[time=2040] What will my boss do if I don't do this right?
[time=2043] And then finds out.
[time=2045] That's a man pleaser attitude and a man pleaser in the workplace is unstable, unreliable, untrustworthy and unmotivated.
[time=2052] Why?
[time=2053] Because the boss can't always see everything and so as soon as you are out of the prusal of the boss, you've lost your motivation for doing right, for working hard, for doing it as it ought to be done.
[time=2067] A God pleaser on the other hand is a person who says I will work and work hard and do it right not because my boss will or will not see me.
[time=2079] I will do it because I want to honor God with my life.
[time=2084] God is the audience of one and he sees everything I do, practicing the presence of Jesus at work.
[time=2090] He's with you when your boss is not with you and it is the God who you are seeking to please, not your employer.
[time=2097] Joseph had this remarkable category or characteristic.
[time=2101] In Genesis 42.18 Joseph said this, "I fear God." He was saying to this other person, "You can trust me because I fear God." Now think about his life for a minute.
[time=2114] That may be the stabilizing rudder in his entire experience.
[time=2118] As you know, he was sold at a very tender young age out from underneath parental authority as a slave by his brothers.
[time=2127] He was not around his mom or his dad or his brothers. He was not around his friends. He was not around his Israel culture.
[time=2133] He didn't have any of the external support systems to keep people obedient as a lot of us are prone to lean on which is healthy and good when they're around.
[time=2142] He lived in the constant fear of God and through his entire life we never see him abusing his power and he had enormous power through his life.
[time=2150] We never see him stealing anything. We never see him cheating anyone and we never see him lying and we never see him compromising his integrity.
[time=2158] In fact, probably the greatest insight in the fact that he fears God was in that moment when his master was not looking.
[time=2165] His master couldn't see what his wife was doing.
[time=2169] The master's wife had Joseph alone in the house. He was there unsuspecting doing his duties. Didn't realize he was falling into a trap.
[time=2176] They were all alone. She had him cornered. She was dressed seductively. She was after him inviting him to commit adultery with her.
[time=2184] Had absolute power over that house besides the master himself.
[time=2189] And when he refused to commit that sin with her, he didn't say, "I'm not going to do this because I'm afraid of what the master may say when he finds out."
[time=2198] What he said was, "How can I do this great evil and sin against my God?"
[time=2205] He had a bigger issue in his mind. He was a faithful, loyal, hardworking, valuable slave because he was honoring God and he could be trusted in any circumstance whether the boss could see or not to honor God.
[time=2221] That's the standard. That's what it means. Not to be a man pleaser, to be a God pleaser. Paul says this,
[time=2230] "For I am seeking the favor of men or God," he says, asking the question, "For am I seeking the favor of God or men?
[time=2237] Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a bond slave of Christ."
[time=2244] He's saying there are only two categories that people fall into. You either a man pleaser or a God pleaser. If you're a God pleaser, you can't be a man pleaser.
[time=2252] It's impossible. And if you're a Christ pleaser, forget it. Live for him and for him alone. You're either one or the other.
[time=2262] Which one are you at work? What drives you? What motivates you? Have you moved past the very simplistic motive of pleasing men and seeing everything you do every moment of the day in the very presence of Christ himself to honor and glorify his name?
[time=2285] So this text says, number one, obey in everything. Obey your master in everything. Number two, do it out of a principled choice, not out of expedience.
[time=2297] Number three, pursue excellence, not success. Pursue excellence, not success. Verse 23, "Whatever you do, do your work heartily as for the Lord rather than for men."
[time=2314] What does that mean? Hardily. It means with your whole heart. You say, obey them in everything. Obey them from your heart in everything and then work with all your heart as you obey them.
[time=2326] Throw yourself at the endeavor. Go for it. Become immersed in it. It means to work energetically or diligently.
[time=2333] And it is a call to excellence. In other words, if you've been assigned to dig a ditch, dig the best ditch you can dig.
[time=2341] If you have been assigned to write a particular report, write it to the very best of your ability. Answer the phone to the best of your ability.
[time=2349] Give yourself. Throw yourself at the endeavor. Do it to the very best of your ability. Some things came to my mind as I was thinking about that.
[time=2357] Let me just list a couple of muffins. This would mean the following. If I were to be hardly involved in my work, this would mean the following.
[time=2363] Number one, I'd be on time. I'd get to work on time. All the time. Every time. Except for those rare situations where something beyond my power changed that.
[time=2375] I'd be prepared. I would set a fast pace. I would overcome obstacles. I would treat people right. I would ask questions and seek to understand the intent behind the actual policy listed.
[time=2390] I would be a team player. I would do something extra that day that I wasn't paid for. I would be early for meetings.
[time=2399] I would dress and groom myself in an exemplary way. And when it's time to go home, finally at the end of the day, when it's finally time to go home, I'd make one more call.
[time=2409] Or complete one more task. And then I'd go home. Throw yourself at it. Give yourself to it. Immerse yourself in it.
[time=2417] Open yourself up and give all that you are to the task in front of you.
[time=2426] Now, can't you just see this slave in this ancient world out in the field? And it's hot. And the work is hard as he's harvesting some particular crop.
[time=2441] And the day is long. It's from as long as the sun is up until it goes down. And they've been doing it for day after day after day because the harvesting period is very short and they have to get it while the getting is good.
[time=2455] And his body hurts. And he doesn't like the work. And he doesn't like having to do this. And there's no end in sight.
[time=2464] All he's going to do is move from harvesting this crop. And he's going to go work hard at this particular task. And then it just cycles year after year after year after year.
[time=2472] And it's going nowhere. Just a cycle of this stuff. And maybe this particular slave we have in mind is struggling with a memory of how that master treated him harshly and beat one of his children and sold another one off.
[time=2487] Maybe he had a sexual impropriety or allowed that to occur. And so there's deep fertile ground for resentment and hatred.
[time=2497] But he's born again. He's saved. He's Christian.
[time=2504] So God comes into that system and says, "Look, obey him in everything.
[time=2511] Don't even crack the door to rebellion in your life." Secondly, do it out of a choice that you make as an image bearer who has the privilege of choosing your own values.
[time=2524] And say, "I choose to obey this man or this woman because it is right in the sight of God and I will render service out of my own conviction and choice, not out of compulsion of someone else."
[time=2537] And then he says, "Thoroughly work hard." Don't just dilly-dally out there in that field. Don't just do enough to get by.
[time=2546] Throw yourself at the endeavor and work as strong and as steady with a pace that allows you to be a producer in the field of your master.
[time=2556] Man, that's what I mean. That's radical. How are you supposed to do that year after year after year after year after year after year?
[time=2567] He says, "Liss, look at the verse 23. Know this, my friend. You are working for me. You are working for me.
[time=2576] Whatever you do, do your work hardly as for the Lord rather than for men."
[time=2584] One person put it this way. In reality, people cease to be slaves as soon as they start working for the Lord. And that's true.
[time=2593] What he's saying is, "Don't you for a minute become bitter and angry at that individual and your life and the circumstances therein and think it is nothing but the product of chance.
[time=2603] Listen to me. I am in control of all the authority that is, and you're working for that master because I have providentially provided that for you that is where I have you.
[time=2613] That is your lot in life. I could change it in a heartbeat. I could move all the circumstances that are there.
[time=2618] You are not the victim of some human being or some human system you are instead under the watchful providential eye of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2628] And for those of you who are struggling with your career path right now and are struggling with your job and seeing dead ends and becoming disillusioned and thinking that this is all just a bad turn of events,
[time=2639] and why weren't you more lucky as it were? No. Don't even begin to let your mind run down that path.
[time=2647] You are working for the sovereign Lord who is intimately acquainted with all your thoughts, your desires, and the particulars of your life.
[time=2656] You are not drifting upon the sea of happenstance. He knows exactly where you are. He knows exactly what you're doing.
[time=2664] He loves you with a deep and earnest passion, and he is working all of it together for good, so work in such a way that you honor your true employer, the living Lord Jesus Christ.
[time=2675] And then you'll have dignity. Then you'll have dignity. You will be able to go to work and look your employer in the eye and say the following,
[time=2683] "I have done everything you have asked me to do to the best of my ability. I have done it from my heart, and I have given you all that I am in the task.
[time=2693] I have done it heartily." What an incredible witness in testimony and freedom. You work for the Lord.
[time=2704] The fourth principle in verses 24 and 25, you might put it this way, "Remember the reward."
[time=2710] Remember the reward. Look at verse 24, "Knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance.
[time=2717] It is the Lord Christ whom you serve, for he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done and that without partiality."
[time=2726] He's got a positive and a negative here. He's saying to the slave, "Listen, and I'm speaking literally of slaves in that day who never had an inheritance and never would have been able to have an inheritance.
[time=2736] They were themselves somebody else's inheritance. They couldn't own private property and they certainly couldn't direct what they had to another generation,
[time=2744] because everything about them, even themselves, they were all owned." And so he says, "Look, even though your earthly master may abuse you and fail to remunerate you in justifiable ways and continue to labor you and continue to wear you down and continue to work you literally until you die.
[time=2762] Until there is no more value in your body at all to him, that's okay because I, the Lord Jesus Christ says, "I will give you the reward of the inheritance."
[time=2772] It's beautiful in the original language because there's a preposition in there which indicates it's Christ who is going to personally hand that worker his reward or her reward.
[time=2781] It will come directly from the hand of Christ when all has been said and done.
[time=2787] And if you know anything about Scripture at all, you know that that reward will not be money and it will not be tangible things.
[time=2795] What is the inheritance of heaven? Christ Himself. You say, "Listen, you're working for me in two senses. You're working for me because I'm the one in charge and you're working for me because I'm what you gain.
[time=2808] You get me when it's all said and done.
[time=2812] I will personally give myself to you." It says in Psalm 73, "Whom have I in heaven but thee, and besides thee I desire nothing on earth. My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
[time=2826] The great joy and the great passion and the great excitement of heaven is to be in the very presence of the person of Jesus Christ and know his perfection and know his joy and know his holiness and know his fullness.
[time=2837] So to the slave who would never have a chance to receive anything by way of reward or inheritance, Christ says, "I will personally give it to you. I keep a record of what you do and I am building for you the reward of the inheritance which you deserve."
[time=2852] But then he adds a negative note. He says, "Listen, look at verse 24. Excuse me, 25, for he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done and that without partiality."
[time=2865] Listen, you're a slave and you think it's too hard and you think it's unjust and you think it goes on too long and you think therefore you are justified in doing wrong, you'll receive your just do.
[time=2878] You will receive the discipline of the hand of God and he will do that without partiality.
[time=2883] It means not to receive someone by face or category. He will not say, "Oh, well, okay, because you're a slave. I will discipline you as you deserve."
[time=2893] I'll make a special exception because your circumstances were so very, very hard. Nope, that's not what he's saying.
[time=2899] He's saying, "You are a slave and it is hard and here's what I call you to do and here is how I will reward you if you do it and here are the consequences you receive if you don't without partiality."
[time=2909] He's just not all that broken up over the condition of life, which again is kind of shocking.
[time=2918] He just says, "That's your lot. Now live with purpose and character and meaning in the midst of it. Honor me, glorify me. Submit your will and your life to me."
[time=2931] Well, there they are, the four principles. Number one, obey. Obey him in everything. Number two, obey him from the heart.
[time=2938] Number three, work hard. Work heartily. Give yourself totally the task. And four, look for the eternal reward because God will give it to you.
[time=2952] Look at chapter four verse one, just a brief word to the masters. And those of you who are here today, who are employers, this applies to you.
[time=2962] And we are thankful for you, creating jobs and providing opportunities and risking capital and all the things that you do to provide jobs for the rest of us.
[time=2971] Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a master in heaven.
[time=2978] It's just very simply the golden rule. Listen now, masters, don't think for a minute that you don't have one too.
[time=2985] You are as subject to the authority of the Lord as your slave is.
[time=2990] And what you want to do when you make your decisions is get in the shoes of your employee.
[time=2995] Don't make your decisions based upon common business practice, though you may be informed by it.
[time=3002] Ultimately, you need to provide justice and fairness. Do unto them as you would want them to do unto you where the circumstances reversed.
[time=3011] Get in their shoes. Walk a day in their path and say, how am I treating these people? Am I compensating them fairly? Are my demands unjust?
[time=3022] Am I asking them to do things that I wouldn't want to have to do where I am in terms of it being unjust or unfair?
[time=3030] If you apply that standard, God will give you wisdom and you will honor Him.
[time=3035] We're going to close with an application here. Let me give you two of them.
[time=3040] Number one, if you don't have this kind of attitude right now about work, and the chances are you may have come in here without the best attitude about your employment, that can happen from time to time.
[time=3053] If you have a bad attitude towards your master, your employer, let me tell you this, it's not just a problem with your master or your employer.
[time=3061] It's a problem that you have with your Lord.
[time=3064] Authority is authority, and God is the ultimate authority, and He's over the government, and He's over employment, and He's over parents, and He represents Himself through teachers and policemen, the whole nine yards, any authority in your life.
[time=3076] And if you are bucking that particular authority, you are bucking God.
[time=3081] So don't allow yourself the pseudo-comfort of saying, "I'm really okay in my relationship with God, I just have a problem with my boss," not true, false view of reality.
[time=3093] You really are at odds with the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.
[time=3098] All the more reason to rectify that, all the more reason to humble yourself, all the more reason to repent,
[time=3104] all the more reason to become simple of heart and humility before God and say, "God, I will submit to my employer because I know it is a barometer of my willingness to submit to you."
[time=3115] There's no two ways about it.
[time=3118] The second point of application.
[time=3121] I suspect there will be a lot of employers in heaven who are there because of the witness and the testimony of those they employed.
[time=3132] I believe there will be a lot of people in heaven because they had the good fortune to employ Christians, and when they watched that Christian work and do the kinds of things that they did, they had to draw the inescapable conclusion that Christ is real.
[time=3148] Now let me just read this to you. You might write it down. Titus 2, 9 and 10.
[time=3153] Titus 2 is dealing with the same subject matter, how a slave would report to his master, but it adds this nuance at the end, I want you to see it.
[time=3162] It says this.
[time=3163] Urge bond slaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well pleasing, not argumentative, not pilfering, but showing all good faith that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.
[time=3180] Let me explain that to you.
[time=3182] When you apply these principles, you adorn the doctrine of God our Savior Jesus Christ.
[time=3189] The word adorn was used in the world of making jewelry, and there would be these various pieces that would go into a valuable piece of jewelry.
[time=3200] Several different stones and various metals, and it was the job of the jeweler to arrange those precious jewels and metals in such a way that their combined sum total was more brilliant
[time=3211] and glorious than they were independently laying there on that mat.
[time=3215] That is what he is saying.
[time=3217] Take these individual truths that you have learned today and be the jeweler.
[time=3224] Build them into your life so that your employer can see the brilliance and the wonder and the splendor of the doctrine of God.
[time=3234] Get it up off this flat page.
[time=3237] Get it farther than the proclaimed voice, and you begin to arrange the wonder of God's doctrine in your life such that you become this valuable, gorgeous, brilliant piece of jewelry that adorns the doctrine of God in the view of your unsaved employer.
[time=3256] Now folks, what could be better than that?
[time=3259] Why better go to work than that?
[time=3264] I owe, I owe, it's off to work, no.
[time=3268] I hold in my life the wonder of the truth of God, and it is my privilege and my opportunity to so arrange its application in my life that I adorn the doctrine of God in the eyes of the unsaved employer and employees co and fellow workers in my life.
[time=3290] Boy, that's a reason to get up and go to work in the morning, isn't it?
[time=3293] And that destroys any notion that there are those in sacred call to ministry and then there are the rest, the peons of Christianity who just must go off into secular work.
[time=3303] No, my friend.
[time=3305] No.
[time=3307] Honor and dignity and character and purpose.
[time=3312] Let me invite you to stand as we close our service.
[time=3323] Well, as you can tell, the Word of God gives a very unique and wonderful perspective on many things in our lives, not the least of which would be our workplace involvement.
[time=3334] And maybe you're watching this today and hearing the Word of God clarifying how a person should work, the attitude they should work with, and you say to yourself, I believe that's right.
[time=3343] I mean, that certainly makes sense to me, but that's not me.
[time=3346] I'm a million miles away from that standard and I don't know that in my own power, I could ever attain it.
[time=3352] Well, you're probably right.
[time=3354] In your own power, you never will be able to attain it, nor would I, nor would anyone.
[time=3359] That's the power of the Holy Spirit that works inside of a Christian that allows them to strive after that.
[time=3365] Not that even as a Christian that would be perfectly attained, but there would be a desire and there would be a resource and there would be a strength inside of a believer to move in that direction and give honor to God.
[time=3375] As the way they handle themselves at work.
[time=3378] If you'd like to have the power of God at work in your life, if you'd like to have the power of the Holy Spirit energizing you and moving you towards that standard of excellence in the workplace, it all begins with a profession of faith in Jesus Christ where you turn your life over to him.
[time=3393] It involves confessing your sin and admitting that you failed to live up to the divine standard, not just at work, but everywhere in your life.
[time=3401] He then forgives you through Christ sends the Holy Spirit inside of you and you begin your walk with God through the power of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3409] If you'd like that for your life, you can have it right now.
[time=3412] Just bow your head and pray to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and to help you do that, I'm going to bow my head and lead you in that prayer.
[time=3422] And if you say quietly in your heart to God, what I'm saying out loud and if you mean it, God will hear you forgive you and give you Christ as your Savior.
[time=3431] Well, if you'd like to, I invite you to pray with me right now.
[time=3435] Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3438] I know that I have failed to live up to the divine standard in so many areas of my life, but I believe that the Bible teaches I can be forgiven for my sins through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3451] And I ask you to save me through Christ and his death and his resurrection.
[time=3456] I invite Christ into my heart, into my life, I give myself to him.
[time=3461] And I look forward to the power of the Holy Spirit, drawing me to live in a way that honors you in every aspect of my life.
[time=3470] Thank you for saving me, thank you for forgiving me.
[time=3474] In Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3477] Well, if you just prayed that prayer, we'd love to know about it here at the Bible Hour.
[time=3482] We have some materials we'd love to send you, so write us here and let us know.
