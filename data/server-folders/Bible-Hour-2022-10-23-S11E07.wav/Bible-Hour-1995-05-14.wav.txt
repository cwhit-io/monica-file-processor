[time=0] (upbeat music) - Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service
[time=10] of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=11] We're glad you've joined us.
[time=13] If we could pull all the mothers in the world to determine what it is they want the most, what do you think they'd say?
[time=19] Well, my guess is they'd say they want more than anything else in the world, a strong family.
[time=25] Blindfold a mother.
[time=26] Spinner around three times, but no matter how great the distraction and competing values, her heart always seems to gravitate back to the family.
[time=35] You know, the Bible tells us that the only person who wants to see a strong family more than a mother is God.
[time=41] Stay with us today as we study his word and see God's pattern for strong families.
[time=47] Right now, let's join our service.
[time=49] (upbeat music)
[time=62] [MUSIC - 240 seconds]
[time=309] Hi, my name's Russell Moore.
[time=310] I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour and thank you for joining us today.
[time=313] I'd like to speak with you today about a financial need that we have here at the Bible Hour.
[time=318] Since the very beginning of this ministry some 19 years ago, the Bible Hour has always been supported by the viewers of this ministry.
[time=327] It's never been a ministry so much to speak of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=330] It's always been supported by those who view it, people like you.
[time=334] And I'd like to ask you to consider joining the Founders Club.
[time=337] That's a special group of people who make a regular monthly commitment of $15 a month to support this ministry.
[time=344] This is a tremendous help to us.
[time=346] 95% of the people that work hard each week to bring you the Bible Hour are volunteers.
[time=351] I myself am a volunteer and receive no financial remuneration for the ministry itself.
[time=356] I'm just thankful for the chance to preach God's Word.
[time=359] We do have a very small staff and the bulk of our expenses come from buying the airtime to present the ministry to you.
[time=366] I'd like to invite you to become a member of the Founders Club.
[time=369] Again, that's making a $15 a month commitment.
[time=372] And in response for doing that, I'd like to send you a special four-part series called Marriage God's Way.
[time=379] This is a series I did not too long ago on marriage.
[time=382] I'd love to send it to you.
[time=383] You may have a loved one who could benefit from this or you and your spouse might want to listen to it and be encouraged from God's Word on His truth as how to make a strong, godly marriage.
[time=394] Well, as you know, we don't often ask for money.
[time=397] In fact, it's very, very rare, but our need is very acute.
[time=400] If you'd consider becoming a member of our Founders Club, it would be greatly appreciated.
[time=405] Now let's go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our service.
[time=435] We come together there.
[time=442] Forever there is an after me.
[time=447] Someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there.
[time=454] Love will be our home.
[time=458] Wherever there are children singing, where a tender heart is beating, we can live together there.
[time=470] As love will be our home.
[time=480] With love, our hearts can be a family.
[time=488] And hope can bring this family face to face.
[time=496] And though we may be part of our heart, our hearts can be as one.
[time=504] For love is in one place at one time.
[time=511] Wherever there is laughter ringing, someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there.
[time=524] Love will be our home.
[time=528] Wherever there is words of kindness spoken, where a vow is never broken, we can live together there.
[time=540] And love will be our home.
[time=570] Wherever there is laughter ringing, someone smiling, someone dreaming, we can live together there.
[time=590] Love will be our home.
[time=598] Wherever there are children singing, where a tender heart is beating, we can live together there.
[time=609] Love will be our home.
[time=645] Wherever there is laughter ringing, where a tender heart is beating, we can live together there.
[time=657] Love will be our home.
[time=687] Thank you, Michelle.
[time=692] Well, I want to talk to you this morning about what I believe mothers want most.
[time=699] The thing that mothers want more than anything else, in my opinion, is a strong, godly family.
[time=706] And if I could have rigged up some kind of apparatus here for this morning with a light bulb and an electrical cord and then some type of sensory device at the end of it,
[time=714] I could go through here today and touch the men and then touch the women.
[time=717] I think the place the light bulb would light the brightest if it were to indicate a desire for a strong family would be as I touch the mothers in this place.
[time=726] I think mothers have the clearest vision of what a strong family looks like.
[time=731] I think mothers tend to be most willing to make the greatest personal sacrifices to build a strong family.
[time=739] And when the family is broken and falling apart, it's mothers who I perceive are most grieved and broken-hearted over what has been lost.
[time=748] And it's mothers who usually work the hardest at picking up the pieces to put it back together.
[time=755] But mothers can make a mistake in all of this.
[time=758] They can be so committed and so desiring to have a strong family, a strong, godly family that they can begin to assume full responsibility for the same.
[time=768] They can begin to think it is totally up to them to get that job done.
[time=773] And they're aided in that wrong impression as other members of the family, the father and the children seem to want to be free to advocate that to her as well.
[time=781] And they're ready to enjoy the benefits of a strong family but not take responsibility and not play their part and not do what they're supposed to do in the building of a strong, godly family.
[time=791] This little syndrome gives breed to a monster called the Perfect Mother Monster.
[time=797] Came across this this week, it seemed appropriate.
[time=799] The Perfect Mother Monster is a totally unrealistic creation that mothers have in their own minds about how they're supposed to perform.
[time=807] And they set unrealistically high standards.
[time=810] They are aided in that by cultural expectations, images from the media like June Cleaver and their own internal standards.
[time=817] And it may be slightly different in each mother but here are a few traits of the Perfect Mother Monster.
[time=822] The Perfect Mother is always there.
[time=825] The Perfect Mother always looks great and does as does her perfectly ordered home.
[time=830] The Perfect Mother never loses her patience.
[time=833] The Perfect Mother always serves nutritious home cooked meals.
[time=838] The Perfect Mother, if she works outside the home, still does all of the above flawlessly.
[time=845] And the Perfect Mother has perfect children.
[time=849] A lot of mothers carry this monster around inside of them and it talks to them and when they can't perform up to these unrealistic expectations,
[time=857] they find themselves depressed, upset, angry, disgruntled.
[time=863] The fact is this, a strong family can only be achieved when everybody in that family is pulling their own weight.
[time=872] The only person in my mind who wants to see a strong family more than mothers is God Himself.
[time=879] God happens to be even more committed to a strong, godly family than are the mothers with us today.
[time=886] And today if you come with me to Colossians chapter 3 in our continued study of this book, we're going to find the ingredients of a strong family.
[time=895] And God has here a word, a word for the wife, a word for the husband, a word to the father and a word to the children.
[time=905] Because God knows that a strong family cannot be built by one person alone.
[time=910] It is the product of the consorted effort of everybody involved.
[time=916] It's not a comprehensive word today. In fact, these are very short verses, usually bringing only one basic command or statement or insight to each participant.
[time=926] But maybe that's as it ought to be. Maybe God would just give you one thing to think about today on Mother's Day,
[time=932] as we would try to strive with the mothers here for strong, godly families.
[time=938] There's a wonderful opportunity to prepare for this message because a couple of weeks ago, as I looked at these verses,
[time=944] I just felt led of the spirit to write a letter to about 15 women and about 15 husbands in our church, mothers and husbands.
[time=954] And I put these verses out and I just asked some basic questions about each verse and then left some space.
[time=959] And I've got a stack of responses on my desk and I had a great time reading through those today.
[time=964] So you're not only here today from God's Word on strong families.
[time=968] But we'll enrich our time together by including some of the statements that were made by some of the women and some of the men.
[time=975] I think you'll be blessed.
[time=977] Let's begin with a word to the wives. Look at verse 18.
[time=980] Wives, be subject to your husbands as is fitting in the Lord.
[time=986] It's a difficult day. It's a difficult culture in which to even raise this point because women have been so terribly abused by men in the last 30 or 40 years,
[time=996] particularly in our culture, I think throughout history, because they are stronger and because they are typically in charge,
[time=1003] they use that strength, just that raw physical strength to have their own way and to be very, very selfish in the daily affairs of life.
[time=1012] But nevertheless, in God's design, He has called wives to be subject and to submit to their husbands.
[time=1020] This word for subject does not come out of the slavery domain. It comes out of the military domain.
[time=1026] And it means to arrange yourself under in rank. It means to put yourself under the other person.
[time=1032] And I want you to envision for just a moment some very high ranking military officials.
[time=1038] One might be a five-star general. The other might just be a four-star general who's been assigned to work under his superior.
[time=1045] You can see right there that has nothing to do or to say about a person's essence or their intelligence or their experience or their ability or their value even to the operation in view.
[time=1056] It simply means that one has been placed under the other and that having been placed under the other,
[time=1062] there is a willingness and a commitment to bring all that that person is to fulfill the direction and the movement that has been set forth.
[time=1071] God knows that any time you have a group of people together and a family is nothing more than a group of people together.
[time=1077] I mean, it is more than that, but it is at least that. Somebody has to lead. Somebody has to call the shots.
[time=1084] Somebody has to give direction and God has given that responsibility to the husband.
[time=1089] When I asked some of the women in our church their understanding of what it meant for them to be subject, they told me this.
[time=1095] In a tough decision that we've talked about and prayed about, but still have different views, I think it's accepting his decision.
[time=1104] Another said this, "I defer to honor, respect him, recognizing that God has placed him over me in leadership of our home.
[time=1113] He is our covering, our provider, our protector." Another said it this way, "It does not mean a loss of dignity or respect in the relationship.
[time=1122] It does not mean a "cave man" mentality of dragging the wife around by her hair. Amen, amen."
[time=1131] One woman gave me a word picture of what she thought it meant to submit.
[time=1135] When I think of submission, I think of, and we'll call him Jim, all these husbands will be named Jim this morning.
[time=1142] I think of Jim out of love for me, holding an umbrella over me, protecting me from the many things in life.
[time=1149] Unless I submit to him, holding the umbrella over me, I get wet, or windblown, or scorched from the sun.
[time=1157] We are walking side by side because he loves me and holds the umbrella over me, and I walk under his umbrella, and we keep safe and dry and warm, and we get where we are going together and safe.
[time=1168] We both have a responsibility in this scenario.
[time=1172] That's a good word picture.
[time=1174] Husbands, let me say this to you, be the kind of man.
[time=1180] Be the kind of man and work to create the kind of atmosphere in your home that makes it a blessing to follow you.
[time=1192] In my questioning of these people, I said, "What's the hardest part of being subject to your husband?" One response came this way, "When my husband shows lack of leadership in the home, i.e. in discipline, finances, organization, spiritual needs, etc.,
[time=1206] then my tendency is to take over, and we become competitors, and I resent having to do his role."
[time=1215] The theme that I read this week over and over again is that the women of this church are more than willing to follow.
[time=1220] What they're looking for are men who are willing to lead, and lead in ways whereby the man brings the substance of his being and the strength of his character to the issues not just in the workplace, but in the home.
[time=1235] Be a leader in terms of discipline, be a leader in terms of finances, be a leader in terms of the organization of the home and the spiritual needs, and that isn't to say you have to do it all, and that isn't to say you're the best one to do it all.
[time=1247] Be interested, and be a leader, and be plugged in is the cry, I think, of a woman's heart for her husband.
[time=1255] Contrary to that, another wife wrote this, "I have a husband who is kind, loving, respectful, full of integrity, responsible, trustworthy, and has given his life for the best interest of our family.
[time=1269] How could I have trouble submitting to him? Poor Jim. He got more than he bargained for when he married me.
[time=1279] You see, when the husband is faithfully trying to lead as he ought and giving of himself in that home scenario, it gives the wife an opportunity to ask herself, honestly am I following, and maybe the problem is me, not him."
[time=1294] Another said, when he is the actual leader, underlined, actual leader, this means he discusses important family issues with me, he underlined, notices the needs around him, he acts without prodding, he values my opinion.
[time=1313] In one sense, subjection is a two-way street, and it is a huge responsibility on the part of the husband to be the kind of leader that makes following a reality, makes following possible, and hopefully makes following of the light.
[time=1329] But I want to add this, based upon the authority of God's word, ladies, regardless of your husband's performance as a leader in your home, whether it's easy or hard to follow him, work at being a submissive wife.
[time=1343] Work at make it a goal, make it a priority, make it something you pride yourself in, make it something you value yourself by.
[time=1353] As I read through these various sheets, I was struck by four different pieces of advice. I asked for advice on how to be a submissive wife, what have been things that have helped you, and four things came through real loud and clear.
[time=1367] The women of this church, say to the women of this church, study the word of God and take your responsibility for your behavior as a submissive wife.
[time=1378] The words were these, "Get rid of," quote, "I will submit when."
[time=1384] Throw out of your vocabulary this notion, "I will honor him when."
[time=1390] In other words, remove the conditional element from your heart and from your mind as you study God's word and realize God's unconditional call to you as women to submit and follow your husbands.
[time=1401] Barring, of course, they ask you to do something outside of God's will, or his word, rather I should say, outside the moral boundaries, right and wrong.
[time=1410] Secondly, pray specifically for your husband. You want to be a better wife, pray regularly and faithfully and specifically for your husband, and one added pray that he gets in God's word because when he's in God's word, he is most teachable.
[time=1426] Three, surround yourself with godly women who model this principle in their marriage. This came through over and over and over again.
[time=1433] If you are struggling with submission, their advice, my advice, get around people, even God's word, as he teaches the older women to teach the younger women, get around women who are doing this.
[time=1445] One that he wrote, "Have a teachable heart. I'm always looking and listening for new ways to honor my husband. It's contagious."
[time=1454] In other words, huddle up with the women who do this and look at their life and listen to their reasoning and try to find a momentum for this in your own life that becomes its own energy.
[time=1468] Fourthly, keep in mind that when you honor your husband, whether he deserves it or not, you're honoring God and you are being obedient to him and obedience to God isn't based on feelings.
[time=1482] In a sense, take his face out of the picture and put God's face in the picture and know that by honoring your husband, the real one you honor who is worthy in every situation of obedience and honor is God, though your husband may not be worthy of honor in every case.
[time=1501] That's good counsel, that's good wisdom. Now a word to husbands, strong families are built when husbands do what verse 19 says to do.
[time=1512] Husbands, be subject, husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them. Husbands, love your wives.
[time=1526] If you've been around the New Testament very long at all, you know that love is not an emotion and it doesn't just describe sexual behavior, it is preeminently an attitude of sacrificing yourself for someone else.
[time=1541] Christ is the image and the picture of how a man is to love his wife and so Christ gave himself completely and totally, even in death, that he might present the bride of Christ pure and holy and blameless.
[time=1554] That's the standard, that's the one we model. That's the kind of sacrificial love we're supposed to be about. Pursue her for her best interest.
[time=1565] Your wife is not one of the tools you have to try to have a nice day. Let me explain this to you, what I mean by this and this kind of just comes out of my own life.
[time=1576] But I find myself at the beginning of a day while I'm still laying in bed there trying to get going, that a common phrase, the wrong phrase, commonly comes into my mind and I begin to look at my day through the wrong grid and it is this one. How can I have a good day?
[time=1595] Because I'm a Christian, it doesn't mean run off into sin. How can I have a morally nice good day? And what I mean by that is how can I, at the end of this day, put my head back on this pillow and feel like I had a good day?
[time=1608] And as a scenario might go, well the one I waste a day, so I'll get up and I'll do the lawn and then we'll go into a so-and-so's game because that'll be really fun and we'll watch her participate.
[time=1618] Then I'll drop by the office for a couple of hours because there are some undone things there. If I tie them up this weekend then I know I'm off for a great week and that'll give me kind of an energy and kind of a boost.
[time=1627] Oh and then don't forget now the paces are on so I want to get home and catch those. And then if we could just have a really nice dinner then I could get back involved in either reading a book or maybe watch a movie of some kind.
[time=1640] Now my wife, you see, somewhere is supposed to fit in this day and she will be a good wife if she doesn't get in the way of that process. In fact if she can contribute to that process.
[time=1652] In fact the more she helps in that process the better off I am and the better wife she is. Now my friends that is a long, long way from verse 19, husbands love your wives.
[time=1666] And we say to her I love my wife, I provided this house, I provided the car, there's food there and you know, I mean we're even going to take her to lunch for Mother's Day.
[time=1675] I love my wife, what do you mean I don't love my wife, try this one, try getting up, rather before you get up, try laying awake on that pillow and asking a completely different set of questions.
[time=1687] And not just on Saturday or Sunday but every day.
[time=1690] See I wonder how this woman laying next to me is doing today, she's still sleeping but I wonder what she would be thinking if she were awake.
[time=1700] What are the pressures that she's facing, what are the hurts that she's carrying, what are the disappointments that she's got to deal with today and what do you think her nice day would look like.
[time=1712] And if she were to outline a nice day, what would that look like for her, start with those kinds of questions and begin to give yourself to respond to those kinds of needs.
[time=1724] I don't know how else to interpret the verse, I don't know how else to interpret the verse other than that kind of practical implementation.
[time=1731] That doesn't mean you don't go to work and that doesn't mean that you don't get the long cut and that doesn't mean that you don't go to your child's game.
[time=1738] You don't get the energy and there's a thought and there's a way and there's a perspective and there's a desire that somehow she is central to that process that she has cherished and honored and loved.
[time=1754] What I heard over and over from the ladies of our church on this topic of, I kind of said, you know what do they do when they really love you?
[time=1761] What are a couple of things that we occasionally do right?
[time=1765] And they said this over and over again, discuss things with her, your job, your children, your discipline, the finances, make her feel like her opinion is valued, do not always play the devil's advocate.
[time=1778] Another one said, practice tenderness, ask how she's doing, what is important to her, listen to her, value her as a child of God, treasure her as your help made and partner.
[time=1790] I think I've mentioned this from the pulpit before, but one of the most shocking and embarrassing statements I husband can ever make in his life is to say, boy, I don't understand my wife.
[time=1800] And they kind of say it with a sarcasm like, and by the way, she's impossible to understand.
[time=1806] And that it's kind of a macho thing that we don't understand her.
[time=1810] As if to say in a quiet way, because she's so peculiar, non-understood, that is an embarrassing remark.
[time=1819] That is a remark that reveals that this particular man has completely lost his bearings in God's word.
[time=1828] Because the word of God calls you first to lead her, and secondly to love her, and then says you must understand her to do either of those.
[time=1838] We show an energy, and a zeal, and an ability to comprehend, and break into new fields of learning, whether it be in building, or computer, or medicine, or law, and man, there is no intellectual mountain that is too high.
[time=1853] There is no challenge that is too great for us to penetrate, and we will understand, and we will conquer a complete comprehensive knowledge of that subject matter or dynamic or principle as it relates to whatever we're doing.
[time=1867] But somehow, and even under the direct injunction of the word of God, we feel very smug and comfortable being able to say, "I don't understand my wife."
[time=1880] And the sarcasm, and the demeaning attitude that sometimes comes with that comment, understand your wife, make it the most important thing you would ever want to know.
[time=1892] Another woman said, "Show you care by non-judgmental listening. Don't step in to solve the issue. Just listen, and try to rephrase it back to me so I know you really heard me."
[time=1907] You know, there's just this thing, man. There's a part of them. They long to be understood. Not only does God tell us to understand them, but there is this reflective part in them that is saying, "Would you please just listen and take the time to hear and give me indications that you weren't thinking about something else while I was talking to you?"
[time=1931] There's the second thing in verse 19, "And do not be embittered against them. Husbands do not be embittered against--" this word means to be sharp.
[time=1941] It means to be harsh. It means to be bitter. And it is a bold prohibition. Do not. Whatever you do.
[time=1950] Now, think of all the things you could have said not to do. Think of all the ways you could have finished that verse.
[time=1955] Do not blah, blah, blah, blah. Think of all the options, but he chose, "Do not be embittered against them."
[time=1964] As I asked some of our ladies, "What does it feel like when your husband is harsh? What does it feel like when he is embittered against you?"
[time=1976] As you read, as you listen to their answers, I think you will see again the wisdom of God in picking this one.
[time=1984] One said, "Whenever we had a discussion, I was the one who always felt guilty and made to feel as if I had just been scolded by my dad."
[time=1997] Harsh, painful words were spoken that caused a large gap to grow between us. We would start out reasonable, but it always turned out painful.
[time=2008] If he had done something to upset me, I'd say so, but then he'd start in on me again and I'm guilty.
[time=2016] Or then we'd find the reach in impasse and he'd say, "Okay, you're perfect and I'm not." And that was the end of the conversation.
[time=2026] Another one said, "It makes me feel like a failure. It makes me feel very angry and resentful and vindictive."
[time=2033] Another said, "It makes me feel crushed. Like someone picked a flower, crushed it with no feeling of compassion and flung the petals on the ground to be stepped on, some buried and some blown away by the wind, never to be recovered."
[time=2045] I felt like an inanimate object valued only if I met the requirement or the need at that time.
[time=2053] Another one, "It makes me feel like just turning inward and not loving him the way I'm supposed to do."
[time=2061] Another one, "I feel totally unworthy of anything when my husband and I have had harsh words and disagreement."
[time=2071] Another one, "Unkind words crush my spirit. They shut down communication and build a wall. The lingering effects can last for days if it is not dealt with."
[time=2082] I can't believe the devastation and the wreckage that words, whether they're untimely and sensitive, accusatory, vindictive, sarcastic cause in my heart.
[time=2093] The last one, "It makes me feel totally worthless and undesirable."
[time=2100] Do you know what it feels like to feel worthless and undesirable? It feels like a living hell.
[time=2109] That's why James wrote about the tongue, "Behold, how great a forest is set a flame by such a small fire."
[time=2116] And the tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life and is set on fire by hell.
[time=2129] Boy, you know, Lord is saying to us today as men, "Do not be embittered against your wife. Do not be harsh. Do not express harshness, but more than that, don't even feel it inside."
[time=2140] Whatever you've got to do to grant forgiveness and whatever you've got to reorientate to grant the loving sacrificial commitment that's got to be there, give it because when you are, it's devastating.
[time=2150] It is absolutely devastating.
[time=2154] Harsh words, harsh tones, raised voices, angry feelings, expressed feelings are out of bounds.
[time=2166] They do incredible damage.
[time=2172] Well, what does it say to the kids?
[time=2175] Now, here's a nice verse. Here's a verse that ought to be smattered all over the more household.
[time=2181] Verse 20, "Children, be obedient to your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord. Be obedient to your parents."
[time=2195] I hear the cry of the Old Testament, particularly the Proverbs, "Here, my son, your father's instruction, and do not forsake your mother's teaching.
[time=2204] My son, if you receive my sayings and treasure my commandments within you, my son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments."
[time=2216] And then it goes on to list all the blessings and all the benefits and all the multiplied growth opportunities that occur in a child's life if they will but hear their father and heed the instruction of their mother.
[time=2232] I can think back on my life, and you know I didn't get saved until I was 20.
[time=2238] And if you know my testimony, you know I was involved in unbelievably sinful and damaging behavior.
[time=2244] And I can stand here today and tell you that I would not have been in it, not one bit of that trouble if I would have just obeyed my parents.
[time=2253] I might never have heard the word of God. I might never have known the concept of moral absolutes.
[time=2259] I might never have been able to benefit from the reading of this particular book, God's Inspired Word, if I had just had their instruction and followed it, I would never have gotten in any trouble.
[time=2272] But because I didn't, because I broke their commandments, my life nearly came to ruling.
[time=2281] Now the kids so much aren't here this morning, let me talk to the dynamic of obedience of children in the home.
[time=2287] I want you to know that that is the primary responsibility of the father.
[time=2293] The father is the one who is ultimately responsible for the obedience of the children in the home.
[time=2301] One of the things that I am concerned with, one of the things that breaks my heart, is when I go into a person's home,
[time=2309] and I see that there is a problem between the child and the mother, and the father kind of backs away and pretends for a moment that that is an issue just between the two of them.
[time=2319] Maybe for the moment it is, and maybe judgment would say we'll wait on this one, but the ultimate responsibility and accountability for obedience in the home rest squarely on the husband's shoulders.
[time=2331] The mother executes, the mother dispenses, the mother is a part of the process, but the final bedrock of strength is in the husband.
[time=2344] Not too long ago I was in a home where, and it wasn't in our city, where there were two teenage boys, and the teenage boys were speaking sarcastically to their mother.
[time=2354] They were disobeying their mother, they were dishonoring their mother, and what abhorred me most wasn't just that as much as my heart broke for that woman.
[time=2365] It was the fact that the husband was there and saw it.
[time=2370] And in my opinion that husband should have stepped into that situation, took both of those boys by the scruff of their neck, took them out in the backyard somewhere and said look boys, you are dealing with my most precious possession, my wife.
[time=2386] And your treatment of her like that just ended, that chapter is closed, and if I ever see it open again, you're dealing not with her, you're dealing with me.
[time=2398] Now you see that is the man's responsibility.
[time=2402] You cannot step aside, you cannot pretend that she's okay on her own in that dominion.
[time=2410] You must protect and guard and cherish her, and that starts with the way you let your children talk to her.
[time=2419] You would never let a stranger do that to your wife.
[time=2422] He would never let some other man come up to you and speak sarcastically to her like that. Don't let your kids.
[time=2428] Now verse 21 gives the balance of that.
[time=2431] That kind of strength must be balanced in such a way that you do not exasperate your children, that they may not lose heart.
[time=2439] The word "exasperate" means to provoke or to irritate.
[time=2442] Fathers who are primarily responsible for the discipline and the rearing of these children do not provoke or irritate them to the place that they as the text says lose heart.
[time=2453] To lose heart means to lose your courage or your spirit.
[time=2457] It means to break something inside of them so that they kind of list less moody, stolen frame of mind execute their duties in the home.
[time=2467] Not because they happen to be an adolescent and can be listless and moody and stolen on their own, but that way because of what you have done.
[time=2474] Your impact in their life has created that.
[time=2479] I'm not saying that always happens. I'm saying that a father can treat his children in such a way that he breaks their spirit and they lose heart.
[time=2487] That is not your job. That is not within your spirit.
[time=2491] You must stand for the strength of that home and the order of that home, but you must do it in a loving, caring, sensitive way whereby your child is not provoked to the point of losing heart.
[time=2502] Let me give you eight ways to exasperate your child, fathers.
[time=2506] Here are eight surefire ways to push your kid over the edge.
[time=2510] Number one, over protection.
[time=2513] Over protection. No trust. All rules is what I mean by that.
[time=2518] They never get the sense that they are trusted. They never get the sense that what they are can be trusted in the course of life.
[time=2525] And you are constantly having to fence them in with rules.
[time=2529] Number two, favoritism.
[time=2532] Favoritism. It's very hard for a child to never be an individual who can be the apple of your eye.
[time=2540] If you have more than one child, we should be able to separate your children into sound booth type rooms and ask them, "Who's the favorite child in the family?"
[time=2552] And each one of them should, hopefully, independently say, "I am. I am."
[time=2558] Somehow, someway, you must look long enough and look deep enough and look often enough into that heart and to that life and that individual soul and give them a sense of your pleasure.
[time=2569] To the degree that they would come out of the exercise saying, "I am clearly his favorite."
[time=2578] Now, that's tough.
[time=2582] But if you want to see the devastating results of anything other than that, read the book of Genesis and find out what favoritism did in the life of Joseph and his brothers.
[time=2592] Number three, discouragement.
[time=2595] You can exacerbate your child through discouragement.
[time=2598] Just always leave them with this impression, "No matter how good I do, it's never good enough." Hey, great game, but you could have.
[time=2607] Why didn't you... I mean, the opportunity was... Oh, there's a great report card, but you know you can do better than that.
[time=2616] That's a great job on the lawn, but you missed here and here and here.
[time=2619] Now, there's a place for corrective and instructive criticism or instruction.
[time=2624] And there is a place to let a child know that they are underachieving.
[time=2627] But if that is the mainstay of their diet, if you are constantly in the mode of giving them the impression that what they have done is not good enough, you will exasperate them.
[time=2640] You will push them over the edge.
[time=2642] They need to know that what they have done has delighted you.
[time=2647] Just like you want that from God the Father.
[time=2649] He loves you because of Christ, right?
[time=2652] He loves you through Christ and nothing you or I could ever do would ever separate is from the love of God.
[time=2656] And that's a wonderful part of being loved by God.
[time=2658] But I also want to feel the part of his pleasure when I've done something and he says, "Well done."
[time=2666] And he sends his spirit in a unique way to say to me, "Man, I'm proud of what you're doing, the path you have taken.
[time=2672] It's enough. It's satisfactory." Just as much as you want that from your Heavenly Father, your child wants it from you.
[time=2680] Number four, lack of physical contact.
[time=2683] Man, we got to be doing the hug thing and the squeeze thing and the punch thing and the kiss thing and the rough housing thing.
[time=2690] Do all of that you can while they're young because then they get a little older and they want to back away from that and then do all you can even then to get past that.
[time=2699] Break through their repulsion of you and love them physically.
[time=2705] Five, you can push a kid over the edge with a lack of a standard.
[time=2710] Children need the security of parental boundaries. Children are not old enough or smart enough.
[time=2715] It's not designed for them to make their own boundaries but people without boundaries feel insecure.
[time=2721] Six, criticism. Criticism. Just criticize them all the time. Criticize them most of the time.
[time=2729] Be in the habit of pointing out what they do wrong. Be in the habit of pointing out what they didn't do right.
[time=2735] You'll push your kid right over the edge. Children who are trained in criticism don't learn responsibility.
[time=2742] They only learn to condemn themselves. People who are raised on criticism don't learn responsibility.
[time=2749] They only learn to condemn themselves, find fault with others, doubt their own judgment, distrust everyone and live with the continual expectation of impending doom.
[time=2758] Criticize them in your demeanor. Criticize them with your words. Criticize them as a person and that's what you'll produce.
[time=2765] Number seven, neglect. Just always be too busy. Just always be almost done with this one last thing and then I'll have the time.
[time=2775] Just always come home pooped and feeling the need for personal rejuvenation so you have nothing to give to them.
[time=2783] Those of you who are sitting here saying you know it's been a long time since I've invested in my kids and I just got to get past this one next hurdle and then I'll make that investment.
[time=2790] Let me say to you that's probably the first sign that you are a workaholic and the fact of the matter is you'll probably produce another equally significant crisis that will take your time away from the kids as soon as you're done with the present one.
[time=2803] Neglect your child and push them over the edge. Eight, abuse. Yeah, hurt them physically, bruise them, punch them, slap them, break a bone, throw them on the ground, kick them, abuse them physically or abuse them verbally, scream at them, yell at them, get an angry look in your eye and just rip them up one side and down the next.
[time=2832] Do you realize that you as a father and me as a father, you know we're supposed to be, we are supposed to be the source of unconditional love that teaches them the character of God who both knows how to correct and yet does that in a frame of love and acceptance where abuse would never even enter into the picture.
[time=2855] If you find yourself in any one or several of those, repent, change for the sake of your kids and for the sake of a strong home and for the sake of your wife.
[time=2866] Well let's look at it then. Ladies please feel relieved this morning. You are not the sole person responsible for a strong godly home, you have a part to play and it's a vital one.
[time=2877] Be on the team with your husband in verse 18 and follow his leadership as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, play your part, love sacrificially your wives and do not be embittered against them and children add to this scenario your own heartfelt obedience in all things.
[time=2896] And fathers, stand for the truth, be the bedrock of strength in that home but do it in a way that you do not exasperate your children so that they do not lose heart.
[time=2909] You know I'll tell you what, I didn't come from a perfect home and neither did you and I didn't have a perfect mother and neither did you but I'm sure thankful for the one I had.
[time=2921] I want to share with you my Mother's Day card, should come up on the wall here in a minute, it says this, mom, you've always told me the importance of saying what's on my mind and not holding anything back.
[time=2934] So I feel you should know, you're pretty lucky to have me.
[time=2940] There, I feel better now, happy Mother's Day, love us.
[time=2947] Now I'll tell you what you can't see, here's what I wrote.
[time=2951] I sat back in my chair this week and I tried to remember Russell, what is the earliest memory you have of your mother?
[time=2957] And as you go back as far as you can in this week memory that God has given you, how far does it go?
[time=2963] For me I was a young, young little guy, I want to say maybe first grade, maybe I was still kind of in kindergarten.
[time=2970] I was a teeny little guy and we just got new carpeting all through the whole house and one of those big new king size beds, just one of those were coming out.
[time=2980] Well my size and that king size pillow were perfect, we were the same size.
[time=2985] So I grabbed a hole with that pillow and got in the den where there was good traction on that new carpet and ran as fast as I could towards the entryway hall which was hardwoods.
[time=2994] And leaped off the carpet, flew through the air, landed on my pillow and slid all the way to the other room.
[time=3000] I did this over and over and over and over again until like the fifth time I missed my pillow and landed chin first on the hardwoods.
[time=3010] Now my mom was in the entire other side of the house, I think she was doing something back there in her bedroom.
[time=3016] I did have the thought to at least try to cup the blood that was coming in volumes out of my little chin but then proceeded to run all the way through the living room and the other den and back through the hall and all the way back into her bedroom.
[time=3030] All this wonderful blood all over the carpet.
[time=3034] Do you realize I cannot remember ever her displeasure or her scolding over my ruining her new carpet?
[time=3042] All I can remember is her scooping me up throwing a wet something on my chin and taking me to get my stitches.
[time=3049] The memory of her displeasure, I can't find it, I don't think it was there, I don't think it ever bothered her.
[time=3056] I mean that she showed me.
[time=3059] Then I said this, I remember you taking the time to drive me down to Charles Music Store for my music lessons.
[time=3066] And now that we have five kids, we know what it means to be scattered to the forends of the earth trying to take them to and fro.
[time=3073] She faithfully did that, has nothing to show for it because I can't play anything to this day.
[time=3079] I remember you taking the time to drive us all the way to Long Beach to private school.
[time=3087] It was about a 45 minute commute and much of that was in bumper to bumper California traffic because they were concerned about our education coming from public schools
[time=3095] and wanted us to have a private Christian education.
[time=3098] And then I also said, and I remember the way you set me up with that binder and those cool page tabs.
[time=3103] My first day there in third grade when she took us to that new private school, I thought she went home, but then at recess I looked and there was the family car and there was my mom inside the family car.
[time=3112] She had found out all the classes that I had and gone to the store and bought one of those cool blue three ring binders,
[time=3118] stuffed a full of paper and the tabs and had written them out really, it was the best binder I ever had.
[time=3123] And then I said, I remember the absolute hysteria of your laughter at getting stuck on the curb with Carrie Griffin on one of our Suzuki motorcycles.
[time=3134] She had been going across the road and was going to go out into this field and she was riding double with one of our friends and the motorcycle got high ended on the curb and it couldn't do anything and I just remember the hysteria of her laughter.
[time=3146] And what an enriching experience that was that she was willing to take those kinds of risks and be that kind of person.
[time=3152] Then I said for joining in all the stuff and not being overly protective of me, so I could do that kind of crazy stuff too.
[time=3159] I was driving my own motorcycle by the time I was in the third grade, broke every bone in my right foot on the motorcycle when I was a senior in high school.
[time=3167] Thanks for the freedom. Okay, next point.
[time=3169] The things I remember, the endless flow, this is big, the endless flow of steak dinners for the more mob and company every weekend.
[time=3180] I had three older sisters and they had a way of attracting a mob.
[time=3184] Boys came from everywhere and my dad loved it so.
[time=3188] We would play all kinds of games and just be just gone all weekend long and we would come back periodically to the house and what was always there was another huge meal.
[time=3196] I think my mother spent most of my weekends either going to, coming from the store and preparing food and then cleaning it up.
[time=3206] I remember the shopping trips at the beginning of each school year where you always talked to yourself into spending just a little bit more than you should on my clothing.
[time=3216] It always made me feel loved and I don't know if she really did, maybe she stayed within the budget, maybe she was just clever enough to make me think she did.
[time=3223] But it sure made me feel loved.
[time=3226] I remember the long drives to Los Angeles to get my feet fixed.
[time=3230] So two and a half hour drive every two weeks because I had to form feet and I had to have them operate when I was in high school and had to do that for three months over and over and over again.
[time=3238] She just did it and did it and did it and did it and I never, it never dawned on me once that it wasn't like the most favorite thing in her day.
[time=3243] Like that was a huge, hardly wait, drive to LA.
[time=3247] Unbelievable.
[time=3250] Thanks, I remember the long days you spent working at USC so I could get my education paid for.
[time=3255] We didn't have enough money at that time in my life to pay for this education at USC so my mom got a job there, got tuition reduction and worked.
[time=3263] Then I said, I remember the long hours you spent editing and typing my papers so I could get through USC.
[time=3269] I didn't learn how to type but like six years ago.
[time=3272] All of my undergraduate papers in business school and all of my masters of divinity papers were edited and typed by my mom.
[time=3279] I'm the only reason I can stand, she's the only reason I can stand up here today.
[time=3283] Then I said, the way you love cherished and loved and cherished your mom and dad all the days of their life.
[time=3289] Boy, I was really enriched by her love for her mom and dad and the honor and the respect and the adoration she gave them and they weren't perfect either.
[time=3297] Especially the tenor moments just after they're passing.
[time=3300] By God's providence, my mom and I were together at one incident when her mother died and then years later when her father died and we just shared those special times.
[time=3308] The day you took us to Disneyland for my birthday.
[time=3312] The day you brought us the new Toyota minivan.
[time=3316] Heidi and I had been married, we were broke, had three kids driving around the middle of LA in a car with no air conditioning and not enough room for five people.
[time=3323] And all of a sudden my mom had had to show up with this brand new car.
[time=3326] Say here, here's a minivan, you need this, take this.
[time=3329] The day you threw the end all seminary graduation party, I think it was as much for her as for me, we were finally done typing papers.
[time=3337] This huge party, huge party, all of her friends, all of my dad's friends, all of my friends, all the food you could eat.
[time=3346] Then I said, I remember the day you, dot dot dot, I could go on and on and on.
[time=3352] You're the greatest.
[time=3355] Thanks for the kind of life that I look back on with joy and happiness and love, Russell.
[time=3362] Listen moms, we appreciate you.
[time=3366] I know that your kids could come up here and list this stuff off.
[time=3370] And I know it makes as big a difference in their life as it has in mind.
[time=3374] And we just want to honor you, you're not perfect.
[time=3377] There is no such thing as a perfect mom, stop trying, just be you.
[time=3382] And allow us and help us and pray for us to play our role in this thing called a family.
[time=3388] But know we love you and we're thankful for you.
[time=3391] Let's pray together.
[time=3396] Well, we're talking about the dynamics of a strong family and how each person has a part to play in making the family strong.
[time=3414] If anything, I may have left out the most important person in the ingredients of a strong family, and that's the person of Jesus Christ,
[time=3422] who comes into a family first individually in each person's heart as the mom and as the dad and as the children make a decision to accept Christ as their personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3432] Maybe you have never done that and you want a strong family.
[time=3435] The first step is to accept Christ and your heart is Lord and Savior.
[time=3439] I'm going to pray in a minute inviting you to follow along.
[time=3442] If you say in your heart what I'm saying out loud, and if you mean it, God will hear you and forgive you in Jesus Christ.
[time=3449] I invite you to pray with me at this time.
[time=3451] Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3454] I know that I need to be forgiven through Jesus Christ.
[time=3457] And I want a strong, godly family.
[time=3460] And my first step in that is to accept Christ as my personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3465] I ask Him to come into my heart and into my life right now.
[time=3468] I give my life to Jesus Christ to be my Savior and pray these things in His name, amen.
[time=3475] Well, if you just prayed that prayer, you've just become a Christian and we'd love to hear about that decision.
