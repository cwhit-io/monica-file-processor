[time=0] The question I want to pose to you this morning is this, what is the possibility that you
[time=10] may be believing a falsehood or a lie in the spiritual dimension, not the physical realm,
[time=17] the shape of the earth, but the spiritual realm?
[time=23] What are the possibilities that you are believing a falsehood or a lie in the spiritual dimension,
[time=29] which is universally accepted in our day and age as conventional wisdom, and if you were to question it you would be considered a fool.
[time=42] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=46] We are delighted you have joined us.
[time=48] Today's service is another in a series of outreach services.
[time=52] Today's theme is freedom.
[time=54] Right now, let's begin with music.
[time=71] You know there's some part of me that runs straight on.
[time=77] The other one's running for cover, I try to keep the getaway thoughts at bay with one
[time=86] thing or another, it's like a dance of make believe that keeps me from facing the reality
[time=95] of change, cause I like things to stay the same, but I can't straighten through.
[time=119] You know there's some times I hide my heart away and other times just tell me it over
[time=137] and it over and in this circle and I'm afraid, cause it's heart's growing colder, colder
[time=147] just falling for a fairy tale illusion, the promises that never leave me home.
[time=155] Leave me feeling so alone, let's not come, break it through, shine and light your time,
[time=174] finally I'm finding the one love that is true, feel you light around you, firing us around you, reaching out to show me you're not a great fish, show me, I'm strong enough to make it, you're the only one that can stay, oh how I need you so, guardian of all my
[time=195] life, don't ever let me go, hold it on to you, nothing can take me away, the comes breaking
[time=215] through, shine and light your time, finally I'm finding the one love that is true, feel
[time=225] you light around me, firing us around you, love comes breaking through, shine and light
[time=235] your time, finally I'm finding the one love that is true, feel you light around me, firing
[time=245] us around you, reaching out to know you're not a great fish, show me you're not a great
[time=257] fish, show me you're not a great fish, show me you're not a great fish, show me you're
[time=257] [REPETITIVE CONTENT - 313 seconds] fish, show me you're not a great fish, show me you're not a great fish, show me you're...
[time=597] Well, whatever it is that might be plaguing you, God's word holds out hope.
[time=604] They just drop it TJ. I don't have the energy to answer my door today.
[time=614] Mr. Rayburn.
[time=615] Wharton? What did TJ give you to the magazines to deliver today?
[time=621] No, but I've got some news for you.
[time=625] News?
[time=626] From the governor.
[time=627] Well, yeah.
[time=628] Well, I don't care to hear about him refusing to hear my appeal again, I'd rather have my magazines. Hey TJ!
[time=634] I think you're going to want to hear this news, Joe.
[time=637] The governor has granted you clemency.
[time=641] What?
[time=642] As of noon today, you're a free man.
[time=647] Yeah. Yeah, right, Wharton.
[time=650] What's the trick? What's the joke? It's not very funny.
[time=653] No joke, Joe. Check it out for yourself.
[time=656] Straight from the governor's desk.
[time=658] What?
[time=659] Read it for yourself.
[time=666] But why now? After 14 years?
[time=670] Only the governor can tell you that.
[time=673] I guess he never forgot your case.
[time=676] We've notified your sister, she's catching the afternoon flight.
[time=679] She'll be in here this evening.
[time=682] Oh.
[time=684] What are you doing?
[time=685] I see no reason to keep this locked until noon.
[time=689] You're a free man, Joe.
[time=692] I'll finish up the paperwork just as soon as I can.
[time=696] Congratulations.
[time=702] And that clemency has been granted to Mr.
[time=712] Joseph W. Rayburn.
[time=715] I'm free.
[time=717] Just like that, and I'm free.
[time=722] Whoo-hoo!
[time=724] Hey, TJ. TJ.
[time=727] I'm free.
[time=729] [MUSIC] A way out there they got a name [MUSIC] For wind and fire only [MUSIC] When you're lost and all [MUSIC]
[time=995] [MUSIC - 32 seconds]
[time=1188] You've got to let somebody love you before it's too late.
[time=1200] [MUSIC - 44 seconds]
[time=1252] About 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ uttered a statement that has been proven true over time.
[time=1258] He said this, "You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free." All throughout history, men and women have been held captive because they didn't know the truth.
[time=1273] Think of one of many examples that could be given this morning probably the most obvious.
[time=1279] A falsehood that held all of humanity captive on their own shores.
[time=1284] There was a statement that was made and a statement that was believed among the most learned and among the most uneducated.
[time=1292] It was just kind of a common axiom of the day, and it was this.
[time=1296] The world is flat.
[time=1300] Everybody believed it. Everybody thought it was factual.
[time=1304] Everybody thought it was true, and rarely did anybody question it.
[time=1309] They had a desire in that day and age to explore beyond the horizon.
[time=1314] They had the technology to do the same.
[time=1317] They had the resources to do the same, but conventional wisdom told them that the world was flat.
[time=1323] And there were a whole bunch of other fabrications and falsehoods that went along with that first one, the world is flat, that reinforced the captivity they found themselves in.
[time=1335] Some said if you go too close to the edge of the world, you surely fall off.
[time=1340] Others intensified it and said that the closer you get to the edge of the world, there's a force that sucks you over the edge and try as you might.
[time=1349] You won't be able to prevent your ultimate doom.
[time=1352] Others said there were huge sea monsters that lived out there on the edge, and if you got too close, they took you over the edge and you fell off into absolute oblivion.
[time=1364] There was a whole system of falsehoods and non-trues that held the world at that time captive to their own shores.
[time=1373] That's always the way it is and has been with falsehoods.
[time=1377] Let me give you three salient features throughout history that mark the big lies or the falsehoods that hold people captive.
[time=1385] Number one, they are always accepted almost universally as conventional wisdom,
[time=1392] and those who question them are considered fools.
[time=1396] Throughout history, those brave souls that have been willing to question the conventional wisdom have been first seen as fools.
[time=1405] Secondly, these falsehoods are believed despite an avalanche of evidence to the contrary.
[time=1414] It seems as if, once the popular opinion begins to move in a general direction, it doesn't matter how much evidence says that's not true.
[time=1422] They still won't see clearly the evidence.
[time=1426] And thirdly, until the falsehood is challenged, it holds its captives in a prison far more secure than any made of brick and mortar and steel.
[time=1439] It does me, but doesn't it make you wonder?
[time=1442] What are the lies?
[time=1445] What are the falsehoods that hold us captive?
[time=1450] We can look back now and see with relative ease the avalanche of evidence that points to the fact that the world is not truly flat.
[time=1461] What are the things that the next generation or the generation after that will look back at ours and say, my lands, they were held captive
[time=1471] because they didn't really know the truth?
[time=1477] What are the things that we are accepting as conventional wisdom?
[time=1481] Which, if we were to question, we would be considered fools?
[time=1485] What are the things that we accept as true despite an avalanche of evidence that's all around us but we just don't seem to get the point?
[time=1496] What is it that holds you or me captive because we have never personally challenged that conventional wisdom?
[time=1504] The question I have for you this morning is what if you are believing a falsehood or a lie, not in the physical realm, not the shape of the world or some law of chemistry that we now think to be true?
[time=1516] What if you are believing a falsehood or a lie in the spiritual dimension?
[time=1522] That is accepted as conventional wisdom, but one to which you begin to see a lot of evidence against but you are nevertheless at this point held captive and it is preventing you from experiencing a relationship with God.
[time=1540] Let me give you what I think may be one of the greatest falsehoods in the spiritual dimension that holds more people than any other captive and separated from God.
[time=1552] It's this basic axiom, man is basically good and does not need a savior. That's a pretty well accepted truism in our day and in our culture.
[time=1568] That man is basically good and doesn't need a savior. Man is intrinsically good, though he may stumble from time to time, and though there are to be sure a few notable exceptions to the rule, like Hitler or Saddam Hussein, conventional wisdom tells us that we are basically good, we are basically born good and intrinsically good. In fact we are even told that we are getting better, that there is an evolutionary process going on inside societally and man over time is in a sense pulling himself up by his own bootstraps finding higher levels of morality and higher levels of social graces over time. That we are less barbaric with the passing of each day, each century, each millennium. That's conventional wisdom. Man is basically good and doesn't need a savior. And you or I would be considered fools to question that.
[time=1628] Imagine if you were applying for a job at a university as a professor in the humanities and you were well credentialed and qualified with a PhD and you were in your interviewing process with the committee at that particular university and they were beginning to ask you questions about man and the origin of man and the condition of man and you were just a flat out say I believe that man is basically sinful, basically bad and in desperate need of help to break that condition. Can you imagine?
[time=1660] All that learning they would say gone to waste, all that education, all that money, a PhD and you'll never teach here. You're a fool. Everybody knows that's not true.
[time=1676] Imagine if you were trying to run for political office to become a congressman or a senator or the president of the United States and one of the pillars in your political platform was the view that man and the problems in society find their way back to the human condition that man is basically evil or sinful or bad and is in desperate need of a savior. How far do you think you'd get?
[time=1704] How many supporters do you think you'd have? As you began to propagate that view over the airwaves and in your literature and as you met with your groups, you would be counted a fool.
[time=1716] You would be counted dangerous. You would be counted a lunatic.
[time=1720] The press would have a field day with that particular position, not arguing its legitimacy but just identifying you as an absolute fool for suggesting such could be the case.
[time=1736] Yet, yet, there is enormous amount of evidence. There is an enormous amount of evidence that could lead us to the very clear conclusion that man is basically sinful and in need of a savior. Is there any evidence through time and history that points to the opposite that man is inherently good?
[time=1760] Where would you look for that?
[time=1764] Let's consider it on a few different levels. Let's take a look at the international scene and you can do that today in our current events or you can think back through history as you've learned it. Where is it on the international scale that we could come up with the notion that man is basically good?
[time=1780] The international scale is one long war after another. People murdering other people. Countries desiring what other countries have and imposing their desires on another country by their brute strength. That has been the legacy of international history and it is still with us today. For as long as man has been alive, as long as people have gathered into nations they have been warring with each other. They began so long ago with clubs and rocks and sticks and then they graduated to knives and swords and spears and bows and arrows. And then we graduated to guns and bullets and the weapon of choice today of course is a nuclear weapon a nuclear bomb. And though the method has changed through time the consistent theme in all of national histories is that they are at war with other people.
[time=1840] Why do you think that the United States of America has to spend as much as it does on national defense every single year year in and year out? Because we know beyond a shadow of a doubt. If we are not able to keep what we have by force someone will come and take it from us.
[time=1860] History teaches that. Only a fool would suggest that we could be rid of all of our armament and we would live happy and safe and secure inside the borders of the United States of America. We are only as safe and we are only as secure as we are strong. There is no evidence my friends on the international scene that man is basically good and getting better.
[time=1888] Let's come down from the national level and look at society. Let's look at communities. Not nations but groups inside of nations. Communities and groups of people.
[time=1900] And they are known to be civilized when they have law and order. Law and order. That means that they have certain prescribed behaviors that if you violate those there is an armed group of people we call them police who come and take you away because you are not safe for society. At the highest forms of civilization there is law and order that is enforced by a government and police because we know that without the police and without what we call law and order you would not be safe and I would not be safe.
[time=1936] We cannot put our trust in the intrinsic goodness of man and expect to keep our houses and our homes and our wives and our children. Remove the law and order that we know of and you will lose all your security because man in fact is not basically good. He is basically sinful and he will take from you whatever you have that he desires or she desires.
[time=1960] And even in the best of situations where law and order does exist and even when those enforcing the laws are elected by the people and for the people the unfortunate reality is that the people the best we can find and put in those positions of power we are learning over and over again in our own society and as we look back over history that even those we ask to govern us are themselves corrupt. They are in all their own sorts of schemes and shams and using their power not to protect us but to exploit us. There is corruption in every form and every level of government because there is a human being at every form and every level of government. You will not find evidence you will not find proof any other proof than that man is basically sinful and in need of a savior.
[time=2016] We go from the national picture to the community picture how about the smallest group of society that little group of people who huddle together under covenant and vow we call them a family.
[time=2028] Can we find evidence inside the homes of America that man is basically good and doesn't need a savior?
[time=2036] In fact the goal of households all over America is to somehow move past and rise above the selfishness and the anger and the fighting and the unfaithfulness that plagues the home. The most important promises that any individual makes he makes to those inside of his home to love and to cherish till death to us part but those promises are being broken at an unbelievable rate. The greatest incidents of homicide in the United States of America doesn't happen by one person who doesn't know another person. It is inside the context of that thing we call our homes. Most of the murders happen inside the context of the home not outside the home. The ugliest pictures of our society emerge when we see fathers sexually and mentally and physically abusing their children and mothers doing the same thing.
[time=2092] The greatest crimes in our society the most desperate ones to understand seem to be occurring inside the smallest unit of society called our households where the promises and the covenants are for good not for bad.
[time=2108] What evidence do you have inside of the home that man is basically good? I certainly don't see it. Conventional wisdom says that man is good but there is an avalanche of evidence throughout history and at every level of society that says that man is sinful.
[time=2128] But I'll go one step further Are you good? Are you good? Are you intrinsically good?
[time=2138] As you look inside your heart and you look inside your life are you able to support the notion that you are intrinsically good and getting better?
[time=2146] I don't mean good in comparison to the rest of us because the rest of us
[time=2154] are flawed. The rest of us are just like you are. We're born intrinsically evil and sinful and so when you compare yourself to somebody else there may be a comparative advantage but I'm asking are you good?
[time=2166] Is man basically good and are you a living proof that man is basically good and getting better and not in need of help?
[time=2174] A savior?
[time=2178] I'm not asking you if you're a law abiding citizen.
[time=2182] I'm asking you are you good? Most of us would have to face the overwhelming evidence in our lives that we are basically a bundle of self-centered fears, hopes, greed, jealousy and self-conceived and the evidence to support that is overwhelming.
[time=2200] We are held captive by this falsehood because when we continue to believe that we are basically good and not in need of a savior, when we are held in that belief system then we never go looking for a savior.
[time=2216] We never are honest with ourselves enough to know the truth about ourselves and then the obvious outcome of that would be to go find a help that's needed. It's an enslaving falsehood and like the days of old when people were terrified to move past the horizon and seek new lands so the basic human condition if he believes or if she believes that they are good they are held captive by that and they never explore and they never look for the help they need.
[time=2252] The wonderful reality is this Jesus said you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. You say to me what truth?
[time=2260] What is the truth that sets me free? You've explained one of the major falsehoods that keeps people captive but would you mind telling me the truth that sets people free? What is that?
[time=2272] Well I'll give you this morning four great truths associated with Christianity that set people free. Four great truths and if you understand these this morning and you apply them to your life you can be free, free in a way you've never been free before. I wanted to give you a chance to see this for yourself and so in your bulletin you might just take it you'll find there a little section that's entitled Ephesians 2 1-5 it's shaded, it's in a little box at the top it says Ephesians 2 1-5 there are a number of verses that just flow from God's Word and they contain four truths, four great truths that set people free.
[time=2320] Number one the first truth is this we are held captive and are cut off from relationship with God by our sin. If you read just the first few lines in that little passage of Scripture it says there you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world. Dead in your trespasses and sins. Let me explain something to you. The Word of God when it says dead it doesn't mean that you can't feel hunger, that you're not aware that we've got an incredible day going on outside, maybe the best so far as we've looked at spring, not aware of the fact of the person who's sitting next to you.
[time=2360] Dead doesn't mean that you are unable to be aware of what is around you at least as it's being used here.
[time=2368] The deadness that the Bible is talking about here comes out of a Jewish background and as you know much of the Bible was written to Jews about how to get right with God.
[time=2376] What would happen in the Jewish society is when a child a daughter or a son, and maybe you saw this in the movie Fiddler on the Roof when a child, a daughter or a son would break away from the religious beliefs of their parents. The Jewish religion required them to hold a funeral awake for the death of their child, not because they were physically dead and lost their awareness of their surroundings, but they were to treat them as dead.
[time=2404] You were out of our family. You were no longer a part of the fellowship and the love and the joy and the excitement of the bar mitzvahs and the Hanukkahs and the special holidays. You were never from that day forward allowed to be a part of what it meant to be family and in that sense they would say of that person you are dead to us.
[time=2424] You are dead to me. I no longer acknowledge your existence.
[time=2428] I no longer allow you to participate inside of this family. That's what that means.
[time=2432] And many of you can attest to that this morning. You are very aware of who you are.
[time=2436] You are very aware that you are outside of a family called the family of God. You are very aware that there is a father who is in heaven and you would like to be invited and included, but there is a separation there. The predominant feelings you have there are guilt and shame and being separated.
[time=2456] The first great truth there in Christianity is this we are held captive and cut off from relationship with God by our religion and it's a walking death. It's a walking lonely death of a life.
[time=2472] The second great truth is that we are basically bad not good.
[time=2480] We are basically bad not good. If you read again from this little passage you might have already circled the word dead just for your future reference, but read along and you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air of the spirit that is now working.
[time=2500] Here it is in the sons of disobedience.
[time=2504] Sons of disobedience. That's us. Keep reading.
[time=2508] Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our flesh indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind. Here it is again.
[time=2516] And we are by nature children of wrath.
[time=2520] The truth about the human being. The truth about me.
[time=2524] The truth about you is that when you and I were born we were born into the condition of being sons of disobedience and by nature children of wrath. Now I have five kids and I know that this is true from my own empirical experience. No I never once had to teach any one of my children to be selfish.
[time=2548] Someone would take a toy away from my child. I did not have to instruct my child to rant and to rave and get a look like I will now kill you unless you give that back to me. Never. I never had to teach one of my children to slap someone who took something. I never had to teach one of my children to listen to a clear, audible, direct command from their father. Look at me and absolutely defy it and walk away as if I didn't matter. You see these things come natural to them. It is inborn. They are children of wrath even as I was. As I look back on my experience in my childhood yeah I saw some examples of sinfulness. There were some cultural influences out there that might have indicated that other people were like this too but I'll tell you when I got crossed as a child nobody needed to instruct me how to be selfish and angry. I had that down pat. It just came from deep within me. I wasn't trying to be like somebody else. I was just being myself.
[time=2608] One of the liberating truths of Christianity is that we are basically bad not good.
[time=2612] Sons of disobedience and by children nature of wrath.
[time=2616] Well if that's the bad news, here comes the good news.
[time=2620] Here comes the good news. Keep reading with me will you?
[time=2624] We finish there and we're by children or excuse me we're by nature children of wrath even as the rest. That means everybody was that way. Nobody's left out of that category. But then look it says but God being rich in mercy because of his great love with which he loved us.
[time=2644] The third great truth of Christianity is that God loves us with a great love.
[time=2648] God has never not been in love with you.
[time=2652] He is head over heels in love with you.
[time=2656] He cares about you. He is committed to you and he wants to see you be free from the power of sin in your life.
[time=2664] You say how do I know that God loves me?
[time=2668] How I understand God. How do I know that God loves me?
[time=2672] There's two basic ways you think of it first in terms of a human relationship when boy meets girl and there's an attraction there and they begin to spend some time together and they begin to communicate and they find that they have a good strong friendship and then there's a kindred spirit and finally at dawns on them we are in love and somebody opens their mouth and says words of tremendous import, I love you. God has opened his mouth over and over and over again in the scriptures to tell you that he loves you.
[time=2700] You're holding one of them in your hands. He is saying to you this morning that I love you with a great love. I love you with a passionate love.
[time=2712] But it's not enough just to tell someone you love them is it?
[time=2716] Words are cheap if all you got is words.
[time=2720] What I know my wife is looking for and my love for her and what I know I'm looking for in her love for me. I want to see some demonstration of that. You say you love me. You see love is crying out for expression. True love is dying to express itself.
[time=2740] And so God demonstrated his love for you. You say how?
[time=2744] He sent his own son, Jesus Christ, to die for you. I don't know if you have kids.
[time=2752] I don't know how much they mean to you. I have five as I've said. I love every single one of them individually and uniquely. I was reminded of that just yesterday.
[time=2760] Almost lost one of my kids yesterday. And the fear that went through my heart and the pain of oh what in the world how would I cope without her?
[time=2772] The kids were out back in the pool and something had been left there on the pool.
[time=2776] And my littlest daughter my five-year-old who's a good swimmer but had gotten trapped underneath that object. And she almost died. She almost took a breath of water.
[time=2788] Fortunately by God's grace she didn't die yesterday. But I'll tell you something it brings a fresh and anew what it means when God says that he loved you so much he gave his only begotten son, his only child that you could have life.
[time=2808] I don't know how more powerfully anybody could demonstrate their love for you than to give up their child. That's exactly what Christ did when he died on the cross for you.
[time=2820] God loves you with a great love. God's love for you is never ending. It is unconditional. It is without anything in return he just loves you and he has pursued you and he has told you that he loves you and he has demonstrated his love for you in Christ. Number four, fourth great truth of Christianity is this you can be made alive to God through Christ look at it in the little passage that you're reading about here today see we left off at his great love with which he loved us even when we were dead in our transgressions he made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been saved. If you'll go back to the illustration of the Jewish family God has made a way for that Jewish family to be reunited and for that child who was wayward to come back and to be a part of the family and to enjoy the festivities and to know the joy and to be complete and whole in the relationship with the rest of the members in that family.
[time=2884] Becoming set free by the power of Christ is to acknowledge and to accept the forgiveness that comes in Christ and he makes you alive Christ makes you alive to God and there's peace and there's joy and it's like going home very few of us I guess will ever be inside of a real jail cell just as we're closing and before we stand for a word of prayer I just wanted to share with you my experience of slavery to sin when I was 18 years old graduating from high school I was free I was enjoying the privileges and the freedom that Tim spoke of that many of men and women have died for in this country to keep us free in the political sense of the word. I had so many choices and I loved my choices I was offered football scholarships from several different colleges and got to choose which one I wanted to go to I had been working and saving money so that I could buy a car and within my budget I could buy any kind of car I wanted to buy I ended up buying this really cool yellow Volkswagen bug with a convertible top it was it was boss it was way cool and the chicks dug it and when I got to college again within limits I could pick whichever girlfriend I wanted to have I mean they weren't all head over heels but there were enough of them that were interested that I could select which one I wanted to go after and I was free to choose because I went to college in California I often had another choice to make to not go to class and spend the afternoon at the beach tremendous freedom and choice exercised it as often as I could I was free you know I was free but I want you to know in a very real sense I was a slave I was enslaved to sin what I mean by that I was enslaved to something inside of me that always wanted more no matter how good it got no matter how much fun that one had been no matter how honored I might have felt in a particular situation I always wanted more and no matter where I went I always had to take me along and wherever I went came this slave driver this task master inside of me that was always wanting more and more and more and I could never get but a short breath of really being satisfied and content and as soon as I felt it seemed to leave and I was on the war path again I found that it began to destroy my relationships with people it began to dawn at me that I was using people I wasn't really in relationship with them I was just with them so long as they could give me what I wanted I found that I was making choices in the area of personal character that were way out of bounds for a normal kid inside of moral boundaries before I was 20 years old I was involved in those several years letter in high school and early in college in drugs and immorality and cheating and lying and stealing and there was no boundary left that I wouldn't cross to satisfy the slavery of my soul to find yet another little piece of satisfaction totally enslaved totally and completely enslaved to man what a realization it was it happened to me when I realized that I was driving a cement truck for my summer job and it was as if it finally dawned I mean I don't think this was my imagery I didn't feel like I was locked behind the bars I felt like I was shackled with sin and I saw a principle inside of me that there was no way I was going to break free of the stuff on my own there was no way I knew there was no way I was strong enough to break away from me and what I was and I remember sitting there at noon in that cement truck crying out to God saying oh God can you forgive me and can you free me it's not enough God to forgive me I need forgiveness and what I have done is wrong and the people I have hurt are deeply hurt and the way that I have used and manipulated oh God forgive me for that but God if you don't have enough to free me from me then let's not even start because I'm wicked I'm sinful I'm selfish something bigger than me had to change and I don't know how God did that but I just had a sense that he was saying you got it in fact I'm in the people changing business I'm in the business of setting people free from the power of sin and I put my faith in Christ to do that in that cement truck about noon in the middle of Los Angeles and I'm different today I'm really different you think I'm weird but I'm just different I'm different from the inside out now I didn't say I was perfect I didn't say I haven't sinned since that fateful day when I accepted Christ as my personal Lord and Savior in the middle of Los Angeles in the cement truck I've sinned a boatload but I'll tell you what I'm sinning less and less and less over time and I hate my sin and I'm finding a freedom to live outside of this demanding thing to always have to have me satisfied and God is transforming my life over time but I'm not in there anymore I'm on the outside flawed as I am I'm free I'm free because Christ has set me free indeed and I know that the day is coming I know that the day is coming when Christ is going to come back and take me to heaven and then I'll be totally and forever free of my sin well thank you for taking a moment to listen to my experience with freedom I long for you to have that experience I long for you to have that experience if you are here today and your heart is resonating with the idea that you are not really free to live the way you want to live because wherever you go you take you with you and you're a selfish person and you're never satisfied and you're finding that you're doing things today to find satisfaction that are destructive that damage yourself image and damage the people in your life and you like to be set free I'm telling you there's hope for real freedom today in the person of Christ would you stand with me now for a closing word of prayer

[time=3326] to talk to you about one of the most important decisions you could ever make in your life and as you know from the message it's a message that can set you free it's a message that can free you from being in bondage to your own sin and to your own greed and to your own lust for more and you can begin to have a transformed heart and a transformed life by the power of Jesus Christ all that begins through a prayer where you commit your life to God by admitting you're basically bad not good that you are a sinner and that you need a savior and that savior is Jesus Christ and I don't fully understand all about that but I do know that when you pray to God and you ask him for forgiveness in the person of Jesus Christ he hears that prayer he answers that prayer and he'll forgive you for your sins and begin to transform your life by the very power of Christ so I want to invite you to pray with me if you're feeling at all the presence of a need to be forgiven for your sins and you want the power of God in your life I invite you to bow your head right now where you are and say in your heart to God what I'm going to say out loud God will hear you let's pray together Father I know that I am a sinner I know that I am a child of wrath I know that nobody had to teach me how to sin it just comes from somewhere deep inside me and I confess to you that sin and I confess to you that I need a savior to forgive me for my sins and to have the power to change the way I live each and every day change my heart change my attitude change everything about me God so that I can live for your glory and for your honor and so I pray to receive Christ right now as my personal Lord and savior I invite him into my heart and into my life and thank you for forgiving me and thank you for saving me through Jesus Christ amen well if you just prayed that prayer God has heard you and if you mint it from your heart he has sent his spirit the Holy Spirit into your heart and into your life to begin the work of transformation in your life and as you study God's Word as you find your way into a strong local church that can help you grow and as you submit to the power of the Holy Spirit in your life you're going to find that you're free from the power of your sin and you can grow it takes time and it's hard work but you can be free well if you've made that decision please write us here at the Bible hour and let us know about that exciting development in your life God bless you in a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of lessons on assurance or the booklet by Muriel Larson entitled Petals of Praise you can also receive a cassette copy of today's message just ask for tape number 1709 or mention the message by Pastor Moore entitled freedom your gift of three dollars will cover the cost of the tape the financial gifts from the Bible hour Founders Club help support this ministry if you'd like to join the Founders Club just write to us now here's our address the Bible hour 7400 East State Fort Wayne Indiana 46815 this is Jeff Carlson speaking on behalf of Pastor Moore and the entire Bible hour staff inviting you to join us each week for the Bible hour
