[time=559] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come to Colossians chapter 4, as we near the end of our study in this wonderful book of Paul written to a group of believers, a church or two or three in and around the city of Colossae.
[time=584] And he comes and brings us to a subject this morning that if I think we were to Paul Christians, not just in this church, but around the world, we would all have to confess it's a category we're not doing as well and as we would like or certainly as we feel we ought to be.
[time=600] And this message on text should stand as a strong challenge to rekindle our prayer life.
[time=607] Chapter 4 verses 2, 3, and 4, he says, "Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving, praying at the same time for us as well that God may open to us a door for the word so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ for which I have also been imprisoned in order that I may make it clear in the way that I ought to speak.
[time=633] This text is relatively simple to understand and to talk about it is very difficult to live.
[time=640] It breaks very nicely, verse 2, a passion for prayer, and then verses 3 and 4, a request for prayer, a passion for prayer and a request for prayer.
[time=650] He says in verse 2, "Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving.
[time=655] Maybe I could just describe for you what I think the apostle is meaning here by devote yourselves to prayer. I'd then like to illustrate it and kind of bring it alive from about three or four different texts."
[time=666] And then having done that come back and try to answer the real issue which is why most of us don't do this.
[time=671] Why most of us don't devote ourselves to prayer and hopefully give you some help to get over that hurdle again and be back into a strong, vibrant prayer life.
[time=682] The word to devote means to adhere to, to persist in, or to busy oneself with.
[time=690] Paul is calling us to adhere to the practice of diligent prayer, to do it so often that we persist in it, that it busies our life with devotion to prayer.
[time=704] The call for devotion to prayer goes out long and clear throughout all of Scripture. I'll give you a few references.
[time=712] Ephesians 6, 18, with all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the Spirit.
[time=718] 1 Thessalonians 5, 17, pray without ceasing.
[time=722] Luke 21, 36, at all times, praying that you may have strength.
[time=728] It certainly marked the early church in Acts 1, 14 where it says they were continually devoting themselves to prayer.
[time=735] In Acts 6 the leadership of the church refused to be caught up in the daily affairs of the church so they could devote themselves to prayer.
[time=743] Romans 12, 12 devoted to prayer, I mean it's everywhere.
[time=748] And it is such an incredibly high standard that many of us, when we read these notions or understand the notion of praying without ceasing,
[time=757] praying at all times, and there is truth to this, we say I know what that means, that means you walk around with a God consciousness.
[time=767] And everything that you see, you instantly talk to God about it, and that's certainly true.
[time=772] I know that probably for you it's the same with me when I drive by an accident of some kind, an automobile accident.
[time=779] I am instantly praying for the people who have been hurt, for the medical people who will help, and I often find myself praying for the family members
[time=786] that ripple effect, and I'm asking God to work salvation in people's hearts, and maybe this will be the time that shocks them into an awareness of their own need.
[time=795] That's certainly what it means to pray without ceasing, and I'm sure you do that.
[time=799] An unbeliever goes by an accident scene and has a feeling of compassion and is possibly sorrowed by the circumstance,
[time=806] maybe remembers a hardship in their own life, but most likely doesn't enter into specific prayer for the advancement of the cause of Christ
[time=814] in and through these adverse circumstances.
[time=818] So there's no question that to honor this notion of being devoted to prayer, praying at all times, praying without ceasing,
[time=824] it includes seeing everything in life in the ongoing dialogue that you have with your heavenly Father.
[time=831] But I want to suggest that it means a whole lot more than that.
[time=835] I mean that is not enough, that is certainly nowhere near the kind of devotion to prayer that the Word of God would call us to.
[time=843] And I think the Lord knew that, and so He gave us a couple of parables to really explain to us the kind of devotion,
[time=852] the kind of commitment that He intends for us to have inside of prayer.
[time=857] And I'd like to show them both to you.
[time=858] Come to the Book of Luke, the Gospel of Luke, and it is just unmistakable, the kind of commitment that He wants from us.
[time=867] Luke chapter 18 is the first parable.
[time=874] In Luke chapter 18 verse 1, it says there, "He was telling them a parable to show them that at all times they ought to pray and not lose heart."
[time=884] And this just seems to be a problem with we believers.
[time=887] We pray from time to time, we don't pray all the time, and sometimes we lose heart and we don't pray anymore.
[time=892] We stop praying.
[time=894] And so He says, "You guys need a parable." Verse 2, "There was in a certain city a judge who did not fear God and did not respect man, a real live living judge."
[time=903] At least as the parable is told, I mean the one that you and I would think of, living in a city, living with people,
[time=909] and He didn't fear God and He didn't respect man.
[time=912] There was a widow in that city in verse 3, and she kept coming to Him, you might underline that.
[time=917] She kept coming to Him saying, "Give me legal protection from my opponent." And for a while he was unwilling, but afterwards he said to himself, "Even though I do not fear God nor respect man."
[time=928] Verse 5, "Yet because this widow bothers me," you might underline that.
[time=933] "I will give her legal protection lest by continually coming she wear me out."
[time=939] You might underline that.
[time=941] What you find there is she kept coming to Him.
[time=944] She bothered him and he finally granted her request not out of justice and fear of God and respect for man,
[time=951] but because he was sick and tired of being bothered.
[time=955] It was easier for him just to make a decision in her favor than to have to constantly undergo the barrage of requests
[time=962] that came from this poor lady's life that she could have justice.
[time=966] And this is her only means.
[time=968] She is a widow.
[time=970] She doesn't know anybody.
[time=971] She's not well connected.
[time=972] She has no finances.
[time=974] She has no way to twist this guy's arm in a political sense.
[time=976] She has but one asset, one card to play.
[time=980] I am persistent.
[time=983] You will hear from me again on this one.
[time=987] Now, verses 6 and 7.
[time=989] And the Lord said, "Here what the unrighteous judge said.
[time=993] Now shall not God bring about justice for his elect." You might underline this one.
[time=998] "Who cried to him day and night." Now that's fascinating.
[time=1005] The Lord is inviting you to be a pest.
[time=1009] A spiritual pest.
[time=1011] A spiritual bother.
[time=1013] He wants you to approach your prayer life with a sense of persistence that bothers him into giving you what you want.
[time=1023] Now the parable, as is true of all parables, only has one main point. And it does not teach that God is unjust, and it does not teach that God will only give you things when you bother Him enough.
[time=1033] That's not the point of this parable. The point of the parable is about you and about me, and that we ought to not lose heart and pray at all times.
[time=1040] Well, help me, Lord. What would that look like? Well, it'd be like a lady with no other resource, and all she can do is come back, and back, and back, and back, and back, and back, and back.
[time=1050] Pray like that. Devote yourself to prayer.
[time=1055] Come with me to another, supposing, another parable, Luke 11.
[time=1060] And here again, our Lord is giving us instruction, giving His disciples instruction, and through them, us.
[time=1068] Now, as you know from setting His life, He prayed all the time. He was always in a constant conversation of prayer with God, His Father.
[time=1076] But He also set time aside, and He would reserve large amounts of time to be in private prayer with His heavenly Father.
[time=1086] He did it so often and so much that the disciples eventually asked this question in verse 1, Luke 11 1. Lord, teach us to pray just as John also taught His disciples.
[time=1098] I mean, we see you doing this. We see you disappearing up into the mountain all night. We see you taking this over here and wanting us to pray within.
[time=1105] We don't so much do it because we don't so much know how. Lord, you got us. We're asking you, please tell us how.
[time=1111] So He gives the pattern of prayer in the Lord's prayer, which you find there in 2, 3, and 4. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1121] But here we come to what I want you to see. Look at verse 5. He showed Him how to pray. He's now taught them how to pray, but verse 5, He said to them, suppose one of you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight.
[time=1136] And say to him, "Friend, lend me three loaves." Why? Well, because I have a friend and He has come to me from a journey and I have nothing to set before Him.
[time=1146] And from inside He shall answer and say, verse 7, "Do not bother me." The door has already been shut and my children and I are in bed and I cannot get up and give you anything.
[time=1159] Now that has meaning to me because I have five kids and many times they are in bed with us and you can't get out of bed. You're smothered under all the kids.
[time=1169] It's warm, it's cozy, the family's together, the door is shut. I'm not getting out of bed. I don't care how good a friend you are.
[time=1176] Verse 8, "I tell you, even though He will not get up and give Him anything because He is a friend, yet because of His persistence, He will get up and give Him as much as He needs." Isn't that interesting?
[time=1192] Jesus has said, "You are my friends." And there is another side of all this that He wants you to know. You gotta bug Him. You have to be persistent. You have to stay at it.
[time=1207] Long periods of time. Over and over and over again beseeching God to get up out of bed and give you what you want.
[time=1216] Now of course the parable doesn't mean that God has children in there and His bed and it's locked. No, the point is persistence. Don't rely merely upon your friendship with God for the granting of your requests. Be persistent.
[time=1231] Labor with Him in prayer for what you're seeking. Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel, which means He who struggles with God, got His name changed to that because He wrestled with the true and living God.
[time=1247] And He wouldn't let God go until He got a blessing. Now it cost him a little bit, put his hip out of joint and he limped the rest of his life, but he wrestled with God.
[time=1258] God is inviting you to wrestle with Him through the means of prayer. And to do it persistent and to do it long to the extent that He is in the parable bothered. You are so persistent. You are so regular. You are so tenacious.
[time=1276] A great preacher of the old guy by the name of Beater Wolf said it this way, "There is such a thing as taking heaven by storm. God honors heroic faith, a faith that will not be denied."
[time=1291] In 1540, Luther's great friend and assistant Frederick Myconius became sick and was expected to die in a short time. On his bed, he wrote a loving farewell note to Luther with a trembling hand.
[time=1306] Luther received the letter and instantly sent back a reply. It read this quote, "I command you in the name of God to live.
[time=1314] I still need you in the work of reforming the church. The Lord will never let me hear that you are dead, but will permit you to outlive me.
[time=1323] For this I am praying. This is my will and my will be done because my will seeks to glorify God."
[time=1334] That's hot. This is my will. I thought we were supposed to pray. The Lord's will. This is my will and my will be done because my will seeks to glorify God.
[time=1345] Now the interesting part of this true story is that his good partner and friend Frederick arose from his sick bed only two weeks later, lived his entire life and didn't die until two months after Luther died.
[time=1358] Now I could list prayer answer after prayer answer after prayer answer after the annals of Christian history that would illustrate this kind of thing.
[time=1366] But let's be honest. Let's be honest. A lot of us have stopped praying like this.
[time=1373] One of the most of us has stopped praying like this. I mean I certainly go in and out and more often out than in this kind of persistent prayer for a very simple reason.
[time=1384] I don't know how it works. I don't know how it works. Either God's sovereign or he isn't. And if he's sovereign he's going to do what he's going to do.
[time=1395] And how does prayer affect that sovereignty of God? And if I am coming after God over and over and over and over and over again for a request, how can I have the assurance that that is even what he wants?
[time=1410] I mean if I'm not just going to pray broad generalities, Lord your will be done, Lord your will be done.
[time=1415] I mean if I'm going to pray for specific things inside my life and the life of my kids and the life of this church, I'm praying maybe against what?
[time=1423] And probably all of us have had experiences where we have felt the intense desire to pray at this level of devotion have done so, maybe for a physical need of a family member or a spiritual need of a family member.
[time=1436] And we have found that despite the labor of prayer the answer has gone the opposite direction.
[time=1443] We become disappointed and we become a little gun shy of believing at that level and setting yourself up for that kind of disappointment.
[time=1455] So how? How we do it? Why don't we do it? I believe we feel on a very deep level that it doesn't work and we have experiences in our lives we can point to that seem to give evidence to the fact that it doesn't work.
[time=1472] Well I will admit still confusion on all that. I certainly don't know how all that adds up to the sovereignty of God and there are a lot of cute little cliches that seem to answer it.
[time=1481] But what I did find this week if you'd come with me to Genesis chapter 18 I want to give you four principles that I think if you keep in mind will allow you even amidst that uncertainty about the sovereignty of God to pray like you're being called to pray upon.
[time=1498] Call upon to pray. I believe you can pray like this if you'll hold these four principles in your mind.
[time=1506] Now you know Abraham, and this passage is about Abraham, and Abraham is a great man of faith, a patriarch of the nation of Israel, a friend of God, a tremendous human being.
[time=1517] He has heard word that God is going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, and to bring great concern into his life because he has there his own nephew Lot and the life of Lot and the two daughters.
[time=1530] He has family there. And so he begins to go to prayer with God. He begins a dialogue over this issue with God, and I think there are four principles here that may give you encouragement to continue to pray in a devoted fashion.
[time=1545] Number one, read verse 23, Genesis 18 verse 23, and Abraham came near and said, "Wilt thou indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?"
[time=1560] Point one or principle one is don't be put off in prayer because you don't know what God is going to do.
[time=1568] Abraham did not know what God was going to do. God said in a broad sweeping way, "I am going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah."
[time=1575] There was the possibility that there were some righteous people inside that city, and Abraham didn't know just how broad sweeping God had spoken.
[time=1584] And was he actually going to destroy the wicked along, excuse me, the righteous along with the wicked?
[time=1591] In other words, this great man of God who walked with God, who was the man of great covenant and promise, found himself often in life in a situation where he genuinely did not know what God had in mind.
[time=1605] That is not uncommon, my friend. That is not unfamiliar territory to the saints of God. That is, in fact, part and parcel of life and walking with God to be genuinely confused about what he may do tomorrow.
[time=1619] We don't always know his will.
