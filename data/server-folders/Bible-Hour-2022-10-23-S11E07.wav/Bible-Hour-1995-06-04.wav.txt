[time=0] And the issue that Paul is addressing here to this little church in Colossae and through
[time=7] that letter to the church of Blackhawk this morning is, "How do we reach the outsider?
[time=14] How do we win people to Christ?
[time=16] How can we be faithful to the great commission?
[time=18] How can we bear fruit?
[time=21] How can we be like Christ, whose sole mission was to come and seek and save those who were lost?"
[time=34] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=38] Have you ever been on the outside?
[time=40] Have you ever been left out?
[time=43] Do you know what it feels like to be an outsider?
[time=46] You certainly don't want to be left out of the church.
[time=49] Find out today what God's word has to say about the outsider.
[time=54] Now let's join our service.
[time=58] I will declare it to the nations.
[time=154] Oh, tell the good news that Jesus has given you peace.
[time=171] I will declare it to the nations.
[time=207] Oh, tell the good news that Jesus has given you peace.
[time=242] I will declare it to the nations.
[time=263] Hi my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour and thank you for joining us today.
[time=268] In our study of God's word from Colossians chapter 4, we come to one of those issues
[time=274] that oftentimes we as believers don't want to have to face or involve ourselves in.
[time=279] That's the topic of personal evangelism.
[time=281] The Bible couldn't be any clearer that we're called as individuals, not just corporately as a church and not just for the missionary and not just for some people in our church, but for each and every one of us to be involved in personal evangelism, cultivating relationships
[time=296] with the unsaved and inviting them inside the context of that relationship to consider the difference that Christ can make in their life and as the Lord gives opportunity even
[time=307] to present the gospel and to see people come to Christ.
[time=311] And I know that in my personal life that's one of the greatest challenges, it's so easy for me to be caught up in the church and caught up with all my Christian friends and all my Christian activities, I almost have no time to be involved with unbelievers or so I think.
[time=326] Well the text today is in no uncertain terms going to teach us and call us and instruct us back to that priority of personal evangelism.
[time=335] The great news is that I want to let you know of a tremendous resource that's out there for Christians to learn even in a more practical way and over time with the help of other believers how to be involved in a fresh new approach to personal evangelism.
[time=350] The curriculum is called living proof and it's all about you and it's all about me becoming living proof.
[time=356] It's published by the Christian Businessman's Committee, CBMC and they can help you.
[time=362] You can pick this curriculum up at any Christian bookstore.
[time=366] It runs for about 13 weeks in length that has a tremendous video segue that comes with each lesson that kind of gives you insights into the practical parts of personal evangelism.
[time=376] It's designed to be studied with a small group of fellow Christians who are also concerned
[time=383] and committed to growing in this particular aspect and so it's a tremendous thing and if you just follow this curriculum I guarantee you you will be involved in personal evangelism in a very short amount of time, it's just tremendous curriculum and very practical.
[time=395] I recommend it to you, it's living proof and you can pick it up at any one of your local Christian bookstores.
[time=425] [MUSIC]
[time=455] And I love thee because thou had first love had made and you purchased my heart and uncalvories
[time=478] tree, I love thee for wearing those thorns on thy ground and if ever I love thee.
[time=502] My Jesus, his love and in mansions of glory and endless delight I'll ever adore.
[time=532] For thee in heaven so bright and I'll sing with the glittering crown on my bride.
[time=552] That if ever I love thee, my Jesus, his love, my Jesus.
[time=579] [MUSIC]
[time=592] We'll return to our service in just a moment but right now I'd like to tell you about our special gift from the Bible Hour, a lovely digital desk clock with an inspiring picture
[time=603] of two climbers forging up a mountain side and the inscription together we achieve the
[time=609] extraordinary.
[time=610] This handsome teamwork digital desk clock is our free gift to you when you write to the Bible Hour.
[time=616] Stay tuned I'll be giving you our address at the end of the program.
[time=621] Let me invite you to come to Colossians chapter four as we're nearing the end of our study of this wonderful book and today we learn from God about his perspective on the outsider
[time=637] Colossians chapter four verses five and six, conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders making the most of the opportunity.
[time=645] Let your speech always be with grace seasoned as it were with salt so that you may know how you should respond to each person.
[time=653] I don't know about you but when I think about being on the outside as opposed to being on
[time=659] the inside being left out of a group as opposed to being included in the group my mind shoots back to fourth grade my family just moved to a new city and I made a couple of friends James Lip and Ruben Gonzalez and we just did everything together the same routine we get to school a little early there in fourth grade and talk about some important things like our bikes and our tennis shoes and stuff like that and we'd run into class and then we'd have break at recess and the routine went on.
[time=683] You can tell there's one day when I showed up and I was left out and they were there but they were obviously separate from me and want me to be a part of that little group and it really disappointed me and hurt me and made me feel horrible and I went to class and finally at recess I kind of caught up with them and kind of found a way to get them to tell me what in the world was up and they didn't want me to be a part of that little group that day because they were chewing chewing tobacco you see for the very first time in their lives and they were afraid that if I knew about it that I would tell on them and so they left me out of their group and I assured them that if they were just give me some I wouldn't tell on them which they probably did and I probably got sick but I remember
[time=723] the sense of being left out and wishing I could have been included in what they were doing and of course in that case it would have been better that I just kind of endure the feelings of being left out and kind of obey my parents rather than fit in with the group but you may have felt it looking for a job and it was a group you really wanted to be a part of and you just weren't allowed you never got the job or maybe it was a school you wanted to attend and you felt that was kind of the beginning of new things for you but you couldn't get in maybe it's a social group here in the church maybe it's a friendship deal in your neighborhood wherever it is we know what it's like to be on the outside and it's a horrible feeling but as bad as that is in some of the dimensions I've just mentioned there is no greater point of tragedy than being on the outside when what you're
[time=765] talking about is the church because when you are on the outside of the church you are left out of the greatest thing that has ever been known to men you have been left out of salvation you have been left out of forgiveness you've been left out of the grace of God and though you may not feel badly about it at the time there will come a time when it dawns on you all that you've missed by being on the outside an eternity of being on the outside.
[time=791] In Ephesians 2 you don't need to turn there it describes the outsider this way remember that you were at that time separate from Christ excluded from the commonwealth of Israel strangers
[time=802] to the covenants of promise having no hope and without God in the world you want to know
[time=808] what it's like to be on the outside and you want to know the worst place ever to be on the outside it's in relationship to the church and missing the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=817] To be separate from Him to be excluded from the commonwealth of Israel to be strangers from the covenants of promise and here it is having no hope and without God in the world you are left outside but God has a tremendous heart of compassion for people who are on the
[time=833] outside of the church he can't stand the thought he wants the outside to become the inside he
[time=839] wants the outsider to understand the things of God it says as that passage in Ephesians goes on it says this but now in Christ Jesus you who were formerly far off have been brought
[time=850] near by the blood of Christ it means so much to God and in this context that the Gentiles
[time=858] should know what it means to come to Christ that he sent his own son and shed his blood to make way for the outsider to become the insider it's an interesting term that Paul
[time=870] uses here in Colossians 4 he doesn't call him the unregenerate the unbeliever the ungodly the pagan the sinner he says the outsider and I think they're incongering at least hopefully
[time=882] inside of us some sense of compassion some sense of man I know what it's like to be on the outside and while it's true that God has made provision for the outsider to become the insider we live in a real world in real space and time and those outsiders have their own view on this thing and they have their own reasons why they're on the outside and maybe even why they want to stay on the outside and they have their questions about we who are on the inside and our Christ and our Christianity and our God and they have a boatload of misunderstandings
[time=913] and misconceptions and falsehoods and spiritual blindness and personal sin that keep them out there on the outside but this passage is directed to us about reaching them and accomplishing
[time=924] in some small way the heart of God that the outsider could become the insider and how do we do that how is it God's design what is God's pattern for us to reach the outsider
[time=936] and to make the outsider the insider how do we win people to Christ how can we be found
[time=943] faithful to the great commission how can we bear fruit how can we be like Christ who as
[time=949] you know had his sole purpose for coming to the earth that he might seek and say the lost how is this all going to transport transpire well it boils down at least in these verses the two very simple things in verse five he calls us to walk a distinctly Christian life
[time=964] or walk or lifestyle verse five conduct yourselves with wisdom toward the outside outsider making
[time=970] the most of the opportunity and then he says in verse six there's a second thing you need to do and that's talk you got to walk and then you got to talk let your speech always be
[time=982] with grace seasoned as it were with salt so that you may know how you should respond to each person in other words verse five live the life of a totally transformed individual
[time=993] where the power of God has shaken your existence to its very foundation and rebuilt itself in such a way that there is no question as to your identity in Christ walk a truly transformed
[time=1005] life but verse six be sure to tell the story oh I love to tell the story tell the people
[time=1013] who you were before you met Christ tell the people the tragedy of your life before you found Christ and tell them how you got saved tell them the very unique and wonderful process
[time=1023] how God took you by the hand and step by step through a sequence of events led you to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ walk and talk very simply let's look at these two these
[time=1035] two verses this morning verse five walk the walk now this is not a comprehensive statement
[time=1041] on everything that a Christian must do in evangelism and in their lifestyle it is rather
[time=1047] he'll give verse in verse five two simple principles of how you walk your walk and as
[time=1053] it was for example in chapter three verses 18 to 21 when he talked about the family he didn't tell us everything about the wife's responsibility everything about the husband's role everything about the children he kind of boiled it down and so he's doing that here in this little section on personal evangelism but he'll give us two very succinct and powerful
[time=1072] principles about walking an evangelistic lifestyle the first and verse five conduct yourselves
[time=1079] with wisdom toward the outsider the word conduct means the practice of your life it
[time=1086] means in the daily affairs of your life the practice and the pattern the habitual routine of your life let it be marked by the wisdom of God you say well what's that what is the
[time=1096] wisdom of God very simply it is skillfully and attractively applying God's truth to your
[time=1103] life wisdom is skillful living and when it's the wisdom of God it is skillfully living according to God's truth letting it transform your life looking at this this week and I found maybe
[time=1116] the best way to clarify that for you is by showing the walk of a fool we'll talk about the walk of wisdom in a minute but first let's remember the walk of a fool the New Testament speaks of it in first Timothy 6 it says if you have food and covering be content speaking
[time=1132] to the Christian if you have food and covering be content those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires which plunge men into
[time=1143] ruin and destruction the fool is the one who says my life consists of my possessions the
[time=1149] fool is the one who never finds contentment in what he has and always believed that with the next purchase the next income the next opportunity materialistically then I will be happy that is the mark of a fool the mark of wisdom is to walk inside of contentment even
[time=1165] if all you have is food and covering be content and don't for a minute think that your unbelieving
[time=1171] friend your outsider cannot tell which dimension you function in if you are living in such
[time=1179] a way that you believe the next purchase the next level of income the next material thing
[time=1185] in your life is what's going to satisfy you and make you happy even as a believer your unsaved friend can spot that a million miles away they can sense that dynamic in you because
[time=1194] it runs strong in them and they think to themselves you're no different than I am but give me a Christian who is truly content to the core of their being even if all they
[time=1205] have is food and clothing and you'll stick out like a sore thumb you will be so remarkably
[time=1211] different and you'll send off vibes if you will and a perspective and a principled way of life that will be so different to them your walk will be marked by wisdom not foolishness
[time=1224] I found another passage that marked the walk of the fool Galatians 3 it says are you so foolish speaking to the Galatians having begun by the spirit are you now being protected by the flesh the foolish walk is one of legalism the foolish walk is one that says I can please
[time=1241] God by my behavioral standards and if that is the mark of your Christian walk even though
[time=1247] you're born again even though you've begun by the spirit and yet you have fallen back into a legalistic lifestyle where your Christianity is bound up in what you do and what you don't do and what you the performances of external religion and you're all defined and you're all fleshed out I do this and I don't do that and there's a spirit of legalism that attends it your unbelieving friend your outsider can smell it a million miles away and there is nothing inviting and there is nothing compelling and there is nothing intriguing at all about you when you walk that way it's the walk of a fool what is interesting and what is provocative
[time=1283] and what is inviting and what is contagious is the liberty that we have in Christ when
[time=1290] you are born again and you are set free and you are overwhelmed by the grace of God in your life that is an undeserving center God forgave you for everything past, present and future which doesn't give you license to continue to sin but you walk with an aura and a feeling
[time=1306] and a sense of gratitude I'm loved and I'm forgiven and I'm free to live my life as an expression of love to Christ there is a magnet that is something that the unbeliever finds
[time=1318] very interesting and very intriguing that is the wisdom of God lived in your life James
[time=1325] three says who among you is wise and understanding let him show by his good behavior his deeds and the gentleness of wisdom there's a heart that has been transformed and it no longer
[time=1337] seats its satisfaction and its fullness in the things of this world in fact it can be content with as little as food and coveting basic one step above poverty existence and
[time=1349] it is a heart that is overflowing with the grace and the wonder and the privilege of being totally and completely forgiven for all of sin and the knowledge that nothing
[time=1359] that I can do can ever add or subtract to the salvation that I have in the person of Christ I am free to live in a gracious compassionate gentle compelling way when the unbeliever
[time=1370] goes mmm now you're truly different to me I've met other religious people but they run
[time=1377] their religion on legalism I've met other religious people before but they have running underneath the very thin the near of their commitment as much materialism as anybody else I've ever seen who are you who what are you and what did this to you wisdom you don't
[time=1397] need to look very far for others examples of what it would mean to walk in wisdom look at chapter three verse five the new man in Christ you want to know what it means to walk
[time=1406] in wisdom get rid of immorality impurity passion evil desire greed all of that amounts to idolatry you want to walk in wisdom look at verse eight set aside the anger and the wrath and the malice and the slander and abusive speech from your mouth that's all the relational garbage that the world gets involved in as they spew out things towards each other and involved in all kinds of slander and all that junk you want to know what it walks means to walk in wisdom read verse 12 put on a heart of compassion and kindness and humility and gentleness and patience and bear with one another and forgive one another walk in
[time=1439] wisdom verse 16 let the word of Christ richly dwell within you with all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with Psalms and hymns want to walk in wisdom have an utterly transformed home where the wife is subject to the husband verse 19 the husband loves the wife verse 20 the children are obedient to their parents verse 21 the fathers don't exasperate their children you want to live in wisdom in a way that's compelling and inviting
[time=1464] to the unbeliever verse 23 let it transform the workplace whatever you do do your work hardly as for the Lord rather than for men these are the compelling components of a transformed
[time=1476] life which are put on display walk in wisdom my friends and the outsider will be amazed
[time=1488] make the regular constant pattern of your life the skillful attractive application of God's truth to your life and you're on your way. Proverbs 1130 says this the fruit of
[time=1500] the righteous is a tree of life and he who is wise wins souls the fruit of the righteous
[time=1508] is a tree of life what you produce in your life by your righteous godly lifestyle is a tree of life and you are wise because you win souls win souls to wisdom win souls to
[time=1520] the fear of God wins souls to reverence the true and living God as it stands in its Old Testament context now in their day I mean the day of the Colossians these are real people
[time=1531] living in a real city with real struggles and trials in their Christian life in their day the quality of their lives was their only defense they had no long legacy of Christian
[time=1543] virtue standing behind them they were the first generation Christians they were the only Christians anybody ever knew about there were no history books there were no wives tales there were stories there were no traditions of what the Christians had done in earlier days the martyrs who had died their death those who had cared for the sick those would transform entire parts of civilization as the gospel invaded that area there's nothing just them that's all they had and they were subject to great misunderstanding and slander
[time=1572] their externals were different enough that they became peculiar in some ways and then subject to slander they were called atheists because they served no visible God they were called unpatriotic because they burned no incense before the emperor they were called immoral because of necessity they would often meet behind closed doors locked doors because the persecution was so great they have a moment's peace of mind and privacy for worship they would lock the door and then in so doing be called immoral as if the assumption was you were doing behind those closed doors what the pagan religions do behind their closed doors and Paul knew the best and only way for these young Christians to rise above the
[time=1607] slander and present Christ was to walk daily in wisdom think about it now they had no church
[time=1615] buildings they had no Christian radio they had no signs no bumper stickers no gospel tracks no Christian books no Christian bookstores no musical productions no dramas if the message
[time=1627] was going to get out they had to live Christ in a powerful relevant clear way in the wisdom of God's truth so maybe today we'd be better off if we could throw away all the buildings and the radios and the signs and the bumper stickers and the tracks and the books and all just throw it all away just have nothing just have absolutely nothing that represents Christianity except your life and my life and the way we interact together and the way we
[time=1651] love each other and the way we care for each other and the way we reach out to other people maybe that would be the best thing that could ever happen for evangelism in America today
[time=1661] they were called by the apostle Paul and through him so are we to walk in the wisdom of God
[time=1667] secondly in verse five second little principle about our walk and this is where I think we
[time=1674] really fall down this is where I think we kind of lose it he says there at the end of
[time=1680] the verse making the most of the opportunity making the most of the opportunity now a lot
[time=1687] of times we say man you know I haven't had a lot of opportunity to share Christ I mean I'm just I just haven't had a lot of opportunity and we mean by that unsaved people don't come up and ask me how I got safe I mean I can't figure it I get involved in these conversations with the unsaved people and they don't say to me how did you come to Christ they don't bring up questions about God they don't bring up questions about Jesus and about hell and about heaven and about the resurrection and so see I don't have many opportunities to share the gospel I mean this must be applying to somebody else this must be the people who have the gift of evangelism or this must be just for the apostles or special leaders no and say I don't get those opportunities well you might be interested to know that there is absolutely no room for that understanding in the context or the word itself this Greek
[time=1732] word here means to buy in the marketplace the word opportunity there in your text means to buy in the marketplace has a preposition and compound with it which intensifies it
[time=1742] it means that there are some really incredible buys out there there's some bargain shopping
[time=1748] to be had in this arena of evangelism it would be as if Myers just down the street here already
[time=1756] known for their low prices were to advertise hey now as of this Sunday we're selling everything
[time=1764] it's seventy five percent off now see if that were true you probably be here this morning for me to preach to you be down there with your credit cards and your checkbooks and all the money you could muster buying everything you could ever dream of because why the bargain is so phenomenal I mean where are we ever going to get an opportunity like this again
[time=1784] that's what that word mean it does not mean sitting there and waiting for somebody to come to ask you how you came to Christ it is saying you have got to seize the opportunities
[time=1793] that exist in and around you for the cause of Christ you say well what are those well
[time=1799] hold your place there if you wouldn't Colossians for income with me to Matthew chapter nine I'll show you the Lord's definition of a great opportunity I'll show you the Lord's definition of a great opportunity and I think you'll find that there is every little bit
[time=1814] as much opportunity in our day and age as there was in his it's just a matter of understanding what an opportunity is Matthew nine verse thirty six now keep in mind this is right in front
[time=1829] of Matthew 10 which is where he summons the 12 and then sends them out to do the great work of evangelism verse thirty six and seeing the multitudes he felt compassion for them
[time=1839] because they were distressed and downcast like sheep without a shepherd then he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few therefore beseech the
[time=1850] Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his field you say I don't see any opportunity there yeah you do look at verse thirty six again because they were distressed and downcast
[time=1861] like sheep without a shepherd there's your opportunity you see these particular people have been ravaged by their culture their culture a Jewish audience here had told them that
[time=1871] they could get to God if they would keep the external religious man made rules of Israel things that were far above and beyond what God had ever called for and they had tried and tried and tried and tried and tried and they had come to the conclusion that it was impossible to keep all those laws and all those rules and all those regulations and they were no closer to God today than they were ten years ago when they started the whole process and they were downcast and they were distressed the reality of their own condition
[time=1898] and separation before God as they had been victimized and ravaged by their own culture left them in a distressed and downcast condition and that is called opportunity and it is everywhere
[time=1908] around us the people of America are being ravaged by this culture and the people of America
[time=1916] though financially better off than any other group in the world have a deep inner sense of the loneliness and the lostness and the disparity of all the materialism can buy
[time=1928] the people of America are ravaged their hearts are heavy and their relationships are shallow
[time=1935] and their longing for satisfaction real meaningful true satisfaction and their homes are falling apart and their debt is accumulating and it all bears down on them with incredible weight
[time=1947] they are as distressed and downcast as any generation spiritually could be by opportunity
[time=1954] Paul does not mean the unsaved are beating down your door to talk with you about Christ he means the degree to which they have been ravaged by their world system and have a sense of being lost and alone and disillusioned and empty and hurting cash in on that 75% off
[time=1972] go on out there Satan has done a marvelous job orchestrating this world system and for
[time=1978] the Jew of old it was keep the law and get saved and for our people of our day there is no law and there is no God so don't worry about it live any way you want and it is absolutely
[time=1990] a debacle and so the opportunity is phenomenal go out there and buy them up with the blood
[time=1998] of Christ give them hope and offer them forgiveness and offer them the grace of God and offer
[time=2004] them the truth of God whereby they can have real purpose and real meaning in their life and in their existence there is a fire sale going on opportunity in the mind of Paul with
[time=2017] a different sort of thing opportunity and Paul wasn't sitting around waiting for people to come up to him and say man you are something how can I get your Christianity how can I have what you have in the book of Acts chapter 21 there is a big throng of people that are
[time=2032] trying to beat him to death and kill him and he stops him in the middle of it all and says wait a minute before you do that I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about my Savior and my Lord which is exactly what he did he was saved from that massacre in crowd by the authorities and went on trial before Felix and Felix was about ready to make sentence and he said before you do that I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about the living Lord Jesus Christ from there he went before Herod and before Herod could pronounce judgment on him he said before you do that Herod I had this one in a lifetime experience out there on the Damascus road and I'd like to tell you about it what she went on to do he had another opportunity in Acts chapter 16 when he was in the Philippian
[time=2074] jail and the earthquake occurred and he led the Philippian jailer in all of his household to Christ he had another opportunity later in his life when he was imprisoned in Rome and her house arrest and you remember at the end of the book of Philippians where he said the saints in Caesar's household greet you he spelled imprisonment opportunity because
[time=2094] they kept chaining a different guard to him every six hours over and over and over and over and over again and those who were the protected guard of Caesar's household and so
[time=2104] the gospel went from them into the household and now they were wide because there was opportunity a different definition of opportunity it's a real definition of opportunity Christ and
[time=2115] Paul are saying to us that our culture has been so ravaged and so torn up by the prince of the power of the air that the people have a sense and awareness that they don't have all they need and in that hurting lost condition you forge out and you buy those opportunities
[time=2132] up and Psalm 90 Moses said teach us to number our days that we may present to the heart
[time=2140] of wisdom teach us to number not our years not our months not our weeks teach us to number
[time=2148] our days oh God that we may present to the heart of wisdom that's how he said it I say
[time=2154] it this way time is short hell is hot and the stakes are high time is short hell is very
[time=2162] hot and the stakes are eternal that's called opportunity folks you have the message you
[time=2169] have the answer you have the indwelling Christ and the power of God within you and you have the direct commission and call of God and the promise of protection to penetrate that marketplace and buy up souls for the cause of Christ at no expense to you in the eternal sense only blessings and rewards price having been paid in full by the blood of Christ so
[time=2190] in verse five now back to Colossians 4 Paul is saying because Christ is sufficient and
[time=2196] as you remember that's the whole theme of this book Colossians is about the sufficiency of Christ because Christ is sufficient he is the image of the invisible God the first born of all creation and because it is in Christ Colossians 210 that you have been made complete reach the outsider walk in wisdom skillfully living God's truth as a regular way of life
[time=2219] and then seize the opportunities presented you by a culture that leaves its people distressed and down to give and to minister and to sacrifice your time and your talent and your treasure
[time=2230] to convince some people that you've been transformed by the power of the true and living God and that because of that transformation you actually care about them and want to be a part of their
[time=2241] life but that's not enough that is not enough verse six there's a second thing we've got
[time=2248] to do there's a second thing we've got to do let your speech always be with grace seasoned
[time=2257] as it were with salt so that you may know how you should respond to each person not
[time=2263] enough to live it it's not enough to walk it you've got to talk it you actually have
[time=2269] to open your mouth and articulate the truth of the person of Jesus Christ they're on the
[time=2275] outside remember they don't know what you know they don't understand the Bible like you
[time=2281] understand the Bible they can't reduce the cardinal truth of God's word down to this one simple notion that God reconciled the world to himself through Jesus Christ they don't
[time=2293] know that you ask him to reduce this thing down and it comes out as varied as they are people with one common denominator I got to be good enough to get into heaven it's got to go past the exemplary lifestyle the wonder of your home the wonder of your heart
[time=2309] of compassion and kindness the difference that you are in the workplace the fact that you are not given to wrath and anger and malice the fact that you don't participate in immorality it's got to go past that to the open clear articulation of the simple message of the
[time=2325] gospel now it's like a two basic points there in verse six number one let's your speech
[time=2333] always be with grace speak with grace speak with grace in general there should be an unbelievable
[time=2340] difference between what happens with your mouth and what happens with the outsider's mouth and that difference should be so stark and the contrast so real that it is inescapable
[time=2352] what do I mean by that Psalm 12 for the unsaved says this listen to this Psalm 12 for says this our lips are our own who is Lord over us you see they taunt the living God and they
[time=2366] say there is no one in charge of us and there is no one in charge of our lips we are the Lord of our own mouths and we will say anything we want to say I can't give you the references
[time=2378] this morning it take too long but if you were to chronicle the the stuff that comes out of the unbeliever's mouth here it is they're full of lust evil deceit cursing oppression lying perversity destruction vanity flattery foolishness babble madness verbosity idle talk false teaching plotting boasting hatred swearing filthy talking gossip that's the mark of an unregenerate mouth that's the mark of what comes out of a person who says who is over our lips we have no Lord they just spew that stuff out and it comes out in all
[time=2409] different shapes and sizes and forms and sometimes it sounds polite and sometimes it is polite but there's a wicked heart behind it and it's always for selfish gain the mouth of
[time=2420] the wicked stand totally apart from the mouth of the redeemed it's interesting in Romans 3 when Paul is wrapping up his description of the totally depraved condition of man without Christ he talks about the mouth he says this their throat is an open grave with
[time=2435] their tongues they keep deceiving the poison of asps is under their lips whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness what a strange progression he knows that man speaks out of
[time=2447] that which fills the heart and so it's almost as if it's coming up out of the heart and it goes past the throat first which is an open grave then over their tongues which keep deceiving
[time=2456] then the poison of asps out their lips and then says finally the mouth it's as if they're full of cursing and bitterness the insider it's not that way for the believer it's different
[time=2469] Psalm 14 excuse me 141 3 listen to this set a guard oh Lord over my mouth keep watch over
[time=2480] the door of my lips we have a totally different perspective don't we we know the stuff we're
[time=2486] capable of even in our redeemed condition with a new heart and a changed mind and a desire to live for the glory of God we know the kinds of things that can come out of our mouth and so instead of taunting the living God that he is not Lord over it we beg him to set guard over it and keep watch over the door of our lips that we might not say anything to disgrace him or the cause of Christ or the church of Christ or the people of Christ so the mouth
[time=2511] of the redeemed says these kinds of things a confession of sin a confession of Christ
[time=2517] the law of God the truth of God the praise of God the wisdom and kindness of God and best of all what comes out of the mouth of the redeemed the good news of God the gospel
[time=2527] itself this speech which is seasoned with grace is filled with grace and we have the
[time=2535] unspeakable privilege of proclaiming the person of Christ the good news and you say I can't
[time=2541] do that you know you got to be kidding me I don't know how to tell people about Jesus and I haven't had those classes and that's people that's like you need to do those kinds of things and your leaders need to do those kinds of things and special people need to do those kinds of things you can't expect me in the normal course of the affairs of my life to be interacting with people and communicating the gospel it's too technical I mean they ask me all kinds of difficult questions who is God and is there creation or is it evolution and how can you explain the flood and all I can I can't begin to even enter into those kinds of conversation well hold your finger there in Colossians 4 just one more time and
[time=2576] let's come to 1 Corinthians chapter 1 for a minute I've got some great news for you you know what God isn't interested in you being able to articulate the great apologetics of the faith that's what all that's called how do you make a defense of God how do you make a defense of the flood how do you make a defense of how could Christ be God a man at the same time that's all called apologetics and you know what that's good for believers only very rarely does it have any effect on unbelievers very rarely does it have any
[time=2601] effect on unbelievers you know what an unbeliever needs the foolishness of Christ the foolishness of Christ 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 21 for sense in the wisdom of God the world through
[time=2613] its wisdom did not come to God God was well pleased through the foolishness of the message
[time=2619] preached to save those who believe all over the New Testament Paul talks about how the fact he didn't come in the wisdom of men and with great eloquent speech he came in the
[time=2631] great simplicity of the simple message that Christ was crucified look again at verse 23
[time=2639] that's his message but we preach Christ crucified to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Gentiles
[time=2645] foolishness man it's almost scary isn't it it's almost scary all we're supposed to do
[time=2655] at the right time and in the right situation is tell people that Christ was crucified who's Christ the son of the living God why was he crucified because we have a sin problem we
[time=2666] have a sin problem and somebody had to pay the debt and he paid it when he was crucified now this as we'll see in a minute isn't licensed to just blurt out the gospel at every occasion
[time=2678] that's not what he's saying but at the same time he is saying that it is so simple and
[time=2685] so clear that anybody and everybody can say it that's why anybody and everybody who's a believer is supposed to be saying the simple pure truth that Christ was crucified let's
[time=2697] go back to Colossians 4 we hear in our minds the haunting question of Romans chapter 10
[time=2704] how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard how shall they believe in him whom
[time=2712] they have not heard implied answer is they won't you and I my friends you and I are the
[time=2721] ones that share the gospel we're the ones that open our mouths we're the ones that present
[time=2729] the truth there's a second point in in this verse and look at it with me if you will
[time=2742] seasoned with salt it says in verse 6 let your speech always be with grace seasoned
[time=2750] as it were with salt so that you may know how to respond to each person interesting little phrase seasoned with salt it's a figure of speech that means something entirely differently than that it does now when somebody says you now take what I'm about to say to you with a grain of salt what do they mean you can expect to hear some gossip you can expect to hear hearsay you may even expect to hear something which is not edifying which is on the shady
[time=2774] side of things and the implication is take what I'm going to say to you plus some salt and there's a preservative in it so it will totally corrupt you what I'm going to say now is shady that's not at all what it meant in the ancient world they have your speech
[time=2787] seasoned with grace meant that you were witty meant that you were able to give sparkling
[time=2793] conversation in other words you had just the right comment at just the right time a witty person knows how to say just the right thing at just the right time and that's the way it
[time=2804] comes into this particular text when you are interacting with the unsaved against the backdrop of a godly life that honors and glorifies him and you have opportunity to speak the simplicity
[time=2815] of the message of Christ season it with salt give just as much as is needed be sensitive
[time=2822] to the situation itself I was driving to Warsaw this week and I noticed this man out there
[time=2830] on highway 30 I mean in the middle of nowhere in between nowhere and nowhere he's out there walking and he's got this huge eight foot cross and on the tail end of the thing it's stuck in a little cart with wheels on it and then there's a pad right at the cross itself and he drapes that over his shoulder and there was something written on the side of the cross it didn't quite catch it as I was driving by probably you know for God's love the world or something and this is his deal see this is how he is going to tell the world about Jesus I don't think that's at all what the Lord had in mind it was for somebody to walk from one side of the country to the other side of the country bearing his cross and proclaiming that Jesus died for their sins that is missing this critical component of having it seasoned
[time=2871] as it were with salt notice verse six so that you may know how you should respond to each
[time=2877] person I don't think that means that when you're going shopping with an unsafe person you season your your conversation with salt by saying boy I hope the Lord provides a parking place for us or you're out at the ball field and your son and others are playing there
[time=2892] and you say my didn't the Lord give those little ones strength to play today as if every word
[time=2898] has to have a Bible verse stuck in there somewhere and you use these and vows and speak in the old English and I don't think that's at all what this means this doesn't mean that you you sound odd or peculiar to your outsider it is the opposite of that they are getting
[time=2913] truth in terms that they completely understand and they're not getting too much truth at
[time=2921] any particular moment it is the great skill that we saw evidenced in the life of our Lord
[time=2927] make a study some time of the Lord's mouth and how he used it Luke 4 22 says this and all were speaking well of him and wondering at the gracious words which were falling from
[time=2938] his lips now he astounded the people of his day because he taught things out of the Old Testament that no one had any way to know because they were mysteries that he was himself revealing but there was another component of his speech which was just unbelievably gracious
[time=2953] imagine perfect speech and being around perfect speech always having the right thing to say at the right he put people in awe of his ability to talk not communicate not preach as much
[time=2963] but just interact with people in John 6 63 he says this the words that I have spoken to
[time=2970] you are spirit and life because he did teach them the truth the gospel it says of him in
[time=2976] 1 Peter 2 22 who committed no sin nor was any deceit found in his mouth he had an absolutely
[time=2982] unbelievable mouth and it astounded the people it was always seasoned with salt it was always
[time=2988] appropriate to the individual need think of it his words of evangelism were insightful
[time=2994] and confrontive to the woman at the well his words of evangelism were intellectual and jolting to Nicodemus his words of evangelism were penetrating and hard to the rich young
[time=3005] ruler his words of evangelism were harsh and judgmental to the scribes and the Pharisees
[time=3012] while his words of evangelism were soft and forgiving to the woman caught an adultery always
[time=3019] having the right words for the right situation always imparting the right amount of truth with the right tone and the right spirit at the right way in every case our Lord's mouth
[time=3030] was seasoned as it were with salt and he always knew how to respond to each person and we
[time=3037] are to be like Christ we are to be like Christ we are to pursue that and strive for that
[time=3045] and try to develop and cultivate that ability in our lives well as we draw this thing to
[time=3051] a close no stronger call to personal evangelism could be made than these two verses no possible
[time=3058] stronger call to personal evangelism could be made and it wraps this book up hold your place there come to the first chapter of the book remember where we started do you remember where we started in this great defense of the sufficiency of Christ we didn't get lost in all kinds of details about the kenosis and who Christ is and how the deity works we started with the gospel look at verse five because of the hope laid up for you in heaven of what you previously heard in word of truth the gospel if you remember that whole passage
[time=3088] there he talks in verse four about the faith of the gospel and the love of the gospel and the hope of the gospel in verse six the fruit of the gospel and the grace of God and truth of the gospel it's all about the gospel in verses nine to fourteen he talks about the
[time=3103] great prayer of the gospel being filled with the knowledge of his will there in verse nine in verse 15 he talks about the person of the gospel that's Christ the image of the invisible God verse 15 verse 16 for by him all things were created verse 17 in him all things hold
[time=3118] together and then you remember the peace of the gospel in verse 20 having been reconciled
[time=3124] to him having made peace through the blood of his cross he comes now having started with
[time=3131] that incredible dissertation and explanation and lifting up of the power and the wonder
[time=3137] of the gospel at first to defend the person of Jesus Christ but now as we close this book
[time=3144] back to chapter four you remember last week Paul's prayer is that all people please prayer for me that God in verse two would open to us a door for the word so that I may speak
[time=3156] forth the mystery of Christ for which I have been in prison in order that I may make it clear in the way that I ought to speak there's his passion pray for me that I'll be able
[time=3166] to do that and then in verses five and six he says and you do it to you do it to the
[time=3172] all sufficiency of Christ made clear through the power of your life through the seizing of opportunity as you speak with grace seasoned as it were with salt you ask yourself how
[time=3186] is God planning to win people to Christ you say what is his strategy for evangelism to
[time=3193] reach the outsider and the answer it's a one word answer it's you it is you and it's
[time=3200] me that's all we've got that's all he put in place the powerful persuasive effective
[time=3208] life that you would live and the preaching of the gospel that you would bring is his only plan of course that is all in the context of the local church and the power of the redeemed
[time=3219] working together in that but never never for a minute divorce yourself from this process
[time=3226] and that's what I want to say just in closing I want to remind you something and then invite you by way of application to do something but by way of reminder listen to me now do not think for a minute that you can be healthy in your Christian life without this dynamic working don't don't think that evangelism is for those people who have the gift of evangelism
[time=3247] it's never even listed anywhere in the New Testament except in Ephesians four and that's talking about pastors and teachers and evangelists everybody's called to evangelize and that's
[time=3258] because God wants all of us involved in that for his glory for the sake of the outsider and for your sake you see there are dynamics that must occur inside your Christianity one
[time=3268] of them is time in God's Word one of them is time in prayer one of them is confession of sin one of them is loving the believers in your life and one of them is reaching out
[time=3278] to the outsider and you strip that part you pull that piece of the puzzle out and you are incomplete and what will happen is there'll be things in your life that you'll be struggling
[time=3290] with things outside of evangelism and you'll think the whole problem begins and ends right there with that one little problem and it there is good reason to address it or them
[time=3303] but if you leave unattended this other dynamic of evangelism in your life you rob yourself
[time=3310] of the power and the resources and the dynamics which Christ built into the full orb of an individual Christians experience and you may never gain victory over here not because you're not looking at that but because you're not looking at this you have been built for this
[time=3326] you have been saved for this you've been redeemed for this now you're saying okay okay okay okay
[time=3333] I get it but I'm still scared of death and I'm still very busy and my priorities are still going in the wrong direction and it's very unlikely that just because you talk to me about this today even though I agree with everything you say oh I agree with everything you say it's unlikely that I am going to go out and do anything about it now if that's
[time=3353] you and you're saying I want to change I believe I should change but I don't think I can change just because you told me to change go outside and before you get to the outside stop in the foyer and sign up for living proof a 13 week curriculum we're going to offer it in the
[time=3368] summer sign up for it it is the best material that we know of to train you how to do this
[time=3378] and to help you with all all the stuff we've covered in here is in there and I'll say it to you again don't allow yourself don't allow yourself to live a Christian life that does
[time=3389] not have this as a vital regular part of your existence you are robbing yourself of incredible
[time=3396] joy robbing yourself of power and strength that comes when that begins to occur well
[time=3406] there's never a better opportunity to accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior
[time=3412] than right now you've been listening to this message you've been understanding that God has a heart for you he is calling other believers to move into your life you sense that you're
[time=3423] on the outside looking in and you don't like it out there you want to be made right with God and have your eternal destiny secure forgiven for sin and feel the love of God in your life
[time=3433] every day you can have that by accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and
[time=3439] I'm going to bow for a word of prayer and if you do the same what I pray out loud you pray quietly in your heart to God and if you meet it from your heart God will hear you and forgive you for your sins and give you Christ as your Savior I invite you to pray with me Father I know that I'm a sinner I know that I'm on the outside looking in and it doesn't feel good I don't want to be out here anymore I confess my sin to you and I put my faith in the person of Jesus Christ as my Savior as the one who died for my sins
[time=3469] in my place that I might live that I might be forgiven for my sins and be given eternal life thank you for the forgiveness in Christ I pray these things in Jesus name amen well
