[time=0] And the message is this, moving ahead, the kingdom of God is not about one individual,
[time=8] it's not just about a superstar.
[time=11] God has a place for each and every person, he has a place for you.
[time=15] It is not a cookie cutter Christianity, as you'll notice as we move through this text, there is diversity, there is individuality, there are all shapes and sizes of people that
[time=25] come out of this text and the message is God is in need of you and your part and the place
[time=32] that you have in the kingdom of God.
[time=34] You are important to me, says God to you this morning through this text.
[time=44] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=48] We're glad you've joined us today.
[time=49] Pastor Moore has a challenging message for us and you'll want to stay tuned.
[time=53] Right now, let's begin our service.
[time=83] [MUSIC - 110 seconds]
[time=213] [APPLAUSE]
[time=217] We'll return to our service in just a moment, but right now, I'd like to tell you about our special gift from the Bible Hour, a lovely digital desk clock with an inspiring picture of two climbers forging up a mountain side and the inscription together, we achieve the
[time=233] extraordinary.
[time=235] This handsome teamwork digital desk clock is our free gift to you when you write to the Bible Hour.
[time=241] Stay tuned, I'll be giving you our address at the end of the program.
[time=254] Living in the spotlight is strange, the world seems to know your future has changed.
[time=264] When people stop by, to give you advice, they find excuses to walk away.
[time=273] If only you could trade what's been said for the help of one, depend on the world.
[time=284] Actions speak louder than hearts, and no Sunday, you are loved when it comes to the love of
[time=298] man.
[time=299] He doesn't have to say a word, his actions speak louder, whole matter, matter than
[time=311] the words.
[time=315] If you need a reason for faith, there's someone who chose to stand in your place.
[time=332] Just picture this sound, and it is your life was buried under the grief and pain.
[time=341] It's time for you to face what you're worth, to the one who died, to put your heart forth.
[time=351] Actions speak louder than hearts, and no Sunday, you are loved when it comes to the love of
[time=366] man.
[time=371] He doesn't have to say a word, his actions speak louder, whole matter, matter than
[time=378] the words.
[time=380] When all of you are losing here, it's because he's done the same for me.
[time=389] When I share your tears, remember he cried with us on a rather treat.
[time=402] Actions speak louder than hearts, and no Sunday, you are loved when it comes to the love of
[time=418] man.
[time=420] He doesn't have to say a word, his actions speak louder, whole matter, matter than
[time=433] the words, his actions speak louder, whole matter, whole matter, whole matter, matter
[time=468] matter.
[time=469] Hi, my name is Russell Moore, and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=473] Well, we're approaching the wonderful part of the year when we get to remember and celebrate really the freedom and
[time=480] the independence that we have here in the United States of America.
[time=483] The Fourth of July is fast upon us, and we're so thankful, as I know you are as well, to be privileged to live here in this
[time=492] country, and in this time, and to enjoy the freedoms, and enjoy the liberties.
[time=496] I was with a friend the other day who said America gives you the freedom to fail, and wrapped up in that as the wonder of
[time=502] striving to be more than you are.
[time=505] America allows the freedom to try to lift yourself up and do better.
[time=509] Well, we're going to celebrate the wonder of all that freedom on July 2nd, here at Blackhawk Baptist Church,
[time=515] and what we call our patriotic celebration.
[time=518] That's a Sunday, July 2nd, at ten o'clock in the morning.
[time=522] It'll be a tremendous time with patriotic music and a message, even from God's Word, about freedom in Christ,
[time=529] and all that it means to celebrate the wonder of freedom here in America.
[time=533] Well, now let's go back to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=536] [MUSIC]
[time=543] Holy is Steve, the Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise.
[time=550] We worship Him only, faithful and just.
[time=555] Mighty Creator, holy is, holy is Steve.
[time=562] Holy is Steve, O let us adore Him, lift up His name.
[time=569] We bow down before Him, righteous and just.
[time=574] High and exalted, holy is Steve.
[time=578] Holy is Steve.
[time=583] He reigns on high, with strength and compassion.
[time=588] Barugar on high, faithful companions.
[time=593] Here it in light, light there the lasting.
[time=598] Holy is Steve, holy is Steve.
[time=607] The Lord God Almighty, worthy of praise.
[time=612] We worship Him only, love you of truth.
[time=617] Father of mercy, holy is, holy is Steve.
[time=623] Holy is Steve.
[time=630] He is unchanged, God of our fathers.
[time=635] Cry out His name, He faithfully answers.
[time=640] [MUSIC - 53 seconds]
[time=726] Let me invite you to come to Colossians chapter 4, and today we come to the last passage
[time=741] in the book of Colossians, and we'll speak our last message on it, at least in this study of the book.
[time=748] Looking forward to the summer months here, I think we'll be studying Joseph, the character and life of Joseph in the morning throughout the summer months, and then when we come to the fall, we'll start the book of Matthew together and study that.
[time=760] But this morning we come to these closing 12 verses, and in these 12 verses, you're going
[time=766] to find nine different people listed here.
[time=770] This is the portion of the book, nobody even bothers to read, much less preach on, it's the kind of passage that when you make that commitment to read the whole Bible in a year, and you come there to Genesis 10 and begin these long genealogies that so-and-so beget, so-and-so beget, so-and-so, you kind of skip.
[time=785] Well this morning we're going to kind of take a look at this, and I think with a little closer examination than just a reading, I'm hoping you'll find yourself in this passage this morning.
[time=795] In fact, I'm hoping that you will sense how much you mean to God as a result of looking
[time=801] at this passage, because there is a tremendous power here that results in community, because
[time=808] people are standing together.
[time=810] Paul is in Rome at this particular writing, and he has gathered around him through the Spirit of God and just these hearts of these people, a whole bunch of folks that are ministering to him and helping him minister to other people.
[time=823] And so we learn here the power of community.
[time=825] The New Testament Church at this particular point in time is on the move, people are coming to Christ, people are being transformed, lives are changing as a result of what Paul and this entourage of people are accomplishing.
[time=838] People are saying no to immorality and to impurity and to greed.
[time=842] People are changing the way they relate with people, from anger and malice and slander to humility and kindness and patience.
[time=850] Wives are being loved in an unusual and peculiar way because the gospel has come in to a man's heart and he's starting to cherish and love.
[time=858] And husbands are starting to change the way they relate to their kids and not exasperate them.
[time=864] People are being put back together, it's just a tremendous thing that's emerging here.
[time=869] And the tendency is to think that it's all because of Paul, because he's the great apostle, he's the one that's charting new territory.
[time=877] But this morning I think as you meet these nine people you meet the supporting cast as it were.
[time=883] In fact there are over a hundred different people, whether by direct reference or in general, without naming them, that Paul references in the New Testament, a hundred of them.
[time=893] You can read about twenty-six of them in Romans 16, nine of them show up here.
[time=898] And the message in this passage is this, it's not about being a superstar, the kingdom of God doesn't move ahead just because there's one super hyper-committed gifted individual.
[time=908] The kingdom of God moves ahead even in light of someone as remarkably gifted as Paul is
[time=914] because there's a group of people called the community, called the church, called the body of Christ and in the diversity and in the individuality and in the plurality of all of
[time=925] these individuals that is how God moves his kingdom one person at a time step by step forward
[time=931] and advancing into the kingdom of darkness.
[time=934] God is saying to you this morning, you are important to me and I will transform people's
[time=941] lives through the corporate work of the body of Christ.
[time=947] So let's look at these twelve verses and meet the kinds of people that God uses to advance
[time=953] the kingdom of God.
[time=954] We're going to meet the kinds of people that God uses to advance the kingdom of God.
[time=959] The first one, in verse seven, a man by the name of Tychicus, there you see diversity already, I mean with a name like that, it's a one or even God in the list.
[time=969] Verse seven, as to all my affairs, Tychicus, the C.H. is pronounced as a K, a beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond servant and the Lord will bring you information.
[time=979] For I have sent him to you for this very purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts.
[time=987] We only read his name five times in the New Testament and each time it's a very brief bit of information we gather.
[time=994] But as we piece his life together, we learn that this man has a servant's heart.
[time=999] The first kind of person God uses is one with a servant's heart.
[time=1004] We come across Tychicus in Acts 20 for the very first time and his name appears on a list of other Gentile believers.
[time=1011] And Paul at this time has a plan in his mind.
[time=1014] The church in Jerusalem is suffering, it's suffering persecution, it's suffering from a famine, it's a desperate need.
[time=1020] And so Paul is moving in and around Macedonia and he is collecting finances, resources,
[time=1026] it's a giving project, it's a fundraising drive if you will and Paul is going to bring these resources back to the church at Jerusalem, one because they have financial need.
[time=1035] But far more importantly than that, he's calling them the unity, he's trying to get the Gentile church and the Jewish Christian church to work together and to feel the unity that they ought to feel inside the body of Christ.
[time=1047] But it's hard for them because it's changed and these Gentiles have been the outsiders and you know how hard it is to accept new people.
[time=1054] And so Paul figures he'll bring money but he'll also bring people like Tychicus, he'll
[time=1060] bring not only the finances but the people of the expression of that love, Gentiles back with him to Jerusalem and they'll get the message that way, here's our money and by the way here's a few of the Gentiles and they extend their love to you.
[time=1072] They were willing to make this long trek through and traveling that day and age was incredibly difficult and you could die at any moment and you get sick at any moment, just read the book of Acts and you'll find that out.
[time=1083] And these guys are willing to extend the message of love and come and leave home and leave friends and leave job and interrupt the schedule of their life to a very tangible way say to that church in Jerusalem we love you.
[time=1095] That's the heart of a servant and that's what Tychicus is doing here.
[time=1100] We meet him a little later on and we see him reference both in the book of Titus and in the books of Timothy because Paul is sending Tychicus to be an intrampaster first on the
[time=1112] island of Crete because he wants Titus the pastor there to come be with him.
[time=1117] And so the servant Tychicus says sure I'll go be an intrampaster.
[time=1120] A little bit later on in his life Paul says would you do the same for me at Ephesus and Tychicus says absolutely I'll go spot for Timothy so Timothy can come and minister to you and you to him.
[time=1132] He'll do anything that Paul wants him to do and we never find an argument, we never find a problem, we never find him disagreeable, he's always just the faithful servant.
[time=1141] And what he'll do in this space of time where he is now surrounding Paul the Roman imprisonment Paul's writing Colossians, Ephesians and Philemon and Tychicus is the one who delivers them all.
[time=1151] That's tremendous privilege.
[time=1153] I mean imagine the spiritual warfare that's going on as Paul completes these letters imagine the demonic hosts that would love to intervene and keep from arriving these three powerful letters which change those churches and which have taught the church through all of history.
[time=1167] And Tychicus the faithful servant's heart just doing what he's asked to do reliably and faithfully with a God honoring attitude gets the incredible privilege of carrying these letters to their destinations.
[time=1180] Paul trusted him.
[time=1182] Look at the description of him again he calls him three things, verse seven, he is first of all my beloved brother meaning he's a true born again brother and I love him from my heart.
[time=1193] He is secondly my faithful servant and we've already seen that he just did anything Paul wanted to do and thirdly he's a fellow bond servant in the Lord and Paul there acknowledges that the service of Tychicus is really to the Lord Jesus Christ it just happens to get
[time=1208] its flushing out through the administration of Paul.
[time=1213] Tremendous man God uses people with a servant's heart and if that's all you've got if you're
[time=1219] not spectacular if you're not marvelous and wonderful in some other terms if you've just got a faithful heart and you'll just do what you're asked to do inside the kingdom of God who knows the extent and the degree to which God will end up using you.
[time=1234] Meet Onesimus in verse nine number two, Onesimus he says there and with him I'm going to send Tychicus and I'm going to send Onesimus our faithful and beloved brother who is one of
[time=1246] your number they will inform you about the whole situation what does he mean one of your number?
[time=1253] Well clearly it means that Onesimus comes out of the church at Colossae and what we learn from Onesimus is that God uses people with a sinful past.
[time=1264] Onesimus has a terribly sinful past he did come out of Colossae in fact he was owned
[time=1270] as a slave Philemon was the slave owner and the church of Colossae met in the house of
[time=1276] Philemon.
[time=1278] Onesimus before his conversion still is an unregenerant man doesn't want to be a slave anymore so he runs away and he runs as far away from Colossae as he can get and I imagine as he's embarking on this journey to Rome and who knows you know what kind of cover he had to go under and what he had to steal to find money to get there in fact it implies he stole money even from Philemon to make the journey he's figuring I'll be a nobody a no-name I'll get lost in Rome I'll find my opportunity and I'll be a free man and he runs smack dab into the Apostle Paul who promptly leads him to the Lord and now Onesimus
[time=1312] a fugitive a person who is under the law worthy of death for his running away from Philemon
[time=1318] is now a born-again believer and Paul says about him in the book of Philemon speaking to Philemon about Onesimus I appeal to you for my child in other words Paul saying I just led this guy to the Lord whom I have begotten in my imprisonment Onesimus who formerly was
[time=1334] useless to you because he had obviously run away and you never find him again but now is useful to you and to me you see Onesimus came to a place of repentance he accepted Christ
[time=1344] as his Lord and Savior and the work of transformation began to work in his life and his Paul discipled him Onesimus recognized that it was his responsibility to go back to Philemon himself a believer
[time=1355] now both of them the master and the slave saved but still uncertain of his faint Philemon
[time=1362] didn't have to forgive him for that Philemon could have put him to death Philemon could have penalized him in any way possible all of that was legal inside of that system but
[time=1373] you see he repented and so Onesimus is now going back to Philemon in the church at Colossae
[time=1380] and again in Philemon Paul says as I send you Onesimus I am sending you my heart he said
[time=1386] later I wish to keep him with me that he might minister to me in my imprisonment here
[time=1392] a fugitive comes to Christ and becomes useful to the cause of Christ personally ministering to the Apostle Paul God uses people with a sinful past and maybe you're here this morning
[time=1404] and maybe you have a very checkered past and maybe you've got some things in your closet and maybe very few people know about them and you're feeling that because of what happened in your past God cannot use you in the present and my friends listen to the testimony of Onesimus
[time=1421] Onesimus is transformed by the power of God when he comes to Christ and Christ uses him as if he had never done anything wrong in his past at all I've told you about my past how horribly sinful it is God brought me to Christ and now he uses me the chairman of my board at the church I had in Los Angeles was a former hell's angel I mean he would
[time=1440] tell me stories of all kinds of drugs and murders and killings and and rapes and I mean
[time=1446] unbelievable stuff chairman of the board of elders in my church see God is in the business
[time=1453] of using people with a sinful past Paul's past Paul was a murderer there's nothing strange
[time=1462] about that he says to the church at Corinth such were some of you you see that's the
[time=1468] great message of Christianity such were some of you goes on to say but you were washed
[time=1474] but you were sanctified but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what were they doing they were fornicators they were adulterers they were homosexuals they were thieves they were drunkards you name it they were doing it then they came to Christ and then God used them one of the early church fathers a man by the name of Ignatia later
[time=1495] writes a letter to the church of Colossae and he mentions Onesimus he says this quote
[time=1502] since then in the name of God I receive your entire congregation meaning I receive the
[time=1508] congregation of Colossae in the person of Onesimus a man of inexpressible love and your
[time=1516] pastor I beseech you in Christ to love him and all that are like him now we can't be
[time=1522] dogmatic because it's church history it's not the Bible itself but there's every reason to believe that Onesimus was not only forgiven by Philemon but eventually became a pastor
[time=1533] or the pastor of the church at Colossae God is in the business of using people with
[time=1540] this sinful path number three meet Aristarchus Aristarchus in verse 10 it says there Aristarchus
[time=1549] my fellow prisoner send you his greetings and also Barnabas cousin Mark whom we'll get
[time=1555] to in a minute fellow prisoner why does he get that title where does Aristarchus get the
[time=1562] title felt well listen if you were to go back and you were to read Acts chapter 19 you would see this mob riot going on in the city of Ephesus what had happened there is Paul had
[time=1573] ministered there for about two and a half years and his ministry was so fruitful I mean it was unbelievable the numbers of people that were coming to Christ not only there but in the surrounding areas as they got word of his ministry in Ephesus that it was destroying
[time=1587] the silver smith trade of Ephesus which was very lucrative because the temple Diana was there and people would come into Ephesus and they'd buy these trinkets these silver trinkets and they would do their worship as they would leave Ephesus or in the homes of Ephesus when they couldn't actually be in the temple and these guys were making a killing until Paul shows up and so many people get saved that the demand for that product has dropped and
[time=1610] they can't stand the thought of it any longer and they know that if they let Paul keep doing this thing they'll be out of business and so they orchestrate a riot and they're really trying to get Paul lynched and mobbed and murdered right there on the spot but for by the providence of God Paul when the riot breaks out isn't in the immediate proximity to the thing but
[time=1628] they're in such a frenzy they grab Aristarchus and another man named Gaius who were known to be the friends of Paul because they couldn't get Paul they at least got his friends and
[time=1639] Paul of course wanted to rush in and defend them but his friends wouldn't let him and you know all that story as that goes on but the point is this do you realize that we find Aristarchus imprisoned because of that there then we see him imprisoned in Jerusalem and
[time=1653] now he's in Rome and we're not sure if he's imprisoned here or not maybe he's just along as a supporter but it's quite possible that from the time he identified with Paul at Ephesus
[time=1665] until this time he had never left Paul's side and may have been imprisoned the entire time having never committed a crime having never done anything wrong except having Paul as your friend that's all he did but he you'll notice he never stopped being Paul's friend
[time=1682] he never allowed the adversity of being Paul's friend to drive him out of Paul's life God uses people who are loyal and faithful my friends and you may say what's my contribution around here and how am I supposed to get all this done just be a loyal faithful friend find
[time=1698] those people who are out there on the front edge and who are cutting it a little thin and who are out in the battle and just be their faithful loyal supportive friend and
[time=1708] stick with them through thick and thin God uses people like that Aristarchus mark number
[time=1714] four our fourth person we meet is by the name of mark and you can find him in verse 10 middle
[time=1720] of the verse he is Barnabas's cousin about whom you received instructions if he comes
[time=1726] to you welcome him as well now from mark we learn that God uses people with past failure
[time=1737] in Christian service now this Mark's failure came after he came to Christ Mark's failure
[time=1744] came after he learned and accepted Christ as Savior this is a guy that fell in ministry
[time=1750] and God is using him then you remember that story mark had the chance of a lifetime he
[time=1756] got to go with Paul on the first missionary journey because he was Barnabas's cousin and Barnabas and Paul were going to go off and do this great thing and he was allowed to tag along and it was an absolutely thrilling event in his life on tell about midway of
[time=1769] missionary journey number one when they had to kind of change directions and head into some regions that were very dangerous and played with thievery and you could get murdered
[time=1778] up in these mountains on your way to a new destination and mark just turn tail and ran home he split he went back to Jerusalem and Paul considered it desertion so much so was
[time=1790] Paul aggravated by it that when they started out on missionary journey to Barnabas said let's bring mark along and Paul said I'll have nothing to do with that man we're not doing him again he already quit and deserted once we're not going to give him a chance to do that a second time X 15 36 but Paul kept insisting that they should not take him along who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work I mean
[time=1813] Paul was done with the guy I've had enough this guy's a coward he quit he walked away and he didn't go on and do the work that God called him to do we're not going to give him a second chance well by God's grace and through the ties of family Barnabas said okay
[time=1828] then I'm going with mark and we're going to go over here and Paul said fine I'll get Silas and we'll go over here and there's this big rift I don't know what you think it's like to be branded by the Apostle Paul as a deserter but I got to believe that you're pretty much done except with family members under that condition in the New Testament church I mean he was Paul was the king Kahuna and when he says you deserve it and you're out you're out 11 or 12 years later we get his name right here and we get a little more
[time=1857] than that over in Philemon the other book he wrote at the same time we see Paul calling Mark a fellow worker Philemon 24 and what's really exciting is that in 2 Timothy 411 now
[time=1871] you realize that 2 Timothy is the last book that Paul ever wrote he is now long past this event and he is nearing his death and he says this in 2 Timothy 411 about Mark he says only
[time=1883] Luke is with me writing to Timothy pick up Mark and bring him with you for he is useful
[time=1890] to me for service so somehow or another in that 11 or 12 or 13 15 year time span Mark
[time=1898] found his way back into the good graces of the Apostle Paul and was meriting this phrase he is useful to me for service somehow he restored trust somehow he proved his character
[time=1910] to be honorable and as you know later wrote the gospel of Mark God is in the business of
[time=1917] using people even if they failed at some point after they came to Christ you're not done
[time=1923] that doesn't throw you out of the whole deal he goes from being a deserter a dropout having
[time=1930] Paul disassociate himself with him but God is the God of second chances now we don't know
[time=1938] for sure how that happened but there's a good indication that Mark ran into another guy
[time=1944] who had also fallen while in the ministry and got restored Peter because it says in first
[time=1953] Peter 513 my son Mark kind of these closing comments again and Peter makes reference to
[time=1959] my son Mark and there's there's every reason to believe that somehow in that 15 year period
[time=1965] Peter knowing full well what it was like to bomb out in the ministry on the first effort
[time=1971] than I'm the Lord having to sit there on the edge of the sea there and the Lord saying do you love me do you love me do you love me feed my sheep and get restored himself by the Lord Peter runs over to Mark and says hey we can do this I've gone through this I can help you we can get you back on your feet and so God using Peter probably and his own cousin
[time=1990] Barnabas puts Mark back on his feet and we learned the invaluable lesson that God is in
[time=1996] the business of using people even though they failed him after they've come to Christ don't
[time=2002] sit on the sidelines if that's you don't think you're done if that's you don't think God has no place for you in the advancement of his kingdom because he gave you a chance and you messed it up and you've been somehow branded by some person or something jump back in you
[time=2017] may need to find a mentor but jump back in and find your place inside this list of people
[time=2023] who are counted as those that ministered the gospel number five this next guy we know next
[time=2030] to nothing about verse 11 Jesus who is called justice that's it that's all we know Jesus
[time=2037] who is called justice now obviously he had justice thrown in there to make sure he wasn't confused with the other Jesus the real Jesus the big Jesus the God Jesus justice means righteous
[time=2048] that's quite a name to live up to I am Jesus the righteous or what do we know about him
[time=2055] I mean just by way of this one little verse look at it Jesus who is called justice verse
[time=2061] 11 there are only the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision
[time=2068] they have proved to be an encouragement to me what we know about him is that he along with these these others that are named just above him these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision what's that mean they were raised Jews they
[time=2084] come out of Judaism and so from the life of justice at least we can learn this that God
[time=2091] is in the business of using people who are willing to leave their family and the culture
[time=2097] and the way they grew up behind in response to the call of God that's exactly what he did he had to leave his culture he had to leave his family he had to leave all that it was familiar he had to leave his comfort zone and follow after Jesus Christ as he ministered to this man by the name of Paul that's always the way it is right Abraham in Hebrews 11
[time=2119] it says this by faith Abraham when he was called obeyed by going out to a place where
[time=2127] he was to receive an inheritance but then it says he lived as an alien in the land of
[time=2133] promise dwelling in tents but you know about Abraham he grew up in Err his father was
[time=2139] a false teacher or a priest in a false religious system he knew all about that religious system
[time=2147] his dad was a leader in it their family was probably prominent it was familiar it was comfortable it made sense he knew who he was he knew where he was going in life all those questions resolved through tradition and God says you follow me you come with me somewhere
[time=2164] where you don't know anything about the place then all your family means nothing and all of your traditions mean nothing and all you grew up with is nothing anymore you come where you are a stranger and an alien and follow me and Abraham said okay I'll do that that's
[time=2180] why he's listed in that chapter he's a man of great faith Moses did the exact same thing Moses by the privilege of God raised in the household of Pharaoh it says there in Hebrews 11 by faith Moses when he had grown up refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to endure ill treatment with the people of God Moses had all the privilege any land could have and his was the most powerful of all the lands of all the earth he was educated
[time=2205] and well dressed and wealthy and well fed and cared for and could have administration of major parts of Pharaoh's kingdom a very capable man but God had a mission for him and so he
[time=2217] set his culture and his family and his familiar surroundings and all the advantages by birth set them aside and walked away and chosen steady ill treatment with the people of God
[time=2228] God uses people like that that's called being available available to your own hurt available
[time=2234] to live in light of eternity available to live for something better as the people of Hebrews 11 were doing a better country not made with hands the city whose architect and builder is God that is a characteristic of the kinds of people that God uses what about a paphras
[time=2252] number six here a paphras in verse 12 here's a remarkable individual a paphras who is
[time=2262] one of your number again okay so he comes out of the church of Colossae a bond slave of Jesus
[time=2268] Christ sends you his greetings always laboring earnestly for you and his prayers that you may
[time=2274] stand perfect and fully assured in the will of God you know who a paphras was a paphras was the
[time=2281] pastor of the church at Ephesus you can read about him in chapter one verse seven just as you learned it from a paphras what is the it the gospel in other words Paul basically never left
[time=2292] Ephesus the reason that the gospel got the Colossae and the reason that there's a church in
[time=2298] Colossae at that particular time is because a paphras had heard the gospel from Paul and taught it to the Colossians so a paphras is the pastor of this church it meets in the home of Philemon
[time=2310] but a paphras is broken hearted over the condition of his church because as you've studied these last many months you know that this church is under attack false teachers are coming and they're
[time=2321] saying Christ isn't sufficient they're saying we need to add legalism and we need to add mysticism and we need to add human philosophy and we need to add all this stuff because Christ isn't really enough and a paphras knows that that's wrong but he doesn't have a New Testament that he can figure out why so he leaves he too is willing to make this long arduous journey to Rome and he comes
[time=2344] with a pastor's heart and he says Paul I don't know what to do Paul says what's going on he says man we got these guys and they're smart and they're clever and they're telling our people that Christ is not sufficient for their salvation and our people are getting lost into asceticism and mysticism
[time=2360] and human philosophy and legalism then the church is going to fall apart and the purity and the
[time=2366] centrality of the person of Jesus Christ is going to be obscured what do I do Paul says I'll tell
[time=2372] you what you do he got on his pen and he got on his parchment and he began to write the book of Colossians it's because of a it's because of a paphras and his faithful ministry there and his
[time=2383] shepherding heart to guard against the savage wolves that enter in to the flock and he says not my flock
[time=2390] when he runs with the only source of authority he knows the person of Paul and says will you please
[time=2396] help us and so is given the book of Colossians it's a long trip though it's a long way to Rome
[time=2405] and if you're once there you probably spend some time with Paul because you learn all you can and then it's a long trip home so what does he do while he's away from his flock look at verse 12 what's he doing every morning every night every noon all the time he's always laboring earnestly
[time=2420] for you and his prayers that you may stand perfect and fully assured in the will of God
[time=2427] you know we learn from a paphras that God uses people who care about other people's spiritual
[time=2434] development and growth you may not care about much you may not care about much but if you will just
[time=2441] care about other people's spiritual well-being enough to labor for their spiritual growth enough
[time=2448] to pray for their spiritual growth the word labor earnestly means it's an athletic word meaning agonize he would wear himself out he would strain himself as an athlete would an athletic contest
[time=2460] in this endeavor of prayer and if I can't be with you and shepherd your spiritual health then I'll just pray up a storm that God will look at at the end of verse 12 perfect and fully persuade you of
[time=2471] the will of God if I can't be there to help the process man I'm gonna pray up a storm that God
[time=2477] will do that in your life my beloved Colossians God uses people like that God uses people you don't need a position you don't need a title you don't
[time=2487] need a seminary degree you don't need a title in this church all you have to be is a person who cares about other people's spiritual well-being enough to pray for it agonize in prayer for do something about it number seven Luke we know a lot about Luke verse 14 he's the beloved physician
[time=2510] and he sends you his greetings you know we learn from the life of Luke
[time=2517] God uses people who give God their profession give God your profession give God your
[time=2527] vocation you don't have to be a doctor you may be a skilled laborer whatever you do you may be a salesman give your vocation to God like Luke did and watch him use you
[time=2538] when Paul went on missionary journey number one he didn't have Luke and he was sick almost the
[time=2545] entire time from that day forward after he finally got back from that time Luke was with him
[time=2551] Luke was willing to take the power and the influence and the well-being and who knows what it would
[time=2558] have been in that day but probably likely a physician in that day was well educated and highly esteemed and Luke said Lord I give you my profession and the Lord said Lord Luke you just follow
[time=2569] Paul around through all the dangers through all the toils through all the travail and you take care of my mouthpiece and so he did you remember I just wrote you read to you second Timothy at the
[time=2583] end of Paul's life what do you say only who is with me Luke only Luke is with me and there must have been an enjoyment of friendship between those two men that both huge
[time=2595] intellects a medical doctor and this mind of the apostle Paul here's an educated individual that
[time=2601] they can converse and enjoy that kind of fellowship that goes on between two guys like that did God use Luke you bet he did not only did he keep the apostle Paul up and running for his
[time=2612] entire life and the course of his entire ministry but Luke went on to write 52 chapters of the new
[time=2618] testament the whole book of Acts and then the gospel of Luke just think where you and I would be without the book of Acts my lands and you don't have to go full time to do that
[time=2631] God to give your vocation to God doesn't mean you have to follow some preacher around doesn't mean you have to stop doing your trade it just means when you're in your trade
[time=2641] when you get up and you go to work in the morning you say God I give you my vocation this whole thing is about you this is your sphere of influence for me to minister the gospel of Jesus Christ
[time=2652] that's all that means don't go to work for money don't go to work to maintain your mortgage don't go to work even for just a promotion go to work because you've given your vocation to God and you're excited to see how he uses you in that situation because Luke shows us as does Joseph who
[time=2671] gave his vocation to God in the Old Testament as does Daniel neither of those guys were preachers of sorts they were secular guys I mean they ran governments but they gave their lives in their
[time=2682] heart and their vocation to God and God used them in phenomenal ways well we need to skip over
[time=2689] Demas there at the end of verse 14 we'll come back to him in a minute he's number eight so let's skip Demas and let's go down to number nine a man by the name
[time=2701] of archipas archipas verse 17 and say to archipas take heed to the ministry which you have received
[time=2710] in the Lord that you may fulfill it let me tell you about archipas archipas was likely
[time=2720] the interim pastor when a paphras left a paphras goes to Rome to get help on big major heavy duty
[time=2728] doctrinal issues and who's going to attend the sheep while he's gone well it's probably archipas and he is here in this ministry and you already know the condition of the Colossian church it's being attacked by false prophets it's being divided and torn and shredded at the core of its being by attacking the person of Christ and he's sitting there trying to hold this thing together and he's obviously contemplating getting out of the ministry because it says there in verse 17 take heed in other words pay attention to this thing get after it the one that you've received the
[time=2756] ministry that you have received and fulfill it which means see it all the way through no backing out
[time=2762] God uses people who refuse to give up no matter how hard the situation gets that's the principle
[time=2780] listen just get used to it living for God oftentimes is full of hardship and difficulty and setbacks
[time=2786] and disappointments we see that in every one every one of Paul's missionary journeys in fact
[time=2792] every ministry we can read about except the church at Thessalonica was in trouble
[time=2798] you read the book of revelation you read the Lord's assessment of those churches and there's trouble and it's not uncommon and this you should take encouragement from it is not uncommon for
[time=2809] people who have risen in the ranks of Christendom or I should say descended into greatness by being servants who are pastors like this man here archapace even like Timothy himself
[time=2821] personally mentored by the apostle Paul it is not uncommon for people of that level of commitment to Christ to find discouragement in their life to the degree they want to quit Timothy you don't have to look there I'll read it to you second Timothy 4 verse 1 says this Paul's
[time=2836] talking I solemnly charge you Timothy in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is judge of the living and the dead and by his appearing in his kingdom preach the word be ready in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with great patience and instruction
[time=2852] because Timothy wanted to quit and so Paul had to write this letter to him and then he says in verse 5 but you Timothy be sober in all things endure hardship do the work of an evangelist and fulfill
[time=2864] your ministry no quitting no turning bad you see even these guys feel that way
[time=2871] it's understandable that you would feel that way isn't it you look at your marriage and you go oh
[time=2877] you look at that debt load that you wrongly accumulated and you go to work another day under that particular individual staying faithful at your ministry
[time=2888] even here at this church I mean there's no wanting to quit is no new thing to christen them
[time=2894] that's what's so remarkable about the Lord he walked into the thing and faithfully pursued
[time=2900] the cross from the get-go even when he was sweating blop drops of blood right out of his forehead the night before he had to do the last part that's nothing new that's common if you're feeling that
[time=2912] if you're experiencing that in some dimension in your life that's not new if you're just flat out tired of being obedient and being obedient is hard and it doesn't bring a circumstantial fruit
[time=2923] immediately and you're thinking there's got to be a better way don't quit don't give up you want
[time=2929] to know why because god has a habit of using people who refuse to quit if that's all you've got you've
[time=2936] got that right and god does that god multiplies that all right let's go back up and meet mr number
[time=2945] nine demons verse 14 look the beloved physician sends you his greetings and also demons that's it
[time=2954] just also demons demons at this point in his life is serving the lord he is in this number
[time=2961] he is in this group at room he is helping out we see him mention at the end of the book of philemon
[time=2968] as my fellow worker so he is considered among their number he is considered a good man he is
[time=2974] considered helpful in the cause but it does not remain that way it does not remain that way
[time=2981] listen to these terrifying words that the apostle paul says about him in second timothy four nine
[time=2989] again this is the end of paul's life is years later he says make speaking to timothy make every
[time=2995] effort to come to me soon for demons having loved this present world has deserted me and gone to
[time=3004] thessalonica of all the people of all the kinds of people that god is showing us he can use in this
[time=3014] closing little paragraph of colossians four there's one kind of person god doesn't use and it's demis people who love this present world god is not in the business of using those kinds
[time=3028] of people and you may not be spectacular and you may not be talented and you may not be the most
[time=3034] gifted person around god will use you but if you love the things of this world and if you attach
[time=3041] yourself to the things of this world my friend you can count on the fact that god will not use you
[time=3048] you will be left out first john you remember what he said there to us do not love the world
[time=3056] nor the things in the world don't do that don't let yourself love the world or the
[time=3062] things of the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the boastful pride of life they are not from the father they are from the world and we know who runs the world system
[time=3073] god can use you for a zillion different reasons and through a zillion different hardships even through your own failure even through a pecker checkered past even through failure once you're in ministry but if you set your heart on the things of the world god won't use you
[time=3088] so these are the kinds of people that god uses tikka kas with a heart to serve
[time=3098] onesimus with the sinful past eris starkis the loyal friend mark the one with the blemish on his
[time=3105] record but he fought back was restored and made a contribution jesus justice the one who was
[time=3111] willing to sacrifice the comfort zone of family and friends and cultured to follow the person of jesus christ the paphras a great man of prayer who was concerned about other people's spiritual
[time=3123] growth and maturity in fact gave his life for that look a man who invited christ to take total charge of his vocation an archiepus a man who refused to quit and fight to fulfill god's
[time=3136] calling on his life and in sharp contrast to these there is demons i hope you're hearing god's voice
[time=3146] this morning i mean i really hope you're hearing god talk to you this morning
[time=3152] i hope you hear him saying to you know what i got a place for you in my kingdom here not just salvation i got a place of usefulness for you and it doesn't matter who you are what you look
[time=3162] like what you've been through what you have and what you don't have i got a place for you because i i have a way of using all different kinds of people to make unique contributions to the kingdom of god
[time=3173] at the same time i hope you hearing god's voice calling it for a little bit of a check up on on
[time=3180] the condition of your heart and saying i may have used you in the past like i use demons but you
[time=3186] shift your heart under the things of the world and my friend you'll desert think of it this way you know how when you go on a missionary trip you always see this don't you
[time=3198] the picture of everybody when they're over there you know going into all the world and take pictures and so they always take this picture at the end and everybody who was in the mission's trip is in the picture well let's just pretend it's today and the mission's trip is the fort went
[time=3215] in diana and we're the missionary team and it's going to be a big picture because there's a lot of us
[time=3222] where are you and we'll put little numbers you know we'll get right those little like one over your head and two over somebody else's head we'll get a little and then we'll have that one two three and that'll be designated underneath and this will be your name and what you did here's your name and what you did here's your name and who you were here's your name and how you helped here's your name and what you did how God used you what goes next to your number are you satisfied with that is that really how you want to be remembered are you doing enough if you are praise God if you're not reconsider because God may have better things in store for you than what you're currently doing and you know how you get one of those pictures if you take an eraser you can erase somebody's
[time=3264] face right off pretty soon they're oh it's beautiful picture but there's this white dot and we don't know who that is anymore don't be Demas don't be Demas don't be Demas don't let Satan get his eraser out and get you infected with the love for the world he goes yeah
[time=3282] see gone white space white space white space
[time=3289] let's pray to God
[time=3295] well isn't that an exciting truth from God's word that God uses all kinds of different people
[time=3306] and he is just amazing in his ability to do that he looks past some of the problems
[time=3312] and looks past some of the circumstances in our lives and if he can find in us a heart
[time=3318] that is willing and available then he uses us there's one kind of person as we mentioned that that God doesn't use and that's people who have an affection for the world a love for the things of the world more than they love God and that may be you you may really see in yourself a belief
[time=3336] and a value a kind of understanding that you think that the that the real part of life
[time=3342] consists in how much money you make or how much stuff you own or where you get to travel or
[time=3348] what you get to do and all that takes money and so for you life is bound up in the things of the world but there is the possibility that you're seeing through that kind of belief system that's a
[time=3359] very thin veneer you never seem to have enough money and even the people who have tons of money aren't really truly happy and that no matter what you buy you always have to buy something new and you're tired of that whole routine and you you can see through it you recognize it for what it is and you really want to grab a hold of life itself and you're looking for something more well my friend that comes through the person of Jesus Christ he said that he is the way the truth
[time=3384] and the life he said that he could give us life and allow us to have life abundantly and he means
[time=3390] they're a quality of life and a kind of life and a duration of life that is filled with meaning and
[time=3396] filled with purpose well if you're kind of coming to the end of a love for the world if you're
[time=3402] seeing through all of that and you're ready to take a hold of the person of Jesus Christ and let him give you life and show you how to live that life in a way that's meaningful and full of purpose
[time=3412] it begins by committing your life to the person of Jesus Christ it begins by confessing your sin
[time=3419] and your need for him as your savior and at that moment you start a new life in Christ it can happen
[time=3425] through a prayer that we could pray even right now I'll bow my head in a minute and lead you in that prayer if you're ready to make that decision then you bow your head as well and you pray silently
[time=3435] in your heart to God what I am saying out loud and if you mean it God will answer your prayer and
[time=3442] you'll begin to have life in a new way in Christ well let's pray together heavenly father I know
[time=3449] that I am a sinner I know that my life is empty I'm searching after things in this world and I can't
[time=3455] ever really find satisfaction I'm tired of looking there I'm tired of spending all my money and all
[time=3461] my time trying to be happy in the things of the world I confess my sin to you and I admit and I
[time=3468] acknowledge that I can only have life in the person of Jesus Christ so I ask him to come into my heart
[time=3474] and to be my savior to forgive me for my sins and to teach me how to live I pray these things in Jesus name amen well that's the most important prayer any person can make to accept Christ as
[time=3486] their personal Lord and Savior and if you just made that decision we'd love to hear about it here at the Bible hour so write us and let us know in a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive our free offer you can also receive a copy of today's message just ask for the tape number shown here
