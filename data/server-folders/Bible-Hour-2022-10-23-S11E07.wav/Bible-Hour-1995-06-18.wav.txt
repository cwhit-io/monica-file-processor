[time=0] The lesser light, a very dim light in the triad of relationship observances.
[time=10] It's called Father's Day.
[time=13] It's that time that we do remember but not well.
[time=20] It's the time when, if you maybe saw the little cartoon in the paper this morning, the little cartoon Krabby, she defined Father's Day for us.
[time=28] It's that one day a year when people who have always been complaining about your wardrobe give you a really weird tie, or they give you a screwdriver, or some other guy's things.

[time=506] Opening my eyes I see the answer to my soul's great lead to belong to be more than what I am,
[time=519] stunning the reality and forming now inside of me, I'm a part of the beauty of the bride,
[time=532] my belongingness was bought by his faithfulness, was purchased with his blood. We will see him
[time=548] coming with his arms held open wide, captivated by the hidden beauty of the bride, sooner than we know,
[time=562] and all the ones he will appear, and we will finally be made one, and last we'll hear the
[time=571] bridegroom calling call, and call, on this now soon be home, lonely now but never alone with the
[time=590] first to keep myself for him, he has made his purpose clear, choosing not to leave me here, still I'm
[time=603] long and I wait to hear his call, my belongingness was bought by his faithfulness, was purchased with
[time=618] his blood. We will see him coming with his arms held open wide, captivated by the hidden beauty of
[time=633] the bride, sooner than we know, and all the ones he will appear, and we will finally be made one,
[time=645] and last we'll hear the bridegroom calling call, the spirit and the bride say come, and let the
[time=666] one who hears say come, and to walk who thirst, let them come, we will see him coming with his
[time=682] arms held open wide, captivated by the hidden beauty of the bride, sooner than we know, and all the
[time=695] ones he will appear, and we will finally be made one, and last we'll hear the bridegroom calling,
[time=705] we will finally be made one, when we hear the bridegroom calling call, calling call, calling call,
[time=725] I first heard the name Bob Neenheis shortly after I had moved from my family, I had moved from
[time=740] Grand Ledge near Lansing, Michigan, to come here seven years ago and begin ministry at Blackhawk.
[time=746] The church there was without any pastoral staff, and I'm not sure exactly how long it was, but
[time=753] not too long before we started getting reports back from people very positive about the ministry of God that continued in that church through Bob Neenheis, who was kind of filling in as an interim as the church continued their search for a pastor. I had never met Bob before, and he hadn't
[time=769] had a ministry at Grand Ledge, but the people there grew to love him and appreciate his ministry of
[time=776] the Word and his service to them during that difficult time for them in their search. Since that
[time=782] time, God has led he and his family here to Fort Wayne, so we have had the opportunity to get to know them as he is vice president at Taylor overseeing the work and the direction of the Fort
[time=793] Wayne campus here in town, and so we've appreciated the chance to get especially to know him and his
[time=800] wife Betty Jo and Sarah who just graduated from the Blackhawk Christian school last weekend, so would you welcome this morning Bob Neenheis as he comes to share God's truth with us, it's good to have you Bob. Thank you. It's always nice to be here to be able to share the Word of God. This, as
[time=823] you're probably aware, is the third in the triad of relationship observances that we celebrate in
[time=831] our country. It's also the lesser light of the three in all honesty. The bright light, the
[time=839] big event in relationship observances is Valentine's Day, February 14 for those of you who lose track
[time=846] of those kinds of things. Valentine's Day is that time of year when men go out and buy really expensive cards, bring home candy that none of us should be eating, buy flowers at inflated prices
[time=860] and say, "Here honey, I love you." It's a wonderful time and it's an important time and if you ever
[time=867] miss it, you're probably going to be crippled for life. But that's the bright light in the triad of
[time=874] relationship observances. The second light almost as bright is Mother's Day. Mother's Day is that
[time=884] time of year when we intend to buy a card and forget and then as a result everybody goes out for
[time=890] lunch to make up for not having gotten the card. If you've ever tried to go out for lunch on Mother's
[time=896] Day, you realize that unless you're there at six o'clock in the morning or at four o'clock in the afternoon, everything is filled. It's because there's the unwritten rule that says mothers are not
[time=908] allowed to cook on Mother's Day. Actually it's dad's way of saying, "Gee honey, I'm really sorry I
[time=914] forgot the card but maybe this will make up for it." And apparently it does and apparently men never
[time=921] learn because every year it's the same. Well now today is the third light, the lesser light, a very dim
[time=927] light in the triad of relationship observances. It's called Father's Day. It's that time that we do
[time=937] remember but not well. It's the time when if you maybe saw the little cartoon in the paper this
[time=945] morning, the little cartoon Krabby, she defined Father's Day for us. It's that one day a year when
[time=951] people who have always been complaining about your wardrobe give you a really weird tie or they give
[time=958] you a screwdriver or some other guy thing and that's Father's Day but it doesn't get the time that
[time=969] Mother's Day gets and it certainly doesn't come anywhere close to what Valentine's Day gets. Yet it
[time=976] is Father's Day and I determined a couple of weeks ago that I did want to speak to fathers on Father's
[time=983] Day and when I was talking with my family about it they said, "Well what about us?" I mean you talk to fathers but I'm a wife and mother and we have two daughters and they say we need equal time and I
[time=993] said, "Well I think really that what I'm going to want to say will have application to all of us but I really want to say it to fathers." I mean we do preach special messages on Valentine's Day about love
[time=1004] and we do preach special messages on Mother's Day about mothers and fathers deserve a little equal
[time=1011] time along the way he says as a father. So I began to read in scripture about what it says to us
[time=1018] about fatherly examples and I got pretty disappointed actually because you see if you start to look in
[time=1025] scripture to find out what kind of examples are there of fathers in the text it gets pretty depressing.
[time=1031] It's a not too flattering example of fatherhood. Let me illustrate with a couple of points. Take a
[time=1041] lot for instance in Genesis 19. Lot is in his home he has visitors come they're in Sodom and the men
[time=1048] in Sodom are coming to the doorway saying send out your visitors to us and Lot goes outside and
[time=1055] says no wait please don't do this this is a great wrong. Here are my two virgin daughters who have
[time=1061] never known a man take them instead. That's a father. I can't imagine that. I have two daughters.
[time=1068] I can't imagine saying to a crowd here have your way with my daughters but Lot did.
[time=1074] Not a very good example of fathering. Neither is Isaac in Genesis 25 who clearly chooses
[time=1083] favorites among his two sons. His wife gives birth to Jacob and Esau and over time as these men grow
[time=1090] and develop he says no you know Esau that's my boy. Jacob too but Esau that's the one I like.
[time=1097] Now if you have more than one child you know the disaster that results when you say I like
[time=1103] that one better than that one. I like that one better than all the rest of them put together.
[time=1108] Yet Isaac did that and it created huge problems for him. There was Aiken in Joshua 7
[time=1114] who goes off to do battle with the children of Israel and they're told don't take any of the
[time=1120] plunder leave it but he sees some stuff and says well that's really good stuff. I'd like to have that. That'd look really nice in our tent back home so he takes it and brings it back home and calls the family together and says hey I took this stuff. We're going to hide it under the tent
[time=1135] but we'll keep it for us. While the people of Israel go through immense turmoil they're defeated in a battle they should have easily won and through the process of God's leading it comes down to point to Aiken who has stolen that which he was not to take and Aiken and his family who conspired to gather under father's leadership
[time=1156] are led to the edge of the camp where they are stoned to death because Aiken brought his family
[time=1163] into sin. I think of Saul in 1 Samuel 19. Saul is really jealous of David. David's getting a lot
[time=1171] of attention a lot of acclaim and Saul calls over his son Jonathan. He says Jonathan I want you to
[time=1180] go and kill your friend David. I can't imagine a father saying to his son go and kill your friend
[time=1189] but Saul did. There was David. David who had many sons but I think of the strife between two of them
[time=1198] Absalom and Amnon. Absalom had a sister named Tamar and Amnon really liked Tamar and eventually
[time=1206] raped her and David did nothing upon learning of Amnon's sin. And Absalom and Amnon were at
[time=1216] enmity between one another over the sin that was done and David did nothing to bring
[time=1222] reconciliation between his two sons. And I think that's not a very good example of fathering either.
[time=1229] As Betty Jo and I were talking some earlier about what I've been reading and what I've been
[time=1236] discovering she said why do you think it is that the examples in the Old Testament of fathering
[time=1243] are so deplorable and so bad. I said frankly I don't know. I wish I had an answer for that.
[time=1250] Maybe it's to help us as fathers realize how difficult our task is. That it's not all that
[time=1257] easy to be a father. It's relatively simple to become a father but it's not all that easy to be a
[time=1264] father. And maybe it's to help us realize our great need for God's help in this whole process
[time=1272] of being a father. That we cannot do it by ourselves under our own power but we need God's help and
[time=1280] God's wisdom and God's strength. Well this morning I want to encourage fathers with three truths
[time=1288] about being a father. I think we need some help along the way some reminders and some
[time=1295] encouragement and these three truths I believe can help us a great deal. Now in reality they
[time=1301] apply to all parents and grandparents and probably have application and some uncles and so it'll fit all of us but my focus will be specifically upon parents and particularly upon the father today.
[time=1312] Three truths about fathering drawn from the relationship of Abraham and Isaac, his son.
[time=1321] We're going to begin in Genesis 12 and I invite you to have your Bibles open to Genesis chapter 12 this morning. We're going to be looking at a number of passages in the book of Genesis and Genesis 12 is where we will begin. There will be three truths and the first truth is this.
[time=1339] We receive our children as a gift of God's grace.
[time=1344] We receive our children as a gift of God's grace. The story of the birth of Isaac really begins in
[time=1355] Genesis 12 although his actual birth doesn't take place for several chapters. It really has its roots back in Genesis 12. Follow along as I read. Now the Lord said to Abraham go forth from your
[time=1367] country and from your relatives and from your father's house to the land which I will show you and I will make you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great and so you shall be a blessing and I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you
[time=1382] I will curse and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
[time=1388] Now understand that Abraham at this point in his life is 75 years old and God has come to him
[time=1395] about the time when he's starting to think about rocking chairs and retirement centers and said Abraham I've got good news for you. We're going to move to a new place just kind of pack up your tent
[time=1407] and gather to gather all of your goods and we're going to head out and when we get there I'll tell you from time to time we'll go out for dinner and every once in a while it's kind of like
[time=1419] well I don't know where we're going to want to go and I remember one time Betty Jo and I were going out to weed and it was one of those I'll know it when I see it adventures those can be
[time=1429] really disastrous because I see virtually every place that has food I figure that's a good place to eat I'll eat anything that isn't moving by itself anymore but Betty Jo had something in mind
[time=1441] and she wasn't able to define it she was just one of those I'll know it when I see it.
[time=1444] I can't imagine what it must have been like for 75 year old Abraham to pack up his tent pick up his belongings and head off and God saying when you get there I'll tell you but he did.
[time=1456] Oh and by the way Abram you and Sarai have not yet had children but good news you're going to be a
[time=1465] parent anybody here 75 anybody want to admit being 75 can you imagine at 75 having someone come along
[time=1480] and say good news you're going to be a parent grandparents tell me that the best thing about
[time=1488] having grandchildren come is that they leave and if you're 75 and you're going to give birth they
[time=1494] don't go they just stay and stay and stay well that was what God said to Abram the promise
[time=1503] of descendants is repeated again in the seventh verse the Lord appeared to Abram and said to your descendants I will give this land so he built an altar there to the Lord who had appeared to him and again in chapter 13 verse 16 and I will make your descendants as the dust of the earth so that
[time=1518] if anyone can number the dust of the earth then your descendants can also be numbered.
[time=1523] Abram life is going to be very different for you. While time passes several years go by
[time=1530] still no child still no offspring no beginning of all of this descendancy that's to take place
[time=1537] and Abram finally raises the question with God one day in chapter 15 God comes and repeats the
[time=1546] promise. Verse one of chapter 15 after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision
[time=1553] saying do not fear Abram I am a shield to you your reward should be very great and Abram said oh Lord God what will God give me since I am childless and the heir of my house is illiezer of Damascus
[time=1566] it's kind of like Abram is saying to God God in case you hadn't noticed you talk about descendants
[time=1572] and all of that we don't have any children just thought it maybe call that to your mind
[time=1578] all right the closest thing I have to a descendant is illiezer my man servant and if I die now everything goes to him that's not quite what God had in mind that's not what descendant means so we read on
[time=1595] verse four then behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this man will not be your heir but
[time=1602] one who shall come forth from your own body he shall be your heir and God took Abram outside and
[time=1608] said now look toward the heavens and count the stars if you're able to count them and God said to Abram so shall your descendants be and then notice the sixth verse then Abram believed in the
[time=1619] Lord and he reckoned it to him as righteousness he was childless at 75 when God said Abram a new
[time=1630] land and descendants my gift to you he's now probably in his middle ladies or so still no descendants the land is being realized but still no descendants but God says Abram trust me and Abram says God I trust you he believes what God says
[time=1651] and it's counted to him as righteousness well more time passes for now over to Genesis 17
[time=1659] Abram now is 99 years old he's been 24 years since the promise has come to him
[time=1665] 24 years of expectant waiting saying when is this child going to be born to us and it still isn't
[time=1673] happening now if you thought it was scary to be apparent for the first time at 75 imagine being 99 and still waiting for this blessed event to take place blessed event which has a certain
[time=1686] downside to it at that point in your life and again the promise is repeated verse verse two
[time=1693] I will establish my covenant between me and you and I will multiply you exceedingly verse four
[time=1699] as for me behold my covenant is with you and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations verse six I will make you exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of you and king shall come
[time=1710] forth from you it's repeated over and over again Abram what I said I am going to do in fact
[time=1716] Abram I am going to change your name as emphasis for what I have said Abram somewhat ironically means exalted father Abram with his wife Sarai had no children and every time someone called him by name it was a
[time=1732] kind of a just a goat in the ribs here is a reminder of the fact that the exalted father has no
[time=1742] children while Abram your name is going to be different now it's going to be Abraham
[time=1748] it goes from being exalted father to father of multitudes God I'm 99 years old this doesn't just happen to 99 year old men my wife is 89
[time=1761] it's getting a little tough for us here God oh by the way Sarai her name has changed too and
[time=1769] she's going to become the mother of multitudes and now it's Abraham and Sarah and what is the
[time=1777] response of this couple well it's probably like what you and I would experience if we were in
[time=1783] their situation Genesis 17 verse 17 then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart
[time=1791] will a child be born to a man 100 years old and will Sarah who is 90 years old bear a child
[time=1799] Sarah's response was pretty similar to that over in chapter 18 verse 12 and Sarah laughed to herself
[time=1805] saying after I have become old shall I have pleasure my lord being old also
[time=1811] I don't really blame Abraham and Sarah for that kind of response 99 and 89 and they're going to
[time=1821] have a child it seems a little unreasonable given the fact that she has been barren all
[time=1827] through the normal child bearing years and now something is going to happen in her old age which allows her to conceive and give birth to a child time passes somewhere in the range of
[time=1843] nine months or so apparently because in Genesis chapter 21 we read these words then the lord took
[time=1853] note of Sarah as he had said and the lord did for Sarah as he had promised so Sarah conceived
[time=1859] and bore a son to Abraham in his old age at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him
[time=1866] and Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him whom Sarah bore to him Isaac
[time=1874] Isaac is born the child that they had anticipated and looked forward to finally comes
[time=1882] and dad's 100 years old and mom is 90 imagine the middle of the night feedings you get up I can't you get up I can't either
[time=1893] it's not easy being apparent there's reasons why God gives them to us when we're younger
[time=1901] but 90 and 100 it must have been a staggering thing even more so given the fact that they had
[time=1910] waited and planned and prayed and anticipated for so very long for something which they thought
[time=1916] would never happen we tend to think of conception as a biological process which follows a physical
[time=1925] act and it is but it's much more than that in reality I believe children are a gift of God's
[time=1934] grace here is Sarah who is barren who endures the shame and disappointment of barrenness
[time=1942] unable to conceive until that point when God acts it's a point far beyond the time that we
[time=1951] normally we consider child raising child-bearing years
[time=1958] she is unable to conceive until God intervenes I don't know why some couples are unable to conceive
[time=1967] I don't understand God's purpose in that kind of circumstance although I know what happens
[time=1974] and this much I do know and I would say to those of you who know the pain of an inability to conceive
[time=1982] that inability is not a result of God's loving you less than he loves others beyond that I find more questions than answers but it also reminds me that the ability to conceive
[time=1997] children is not strictly biological it is a gift of God's grace and because children are indeed a
[time=2006] gift of God's grace they must be treated with love and respect and care both in the womb
[time=2014] and after birth and throughout their normal life Dad I urge you to accept your children as a gift of God's grace
[time=2024] they are more than just your progeny you're offspring a trophy to be held up saying look what I have done
[time=2034] they are a gift of God's grace as was the case with Abraham and Sarah God closed her womb and she was unable to conceive God opens her womb and she conceives and gives
[time=2045] birth to his son and our ability to be fathers is not dependent upon our physical prowess
[time=2052] but upon God's grace and the children he gives to us are a gift of his grace
[time=2059] and are to be loved and nurtured and cared for when someone gives us a gift
[time=2066] a particularly valuable treasured gift we place it where it can be seen and valued
[time=2075] children are a gift and are to be valued because they come from our heavenly Father
[time=2084] so our first truth we must receive our children as gifts of God's grace the second truth builds on that we are to teach and model biblical truth for our children
[time=2097] we are to teach and model biblical truth for our children
[time=2103] we know virtually nothing of the early training of Isaac here's a young boy who was born to
[time=2111] parents who are slightly up in years can you imagine as he starts totalling around the tent
[time=2117] Abraham and Sarah who are now 102 and 92 going after the two-year-old toddler
[time=2123] oh I pick him up but I think I threw something out and now he's 10 or 11 or 12 he's into that pre-adolescent adolescent trauma area feeling old acting young
[time=2141] unfortunately Abraham's now 110 111 112 little tough to get excited about going to softball
[time=2148] games at that point in life Sarah is 100 101 102 oh life must have been a challenge for them
[time=2157] and in the midst of all of this here's this son the one that they had longed for and prayed for
[time=2163] and anticipated for so long God comes to Abraham for the most unusual request chapter 22
[time=2171] came about after these things that God tested Abraham and said to him Abraham
[time=2177] and Abraham said here I am kind of like this happens all the time God and I have in conversation
[time=2184] didn't seem to throw him off but I'll bet that his blood almost stopped in his veins
[time=2190] when he heard what God said take now your son your only son the son you love
[time=2198] Isaac and go to the land of Mariah and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains
[time=2205] of which I will tell you God wait a minute did I understand you correctly
[time=2213] this son the one that you have promised us the one that we have waited for the one that you miraculously provided well beyond our time and life of childbearing you want me now to take this son
[time=2224] and offer him as a sacrifice what about the promise of of more than the sands of the sea what about the
[time=2232] the stars in the sky this is my grain of sand my my star it's the only one I have
[time=2239] and you want me to offer him as a sacrifice I don't understand
[time=2248] that I misunderstand what you said other dramatic thing is that there is no statement like that in scripture
[time=2256] instead Abraham here's what God says in verse three begins so Abraham rose early in the morning
[time=2263] and saddled his donkey and took two of his young men his servants with him and Isaac his son and he split wood for the burnt offering and arose and went to the place of which God had told him
[time=2275] Abraham says I've come this far by faith I will believe he doesn't argue doesn't protest at least
[time=2286] is not recorded here instead he goes now they come to the final stages of the journey and there's a
[time=2296] conversation that takes place actually there are two conversations one is between Abraham and the servants notice what goes on here verse four on the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from a distance and Abraham said to his young men stay here with the donkey and I in the lad will go yonder and we will worship and return to you there's a statement full of faith and hope
[time=2317] that Abraham makes verse six and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and later on Isaac his son and he took
[time=2327] in his hand the fire and the knife and the two of them walked on together and Isaac spoke to
[time=2333] Abraham his father and said my father and he said here I am my son and he said behold the fire
[time=2342] and the wood but where is the lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said God will provide for
[time=2350] himself the lamb for the burnt offering my son so the two of them walked on together
[time=2356] Abraham's response to Isaac is so deep and so penetrating and so full of faith
[time=2366] and we come to verse nine and I think verse nine is even more profound for what is not there than
[time=2374] what is there they came to the place of which God had told him and Abraham built the altar
[time=2381] there and arranged the wood and bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood
[time=2388] there's no record in scripture of Isaac protesting as his father took the cords and wrapped them
[time=2396] around his arms and bound him together there's no cry as he lifts him up and places him on the
[time=2402] altar and stands over him with a knife in his hand somewhere along the line Isaac has learned what
[time=2411] Abraham has learned that God is faithful and can be trusted and as Isaac succumbs to his father
[time=2420] Abraham in trust so Abraham and Isaac together give themselves in faith to whatever it is God
[time=2429] is doing at this point in time we can be sure that that kind of faith and trust did not just happen
[time=2437] it wasn't that all of a sudden Isaac finds himself in this situation and he just succumbs to it all
[time=2444] there's something dramatic that has been taking place in his life and I believe it's the instruction
[time=2450] of his father through those growing up years that allows him to give at this particular point in
[time=2456] time for instance I can imagine Abraham during those early years of Isaac's life sitting down
[time=2462] with Isaac and saying Isaac you wouldn't believe what it was like I was 75 settled prosperous and
[time=2470] God came to me and said Abraham come with us come to a new place and I'm going to give you a great
[time=2478] land and make you the father of a multitude Isaac I didn't know what God was doing but I followed
[time=2485] him and he showed himself to be faithful and then as Isaac would celebrate his birthdays I can
[time=2491] imagine father Abraham sitting down with him and saying Isaac I must remind you again of the
[time=2498] miraculousness of your birth we were well past childbearing years and God provided us the
[time=2507] opportunity to have a son and Isaac you are that son you are a gift of God's grace to your mother
[time=2514] and to me and we love you so I have to believe Abraham was teaching Isaac all of the things
[time=2523] that he had learned about God all of what it meant to walk by faith into unknown circumstances
[time=2529] all that he had learned that God was indeed faithful and could be trusted and the lessons were not lost on Isaac because you see as we read on in the book of Genesis we
[time=2542] find that much of what Isaac does is directly based upon what his father had done there was a lot
[time=2550] of learning that took place in Genesis 25 for instance Isaac finds himself married to Rebecca
[time=2556] but Rebecca is barren she is unable to have children and his mind must have gone back to what had
[time=2562] taken place between his father and his mother and how God had provided in their need and Isaac
[time=2569] prays and he asked God to open Rebecca's womb and she conceives and gives birth to children
[time=2576] in Genesis 26 God renews the promise he had made to Abraham only now he renews it to Isaac
[time=2583] and as we had seen already in Genesis 12 verse 7 when God renewed his promise to Abraham
[time=2589] he then built an altar and worshiped God so Isaac as he becomes the recipient of this promise
[time=2595] builds an altar and worships God and said this promise is one which is a gift from God
[time=2602] and draws forth worship to God again in chapter 26 of Genesis we find Isaac being very gracious
[time=2611] in his dealings with the Philistans there was a lot of squabbling going on between the herdsmen of Isaac and the herdsmen of the Philistans over some wells and Isaac says hey it's not a big deal we will simply move over here and sink new wells and provide for our herds and our flocks from those new wells and you see that's exactly what Abraham had done back in Genesis chapter 13
[time=2634] when Abraham and Lot were parceling out the land and the senior uncle Abraham said to his
[time=2642] younger nephew Lot you choose first pick the land you like and Lot looked over the land and said I
[time=2649] like this really fertile valley here of the Jordan River I want to be here and Abraham said that's
[time=2656] fine not a problem we'll go over here and we'll build our tents in our community over here there's
[time=2664] a graciousness in dealing with people and Isaac learned all of that as he listened to his father Abraham tell him the stories and walk with him through the growth that he had experienced in his
[time=2676] relationship with God we must be honest here and acknowledge that not everything that Isaac
[time=2682] learned was good you see there was a point in time actually there were two points in time where Abraham committed the same sin as he found himself confronted by outsiders he would say to Sarai
[time=2696] his wife why don't you just try to pass yourself off as my sister instead of as my wife because if
[time=2702] they find out you're my wife they may decide that they want you and they'll kill me and there's a point in time where Isaac says to Rebecca his wife when confronted in a very
[time=2713] similar situation why don't you pass yourself off as my sister instead of my wife because I fear
[time=2721] for my life what does all of this say to us well we certainly have a responsibility as
[time=2730] fathers to teach and model biblical principles and recognize that what we teach and how we model
[time=2738] will indeed then be found in the lives of our children in the years to come we may not see it
[time=2744] all when we want to but it does begin to make its way back into their lives and into their actions
[time=2750] and into their their behavior one of the first things I learned in communication theory is that we
[time=2758] teach both by what we say and by the way we live or act the nonverbal communication but if there's
[time=2767] ever any kind of conflict between those two the one that always takes priority is the nonverbal
[time=2773] I will believe what you do if there's conflict between what you do and what you say
[time=2779] Abraham may have said to Isaac it's important that you live a life of integrity but because he had
[time=2787] some failures in his own life Isaac also seemed to pick up some of those failures yet at the same time Abraham modeled and taught biblical integrity and biblical truth
[time=2798] and Isaac's life did reflect that as well father's teacher children and model for your
[time=2806] children the kind of biblical lifestyle that you want them to have for themselves
[time=2813] teach by word and teach by example I've found that with our girls as we were growing up that it
[time=2821] doesn't always work to sit down at the kitchen table and say let's talk heavy we need a serious
[time=2827] conversation and then you begin to pontificate to them that doesn't work all that effectively
[time=2833] what does work is as you're driving down the road going someplace together you take that teachable moment to apply a biblical truth and you bring it through in conversation not in some
[time=2844] kind of formalized structure what does work is standing side by side at the kitchen sink doing dishes and talking about life and handling the various circumstances that come into life what does work is allowing them to watch you for good or ill sometimes to see how you handle the
[time=2864] circumstances of life and what it means to be a Christian when things are going well and when
[time=2870] things aren't going so well children are gift of God's grace and as parents and especially today
[time=2878] as fathers we have a responsibility to teach and model biblical truth for our children
[time=2887] and then we come to the third truth and this is perhaps the most difficult of the three
[time=2893] having received our children as a gift of God's grace having taught and modeled for them biblical
[time=2899] truth and biblical living we then release our children back to God we give them back to God
[time=2909] I can only imagine Abraham's pain as he hears God's message
[time=2915] and begins to understand a little bit of what God is asking him to do
[time=2921] this is the son for whom he had longed and prayed this was the fulfillment of his dreams his
[time=2928] aspirations and of God's promise to him and if God was going to give him descendants as numerous
[time=2934] as the sands of the sea or the stars in the sky why would he take this one son from him the only hope that Abraham had that he could see of the promise being fulfilled
[time=2946] still in obedience they set out and it must have been a heavy heart that filled Abraham
[time=2955] as they walked I wonder what Abraham said to Sarah as they left that morning
[time=2963] I wonder what he said to her as they walked away from the tent knowing what was about to happen did he tell her if so what was Sarah's response I wonder if his feet began to drag just a little
[time=2977] bit as they got closer and could see the mountain come into view and he knew that this was the destination and he knew it had to happen there I wonder if he walked a little slower dragged his feet just a little more I wonder if that feeling in the pit of his stomach didn't begin to churn ever more as they drew closer to this ominous sight the words that Abraham speaks to his servants as he and Isaac walk on you wait here we're going
[time=3004] to go worship and we'll be back I wonder if it sounded as confident as the words appear on page I wonder if there was a tone in his voice that said I don't really know if we're going to make this
[time=3016] or not I wonder what he said to Isaac because he bound him and placed him on the altar and as he
[time=3027] stood over him with a knife tears creasing that leathery old face preparing now to sacrifice his
[time=3038] son to God what was Abraham doing and all of that he was giving his son back to God he's saying
[time=3049] this is not my child it is a gift from your grace I have taught and nurtured and modeled before
[time=3057] this child what it means to be a follower of the true God and now I give him back and the scary
[time=3065] thing is that God asks us to do the same with our children they are not a permanent possession but we surrender them back to the Father Betty Jo and I are at that awkward stage in life
[time=3078] we've been married for 24 years and for 21 of those 24 years we've had at least one child in the house
[time=3086] but two weeks ago Sarah crossed this stage and received her high school diploma and now we'll follow her sister to college and Becky will be a senior and Sarah will be a freshman and
[time=3098] this past weekend we were at Taylor for orientation and registration and we filled out all the forms
[time=3104] and the classes have been signed up and Sarah's met her roommate and come August 25
[time=3110] she's gone and a couple days later her sister follows after her and then it's Mon-Pon the dog
[time=3119] there hasn't been Mon-Pon the dog for a long time and that's a different stage in life some of you have been there and some of you think that'll never come but it will and some of us are neck deep in it and it's a strange feeling and I go through some melancholy
[time=3137] from time to time thinking about it and yet I realized that these children are not mine to control
[time=3146] but they're a gift of God's grace and we have sought to build into the lives of our children and at some point and now is that point we begin to release them to whatever God has for them
[time=3157] that's my job as a dad not to keep my children doing what I think they ought to do but to release
[time=3166] them so that they can be what God wants them to be and do what God wants them to do and go where God wants them to go and that may not always be what we have in mind in all honesty
[time=3179] I have a colleague whose children are literally around the world they surrendered them to God and
[time=3186] gave them over to Christian service even within God took one child and moved her to Japan
[time=3192] and God took another child and moved him to Russia and there's the joy that these children
[time=3200] and their families are involved in full-time vocational ministry but when your children and your grandchildren are half a world away there's a lot of pain that comes to the parents who sit here in Fort Wayne
[time=3213] or I think of friends whose daughter and son-in-law were joined in marriage and he felt called to
[time=3220] the ministry and was preparing for ministry but the fit wasn't there
[time=3227] and things began to change and they moved home to live with their parents and they lived there for four years and they had a couple of children while they were there
[time=3240] and mom and dad had kids and the grandkids all the time they just recently moved out of the house
[time=3252] he was retrained got some education prepared for a new career but that's what it meant to be a
[time=3258] parent you let them go and sometimes they come back and then you have to let them go again only this time it's harder because things are so different but no one said letting go would be easy
[time=3269] as parents we always have dreams for our children we have hopes and desires and aspirations
[time=3275] and we want only the best for them and if only they'll do what we tell them it'll be okay
[time=3283] if only they'll go where we want them to go and do what we want them to do but i'm so thankful for a father today who said bob i would love for you to come with me in the
[time=3292] business kennene heiss and son auto sales but if that's not what you want to do i don't want you
[time=3300] there i said thanks because i really didn't want to do that i really didn't want to do that
[time=3310] and you let them go and sometimes they stay in town and sometimes they don't
[time=3317] sometimes they stay close by and can get home on father's day and sometimes they can't
[time=3325] but what's important is that you realize that these children are not mine to hold
[time=3331] they are a gift of god's grace i nurture them and i equip them and i model for them what it means
[time=3338] to walk by faith in the living god and that i release them back to god for his purposes and that's what it means to be a father fathering is not easy if you've been reading the paper the last couple of days
[time=3353] you've read as i have the editorials decrying the state of fatherhood in america 30 percent of all homes with children have no father present we have absentee fathers we have
[time=3366] dead beat dads we have a whole list of things and i go back to scripture and i say no fathering has never been easy
[time=3374] while it's relatively simple to become a father it's very difficult to go on being a father
[time=3382] and for that we need the help of god and the wisdom of scripture and dads
[time=3390] isn't it great to be a father isn't an awful an awful lot of work also to be a father
[time=3397] remember these truths our children are a gift of god's grace he gives them to us so that we can
[time=3406] nurture them and train them in biblical truth and principles and then he says now release them
[time=3414] to my love and care so they can be all that i want them to be and go where i need them to be
[time=3421] and do what i need them to do and you as a father will have been the greatest success you can be
[time=3432] when you embrace those truths and apply them in your own homes let us pray please
