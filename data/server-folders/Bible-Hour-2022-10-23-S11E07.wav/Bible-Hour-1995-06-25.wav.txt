[time=0] Well, I want to talk today about a power shock, but a different kind of power shock.
[time=7] We'll give it a capital P and a capital S. And the power shocks that we talk about today,
[time=13] let me give you a definition of those. A power shock is a high impact encounter with the power of God. A high impact encounter with the power of God. And my reason for talking about this
[time=25] morning, my purpose is simply to let us be reminded and impacted again by the power of
[time=31] God, because I think too often we kind of go through life and we are forgetful. And we don't
[time=37] let the significant power of God impact our lives.
[time=41] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church. Thank you for
[time=52] joining us. Speaking today in Pastor Moore's absence is our associate pastor, Tim Teder.
[time=57] His message is entitled, "Power Shock." But right now, let's join the sanctuary choir
[time=63] as they sing wonderful, merciful Savior.
[time=82] Wonderful merciful Savior. Freshest, sweet, dear, and friend. O, what I thought I had for you. Rest in the souls of men. All you rest in the soul.
[time=111] The souls of men.
[time=119] Councillor, composer, keeper. Spirit, we long to embrace. You offer hope when our hearts tear.
[time=139] Lo, bless, we lost away. Oh, we hope, bless, we lost away.
[time=151] You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore.
[time=164] You give the healing and praise some. Hearts always come through. Oh, our hearts always come through.
[time=192] Almighty, infinite power. They fully love in your own.
[time=205] Here in our weakness you find us. Calling before your throne. Oh, we're calling before your throne.
[time=224] You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore. You give the healing and praise some.
[time=243] Hearts always come through. Oh, our hearts always come through.
[time=257] You are the one that we praise. You are the one we adore.
[time=269] You give the healing and praise some. Hearts always come through. Oh, our hearts always come through.
[time=289] We'll return to our service in just a moment, but right now I'd like to tell you about our special gift from the Bible Hour, a lovely digital desk clock with an inspiring picture of two climbers forging up a mountainside,
[time=318] and the inscription, together we achieve the extraordinary. This handsome teamwork digital desk clock is our free gift to you when you write to the Bible Hour.
[time=329] Stay tuned. I'll be giving you our address at the end of the program.
[time=339] Only Jesus, only He brings redemption through and free.
[time=364] There's a year in all our lives that only Jesus satisfies.
[time=390] Calvary's love will sail forever, bright and shiny, strong and free, like an arc of peace and safety.
[time=410] On a sea of human need, through the hours of all the ages, those tired of sailing on their own.
[time=429] Fine rest inside the shadow cast by Calvary's love across their soul.
[time=445] Calvary's love, Calvary's love, Christless gift, Christ makes us worthy of.
[time=458] The deepest sin can't rise above Calvary's love.
[time=479] Calvary's love can heal the spirit life has crushed and cast aside.
[time=492] And I do, into heaven's promise, fills with joyless empty eyes.
[time=505] So desired to tell the story of a love that loved enough to die,
[time=518] burns away all other passions.
[time=523] And fed by Calvary's love becomes a far.
[time=534] Calvary's love, Calvary's love, Christless gift, Christ makes us worthy of.
[time=547] The deepest sin can't rise above Calvary's love.
[time=574] Calvary's love has never faltered, all its wonders still remain.
[time=588] Exhale still take eternal passage, sings a tone, and heaven gained.
[time=601] Oh, I want to welcome you again to the Bible hour in our service.
[time=621] Hope you're enjoying your participation in our service today.
[time=625] Our senior pastor, Russell Moore, is enjoying a vacation with his wife Heidi and their five children.
[time=632] And we appreciate your continued prayers for he and his family and their ministry here in our church.
[time=638] We anticipate his coming back again this week and being with us in our service next week.
[time=643] I want to tell you about a couple new additions to our staff here at the church.
[time=648] Jean Cheryl is going to be joining our staff just in about another week.
[time=653] We'll be working in the ministry area of pastoral care with a special emphasis in our senior adult work.
[time=660] So be thinking of Jean and his work with us and be remembering him in your prayers.
[time=667] Just a couple weeks ago, Kip Klein and his wife Sarah started their work here at Blackhawk.
[time=674] Working in the area of student ministries, junior high, senior high, and college age students.
[time=680] And we've already enjoyed the enthusiasm they've been bringing to our staff and the work here.
[time=685] And again, would covet appreciate your prayers on their behalf as they continue to lay the groundwork
[time=691] and foundation for a new era in our student ministries here at Blackhawk.
[time=696] Those of you that are watching this program in Fort Wayne, especially on Sunday morning,
[time=702] just want to let you know that there is coming up later this very morning on July 2nd, 10 o'clock,
[time=708] a special program here at Blackhawk, the Patriotic Celebration.
[time=712] This is an annual event that we hold, and it is a very special presentation program
[time=718] that we'd like to invite you to be a part of.
[time=721] In this service, we will be celebrating God's work in America.
[time=726] And what he has done in the past, what he is doing currently, and what we anticipate and pray and long for God to do in our country in the future.
[time=734] Our theme this year is "We Hold These Truths." And through a presentation of music and multimedia, we will enjoy the celebration of God's work in our country.
[time=744] So we invite you, if you're not already plugged into a local church ministry, to come visit our church this morning, July 2nd, at the one service that we'll be having today.
[time=753] That's 10 a.m., and of course, it's free, there's no charge.
[time=757] I invite you to come and bring friends and family.
[time=760] In the next part of our service today, we are going to be focusing on the might and the power of God.
[time=768] Each week, Scott, our music director and myself, get together to plan the services that are going to be held two weeks down the road.
[time=775] And a couple weeks ago, we were planning this part of our worship service.
[time=780] And our music was centered around the might and the power of God, as you will hear in just a minute.
[time=788] Because of our focus on that planning meeting, and because of God's own work in my life, really in the past couple years, and challenging me to consider His power that's at work in my life, we decided to really make the rest of the service focused on that issue.
[time=805] So in the music, in the scripture reading, and in the message today, we are to consider the power of God.
[time=812] And I want you to know that God's promise to all of those of us who trust in Him, as that the same power that we are going to be describing today is at work in us, the power that raised Jesus Christ from the dead, is at work in the lives of those who trust in Him.
[time=829] So I just want to encourage you, as you listen to the music and you listen to the scripture and you listen to the message, really think and consider God's power at work in you.
[time=847] [MUSIC - 149 seconds]
[time=1008] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1015] [MUSIC - 39 seconds]
[time=1074] Well, as Scott and I a couple weeks ago sat down and preparing the order of worship this morning and put together, you know, the songs of worship that would focus on in on the power and the might of God, and knowing that I would be speaking this morning, I just thought it would be good to carry that theme through into the message today.
[time=1095] And so I want to focus on the power of God. Before I begin the message, let me just say a word about this past week because this has been a good week for me. This past week, my wife and I celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary and my wife wives take note of this.
[time=1114] My wife planned our anniversary celebration, told me to set certain dates aside on my calendar, and she made arrangements secretly and all of that stuff, and whisked me away down to Indianapolis for a few days, and we just had a great time.
[time=1129] One of the things that we did while we were there is went to concert by the Indianapolis Orchestra, Symphony Orchestra, over lunch. It was an indoor brown bag orchestra lunch, and you could either bring your lunch or buy your brown bag lunch there.
[time=1146] And as I sat down preparing for the event and looking over the songs that they would be playing, and then someone came out and introduced the conductor, I quickly flipped to the back of my program, and with maybe a sense of disappointment leaned over to my wife and said, "No, this isn't the real conductor, this is just one of his assistants, but maybe he'll be okay anyway," and sat up, and about five seconds it struck me.
[time=1169] That's probably very much what happens on a Sunday morning when I step up to the public. People are going, "Oh, well, this isn't the real pastor, but maybe he'll be okay anyway."
[time=1180] Well, so it was good for me to get a little taste of what goes on in the mind, so I know, I know those things happen.
[time=1188] Well, I always appreciate the opportunity to be able to teach and to just talk about God's truth.
[time=1195] Have you ever been really amazed by power? I mean, I think it's in the everyday course of living, we are surrounded with objects of power that we pretty much take for granted, but when I stop to think that I can get into a vehicle and take a jagged piece of metal, stick it into a hole, turn it.
[time=1214] And all of a sudden, I mean, this power goes into play that I certainly, being as unmechanical as I am, certainly don't understand, and yet I can hit pedals and move gears so that I can be speeding down the highway at 60 miles an hour.
[time=1231] I mean, there's power that play there, and when I sit in a tube of metal on a landing strip, little flat wings coming out the side, and maybe hundreds of other people getting on that plane with me, and power goes into play that lifts us above the surface of the earth, above the clouds and keeps us in the air, I mean, I don't understand that, but I know that's power.
[time=1257] And that even pales in comparison to the power when the space shuttle takes off and goes into orbit around the earth. There's power there.
[time=1267] When you think of a storm, and some of you perhaps have been in the middle of storms, in which you were amazed by the power that was demonstrated there.
[time=1277] A few years ago when that wind shear cut through the neighborhood of Blackhawk came pressing against our front doors, the double front doors of our home, and literally blew them open.
[time=1291] You know, I came falling, tumbling down the steps in an attempt to try to shut the doors, as all kinds of stuff was blowing in.
[time=1297] I mean, it was a tremendous, awesome force, demonstration of power that was at play, and there were people who were members of this church that were sitting in their homes in that storm who watched their home disintegrate before their eyes because of the power of that storm.
[time=1313] And even that pales in comparison to the earthquakes and the tornadoes, the volcanic eruptions that have happened around the world were sometimes over thousands of people have died because of the power.
[time=1326] The power of a bomb certainly realized that the people of Oklahoma City this past April, when early in the morning all sudden, percussion swept through that town that literally rocked the foundation of that city.
[time=1344] And we've seen the pictures over and over again of a building that was just half of it wiped right out, over 150 deaths because of the power of a man-made bomb in the back of a van.
[time=1356] And then consider the pictures of Hiroshima that we've seen, and a bomb dropped in the 1940s that killed over 150,000 people.
[time=1364] I mean, there's power there, and then to consider the power of the bombs that we have at our disposal today that are even greater than that. I mean, there's power.
[time=1376] I remember being very young and having one of my first encounters with power, receiving somewhat of an education as a young boy in my bedroom looking into little holes in the wall.
[time=1387] And I'd learned by now that when you put things into those holes, they work in ways that they don't normally work. Lights come on, things run, fans move.
[time=1396] And I was just curious about it. I was curious about what made those things work. And so I went to my closet and got a hanger out, and kids don't try this at home.
[time=1405] Then it opened and inserted it into one of the holes and immediately received a shock. And gained a new appreciation of power in my life that day.
[time=1418] Today I want to talk about another kind of power shock. In fact, if we could, we'd give this capital P, capital S, power shock.
[time=1427] And by definition, when I'm talking about power shocks this morning, I'm referring to high impact encounters with the power of God. High impact encounters with the power of God.
[time=1439] And my purpose this morning, because we're going to just look at a number of power shocks throughout scripture, and my purpose is simply to remind us and impact us may be anew with the awesomeness of God's power.
[time=1454] As our jumping off point, our foundation foot we'll talk about today, would you turn to Psalm chapter 89?
[time=1460] Here the psalmist is writing and praise to God. In a portion of this psalm, I see four kinds of power shock mentioned, four categories.
[time=1472] And there are others that we could mention, but we're going to focus in on these four.
[time=1479] And the first one, beginning at verse 5, is simply being shocked by the power of God's presence.
[time=1487] Psalm 89, beginning at verse 5, follow with me as I read, says, "The heavens praise your wonders, O Lord, your faithfulness too, in the assembly of the holy ones.
[time=1498] For who in the skies can compare with the Lord? Who is like the Lord among the heavenly beings?
[time=1503] In the counsel of the holy ones, God is greatly feared. He is more awesome than all who surround him.
[time=1510] O Lord God Almighty, who is like you, you are mighty, O Lord, and your faithfulness surrounds you."
[time=1520] When I read this passage, the picture that I am reminded of is the picture of Isaiah, as he describes it in Isaiah chapter 6, of being wished away into the throne room of God,
[time=1532] standing in the very presence of God. Before we consider that familiar scene, let me just ask you to imagine something else.
[time=1542] Imagine that today, as you went home, an envelope was brought to your home, special delivery.
[time=1550] On the outside of the envelope, simply the return address simply said, "White House," and it had your name on the front.
[time=1557] As you opened that envelope, took it out, you saw that it was an invitation. It was an invitation to visit with the President of the United States tomorrow afternoon.
[time=1565] And so you prepare, and tomorrow morning up to your house, polls a limousine, and you go into that limousine ride to the Fort Wayne International Airport,
[time=1575] where Air Force One is standing there waiting to take you to Washington, and you fly there, and they take you to the White House,
[time=1582] and usher you into the Oval Office, and their seat behind his desk is the President of the United States.
[time=1589] Now, I'll just be honest, if that were happened to me, there'd be somewhat of an awesomeness to that.
[time=1596] Because of the man, and because of his position, I have great respect for him in standing in the presence of the President of the United States,
[time=1604] and standing on the Oval Office would be something spectacular for me.
[time=1610] But as great as that experience might be, it pales as though insignificant when compared to what happened to Isaiah.
[time=1622] You don't need to turn there, but let me just remind you that of what Isaiah says.
[time=1628] In Isaiah 6, he says, "I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, lofting exalted with the train of his robe, filling the temple."
[time=1637] And Isaiah goes on to describe some of the other things he saw there.
[time=1640] He describes the seraphim, who are heavenly beings, and they were surrounding the throne, and with one pair of wings they flew,
[time=1648] with another pair of wings they covered their face, with another pair of wings they covered their feet.
[time=1653] And over and over again, they were speaking, or singing the phrase, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty."
[time=1664] And the very foundations of that play shook with their voice.
[time=1668] And Isaiah, standing in the presence of God, certainly had a power shock.
[time=1676] In fact, we read his response, we see the impact of this encounter.
[time=1682] Isaiah said, "Then I said, 'Woe is me, for I am ruined.'" And that ruined literally means to be undone, to be unwound, to come unglued, to come apart at the seams.
[time=1693] I mean, so powerful was his encounter with this presence of God that Isaiah had the sense that he was just going to fall apart.
[time=1701] And he realized his own sinfulness, and called down doom upon himself.
[time=1709] He says, "For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord God of hosts." It was a high impact encounter with the power of God, specifically the power of God's presence, that also resulted in Isaiah being totally surrendered to God.
[time=1724] Because when God says, "Who do we have to send on our behalf?" Isaiah at this point just says, "Here am I, send me." Shocked by the power of God's presence.
[time=1734] I think it's the same kind of power shock that the disciples, Peter, James and John, experienced when they went up on a mountain with Jesus one day.
[time=1742] Stories in Matthew chapter 17, we call it the Mount of Transfiguration, because while they were standing up there, and I don't think they were prepared for this, all of a sudden with Jesus, there were two other individual standing, Moses and Elijah.
[time=1756] And it said that there was a radiance about Jesus, there was a brilliance about him.
[time=1761] I mean, there was a whiteness about him that was unexplainable.
[time=1766] When Jesus left heaven to come to earth, he clothed himself with this human suit, and veiled the glory that he naturally possesses his God the Son.
[time=1777] But on that place, in that time, he uncovered some of that.
[time=1781] And Peter, James and John saw something of the glory of God when they looked at Jesus Christ.
[time=1786] Now, I don't know if you've ever been someplace, and you've been so nervously frightened that you didn't even know what to say, or perhaps you stuttered out something that didn't even make sense.
[time=1795] Linda was a girl when I was growing up that I really admired.
[time=1803] She lived four houses down from me, and I often thought that Linda would be the perfect girl to be my girlfriend.
[time=1810] And I remember one day leaving my house and going to her front door and knocking on the door, and I don't know if I had anything prepared to say, but I know when she came to the door, everything left me.
[time=1824] And I was so nervous and so frightful.
[time=1827] What I ended up doing was putting my hands over my ear so I didn't have to hear my own voice.
[time=1832] And saying something like, "Dream, dream, dream, all I have to do is dream," and I ran away.
[time=1837] I'm sure that really impressed her.
[time=1841] But inside, I mean, it was kind of that nervous fear that just caused me to bumble out something.
[time=1847] And I think that's something of what Peter must have been experiencing because he encounters this unexpected event and seeing the power of God's presence in Jesus Christ.
[time=1857] And as was Peter's way, he decides to speak.
[time=1861] And what comes out, it tells us in Mark, isn't really what Peter necessarily meant to say.
[time=1867] He didn't know what he was saying because he was so fearful.
[time=1869] What he ended up saying was something like, "Well, Jesus, it's really good that we're here to see this." And Jesus, if you'd like, with my own hands, I'm going to put up three little tents here, three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moses and Elijah.
[time=1881] And you guys can just stay here and maybe other people can come up and they can see what we've seen.
[time=1887] Well, if that encounter with the presence of God wasn't enough, at that point, God the Father descends in the form of a brilliant cloud and surrounds them and speaks out of the cloud.
[time=1898] And in effect says, "Hey Peter, why don't you just be quiet?
[time=1903] This is my son in whom I am well pleased, listened to him, and by this time they'd had enough.
[time=1910] They'd fallen flat on the ground on their faces because of fearfulness, because they encountered the power of God's presence.
[time=1918] Power shock, high impact encounter with the power of God.
[time=1925] There's another kind of power shock that I think Psalmist writes about in this song, beginning at verse 9.
[time=1931] He says, "You rule over the surging sea when its waves mount up, you still them.
[time=1937] You crushed Rahab like one of the slain with your strong arm, you scattered your enemies, shocked by the power of God's authority."
[time=1946] Now, when you read this name Rahab, you may think of the prostitute in Jericho who helped the spies, but actually the title and the name Rahab is used a number of times in Scripture to refer to a powerful enemy of God.
[time=1959] And sometimes it's a reference to a demonic monster, sometimes it's a reference to a nation who stands as opposed to God's people Israel, but it's an enemy of God.
[time=1969] And this passage talks about the authority of God over the elements of creation and over the enemies of God themselves.
[time=1978] Now, again, let me make a contemporary comparison here.
[time=1982] And I use the figure of Bill Gates.
[time=1984] He's someone I talk about, he's someone I enjoy reading about.
[time=1987] He's just an interesting person to me, probably because he's about my age, and yet is worth over $10 billion, possibly the richest man in the United States.
[time=1996] Well, that says something.
[time=1998] He founded Microsoft.
[time=2000] 80% of the world's computers are run by his software system.
[time=2004] He's the head of, you know, gigantic one of the most successful corporations in the world.
[time=2009] And you can bet when he speaks and when he makes decisions, it has impacts and has authority around the world, especially in the area of technology.
[time=2019] In fact, such was his authority that when he got married, I think sometime last year, he really didn't want to be bugged by a lot of people around him.
[time=2028] So he just rented one of the Hawaiian Islands and just kind of bought the place out.
[time=2032] I mean, transportation systems and everything, just so they could enjoy a quiet little time together.
[time=2037] I mean, that's power.
[time=2038] That's kind of authority.
[time=2040] But again, it's nothing compared to the authority of God.
[time=2046] Now, let me just, again, remind you of some power shock stories from Scripture that you've heard before, but we need to be reminded of.
[time=2055] 1 Samuel chapter 5, the Philistines are in battle against the Israelites, and the Israelites really aren't following God.
[time=2063] And they take it upon themselves to go get the Ark of the Covenant, which was the object that God had told them to build.
[time=2070] It was the place where his presence especially dwelt.
[time=2076] And they decided to go to the Ark of the Covenant and bring it into battle with them because they felt that would guarantee the victory for them.
[time=2081] Well, they got the Ark of the Covenant, brought it to battle, and they lost.
[time=2085] And Scripture says the Philistines, seizing the opportunity, took the Ark of the Covenant back with them as one of their spoils of war.
[time=2093] And they took the Ark of the Covenant and they went and placed it before the image, the statue of their God, Daegon.
[time=2100] So here they take the Ark of the Covenant into the temple of Daegon and place it before their God as an expression of worship to their God.
[time=2108] Scripture says that it came back the next morning, and the idol had toppled forward and was bowing before the Ark of the Covenant,
[time=2115] which was a little bit embarrassing to the priest of their religion.
[time=2117] So they quickly hoisted that up before anybody saw and put it back in a place, a freak thing, maybe that happened.
[time=2123] Well, Scripture goes on to say that the next morning they came in, it says that they saw again that there was Daegon falling on his face on the ground before the Ark of the Lord.
[time=2131] His head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold, only his body remained.
[time=2137] And God began to do some other things in demonstrating his authority to the people.
[time=2141] So they came to the point where they said, "Hey, we need to get rid of this thing.
[time=2145] The authority and the power of God is too strong." Power shock, high impact encounter with the power of God.
[time=2153] The disciples had the same kind of power shock when they recognized the authority of God seen in Jesus Christ.
[time=2160] Very familiar story of them being in a boat, other boats along with them too, night time traveling across the water and suddenly a storm sweeps across.
[time=2169] I mean, it is so violent that the disciples are fearful, they're afraid they're going to die.
[time=2175] Jesus is sleeping in the boat.
[time=2177] Out of desperation, finally they go and they wake him up and they say, "Jesus, don't you care?
[time=2182] We're about to die. We don't have any hope. Is there anything you can do?"
[time=2188] Well, in the fantasy stories of today, you might have the magician getting up and conjuring all kinds of things and preparing for some kind of incantation that he can mumble out
[time=2198] and see if he can appease the storms up.
[time=2200] It simply says that Jesus stood up and said, "Peace be still." That's all.
[time=2206] Peace be still and immediately the wind, the water died down.
[time=2213] It has a rather significant encounter with the power of God's authority.
[time=2217] And the impact it had on the life of disciples, scripture says that they were terrified and asked each other,
[time=2223] "Who is this that even the wind and the waves obey him?" There's a power shock.
[time=2230] When Jesus went through his ministry and cast out demons and healed the illness and sicknesses of people,
[time=2236] it says that the people who encountered those demonstrations of God's authority were amazed and awestruck,
[time=2242] and they praised the God of Israel.
[time=2246] And that same authority was given to the apostles. Jesus said, "The power of my spirit will come on you after I leave."
[time=2253] And it did.
[time=2254] And there were demonstrations of the authority of God through the apostles as they went about healing the sick and doing miracles.
[time=2262] And it says that all who witnessed that were amazed and filled with awe.
[time=2268] And countering the power of God and seeing his authority at work produces in us an effect that is awesome.
[time=2277] That is fearful of a God who's capable of such might and authority and power.
[time=2284] Back to Psalm 89, we move to the next verses and I think a third kind of power shock.
[time=2289] Not just being shocked by the power of God's presence or the power of God's authority, but here we see being shocked by the power of God's creation.
[time=2295] Look at verses 11 and 12, "The heavens are yours and yours also the earth.
[time=2299] You founded the world and all that is in it.
[time=2302] You created the north and the south, Tabor and Herman, which are names of mountains,
[time=2308] sing for joy at your name, shocked by the power of God's creation." Now this is one encounter with God's power that everyone experiences.
[time=2318] You experience it, I experience it.
[time=2321] Many times we get kind of blase about it, no big deal, but we experience it every day when we look around us and see what God has done and what he has made.
[time=2329] No one will be able to stand before God and say, "God, if I'd only known, if somehow you would have demonstrated your awesome power in a way that I could have seen,
[time=2339] maybe I would have believed you more." No excuse because God has done that.
[time=2344] He has displayed the awesome power of his creation that evidence is available to us every day of our lives.
[time=2351] I can think of times in my own life when I have had personal power shocks in regards to the power of God's creation.
[time=2357] And you probably have to, I hope you have, to stand out in mind.
[time=2361] One was during a summer when I was on a missions trip in Europe, and on one night I was camped outside with my team along the Mediterranean seashore.
[time=2371] We were a distance from any city, so there were no artificial lights anywhere near us.
[time=2376] We just camped out in the Mediterranean Sea, and that night was perfectly clear, and I have never been able to see the immensity of God's creation
[time=2386] and the galaxies and the stars and the billions of billions of stuff that's out there.
[time=2391] And I can't even describe the sense of all that came over me at a being that could create something so vast
[time=2400] and so wonderful and so beautiful.
[time=2404] There's power shock.
[time=2406] And another time, more recently, in Colorado attending a conference and taking time out, just to spend an afternoon walking, and found a ravine that I began heading down.
[time=2416] I'd never been there before. I didn't know where it would lead and spent maybe an hour and a half walking down this ravine.
[time=2420] And when I came around one bend, I was just met with this waterfall.
[time=2426] It was beautiful.
[time=2428] It's something that I would have paid to go see.
[time=2430] And here, I just kind of discovered it by accident.
[time=2433] And again, it was power shock.
[time=2435] I mean, to realize this is something that God has made.
[time=2439] And I spent time in that little basin with the waters coming behind me, just singing out and praising God.
[time=2445] No one else around to hear me except the audience of God himself.
[time=2449] I was just overwhelmed with the power of God's creation.
[time=2453] The psalmist expressed it this way in Psalm 33.
[time=2457] "By the word of the Lord where the heavens made, there's starry host by the breath of his mouth.
[time=2462] Let all the earth fear the Lord, let all the people of the world revere him, for he spoke and it came to be, he commanded, and it stood firm.
[time=2471] High impact encounter with the power of God's creation should leave us with a sense of awe and reverence and worship because of who God is." Do we forget that?
[time=2482] We do.
[time=2483] And we have come so commonplace to us.
[time=2486] We forget to be lost in the wonder of what God has created and the power that that demonstrates.
[time=2493] Let me mention one other power shock that I think is suggested in the Psalm 89
[time=2500] passage beginning at verse 14.
[time=2503] "Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.
[time=2507] Love and faithfulness go before you.
[time=2509] Blessed are those who have learned to acclaim you who walk in the light of your presence, O Lord.
[time=2514] They rejoice in your name all day long.
[time=2516] They exalt in your righteousness.
[time=2517] For you are their glory and strength, and by your favor you exalt our horn.
[time=2522] Indeed our shield belongs to the Lord, our king to the holy one of Israel." The psalmist recognizes that the power of Israel is not in its own strength,
[time=2533] its own protection, its own king, its own armies, but its power and protection comes from God.
[time=2540] And I think the fourth power shock I mentioned here is being shocked by the power of God's protection, His protection for His people.
[time=2549] I mean it had to be this kind of power shock that met the people of Israel as they finally were escaping from Egypt.
[time=2557] They'd lived in Egypt over 400 years, most of that is slaves.
[time=2561] God has sent a deliver of Moses in to bring them out of captivity and they make their way out of Egypt and now they are on the shores of the Red Sea.
[time=2570] And in the meantime Pharaoh changes his mind, gathers together 600 chariots, puts together an army to pursue the Israelites, to capture them and bring them back.
[time=2580] So they're on the shore of the Red Sea and they see Pharaoh coming and they become fearful.
[time=2585] And you know the story.
[time=2587] I mean you've read it, you've seen the Charlton Heston movie, you know what happens here, the jello departed.
[time=2593] The water of the Red Sea, God caused to open up so that the people of Israel could walk across dry ground.
[time=2601] Scripture tells us that the presence of God in the form of a pillar went and actually came between the people of Israel and the Egyptian army.
[time=2608] So that during the night as the Israelites walked across and God gave them daylight to see, light to see, the Pharaoh and his army were kept in darkness.
[time=2618] And it says in the last watch of the night it was becoming morning.
[time=2622] Pharaoh begins to pursue the Israelites through this opening, this gap in the Red Sea.
[time=2628] I don't know I would have been a little fearful of that myself, but they obeyed Pharaoh's commands and started pursuing them.
[time=2636] It says that God from the presence of his pillar and by his power caused chaos to happen in Pharaoh's army.
[time=2644] And here we're at one time this well disciplined, this well oiled army of chariots
[time=2650] pursuing the Israelites in perfect formation was going along.
[time=2654] Now all of a sudden wheels started falling off the chariots.
[time=2656] People began stumbling into one another, falling into heaps, all kinds of confusion and chaos.
[time=2661] It turned into something that resembled more of a Keystone Cop movie than the disciplined army of Pharaoh.
[time=2667] And once Israel was safe across the other side, God's power again came into play.
[time=2673] Moses held his hands over the water and the walls of water rushed in and destroyed Pharaoh's army completely.
[time=2679] And it goes on to tell us that it did have impact in the life of the people.
[time=2685] It says, "And when the Israelites saw the great power of the Lord displayed among the Egyptians the people feared the Lord and put their trust in him." And I say, "Well yeah, I think I would too." High impact encounter with the power of God's protection.
[time=2701] I love the story in 2 Kings.
[time=2704] There's this king of Aram who is trying to get the king of Israel.
[time=2710] And he puts all his plots into place and trying to set an ambush for the king of Israel's army.
[time=2717] He sets up ambush after ambush, but as soon as he gets his guys organized and hiding behind the rocks
[time=2723] and waiting for the king of Israel to come, the king of Israel comes up to the spot and they turn away and they go a different course.
[time=2729] He's never able to surprise them or ambush him and this frustrates him to the point that he brings in his leaders
[time=2735] and say, "Okay, I want to know which of you is working for the king of Israel.
[time=2739] Who is the spy among us?" And his leaders say, "Okay, none of us are spies. It's that prophet Elisha." He tells the king where you are waiting and ambush.
[time=2750] In fact, God tells him the very words you speak in your own bedroom.
[time=2755] Power of God's protection? Well, this didn't make the king really happy.
[time=2760] And his next course of action says, "Well, if I can get rid of this prophet, then maybe I can put my ambushes in place and they'll work." So he sends out spies to find out where the prophet Elisha is staying.
[time=2769] They discover that he's staying in a certain town.
[time=2772] So the king of Aram puts together a strong group of soldiers and chariots and officers
[time=2781] and sends them off to the town. And they surround this town.
[time=2786] And the next morning, when Elisha's servant wakes up, he looks out.
[time=2791] And here's what Scripture says in 1 Kings 8, 2 Kings 8.
[time=2794] It says, "When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early, the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city.
[time=2801] And the servant said, "Oh, my Lord, what shall we do?" He says to Elisha.
[time=2807] Elisha's response was, "Don't be afraid.
[time=2810] Those who are with us are more than those who are with them." Now, this didn't make sense to the servant.
[time=2817] He looked at Elisha. He looked at himself.
[time=2820] He looked over the walls of the city and saw a vast army and maybe he thought the prophet was going a little bit nuts at this point because they were certainly outnumbered.
[time=2831] And Elisha simply prays this. Elisha says, "O Lord, open his eyes so he may see."
[time=2837] And the Bible says that the eyes of the servant were open and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
[time=2847] I mean, that's cool. That's better than a Steven Spielberg movie.
[time=2851] I mean, for a moment, God opens the veil to the supernatural world, to what's normally invisible to us, and that servant sees the protection of God and the power of God's protection surrounding Elisha in the city.
[time=2864] Man, that was a power shock.
[time=2868] You know the story of Shadrach, Meshanach and Abednego thrown into a blazing furnace because they would not bow down to an idol that Nebuchadnezzar had made.
[time=2876] And Nebuchadnezzar, waiting for them to die, looks into the flame and grabs someone here and says, "How many do we throw in there?" Three, that's what I thought, but there are four.
[time=2888] And the fourth one looks like a son of a God.
[time=2893] And he calls them out of the fire and they come out untouched, unhurt.
[time=2899] Nebuchadnezzar had a power shock, a high impact encounter with the power of God
[time=2905] and the protection of God's people.
[time=2908] And Nebuchadnezzar responded this way, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego who has sent his angel and rescued his servants." And he said a decree that no one was to talk against this most powerful God.
[time=2922] I believe that when we have encounters with the power of God,
[time=2932] it will have impact in our life.
[time=2935] And as we've seen the impact of fear of the awesomeness of God's power, or reverence and worship and praise because of who God is, gratefulness for his protection.
[time=2946] Somehow it's going to cause some response in the life of God's people
[time=2952] when we remember his power, when we encounter his power.
[time=2958] I hope this psalm and the stories that we've been reminded of have been a reminder to you of the awesomeness of God's power.
[time=2966] I mean, this is real.
[time=2967] This is not just something Old Testament, even New Testament.
[time=2970] This is something now.
[time=2972] God is now.
[time=2973] He's the same God of power now.
[time=2975] He may not be parting Lake Michigan, but he's the same God of power.
[time=2981] I just have a question to ask that I don't know if there's going to be an uncomfortable question to you or not, but I ask it anyway.
[time=2986] Have you experienced any power shocks in your life?
[time=2992] Have you had any high impact encounters with the power of God in your life?
[time=2999] Maybe it's been power shocks in regards to God's creation, where you have just been so overwhelmed with what God has made
[time=3009] and what that tells us about him.
[time=3013] Maybe you've experienced the power of God's salvation in your life, and you have known the power of a changed life that only God could do.
[time=3023] Maybe you've experienced the power of God's Word.
[time=3027] Maybe you've experienced the power of God's miraculous works, and you've seen something that can only be explained by the power of God.
[time=3034] I don't know.
[time=3037] Have you experienced power shocks because I believe that in one way or another, and for some of you, maybe more than others, there have been demonstrations of God's power in our lives.
[time=3048] Well, have you remembered those, or do you forget?
[time=3051] Have you forgotten the evidences of God's power in your life?
[time=3054] Let me get a little more specific.
[time=3057] Today, on June 25, 1995, are you being impacted by the power of God?
[time=3064] Is your life impacted by his power?
[time=3067] Do you pray with an awareness of God's power?
[time=3071] When you pray, are you aware of the power of God?
[time=3076] Do you believe that God is able to do what you ask?
[time=3080] Do you believe that God is capable, abable of doing it?
[time=3083] Do you pray safe, or do you pray risky?
[time=3086] By safe prayers, I mean those prayers that really we know we can do ourselves, or kind of can be explained away, or do you pray risky prayers?
[time=3096] Ask God to do things that only God can do.
[time=3102] Do you worship with awareness of God's power?
[time=3106] Whether it's private worship, or when you come into this church, who do you think of?
[time=3111] Who are you singing for?
[time=3116] Do we sing our courses and our hymns with an awareness that God is our audience?
[time=3120] We're not his audience, he is our audience, and we are offering up our praise and worship to him.
[time=3125] Do you come with a mindset that your worship is a worship of getting?
[time=3130] I want to come and worship so I can get something out of this, or is it a sense of worship that is giving to God, which is what worship ought to be?
[time=3140] And it doesn't matter what form you use, I mean I don't care if you're worshiping fast, or worshiping slow, or worshiping loud, or worshiping soft, or worshiping with your hands raised, or your hands down, standing kneeling, falling.
[time=3155] A worship is what comes out of our heart and expression to God.
[time=3158] Do you worship with awareness that God is a powerful God, and it's him that we worship?
[time=3166] Do you live with an awareness of God's power?
[time=3169] Have you experienced God's power in a changed life?
[time=3173] Do you recognize the work of God's power around us every day?
[time=3178] Do you understand that God's power is in you, and if you get nothing else as we come to the end of this service,
[time=3185] understand this that is a believer, as a Christian, the same power of God that we've been talking about, the same power of God that raised Jesus Christ from the dead, God promises is in you and is in me.
[time=3196] Now I admit, I don't understand all of that.
[time=3200] There are times in my life where I just hunger for God to teach me more and help me understand what it means
[time=3206] to have the available to me, the power of his spirit in my life.
[time=3210] But God says it is true.
[time=3213] Ephesians 1 verses 18 and 19, Paul says, "I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you,
[time=3222] the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints, and his incomparably great power for us who believe."
[time=3230] His incomparably great power for us who believe.
[time=3235] To be honest, sometimes I look at my life and I look at the life of Christians and I wonder what is the difference between them and the people outside God's family?
[time=3244] When I see the way that I struggle with sin, the way that I pursue holiness, sometimes it doesn't seem to be that much different from the way even a non-Christian tries to break bad habits or tries to live a good life.
[time=3255] And I believe God intends more than that for us because his power is in our life.
[time=3261] A.W. Tozier once said this prayer when he was considering the power of God.
[time=3268] "Our Heavenly Father," he prayed, "we have heard these say, 'I am the Almighty God, walk before me and be perfect, but unless you enable us by the exceeding greatness of your power, how can we who are by nature weak and sinful walk in a perfect way?
[time=3284] Teach us to lay hold of that mighty power which was at work when thou raised Christ from the dead
[time=3290] and set him at thine own right hand in the heavenly places." I want to conclude our service in a way that's a little bit different than we normally do today.
[time=3299] I mean, first of all, say that if you are here this morning and somehow have been impacted by a reminder of the powerfulness of God.
[time=3307] And maybe you have some need in your life.
[time=3309] You'd like someone to talk with you or pray with you or you'd like to have information about joining the church or baptism or whatever.
[time=3314] I'm going to be available up front.
[time=3316] We have counselors who are going to be available.
[time=3318] There will be someone available in the room right through those doors that call the harvest room.
[time=3322] Please see one of us and we'd enjoy the opportunity to talk with you.
[time=3325] But what I'd like to do in closing the service is just take a couple minutes of silence.
[time=3329] I don't want the instruments to play.
[time=3331] I'd prefer if you can just wait and not leave as we go through a couple minutes of just silence before God.
[time=3338] And as we just bow before God in silence, I want to remind you of the things we've considered today in regard to His power.
[time=3344] And you just think about those and you offer up to God whatever you need to offer up.
[time=3348] Maybe it's worship and praise to Him.
[time=3350] Perhaps it's a yielding a new to this awesome God of power.
[time=3354] And getting some things settled, I don't know.
[time=3357] If I invite you now just to bow your heads and we're going to just take a moment of silence.
[time=3361] And you and God, you and this powerful God just let Him deal with you in the way He will.
[time=3368] Let me close our program with a special word to those of you who are watching via television.
[time=3385] We've been considering the might and the power of God.
[time=3389] And perhaps some of you realize that you really have no relationship with this kind of God.
[time=3395] Kind of God that stands over us and has control over the universe in fact our own lives.
[time=3402] I just want you to know that God gives you the invitation to have a personal relationship with Him through Jesus Christ.
[time=3409] And if you'd like to know more about that, I invite you to write us.
[time=3412] But perhaps you're at the place even today when you would like to give your life to God.
[time=3418] Really all you need to do is with the honesty and simplicity of your own heart just express that desire to God.
[time=3425] And it might be words something like the prayer that I'd like to pray with you.
[time=3429] The words themselves aren't important again.
[time=3431] It's the honesty of your heart and your communication to God.
[time=3435] But if you'd like to, you can pray along this prayer with me and simply say this to God.
[time=3442] Father, I realize that you are an awesome powerful mighty God.
[time=3446] As I've considered these truths this morning, I realize that as I stand before you, I have significant need in my life.
[time=3454] Thank you for the provision you've made through Jesus Christ.
[time=3457] And I accept His death as a sacrifice for my sin.
[time=3461] And I give my life totally to you.
[time=3464] Please make of me whatever you want.
[time=3466] I submit to you and thank you and praise you for loving me and doing all that you have done.
[time=3473] In Christ's name, amen.
