[time=0] >>Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour today and invite
[time=7] you to participate as we celebrate our freedom here in the United States of America.
[time=12] This is a special patriotic celebration and we're going to just enjoy the wonder and the
[time=18] privilege of being American citizens and knowing the freedom that we have.
[time=23] So stay with us and we trust you'll enjoy this wonderful time together.

[time=1452] In 1954, Dwight Eisenhower signed into law the Congressional Act, which added the words under God to the Pledge of Allegiance. He said, "In this way, we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America's heritage and future. In this way, we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons, which forever will be our country's
[time=1471] most powerful resource in peace and war." On the occasion of the enactment of the Equal Access Bill of 1984, Ronald Reagan stated in his address, lawsuits were brought to abolish the words under God from the Pledge of Allegiance, and to remove and God we trust from public documents and from our currency. Without God, democracy cannot and will not long endure. If we ever forget that we are one nation under God, then we will be a nation under God.
[time=1500] We will be a nation, God under.
[time=1503] [MUSIC - 211 seconds]
[time=1744] [APPLAUSE]
[time=1754] One nation under God, we hold these truths. It's quite a distance from the feather quill on parchment that recorded the Declaration of Independence to the laser printer I used today. Things have definitely changed, but not all changes have been good.
[time=1769] That's right. Whatever happened, a good old fashioned honesty. And where are the men whose firm handshake or solemn word was all it took to seal it deal? When did we start not trusting each other?
[time=1781] Liberty, justice, freedom, truth, are they just the by words of our past? Or are they still the foundations upon which we stand?
[time=1795] [MUSIC]
[time=1805] I used to believe with all of my heart in the land of the brave and the free.
[time=1819] I used to think every man had a right to be what he wanted to be.
[time=1834] And I used to think every nation should stand for God and right.
[time=1849] And I used to believe that the Patriots creed should be freedom at any price.
[time=1867] And I still do. I still believe the truth.
[time=1883] I've always believed in the red, white, and blue. And I still do.
[time=1897] America, I still believe in you.
[time=1910] [MUSIC]
[time=1918] I used to get a lump in my throat every time I'd see old glory weigh.
[time=1932] I used to cry when I read about the lies for our freedom so many have paid.
[time=1947] And I used to stand so proud when I hear someone sing.
[time=1956] Oh, say can you see.
[time=1962] I used to believe I'd be willing to die to defend our name to you.
[time=1976] [MUSIC]
[time=1980] And I still do.
[time=1989] I still believe the truth.
[time=1995] I've always believed in the red, white, and blue.
[time=2004] And I still do.
[time=2010] Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave?
[time=2028] I've always believed in the red, white, and blue.
[time=2033] And I still do.
[time=2045] America, I still believe in you.
[time=2053] I still believe in you.
[time=2088] [APPLAUSE]
[time=2097] As Americans, we stand for the freedoms purchased by the very blood of our forefathers.
[time=2103] And as believers, purchased by the blood of our Savior Jesus Christ, we stand for righteousness and godliness.
[time=2109] May our children and grandchildren and the generations to come join us as we take the message of spiritual freedom and truth to our world.
[time=2118] Each of us can echo this timeless prayer of Solomon, the ancient king who prayed for and received the gift of wisdom.
[time=2127] The Lord our God will be with us as he was with our fathers.
[time=2130] May he not leave us or forsake us, so he may incline our hearts toward him to walk in all his ways.
[time=2137] So the people of the world will know that the Lord is God. There is no other.
[time=2167] He will always rule.
[time=2175] So by the time we will stand, joining hearts, joining hands.
[time=2183] We're a horse that stands strong and true.
[time=2193] If the light is forever, if the light is forever, we will be through.
[time=2213] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[time=2234] We always have.
[time=2247] (Applause)
[time=2260] Well, as you think about freedom, I wonder what comes to your mind.
[time=2265] As I was driving home from our family vacation where I've partly lost my voice, my apologies,
[time=2271] coming up through Tennessee and Kentucky seeing a couple of different states and a couple of different people watching these two states just yesterday,
[time=2279] kind of getting ready for the Fourth of July holiday.
[time=2281] Everybody's in their campers and their driving places and they're pulling their boats and they're buying their supplies and the flags are out and the feeling is there.
[time=2289] What I saw as I looked at my little slice of America these last few days, and when I thought about freedom, I thought about a very simple thing.
[time=2300] To be free in America is to be able to make a choice and then to pursue that direction, to choose and to pursue.
[time=2309] When you're free, you have the privilege of looking at a variety of different options and choosing one of them and then giving yourself to go after that choice.
[time=2322] Freedom doesn't guarantee success.
[time=2325] Freedom doesn't mean there may never be failure or hardship or difficulty.
[time=2329] Freedom simply means I get to choose and then I get to pursue.
[time=2338] Three weeks ago, I was sitting at lunch with some friends and one of the friends handed me this little book and I read the title of it says this.
[time=2348] A guide to the study of the Old and New Testament is now being a pastor that didn't shock me.
[time=2353] It's not uncommon for people to give me Bible books.
[time=2356] A guide to the study of the Old and New Testament is what shocked me was the subtitle.
[time=2361] Right underneath it says this for use in the high schools of Indiana, for use in the high schools of Indiana.
[time=2370] And that took me back and I have to confess that I pretty much checked out of the conversation that everybody else was having at lunch.
[time=2376] And I started looking at the book and inside it said approved by the Indiana State Board of Education June 1926.
[time=2385] Amazing. A lot has happened to the youth of America, to the high school students of America since the June of 1926.
[time=2397] A textbook like this would not be allowed in a public school or in a public setting.
[time=2402] I got even more engrossed in it and I began to look through the introductory chapter and there were quotes from former presidents.
[time=2410] One by George Washington I won't read to you is kind of lengthy. Here listen to John Quincy Adams.
[time=2416] Quote, "The first and almost the only book deserving of universal attention is the Bible.
[time=2424] I speak as a man of the world to men of the world and I say to you quote search the scriptures.
[time=2430] The earlier my children begin to read it the more confident will be my hopes that they will prove useful citizens for the country
[time=2439] and respectable members of society." Andrew Jackson said this speaking of the Bible.
[time=2445] It is the rock on which our republic rests. William McKinley said this,
[time=2451] "The more profoundly we study this wonderful book and the more closely we observe its divine precepts,
[time=2458] the better citizens we will become and the higher will be our destiny as a nation."
[time=2465] Woodrow Wilson quote, "There are a good many problems before the American people today and before me as president
[time=2475] but I expect to find the solution of these problems just in the proportion that I am faithful to study the word of God."
[time=2485] Isn't that amazing? Warren Harding said this, "I believe in religious instruction for American children."
[time=2494] The future of the nation cannot be trusted to the children unless their education includes their spiritual development.
[time=2501] It is time therefore that we give attention to the religious instruction of the children of America.
[time=2509] I think the day is long past. I'm sorry to say where a text like this could teach the youth of America
[time=2519] right in the context of their own school classroom, the truths that we hold dear.
[time=2528] But I think the men who are quoted here and I think the men who founded this little book for the high schools of Indiana
[time=2534] understood this very important principle that when you are free, like we're free in America, you are free to choose something, choose an objective and then go after it with all your heart.
[time=2544] What is so important is what you choose to pursue.
[time=2549] We are free to pursue an education.
[time=2554] We can go to be a boiler maker or we can be a Hoosier, right?
[time=2559] That's a big choice. You can lose your life over that choice in some families in the state.
[time=2564] That is a free choice and then we can pursue that and we can give ourselves to it and some will do better than others
[time=2572] and that's just what it means to be an American.
[time=2576] We can choose a vocation. We can choose to be a salesman or we can choose to be a teacher or we can choose to be an electrician.
[time=2584] We can choose to be anything really that we want to do that we have the natural aptitudes to pursue and then we get to give our life and we get to go after it and be all we can for it.
[time=2594] It may turn out to be a very profitable and wonderful career or the whole thing may flop and we'll get to choose another one.
[time=2600] That's what it means to be an American.
[time=2603] We get the privilege of choosing where we want to live.
[time=2606] We can live here in Indiana or we can go to Kentucky or we can go down there in Tennessee and talk like some of them folk talk.
[time=2613] You see, we can live anywhere we want to live.
[time=2616] We can get out of this country altogether and live somewhere else.
[time=2619] That's the beauty of freedom. You get to choose and then you get to pursue.
[time=2625] But my friends, when there is not undergirding those choices and those pursuits,
[time=2634] a moral framework, it can lead to absolute disaster in a moral context.
[time=2643] What would happen if our youth could study the Bible again today in their classrooms?
[time=2647] What might they get a hold of?
[time=2649] I'm going to give you three things. I can't teach this whole curriculum.
[time=2652] But I want to just give you three things and ask you, wouldn't this kind of be the idea again?
[time=2657] Number one, when they just cracked the Bible for the very first time and looked at the very first words they would read this.
[time=2664] In the beginning, God, and what a refreshing thought.
[time=2670] In contrast, to way back, there are billions and zillions of years ago there was nothing and then there was time plus chance and something happened.
[time=2678] In other words, the youth of America would begin to remember again and believe deeply in their heart as they studied it in the divine book that they are not the product of time plus chance.
[time=2688] That they are not just circumstances that have collided together in an unusual way.
[time=2695] That there is a creator and that creator has created them in his own image.
[time=2701] And these thousands and millions of high school students all over America would understand they are made in the image of God and that very God has a purpose for their life.
[time=2711] I think our young people need this.
[time=2714] I think our young people are thrown into this sea of relativism where they think the end of life is pleasure.
[time=2723] The end of life is pleasure. Were they to study the Bible, they would find the end of life is to fulfill the purpose that a loving creator has for them.
[time=2738] One of the things that breaks my heart as I see this happening in our country, to realize that in the last 30 years, the suicide rate among teenagers has gone up 300%.
[time=2753] I believe that is directly related to the fact that our young people are not taught from an authoritative source, God Himself, that God exists and that young person is created in the image of God and has a purpose in life to fulfill God's purpose, to fulfill His calling created in His image.
[time=2775] And I wish they could all get it. The second thing that I wish they could get and that they would get as soon as they opened the Bible and all the way through the Bible from the beginning chapters to the end of the chapters is this one simple thought that God designed us to live together in a thing called a family.
[time=2798] That our kids would have the privilege of choosing and pursuing to live in a family.
[time=2807] What do I mean by that? Do you realize that the recent statistics are telling us that 30% of the youth of America are having sex by the time they're 15 years of age following on this first problem of not knowing they're created in the image of God and that He has a purpose for them?
[time=2823] And following into this pleasure seeking reality with all the media of our day, they get swept away into a sea of immorality and they are there exposed to the soul tearing experiences that God never intended for them.
[time=2841] One man, one woman together in love for all of life bearing children and raising a family that holds itself together by its own strength and its own power where there's love and forgiveness and compassion and understanding and all the things a family is supposed to be.
[time=2864] They would read that in God's word, they would say, "My isn't that amazing. You mean it's not just live with whoever you want to live with and maybe never get married and it doesn't matter what's sex and it just kind of all happens and however you feel that day you just kind of go.
[time=2880] You mean there's a way to live together as a family unit and that's where real happiness and real significance is found and security and love and protection.
[time=2893] There's a third thing. There's a third thing I'd give anything for them to know about.
[time=2900] If you know anything about our teenagers, if you know anything about the youth of America, you know that they are hero hungry.
[time=2908] I think we're all pretty disappointed in the heroes. There are a few notable ones.
[time=2913] Captain O'Grady, for one, who just got saved out of Bosnia. But on the whole they end up being very materialistic, very selfish, very self-serving, very empty people.
[time=2925] And their lives begin to fall apart in front of us as they have even in the life of recent heroes, people like O.J. Simpson, who guilty or not, is very disappointing.
[time=2937] If they could begin to open the Bible again, if they could begin to look at what George Washington and all these others mentioned would be the foundation of a strong nation, they could begin to choose, I think, one hero in particular, the hero of the Bible, the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2956] And they could see, in God's Son, the kind of character, and the kind of virtue, and the self-sacrificial act of his own death on the cross.
[time=2968] And they could begin to say, "I want to be like the person of Jesus Christ, who not only died on the cross for my sins, to forgive me for all left on.
[time=2982] It takes residence within me, and gives me power to live the kind of life that brings glory to God, and builds the kinds of families that have made America great."
[time=2995] Well, I love being an American. I think you do too.
[time=2999] I think we often take for granted our freedom. I think we take it for granted every day of our lives.
[time=3003] I wish her a pill I could give all of us, and suddenly we wouldn't take our freedom for granted anymore. And we'd all be even happier than we are today.
[time=3010] I can't imagine what it would be to live where I can't make choices for myself and pursue my goals. I don't know what that would be like.
[time=3016] And I pity the people in the world today who aren't free to choose and pursue.
[time=3021] But we are. We are free to choose and to pursue.
[time=3029] And I think that the real solution for America today, I don't think it's Washington, D.C. I don't think it's legislation.
[time=3037] I think it's a solution that comes one person at a time, one person at a time in this great land.
[time=3045] As we return ourselves back to the foundation of our country, there is a God and He loves me, and He has a purpose for my life.
[time=3055] The most important part of honoring God with my life is building a strong family where people are cared for and loved and nurtured.
[time=3065] And all of that happens for the power and the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3072] I'll tell you what, I don't think we're ever going to see this back in our public school systems or anything like it.
[time=3079] But I want to stand here today and tell you that for 25 years, and for the next 25 years, Black Hawk Baptist Church has been doing one very basic thing.
[time=3090] Teaching the Bible, teaching these truths, standing for these truths, and if you are interested, if you are at all interested,
[time=3102] in revisiting the book, the scriptures, the Word of God, and understanding, and learning, and seeing the difference that they can make first in your own life, and then in our city, and then in our society.
[time=3116] We welcome you back. We welcome you back. As I mentioned next Sunday, I'm going to be starting a series on a teenager, a youth named Joseph,
[time=3128] a very peculiar individual who honored God with his life.
[time=3133] Please don't feel a stranger to come and study together, the true Word of God, the truths that we hold dear.
