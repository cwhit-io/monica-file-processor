[time=57] Now hear that clear. Families fall apart when they stop living for the purposes of God.
[time=65] This is one of the great spiritual laws that governs the spiritual universe.
[time=70] As gravity is true in the natural world, this is true in the spiritual dimension when a family stops living for the purposes of God they begin to fall apart.

[time=285] We'll return to our service in just a moment, but right now, I'd like to tell you about our special gift from the Bible Hour,
[time=292] a lovely digital desk clock with an inspiring picture of two climbers forging up a mountainside
[time=298] and the inscription, together we achieve the extraordinary.
[time=302] This handsome teamwork digital desk clock is our free gift to you when you write to the Bible Hour.
[time=308] Stay tuned, I'll be giving you our address at the end of the program.
[time=312] [MUSIC - 96 seconds]
[time=422] [APPLAUSE]
[time=429] Hi, my name's Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour and thank you again for joining us today.
[time=435] Well, summer's here and we're all, I'm sure, enjoying the little extra freedom, the vacations, the beautiful sunshine, the opportunities to be with family and friends.
[time=444] And as you know, for the last two weeks, I've been away from Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=448] The first week I was gone to California, where I had the privilege and the opportunity of speaking to almost a hundred high school students from the Central California area.
[time=458] They were all coming from secular high schools coming together for a leadership conference and I had the privilege of ministering to them.
[time=465] And even in the process of that, sharing my own testimony and lifting up Christ, so it was an exciting opportunity.
[time=471] And then that next week, we took some time with our family and went to a lake down in Tennessee and just spent some time together in a houseboat and had a tremendous and wonderful time.
[time=482] And I trust and I hope as I just encourage you to think through seizing the opportunity that this summer represents for you and your family.
[time=490] And don't let these days go by, invest your time there and spend that time with them, encouraging them and loving on them and grabbing a hold of all that it represents.
[time=500] And I know God is glorified as we do that.
[time=502] Well, today we begin a brand new study out of the book of Joseph.
[time=506] Actually, the book of Genesis, it's the story of Joseph and he covers thirteen chapters. More is said about Joseph in the book of Genesis than Abraham or Abel or Isaac or Jacob.
[time=518] God really puts the spotlight on this young man's life and of course we pick up the story when he's only seventeen years of age and follow him through all the way to his death at a hundred and ten years of age.
[time=529] And his story is remarkable. It's phenomenal. It's unbelievable to watch the way God so powerfully and wonderfully guides and leads in and through his life.
[time=539] And I think you'll find it a very, very exciting study. I encourage you to be with us over the next seven or eight weeks as we'll draw from his life principles that we can use in our lives to be used as wonderfully by God as was Joseph.
[time=552] And so I encourage you to grab your Bible and be ready as we open the Genesis chapter 37 and have a wonderful time in the study of God's Word.
[time=561] And now we go back to the regular schedule portion of our program.
[time=567] What appears to be a harmless class can turn to romance and homes are defined and feelings that should never have been awakened within.
[time=589] Tearing the heart into this at night bake of you. God your heart. God your heart. Don't trade it for treasure.
[time=606] It's a heart worth talking. God your heart. God's heart. There's a payment for pleasure. It's a heart worth talking.
[time=622] For a soul that we may see. With the conscious cleared. God your heart. The human heart is easily swayed and often betrayed.
[time=644] At the hands of emotion. You did not take the offer to chance. We must choose an advance. We're left with the agony.
[time=660] Such he must try to take. God your heart. God your heart. Don't trade it for treasure.
[time=673] Don't give it away. God your heart. God your heart. There's a payment for pleasure. It's a high price to flee.
[time=690] God your heart. God your heart. Don't trade it for treasure. Don't give it away. God your heart. God your heart. There's a payment for pleasure. It's a high price to flee.
[time=718] For a soul that we may see. With the conscious cleared. God your heart. For a soul that we may see. With the conscious cleared. God your heart.
[time=747] [APPLAUSE]
[time=755] Let me invite you to take your Bibles this morning and come with me to Genesis chapter 37. We're going to begin a study of the life of a man by the name of Joseph.
[time=768] Genesis chapter 37. And frankly, Hollywood really could have fun with the life of Joseph because his life holds the magical thing that seems to sell so many movies today in our day and age.
[time=784] It's the combination of going to the point of absolute adversity where one man stands against the odds where he is lied to and deceived and plotted against and where they try to kill him.
[time=795] And he finally finds himself in an absolutely impossible situation. And then this one guy somehow rises up through all that adversity and saves the day and the movie ends in triumph and we all go home feeling very good about ourselves.
[time=810] In fact, if they were to take the 40 or 50 or 60 or 70 million dollars to do a major motion picture on the life of Joseph, it would likely fall to a guy like Tom Cruise or Harrison Ford to play this whole thing out because that is exactly the kind of bigger than life reality that Joseph actually lived.
[time=830] Then of course, the great distinction with Joseph is he lived that life. It wasn't fantasy. It wasn't somehow somehow made something up.
[time=839] With Joseph, we pick him up in chapter 37 and he's 17 years of age. His but a youth.
[time=844] By the time we are done at the end of the book of Genesis chapter 50, he's 110 years old and he has in fact died.
[time=852] He begins by being greatly loved by his father and equally hated by his brothers.
[time=860] He is by his brothers attempted to be killed and then they settle for selling him off into slavery. And so at this tender age of 17, he finds his way into a foreign land, a land called Egypt where he is not known, he has no rights, he has nothing, he is but a slave.
[time=877] While there in Egypt, minding his own business, he is falsely accused of a crime that he did not commit, found guilty and sent the prison where he has left to die.
[time=888] And as you can tell, a slave and a foreign land, a young boy, no recourse, no hope of legal representation, no way out, it seems as if the end has come to Joseph and that is where the adversity reaches its apex.
[time=902] But by the time the story is over, the true life drama of Joseph, he not only has been vindicated from his prison stay, he not only is freed, he comes out and becomes the second most powerful man in all of Egypt, the prime minister answering only to Pharaoh himself.
[time=922] And as it would be, he happens to be in the most powerful nation of the world, and so it could be said of Joseph that he became the second most powerful man in all the world.
[time=933] A no name, nothing, 17 year old slave boy goes from that to the pinnacle of success and power and achievement, absolutely incredible man and incredible life.
[time=947] That's kind of a thumbnail sketch. We come to chapter 37, and as with any good biographical sketch, there's always a background, there's always a family, there's always a history, there's always a setting out of which this hero arises.
[time=960] And we get a little bit of this in chapter 37.
[time=964] Verse 1, now Jacob, that was Joseph's father. Verse 1 of chapter 37, now Jacob lived in the land where his father had sojourned in the land of Canaan.
[time=977] These are the records of the generations of Jacob.
[time=980] Joseph, when 17 years of age was pastoring the flock with his brothers while he was still a youth, along with the sons of Bill Ha and the sons of Zilfah, his father's wives, and Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father.
[time=998] The bad report, we'll need to look at that and try to understand just exactly what that might be and how bad the report really was.
[time=1006] Joseph had ten older brothers from a total of four mothers. Jacob had four wives, and those four wives had the twelve sons of Israel, or what we know as the twelve tribes of Israel.
[time=1020] The whole story really starts long before Joseph ever shows up and to understand the background, come with me to Genesis chapter 12.
[time=1030] And you'll meet Joseph's great grandfather, a man by the name of Abram.
[time=1037] And Joseph's life is impossible to understand without the context of who Abram was and what God was trying to do through Abram's life.
[time=1049] In chapter 12 verse 1, the Lord came to Abram and said, "Go forth from your country and from your relatives and from your father's house to the land which I will show you.
[time=1058] And I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and so you shall be a blessing.
[time=1066] And I will bless those who bless you and those who curse you, I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[time=1075] At this particular point in history, the earth is populated by literally hundreds, possibly thousands of different people groups.
[time=1084] They had all been one prior to the Tower of Babel, and at the Tower of Babel, God cursed the human race by giving them various languages.
[time=1092] And with those languages, they separated themselves into basic culture groups all around the world.
[time=1098] And as those culture groups grew up, they made their own religious systems.
[time=1102] And so you can see in your mind various nations all around the world, all of them with their own and different polytheism, their various religious devotions to God's, they had created out of their own imaginations.
[time=1114] And not one of these nations was serving the true and living God.
[time=1118] Not one of these nations was worshiping the true Yahweh, the creator of the heavens and the earth, the author of this book, the father of Jesus Christ.
[time=1127] What you had was an entire world on its way to hell, happily and contented in their false religious systems, but the heart of God prevails.
[time=1138] And so God picks Abram, a man living in a land called Err, himself worshiping false gods.
[time=1147] And God intervenes in Abram's life and says basically this, I choose you.
[time=1153] And out of your loins, I will make you a great nation, the nation of Israel.
[time=1159] And what I want to do with the nation of Israel is found in verse 3, look at it again, chapter 12.
[time=1165] And I will bless those who bless you and the one who curses you I will curse, and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed.
[time=1174] God's intention from the beginning for Abram and Isaac his son and Jacob and eventually Joseph and all his brothers, and all who came after them,
[time=1183] was very simply to dispense the knowledge which leads to faith in the true and living God.
[time=1189] Israel from the beginning was a missionary nation.
[time=1192] And he brought them into existence through this Abrahamic covenant so that they could tell all the other nations that there was a true and living God.
[time=1202] You say how were they to do that?
[time=1205] They were to live in obedience to God.
[time=1207] And if they would live in obedience to God, God would bless them circumstantially, give them more cows, and give them more sheep, and give them more corn and barley,
[time=1218] and produce an enormous amount of material blessing that all the other nations would have to look at and say man, they must have the right God.
[time=1228] They got more than we do, they're bigger, they're stronger, they're wealthier, there's more prosperity, and of course all those other nations had made their gods in their own imaginations to try to make them prosperous.
[time=1240] And so by living simply in obedience to the true and living God he would then shower them with blessings, and all the pagan nations would look at the nation of Israel and say my goodness,
[time=1248] they've got the God that really controls the sun and the moon and the stars and the wind and the fertility and animals, the whole nine yards, and they would convert.
[time=1259] They would turn away from their pagan gods, and they would be saved.
[time=1267] Now that is a wonderful thing.
[time=1270] I mean that is the heart of God on display, on a platter, that's all the Bible's about, is God trying to save people.
[time=1275] And he did it in the Old Testament through the nation of Israel, and he's trying to do it in the New Testament through you and me, called the church.
[time=1281] And as you know, everything I've said about the nation of Israel sounds strangely familiar to the Great Commission.
[time=1288] Live in such a peculiar way before the true and living God that the pagans who live around you will look at your life, and in our case the New Testament not circumstantial blessing, but the spiritual blessings of peace and joy and strong families
[time=1304] and the reality of what Christ can do in our lives, they are to look at us and say, man, you got the right God.
[time=1312] What you got I want, what you got I need, and they convert.
[time=1319] That is God's heart.
[time=1321] The problem comes with this very, very horrible tale, is that as each generation went, as it went from the great grandfather to the grandfather Isaac to the father Jacob to the sons of Jacob,
[time=1333] there was an increasing disinterest in the heart of God to save the nations.
[time=1339] They wanted nothing to do with this whole process.
[time=1343] And let me show you that, because you'll never understand the wonder and the miracle and the blessing and the honor and the integrity of Joseph's life until you understand the heartless condition out of which he came.
[time=1357] Abraham knew his purpose.
[time=1358] Look at chapter 12 verse 8.
[time=1360] Abraham knew his purpose.
[time=1362] It says there, then he proceeded from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on the east of I, rather the west of I, I can read.
[time=1374] Bethel on the west and I on the east, there, I did it.
[time=1377] Now the most important part, the last part of that verse, and there he built an altar to the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord.
[time=1384] You say big deal, he built an altar, it is a big deal.
[time=1387] It's a very big deal.
[time=1389] If you were to study the life of Abraham, you would find that over and over and over and over again, he is stopping and building altars.
[time=1395] And what it is, it is symbolic of the way that he would proclaim his love for the true and living God to these pagans who are all around him.
[time=1405] He said, I will not worship with your gods, I will not worship at your altars, I will not be a part of your religious feasts.
[time=1411] My worship is here on my altar, and I make proclamation to Yahweh that he exists, and that I am blessed because of him, and if you don't know, Abraham was remarkably blessed.
[time=1422] Fabulously wealthy, fabulously wealthy, beyond your wildest dreams.
[time=1427] And all the time, making altars proclaiming to those who would look at his wonderfully blessed life, I don't worship Baal, I don't worship the gods of the Canaanites or the Adulomites, I worship Yahweh.
[time=1438] You see, he knew why he was on the planet, and he was excited about it, and he told everybody he knew symbolically through these altars.
[time=1447] Now come with me a little later in the book of Genesis, come to Genesis chapter 34, and see what happens with his great-grandson, these ten sons, the brothers of Joseph.
[time=1460] They have utterly and completely lost the purpose which God had for their life.
[time=1466] Genesis 34, verse 1, "Now Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she had born to Jacob, went out to visit the daughters of the land."
[time=1474] Who is Dinah? Dinah is Joseph's sister, one, actually the daughter of Jacob, okay?
[time=1482] Verse 2, "And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land saw her, he took her, and he lay with her by force."
[time=1491] That's a very nice way to say that he raped her.
[time=1495] Oddly enough, verse 3, "He was deeply attracted to her, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl, and he spoke tenderly to her."
[time=1502] So Shechem spoke to his father, "Hey, more saying, get me this young girl for a wife." Now I don't understand all that. I don't understand how in one minute you commit and act the violent crime against a woman, and then suddenly discover you love her and want to marry her.
[time=1515] But that's exactly what happened.
[time=1517] So now you've got one of these foreigner people, one of these pagans that they're trying or supposed to, at least allegedly, be trying to reach, you've got him wanting to marry one of the daughters, or actually the daughter of Jacob.
[time=1530] What happens? Verse 13, "But Jacob's sons answered Shechem," verse 13, "and his father, Hamor, with deceit, and spoke to them because he had defiled Dinah their sister."
[time=1545] And they said to them, "We cannot do this thing to give you our sister to one who is uncircumcised, for that would be a disgrace to us."
[time=1554] Only on this condition will we consent to you if you will become like us in that every male of you be circumcised.
[time=1562] Now you remember what circumcision was all about?
[time=1565] Circumcision was that very unique and wonderful thing that God gave to the males of Israel, an outward sign of the Abrahamic Covenant.
[time=1575] It was a way for them to have physically marked on their body we exist to tell people that there is a true and living God, and that they can be forgiven through his grace and through his mercy.
[time=1588] That's what circumcision was all about. It was an outward sign of that.
[time=1594] Now apparently this guy who wanted this girl, Dinah, had a lot of influence with his friends.
[time=1599] Because as mature men they all agreed to get circumcised. That's some kind of friendship.
[time=1605] Verse 25, "Now it came about," verse 25, "Now it came about on the third day when they were in pain."
[time=1612] This whole city, this whole region, all this people, they all agree, okay great.
[time=1618] Now obviously it was more than just on to the request of their friend, if they could have circumcision, then they could intermarry, if they could intermarry, they could trade, and if they could trade they could get wealthy, and Israel was wealthy.
[time=1629] So there was a selfish motive in their hearts as well.
[time=1632] On the third day when they were in pain, verse 25, that two of Jacob's sons, Simon and Levi, Dinah's brothers, each took his sword and came upon the city unawares and killed every male.
[time=1645] My lands. You get it? These are the people they were supposed to bring to the true knowledge of God.
[time=1653] These were the people that the circumcision was all about. It was for them.
[time=1658] We were marked by God for you, but at this point they are so debauched and so sinful and so full of revenge that they used the very sign of the covenant circumcision in a plot of treachery and murder and disgrace the name of God.
[time=1673] Absolutely disgraced the name of--what do you think? The rumors were about circumcision in the neighboring nations after this one happened.
[time=1682] Absolutely disgraced the name of God. They have absolutely no sense of their purpose as did Abraham.
[time=1691] Let me show you another point of distinction. Go back to Genesis 24. We'll go back to the life of Abraham again.
[time=1698] And you'll see this remarkable man in a very, very tender moment.
[time=1703] It's time for his son Isaac to take a wife.
[time=1708] And all of us, I think, pray for the ones that our children were married.
[time=1713] We know that it has incredible implications on our children's lives and in our own families.
[time=1717] So I think we're all about that. We understand that.
[time=1720] This wouldn't be peculiar for Abraham to want to take care in the selection of a bride for his son.
[time=1727] But what is unusual is that he not only has that on his heart, but he has this mission that God has given him on his heart.
[time=1734] And he insists that his son's wife be taken from someone other than the Canaanites.
[time=1739] Look at it here in verse 2, chapter 24, verse 2. And Abraham said to his servant, now watch this.
[time=1744] The oldest of his household, who had charge of all that he owned, that's Eliezer.
[time=1748] That's his most trusted and close friend in all the world. He says, now listen here, you place your hand under my thigh.
[time=1756] You're not just going to say yes to this one. You're going to make a solemn oath right by touching right here under my thigh, which was an ancient way of getting as personal as you can get on a very personal thing that I promise you can't break.
[time=1768] What is it? Verse 3, "And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.
[time=1780] But you shall go to my country and to my relatives and take a wife for my son Isaac." Now eventually, obviously, the Israelites were to marry among themselves, but when you're a nation of one, you've got to go somewhere.
[time=1792] And so you go back to your own relatives and you do not allow for that marriage to take place with the Canaanites.
[time=1798] Why? Because if they begin to intermarry with the Canaanites, they lose their distinctiveness as the nation of Israel.
[time=1804] They begin to pollute the line, the messianic line, and they begin to lose their hearts to the gods of those wives that they marry.
[time=1814] And so it was absolutely tenum out and God said, "No marrying among the Canaanites, marry only amongst yourself."
[time=1821] And so you can see here Abraham getting his most trusted friend to do the most important deed.
[time=1829] The line of God must go on untainted.
[time=1834] And we don't have time to go through this beautiful story, but Eliezer did it.
[time=1838] Just as he was instructed, a picture of a perfect servant, humility, and faithfulness.
[time=1844] He executed his duties, he brought this woman back, they were married, and Abraham was satisfied.
[time=1849] Why? Because the plan of God could go on.
[time=1854] Well, come over with me to Genesis 38, and see what happens now with the sons of Jacob, just a few generations later.
[time=1864] You find in chapter 38 verse 1, and it came about at that time, that Judah, that's Joseph's brother,
[time=1871] that Judah departed from his brothers and visited a certain Edulomite whose name was Herah, and Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua, and he took her and went into her, and she conceived and bore a son, and he named Him Ur, and in verse 4 another son, O'Nan, and in verse 5 another son, Shila.
[time=1891] You see that? They don't care anymore. She's beautiful. I'll take her.
[time=1895] I don't care about God's plan. I don't care what God's trying to do.
[time=1898] I don't care that my inner marriage has potential to destroy the whole plan of God to reach an entire world of people.
[time=1903] It doesn't bother me at all. What I want is that woman.
[time=1908] What I want is the gratification of my desires, and so big trouble.
[time=1914] No heart for God. No heart for His program.
[time=1918] Let me show you just one last point of contrast.
[time=1921] Come to Genesis chapter 13. Back to the life of Abraham.
[time=1927] Remarkable, man. The more you know about him, the more you love him, and feel dwarfed by his commitment.
[time=1937] What you found so far about Abraham was one, he knew his purpose, right?
[time=1940] He knew why he was on the planet. He built altars, and he built them, and he built them, and he built them, and he told people all about Christ in our terms, Yahweh in his terms.
[time=1949] Secondly, you sense a sense of separation, or rather obedience to the commands of God.
[time=1953] He would do whatever it took to obey God to keep that line pure.
[time=1957] And what you find here is a commitment to unity.
[time=1961] A commitment to unity. To keep the nation together, because if they are fragmented and fighting amongst themselves, they can have no testimony or witness whatsoever.
[time=1972] Pick it up in verse 5. Genesis 13 verse 5.
[time=1975] Now a lot, that was his nephew. Little young, nobody, lot.
[time=1980] Now a lot who went with Abraham also had flocks and herds and tents.
[time=1985] Now you get it? You want to know why Lot had so much stuff? Because he hung around Abraham.
[time=1989] And there was so much blessing coming out of heaven onto Abraham's life that it kind of splashed over and got Lot.
[time=1995] Lot didn't have a covenant with God. Lot didn't talk with God.
[time=1999] Lot wasn't the one that God chose. Abraham was the patriarch. Abraham was the father.
[time=2004] And Lot just got blessed out of his socks by being near him.
[time=2008] Verse 6. And the land could not sustain them while they were dwelling together.
[time=2012] For their possessions were so great that they were not able to remain together.
[time=2015] In other words, God blessed them so much that their herds couldn't coexist.
[time=2021] Verse 7. And there was strife between the herdsmen of Abraham's livestock and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock.
[time=2028] Now the Canaanite and the parasite were dwelling with them in the land. What's that got to do with anything?
[time=2034] It's got everything to do with everything. You see it? The herds are too big.
[time=2039] So the herdsmen are fighting with each other, trying to be faithful to each guy's master.
[time=2043] And right at the heels of that information comes the end of verse 7.
[time=2046] The Canaanite and the parasite were dwelling in the land. And the whole point is this.
[time=2049] You can't be a witness and a testimony to the true and living God if you're at each other's throats.
[time=2057] Now watch this commitment on Abraham's part.
[time=2061] Then Abraham said to Lot, "Please let there be no strife between you and me,
[time=2068] nor between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers.
[time=2073] Is not the whole land before you? Please separate from me. If to be the left, the left, then I will go to the right.
[time=2080] And if you go to the right, then I'll go to the left." This is remarkable humility, my friends.
[time=2086] Abraham is now deferring to his little nothing nephew Lot
[time=2092] because Abraham is so committed to what God is trying to do to save the world.
[time=2098] And so he says to a man who has no rights whatsoever and whose blessings only come by association with himself.
[time=2105] He says, "Okay, we've got to split up." Not because I don't like you, but we can't have this fighting.
[time=2110] So you want that part or you want that part. I'll take whichever part you don't want.
[time=2115] Remarkable. Remarkable commitment.
[time=2120] Now that puts us in position to appreciate the contents of Genesis 37 in the first chapter of Joseph's Life.
[time=2126] Come with me there.
[time=2133] Four generations later, they hate him and they want to kill him.
[time=2140] You go from the humility and the brokenness and the willingness to be wronged of Abraham
[time=2147] to a fierce firefight of jealousy and hatred and anger that if it would have run its course, would have murdered Joseph, one of those brothers.
[time=2157] You see it there? Verse 2, "Joseph's out there, pasturing the flock with his brothers.
[time=2163] Still a youth, along with the sons of Billhan Zilf. All those are just other ways of saying his brothers." Now, Joseph brings back a bad report about them. Now, who knows what that particular report had to say?
[time=2173] I mean, we already know it could be anything on the spectrum of sin.
[time=2177] We already know they're capable of murder. We know they're capable of incest.
[time=2181] Ruben, his older brother, committed incest with his father's concubine.
[time=2186] So, who knows what they're doing out there in that field? Unconscionable things.
[time=2191] Joseph, apparently, is not a part of them and will not partake in that stuff.
[time=2196] And he comes back and he gives the honest report to his father.
[time=2199] Now, verse 3, "Israel," that's another name for Jacob.
[time=2202] "His father loved Joseph more than all of his sons because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a very colored tunic."
[time=2208] Verse 4, "And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms."
[time=2216] Look at this. This is the covenant of God. This is the family of God that's supposed to be standing up and proclaiming Yahweh.
[time=2224] Now, frankly, I take issue with Jacob here. He had no business making this very colored tunic.
[time=2230] It comes from his own sinful past. If you remember Jacob, "Jacob tricked Esau out of his birthright."
[time=2236] And in this particular culture, if you were the eldest son, you got double portion of inheritance.
[time=2240] You got all the stuff, all the favoritism, all the blessing came down to you, and that was by God's design.
[time=2246] Jacob was not the eldest, and so he tricked his brother Esau out of that blessing, and lied in the process, and eventually deceived his own father, and it caused a huge rift in their family.
[time=2258] And now what you find Jacob doing is handing that same character defect right down to Joseph, or doing everything he can to do it.
[time=2265] He says, "I love you more than them, Joseph. Why? Because you are the one born to me from the one wife I love.
[time=2270] He had four wives, one he loved." And Joseph was the one son at this point in time from the wife he loved.
[time=2276] And so he passes his own character defect right on to Joseph and then puts it on display for the whole world by making this very colored tunic, which was a formal official garment of sorts.
[time=2287] It would have gone all the way to his ankles and to his wrists. No work could be done in it, and it was expensive, and it was just blatant.
[time=2295] Now what is that? I don't get it. It tells me Jacob has also lost the heart for the kingdom of God, or he wouldn't put his sons at odds against each other like this.
[time=2307] And by the way, where was Jacob when Dinah was revenge? You hear nothing from the father after those two sons wipe out that whole land. He does nothing.
[time=2315] You hear nothing in response to the incest that occurred to his own concubine when Ruben had sex with one of his wives. You hear nothing from him.
[time=2322] He was a passive, disinterested, uninvolved, wealthy father who got his special affection set on the one son of the wife he loved and then put it on display for the whole thing.
[time=2337] Well what happened? Verse 5. He's got this very colored tunic and his brothers hate him for it. And then God puts his calling on his life.
[time=2343] Then Joseph had a dream. And when he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more.
[time=2349] He said to them, please listen to this dream which I have had. For behold, we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf rose up and also stood erect and behold your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.
[time=2360] And his brothers got the point. Are you actually in verse 8 going to reign over us? Or are you really going to rule over us so they hated him even more for his dreams and for his words?
[time=2372] Now what I like about the life of Joseph is you can't find any sin anywhere. In Daniel, excuse me, in David's life you can find sin. In Peter's life you can find sin. This is the closest you get with Joseph.
[time=2383] There are two judgment calls here. Should he have worn the very colored tunic? Maybe he shouldn't have worn that. Maybe he should have had the maturity at 17 years of age to see the strife and say thanks dad and stick in the closet and never wear it.
[time=2395] He didn't do that. He apparently wore it. Maybe that was a judgment call.
[time=2398] The second one is telling people about this dream and the one that followed which we won't read but there was another one just like it.
[time=2404] Maybe he should have just got that from God said okay that's what you can do with my life and I'm going to shut up about it and not tell anybody about it.
[time=2410] But you got to realize they didn't have a Bible and when God would communicate with people through dreams there was oftentimes an obligation to tell everybody about it. That was how they learned what God was going to do.
[time=2422] So there may have been a sense in which he was under divine obligation to share this dream even knowingly to his own hurt.
[time=2429] But the wonderful thing about Joseph is that's as bad as it gets. It's all uphill from here. If you can live with a guy that can make those two judgment calls that's it.
[time=2436] That's all you hear about as far as negative in his life. He and Daniel and Jesus are the only major characters in the Bible that never have sin reported about them.
[time=2445] Jesus is the only one never sinned. We just never hear about it with Joseph and Daniel because their lives were so exemplary.
[time=2453] So he gets this dream now look at verse 13. His father Jacob otherwise known here as Israel said to Joseph.
[time=2460] Are not your brothers pasturing the flock in Shechem sound familiar? That's where they murdered that whole group through the circumcision plot.
[time=2469] Come I will send you to them and he said I will go. So here you've got this wealthy passive disinterested Jacob wondering about his money because they've taken his flock into the region where that massacre occurred.
[time=2484] And Joseph says okay I'll go check on it for you. Look at verse 18. When his brothers saw him from a distance and before he came close to them they plotted against him to put him to death.
[time=2495] And they said to one another here comes this dreamer. How then or rather now then come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits and we will say a wild beast devoured him.
[time=2508] Then let us see what will become of his dreams. Man that's vicious stuff. They could hardly wait for him to come and they were just just dying to kill him.
[time=2518] But Ruben now Ruben's the oldest brother the one who committed the incest but still has some responsibility for the family. Ruben heard this and rescued him out of their hands and said let us not take his life.
[time=2529] Ruben further said to them shed no blood throw him into this pit that is in the wilderness but do not lay hands on him and then secretly he was thinking I'll come back and rescue him out of their hands and restore him to his father.
[time=2541] Verse 23. So it came about when Joseph reached his brothers that they stripped Joseph of his tunic the very colored tunic that was on him. Now in my opinion Joseph wear a different coat that day okay.
[time=2551] You know don't go out there and see your brothers after a long time and just be parading that thing but judge McCall.
[time=2557] And they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty without any water in it. Verse 25.
[time=2563] Then they sat down to eat a meal and as they raised their eyes and looked behold the caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead with their camels bearing aromatic gum and balm and myrrh and they were on their way to bring that stuff down to Egypt.
[time=2576] And Judah one of the other brothers said to his brothers what profit is it for us to kill our brother and cover his blood.
[time=2582] Come let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him for he is our brother our own flesh and his brothers listened to them and so that's what they did.
[time=2592] They are literally ripping the line the seed the Abrahamic covenant apart with their own hands and loving it.
[time=2603] Verse 29.
[time=2605] Reuben returned to the pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit so he tore his garments. Reuben apparently wasn't there when they actually made the transaction with the Ishmaelites.
[time=2615] Verse 30 he returned to his brothers and said the boy is not there as for me where am I to go.
[time=2621] What he means is I'm the oldest brother I'm going to get my hand tie my my tan hide for this one hide tan I think I mean to say.
[time=2628] Verse 31.
[time=2629] So they took Joseph's tunic and slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in his blood.
[time=2634] And they sent the very colored tunic and brought it to their father and said we found this please examine it to see whether or not it is your son's tunic.
[time=2643] So he examined it said this is my son's tunic a wild beast has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.
[time=2653] So Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for his son many days.
[time=2658] Then all his sons and all his daughters arose to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and said surely I will go down to Sheol in mourning for my son.
[time=2667] He doesn't mean by that hell but he means by that death Sheol was an Old Testament term for the blackness of death and so his father wept for him.
[time=2676] Now listen that's some that's some crime.
[time=2679] The crime was bad enough to have the hard heart to do that to your brother.
[time=2683] It's another thing to come back to your father and lie to him about what you have done and then mock some level of comfort in the man's pain.
[time=2693] And my guess is this and you can't prove this my guess is this that those ten brothers hated their father so much for his passive role in that family
[time=2704] and all that he wasn't that he was supposed to be and the favoritism that he showed upon Joseph that they were secretly delighting in his pain.
[time=2712] They could hardly wait to see the grief on his face when he learned that his favorite son was dead.
[time=2718] I don't know. Seems possible. I'll tell you one thing they held that secret all their lives.
[time=2724] They held that secret all their lives until Joseph broke it.
[time=2729] There was never any remorse. The kind of remorse that would bring them back to their father and say please forgive us.
[time=2736] Verse 36. Meanwhile, meanwhile while all that's going on you know you kind of cut away to the other scene.
[time=2743] Meanwhile, the Midianites sold the seventeen year old Joseph into Egypt to a pot of fur who was Pharaoh's officer the captain of the bodyguard.
[time=2755] And that's where the story really gets good. But you got to come back next week for that part of it.
[time=2761] Let me give you three words of application as we close. Get these now. These could help you.
[time=2769] Write out of this narrative. Write out of these men's lives.
[time=2773] Three thoughts. Three words of application. The first is a word of instruction.
[time=2777] The first is a word of instruction. Here it comes.
[time=2780] Families fall apart when they stop living for the purposes of God.
[time=2795] This is one of the great spiritual laws that governs the spiritual universe.
[time=2800] As gravity is true in the natural world, this is true in the spiritual dimension when a family stops living for the purposes of God they begin to fall apart.
[time=2812] Your family is no different than Abrams. That's wonderful.
[time=2817] Your family is my family is no different than Abraham's family. You and I have the call of God upon our lives.
[time=2824] For him it was Genesis 12, 1 to 3. For you and me it's Matthew 28. It's called the Great Commission.
[time=2830] You and I have a family so that we can advance the gospel to the people around us who do not know Jesus Christ.
[time=2838] And when you and I disenfranchise ourselves from that one simple purpose our families begin to fall apart.
[time=2848] Abraham did it with altars. He saw himself as a stranger and an alien in a foreign land.
[time=2854] And that is exactly the terminology that the New Testament uses to describe us.
[time=2858] We are strangers and aliens in a foreign land and the call of God is upon your family and my family
[time=2866] to live in a peculiar way so that we can tell other people about the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=2873] Your family is not about getting your kids raised and educated and married to Christian kids.
[time=2879] That's part of what your family is but that is not the call of God on your family.
[time=2884] That is not the sum total of what God intends for you to be on this planet to do.
[time=2889] As it was with Abraham so it is with you it is to proclaim the knowledge and dispense the knowledge which leads to faith.
[time=2895] What happens when you lose that purpose?
[time=2898] What happens when a family stops living for the purpose of God?
[time=2903] It starts living for itself.
[time=2906] And the cancer of selfishness begins to eat its way into that family.
[time=2911] And it spreads sometimes slowly at the beginning, sometimes under the surface and you can't really see it and eventually it blossoms and consumes the very life of that family.
[time=2921] When you are not living for the purposes of God you are living for your own purposes and as noble as they may be, as moral as they may be when they are not the purposes of God they are then your own
[time=2931] and that selfishness will corrupt and destroy.
[time=2934] And then will come the rivalry and then will come the arguments and then will come the anger and then will come the hatred.
[time=2944] Make no mistake about it.
[time=2947] Families fall apart. Families begin the process of decay as soon as they stop living for the purposes of God.
[time=2955] The one overarching purpose that subordinates everybody in the family to everybody else is that we are not on this planet for each other.
[time=2963] We are on this planet for the unsaved.
[time=2966] And there comes the mutual submission and the mutual sacrifice to the glory and the honor of Christ.
[time=2973] And when you take that out of your family dynamic you begin the slow descent to demise.
[time=2979] It may take four generations, but you are on your way.
[time=2983] Now, this word is still under the first word of instruction.
[time=2986] I have to talk to you dads for just a minute because this is all about the patriarchs.
[time=2990] This is all about Abraham and his son Isaac and his son Jacob and his son Joseph.
[time=2995] Dads, here it is. I want to ask you a question. Are you leading your family?
[time=3001] Are you leading your family into an ever deepening sense of service and purpose for the great commission?
[time=3008] There's the question.
[time=3011] Then ask you how big your bank account was, how nice your yard looks, how well you provide for the kids' education, how great the vacation went, how often you're home, how much time you spend with them.
[time=3021] I didn't ask any of those questions.
[time=3022] Are you leading your family into an ever deepening sense of service and purpose for the great commission?
[time=3030] Is that your agenda? Is that the big question you want to be evaluated at at the end of your life?
[time=3036] And they recount the effort and they recount your experience and they say you know what?
[time=3041] He led us. He led us in the purpose of God to reach the unsaved.
[time=3051] Second word, a word of warning. Second word of application is a word of warning and it's this.
[time=3057] Listen, these brothers were successful in their deceit, right? They pulled it off to a tee and they held their deceit for years, for decades, and their dad never knew until finally Joseph broke the news.
[time=3068] They were totally successful and Jacob didn't lay awake at night saying, "Gee whiz, I don't really believe my sons.
[time=3075] I really think Joseph's alive somewhere. I think they plotted. I think they deceit." That never crosses the page of Holy Rit. He was completely duped by their deception. They were totally successful.
[time=3086] But listen to this, Proverbs 28-13, "He who conceals his transgression will not prosper.
[time=3094] He who conceals his transgression will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will find compassion."
[time=3102] Do you want to know something about those brothers? All ten of them?
[time=3105] They carried the guilt of that act all the rest of their life and when later they found their way into Egypt and they were just about ready to be destroyed,
[time=3114] they said openly, "God is punishing us for what we did to Joseph."
[time=3120] That means that every single time they had a negative experience, a trial, a hardship, something went wrong,
[time=3127] their minds had to carry the guilt associated with that past action and they were wondering, "Is this it?
[time=3132] Is God finally going to have his way with me in discipline for that act?" They did not have a clear conscience and I bet it ruined every day of their life.
[time=3142] I don't know what you're struggling with this morning.
[time=3145] I don't know what you think you've successfully concealed.
[time=3149] What sinful behavior you think you've duped and successfully the people around you.
[time=3154] But you know and God knows it is yet unconfessed and it is yet unrepented of.
[time=3159] And every negative thing that comes into your life, your mind goes right back to that event.
[time=3164] Man, wouldn't it be great to wake up tomorrow morning with a clear conscience?
[time=3169] And the weight is gone because you have what?
[time=3172] You have confessed and forsaken your sin and you have found compassion.
[time=3179] For those of you who are here this morning, who are hiding and thinking you're successfully coping with a sin
[time=3186] because nobody knows about it, let me tell you something, learn from these 10 men.
[time=3191] It haunted them every day of their life as it does you.
[time=3196] Now a word of hope and we're done.
[time=3200] A word of hope, a word of encouragement. Listen to this.
[time=3203] These were some sinful men, right?
[time=3205] I mean they were as about as low as you could get, incest, murder, lying, deceit, treachery,
[time=3211] selling your own brother, full of jealousy and anger.
[time=3216] They were playing fast and loose with God.
[time=3219] They were the covenant people and they were playing fast and loose not only with their own lives but the purposes of God in their lives.
[time=3226] And they were at the rock bottom of spiritual junk.
[time=3232] But here's the great news, God isn't done with them yet.
[time=3237] You see that the botchery of their life in Genesis 37, and you got to understand something, God is working even as He sells Joseph into the Egyptian slavery.
[time=3248] He is working for the betterment and for the repentance and for the restoration of those 10 brothers who did it out of anger and jealousy.
[time=3255] He is taking their very sinful act and He will over time turn it around into the one of the greatest blessings they ever receive.
[time=3265] Here's the truth, God never gives up on His children.
[time=3270] God never ever gives up on His children.
[time=3273] Philippians 1-6 says, "I am confident of this very thing.
[time=3276] That He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ." That includes the days when you are sinful and rebellious and your heart is turned against God and you feel spiritually ugly and disgraced and sinful and you're a failure and you've committed spiritual treason and you're angry with God in your worst state as were these brothers in Genesis 37.
[time=3297] God is still on your side.
[time=3301] God still loves you and He is working on your behalf.
[time=3308] So I don't know what you're hurting with today.
[time=3311] I don't know how far away you feel from God, but I want to stand here as His messenger and tell you He hasn't quit on you.
[time=3318] He loves you as much today as He did the day you accepted Christ as your Savior
[time=3324] and He is as committed to your spiritual growth and prosperity today as He was then.
[time=3329] He is unconditional.
[time=3332] Trust Him for that.
[time=3334] Would you stand with me for a closing word of prayer?
[time=3338] ♪
[time=3346] Well, I don't know how that message strikes you today.
[time=3350] Maybe you recognize beyond a shadow of a doubt that the problems in your life are the result of not being aligned with the purposes of God for you and for His plan for your life.
[time=3362] And you can see how your life is kind of disintegrating and losing every day the sense of quality and meaning and purpose that you so much wish it would have.
[time=3372] Let me tell you, you can't find meaning and significance, real meaning and lasting significance and the stuff that fills your heart with joy outside of living for the glory of God, of having Christ as your personal Savior and then serving God and allowing His agenda for your life to take place.
[time=3392] I can tell you that if you will give your life to God, you will find His purpose and His meaning flooding your life.
[time=3399] It's an absolutely incredible experience.
[time=3401] I can also ask you today, as we just think back on that message, do you have a clear conscience?
[time=3408] Or are you carrying around day after day after day that sense of guilt and maybe anger at people and bitterness?
[time=3416] It'll eat you up, eat you alive.
[time=3418] You weren't designed to carry that kind of stuff.
[time=3421] And in the person of Jesus Christ, you can have that guilt lifted and you can have that anger removed and by His power, He'll help you work through those situations.
[time=3430] Can't promise that all those relationships go back together and they're perfect and there are no more problems with them, but He can help you through them and give you purpose and meaning through those.
[time=3440] You know, there is great hope, even as we saw God working in the lives and on behalf of those 10 brothers who were plotting to murder their own brother, Joseph.
[time=3450] God never quit on them. God never gave up on them. God still loved them.
[time=3454] God was still working for their good.
[time=3457] And that's been true of you every single day of your life.
[time=3460] God has never quit on you. He's never given up. He's never turned His back.
[time=3464] He's never once meant evil for you.
[time=3468] God, in fact, has provided Jesus Christ, His own Son, who died on the cross for your sins to be your Savior, to give you forgiveness and to give you purpose and meaning.
[time=3479] But you've got to accept it. You've got to come to the place where you turn your life over to God, where you commit your life and your eternity to the person of Jesus Christ, where you accept that great gift.
[time=3491] You can do that right now. You can bow your head right now with me.
[time=3495] I'll pray out loud. You pray in your heart and you can pray to receive Christ as your Savior and have a whole new start and a whole new beginning.
[time=3502] It'll change your life. I invite you to do it now.
[time=3505] Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3508] I know that my life has not had your purposes, and I know I have a guilty conscience.
[time=3514] And I know I need the hope, the hope that can come only in Christ.
[time=3519] And so I accept Jesus Christ into my heart to be my Savior and my Lord this day.
[time=3525] And I commit my life to live for you, for your purpose, for your glory.
[time=3530] I pray these things in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3533] Well, if you just prayed and made that decision and accepted Christ as your personal Lord and Savior,
[time=3540] I'd love to know about it.
[time=3542] Write me here at the Bible hour and let me know about the decision you have made.
