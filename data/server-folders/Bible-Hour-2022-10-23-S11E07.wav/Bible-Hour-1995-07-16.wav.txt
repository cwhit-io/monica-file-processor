[time=899] - Man, we're blessed.
[time=904] Thank you, you too, for being such wonderful people and for using your gifts to help our church.
[time=910] Come with me to Genesis, Genesis chapter 39.
[time=914] If you missed last week, you might not know.
[time=915] We're in a study of the life of Joseph.
[time=919] We began last week in Genesis 37.
[time=921] We'll skip 38 because it's not about Joseph and we come to Genesis 39.
[time=928] It says at the beginning of that chapter that Joseph had been taken down to Egypt and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.
[time=942] By the hatred of his own brothers, he was first desired to be murdered but then they settled on selling him to these Ishmaelites.
[time=947] They wanted him out of their lives.
[time=949] And he was taken down to Egypt and came into the ownership of a man by the name of Potiphar.
[time=954] You see it there, captain of the bodyguard.
[time=957] He might be comparable to the head of the FBI.
[time=960] In our day and age, he was also the chief executioner.
[time=964] He was the guy in charge of killing people in Egypt.
[time=967] What we learned in Genesis 39, in fact, this message is entitled resisting temptation because Joseph, as you know from our last study, is about 17 years of age.
[time=980] We have no time indicator here in 39.
[time=982] It may have been a year, it may have been five, it may have been 10 years since he was last with his family in the land of Canaan.
[time=989] But he is, at this particular point in his life, going to face one of the greatest tests that any man can face.
[time=995] And certainly one of the greatest sexual temptations that you or I could possibly imagine.
[time=1002] And he is going to face this and he is going to succeed.
[time=1005] And so this morning, we'll try to learn from his experience.
[time=1007] The Bible is candid with the failures of its characters.
[time=1011] We see the adultery of David.
[time=1013] We see the selfishness of Solomon.
[time=1015] We see problems all throughout scripture.
[time=1018] The word of God doesn't hide the real human factor from us.
[time=1022] But refreshingly, in Genesis 39, we see success.
[time=1026] Spiritual victory.
[time=1028] And as I say, we'll do our best to understand it and model it.
[time=1032] Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a great theologian of the previous century and he has a little booklet that he's written about 50 pages in length about temptation.
[time=1042] And out of it comes a great excerpt that really explains and exposes the dynamics of temptation inside of a person.
[time=1050] He writes or writes this way.
[time=1052] In our members, there is a slumbering inclination toward desire which is both sudden and fierce.
[time=1058] With irresistible power, desire seizes mastery over the flesh.
[time=1063] All at once a secret smoldering fire is kindled.
[time=1067] The flesh burns and is in flames.
[time=1069] It makes no difference whether it is sexual desire or ambition or vanity or desire for revenge or love or fame and power or greed for money.
[time=1077] Joy in God is extinguished.
[time=1080] And we seek all our joy in the creature.
[time=1083] At this moment, God is quite unreal to us.
[time=1087] Satan does not here fill us with hatred of God but with forgetfulness of God.
[time=1092] Lust aroused envelops the mind and will in deepest darkness.
[time=1097] The powers of clear discrimination and decision are taken from us.
[time=1101] It is here that everything within me rises up against the word of God.
[time=1106] If you've been following the news at all, you know that a man by the name of Hugh Grant who is an up and coming movie star in Hollywood about ready to have a major motion picture break on the scene just next week.
[time=1119] 34 years old, the absolute heartthrob of millions of women all around the world happens to have a gorgeous supermodel type girlfriend.
[time=1130] He was arrested.
[time=1132] Arrested just last week on the streets of Los Angeles, Sunset Boulevard, a rather seedy part of the city.
[time=1138] He was in his BMW in the front seat, it was parked and he was having sex with a prostitute.
[time=1142] And even the secular writers couldn't figure it out.
[time=1147] What was he thinking?
[time=1149] Was the flavor of many of the articles that I read?
[time=1152] What was he doing?
[time=1153] I mean, a prostitute on the street of Los Angeles, just past midnight, this guy who could have any number of women who himself has a gorgeous girlfriend, I mean, he's on the brink of his career just exploding.
[time=1167] What was he thinking?
[time=1169] Bonhoeffer answered it nearly 100 years ago.
[time=1173] Lust aroused envelops the mind and will in deepest darkness.
[time=1178] The powers of clear discrimination and decision are taken from us.
[time=1187] It is in that moment that we stop thinking and we start following the lust that has overcome us.
[time=1194] And it would be easy for us to look at Hugh Grant and point a finger and say, see there he is, a pagan and unredeemed, enveloped in his own lust, potentially risking AIDS, potentially throwing his career away.
[time=1207] See, there he is.
[time=1209] But we know ourselves too well, don't we?
[time=1212] We have to get up every morning and look in the mirror and say, oh yeah, there he is.
[time=1217] There's the one, there's the man, there's the woman who can be caught in his or her own lust, maybe not lust for a prostitute, but lust for some unforbidden thing.
[time=1228] And when we get enticed and when we let it have its way with us, we lose the powers of clear discrimination.
[time=1237] And our mind and our will is enveloped in darkness and we sin and we fail and we succumb to the temptation.
[time=1245] But on this day, Joseph stood strong.
[time=1252] And it is a remarkable thing that Joseph did because the setting in which this temptation comes is astounding.
[time=1261] And we're gonna kind of give you five factors that made Joseph vulnerable to temptation here and hopefully learn from that before we go on to examine how he resisted the temptation.
[time=1270] But you understand, every circumstance, every temptation comes in a set of circumstances.
[time=1275] And Satan never tempts us in a vacuum.
[time=1278] Satan has described the New Testament as the roaring lion that is seeking someone to devour.
[time=1284] He is on the prowl.
[time=1286] And if you know anything about how a lion hunts from having watched some of the nature shows on television, you know that a lion is in waiting and he is watching and he is constantly positioning himself until his prey is in its most vulnerable position and then he strikes, then he pounces.
[time=1303] Because out there in the wilds of Africa or wherever they are, they can't risk expending that level of energy without a prey in return for their effort.
[time=1315] And so they wait and they watch and they position and then at the right moment they pounce.
[time=1321] And that is like Satan.
[time=1322] Satan will watch your life.
[time=1326] Satan will watch the circumstances of your life and he will watch and he will wait and then he will pounce when you are most vulnerable.
[time=1333] And Joseph couldn't be any more vulnerable than he is right here.
[time=1339] Let's look at it.
[time=1340] Five factors that made Joseph vulnerable.
[time=1342] Number one, look at verse one again, chapter 39.
[time=1347] Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt.
[time=1350] Stop right there.
[time=1351] Joseph was vulnerable because he was alone.
[time=1356] He was alone.
[time=1358] He was all by himself living in a foreign land.
[time=1362] He had not the support of his family and friends.
[time=1364] Do you understand nobody knew who he was?
[time=1366] Nobody knew what he stood for.
[time=1368] Nobody knew what he believed.
[time=1370] Nobody knew about his great grandfather Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and Yahweh and the Abrahamic covenant and all of that stuff.
[time=1377] He was isolated, he was alone.
[time=1379] And he had absolutely no support from the people around him.
[time=1383] Nor did he have any support from the, what I call the routine of religion.
[time=1387] They must have had there in Canaan.
[time=1389] They must, we know they had sacrifices.
[time=1391] They must have had some way of reminding themselves that they were the children of God and that they were on a mission and as dimly as that little light was now flickering in their nation, there would have at least been some of the routine of religion.
[time=1405] And it was all gone from him now.
[time=1407] He was in a pagan society.
[time=1409] It was against everything he would have stood for.
[time=1413] Very, very vulnerable.
[time=1417] Many of us, those surrounded by Christians, put ourselves in almost identical condition.
[time=1424] You're isolated and alone in the midst of a sea of Christians because you won't talk to anybody about what's really going on in your life.
[time=1431] And many Christians have the tendency to keep everybody at arm's length.
[time=1438] And so yeah, I've got 15 Christian friends.
[time=1441] I got 25 Christian friends.
[time=1443] But I don't have one Christian friend who really knows where I'm vulnerable, who really knows where I hurt, who really knows how I'm tempted.
[time=1448] And so in that sense, we too can be alone without ever leaving the homeland.
[time=1453] But first of all, he was alone.
[time=1457] Secondly, Joseph was enjoying unchecked success.
[time=1461] Unchecked success.
[time=1464] Look at verse two, it says there.
[time=1466] The Lord was with Joseph.
[time=1468] So he became a successful man.
[time=1471] I found that very interesting.
[time=1472] It didn't say he did a project well and was a success at the project.
[time=1477] It doesn't say he had a few good years and he was very productive.
[time=1481] It characterizes him as a successful man.
[time=1485] There's more insight in verse three.
[time=1487] It says that all that he did prospered in his hand.
[time=1491] The Lord caused all that he did to prospe, that means it doesn't say some things, it doesn't say most things, it doesn't say usually, it doesn't say on the whole, it says all.
[time=1501] Everything the guy touched turned to gold.
[time=1506] Man, that's kind of, that's kind of heady stuff.
[time=1511] Look at verse five, he got the credit for it and it came about that from the time he made him oversee her in the house and overall that he owned the Lord blessed the Egyptians house on account of Joseph.
[time=1524] And the Lord's blessing was upon all that he owned in the house and in the field, see?
[time=1530] But what I found intriguing there was it, it says there, verse five, it came about that from the time he made him oversee her.
[time=1537] It's not as if Joseph stepped into a great tidal wave of momentum that was already flowing in Potiphar's house and all Joseph had to do was not getting its way and just kind of channel it a little bit.
[time=1547] I mean, it was from the time that Joseph came, it's when he came, that's when the blessing started.
[time=1552] We were just a normal household until Joseph came when Joseph came, man, look at what's happened.
[time=1556] So there's no question in anybody's mind that Joseph was responsible, at least from a human perspective for all this blessing.
[time=1564] You know, success has a way of breeding independence.
[time=1569] When you become successful and you kind of reach your goals and you kind of are the one and you're kind of are the one that can't seem to do anything wrong, there is a very sinful pride that breeds an independence that could make a person very vulnerable to sin.
[time=1584] The third one we find in verse four.
[time=1594] You'll find that Joseph not only was incredibly successful that he, but that he was free.
[time=1599] He had freedom and power and autonomy to direct his own day, his own schedule, much of his life.
[time=1605] Says in verse four, so Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant.
[time=1610] And he made him overseer over his house and all that he owned he put in his charge.
[time=1616] Verse five, made him overseer in his house over all that he owned.
[time=1623] Verse six, so he left everything he owned in Joseph's charge and with him there did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate.
[time=1633] That's amazing.
[time=1634] Remember now, this is a slave boy.
[time=1636] Over time, he gained so much respect and so much credibility that Potiphar doesn't know what he's doing on a day-to-day basis, doesn't know where he is any given hour, doesn't have a time clock, doesn't check up on him.
[time=1649] In other words, he was free of the concerns of his entire house, he just wondered what he was gonna have for his next meal.
[time=1654] Who knows where Joseph is, he's doing something and whatever he does always turns to gold so let him do whatever he's doing.
[time=1660] Total freedom and power and autonomy and that can make people very, very vulnerable because that person has the power and the autonomy to orchestrate circumstances so that they can fulfill their own lust and their own gratification.
[time=1675] In other words, Joseph wasn't pure for lack of opportunity.
[time=1681] Joseph wasn't pure because he couldn't have it any other way because he couldn't escape from the ever-present eye of his master that kept him busy from sun-up to sundown and then he was too exhausted to do anything else.
[time=1692] Joseph had a multitude of opportunities in which he could have sinned.
[time=1695] Tremendous freedom and power and autonomy.
[time=1700] The fourth one you'll find in verse six, this is a doozy, look at the end of the verse.
[time=1704] Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance.
[time=1709] He was a great-looking guy, form and appearance.
[time=1712] The phrase only appears three times in the Bible.
[time=1714] Once it refers to David, another time to David's son, Absalom, and then here to Joseph.
[time=1720] So only three of the guys out there got the title, handsome in form and appearance.
[time=1726] And form and appearance means both the facial was handsome or whatever that means.
[time=1730] If it was a woman, it was beautiful.
[time=1731] And then appearance, the body was perfect.
[time=1736] So you've got an absolute 10, if you will, on your hands here.
[time=1740] Great-looking guy, great body, great face, great everything.
[time=1744] Caught the eye of the ladies, the heartthrob.
[time=1749] The seeing was the one in.
[time=1750] The fifth is in verse seven.
[time=1754] And it came about after these events that his master's wife looked with desire at Joseph and said, lie with me.
[time=1763] The man was under direct and repeated solicitation.
[time=1766] Direct and repeated solicitation.
[time=1770] Look at verse 10.
[time=1771] And it came about as she spoke to Joseph day after day that he did not listen to her to lie with her beside her or be with her.
[time=1777] Verse 11, now it happened one day that he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the household was there inside.
[time=1785] That would just exemplify the sense of being alone.
[time=1788] I mean, not only was he alone in terms of family and religion, he was now alone with her, somehow in that house, and nobody was around.
[time=1794] Verse 12, she caught him by his garment saying lie with me.
[time=1799] Direct solicitation.
[time=1801] What an unbelievable set of circumstances.
[time=1804] He's alone having been rejected and hated by his brothers.
[time=1807] He's successful, which breeds a sense of prideful independence.
[time=1811] He's got all the freedom and all the power and all the opportunity in the world to do whatever he wants to do, including have illicit affairs.
[time=1818] He's incredibly good-looking so much so that women see him and want him, and he is under the direct and repeated solicitation of the woman of the house, who would have been in position to understand all that he'd accomplished and give him a sense of how wonderfully truly was.
[time=1834] My lands, unbelievable.
[time=1838] But the great news is folks, he comes through this thing with shining colors and dispels forever the question.
[time=1848] I mean, by his saying no, he says forever that you and I, too, can say no.
[time=1852] I mean, if he can do this, we can do this.
[time=1854] If a man can make it through this, we can make it through this.
[time=1857] But let's look at how.
[time=1860] Let's look at how, how did he do it?
[time=1861] What's this technique?
[time=1863] I mean, what's the secret?
[time=1864] I mean, what was he thinking?
[time=1866] How did he do this and not fall to this great temptation?
[time=1871] I'll give you four principles of resisting temptation.
[time=1875] Four principles from the life of Joseph on resisting temptation.
[time=1878] Number one, he fought the temptation with the truth.
[time=1886] What do I mean by that?
[time=1887] She was offering him romance.
[time=1890] Her package was wrapped in romance and excitement and passion.
[time=1896] She was offering him a quick fling.
[time=1900] But Joseph saw past her offer and the falsehood of her offer and sin is always a lie.
[time=1906] And he saw the truth about it.
[time=1908] And in verse nine said what you're really offering me is a great evil and it's a sin against God.
[time=1914] And that is the beginning of winning against temptation.
[time=1916] You have got to see past the thin, veneer, the lie, the deception, that there is a passing pleasure and get to the reality of what it is.
[time=1924] It is a great evil and it is a sin against God.
[time=1927] You don't need to come here, but in Proverbs chapter seven, a wise man is speaking to a young son about avoiding the ensnarement of the adulterous.
[time=1937] And though this isn't all explained in the episode with Joseph, you get the impression these are the dynamics.
[time=1944] She comes out to meet this young boy in Proverbs seven, this young man, she says this, I have come out to meet you, to seek your presence earnestly and I have found you.
[time=1956] Man, that's powerful stuff.
[time=1959] I don't want sex, I want you, she says.
[time=1964] And then she says, I have spread my couch with coverings, with colored linens of Egypt, I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon.
[time=1972] She's man, I not only want you, I want you so bad that I have made special and wonderful provisions for our time of intimacy alone.
[time=1981] And then here's her offer, come.
[time=1986] Let us drink our fill of love until morning, let us delight ourselves with caresses.
[time=1991] Do you see what she's offering?
[time=1993] She is offering to be filled with something.
[time=1996] Satisfaction, come with me and be truly satisfied to the core of your being.
[time=2002] And it will be a satisfaction built of love and it will last until morning and we will delight ourselves in it.
[time=2008] And all of that is a lie, all of that is a lie.
[time=2012] They will not be filled.
[time=2014] They will not be a fulfillment of love.
[time=2016] It will not last until morning and it will not be delightful.
[time=2018] For the moment that act is conceived or culminated, they will both be overwhelmed with a sense of sin and guilt and shame and the emptiness of what they have done.
[time=2027] But she sweetens the offer even more by saying there will be no consequences.
[time=2033] Not only can we do all this stuff, we'll never get caught, for the man is not at home.
[time=2037] He has gone on a long journey.
[time=2039] He has taken a bag of money with him at full noon he will come home.
[time=2043] In other words, we're safe inside my chamber.
[time=2045] I've thought of every possible contingency.
[time=2048] Come, please come.
[time=2052] But the Word of God looks past the facade of that sin and then says this.
[time=2058] With her many persuasions, she entices him with her flattering lips and she seduces him.
[time=2064] Her flattering lips, she didn't mean anything, she said.
[time=2067] She didn't come for you to meet you, to seek you, to have found you.
[time=2072] She came for herself, her own gratification and the thrill of that moment.
[time=2078] And this poor person who lingers with this temptation, it goes on to say suddenly he follows her as an ox goes to slaughter.
[time=2087] Or as one in fetters to the discipline of a fool.
[time=2090] In other words, he thinks he's going for a time of great fulfillment, of great love, of great delight.
[time=2096] And what he is actually doing is he is acting like the ox who goes to his own slaughter.
[time=2101] Goes on to say until an arrow pierces through his liver as a bird hastens to the snare, so he does not know that it will cost him his life.
[time=2109] But Joseph knew.
[time=2111] You see, that's the point.
[time=2113] Joseph knew the truth.
[time=2115] And he looked at her and all her, I would imagine, all her beauty.
[time=2120] And he looked at her in that perfect moment of absolute secrecy except for the eyes of God.
[time=2126] And he said, you know what, you're offering me?
[time=2130] It really isn't at all what you're saying it is.
[time=2132] What you're really offering me is a great evil and a sin against my God.
[time=2137] The second thing we learned from Joseph
[time=2144] about how to resist temptation is that Joseph chose not to just obey a moral code of God, but was beating in the heart of Joseph wasn't simply God said, I can't do that, so I won't do that.
[time=2160] Now, that's part of obedience.
[time=2162] And if that were all their word, that would be enough.
[time=2166] Because God is who he is.
[time=2168] But Joseph understood the law of God and the true meaning behind the law of God and found strength to resist.
[time=2175] Look at it.
[time=2176] It says in verse eight, he refused.
[time=2179] And he said to his master's wife, behold, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house.
[time=2184] And he's put all that he owns in my charge.
[time=2187] There is no one greater than I in this house.
[time=2189] He has withheld nothing from me except you because you're his wife.
[time=2193] What's he saying?
[time=2194] Look it, I'm not gonna do this with you because I have a relationship with this guy named Potiphar.
[time=2199] And through the years of our working together, he has grown to trust me and respect me and have confidence in me.
[time=2206] And if you think I'm gonna sell my relational integrity for a quick moment with you and bed, you're crazy.
[time=2212] I know about God.
[time=2215] And God said that his law, that his design is for men and women to relate in healthy, productive ways and the happiest ways to do that are within the boundaries of his order.
[time=2227] Joseph knew that he could in no way give up his relational integrity with this man for the passing pleasure of sin.
[time=2236] You see, it's not a code to him.
[time=2239] It's not an empty little law that sits kind of limp in the law of God.
[time=2246] He understands God.
[time=2247] He understands that God wants him as happy and as joyful and as fulfilled as he can possibly be.
[time=2252] And that happens when you honor the relationships in your life.
[time=2255] He chose relational integrity.
[time=2258] You can see that same thought, not just with Potiphar
[time=2264] but with God.
[time=2265] Verse nine, there's no one greater in this house than I and he has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife.
[time=2272] In other words, of all the people who ought to have relational integrity, it ought to be you.
[time=2276] You married to him, you know him and love him and are connected to him in a way that I never will be.
[time=2280] But then he adds the second dimension at the end of verse nine, how then could I do this great evil and sin against God?
[time=2286] God was as real to him as Potiphar, maybe more real.
[time=2290] His relationship with God meant everything to him and he was not about to sacrifice the integrity of his relationship with God for this passing pleasure with her.
[time=2300] Joseph, I believe had cultivated the presence of God in his life.
[time=2304] I believe he walked every minute of every day knowing that God existed.
[time=2307] And as you'll see, God communicated with him already in chapter 37 through these dreams.
[time=2311] I mean, he was in touch with God and he loved God and he knew that God loved him and they walked together through the days of life and this woman was not gonna get in the way of his relationship with God.
[time=2322] It's a totally different perspective, isn't it?
[time=2325] So oftentimes we think of obedience and God is this great cosmic killjoy up there saying, oh, that'd be fun.
[time=2330] You can't do that.
[time=2331] That'd be fun, you can't do that.
[time=2332] Joseph valued his relationship with God in the purity of it and said, no way.
[time=2339] You are not worth me compromising my relationship with God even for a minute.
[time=2345] Don't see obedience as some empty moral code
[time=2351] given by a distant removed God.
[time=2354] Understand that when God asks you and commands you to be sexually pure, it is because he has your best interest at heart and it is in that context that you can develop meaningful relationships with each other and with God.
[time=2369] Everything else is a sham.
[time=2370] Number three, number three.
[time=2377] Principal number three is this, Joseph took drastic measures to stay pure and so might you need to do the same.
[time=2386] Sometimes you can't stay pure and just kinda go with the flow.
[time=2390] Sometimes you gotta stand up and make a decision and take a course that extricates you from the temptation itself and there may be a price associated with that.
[time=2398] But that's what he was willing to do.
[time=2402] Remember there in verse 11, she's after him day after day.
[time=2406] That's after he already said I won't do it in verse nine but she wouldn't quit.
[time=2410] He's forced to kinda stay in that environment.
[time=2411] That's his job, that's his responsibility and she no doubt manipulates the situation where she can try to entice him over and over again day after day.
[time=2420] He refuses to listen to her.
[time=2421] He doesn't even acknowledge her.
[time=2423] It's doing nothing to him.
[time=2425] But in verse 11, maybe she sent all those servants out of the house.
[time=2428] Maybe it was just chance.
[time=2430] But they're there together, they're alone.
[time=2432] I mean, he's doing his work.
[time=2434] That's what it says, he went into the house to do his work unlike David who stayed away from the battlefield and should've been out there doing his work.
[time=2440] Joseph was going in to do his work and nobody was there inside.
[time=2443] In verse 12, she catches him by the garment saying lie with me.
[time=2447] Now she's gotta hold of him.
[time=2448] And the drastic measure there in verse 12, he left his garment in her hand and fled and went outside.
[time=2455] Whenever the Bible lingers long on how to avoid sensual temptation, there is always a common theme in the council and it is to run and to flee to get away from the temptation because if you reason with sensual temptation, you will eventually lose.
[time=2471] If you reason or bargain with sensual temptation, you will eventually be overcome and like the boy in Proverbs 7, who approximates the ox being led to slaughter in a sudden way.
[time=2483] He loses his powers of discernment.
[time=2485] Do not reason with it.
[time=2489] You'll notice that Joseph didn't claim a verse.
[time=2493] You'll notice that Joseph didn't lead her to the Lord or try to.
[time=2496] He didn't reason with her.
[time=2497] He just turned around and he ran out of that house.
[time=2500] Some of you may be in need of turning and running from situations which nearly bring you to compromise.
[time=2510] But instead you're lingering, you're reasoning, you're thinking, principle number four.
[time=2519] He refused to give up.
[time=2523] It is a matter of endurance, my friends, because to resist once is not enough.
[time=2529] The world system and Satan himself will bring that back over and over and over again.
[time=2536] He said no to her in verse nine, how can I do this great evil and sin against God?
[time=2540] What does she do?
[time=2541] She brings it right back in his face day after day after day and eventually grabs a hold of him and he fights her off one last final time.
[time=2550] You do not win in the battle for purity by having a small temporary victory.
[time=2557] Once is not enough, especially in our culture and in our day.
[time=2561] It will come back around over and over again.
[time=2563] It may be a different person.
[time=2564] It may be the different place, but it will come back.
[time=2567] And you must assume that you're in this thing for the long haul.
[time=2571] I'm in Hebrews 12 where it talks about the Lord and his ability to stay faithful.
[time=2577] It says for consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself so that you may not grow weary and lose heart.
[time=2583] Part of being a successful Christian is standing strong over a long period of time in the face of temptation.
[time=2589] It says there you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood and you're striving against sin.
[time=2594] In other words, stay faithful all to the way that you would die rather than sin.
[time=2599] Never give in, never give up.
[time=2601] It's an endurance race.
[time=2604] You can count on that stuff coming back around.
[time=2608] Well, it's a wonderful thing isn't it?
[time=2612] Joseph was successful.
[time=2613] He maintained his purity, his relationship with pothifer, his relationship with God and his own relational integrity.
[time=2622] And you think about now boy, I bet God sends in the ministering angels.
[time=2626] I'll bet he rubs on him a little bit spiritually, builds him up, gives him a pep talk, saying Joseph, you are incredible.
[time=2632] Great job, buddy.
[time=2634] I'm proud of you.
[time=2635] Here, here's a new blessing.
[time=2636] Here's a new sphere of influence.
[time=2639] No, look at verse 13.
[time=2641] When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled outside, she called to the men of her household and said to them, see he, meaning the husband, has brought in a Hebrew to us to make sport of us.
[time=2654] He came in to me to lie with me and I screamed and it came about when he heard that I raised my voice and screamed that he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside.
[time=2662] So she left his garment beside her and tell his master came home, then she spoke to him with these words, the Hebrew slave whom you brought to us came in to me to make sport of me.
[time=2672] And it happened as I raised my voice and screamed that he left his garment beside me and fled outside.
[time=2677] Now it came about when his master heard the words of his wife, which he spoke to him, saying this is what your slave did to me that his anger burned.
[time=2687] William Congreve says this, heaven has no rage like love to hatred, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.
[time=2697] I think when she screamed there, it wasn't a scream of protection obviously from the advances of Joseph.
[time=2704] It was more likely a scream of outrage and bitterness and unbelievable dismay that she could have gone this far and become that vulnerable and put herself out there that to that extreme and he just ran away from her.
[time=2717] It's probably a scream of rage and fury.
[time=2720] And being the clever woman that she was having the garment and the circumstances added it up to frame him for attempted rape.
[time=2728] Look what happens in verse 20.
[time=2732] So Joseph's master took him and put him into the jail, which is surprising.
[time=2737] I mean, as the chief executioner for something like this, he'd think he'd have been dead before he'd known what hit him.
[time=2742] But Potiphar may not have believed his wife.
[time=2744] Potiphar may have known the character and quality of his wife and couldn't do nothing but certainly wouldn't take it to the extreme.
[time=2750] So he took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king's prisoners were confined and he was there in the jail.
[time=2760] What a lonely closing statement.
[time=2762] And he was there in the jail.
[time=2764] He goes from a pit just outside of Shechem down into Egypt, enjoys some success.
[time=2771] And to no fault of his own is now falsely accused and thrown and left alone and forgotten in jail.
[time=2776] Man, that's a funny response, isn't it, from God?
[time=2782] You'd think it would have been different.
[time=2783] But God knew what he was doing and had a wonderful plan for the whole thing.
[time=2788] And you'll see how that works out as we continue our study next week.
[time=2791] Let me give you three words of application this morning, just as we close.
[time=2797] Just three words like we did last time, a word of instruction, a word of warning, and a word of hope.
[time=2802] A word of instruction, a word of warning, and a word of hope.
[time=2805] The first, this word of instruction, I trust that you will make every effort to be aware of your circumstances.
[time=2815] There are some circumstances where you are not as vulnerable as others.
[time=2820] There are times in your life when you are more vulnerable and it may not be because of success, it may be because of failure.
[time=2827] It may not be because everything you touch turns to gold, it may be because some things you really wanted to see happen in your life obviously aren't, and you're never gonna reach that vista and show you're discouraged and you're down and you're alone and you're vulnerable.
[time=2840] It may not be because you're handsome and form and appearance, it may be because you are the opposite of that.
[time=2844] And when somebody finally does show you some attention, you're so thirsty for it that you'll take it even though you know it's wrong.
[time=2849] You gotta know yourself.
[time=2853] You gotta know your circumstances.
[time=2854] You gotta know when you're weak and you've got to be in the process of building hedges of protection into your life.
[time=2860] I want you to know that I stand here before you in no way counting on my own ability to do what he did in the worst of circumstances.
[time=2870] I don't trust myself like that.
[time=2871] I have hedges all around my life.
[time=2874] Certain places I will not go, certain things I will not do, certain people I will not hire, certain people in my life who know my weaknesses and watch me very carefully to see if I am even brushing clothes to a compromising situation.
[time=2887] I'm not counting on me.
[time=2888] In the moment of temptation, I'm counting on my heart for God when I'm sane and clothed and in my right mind saying, "Good night, help me." And I build hedges around my life so I don't ever get as close to this stuff as he did.
[time=2900] Know yourself.
[time=2903] Be very, very careful.
[time=2905] Watch your circumstances and be sure that you have built hedges of protection into your life.
[time=2914] Well, how about a word of warning?
[time=2915] I want to speak for a minute to those of you who are in our midst today who are on the fence of sexual immorality and in a crowd our sizes bound to be at least one.
[time=2926] And suddenly somewhere in this message, it stopped being a message and it started being God talking to you.
[time=2934] And everything I've said seems to have just come funneled right down into your heart.
[time=2937] Let me tell you what that is.
[time=2938] That's the spirit of God working with you this morning to try to protect you from doing something stupid.
[time=2943] You're out there and you haven't done it yet,
[time=2949] but you know that you are on a path that if it continues in this direction, it will be irresistible.
[time=2956] And you know who that special person is or you know that special situation and you're orchestrating events and you're saying things and you're giving hints and things are heating up.
[time=2965] And I just want to say one thing to you, run.
[time=2972] Turn your back this morning in this.
[time=2975] Don't make this decision later.
[time=2976] Do it right now.
[time=2978] Covenant with God and then tell a friend your situation and run as fast as you can because the damage that you will do to your life is nowhere worth what you're about to do.
[time=2989] Giving away your relational integrity is one of the most painful things a person can do.
[time=2996] And hurting the people around you.
[time=2998] You have no idea what you'll do to them.
[time=3001] Your wife, your husband, your kid, your parents, the rest of us.
[time=3005] It's an exacting, expensive price.
[time=3010] And while you are here and while the Spirit of God is talking to you, run away.
[time=3016] Do whatever you have to do.
[time=3020] If that means changing jobs, if that means changing cities, if that means changing states, do it.
[time=3028] Please do it.
[time=3032] Now let me give you a word of hope.
[time=3034] And this word goes out to those of you who have already done it.
[time=3038] This word goes out to those of you who have already compromised yourself, who have already given in, who have already sacrificed.
[time=3047] Maybe you're in the midst of an affair right now or maybe it's in your past, but it may as well be in the present because you feel so ugly before God and you feel so alienated before God and you think that you've pushed the thing so far away that he could never forgive you again.
[time=3061] Let me tell you what, that is Satan at his best.
[time=3064] First, he was successful in pouncing on you and now he wants to keep you down and if he can keep you thinking that you're ugly before God and that he can't forgive you and that you can't be restored and your life can never be of meaning again because of this dirty ugly thing you've done then he wins on both counts.
[time=3081] On behalf of God, I want to stand here this morning and say this, lamentations three, the Lord's loving kindnesses indeed never cease.
[time=3091] Did you hear that?
[time=3095] The loving kindnesses, it's a plural, who knows why?
[time=3098] He doesn't just have one kind of loving kindness.
[time=3100] He's got multiple loving kindnesses and here's the point they never cease, that means no matter what you've done, no matter how far you've run, they never cease.
[time=3109] The verse goes on.
[time=3110] For his compassion's never fail, compassion.
[time=3115] He has never not moved with compassion for your situation.
[time=3119] He never reaches the point of no return with you.
[time=3123] He never says, good night, I am sick of this.
[time=3125] You have done something so horrible, you're outta here.
[time=3128] Never, never crosses his mind.
[time=3131] It's just always a new level of deep bowel compassion for you and your herd and your pain and your sorrow and your sin and the mess you've made of your life.
[time=3141] He stands as ready to greet you and forgive you and restore you in relationship with him as the day you first met him.
[time=3147] Says then, they are new every morning,
[time=3153] great as thy faithfulness.
[time=3154] You know, we think of the faithfulness of God and we think of it in terms of the fact that there's a sunrise and he keeps the earth doing its thing and we don't fall out of space and our bodies continue to work and we have food and we have, you know, the faithfulness of God and he's been true to keep his promises.
[time=3168] But that's not how, I mean, that big song, we sing, great is thy faithfulness.
[time=3171] It's right outta here.
[time=3172] Why? Because his loving kindnesses never, ever, ever cease.
[time=3177] He's always ready to forgive and to restore.
[time=3183] Trust him for that, will you please?
[time=3187] Come back to him.
[time=3188] Let me close with this story from a book by Max Lucado.
[time=3193] No wonder they call him a savior.
[time=3195] The small house was simple but adequate.
[time=3201] It consisted of one large room on a dusty street.
[time=3205] Its red tile roof was one of many in this poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the Brazilian village.
[time=3211] It was a comfortable home.
[time=3213] Maria and her daughter, Christina, had done what they could do to add color to the gray walls and warmth to the hard dirt floor.
[time=3220] An old calendar, a faded photograph of a relative, a wooden crucifix.
[time=3225] The furnishings were modest, a pallet on either side of the room, a wash, basin, and a wood burning stove.
[time=3231] This is where they lived.
[time=3233] Maria's husband had died when Christina was an infant.
[time=3238] The young mother stubbornly refusing opportunities to remarry got a job and set out to raise her young daughter, Christina.
[time=3244] By now, 15 years later, the worst years were over.
[time=3248] Though Maria's salary as a maid offered few luxuries, it was reliable and it did provide food and clothing.
[time=3254] And now Christina was old enough to get a job and offer some help.
[time=3259] Some said Christina got her independence from her mother.
[time=3262] She recoiled at the traditional idea of marrying young and raising a family.
[time=3266] Not that she couldn't have had her pick of husbands, her olive skin and brown eyes kept a steady stream of prospects at her door.
[time=3273] She had an infectious way of throwing her head back and filling the room with laughter.
[time=3278] She spoke often of going to the city.
[time=3280] She dreamed of trading her dusty neighborhood for exciting avenues in the city life.
[time=3284] Just the thought of that horrified her mother Maria, who was always quick to remind Christina of the harshness of the streets.
[time=3291] People don't know you out there.
[time=3293] Jobs are scarce, life is cruel.
[time=3295] Besides, if you went there, what would you do for a living?
[time=3297] Maria knew exactly what Christina would do or would have to do for a living.
[time=3302] That's why her heart broke.
[time=3305] That's why she couldn't believe it one morning when she awoke to find her daughter's bed empty.
[time=3310] Maria knew immediately where her daughter had gone.
[time=3312] She also knew immediately what she must do to find her.
[time=3315] She quickly threw some clothes in a bag, gathered up all of her money and ran out of the house.
[time=3320] On her way to the bus stop, she entered a drug store and got one last thing, pictures.
[time=3325] She sat in a photograph booth, closed the curtains and spent all the time she could on pictures of herself.
[time=3331] With her purse full of small black and white photos, she boarded the next bus to Rio de Janeiro.
[time=3337] Maria knew her daughter had no way of earning money.
[time=3340] She also knew her daughter was too proud to give up.
[time=3344] And when pride meets hunger, the human being will do things that were before unthinkable.
[time=3349] Knowing this, Maria began her search.
[time=3353] Bars, hotels, nightclubs, any place with a reputation for street walkers or prostitutes.
[time=3359] She went to them all and each place, she left them her picture taped to a bathroom mirror, tacked to a hotel bulletin board, fastened to a corner telephone booth and on the back of each photo, she wrote a note.
[time=3372] It wasn't long before the photos and the money ran out
[time=3378] and Maria had to go home.
[time=3379] A few weeks later, young Christina descended the hotel stairs, her young face was tired, her brown eyes no longer danced with youth, but spoke of pain and fear, her laughter was broken, her dreams had become a nightmare.
[time=3395] A thousand times over, she had long to trade those countless beds for a secure pallet back home.
[time=3401] Yet the little village was in too many ways, too far away.
[time=3405] As she reached the bottom of the stairs, her eyes noticed a familiar face.
[time=3410] She looked again and there on a lobby mirror was a small picture of her mother.
[time=3415] Christina's eyes burned and her throat tightened as she walked across the room and removed the small photo.
[time=3421] Written on the back was a compelling invitation.
[time=3426] Whatever you have done, whatever you have become, it doesn't matter.
[time=3434] Please come home.
[time=3436] Whatever you have done, whatever you have become, it doesn't matter.
[time=3444] Please come home and she did.
[time=3448] You realize that God has put his picture
[time=3454] all over creation and all throughout the Word of God.
[time=3459] Every page you'll find a picture of God and it's always the same thing at the bottom.
[time=3464] Whatever you have done, whatever you have become, it doesn't matter.
[time=3469] Come home.
[time=3474] Let me invite you now to stand for just a closing Word of prayer as we dismiss.
