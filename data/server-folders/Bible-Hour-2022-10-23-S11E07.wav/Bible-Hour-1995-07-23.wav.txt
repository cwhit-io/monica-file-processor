[time=0] God was going to make a fine piece of jewelry out of the life of Joseph.
[time=12] In fact, he was going to make him prime minister of all of Egypt, the second most powerful man in the world.
[time=17] And he would there have more power than he knew what to do with.
[time=20] He would carry the Pharaoh's ring.
[time=22] He would drive the Pharaoh's chariot.
[time=24] He would have total freedom and complete autonomy to do anything he wanted in the land of Egypt.
[time=30] That's some fine piece of work that God had in mind.
[time=33] But before he sat about to do it, he would first test and try this man, Joseph.
[time=45] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=49] Thanks for joining us.
[time=51] What in the world is God doing with my life?
[time=54] Most of us have asked that question from time to time, if not out loud, at least quietly to ourselves.
[time=60] Today as we continue our study of Joseph's life, we find him falsely accused of rape,
[time=66] thrown in jail, and forgotten by his friends.
[time=69] In this adversity, Joseph's godly response holds many valuable lessons about responding to God even when we're confused about what he is doing with our life.
[time=79] Stay tuned as Pastor Moore looks again at the life of Joseph.
[time=84] Now let's join our service.
[time=114] [MUSIC - 244 seconds]
[time=366] [APPLAUSE]
[time=370] We'll return to our service in just a moment, but right now I'd like to tell you about our special
[time=376] gift from the Bible Hour, a lovely digital desk clock with an inspiring picture of two climbers forging up a mountain side, and the inscription "Together, We Achieve the Extra Ordinary".
[time=388] This handsome teamwork digital desk clock is our free gift to you when you write to the Bible Hour.
[time=394] Stay tuned, I'll be giving you our address at the end of the program.
[time=398] [MUSIC]
[time=415] The signs are obvious, they are everywhere.
[time=422] All that we hear about is the glumendous bear.
[time=428] So many would be prophets saying it's the end of it all, but my earth can take much more.
[time=438] The hammer's got to fall.
[time=442] That nature has its needs, that's a nice summer.
[time=448] But it appears to me that our greater concerns, because we can save the planet, thinking of a sun-passing light.
[time=462] But Father Ty is calling us to save somebody's life.
[time=470] So I won't bend and I won't break, and I won't water down my faith.
[time=477] I won't come for much, but we're at a desperation.
[time=484] Where as back and I cannot change, before tomorrow and today, I must feel like the future generations.
[time=503] If we could find a way to preserve our faith.
[time=509] So those who follow us, see the price that was made.
[time=515] They may be when they question what it's going to take to survive.
[time=522] They'll find the strength to carry on, and we'll really be high.
[time=530] I won't bend and I won't break, and I won't water down my faith.
[time=537] I won't come for much, but we're at a desperation.
[time=544] Where as back and I cannot change, before tomorrow and today, I must feel like the future generations.
[time=558] Looking in the eyes of the children, knowing that tomorrow is at stake.
[time=567] When the choice is up to them, will they have the strength to say?
[time=575] We won't bend and we won't break, and we won't water down our faith.
[time=582] We won't come for much, but we're at a reputation.
[time=589] Where as back and I cannot change, before tomorrow and today, I must feel like the future generations.
[time=603] We must feel like the future generations.
[time=630] The future generations.
[time=638] Well, if you've been a Christian for long at all, you've recognized that life can bring some unpleasant surprises.
[time=651] I mean, there's no question that life can produce some things that we didn't expect, didn't want, didn't anticipate, wouldn't have chosen.
[time=659] And I'm amazed at how we as believers almost feel like that's out of bounds.
[time=665] Like, in some way, God is breaking His promises to us by allowing these negative things to come into our lives.
[time=672] I know I can think that way myself.
[time=674] It's a very subtle little dynamic that goes on in the Christian life where we somehow believe that if we're obedient and if we're praying and if we're spending time in His Word that He is somehow obligated,
[time=688] to lift us up out of any trouble, kind of let us skip as it were across the mountaintops of life and never have to experience the valleys.
[time=698] Well, here's one thing we can't count on.
[time=701] God is going to keep His promises to us.
[time=703] We just have to kind of rethink and remind ourselves, well, what are the promises that God has made to us?
[time=709] You'd be interested to know, nowhere in the New Testament does God promise a problem-free life.
[time=715] What He does promise is Christ's likeness.
[time=718] The theme that He will continually move us into the person of Christ to have the character of Christ, the attitudes of Christ, the direction of Christ, the responses of Christ, to be like Christ.
[time=730] That's His promise.
[time=732] We also find as we study the New Testament that one of the ways, in fact a major way, that He produces that character in us and continues to conform us to the person of Christ.
[time=743] It would be through trials and through hardship and through suffering and through persecution and things that we wouldn't choose for ourselves.
[time=751] And so, I guess when we see those things, instead of thinking my lands, God is breaking His promise to me, it should be the opposite.
[time=758] Here's God keeping His promise to me, to move me, to be more like Christ.
[time=763] Well, stay with us today.
[time=764] We're going to look at how this works in the life of Joseph, and I hope you're encouraged through it.
[time=773] Jesus is the sweetest name I know, and He's just the same as His lovely name.
[time=798] And that's the reason why I love Him so.
[time=811] What Jesus is the sweetest name I know.
[time=825] Jesus, Jesus, He means all the world to me.
[time=853] Jesus, Jesus, without Him where would I be?
[time=873] He's like the crude drink of the water on a hot summer's day.
[time=885] A light in the darkness that drives fear away.
[time=893] He's a pillow for a weary brat, a shale deeper of the clouds.
[time=904] Jesus is all of these, and more to my soul.
[time=917] Jesus, Jesus, there's just something above that name.
[time=939] Jesus, like the fragrance after the rain.
[time=959] Jesus, Jesus, oh Jesus.
[time=968] Let all heaven and earth proclaim.
[time=979] Kings and kingdoms will all pass away.
[time=993] But there's something above that name.
[time=1017] Thank you, Steve and Maria.
[time=1028] Beautiful message this morning.
[time=1030] Let me invite you this morning to come to Genesis chapter 39 as we continue our study in the life of Joseph.
[time=1037] And what I said while my mic wasn't on was thank you, Steve and Maria, for that beautiful message this morning.
[time=1044] We're in our third message on the life of Joseph, and if you're just with us this morning, I trust that you'll be able to kind of get the gist of what we're doing and this study and be benefited by it this morning.
[time=1055] But we left off last time with Joseph in chapter 39 verse 20.
[time=1061] You find that Joseph master took him and put him into the jail, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in the jail.
[time=1070] Kind of just a stark lonely way of stating the condition he was there in the jail.
[time=1076] And I don't know about you, but if I'm Joseph, I'm coming to that point in my life about right now where I start asking a question, what in the world is God doing with my life?
[time=1087] What in the world is God doing with my life?
[time=1091] Joseph is by this time about 25 years of age, can't be certain, but he's somewhere in his mid 20s.
[time=1097] God, as you know, had promised him through two separate dreams that he would eventually have preeminence over his family.
[time=1103] They would bow down, they would worship him, he would lead them, he would be in charge of them.
[time=1108] But to this point in his life, there is nothing to indicate that God has any intentions of keeping his word, that God would actually be true to his word in his life.
[time=1118] He was innocently the object of his father's inordinate affection and favoritism.
[time=1123] He was then hated, despised, and rejected by his brothers as they mercilessly sold him to total strangers into a life of slavery.
[time=1133] Totally alone in a faraway land, he was forced to learn a foreign language and lifestyle, a new way to eat, a new way to dress, new people to associate with.
[time=1143] By God's grace, he won the favor, trust, and respect of his new master, only then to be thrown into a dungeon and left to die, as his master refused to look past the obviously trumped up charges of attempted rape.
[time=1158] Once in the dungeon, according to Psalm 105, he was "afflicted." They afflicted his feet with fetters, and he himself was laid in irons.
[time=1168] What in the world is God doing with his life?
[time=1173] Well, the answer comes if you hold your place in Genesis 39 and come with me to Psalm 105.
[time=1179] It will only be there a minute, so don't lose your place in Genesis.
[time=1183] Psalm 105 is a marvelous review of Israel's history.
[time=1191] And it touches and covers an enormous span of time, but in covering this great period of Israel's history, it does touch on Joseph's life.
[time=1198] And you can find it in Psalm 105, verse 17.
[time=1204] He sent a man before them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
[time=1209] They afflicted his feet with fetters. He himself was laid in irons, verse 19.
[time=1214] Until the time that his word came to pass, the word of the Lord tested him.
[time=1221] The king sent and released him the ruler of peoples and set him free.
[time=1226] He made him a Lord of his house and ruler over all his possessions.
[time=1232] What in the world was God doing with Joseph, verse 19?
[time=1235] Until that time, or until the time that his word came to pass, the word of the Lord tested him.
[time=1242] And then you'll notice, verse 20, the king sent and released him.
[time=1246] So I take it, everything that we know up to Joseph's life to the point that the king sent and released him, which begins in the next chapter, chapter 41, as we go back to Genesis,
[time=1254] was nothing more than one great testing by the Lord.
[time=1260] I looked that word up in the Hebrew, tested.
[time=1263] It's seeroth, or seeroth.
[time=1266] And it can be translated goldsmith, or silversmith. It can also be translated to refine, to try, and to purge.
[time=1273] It described the process. The word was used to describe the work of the goldsmith as he would refine the gold prior to making a fine piece of jewelry out of it.
[time=1285] Proverbs 25, 4 says, "Take away the dross from the silver, and there comes out a vessel for the smith."
[time=1292] That's the process, described by being tested or tried.
[time=1296] You see, God as the jeweler here, God as the goldsmith, God as the silversmith, was about to make a marvelous piece of jewelry out of Joseph and his life.
[time=1307] A splendid work, an awesome work, an extravagant work, as God intended to lift Joseph up to be the second most powerful man in the world.
[time=1317] The prime minister of Egypt, and in that lofty position he would have unbelievable power.
[time=1323] He would wear the ring, the very ring of Pharaoh. He would drive his chariot. He would have total authority and autonomy and freedom to do whatever he wanted to do.
[time=1333] That's a marvelous piece of work that God is about to do, and before he does it, he is going to make sure that the material he works with is pure and undefiled, and that man's name is Joseph.
[time=1344] Now that, even in a secular sense, prime minister of Egypt, but you and I know behind the scenes in the spiritual dimension, God is using Joseph, this one solitary man with a heart after God to protect, to preserve, and provide for the nation of Israel, which was itself God's evangelistic measure
[time=1362] for all the nations of the world. And so his accomplishments in the spiritual demand, far out shadow, what he did in a secular realm, just being number two in the nation.
[time=1371] I mean, Joseph is going to be a remarkable work of God. Maybe the best that God has done to this time in history, and he says, "I've got to make sure that the raw material of the man himself is purified and refined and undefiled and unmixed gold, because I'll not waste my work on anything less."
[time=1391] So he spends these early years of his life refining his character, giving him opportunity to understand people and to understand God.
[time=1401] And the text we come to this morning now back in Genesis 39 and chapter 40, both of these chapters, are really the cumulative effect of God's refining fire as it reaches its culmination.
[time=1414] At the end of verse 20 there, he was there in the jail. That really is the lowest point that we know of in Joseph's life.
[time=1422] And all that has gone before this is apart and it culminates now in the refining testing process of God. And so we can learn from Joseph.
[time=1430] He is now in jail and I want to just look at his jail experience and draw three very simple but true lessons about how we ought to be responding to the refiner's fire in our life.
[time=1442] It may be that you're here today and the circumstances of your life are not what you had hoped or envisioned.
[time=1449] And you are asking the question, "What in the world is God doing with my life?"
[time=1456] You can't believe that he allowed you to be sexually abused when you were a child and that those memories and that the pain of those events and the mistrust that it built into you for humanity at large still plague you day after day after day.
[time=1469] You can't believe that God allowed you to live in a situation where your husband or your spouse has committed adultery and you now know of it and you live in the aftermath of that.
[time=1478] There's no way out of it. You can forgive and you can try to restore but the reality stands.
[time=1486] You had no idea God was going to lead your life in this particular direction.
[time=1490] Some of you possibly still single, wondering when in the world God is finally going to come through and you've done everything you can do and you've lived as obediently as you know how and yet still he withholds from you the thing you wanted most.
[time=1504] Some of you may have lost a child to cancer or a spouse or wished you could have had a child. Life has its ways.
[time=1513] And you sit here today saying, "What in the world is God doing with my life?"
[time=1520] Well I can't answer that question. But I can't answer how you should respond to it.
[time=1527] I can't answer the question at least from Joseph's life. How does God want me to respond even in the midst of the confusion to what he is doing in my life?
[time=1539] Well the first very basic principle comes out of the end of chapter 39 verses 21 to 23.
[time=1548] But the Lord was with Joseph and extended kindness to him and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer.
[time=1556] And the chief jailer committed to Joseph's charge all the prisoners who were in the jail so that whatever was done there he was responsible for it.
[time=1565] The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Joseph's charge because the Lord was with him and whatever he did the Lord made him to prosper.
[time=1574] That's really all the Bible records for us in terms of the relationship that was going on between Joseph and his Lord.
[time=1582] And what I find conspicuously absent, I find myself asking where is the anger?
[time=1589] Where is the grumbling? Where is the bitterness? Where is the desire for revenge? Where is the wanting to go home?
[time=1597] How come none of that seems to exist in the life of Joseph? And if it did it was very shortly dealt with because by implication the blessing of the Lord here in 21, 22, and 23 have to mean that Joseph was standing right before his God and he was submitting to whatever the sovereign plan of God was for his life.
[time=1617] Joseph could have said, "You know this father's favoritism thing wasn't my fault. My dad had a problem with that. He deceived his own father with that. And then he pushed it onto my life. I didn't want it. I didn't ask for it. I didn't like it.
[time=1628] It led to my brothers hating me, wanting to murder me, and eventually selling me to total strangers. I didn't ask or deserve that either.
[time=1635] And then I get down there. I fight my way into the culture. I learn the language. I serve the man. I am above the approach.
[time=1642] I resist the advances of his wife and now I'm in jail and I'm in fetters and I'm in prison and I'm in irons and I don't like this and this is my fault and I'm sick of this whole thing."
[time=1651] Where is all that? You don't find it in his life. It's not there.
[time=1657] Somehow or another, and this is the first principle, Joseph has continued to trust God.
[time=1663] He could have been saying, "God, you promised that I was going to be in charge, that I was going to lead my family in some way. Now my family doesn't even know I exist.
[time=1671] I'm rotting away in some Egyptian dungeon."
[time=1677] And all the circumstantial evidence was against Joseph and his ability to trust God, but somehow he trusted God.
[time=1685] And I hope you don't underestimate this.
[time=1688] You can think with me for a moment about the life of Job.
[time=1692] And you remember that Job, when that book opens, was described as a righteous man.
[time=1697] Which doesn't mean he never sinned, it means he was very godly in his character and his relationship with God and the way he conducted the affairs of his life.
[time=1705] But God allowed the circumstances of his life to fall apart, lost his kids, lost his wealth, lost his reputation, lost a lot of things and became physically ill, had boils from head to toe.
[time=1716] And at first, Job's response was wonderful, but the longer Job was left in that condition, the more apt he was to question the character of God.
[time=1726] And to question whether or not God was trustworthy, and to begin to say in a very adamant and repetitive way, in my words, God, what in the world are you doing with my life?
[time=1736] Listen to it in the words of Job, he says, "I loathe my own life, and I will give full vent to my complaint.
[time=1745] I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. I will say to God, do not condemn me. Let me know why thou does contend with me.
[time=1753] Is it right for thee indeed to oppress, to reject the labor of thy hands, and to look favorably on the schemes of the wicked?"
[time=1760] Now friends, that is nothing short of an indictment of the character and the wisdom and the plan of God.
[time=1766] In other words, what do you think you're doing, God, condemning me and looking favorably on the schemes of the wicked?
[time=1773] You don't say things like that to God.
[time=1775] I mean, God is never the object of those kind of comments. He goes on later, he says, "Oh, that I knew where I might find him."
[time=1784] Job is saying, "If I can only find God, the heavens have become like cast iron to him, and none of his prayers were getting through, and God's presence was taken from him in the experiential sense."
[time=1794] And so you find Job saying, "Oh, that I might know where I could find him." Why? That I could come worship him?
[time=1801] Say, "I trust you." Say, "I love you." Say, "You're good, even though my circumstances are bad." Say, "I know you have a plant." No.
[time=1807] That I might come to his seat, and I would present my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
[time=1814] I would learn the words which he would answer and perceive what he would say to me.
[time=1818] In other words, when we get into this dialogue, I mean, I'd learn what his arguments are.
[time=1822] Then would he contend with me by the greatness of his power? No. Surely he would pay attention to me.
[time=1829] There the upright would reason with him, and I would be delivered forever from my judge.
[time=1834] If I could just get into an argument with God, he'd make his case, I'd make mine, he wouldn't use his power, because he would be so convinced that I was right that he was wrong that I would be delivered.
[time=1844] I don't know if you've ever been through a hard time in your life.
[time=1850] I don't know if you've ever had the circumstances really go sour, but I imagine if you have, you could identify a little bit there with your hope.
[time=1860] You don't stop coming to church, you don't take away your membership, you don't throw your Bible away and burn it.
[time=1865] You keep up with the religious externals, but inside your heart there's a Christian fatalism that builds and gains momentum,
[time=1871] and you question the goodness of God, and you question the value of prayer, and you wonder why even live obediently,
[time=1877] because if this is what is produced by those kinds of behaviors, I may as well just live however I want to live.
[time=1882] And a distance begins to grow between you and your God.
[time=1887] Listen, that is very common, that is very common in Christian experience.
[time=1893] Even Job, a righteous man, went through it.
[time=1896] And of course, we know at the end that Job repented and said, "I have no business ever to question you, and I do trust you, and I do love you, and please forgive me for my attitude."
[time=1906] Joseph teaches us that when we are in the midst of hardship there is another road than the road of Job to have to go through all that stuff.
[time=1918] Just trust him.
[time=1919] I know that that is easier than it sounds, but that's what you see him doing.
[time=1923] He had somehow come to the place that he continued to trust God and accept the sovereign plan, and so here you find him in verses 21 to 23,
[time=1931] getting his socks blessed off by the true and living God, albeit in a jail and a dungeon alone and far away.
[time=1942] Continue to trust God against all the evidence. Walk with God. Be humble of heart.
[time=1948] Principle number two.
[time=1950] The second thing that we can learn from Joseph as he goes through this experience, let's read verses 1 to 7 of chapter 40.
[time=1958] Then it came about after these things, the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their Lord.
[time=1965] And Pharaoh was furious with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.
[time=1971] So he put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard in the jail, the same place where Joseph was imprisoned.
[time=1978] And the captain of the bodyguard put Joseph in charge of them, and he took care of them, and they were in confinement for some time.
[time=1986] Then the cupbearer and the baker for the king of Egypt, who were confined in the jail, both had a dream the same night, each man with his own dream and each dream with its own interpretation.
[time=1996] When Joseph came to them in the morning and observed them, behold, they were dejected.
[time=2003] And he asked Pharaoh's officials who were with him in confinement in his master's house, why are your faces so sad today?
[time=2011] Well, the cupbearer, you know the role of the cupbearer before the king. His job was to taste the liquid and the food before the king did to prevent a plot to kill the king by poison.
[time=2022] And the baker was right behind that, the chief baker, because of a plot to murder the king through poison and we're going to come, it might welcome through the kitchen.
[time=2030] And so you find two very, very powerful, very trusted, very influential people, the cupbearer of course being the most trusted.
[time=2036] And often even as you saw in the life of Nehemiah, there grows a relationship of confidentiality and real trust that bonds those two men together.
[time=2045] We don't know what happened, just that Pharaoh was offended there in verse 1 and became furious in verse 2, the details are withheld from us.
[time=2053] But what I want you to notice is in verse 4, it says there that Joseph took care of them.
[time=2061] He was assigned to that task, they were very high influential people, they were given some preference, Joseph of course was in charge of the whole thing, and he was the most trusted among the people in the jail.
[time=2071] And so he was especially appointed to take care of them, to minister to their needs, to meet their physical needs inside that jail.
[time=2081] Look at verse 7, but he goes beyond the physical needs and shows an obvious care for the emotional concerns as well.
[time=2088] Why are your faces so sad today?
[time=2092] Here's the point I'm trying to make and I think what we learn from Joseph is this, because he was trusting in God.
[time=2099] Because he didn't allow bitterness to overcome him and anger and feeling dejected and separated from God, and of course when that occurs, people get incredibly selfish.
[time=2108] People get incredibly ingrown and introverted and there is nothing to give away.
[time=2114] Because he had stayed right with his God, he was in a position to minister to other people, above and beyond the call of duty, not just the physical needs but the emotional needs as well.
[time=2122] Look at verse 8, then they said to him in response to his question, "We have had a dream and there is no one to interpret it."
[time=2130] Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me please."
[time=2136] I find that remarkable.
[time=2138] Wasn't it a dream that Joseph got from God and the interpretation thereof that started this whole horrible chain of events in the first place?
[time=2145] I mean if he hadn't got that stupid dream from God about his sheath being bowed down to by his brother's sheaths there in the wheat field, and if he hadn't told anybody about it, maybe none of this would have ever happened.
[time=2156] But you can see not only does he hold no grudges about that and he has happily submitted to the sovereignty of God, but he is willing to give honor to God in the whole dream process.
[time=2166] Verse 8, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell it to me please." I'm not only gun shy of dreams, I'll tell you where they come from and the interpretation thereof.
[time=2177] It's a remarkable heart of submission before God and a willingness to serve other people.
[time=2182] Well the story line goes, we won't take all the verses to read the dreams, but they both get dreams, they both come out of their vocations, and the cup bearer, it is revealed through Joseph's interpretation of his dream that he will be restored in three days back to his position of power.
[time=2194] And the baker in three days will be hanged.
[time=2199] So you come to verses 20 and following.
[time=2202] Thus it came about on the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, that he made a feast for all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief cup bearer and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
[time=2214] And he restored the chief cup bearer to his office and he put the cup into Pharaoh's hand, but he hanged the chief baker just as Joseph had interpreted to them.
[time=2225] What I find amazing in this part of his life is that I don't think Joseph would have chosen all this hardship, the rejection, the near murder, the slavery, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2237] And many of you are facing incredible hardship in your life that you would not have chosen.
[time=2242] It would not have been your first pick.
[time=2244] It is not how you would have designed the course of your life.
[time=2247] But here's the fact. When God allows that hardship or brings it into your life, it both makes you a more sensitive person to other people in their pain and typically brings you into a whole new group of friends that you never otherwise would have had.
[time=2261] The hardship and the trial, the failure, whatever it is usually introduces you into a whole new sphere of influence in which you can minister.
[time=2270] I think of Steve and Renee Longbreak.
[time=2273] Listen, there's no question. They would not have chosen cancer for Renee.
[time=2277] Last on their list.
[time=2279] They don't particularly care for the treatments and the expenditure of time and the interruption of schedule and the physical weakness that it brings to her and the lack of sleep that they often get and the change of their understanding.
[time=2290] The change of their entire life and who knows what may eventuate with this particular disease in her life as well as she is doing right now.
[time=2298] They would never have chosen that.
[time=2302] But you know what? When I check in with them as they come home over and over and over again there are new people on their hearts because this treatment took them to this particular place and that nurse and that patient and they then those people get a chance to watch Steve and Renee and their love and their faith
[time=2319] and their trust and their willingness to follow a sovereign God and their testimony just begins to spread.
[time=2326] And it's been a source of incredible joy for them.
[time=2330] Different relationships on their very street because of this disease.
[time=2334] It takes them to a whole new group of people to whom they can prosper the gospel.
[time=2341] It's always that way.
[time=2343] If you'll respond rightly.
[time=2346] Dr. William L. Stiger, a seminary professor of old, once fell into deep, deep depression and began to not care about anything at all.
[time=2356] It became introverted and selfish and recluse in nature.
[time=2361] A good friend came to him and challenged him, said this, "Listen, I want you to think back over your life.
[time=2367] I want you to think of the names of the people that have made an investment in your life and the midst of all this depression.
[time=2373] You just rehearse the people that have made differences for good in your life.
[time=2377] Pick one of them and write them a letter and tell them what they did.
[time=2381] And so the guy did that.
[time=2383] Soon he received a little note in shaky handwriting.
[time=2388] He chose to write to a schoolteacher who had given him a love for literature.
[time=2393] And so he pentered this letter telling her how she had inspired in him a love for great poetry and prose and finally received back this little note, dear Willie.
[time=2401] When I read your letter, I was blinded with tears.
[time=2404] For I remember you as a little fellow in my class.
[time=2407] You have warmed my old heart.
[time=2410] I have taught school for 50 years.
[time=2413] Yours is the first letter of thanks I ever received from a student.
[time=2419] I shall cherish it until I die." And then Dr. Steiger wrote another letter to another person, another letter to another person, another letter to another person, all of thanks until he had eventually written over 500 letters of gratitude and thanks to people.
[time=2436] And guess what was gone by the time he was done?
[time=2439] His depression and his selfishness.
[time=2444] I don't mean that as some simplistic little cure to all the depression of the world, but it seems to be a pretty common theme in the Word of God.
[time=2450] The Apostle Paul got imprisoned under house arrest in Rome, right?
[time=2454] And he had a heart for the world.
[time=2455] He wanted to go everywhere and see everybody and tell everybody about Christ and start all kinds of new churches.
[time=2460] And you know the accounting of all the robberies he'd been through in the beatings and the chastisements and the shipwrecks and the sicknesses and all that stuff, right?
[time=2468] And he comes at the end of his life and he's under house arrest in Rome.
[time=2471] And what do you find him doing?
[time=2472] Do you hear him complaining against God and saying, "I don't like your plan for my life.
[time=2476] What are you doing with me?
[time=2477] This isn't fair.
[time=2478] I was supposed to go.
[time=2479] I serve you faithfully and now you incarcerate me for the remainder of my life." No.
[time=2485] What do you find him doing?
[time=2487] Well, for one, he was winning the imperial guard to Christ, those soldiers of Caesar's household.
[time=2494] He also happened to have won Onesimus.
[time=2496] Remember the runaway slave to the Lord and built him up?
[time=2498] And Onesimus became very valuable to him, but thinking of others, Paul sent him back to Philemon.
[time=2505] In that process he received visitors from churches and then wrote letters back to those churches,
[time=2511] heard their concerns, heard their needs, the spiritual deceptions that were going on in their churches, and then wrote Ephesians and Philippians and Colossians and Philemon, thinking of other people, ministering to other people.
[time=2522] And there in Rome, which had been a long desire for him to finally reach, he held an extensive preaching and teaching ministry, albeit in his own home, but people would come and he would teach.
[time=2534] John Bunyan, the great preacher, lived in a day where he was imprisoned for his preaching and the people of his day thought it a great tragedy that such a great order would be locked up in prison.
[time=2544] And you know what he did while he was in there?
[time=2546] He wrote one of the greatest books of all time, Pilgrim's Progress.
[time=2552] I think there's a theme here somewhere that when God brings hardship, one of the reasons
[time=2558] he does it is to allow you to meet and minister to a whole new group of people.
[time=2562] And as long as you keep your attitude and your heart focused in that direction, you'll be okay.
[time=2566] I was visiting one of our elders this week in the hospital, Burt Wright.
[time=2571] He's having trouble with his heart, had a full open heart surgery 17 years ago
[time=2577] and has enjoyed remarkable health through that period of time.
[time=2580] A very, very strong man in physical terms, and yet as of late, his heart continues to bother him.
[time=2586] He was in three months ago.
[time=2587] They couldn't figure it out.
[time=2588] They had just his medicine.
[time=2589] He's in again now.
[time=2590] He was supposed to go home.
[time=2591] The very day they were supposed to let him out this week, he had to stay because he had more problems with his heart and they're having trouble getting a handle around the thing and they're going to adjust his medicine and the plan is, I think, to release him today.
[time=2601] I'm visiting him through this particular week.
[time=2604] About the middle of the week, we're done visiting.
[time=2607] And he says, "Oh, by the way, before you leave, I just have one question." I said, "What's that?" He said, "Who else is in the hospital from our church?" I said, "Well, why do you ask?" He says, "Because they're going to let me walk around today, and I want to go visit him.
[time=2620] I want to go encourage him." Do you realize I have never in my life, I've only known him four years, but I have never heard him once complain about what God is doing in his life, and we talk all about his heart and all about the tenuous nature of solutions and I never hear him complain.
[time=2634] I never hear him grumble.
[time=2635] I never hear him question the love of God or the trusting of God.
[time=2638] All I hear him saying when he does ask the question is, "Who else can I minister to now that I'm in the hospital?"
[time=2645] There's truth in that.
[time=2647] There's real help in that.
[time=2649] Somehow, some way, in the midst of trials, we have to get our eyes off ourself, continue to trust God and give our lives away to people.
[time=2659] And let God take care of the rest.
[time=2662] A third principle.
[time=2664] You've got to be patient.
[time=2666] A third principle from Joseph's life is you've got to really be patient.
[time=2669] Patient.
[time=2670] God is, I think, in love with endurance runners.
[time=2672] If he watches sporting events, I think he watches like cross-country and stuff.
[time=2676] Look at chapter thirty-nine, or excuse me, chapter forty, verse fourteen.
[time=2681] Now this is while he's interpreting these dreams, okay?
[time=2684] And he just told the cut bear of the really good news.
[time=2686] You're going to live.
[time=2687] And then he says, verse fourteen, "Only, hey, keep me in mind when it goes well with you.
[time=2692] And please do me a kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house.
[time=2698] For I was in fact kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and even here I have done nothing that they should have put me into the dungeon."
[time=2705] Nothing wrong with him making that request.
[time=2707] He recognizes the cut bear as coming back into a very influential position with the Pharaoh.
[time=2711] And he's saying, "Look, if there's any chance I can get out of this place, this dungeon, I'd like it.
[time=2716] Would you help me?" I mean, I've helped you.
[time=2718] Would you help me?
[time=2719] I've ministered to you.
[time=2721] Look what happens at the end of the chapter, verse twenty-three.
[time=2724] Yet the chief cut bear did not remember Joseph, but forgot about him.
[time=2730] The guy gets reinstalled as just as Joseph had said, but the cut bear forgets all about him.
[time=2737] How long?
[time=2738] How long do you forget about him?
[time=2740] Well, Genesis chapter forty-one.
[time=2742] Look at the first verse.
[time=2743] Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream.
[time=2749] And behold, he was standing by the nylon.
[time=2751] In fact, the cut bear never did really remember him.
[time=2753] He had to be prodded by this dream of Pharaoh.
[time=2755] But that's two years now, you guys.
[time=2757] Think about that.
[time=2758] Who knows how long he'd already been in prison, three or four years.
[time=2762] Fight his way through this thing.
[time=2764] Interprets these dreams.
[time=2765] Kind of thinks, well, that's familiar.
[time=2767] Maybe this is how God's going to get me out of here.
[time=2769] Minister's the guy, and the guy forgets about him, and he rots there for two more years.
[time=2775] God likes long distance runners.
[time=2777] He's into endurance.
[time=2779] Why?
[time=2780] Because the refining process in our lives tends to take a long time.
[time=2785] Moses, as you know, was in the desert for forty years before God brought him back and used him.
[time=2791] It's not unlike God to spend a long time in the refining process.
[time=2799] The incident of Scott O'Grady caught my eye this week.
[time=2802] You know, the Air Force captain shot down by the Bosnian Serbs and what a remarkable, wonderful story and tremendous thing.
[time=2809] In this article in Time magazine, he gave a couple comments about God.
[time=2813] He said this, "I prayed to God and asked him for a lot of things.
[time=2817] He delivered me throughout the entire time.
[time=2820] When I prayed for rain, he gave me rain.
[time=2823] One time I prayed Lord.
[time=2824] Let me at least have someone know I'm alive and maybe rescue me.
[time=2828] And guess what, O'Grady says?
[time=2830] That night, T.O., came up on the radio.
[time=2833] He made content.
[time=2835] Now that's great, and I'm excited for him, but I want you to know that's not God's typical M.O.
[time=2840] Do you realize what we would be like if within twenty-four hours of the request God was answering just like all the time?
[time=2847] We'd be selfish little monsters.
[time=2849] There would be no character building us.
[time=2851] It would not be good for us.
[time=2852] It would not be healthy for us.
[time=2854] We would be demanding.
[time=2855] We would be in the instant gratification.
[time=2857] We'd have a genie for a God.
[time=2858] We'd be out of control.
[time=2861] God has a way of not only setting us in the hardship for the purpose of refinement, but then letting it stay a long, long time.
[time=2869] And for some of you, it may be until the end of your life.
[time=2874] Endurance.
[time=2875] That's why Psalm 37-7 says this, "Rest in the Lord and wait patiently on Him."
[time=2884] When God puts you in a difficult place, rest in your relationship with Him and be patient, because He will likely take a long time to resolve the issue.
[time=2894] I think we set ourselves up for disappointment with God when we expect the situation turn itself around too quickly, if at all.
[time=2903] F.B. Meyer, a great preacher and commentator, said this about this period of Joseph's life.
[time=2909] As a boy, Joseph's character tended to softness.
[time=2913] He was a little spoiled by his father.
[time=2915] He was too proud of his dreams and foreshadowed greatness.
[time=2919] None of these were great faults, but he lacked strength, grip, power to rule.
[time=2924] But what a difference his imprisonment made in him.
[time=2927] From that moment, he carries himself with wisdom, modesty, courage, and manly resolution that never fail him.
[time=2934] He acts as a born ruler of men.
[time=2936] He carries an alien country through the stress of great famine without a symptom of revolt.
[time=2941] He holds his own with the proudest aristocracy of the time.
[time=2946] He promotes the most radical changes. He has learned to hold his pace and weight.
[time=2952] Surely the iron has entered his soul.
[time=2955] That's good.
[time=2957] That's how God works.
[time=2960] Well, listen.
[time=2963] When hard times come and when hard times stay, try to remember Joseph.
[time=2970] Stay friends with God. Don't lose that.
[time=2975] Begin to serve other people with a new energy.
[time=2978] Look for the new people that God brings through that hardship and don't be impatient.
[time=2984] Let me close with just three words again of application.
[time=2986] One of instruction, one of warning, and one of hope.
[time=2992] The word of instruction here I find so liberating.
[time=2994] I find so encouraging. Listen to this now.
[time=2997] Do you realize that Joseph went through all this hardship with no fault of his own?
[time=3004] This wasn't corrective behavior for some sin in his life.
[time=3008] It was preparatory for an even greater work.
[time=3012] In other words, God was so committed to using him in such a phenomenal way that he had to go through this, not because of his own sin or his own weaknesses, but because God had such great intentions for him.
[time=3023] When you and I find our way into hardship, probably the first response in most of us is to look inside and look for the sin.
[time=3030] Is this the disciplining hand of God? What have I done? How have I fallen short?
[time=3034] Why does God have to do this in my life?
[time=3036] What have I provoked in the hand of God that would bring this hardship into my life as if I've done something wrong?
[time=3040] And that's probably a very good place to start.
[time=3044] But the fact is, having done that inventory, you may find basically nothing.
[time=3049] I mean, sure you have sin in your life, but nothing of the nature that would cause a child to die or a husband to run off and leave you or bankruptcy to be eminent or a loss of a job.
[time=3059] You go on, "I'm just like everybody else around here. I just live in my Christian life." And the answer may be exactly.
[time=3066] It may not have anything to do with what you might have done wrong or been lacking.
[time=3070] It may have everything to do with the preparation that God has for you in future days.
[time=3075] And I hope he can be freed by that to really rest in his love and the assurance of his grace.
[time=3083] As I told you, Joseph is only one of three in the entire Bible whose lives are discussed at any length where we find no description of sin.
[time=3092] It was Joseph and Daniel and Jesus.
[time=3094] Now, Jesus was the only one truly sinless, but Joseph and Daniel were so squeaky clean, there was nothing to write about.
[time=3100] It never got them into significant trouble.
[time=3103] And here he is going through all this stuff.
[time=3106] My friends, the presence of difficulty and hardship and setbacks and trial does not necessarily mean that it is your fault.
[time=3115] It may instead be the blessing of God to prepare you for something wonderful in the future.
[time=3121] A word of warning.
[time=3123] Secondly, a word of warning. Don't get sideways with God.
[time=3127] I mean by that, don't become angry with him.
[time=3129] Distrustful, don't blame him, don't question him with cynicism, don't write him off, and don't quietly take control of your own life.
[time=3136] As hard as your circumstances may be, as contrary to his promises, as your experience may be working itself out from your human limited perspective,
[time=3145] resist at all cost, the temptation to distance yourself from the God who loves you.
[time=3151] Let me read this quote.
[time=3154] It helps.
[time=3155] Whenever we place a higher priority on solving our problems than pursuing God,
[time=3172] That's a powerful statement.
[time=3174] You don't have to run off with some woman to be immoral.
[time=3177] You don't have to go get drunk to be immoral.
[time=3179] You don't have to rob somebody to be immoral. All you have to do is place a higher priority on solving your own problems,
[time=3186] getting your life to look the way you think it ought to look, even in Christian terms.
[time=3190] Place a higher priority on that than pursuing God and you are out of bounds.
[time=3195] Because the essence of Christianity is pursuing God, not getting your life to work out.
[time=3200] Right?
[time=3201] That's a strong warning.
[time=3206] I know it speaks to my life.
[time=3208] I can be very committed and conditional in my relationship with God as my circumstances dictate.
[time=3214] And I stand rebuked because what he has really called me to do is to pursue him and love him unconditionally,
[time=3222] regardless of what happens.
[time=3224] Do you want to know more about that?
[time=3227] Read the book Finding God by Larry Krab.
[time=3229] That's where I took the quote.
[time=3230] Tremendous book, Finding God.
[time=3232] If you're struggling with your circumstances and you find it making you feel distanced from God, read that book.
[time=3239] Let's close them with a word of hope.
[time=3241] A word of hope.
[time=3243] As I was studying this word tested in the Old Testament this week, and this whole purifying deal,
[time=3249] and how it's to purify something to the place that is unmixed and totally reliable,
[time=3256] I found God testing men over and over again, but what was already tested is the Word of God.
[time=3264] The commodity in your life that is 100% pure, reliable, tested, sure and true is the Word of God.
[time=3272] Psalm 1830 says, "As for God, His way is blameless.
[time=3276] The Word of the Lord is tried." That's the Hebrew word.
[time=3281] It's already done.
[time=3282] It's purified.
[time=3284] And then it goes on to say, "He is a shield to all who take refuge in Him."
[time=3290] There are some things that you can count on regardless of what your circumstances tell you, and they are revealed to you in His pure, tried word.
[time=3297] Number one, He does love you with an everlasting love.
[time=3301] Nothing has changed that.
[time=3303] His mercies are new to you every morning, no matter how much you have sinned or strayed, His mercy and forgiveness is new like the sunrise every day.
[time=3312] He will never leave or forsake you.
[time=3316] He is working everything out for your good, as defined and being like Christ.
[time=3323] And what He has begun in your life, He will finish, guaranteed.
[time=3326] Why?
[time=3327] How can I say that to you?
[time=3328] Because the Word of God is tested and tried.
[time=3331] It is pure.
[time=3332] It is true.
[time=3334] Somehow Joseph knew that.
[time=3336] Somehow in the midst of all the darkness of that dungeon and the pain of the past,
[time=3342] he somehow knew that what God had promised He would also do.
[time=3350] And as a result, He took refuge in His God.
[time=3355] Well, let's stand together for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3369] Well, you know, it's amazing thing how the life of Joseph so parallels the life of Christ.
[time=3376] And we've seen so far as we've studied the life of Joseph that he has been tested.
[time=3380] He has been tried and his life has been difficult and very, very hard.
[time=3384] And the part that comes next in Joseph's life is that he is exalted to being the second most powerful man in the world,
[time=3390] the Prime Minister of Egypt.
[time=3392] It was that way with Christ.
[time=3393] The first time he came to the earth, he was humiliated.
[time=3397] He was hated by his brothers.
[time=3399] He was rejected.
[time=3400] He was put to death.
[time=3402] All of that kind of humiliation and sacrifice.
[time=3405] And of course, we know that when Christ comes again, it will be an exalted state full of glory and wonder.
[time=3412] And I wonder where you are in your relationship with Christ today.
[time=3415] Do you realize that when Christ comes back again, He'll have one simple question to ask you about Himself?
[time=3422] Do you love Christ?
[time=3423] Have you given your life to Him?
[time=3425] Have you put your faith in Him for your salvation?
[time=3428] And if you can't answer that question, "Yes," today, or at least right now, we can change that.
[time=3433] If you want to accept Christ as your personal Lord and Savior and be ready for Him when He comes back, I invite you to bow your head and pray with me.
[time=3441] Heavenly Father, I know that I am a sinner.
[time=3443] I know that I have allowed my life to go in ways that are against your Word and I can see the negative results in my life
[time=3451] and I'm tired of my sin and I'm tired of being separated from you and I want to be forgiven and I want to be restored and I want to have purpose and meaning in my life.
[time=3460] And I know that comes through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3463] And so I accept Him as my personal Lord and Savior today.
[time=3466] I thank you that He died on the cross for my sins and my place and that because of His death, I can live.
[time=3473] And I look forward to His coming back as I now trust Him as my personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3478] Pray these things in Jesus' name. Amen.
[time=3481] Well, if you just prayed that prayer, we would love to know about it.
[time=3484] So write us here at the Bible hour and let us know about your decision for Christ.
