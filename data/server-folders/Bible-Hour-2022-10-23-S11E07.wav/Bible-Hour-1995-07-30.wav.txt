[time=0] But for most Christians who have ever lived, the hardship and the toil and the affliction
[time=14] have been the constant.
[time=15] They have been the common denominator of experience.
[time=19] And these believers have been because of the hardship and a position to come to embrace and to grasp and to hold tight to the golden thread that weaves its way through all of Scripture.
[time=30] The promise of deliverance from that hardship and beyond just deliverance all the way to
[time=38] exaltation.
[time=46] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=50] Thank you for joining us.
[time=52] Affliction, mistreatment, persecution, hardship and pain are often characteristic of the
[time=59] Christian walk.
[time=60] But periodically God rescues us from our plight and even rewards us.
[time=65] Stay with us today as we see God rescuing Joseph and rewarding him for his faithfulness.
[time=72] Right now, let's join our service.
[time=89] We are gathered in this house to celebrate his name, to tell him we're happy.
[time=105] So happy day.
[time=109] We know we're make worthy by the bloody day.
[time=131] All of our worship, all of our worship, Jesus our Lord, our Lord, when we're terrified
[time=154] in Jesus, the Lord, we are sheep of His pasture, He knows us by name.
[time=183] And we show that He loves us, He's one just the same.
[time=192] And we all need to see Him in power, and He seems as we praise Him, His Lord, His Son.
[time=213] Oh, we worship, oh we worship, oh we worship, Jesus our Lord, our Lord, we let Him find
[time=237] Him, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord, our Lord,
[time=321] Hi, my name's Russell Moore, and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour, and thank you for joining us today.
[time=326] I just trust you're having a wonderful summer, and I know that as we've been studying through the book of Joseph, we've been reminded of the strife and anxiety that filled that whole family, how the jealousy and the hatred tore it literally apart and separated them by an
[time=341] entire country, and I know my heart and mind has been on my family as a result of looking
[time=347] at Joseph's family, and I know that I want to really strengthen my effort.
[time=351] In fact, even in the last couple of weeks, I've kind of redoubled my energies toward my kids and my wife, I don't want to let summer go by and not come to the end of it with a sense of satisfaction and really delight that we've done some special things, spent some extra time together, built some unique memories together.
[time=368] I don't know if you were to take stock right now, how's your summer going in terms of your family, your wife and your kids, and maybe even in your extended family if they're here in town?
[time=377] Well, God bless you, and trust you'll be encouraged by the message today from God's word.
[time=394] My days are filled with laughter, my heart has known your peace, I've traveled far, still
[time=410] there is far to go, 'cause in my heart there is lying to move upon your face, where your
[time=422] love is, where I want to be, you are like me, you are the land of my energies.
[time=442] You need to leave the head for who we want, so we can be one, king of who I am.
[time=470] Every road I've traveled town, all you have walked before me, and made a light to shine
[time=483] I am looking for the day, whenever before you play my crown at your feet, oh Jesus, you
[time=511] are the land of my energies, you need to be prepared for who we want, 'cause we're
[time=528] the land of my energies, you are the land of my energies, you need to be prepared for
[time=553] you, you need to be prepared for who we want, so we can be prepared for who we want,
[time=602] can be prepared for who we want, so we can be prepared for who we want, so we can be
[time=643] There is no doubting the fact, even as our Lord said, that we will have trouble in this present world.
[time=650] And believers throughout all of history, and we would know the least of this, having the blessings of living here in America where we are so free and so privileged and so blessed.
[time=660] But all through time, believers have known hardship, and they have known toil, and they have known affliction, and they have known suffering.
[time=669] But God comes to them in all their various conditions and says, "I am a God of deliverance, and I will exalt you." There will eventually in your life come a time of blessing and relief and satisfaction and joy.
[time=684] Let's just look at it in general by way of principle, at two different texts, one of the new and one of the old, and then we'll look at it in the life of Joseph.
[time=691] If you would, take your Bible and come to 1 Peter chapter 5, and we'll see this beautiful
[time=697] promise stated so clearly.
[time=701] As you know, the book of 1 Peter was written to Christians in the 1st century church who were under great persecution.
[time=708] They were being socially ostracized.
[time=710] They were the victim of police action.
[time=712] They were having their property seized.
[time=714] They were seen as outcasts.
[time=718] It was a horrible time in which to be a Christian in that sense.
[time=724] And in 1 Peter chapter 5, you'll see this principle in verse 6.
[time=726] He says, God says, "Humble yourselves.
[time=730] Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you at the
[time=736] proper time.
[time=738] Stay underneath God," he says in verse 6, "by humbling yourselves, recognizing that there is a mighty God, and he has a mighty hand, and in his time, and in his way he has
[time=749] promised to exalt you." Verse 7, 8 and 9, tell us a little bit of how to do that, casting your anxiety upon him because he cares for you, be sober of spirit for your adversary of the devil.
[time=762] Verse 9, "Resist your adversary of the devil," and then he returns to the same theme again in verse 10, "And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who
[time=774] called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself perfect, confirm, strengthen, and
[time=781] establish you." That's a promise of God.
[time=786] There is hardship, there is toil, there is affliction, there is persecution, there is trial.
[time=792] James 1 says, "Consider it all joy when you fall into various trials, not if, but coupled
[time=799] with the hardship of being a fallen person living in a fallen world is the magnanimous promise of God that he will deliver and he will exalt."
[time=809] Old Testament Job, chapter 5, and if your Bible is new to you, Psalms and Proverbs kind
[time=815] of are the big books in the middle, turn to your left, go back to the beginning of book and you'll find the book of Job.
[time=822] Now we've touched on the life of Job from time to time in our study of Joseph, but Job chapter 5, unmistakably we see then again the principle of deliverance and exaltation.
[time=835] In Job, chapter 5, verse 6, Job says, "For affliction does not come out of the dust,
[time=841] neither does trouble sprout from the ground." In other words, that stuff doesn't come out of thin air, verse 7, "Man is born for trouble
[time=850] as sparks fly upward," part of being a human, part of living after the fall.
[time=858] Just like sparks fly upward, so man is born for trouble is the point.
[time=861] You can count on it, affliction and trouble are on their way.
[time=866] Verse 8, "But as for me I would seek God, I would place my cause before God."
[time=874] What kind of a God is he?
[time=876] Verse 9, "He's a God who does great and insertiable things, wonders without number." Well what are those wonders?
[time=882] Well verse 10, "He gives rain on the earth and sends water on the fields."
[time=889] What does he do for me and for you?
[time=890] Verse 11, "So that he sets on high those who are lowly and those who mourn are lifted
[time=898] to safety." You can count on it.
[time=903] God has promised it.
[time=907] Let's look at it for a moment this morning in the life of Joseph.
[time=909] Come to Genesis chapter 41.
[time=913] If you've been with us through this study so far, you know that Joseph knew affliction.
[time=918] He knew toil.
[time=919] He knew hardship.
[time=922] And we kind of came to the climax of that hardship and that suffering last time when it dawned on us that it had been two full years that Joseph had already been forgotten in jail.
[time=933] He'd been in jail longer than that, but he'd been forgotten for two full years.
[time=938] With nothing happening today that was any different than yesterday, just being locked up in prison.
[time=946] Once affliction started 13 years prior to this, we know from the beginning of our study that he was 17 years old when his brothers out of hatred and jealousy decided not to kill him but instead sell him into slavery in the Egypt.
[time=957] He's now 30 in Genesis 41, 13 years of this hardship, of rejection, of betrayal, of abandonment,
[time=965] of slavery, of jail, 13 years being lost and alone.
[time=971] And I guess if the story of Joseph's life were to end right here in jail, chapter 41, verse 1, I mean if that were the sum total of his life and he were to die in jail and if he were to be no more, then I would begin to wonder about his God.
[time=987] And I would wonder about the wisdom of serving that God.
[time=990] I would look at that man in his life and say, "My friend, you've made a tragic mistake.
[time=995] You've served the wrong God." Because all that's been for you is heartache and trouble and toil.
[time=1002] You honored your God.
[time=1003] You said no to the temptations.
[time=1005] You gave glory to him at every possible moment and all he gave you back was trial and hardship and death and then nothing.
[time=1014] But our God, the God of this Bible, the God of this church and the God of Joseph is a God of deliverance and a God of exaltation.
[time=1024] And you can see it right here, chapter 41, verse 1.
[time=1027] Now it happened and we'll just run our way through this narrative making comments as we go.
[time=1032] It's a story you kind of have to see or you'll never believe it.
[time=1035] Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh had a dream and behold he was standing by the Nile and low from the Nile there were seven cows, sleek and fat and they
[time=1045] grazed in the marsh grass.
[time=1047] Then behold seven other cows came up after them from the Nile, ugly and gaunt and they stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.
[time=1055] The ugly and the gaunt cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows and then Pharaoh woke up.
[time=1062] He fell asleep in verse 5, dreamed a second time and behold seven years of grain came up on a single stock, plump and good.
[time=1070] Then behold seven years thin and scorched by the east winds sprouted up after them and the thin ears swallowed up the seven plumpful ears.
[time=1078] Then Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream.
[time=1083] This would be a matter of great concern to a man like Pharaoh because most of the economic system of his entire nation in fact the world depended upon the produce of the field and
[time=1094] the multiplication of stock.
[time=1096] It would be like our whole gross national product hanging in the balance.
[time=1102] Verse 8, "Then it came about in the morning that his spirit was troubled so he sent and called for the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men and Pharaoh told them his dreams but there was no one who could interpret them to Pharaoh.
[time=1114] They came up empty.
[time=1115] They had no insight.
[time=1116] They had nothing to offer Pharaoh at all, no counsel, no understanding on the issue at all and then the cup bearer." Remember him?
[time=1123] One of Joseph's friends, "While in prison Joseph helped the cup bearer end the baker by interpreting their dream and rightly interpreted it and said, 'You the cup bearer will be restored to your position as chief cup bearer.
[time=1134] You'll get out of this prison but you, Mr. Baker, you're going to die.
[time=1137] You're going to be hanged in three days and of course that's exactly what happened.' But the dilemma in Pharaoh's life, a dream, two in fact that didn't know how to be interpreted with strong similarities drew the cup bearer back in his mind to the prison experience and suddenly he says, verse 9, "I would make mention today of my own offenses.
[time=1156] Pharaoh was furious with his servants and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the bodyguard, both me and the chief baker.
[time=1162] We had a dream on the same night, he and I, each of us, dreamed according to the interpretation of his own dream.
[time=1168] Now Hebrew youth was with us there a servant of the captain of the bodyguard and we related to them, we related them to him and he interpreted our dreams for us.
[time=1178] To each one he interpreted according to his own dream and it came about that just as he
[time=1184] had interpreted for us so it happened, he restored me in my office but he hanged him.
[time=1190] He's saying, 'Pharaoh, I think I got your guy.' I mean, if all the wise men and all the magicians can't handle this, there may be this young Hebrew still in prison.
[time=1199] It worked for me, verse 14, "Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph and they hurriedly
[time=1207] brought him out of the dungeon and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came to Pharaoh and Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'I have had a dream but no one can interpret it and I have heard it said about you that when you hear a dream, you can interpret it.'"
[time=1224] Look at verse 16, "Then Joseph answered Pharaoh saying, 'It is not in me, God will give Pharaoh
[time=1232] a favorable answer.'" Well, we're not going to go through the relating of the dream from verses 17 to 27 but pick it up here in verse 28 as Joseph begins to interpret the dream, 41 verse 28, "It is as
[time=1246] I have spoken to Pharaoh," this is Joseph speaking, "God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do.
[time=1251] Behold, seven years of great abundance are coming in all the land of Egypt and after them seven years of famine will come and all the abundance will be forgotten in the land of Egypt and the famine will ravage the land.
[time=1264] So the abundance will be unknown in the land because of the subsequent famine for it will be very severe.
[time=1270] Now as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, it means that the matter is determined by God and God will quickly bring it about." So there's his interpretation, Pharaoh, you've got seven great years coming.
[time=1284] And then you've got seven really, really, really bad years.
[time=1286] In fact, the seven bad years will be so bad it will make people forget how good the seven good years were.
[time=1291] They'll run out of everything they've got.
[time=1294] Joseph goes beyond the mere interpretation and presents now a plan of administration,
[time=1300] verse 33.
[time=1302] And now let Pharaoh look for a man discerning and wise and set him over the land of Egypt, 34.
[time=1308] Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers in charge of the land and let them exact the fifth of the product of the land of Egypt and the seven years of abundance.
[time=1317] Then let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain or food in the cities under Pharaoh's authority and let them guard it.
[time=1327] And let the food become a reserve for the land for the seven years of famine which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish during the famine.
[time=1338] So the interpretation, seven good, seven bad, the seven bad will be so bad you'll forget the seven good so you better prepare.
[time=1344] How should I do that?
[time=1345] Get somebody who can oversee this whole process, have him exact the fifth in the seven good years, guard it closely, and when you need it you'll have it.
[time=1353] Now there's the backdrop.
[time=1357] Here comes deliverance and exaltation for Joseph.
[time=1359] Are you ready?
[time=1360] The fulfillment of the promise of God.
[time=1363] Now verse 37, the proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and do all his servants.
[time=1368] Then Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find a man like this in whom is a divine spirit?" So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God," I like that.
[time=1379] Now Pharaoh's talking about the same God Joseph serves, "Since God has informed you of all this, there is no one so discerning and wise as you are.
[time=1388] You shall be over in my house, and according to your command all my people shall do homage only in the throne I will be greater than you." Now get the details.
[time=1397] This is where it gets really amazing.
[time=1399] This is so wonderful.
[time=1400] Look at what God is going to do now with Joseph.
[time=1403] Verse 41, "In Pharaoh said to Joseph, 'See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.'"
[time=1409] He had unlimited authority all over the land of Egypt.
[time=1413] Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring, and he put it on Joseph's hand, you know what that is?
[time=1419] That's like the National MasterCard.
[time=1422] That is the ring that you would wear, and there was a design on it, and you would push it into soft clay that would appear on documents.
[time=1428] And it was the power through this signet ring to negotiate deals and then bind the wealth of all of Egypt to back those deals up.
[time=1437] This is unlimited financial authority over all the wealth and store of Egypt.
[time=1442] What is right on his ring right there?
[time=1444] Just all happened in the day.
[time=1445] Get it?
[time=1446] I mean he woke up in the morning, he was in prison.
[time=1447] He got called, he got shaved, he got changed, he told the dream, and now this is happening.
[time=1451] Didn't stop there.
[time=1453] The universe 42, "Clothed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold necklace around
[time=1460] his neck." So now he's wearing the clothes of a king.
[time=1466] Verse 43, and he said, "Ride in the second chariot," meaning I'll ride in the first one, which might have been a little bigger or a little more ornate, but you've got to imagine in your mind this is drawn by beautiful white stallions and it's gold everywhere and it's huge and it's gorgeous, and if that isn't enough, at the universe 43 sends a detail.
[time=1484] Every time Joseph goes anywhere, there's a group of men, soldiers, no doubt, that go and proclaim bow the knee.
[time=1489] Here comes Joseph bow down.
[time=1491] Here comes Joseph bow down and set him over all the land of Egypt.
[time=1498] Then he gave him a new name, or rather, verse 44, "Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission no one shall raise hand or foot in all the land of Egypt." Now is the new name.
[time=1510] Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zephanoth Pinnah, Zephanoth Pinnah, and he gave him Asinath,
[time=1519] the daughter of Potipharah's priest of on as his wife.
[time=1522] Now he said, "What in the world is going on here?
[time=1525] Why would he want a name like that?" Well, you see the little part there that says Nath, N-A-T-H?
[time=1531] That is an Egyptian goddess, and it is the one through which the other gods speak.
[time=1539] And so Pharaoh gives to Joseph, change his name, don't call that guy Joseph anymore, call him this, and this is what they would have heard.
[time=1547] God lives and speaks.
[time=1550] That's great.
[time=1551] Hey, look, he showed up.
[time=1552] God lives and speaks, just showed up, which every time he goes anywhere, every time he's addressed, every time these guys say bow the knee, it is a bold recollection of the wonder
[time=1562] of the interpretation of Pharaoh's dreams that set this whole planet in motion.
[time=1565] Here is the uniquely chosen one through whom God speaks.
[time=1570] It's amazing.
[time=1573] Gave him this wife who also has that same part of her name, Nath.
[time=1577] So the couple goes together, wherever they go, and by the way, Joseph had no choice in this matter.
[time=1582] He was assigned the wife.
[time=1583] He took the wife, but God used her in a wonderful way.
[time=1590] Look at verse 51, "The exaltation goes beyond all the ornate stuff, and the chariot, and the ring, and the clothes, and the power." The exaltation includes his own heart, his loneliness for family.
[time=1601] Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh.
[time=1604] You see that in verse 51, "Joseph chose a name as children, names that would describe his own attitude towards God," so he says, "For God has made me forget all my trouble, and all my father's household." So, man, the exaltation that God has given me is so full, and so rich, and so complete that when I think back now on my brothers, and I think back now on that pit, and I think back now on those Ishmaelites, and the long ride into Egypt, and the slavery, and being bought, and being falsely accused, and sitting in prison, there's no more pain in that memory anymore.
[time=1635] I've taken the sting out of all my past, and so I'll call my son Manasseh.
[time=1640] So, every time I see him, and every time I call his name, I realize that God has made me forget.
[time=1645] He didn't forget.
[time=1646] You'll find later in the book he could tell you in great detail what his brothers did to him.
[time=1650] It took the sting out of the memory, and the next son's name helps you understand why.
[time=1654] Look at verse 52.
[time=1655] He named the second Ephraim, which means, "For God has made me fruitful in the land of
[time=1661] my affliction." I get it now, God.
[time=1663] I see what you were doing.
[time=1665] Now it all makes sense, and I understand the great fruitfulness that you've brought to me through my affliction, and so I'll praise God, Manasseh and Ephraim.
[time=1675] There is no poor pain in my memory, because I see the wonder of God's hand in my life.
[time=1680] What could be better?
[time=1686] But it's more than that.
[time=1687] Look at verse 56.
[time=1688] It gives him unparalleled success in what he does.
[time=1691] When the famine was spread over all the face of the earth, then Joseph opened all the storehouses
[time=1697] and sold to the Egyptians, and the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
[time=1702] What was that like?
[time=1704] Everybody you know is starving.
[time=1706] It's year one of the famine were okay.
[time=1708] It's year two were okay.
[time=1709] It's year four.
[time=1710] We're getting a little lean.
[time=1711] It's year five, man.
[time=1712] We're out of stuff, and the ground will produce, and the herds are gone, and I don't know how to feed my wife and kids.
[time=1719] They all came to Pharaoh.
[time=1722] Look up on verse verse 55, "So in all the land of Egypt was famished that people cried out to Pharaoh for bread, and Pharaoh didn't say all solve your problem.
[time=1730] He said, 'Go to Joseph.'" Oh, man.
[time=1736] Whatever he says to you, you shall do.
[time=1740] Talk about famous.
[time=1742] Talk about being well-liked.
[time=1744] Talk about being appreciated.
[time=1748] How come you're eating today?
[time=1749] You're eating today because of Joseph, because God speaks and lives through Joseph, and Joseph provides.
[time=1756] But it wasn't just in Egypt.
[time=1757] Look at verse 57.
[time=1758] 57 says, "And the people of all the earth came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph because
[time=1764] the famine was severe in all the earth." This is international acclaim, folks.
[time=1769] The whole world is now coming to bow at the feet of Joseph so they can live another day.
[time=1776] It's come a long way, hasn't it?
[time=1780] It's come out of the hardship.
[time=1785] He's come out of the rejection.
[time=1788] Now he's king of all the land.
[time=1789] He wears the signet ring of the king.
[time=1791] He wears the clothing of the king.
[time=1792] He drives the chariot of the king.
[time=1794] He has a name that's above the king's name.
[time=1796] God speaks.
[time=1797] He has a wife.
[time=1799] He has children, and he has unparalleled success.
[time=1805] Now here's the clincher.
[time=1807] We skipped it on purpose.
[time=1808] Go back to verse 46.
[time=1811] Look at this.
[time=1813] Now Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
[time=1820] Man, 30.
[time=1824] Every day I live, that sounds younger.
[time=1826] I mean, he's in his prime.
[time=1828] I mean, he's got all this restoration and he's back on track.
[time=1832] He was better than he ever was, God delivered him and exalted him when he was still young enough to enjoy the whole thing for the rest of his life.
[time=1843] Now I'm going to stop talking about Joseph.
[time=1844] I'm going to start talking about us.
[time=1847] I wish I could stand up here today and on the authority of God's Word, promise you that
[time=1855] your time of deliverance and exaltation will come in a timely fashion during your lifetime
[time=1862] when you can both appreciate it and enjoy it, but I cannot.
[time=1869] I cannot make that promise because the Word of God doesn't.
[time=1873] There is nowhere in all of God's Word that guarantees you and me the deliverance exaltation
[time=1882] experience in this lifetime.
[time=1886] Some of you will have that.
[time=1887] Some of you already have.
[time=1888] Some of you could stand up here and tell the wonders of God's grace, the great affliction that was and the wonderful marvelous deliverance and exaltation and the satisfaction of your
[time=1898] heart that is.
[time=1900] You would be like Joseph.
[time=1901] You would be like Daniel who went into the affliction of the lion's den and saw his way out the other side.
[time=1906] You would be like Job who at the beginning of life had everything then lost everything but before he died, God gave him back far beyond what he had originally had.
[time=1917] Nothing wrong with that.
[time=1919] It's just never promised.
[time=1924] Most Christians, most Christians who have ever lived will not have the path of Joseph and Daniel and Job.
[time=1930] They will have the path of Christ, the path of Christ, who during his period here on earth,
[time=1939] those 33 years knew nothing of deliverance and exaltation.
[time=1944] All he knew was the joy of obedience and the suffering of obedience and the trial of obedience
[time=1950] and the misunderstandings of obedience.
[time=1953] Coming unto his own who received him not, the total misunderstanding of an entire nation and world who had got on the planet and failed to fall down and worship him every minute of every day.
[time=1962] He never got any of that.
[time=1966] All he got was suffering and hardship and trial and toil and misunderstanding and loneliness
[time=1973] and rejection and despair even by those who loved him most.
[time=1984] The deliverance exaltation part of the equation came in the life of our Lord after he died.
[time=1993] Then he was delivered and then he was exalted.
[time=1998] I wish I could say to you wives who are here today that the power of God and the promises
[time=2005] of God as you would submit and as you would obey and as you would trust and as you would
[time=2011] pray that God guarantees after this hardship while you are still young enough to enjoy it,
[time=2017] maybe seven years, maybe 13 years of trial that God will then deliver and exalt you, meaning your husband will either come to Christ or begin to live for Christ and come to the profound awareness of how much he has abused you and left you lonely and scarred your soul and dedicate the rest of his life to serving you.
[time=2034] I wish I could say that.
[time=2037] It's just not there.
[time=2042] Wish I could say to you who are grieving the loss of a loved one, that there would be a time in your life where all the pain, the sorrow of that would be gone and the memory
[time=2052] of all you hope for as you approach to certain age that the pain that it's not there, it never will be there.
[time=2058] I wish I could say, "Ah, God's going to deal with that.
[time=2060] He'll give you deliverance.
[time=2061] He'll give you exaltation.
[time=2062] He'll maybe bring somebody new or it won't matter that you lost your spouse and you'll have the best remaining 20 years of your life you ever could have hoped for." It's not there.
[time=2073] Wish I could say to those of you who are struggling with ill health, cancer, heart problems, all there'll be a time of suffering, there'll be a time of affliction but you hang on and you stay faithful and you remain in God's Word and God's promise of deliverance and exaltation will come in a seasonable time.
[time=2091] It's not there.
[time=2093] Those of you who have grown up in financial hardship, who never really had much, never had as much as everybody else had, never really had the financial freedom just to kind of buy a couple of extra things and shower a little bit of financial stuff on somebody else, never grew up with that and from the look of it never will and you look at other
[time=2111] believers and you say, "Man, what would it be like just to have a little bit extra?"
[time=2117] I wish I could say to you, "Hey, you stay faithful to God's Word, you work diligently, you pray, you obey and God in a seasonable way will bring deliverance and exaltation from your financial trials and hardships and you'll have a little extra and you'll be able to just do some fun things because they're fun." It's not there.
[time=2140] It's not there.
[time=2141] You realize that you and I are called to a life of obedience and love and to give ourselves
[time=2149] even in the hard situations embracing the reality that that hard situation will remain
[time=2156] or may get worse before time is over but there is the promise of a place called heaven.
[time=2170] There is the promise of a place called heaven and there is total deliverance and unparalleled,
[time=2180] unfathomable exaltation for you and for me.
[time=2189] Let me try to bring this together in just kind of as we're even wrapping up in three
[time=2195] words of application as I have in the past, lessons on Joseph, a word of instruction, a word of warning and a word of hope.
[time=2202] I think we get the picture.
[time=2203] Let me try to bring it now to a place that you can do something with it, a word of instruction,
[time=2209] a word of instruction and if for that would you come back to first Peter, only this time chapter 1, first Peter chapter 1.
[time=2219] First Peter chapter 1 verse 13.
[time=2234] It says in first Peter chapter 1 verse 13, "Therefore," now remember these are the dispersed, these are the suffering, these are the persecuted, "therefore, gird your minds for action, keep
[time=2246] sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation
[time=2255] of Jesus Christ." The word of instruction this morning is this, learn to hope, learn to hope for your deliverance
[time=2265] and your exaltation and I mean that in terms of heaven itself.
[time=2273] The Bible tells us in this verse and in other places which we don't have time to go through this morning that one of the great secrets of a meaningful Christian life is that you
[time=2286] have cultivated the ability to hope as you see it in verse 13, fixing your hope completely
[time=2292] on what, the grace, that's heaven itself, that's the wonder of God's forgiving grace
[time=2298] fully experienced when you see Jesus, that is the end of your life.
[time=2308] I learned a little bit about this as a secular concept when I was just in high school, unsaved
[time=2315] but my parents felt it was important for me to have a job that I do more all day than run around and play golf and have fun and stuff that I used to like to do so much.
[time=2326] I get this job and we're going to convert this big warehouse, used to be a feed greenery
[time=2333] and a very sharp shrewd contractor, developer guy bought it, it was up in Solvang, California which is a tourist trap and there wasn't a whole lot of people buying grain anymore for their horses that used to kind of be living in the Sanínez Valley where I grew up and it was a prime location so he bought it and he was going to convert it into a whole bunch of shops, just a whole bunch of shops, people wandered through this mill and buy all kinds of stuff and the base of this huge mill was a big floor with huge plank wood and beams
[time=2362] underneath that and pillars that held that up that came right up out of the dirt and it was about three and a half feet high and that's where they put like the loading dock for all the grain and they wanted to keep most of that floor, they were going to build on top of it but there was a part they had cut out and they needed a water line from way back in the corner underneath this false flooring about 40 feet out to where they could work with it.
[time=2383] I was the new kid on the job, low man on the totem pole, no seniority here, I remember
[time=2390] Bruce Stevens walking me over putting his arm around me, coming over here he says now you see, see this dirt here and see this floor here, what we need to do is we need to go back all the way to that wall and I couldn't see the wall because it was dark underneath there, well there's a wall back there, you go all the way back there you dig us a trench that's three feet deep and two feet wide, I said okay, okay so I could work with a shovel
[time=2412] you know the first three or four feet but then you're underneath, I said I don't know how do I keep going and he handed me, he handed me a hammer with a claw on the back of it
[time=2423] and said scratch your way back there, yeah it's true, well the first day I got about five
[time=2430] feet and the next day I got another 10 feet and the third day I got another deal with 35 feet, I learned a hope when I was under there, you know what I hope for, three o'clock,
[time=2443] I hope for three o'clock, when is this going to get over and I'm under there with the spiders
[time=2450] and the mice and all the junk and I'm kind of scared but I wouldn't let anybody know and I'm digging under there and this thing's right on my head and I'm laying on the dirt and I'm digging this hole and scratching it out and I began to learn how to hope with vivid imagination, I didn't just think of generic three o'clock, I mean I saw myself getting out of that hole and then going home and showering and then I would play the rest of the day in great detail over and over and over again because I wasn't going to sit there and think about this all day, that is exactly what God means when he says you gird
[time=2484] your mind for action, you be careful what you think about, you let your mind sink into
[time=2490] the mire of this sinful place and the sinful reality and the hardships and the trials and you go off on that forever and pretty soon you won't have what it takes to take another dig, gird your mind for action, do what else, keep your spirit sober, now watch, fix your
[time=2507] hope on what, the appearing of Jesus Christ when this whole mess is over forever, it'll
[time=2516] not only come three o'clock, it'll never turn eight a.m. again, you'll never have to hold the hammer again, you'll never have to go back in that dark little hole, called earth, called our lives, it's as if God saying to us about the hardship in our life would
[time=2537] say it this way, you, you could endure it, the hardship in the trial, you could endure it with joy if you knew how good I am, you want me to prove my goodness on your terms,
[time=2549] but if I yield to your demand you will not trust me, you will rather come to think you own me, we think of the goodness of God and we say how could a good God leave me in this condition this long and God says you're missing it, you've got to see the ultimate plan that
[time=2565] I have in mind, don't define my goodness on me meeting your terms on your terms because if I do you'll think you own me and it's actually the opposite, it goes on, the words of God potentially, you say I will do something more necessary to your eventual happiness
[time=2581] than solving your problems, I will let you discover my infinite goodness so that you can rest joyfully in your relationship with me, even though problems will continue until
[time=2592] I move you into the better place I am preparing for you.
[time=2600] One of the reasons God lets our lives kind of go south is because he wants us to cultivate the ability to fix our hope on the grace that comes when Christ shows up.
[time=2613] An elderly retired pastor approached another preacher after a service where he had preached
[time=2619] on unanswered questions in the Christian's life, why is God doing this, why do bad things happen to good people, how could someone like me who has lived as obediently as I have have to endure this, this old preacher was short, this man, he was a short thin man with
[time=2635] a clear mind and a passion I could feel as he spoke.
[time=2639] He put his hand on my shoulders, looked up at me with an intense gentle stare and said I am 87 years old, I lost my wife four years ago, I have never known such pain.
[time=2651] I have begged God to take it away, to give me a sense of his presence that would ease the terrible loneliness I feel.
[time=2658] He has not done so, but he has given me a taste of his goodness, I have a glimpse of
[time=2668] what he has in store for me and I am content until I go home, that's what hope does.
[time=2677] Hope produces a contentment to suffer the ill treatment of this present age because you
[time=2683] know there is an ending to it and when it ends the good stuff begins and the good stuff never stops.
[time=2693] The slaves of the south in our nation's history knew this principle very well.
[time=2698] Do you realize what they knew as life?
[time=2701] Do you know what they knew as life?
[time=2703] They knew nothing but working from sun up until sundown every single day of their life
[time=2710] until they were too broken and too old to work any longer and the monotony of that pain was sometimes punctuated by the harsh, cruel, ungodly treatment of masters who would abuse them in every way conceivable.
[time=2723] Where is their hope?
[time=2726] They have no rights.
[time=2727] They have no ability to think that tomorrow will be any better than yesterday was for them and the yesterday was for their father and their grandfather, locked in a system of
[time=2737] misery and trial and abuse.
[time=2741] You know what they did?
[time=2743] Any of them profound Christians and deep in their faith, they began to hope for heaven
[time=2752] and they would gather around the campfires at night and you could hear I am told and have read, songs of deliverance and exaltation coming from deep within their hearts because
[time=2763] they wanted it so badly.
[time=2767] One of them reads this way.
[time=2769] I am a poor pilgrim of sorrow.
[time=2773] I'm tossed in this wide world alone.
[time=2778] No hope have I for tomorrow.
[time=2782] So I've started to make heaven my home.
[time=2788] Sometimes I'm tossed and driven.
[time=2791] Sometimes I don't know where to roam but I've heard of a city called heaven and I've started
[time=2803] to make it my home.
[time=2807] Dreaming, they're already there.
[time=2810] I can see the day, I fix my hope completely on the grace to be given to me at the revelation of Jesus Christ and though I am physically stuck and will get up tomorrow and work this field again, I've heard of a city called heaven and I'm already living there.
[time=2830] That's good.
[time=2832] That's what that verse means and we need to know more of it.
[time=2836] We are so insulated, aren't we?
[time=2838] From anything that's really hard, most of us, that we have little opportunity to develop the hope.
[time=2844] Let me give you a word of warning.
[time=2847] You say, "Why is it so important for me to live like this and have this hope?" Because this hope will purify you.
[time=2855] Turn over now to 1 John chapter 3, oh and this is beautiful.
[time=2861] 1 John chapter 3, verse 3, it's just back a book to your right, a book or two.
[time=2869] 1 John chapter 3, verse 3, it says this, "And everyone who has this hope fixed on him
[time=2880] purifies himself just as he is pure." You want to know why you need this hope?
[time=2886] Because without this hope, when the hardship of life comes, you and I will be tempted to
[time=2892] opt out to a secondary reality called the passing pleasures of sin for a season.
[time=2897] And we will say obedience is too costly, it isn't worth it.
[time=2900] I demand relief and I'm taking it right here and right now in this world system.
[time=2906] John calls him the lust of the world.
[time=2908] Look at chapter 2, verse 16, "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and
[time=2915] the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life is not from the Father, it is from the world, but he cautions the world is passing away in all of its lusts.
[time=2926] But the one who does the will of God abides forever." You say, "How do I do the will of God?
[time=2932] How do I resist the temptation to extricate myself from the painful reality of my life and stay faithful to love God and stay faithful to love people even though it may never change my life, even though I get stuck in this thing, all my life, how do I do that?"
[time=2949] Chapter 3, start at verse 1 this time, "Oh, see how great a love the Father has bestowed
[time=2955] upon us that we should be called the children of God." For this reason, the world does not know us.
[time=2963] There's your persecution and your hardship and your trial and your adversity, because it did not know him.
[time=2968] It killed him.
[time=2969] What do you expect him to do to you?
[time=2970] Verse 2, "Beloved, now we are the children of God and it has not appeared as yet what
[time=2976] we shall be." You see the tension?
[time=2979] We're already born again.
[time=2980] We're already citizens of heaven.
[time=2981] We're already the children of God.
[time=2983] Not yet, it was not fully.
[time=2985] It doesn't appear yet.
[time=2986] Why?
[time=2988] Look at the end of verse 2, "We know that when he appears, we shall be like him because we shall see him just as he is." Now verse 3, "And if you have this hope, if you have it fixed on him, you will purify
[time=3005] yourself.
[time=3007] You will be able to say no to the compromising decisions of life which look very attractive
[time=3014] because life is so hard sometimes because you know Jesus is coming and when he comes,
[time=3023] all my life, all my life, deliverance and exaltation beyond your wildest dreams forever."
[time=3037] One last word now, a word of hope, about hope.
[time=3041] And for this one, if you'd come to Hebrews chapter 11 for just a minute, we're really almost done.
[time=3048] Hebrews chapter 11, this is a word of hope about hope.
[time=3060] It says in chapter 11, verse 1, "Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the
[time=3067] conviction of things not seen." You know what that means?
[time=3072] That means that in the present experience of life, as hard as it is, our faith and our
[time=3079] hope allows us to taste from time to time some of the wonder of heaven, even though we're
[time=3087] still here.
[time=3088] Do you realize that when you sit there across the table from a dearly beloved brother or sister in Christ and you enter into the kind of meaningful fellowship that touches their soul and touches your soul that you are tasting some of the splendor of heaven because that is what heaven is about, unhindered fellowship with the redeemed?
[time=3107] Do you realize that when you look into the Word of God and he through his spirit enlightens your eyes to see a spiritual truth and you go, "Man, that's good." You are tasting in a forw taste a little bit of heaven because we will sit at his feet and bask in his knowledge and his wisdom and the glory of his Word for all of eternity.
[time=3126] You see, God along the way, this troublesome journey, he gives us by our faith and the
[time=3132] power of that faith to make things real what are yet distanced we get to taste ever so briefly.
[time=3140] Little bits of heaven.
[time=3142] My counsel to you today is to cherish them, oh, cherish them, receive them as the gift
[time=3150] of God that they are, and say, "Oh, that was cool, that was a little bit of heaven right there, that's good stuff, that's worth waiting for, that's worth honoring God for.
[time=3162] I'm in for this, count me in," and say, "No to the temptations, no, I'm right here, this is good, this is worth it." Allow that hope to provide momentary points of satisfaction along the way which spur you
[time=3179] on to greater levels of obedient.
[time=3185] Joe Bailey wrote a book entitled, "A View from the Hearst."
[time=3193] Joe knew a little bit about hardship and trial.
[time=3195] He lost his three sons, Danny, John, and Joe.
[time=3199] One of them even was lost before he turned five to leukemia.
[time=3206] Joe writes it this way, "One Saturday morning in January I saw the mail truck stop at our
[time=3213] mailbox up on the road.
[time=3216] Without thinking except that I wanted to get the mail, I ran out of the house and up the road in my shirt sleeves.
[time=3221] It was bitterly cold, the temperature was below zero.
[time=3225] There was a brisk wind from the north and the ground was covered with more than a foot of snow.
[time=3230] I opened the mailbox and pulled out the mail and was about to make a mad dash for the house when I saw what was on the bottom underneath the letters, a burpee seed catalog.
[time=3241] On the front were bright zinnias.
[time=3243] I turned it over, on the back were huge tomatoes.
[time=3246] For a moment I was oblivious to the cold, delivered from it.
[time=3250] I leaped through the catalog, tasting corn and cucumbers, smelling roses.
[time=3255] I saw the freshly plowed earth, smelled it, and let it run through my fingers.
[time=3260] For those brief moments I was living in the springtime and summer, winter was passed.
[time=3267] Then the cold penetrated to my bones and I ran back to the house.
[time=3274] When the door was closed behind me and I was getting warm again, I thought how those moments
[time=3280] at the mailbox were like our experience as Christians.
[time=3284] We feel the cold, along with those who do not share our hope.
[time=3288] The biting wind penetrates us as them, but in our cold times we have a seed catalog,
[time=3296] the Bible.
[time=3297] We open it and smell the promise of spring, eternal spring, and the first fruit that settles
[time=3306] our hope is Jesus Christ who was raised from death and the cold earth to glory, eternal.
[time=3317] We have a great hope.
[time=3320] We need to gird our minds toward that hope.
[time=3324] We need to say no to the passing pleasures of sin by the power of that hope.
[time=3333] And when God gives us the foretaste of glory and the wonder of what it means to be saved and to no other believers and to relish in His word, we need to say thank you, thank
[time=3344] you.
[time=3345] I'll keep going.
[time=3347] Well, let's stand for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3366] Well, it's truly an exciting promise that God has made that He will deliver and eventually
[time=3388] exalt.
[time=3389] And of course, as we've noted today, we can't guarantee that it'll happen in our lifetime, the promise guarantees that it will eventually happen if not in our lifetime than for sure in heaven.
[time=3399] But of course, this promise comes only to people who have accepted Jesus Christ as their
[time=3405] personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3407] Apart from a personal relationship with Christ, God has a completely different promise.
[time=3411] It is not one of deliverance and exaltation.
[time=3415] God calls it eternal separation from His presence for all of eternity.
[time=3420] And so without Christ, a person could live their entire life as hard, full of affliction and persecution and that cold that reaches both the believer and the unbeliever alike, both the Christian and the non-Christian.
[time=3431] And a person could live their whole life in the hardship of life and have nothing to look forward to after death except more estrangement from God and more punishment and a kind of
[time=3441] existence that's far worse than anything that could happen to us here on earth.
[time=3446] The promise for deliverance and exaltation comes through accepting Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=3452] That means that you admit to God, you are sinful, you admit to Him, you need His forgiveness and that you can have that only through Christ, not through your works, not through earning it, not through deserving it.
[time=3462] I invite you to bow your head and pray with me at this time if you'd like to accept Christ.
[time=3466] Father, I want to accept Jesus Christ as my Savior right now and so I admit to you that I am a sinner, I admit to you that I cannot earn salvation, it comes as a free gift.
[time=3477] I put my faith in Jesus Christ as to be my Savior, pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[time=3483] Well, if you just made that decision, if you just prayed that prayer, we would love to know about it here at the Bible hour so we can send you some information to encourage you along your way.
