[time=0] 'Our hope as Christians is in the life to come.'
[time=17] And Pastor Moore encouraged us last week to imagine and think about heaven and what that's
[time=25] going to be like.
[time=26] And as I sat there listening, I thought that it might be a good opportunity for me to just continue that thought and today help create for you a picture of what our future is going
[time=37] to be like.
[time=38] I want to talk to you about, to give you a picture of your ultimate home.
[time=49] Welcome to the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=54] Thanks for joining us.
[time=55] The homes we might see on the best tour of the finest home journal can't even come close
[time=61] to the place God has prepared for His children.
[time=64] Join us today as our Associate Pastor Tim Teder takes a look at what our new home and
[time=70] lives will be like.
[time=72] Right now, let's join our service.
[time=74] The promise of God is, "I will never leave you or forsake you." I mean, aren't you glad that God is present with us now?
[time=81] I mean, He's here, He is with us right now.
[time=86] Yet some of you may be going through circumstances that make it difficult for you to believe that, believe that He is with us.
[time=94] Throughout His Word, the invitation is clear.
[time=97] Come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden and I will give you rest.
[time=102] Many of us sometimes feel unworthy and unready to respond to this invitation of God because of our guilt.
[time=108] We focus on our weakness rather than on His mercy and strength.
[time=112] For the sacrifice of Jesus has made it possible for you and for me to come boldly before the throne of grace to receive mercy and grace in our times of trouble.
[time=123] So I want to invite you to respond to His invitation with me.
[time=127] And right now, let's enter into worship this time.
[time=138] No way like sheep have gone astured.
[time=144] Each of us turning our own separate way.
[time=149] We have all sinned and fallen short of your glory.
[time=159] But your glory is what we desire to see and in your presence is where we are.
[time=168] We belong to be alone.
[time=174] Show us your mercy and grace.
[time=179] Take us to your holy place for give mercy and to your land we want to be in your presence
[time=195] once again.
[time=207] Taking our sickness, taking our pain, Jesus the sacrifice of God has been slain.
[time=218] He was despised, rejected by men, each of us sin.
[time=227] Draw us near to you, Father, through Jesus your Son.
[time=233] Let us worship before you cleanse for your love, all glory.
[time=242] Show us your mercy and grace.
[time=247] Take us to your holy place for give mercy and to your land we want to live in your presence
[time=263] once again, show us your mercy and grace take us to your holy place for give mercy and
[time=282] to your land we want to live in your presence again.
[time=301] We'll return to our service in just a moment, but right now I'd like to tell you about our special gift from the Bible Hour, a lovely digital desk clock with an inspiring picture
[time=311] of two climbers forging up a mountain side and the inscription together we achieve the
[time=317] extraordinary.
[time=318] This handsome teamwork digital desk clock is our free gift to you when you write to the Bible Hour.
[time=324] Stay tuned I'll be giving you our address at the end of the program.
[time=350] The house of the wise man is certain to stand, built upon the rocket with stay, you alone
[time=368] are the foundation for the rest of my life, Lord I want to build my world around you,
[time=375] build my world around hope, build my world where there's mercy and grace, where there
[time=386] is faith, build my world around love, build my world around all that is true, build my
[time=396] world right at the center of all of my life, you're not just a part, you're the whole,
[time=410] and nothing else matters if we're not right, you truly are my heart and my soul, you are
[time=420] the world around my salvation, you're the best of my life, Lord you know my world revolves
[time=429] around you, build my world around hope, build my world where there's mercy and grace, where
[time=437] there is faith, build my world around love, build my world around all that is true, build
[time=447] my world, I believe you'll prepare for me, a resting place when we're through, and I
[time=458] believe you will carry me for the rest of forever, until we're together, I will build
[time=467] my world around you, build my world around hope, build my world where there's mercy and
[time=487] grace, where there is faith, build my world around love, build my world around all that
[time=496] is true, build my world around you, build my world around hope, build my world around
[time=520] you, build my world around love, build my world around love, build my world around
[time=560] I don't know why I can't seem to remember things that you never forget, yet you call
[time=569] me like a voice in the wind, you call me, time it again, that there is nothing that will
[time=579] call against me, that doesn't pass through your hands, so I'm finding that you're faithful
[time=587] and true, and I'm facing all my trust in you, there is a love that knows no limits, it
[time=598] is not bound by what we see, there is a hope that is eternal, able to reach the deepest
[time=609] of me, don't we only try to convince me, that you can never be enough, without hearts
[time=621] that have been broken, there is a love, I don't know why you would ever consider
[time=635] laying your life on the line, yet you show me the true love of a friend, that there is
[time=649] nothing that can come between us to separate me from you, so I'm finding that you're faithful
[time=658] and true, and I'm facing all my trust in you, there is a love that knows no limits, it
[time=669] is not bound by what we see, there is a hope that is eternal, able to reach the deepest
[time=679] of me, don't we try to convince me, that you can never be enough, where there are hearts
[time=691] that have been broken, there is a love, there is a love that knows no limits, it is not
[time=703] bound by what we see, there is a hope that is eternal, able to reach the deepest of me,
[time=714] don't we try to convince me, that you can never be enough, where there are hearts that
[time=724] have been broken, there is a love that knows no limits, it is not bound by what we see,
[time=733] there is a hope that is eternal, able to reach the deepest of me, don't we try to convince
[time=746] me, that you can never be enough, where there are hearts that have been broken, there is
[time=755] a love that knows no limits, it is not bound by what we see, there is a hope that is eternal,
[time=766] able to reach the deepest of me, don't we try to convince me, that you can never be enough,
[time=777] where there are hearts that have been broken, there is a love.
[time=793] Have you ever really longed for that to be true, I mean to have eyes open to the point
[time=800] that you could see the presence of Christ or see the presence of God, you probably have,
[time=806] I mean I have, whether it is in times of real despair or real longing to know God more or
[time=813] times of difficulty in our lives, there have been times with me that I have just, I have
[time=819] begged God, please God in some way just show yourself, there have been some late nights when I have come into this room, when it has all been dark and shut down, and I have stood in this room and just prayed to God and I have cried out, God would you just show something of yourself to me, you know what, He never has.
[time=839] And He has never promised that He would in this life, but that longing in us to see Christ
[time=845] and to see God is something that is part of what He has created in us as Christians and
[time=852] it just prepares us for the day when we will see Him face to face, it is a longing that will one day be fulfilled though it may never be fulfilled in this life, one day it will be.
[time=864] Last week our pastor was continuing in his series on the life of Joseph and taught us
[time=871] concerning God's deliverance from Joseph's life and he made a couple of points that I
[time=877] just like to remind you of this morning.
[time=881] First of all he said that God that makes no guarantees concerning our deliverance from suffering in this life.
[time=888] We may go through tremendous hardships and difficulties in this life and there is never the guarantee in Scripture that God is going to overcome those and we will realize His blessing and comfort in this life.
[time=899] It may be that for some their lot will be to suffer all through this life.
[time=909] And then pastor Russ reminded us that our only ultimate hope is in heaven to realize the blessings of God.
[time=917] The completion of our salvation that God will give it to us someday after this life on earth is done.
[time=923] Now we may realize God's blessings before that.
[time=925] You may see the overcome of your difficulties and problems and illnesses whatever before that but you may not.
[time=935] Our ultimate hope is heaven.
[time=940] This morning I would just like to continue that thought by trying to paint for you a picture
[time=948] of what heaven is going to be like for you and for me.
[time=953] And by doing that perhaps help us in the day by day difficulties that we have to make through in this life.
[time=962] That's what heaven should be.
[time=963] We've been singing about the hope that God provides.
[time=966] That's what it should be for us, something that we look forward to.
[time=971] When I was in high school the first regular job I had was working in a restaurant, the Pied Piper restaurant in Pontiac, Michigan.
[time=978] Started there when I was in 10th grade and I ended up working there for over two years but I started out as a dishwasher which is not a very glamorous job and it's not very
[time=990] fun either.
[time=991] I stood at this little stainless steel window and waited for people to bring in buckets of dishes and glasses and silverware and I'd go through and take them out one by one and
[time=1002] spray all the crud off of them and stack them in a tray and push that tray into a unit and the sides would close down and you push the button and as they're being cleaned you're spraying off other dishes and then when those are done you lift up the side, you pull them out, you let them dry, you stack them and you take them out so they can be used again over and over and over again that was exciting for about the first night that I worked there and I came home and went to bed and as you know how jobs can be you know woke up all through the night sitting up in bed washing dishes going through the routine.
[time=1033] Well I would go to work a few times each week and learn to quickly not enjoy that aspect
[time=1040] of my job very much but there's something that kept me going.
[time=1046] It was sitting on my dresser at home.
[time=1050] It was a brochure and on the cover of that brochure it was a picture of a blue metallic Schwinn Continental 10 speed bike.
[time=1058] Now I'd never owned a good bike up into this time and I wanted that bike and I was going to save my money so I could buy that blue metallic Schwinn Continental 10 speed.
[time=1069] And even though I would get the call to come into work and there would be a sense of in me about going in and not wanting to do it I knew that by going to work three nights a week at the end of the week there would be a paycheck and after a season of paychecks I would have enough money to buy that bike and so it kept me going.
[time=1087] The hope for what was ahead and that's just a very small picture of what what heaven the
[time=1093] hope of heaven should be like when we have a good understanding of what God has prepared for us that should give us a sense of excitement and energy to make it through much of what
[time=1104] we have to deal with in this life.
[time=1107] So my what I want to do this morning is try to make the picture of heaven a little bit clearer for you.
[time=1114] So hopefully you can leave here with just a little bit better grasp of maybe what God has in store for us and I'll do that by trying to show you three pictures.
[time=1125] First of all a picture of your new home, secondly a picture of your new family and thirdly a picture of the new you which is a real exciting picture to look at.
[time=1135] If you have your Bibles turn to Revelation chapter one it's going to be the jumping off point for most of what we talk about this morning.
[time=1144] Revelation is of course the book written by John God gives John a vision of things that
[time=1152] were yet to come and he writes them down most of these things have still not occurred.
[time=1160] They are waiting for their fulfillment.
[time=1163] We come to chapter 21 and we see the recording of his vision regards to the new place that
[time=1170] God has prepared for his people.
[time=1174] Look at verses one and two.
[time=1177] Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away.
[time=1183] You know God is in the business of making things new.
[time=1186] In the lives of people he's in the business of redemption, of buying back, of making new,
[time=1192] taking something that was broken, something that stood under a curse, something that stood under the judgment of a holy God and he brings about healing, brings about forgiveness, brings
[time=1202] about newness.
[time=1203] He's going to do that with the rest of creation too.
[time=1205] Scripture tells us that all of creation groans and longs for the completion of God's salvation
[time=1212] because creation itself has been affected by the curse of sin and one day God is going
[time=1218] to come in and he's going to make it all new again.
[time=1223] And there was no longer any sea, verse two I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
[time=1233] The picture of your new home.
[time=1235] This is where you'll be living one day.
[time=1238] Jesus Christ gave us the promise when he left, he gave his disciples, he said, "I am going,
[time=1245] but in my father's house are many rooms and I'm going there to prepare a place for you." Well what's our new home going to look like?
[time=1253] What's this new place going to look like?
[time=1254] Look at this, look at this new heaven and new earth, look at this holy city that's talked about here.
[time=1260] Now again we're reading in the book of Revelation which is apocalyptic literature uses a lot
[time=1267] of imagery and symbolism and that's very obvious as we read through some of the other accounts in this book.
[time=1273] We come to chapter 21 and the question is, is this literally what things will look like or is this more imagery?
[time=1281] And it's hard to know for sure but let me just say that other passages of Scripture describe heaven, describe the new Jerusalem and paint it in very similar kinds of descriptions.
[time=1292] So it's very likely that this is exactly what God has prepared for us or at least as
[time=1298] well as John can describe it to us.
[time=1302] And first of all it talks about this holy city, this new Jerusalem, the city of God's people being like a bride coming to a groom as it comes out of the sky as John sees it.
[time=1316] Friday night I attended a wedding here in this auditorium.
[time=1320] Our five-year-old daughter was with us and as the bride made her way down our daughter was standing up on her seat trying to catch a glimpse of the bride.
[time=1328] And later on whispered to me she looks just like a princess because that's what a bride looks and all her beauty and the groom stands down there with his mouth open and his nervous ness and just is overcome by the beauty of the bride coming down and she's all dressed and that's what John, that's the words that he found to try to describe what it looked like the city, the city that had been prepared for Christ and for the people of Christ.
[time=1351] It's like the bride coming to meet the groom.
[time=1354] It's a beautiful place.
[time=1357] And if you look later on in this chapter beginning at verse 9 and on it goes on to give more descriptions about this city.
[time=1364] And it's almost as if John is fumbling for the right words so that we can get some understanding
[time=1370] of what the city looks like and he describes it in terms of pure gold.
[time=1373] In fact gold that is so pure that it's clear.
[time=1377] He describes it in terms of precious stones that shine.
[time=1380] It's as though this huge diamond is coming out of the sky shining in all its brilliance
[time=1386] and this is a city, this is the dwelling place for the people of God.
[time=1390] This is our home.
[time=1391] It's what it's going to look like.
[time=1396] Chapter goes on to describe this city as having huge wall that goes all around it.
[time=1401] It's a square wall, four sides and on each side of the wall are three gates.
[time=1405] Each gate is milled out of what appears to be one huge tremendous pearl.
[time=1412] So we get the term pearly gates and each gate has a name across it which is the name of one of the 12 tribes of Israel which shows the continuing importance of Israel and the people
[time=1422] of God.
[time=1423] And the foundation of the wall is made of 12 layers and each foundation under the wall
[time=1429] has the name of one of the apostles of Jesus Christ.
[time=1433] And here's this great wall that surrounds the city.
[time=1439] And the size of the city, well if I put it in terms of we understand, you look on a map and most maps show a comparative size of a city and some cities are little black dots
[time=1450] and some are larger black dots and some are little red dots and some are big red dots and you kind of get a feel for how large a city is.
[time=1457] You look at some cities like New York and Chicago and Los Angeles and they take up a little more space on the map.
[time=1462] Well if we mapped out this city, we would have to map out one side of this city being
[time=1468] from Canada to Florida.
[time=1471] That's one side of the squared city.
[time=1473] And the other side is the same distance, 1,400, 1,500 miles from side to side, squared.
[time=1482] Not only that but it says it is the same in its height.
[time=1487] And some scholars think that the city is going to be cubical and shaped, you know, levels
[time=1493] and levels and levels of apartments and rooms or whatever.
[time=1497] Others feel that well maybe it's not going to be a cube, maybe it's a four-sided pyramid.
[time=1501] We don't know for sure.
[time=1502] But it's this tremendous three-dimensional city that will house the people of God.
[time=1507] And if it is a cube shape, which most people think that this is referring to, the surface
[time=1513] area of this city is more than 15 times the current surface area of this earth, land or
[time=1519] sea.
[time=1520] So this place is huge.
[time=1521] That's just the outside.
[time=1522] There's the inside too.
[time=1523] The New Jerusalem.
[time=1524] It's beautiful, it's great, it's awesome.
[time=1529] And out of the city shines a light, it's the light of the presence of God, of the Father and of the land.
[time=1535] In fact it goes on in the chapter to tell us that there is no need for sun or moon, there's never any darkness because the light of God is constantly shining throughout the city.
[time=1545] There's a river of life that flows from the throne of God and on the sides of the river there is the tree of life.
[time=1551] Do you remember the tree of life, the Garden of Eden?
[time=1553] They were eat of the fruit they would live forever.
[time=1555] Well now the tree stands in the new city as the sign that we will live forever.
[time=1562] We will live eternally.
[time=1563] And the fruit of the tree is growing all year round, it never stops, it's always in
[time=1569] the season.
[time=1570] It's going to be a beautiful place, it's going to be a great place.
[time=1574] And as John describes it again, it almost seems like he's working, struggling to find
[time=1580] the right ways to describe it so that we can get some understanding.
[time=1583] But I would imagine what he saw, and what we imagine, when we read this, are probably
[time=1589] rather separated, probably difficult to really for us to understand the vision that he saw.
[time=1595] It's probably rather like if we were to take someone who had never had sight, had never
[time=1601] seen anything in other life, and try to help them understand what a rainbow is like.
[time=1607] How do you do that?
[time=1608] There's no reference point, or someone who has never heard a sound and try to help them
[time=1615] understand what harmony in music sounds like.
[time=1619] How do you do that?
[time=1621] And I would imagine it's the same kind of frustration that John would feel in trying to write this down for us.
[time=1626] The picture of your new home, what we can see is awesome, it's beautiful, it's something
[time=1634] to long for and to look forward to.
[time=1636] And yet our best imagination probably can't even come close to what reality will be.
[time=1642] And by the way, I don't think there's anything wrong with letting our imagination go and
[time=1648] thinking what the new home will be like, what our new lives will be like.
[time=1653] I think God has created in us a sense of imagination and creativity and desire for beauty that oftentimes comes out in the arts that is just preparation for all that he has prepared for us.
[time=1664] And that longing in us can stir us the thoughts and the imaginations of what it will be.
[time=1668] I think that's okay because the reality is going to be even better beyond that.
[time=1673] That's a picture of your new home.
[time=1675] Let's look at another picture, your new family.
[time=1677] And when I start saying this, I think it bothers Christians sometimes to think that our current
[time=1684] family structure is going to change, but the Bible says that it will.
[time=1688] Jesus was very clear in Luke chapter 20 when he was talking about what our relationships will be like in heaven.
[time=1694] And the one thing he stated for certain is that there will be no marriage in heaven.
[time=1698] There will be no husbands and wives in heaven.
[time=1701] Family relationships are going to be different.
[time=1703] And when I was a boy, this bothered me a lot, to be honest.
[time=1709] Because frankly, I didn't want Jesus to come back until after I was married.
[time=1713] I wanted to be able to enjoy that kind of relationship and that kind of closeness and that kind of romance and that kind of physical intimacy.
[time=1720] And I just thought, well, I'm sure heaven's going to be good, but God, please let me get married first so I can understand what that's all about.
[time=1726] Then you can come back if you want to.
[time=1728] And I think that's, I find that to be typical of a lot of people.
[time=1730] Or if you're enjoying a strong relationship now and you think about heaven and you think that that relationship is going to change, sometimes that's not, we're not always encouraged
[time=1742] by that.
[time=1743] We're troubled by it.
[time=1745] But I would liken it to this.
[time=1746] Imagine we brought a five-year-old boy up here on this stage.
[time=1750] And then I held up to the boy, two things.
[time=1754] One thing, first thing I showed him would be a huge bag of candy.
[time=1758] And the second thing I showed the boy was a beautiful woman.
[time=1762] And the choice is given to the boy now, you can have either one of these, you can have this bag of candy, or you can have this woman who is beautiful and created for relationship and love and romance and intimacy, which would you like to have?
[time=1775] Well, I'll guarantee you, any normal five-year-old is going to grab the bag of candy and run.
[time=1779] I mean, who wants a beautiful woman, I mean, kudis and all that sort of stuff.
[time=1783] They don't understand.
[time=1785] Now, little boys grow up, and I would think that by the time he's a teenager and older and an adult, you give the same choice and the selection's a little more difficult to
[time=1796] make.
[time=1797] But I think it's the same thing.
[time=1799] Now if God stands us up here on the stage and brings alongside of you, there's someone
[time=1805] that you have a close relationship to, someone that you love, perhaps a husband or wife, and says to you, now, you have a choice.
[time=1812] I mean, what would you rather have, a forever relationship married to this person, and even
[time=1818] that marriage will be perfected, but you will have the closeness, you will have the love, you will have the intimacy of that relationship, or where'd you rather have the relationships that I've got prepared like in heaven?
[time=1829] Well, to be honest, I guess, feeling-wise, we want to hold on to what we know is good
[time=1835] to us.
[time=1837] But in the same way that the boy could understand the awesomeness of relational intimacy with
[time=1843] someone because of his own immaturity, in the same way I think our immaturity leads us to conclusions and desires that are just off base, because heaven is going to be so much better and different than any relationship we can experience here on earth.
[time=1857] So the picture of the new family in heaven is going to be different.
[time=1860] First of all, scripture tells us that big part of that picture is going to be the person of God himself.
[time=1866] God, the Father, Jesus Christ, we will be with them.
[time=1871] We will be in their presence.
[time=1872] We will stand with Christ.
[time=1873] We will see Him face to face.
[time=1876] Remember the song a number of years ago that was popular and had a phrase in that God is
[time=1882] watching us from a distance?
[time=1884] Remember that song?
[time=1885] And every time I heard that phrase, it bothered me because I said, you know, God isn't watching us from a distance.
[time=1890] It's not like God is up in heaven peeking through a little peephole way far away and just every now and then looking and seeing how we're doing, because God is here with us.
[time=1900] God is everywhere, but uniquely in the life of a Christian, His Spirit lives in us.
[time=1906] But at the same time, I would say, and I think you would have to admit, that there is a distance between us and God, there is a real way in which we are still separated from closeness
[time=1917] with Him.
[time=1918] I mean, even those men and women of scripture who we would look at is especially close to God, having a strong relationship with God.
[time=1924] And they, you know, had to be somewhat removed from the presence of God, couldn't stand that.
[time=1930] And that's because of our sinfulness and our imperfections.
[time=1933] But there's coming a day when all that wall between us and God will be torn aside and we will stand face to face with Jesus Christ.
[time=1942] We will stand in the presence of the glory of God.
[time=1946] And that's going to be a wonderful thing.
[time=1948] And that has much to do with the value of heaven.
[time=1953] Larry Wilhite is a teacher here in our school, and also works on staff with our youth ministries
[time=1959] here at Black Hawk.
[time=1961] And a number of years ago, he wrote down an experience of a conversation that he had with
[time=1968] his three-year-old nephew, Michael.
[time=1971] And something of what that conversation taught him about heaven.
[time=1977] Michael lived out of state and called his Uncle Larry one day.
[time=1980] And this is in Larry's words, his account of what took place.
[time=1986] Uncle Larry, I miss you so much.
[time=1988] I wish I could be with you and your apartment all day.
[time=1992] I answered, well, maybe someday you'll be able to do that.
[time=1996] Michael responded, well, I think that when we die, we'll just stay at your apartment forever.
[time=2001] Well, I was quick to correct the theological error with, well, I think when we die that we'll be in heaven, but we'll be together, so that's all right.
[time=2010] I've loved telling this story over and over because it is cute, and it is about someone's love for me.
[time=2016] I've also thought about it considerably.
[time=2018] My first thoughts of correcting his error had to do with my expectation that heaven will indeed be a far nicer place than my current home.
[time=2026] This apartment is not very spacious.
[time=2028] This carpet is old, ugly, stained.
[time=2031] The drapes are rotting away, and they do little to keep out the sunlight.
[time=2034] From time to time, the roof leaks.
[time=2036] Most of my furniture is old, and it shows its age.
[time=2039] I certainly didn't see what appeal this place had for Michael.
[time=2043] When he and his family stayed here recently for several days, he didn't have room to run or toys to play with, and since I'm single, there are more things to be careful not to touch around my apartment.
[time=2055] I would have thought that this would be on his top 10 list of least favorite places to spend the day to let alone eternity, but at last I thought, I think I realized why he
[time=2066] sees my humble home as a paradise.
[time=2068] It's because he loves me, and I live in this place.
[time=2074] Not enough room?
[time=2075] Who cares?
[time=2076] No toys?
[time=2077] Who needs them?
[time=2078] Uncle Larry, one that he loves deeply, lives here.
[time=2081] Once again, I am taught a theological truth by a three-year-old.
[time=2085] Most of our discussions about heaven concerned the setting or conjectures of how we will get to amuse and enjoy ourselves, or who from earth we will be able to see and talk with.
[time=2094] Yes, the Bible says the streets of heaven are paved with gold and the pearls and jewels abound, but will we even really notice these things all that much?
[time=2104] Will we even care that much about our surroundings?
[time=2107] After all, Jesus Christ, the one that we love, will be there, and I believe that's true.
[time=2113] I think when we have the beatific vision, when we are face-to-face with Christ, everything
[time=2119] else, even the awesomeness of this holy place that he has prepared for us will pail in comparison
[time=2126] to who he is and the longings of our hearts that will be fulfilled just being with him.
[time=2132] That's part of the picture of your new family.
[time=2134] There's more to it too, because part of your new family will be the perfected saints, and I put the emphasis on perfected, because we live with brothers and sisters in Christ here on earth, but we're not perfected.
[time=2145] I mean, we still deal in sin, even in our best efforts, we oftentimes act selfishly, and even when we don't intend, we act in ways that hurt one another, and yet we'll live with
[time=2156] brothers and sisters in Christ without any of those things that hinder our relationships here on earth.
[time=2161] No sin will interfere.
[time=2163] It will be perfect love and perfect giving and perfect communion and perfect relationship in heaven.
[time=2169] Everything we would want and desire and what God created us to be for one another, we will enjoy in heaven, and we will also live with the heavenly beings.
[time=2178] The Bible describes some of the beings' angels and the like, but I don't even know if God
[time=2185] tells us everything about the creatures he's created.
[time=2189] There may be more that he hasn't even described to us, and we'll live with them.
[time=2192] It's a picture of your new family.
[time=2194] Now let me talk about a picture of the new you.
[time=2198] What are you going to be like?
[time=2201] Revelation 21 verse 4 says, "He will wipe every tear from their eyes.
[time=2205] There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things
[time=2211] has passed away." Things are going to be different even as far as who you are and your body is concerned.
[time=2219] The Bible promises us that in the next life, our bodies will be resurrected and made new,
[time=2226] and we will have bodies that are called heavenly bodies, spiritual bodies.
[time=2229] They will be bodies like Christ's body was after he rose from the dead.
[time=2235] Here's what it says in Philippians chapter 3, it says, "Our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that
[time=2245] enables him to bring everything under his control," listen to this, "he will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be made like his glorious body." There are some things I know about what our bodies are going to be like in heaven.
[time=2258] There are some things that the Bible does tell us.
[time=2261] First of all, it will not be a ghost.
[time=2262] They're not these bodies that are ghostly spirit things that have no substance to them.
[time=2267] When Jesus came back from the dead, he appeared to his disciples and he said, "Come, touch
[time=2273] me." See, a ghost doesn't have flesh and blood like I have.
[time=2278] His body had substance to it, but it's going to be different.
[time=2282] It's going to be what 1 Corinthians 15 calls a heavenly body, a spiritual body, much different
[time=2289] than the one we possess now.
[time=2293] We in our life here on earth possess both the material and the immaterial.
[time=2298] We have physical bodies, but we also have that part of us that is not physical, that spirit, that heart of who you and I are.
[time=2306] In heaven, we will still have both.
[time=2308] When we are given our new bodies, we will still have spirit and we will still have bodies.
[time=2313] But the relationship between the two is different and maybe I can describe it or at least illustrate it, try to this way.
[time=2318] Let this white glove represent that immaterial part of us.
[time=2321] It represents your spirit, that person of who you really are, and let my hand represent
[time=2328] our physical bodies.
[time=2330] It's this biological thing that keeps us going, that we live in, that makes up your characteristics, who you look like, your health, your lack of health, the shell that we wear around us.
[time=2342] This is our body.
[time=2343] In this life, there's a relationship between the two.
[time=2346] When you look at me, you're not looking just at a shell and you're not looking at spirit, you're looking at a combination of the two and it makes me who I am and it makes you who you are.
[time=2357] But the spirit is limited in a lot of ways governed by the limitations of our physical
[time=2363] body.
[time=2364] We are limited by time and space, we suffer pain, we grow old, we die.
[time=2369] And eventually there will come a time that this body will waste away, it will be laid
[time=2375] into a ground, the shell of who we are is buried, our spirit goes to be with God but the promise
[time=2381] of Scripture is that this body, we're going to be giving a new recreated body that will be joined with our spirit again.
[time=2387] But the relationship will be different because in heaven, no longer will the spirit be subjugated
[time=2394] to the body but in heaven, the spirit is that part that is in more control.
[time=2401] Our bodies are no longer limited by the confines of time and space and disease and age but
[time=2407] they are spiritual bodies, heavenly bodies, it says that we are clothed with immortality.
[time=2414] So there's a different relationship.
[time=2418] What you will be like and what you will be able to do with this new spiritual body is so much different than what you are like and what you're able to do here on earth.
[time=2428] For instance, it says that this body will be eternal.
[time=2431] It will be glorious, it will be powerful, it will never die, it will never know disease,
[time=2437] it will never know sickness, it will never know pain, I'm thankful for that.
[time=2442] This past week I learned to barefoot waterski, at least the first steps in that.
[time=2448] And to do that, I don't know if you've ever seen someone do that or learning to do that, I was on off the side of a ski boat and there was a beam that was attached to the middle of the ski boat and I was holding on to this beam, I was in a wetsuit and the boat took off going 36 miles an hour and I'm just bouncing around laying on the water.
[time=2466] Now I thought before I learned to do this that the part of me that would be hurting when I got done was the bottom of my feet but I want to tell you that about everything else did hurt, the bottom of my feet were fine but I was bouncing all over me, this is almost like soft concrete you're bouncing on and then turning my body around and eventually standing up on my feet but I want to tell you later that afternoon the next morning I was sore, didn't feel like doing any more barefoot skiing for the rest of that trip.
[time=2494] You know in heaven, I could barefoot waterski as much as I want, I'd never be sore.
[time=2498] I don't even know if I'll need a boat in heaven, but I'll be able to do that as much as I want, no tiredness the next day, no soreness, no bruises, it's going to be a powerful
[time=2507] eternal body.
[time=2511] Scripture tells us that in this body we will be able to eat, when Jesus appeared in His disciples he ate with them, but it also tells us that we won't feel the pain of hunger or the need to eat, the requirement to eat, we'll just be able to eat because we enjoy eating.
[time=2527] That's good news for some of you isn't it?
[time=2531] And I don't know what all that means, I don't think we'll sit around eternity gorging ourselves on everything, but I think we'll be able to enjoy the good things that God will have prepared for us to feast on and to drink.
[time=2541] Not because we need to, but because we want to and there's the pleasure that God gives us in that.
[time=2547] Bible tells us that this body will have substance to it, it can be felt, it's not a ghost and
[time=2553] yet it is not confined to the limits of this earthly body, Jesus was able to walk through a wall to get to where the disciples were.
[time=2560] They were in this room and all of a sudden Jesus was through the wall and appeared there with Him.
[time=2567] And the way that we'll be able to travel in this body, this is one of my favorite parts.
[time=2571] I mean Jesus after His resurrection he walked, remember the guys on the road to Emmaus, he walked alongside of them and talked with them, so I mean if you want to walk you'll be able to do that, I think if you want to run you'll be able to do that.
[time=2582] But then as he sat down at the table with them and he broke the bread it says that he left, he was gone, he didn't go out the door, he just, I mean the bread dropped and Jesus was somewhere else.
[time=2593] This body will have the ability to just move from one place to another at thought.
[time=2601] I've already told you this I think, but that's how you can go if you want to.
[time=2606] You can move around that way if you want to.
[time=2608] I already know how I'm getting around in heaven and the rest of creation, at least for a large part of the time, because I've always dreamed of flying like Superman.
[time=2618] So I'm going to be getting around more like when Jesus went up into the sky, he didn't just blink out, he ran, he went up and that's how I wanted to get around.
[time=2628] I just want to put my hands out, jump up and go from place to place, maybe plan it to plan it, I don't know.
[time=2634] But that's how I want to travel at least for part of the time and eternity.
[time=2636] But I'm going to be able to do that because of this new heavenly spiritual body.
[time=2641] I mean that is great.
[time=2645] Are we going to recognize each other, are we all going to look the same, are we all going to look like Jesus, or what?
[time=2652] And the Bible doesn't tell us a whole lot about this, but it does give strong indication that we will still be individuals who are recognizable to one another.
[time=2660] Now I don't know if we'll be recognizable because of our physical characteristics, or God will just give us the ability to know who one another are.
[time=2667] But in Scripture it gives us some idea of this, remember the Mount of Transfiguration when three of the disciples were standing with Jesus and Moses and Elijah came down?
[time=2676] It says that they recognize them.
[time=2679] Now they never saw pictures of Moses and Elijah, so I'm not sure how they knew, but they knew.
[time=2683] And they knew them as individuals, they knew them as distinct from one another.
[time=2688] Jesus tells us that heaven will be able to feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will know who they are.
[time=2694] When Jesus told the story of Lazarus and the rich man, after their death, in the story there was a recognition of persons of who one another would be.
[time=2704] I think that's going to be true in heaven.
[time=2706] We will know one another, and we'll even know the people that we haven't met before, but are the believers in heaven.
[time=2711] There will be that recognition.
[time=2712] And my guess is, and this is just a guess, it's a thought, but my guess is that our appearance will be rather ageless.
[time=2718] I don't think that if someone dies as a child, they're going to be a little child walking around to heaven, or someone dies as someone who's elderly, that they'll have an older body in heaven.
[time=2725] I think there will be an agelessness about us because time doesn't mean anything there, and yet we'll know one another.
[time=2731] And people say, "Well, what are we going to do?" And as a kid, this bothered me to.
[time=2734] I mean, I thought, I know it's supposed to be a spiritual thing to sing praises and worship
[time=2740] all the time, but the thought of eternity standing around just singing all the time didn't sound very exciting to me.
[time=2745] And I think we're going to have lots of opportunity to praise and worship and sing, and I think around the throne of God, singing and worship will constantly be going on as it is now.
[time=2753] And I think that individually you and I will have times of doing other things as well.
[time=2757] Revelation 22 verses 3 through 5 just gives us some broad idea of our responsibilities,
[time=2763] what we might be doing, says no longer will there be any curse, the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in the city, and a servants will serve Him.
[time=2771] We will be serving God.
[time=2772] Now, doing what?
[time=2774] I'm not sure.
[time=2776] Maybe much in the same way that the angels are currently serving God as they administer through much of God's creation, God's going to give us responsibilities to serve Him in the new creation that He has made.
[time=2788] Goes on to say, verse 4, "They will see His face and His name will be on their foreheads, there will be no more night, they will not need the light of the lamp or the light of the sun for the Lord God will give them light, and they will reign forever and ever.
[time=2801] We will serve and we will rule." Now, how we will serve and what or who we will rule, I'm not really sure.
[time=2808] Scripture says that we will judge angels, those are probably the fallen angels.
[time=2812] Will we rule over angels?
[time=2813] Will we rule over other parts of God's creation?
[time=2815] Will God be creating new lives or new places that we will be responsible for?
[time=2820] I don't know.
[time=2821] I think the creation of God is limitless.
[time=2822] I think it's rather proud for us to assume that all that we see and know around us in
[time=2828] our world, in our solar system, in our galaxy, in our universe is all that God's ever going to do.
[time=2834] I mean, God can do whatever He wants.
[time=2835] He can create a billion more universes if He wants to.
[time=2838] We can do things in ways that we can't even imagine now, and we'll be able to serve and reign in some capacities in those new creations of God.
[time=2847] It's going to be great.
[time=2848] It's going to be wonderful.
[time=2851] Scripture also tells us in Luke 19 that our reigning will be at different levels.
[time=2854] There will be different levels of service and rule based much on how we've been useful
[time=2861] to God, how we've served Him in this life, but there will never be a sense of, "Oh, I'm a low man on the totem pole," or, "So-and-so got the better job than me," we'll all serve
[time=2870] in perfect joy and gratefulness to God.
[time=2874] Those are some of the pictures, picture of your new home, picture of your new family, picture of a new you.
[time=2880] Let me just look at a few verses in closing here, back to Revelation 21.
[time=2884] Look at verse 5, "He who was seated on the throne said, 'I am making everything new,' and he said, 'Write this down for these words are trustworthy and true.'"
[time=2895] As Christians, sometimes we're criticized for not dealing with reality.
[time=2900] And sometimes this whole issue of heaven is looked at as wishful thinking on our part, some kind of dream that we conjure up because we can't deal with the realities of life, so we escape into this thought of heaven.
[time=2913] Well, that's partly true, heaven does help us cope with the difficulties of this life,
[time=2923] and it should.
[time=2924] That can be a comfort to us, much in the same way that when I'm dealing with physical pain and discomfort, I will go to a doctor and say, "Is there anything you can give me that can help me ease the pain of this?" Well, heaven helps ease the pain of this life and this world, but it's not just wishful
[time=2939] thinking, it's not just fantasy.
[time=2944] Jesus said to his disciples, "You believe in God, you believe also in me.
[time=2949] In my father's house, for many rooms, I go to prepare a place for you," and he said, "If it were not so, I would have told you.
[time=2956] I'm not making this up.
[time=2958] I'm not just trying to paint this imaginary picture just so you have something hopeful that you can hang on to, even though it's not really true." Jesus said, "Listen, if that wasn't the truth, I'd tell you it's not the truth, but it is true and you can trust on it." And the voice from the throne says, "Write this down, this is trustworthy and it's true." And it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not, God says it's the truth and these things are going to be reality to us one day as Christians.
[time=2988] We can count on it.
[time=2990] I went to a short trip down Cincinnati a couple of weeks ago with my daughter and niece, made
[time=2998] reservations in a motel down there as I went in and said, "Well, we don't have you down for reservations." I said, "Well, here's the name, the person I talked to, here's my confirmation number." They looked at my confirmation number and said, "Well, that is a confirmation number.
[time=3011] We got someone else's name there.
[time=3012] They didn't have my room." We're never going to get to heaven and experience a computer glitch in God's computer.
[time=3019] You guys say, "Oh," and we're saying, "Well, God, I should be here," and he's like, "Well, I'm not sure.
[time=3024] Maybe we lost that reservation." You guys promised it, it's true.
[time=3029] We can count on it if we belong to him.
[time=3032] Now, unfortunately, not everyone is going to make it there.
[time=3035] In fact, scripture says that most people, most people will not make it to heaven.
[time=3041] Says narrow is the gate and narrow is the road that leads to eternal life.
[time=3045] Why it is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction?
[time=3050] Most people will face a different eternity.
[time=3053] The interesting thing is, Gallup poll conducted a survey a few years back asking Americans about their beliefs in heaven and hell, and even among the people that didn't associate themselves with any religion or church, even among those people, 61 percent of them thought they'd probably make it to heaven, and only 9 percent thought they'd end up at a place like hell.
[time=3074] Yet scripture says that most of us, most of the people on this earth will realize that
[time=3080] destiny, and verse eight in chapter 21 says that it is the law breakers that will end
[time=3086] up there.
[time=3087] Those who have violated the commands and laws of God will face his judgment.
[time=3091] And it doesn't matter if you are better than other people.
[time=3094] James tells us that if you've broken God's law on just even one point, you're guilty of breaking all of it.
[time=3099] You are a law breaker and you will face the judgment of God.
[time=3103] And hell is a real place.
[time=3104] The Bible talks about it over and over again.
[time=3106] It gives these descriptions of it.
[time=3107] It says it's outer darkness, a lake of fire, a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth, eternal torment, eternal punishment, eternal separation from God's blessing.
[time=3118] And the worst imaginable suffering we could imagine in this life cannot match the suffering
[time=3125] that's described in the Bible, and the description of scripture likely can't even match the reality of the suffering of hell.
[time=3133] And people say, "Well, how could a God who loves do such a thing?" Because they forget that God is a God of holiness and justice.
[time=3144] And yet he is a God of love and mercy.
[time=3146] See in chapter 20, it says verse 15, "Anyone whose name was not found written in the book
[time=3153] of life he was thrown into the lake of fire." There is a thing called the book of life.
[time=3158] There is a person called Christ who was the Lamb of God who died as a sacrifice for our sin.
[time=3165] Anyone who trusts in him as the one who took God's judgment for their sin has the promise
[time=3173] that God will take them and wipe away every wrongdoing, every sin, every fault, and take
[time=3180] the righteousness that Jesus Christ possessed and credit it to their life so that when we stand before the throne of God, our name is written in the book of life and he sees us as righteous, as forgiven, as right.
[time=3193] For him, that's a promise.
[time=3195] That's the hope for everyone.
[time=3200] You may be here this morning and you don't have that assurance.
[time=3204] You don't have that certainty in your life.
[time=3208] What Scripture says you need to do is simply realize that Jesus Christ did what only Jesus
[time=3214] Christ could do in living a sinless life and taking God's judgment on himself as the replacement,
[time=3220] as the sacrifice for you so that you don't have to take the judgment of God.
[time=3226] If you will commit your life to him believing in who he is and what he's done and you give your life to him, the Bible says you become a child of God.
[time=3235] You are a Christian and all these pictures that we've laid out this morning, that's your future.
[time=3240] That's the promise of God.
[time=3243] Let me conclude just by looking at two verses here, verses six and seven, and let this just
[time=3253] be kind of a final encouragement to those of you who are trusting in Christ.
[time=3258] He said to me, "It is done.
[time=3261] I'm the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.
[time=3264] To him who is thirsty, I will give to drink without cost from the spring of water of life.
[time=3269] And he who overcomes will inherit all this and I will be his God and he will be my son."
[time=3277] If you are like me too often, you get caught up in the routines of this life and we forget what God has prepared for us.
[time=3284] There is a saying that there are some people that are accused of being so heavenly minded that they are no earthly good and that is true of some people.
[time=3292] We are so caught up in the religion and thoughts of God that we fail to live out our responsibilities
[time=3299] to others here on earth.
[time=3302] I would imagine that probably what more of us struggle against is being so earthly minded that we are no heavenly good.
[time=3308] We are focused so much on the concerns and the difficulties and the goals and desires of this earth.
[time=3313] Christ said, "Set your affection on things above.
[time=3317] Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven.
[time=3320] We should have the perspective eternity, the hope for heaven." That should be the picture that sits on our dresser so as we work through the routines of this life, that is what we are waiting for.
[time=3329] That is what we are investing in.
[time=3331] That is what is coming.
[time=3334] We think about standing before Christ face to face, man that is a wonderful thing.
[time=3339] One afternoon a man named Grant Tuller went to eat a quick supper at the home of a pastor and his wife.
[time=3344] There were religious revival services happening in this pastor's church and so they were eating a quick meal before they were going to head off to the revival services and in the rush to get the supper on the table, someone failed to fill up the jelly dish.
[time=3358] There is only one small bite left in the jelly dish and the pastor and his wife knew that Tuller liked jelly so they both refused eating it and they passed instead the dish to him and Tuller remarked as he took the jelly dish, "So this is all for me, is it?" As soon as he said those words, the words somehow kept playing in his mind, "So this is all for me, is it?" this is all for me, is it?
[time=3379] All for me.
[time=3381] And those words all for me stuck in his mind and he stood up from the table and went over to the piano and began hammering out a tune that fit with this all for me.
[time=3391] He started playing and he started putting words verses to the song and it was soon time for them to head to the service.
[time=3397] Later he came back that night and laid out a few verses of the song all for me and as he went to bed he told the pastor and his wife, "Tomorrow when I get up I'll work some more on this." Well he never did because the next morning the postman brought to him a letter from a woman named Mrs. Beck and inside this letter were a series of poems and as he took the first poem and read it he realized that that poem fit exactly with the tune that he had written.
[time=3421] Not one word of the poem, not one note of the tune had to be changed and so he set aside
[time=3427] his own words and used the words of Mrs. Beck to create this song that I can remember singing
[time=3433] in church services in my past, in revival services, in camp meetings and it talks about
[time=3440] the wonder of seeing Jesus face to face and it goes like this, face to face with Christ
[time=3447] my Savior, face to face what will it be, when with rapture I behold him Jesus Christ
[time=3468] to die for me.
