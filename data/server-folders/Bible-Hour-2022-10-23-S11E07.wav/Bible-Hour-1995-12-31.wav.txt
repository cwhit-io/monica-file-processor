[time=61] - This is the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=64] Thank you for joining us.
[time=66] Who is Jesus Christ?
[time=67] Some say a great teacher.
[time=69] Others say a great prophet.
[time=70] Stay with us today and find out who God the Father said he was.
[time=75] Now let's join our service.

[time=304] (piano music) - Well, hi, my name's Russell Moore, and I want to welcome you to the Bible hour, and thank you for joining us again today.
[time=314] You know, I was just the other day speaking with someone in our church, and they are undergoing some very, very difficult circumstances in their life.
[time=322] One of the family members has cancer, and they're not sure how to respond to that, and what to do about that.
[time=329] It may, of course, take this person's life.
[time=332] I'm not sure, can't be sure.
[time=334] But as I was sitting there talking to the husband and the father, he was just reflecting on how meaningful this holiday season was to him
[time=344] in light of that cancer.
[time=346] How throughout the Christmas story, hearing an over and over again and enjoying the whole spirit of Christmas and the person of Christ coming to be the Savior, it took on a whole new dimension, and he indicated how no Christmas had ever been as meaningful before.
[time=363] And I guess sometimes God brings difficulty into our lives.
[time=367] He changes the circumstances of our lives, and begins to take a different course than we would have considered picturesque or perfect or the way we would like our life to go.
[time=377] He does that in order to highlight the wonder and the beauty of his son and to bring us to a place where we can appreciate him in new ways, appreciate him as he ought to be appreciated.
[time=387] And we're studying the Book of Matthew together in this little series entitled "G.I." I wish I knew that.
[time=393] And of course, the whole Book of Matthew is designed to lift up the person of Jesus Christ as the true king of kings.
[time=401] And as we study through this, it's my prayer that God would open your eyes and your heart and your understanding to a deeper appreciation to the person of Jesus Christ and all that he is and all that he means to us.
[time=412] I know that he's doing that in my life.
[time=415] And it's wonderful to think about how Matthew is doing that, first by opening up the reality of Christ's claim to the throne of David, how he has the perfect genealogy which leads him back to the throne of David
[time=429] and how then he has claimed the throne of Israel because of that.
[time=434] And how then to see Christ being born of a virgin, what an unbelievable miracle that God created, conceiving his son there in the womb of Mary by the very miracle of the Holy Spirit.
[time=445] And then to see how Christ fulfills Old Testament prophecies, four of them, all related to geographical locations at the time of his birth, something he had absolutely no control over.
[time=456] And then today we'll move ahead in our study and understand how Christ is proclaimed to be the Son of God, the Savior of the world by an audible voice which comes from heaven itself, even the voice of God.
[time=468] So we seek to understand and appreciate the person of Jesus Christ.
