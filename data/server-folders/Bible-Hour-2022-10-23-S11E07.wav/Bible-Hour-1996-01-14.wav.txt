[time=61] - This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=64] Thank you for joining us.
[time=66] Can you imagine how hard it would be to live your life in the dark?
[time=69] No sun, no light, just the darkness.
[time=72] Think of how limiting that would be.
[time=74] The Bible compares living life without Christ to living life in the darkness.
[time=78] Stay with us today as we see how Christ came to free people from the bondage of darkness.
[time=83] Now let's join our service.
[time=85] (upbeat music) (dramatic music)
[time=93] [MUSIC - 228 seconds]
[time=326] - Hi, my name's Russell Moore,
[time=338] and I wanna welcome you to the Bible Hour, and thank you for joining us again today.
[time=342] Well, I'm excited about the time we get to share today in and around God's Word.
[time=347] The Bible has a lot of wonderful metaphors that help us get our hands and our minds around spiritual truth.
[time=354] And I'm so thankful that God doesn't just give theology in one sentence statements, and we have to kind of figure it out on our own.
[time=361] He gives us word pictures and stories and metaphors.
[time=364] And one of the most powerful metaphors that he gives us to describe the condition of people who don't know Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior is that of darkness.
[time=375] And as you know, when you're in the dark, you can't see, you can't choose your path, you stumble into things, you hit things, and it's a very difficult place to be, and could you imagine living your entire life in the darkness?
[time=388] And the picture that God paints is that of Jesus Christ coming as a powerful sunrise that brings light and exposes sin and allows people to repent and come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ and begin to live their life walking in the light of the person of Jesus Christ, his ministry, his principles, his priorities and his perspective.
[time=409] And so I trust you'll enjoy this today and you'll gain a new sense and understanding of an appreciation for the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=419] I also want to invite you to come to church today.
[time=421] Those of you who are watching this January 21, Sunday morning, you still have time to come to church today at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=430] Maybe it's been a while since you've come to church.
[time=432] Maybe you stopped going because the services were so routine and so traditional, they failed to engage your heart and your mind and your spirit.
[time=439] Well, I invite you to come today.
[time=441] We have a service format that I think will draw you in to thinking about God in some creative ways.
[time=447] So come and visit us today at 9.15 or 10.45.
[time=452] - You know, I've made some bad choices, just really bad choices.
[time=460] I guess I let myself believe that because, well, it's less painful than thinking, I can't do anything right.
[time=469] You see, I never really had a true friend growing up.
[time=473] My parents were always so busy or too tired and I was a talkative kid, still am I guess.
[time=482] I never really had a single person that I could talk to,
[time=488] somebody I could share with.
[time=491] Well, you know what I mean.
[time=493] I guess that's why, well, when I was a teenager, I started playing around with the guys.
[time=502] Even they never really listened to me, but at least they like being with me for a while anyway.
[time=511] I was about 17 and my mother clued in
[time=517] as to what my social life really was.
[time=519] Boy, did she chew me out.
[time=522] Wow, but then she ignored me even more than before.
[time=527] So I just left.
[time=530] Well, I moved in with this foreign guy.
[time=535] He must have been about 10 years older than I was.
[time=538] Oh, he seemed so mysterious.
[time=541] You know, I hardly understood anything he said, but we got married anyway at his temple.
[time=547] Boy, did I get the guilty's about that.
[time=550] Wow.
[time=552] I never bothered telling my family because I knew if I did, my father would show up and stop the wedding.
[time=558] Well, that was a good thing.
[time=561] I never did bother telling them because by the time my family and I were talking again, that guy and I had already split up.
[time=569] Then I married another one, just like him.
[time=574] I seemed to attract guys like that.
[time=583] It's almost as if I'm afraid to meet somebody who might actually want to talk to me.
[time=587] Like maybe he's gonna find out, well, there's nothing great about me, so he'll leave.
[time=592] Maybe there is something safe about not talking.
[time=597] Let's see.
[time=601] Yeah, I got married and divorced three more times.
[time=604] Still looking for somebody to talk to.
[time=606] It was kind of getting to be a habit.
[time=611] I was hurting so much inside, but I'd marry anyway.
[time=615] I was so lonely.
[time=617] And I think, well, maybe this time things will change.
[time=623] Maybe this time things will be different.
[time=626] Well, then after a few months, we'd be living our separate lives and pretty soon he'd be gone too.
[time=635] You think I'd learn.
[time=640] Well, I'm living with number six now.
[time=643] I figure my reputation is shot for life.
[time=645] So why even bother marrying the guy?
[time=647] Just live with him for a while until he gets his fill and then he'll be gone too.
[time=651] Well, at least I won't be so lonely.
[time=657] Oh, say, you know, I'm not an interesting guy over at Jakes.
[time=664] I was over there today and you know, that cafe around the corner?
[time=671] Well, it was so cold.
[time=673] Well, you know how cold it's been lately.
[time=675] I just had to stop in and get warmed.
[time=678] I guess it was more thirsty than I thought because I drank a couple glasses of water before I even sat down.
[time=684] Well, Alice got me a third glass and I went over to the stool by the window, sat down.
[time=691] And pretty soon, in walks this foreign guy
[time=697] and he sits down on his stool right next to mine.
[time=700] He looked so exhausted.
[time=703] Pretty soon he turns and he asks for a drink of my water.
[time=710] I don't know about you, but I generally don't let strangers drink from my glass.
[time=717] So I said, are you sure you want to drink after me?
[time=722] I mean, you don't even know me.
[time=726] And then he said, if you knew me, you would ask me for some water and I would gladly give it to you.
[time=735] Oh, am I okay?
[time=739] He takes a drink, a long drink and then he smiles.
[time=748] Oh no, it wasn't a come on type of smile.
[time=751] No, it was a warm, genuine, and friendly smile.
[time=756] , drinking this won't quench your thirst.
[time=761] But if you drink my water, you'll never thirst again.
[time=768] His water?
[time=771] I'm thinking, what's this guy talking about his water?
[time=774] So I play along.
[time=775] Okay, that sounds great.
[time=778] Would you do me a favor and sell me a bottle of this water so I can quit coming to this hole in the wall?
[time=786] Then he looks at me.
[time=789] It's almost as if his eyes are looking right through me and he gets a real concerned look on his face and says, where's your husband?
[time=801] Does he know your hair?
[time=804] Well, why don't you go get him and ask him to join us?
[time=808] Whoa, wait a minute.
[time=809] Man, I really got the guilty's then.
[time=813] So I told him I wasn't married.
[time=815] Now, I wasn't looking for a pickup.
[time=817] No, that's not it.
[time=818] I never really even felt he wanted me that way at all.
[time=822] It's just that, well, he just wanted to talk.
[time=826] I couldn't very well lie, but I couldn't tell him the whole truth either.
[time=834] You're not married, but you've been married before.
[time=842] Five times, isn't it?
[time=846] And the man you're living with right now is not your husband, so you're not married.
[time=851] Wait a minute.
[time=855] How did you know that?
[time=856] Are you some kind of mind reader?
[time=858] Do you have ESP?
[time=860] No, wait, are you some kind of prophet?
[time=865] Oh, I get it.
[time=866] You were talking religion.
[time=868] That water discussion we had, yeah, I know.
[time=872] Never get thirsty again.
[time=875] Look, I don't go to church.
[time=878] I mean, I pray sometimes, but well, I'm just not the right type.
[time=883] I'm just not the church type.
[time=886] So you know what he says to me?
[time=890] He says, believe me, there's a day coming when all who will believe will be the church type, the right type.
[time=903] Not because they're good enough, but because they know God has made a difference in their lives, the church type.
[time=911] There are a lot of imperfect people in church.
[time=916] They're there because they love each other, simply because they're thankful to God for loving them first.
[time=924] He said, don't try to be good enough 'cause you'll never be good enough.
[time=931] Just believe in me and then you'll be right with God.
[time=935] Well, just then, in walks these guys
[time=942] and they're staring at us.
[time=945] It's obvious that they're with him and they look like they're ready to leave.
[time=950] He just sat there.
[time=951] He wasn't in any hurry.
[time=953] He looked like he could have talked all day.
[time=956] They're over there right now.
[time=961] Say, would you like to go over and meet him?
[time=965] Gosh, you know, I think you would really like this guy.
[time=968] I felt like I've known him and he's known me all my life.
[time=973] But we don't have to stay long.
[time=976] Listen, I'm heading over there right now.
[time=979] Would you like to join me?
[time=980] I don't know how much longer he's gonna be there and well, let's see, it's getting late.
[time=987] So we could just stay an hour, okay?
[time=990] Well, what do you say?
[time=991] What do you say?
[time=995] [MUSIC - 243 seconds]
[time=1241] - Let me invite you to take your Bibles and come to Matthew chapter four where we can together look at this wonderful passage that in some ways introduces and gives an overview of the entire ministry of our Lord.
[time=1260] Matthew chapter four verse 16
[time=1267] says the people who were sitting in darkness saw a great light and to those who were sitting in the land of the shadow of death upon them a light dawned.
[time=1277] I'd never done a lot of sitting in the dark until I moved to Fort Wayne and started learning about how to hunt deer.
[time=1287] And the way you do it here is you go out when it's still dark, still black, pitch black.
[time=1292] And you have a little pin light, a little flashlight and you find your way through these trees and you finally come to the tree that you marked out earlier and up there somewhere, you got a tree stand and you climb up in there and get yourself situated and you turn your light off and you sit there for about it, 45 minutes.
[time=1306] And you can't see a thing.
[time=1308] I mean, you can't see anything.
[time=1309] It's like it was in here a minute.
[time=1310] You can't see your hand, you can't see anything at all.
[time=1313] But there's another phase that comes after the total darkness.
[time=1316] It's what I call the predon glow.
[time=1319] And the sun hasn't come over the horizon yet and it's not really light yet, but it's getting light.
[time=1324] It's slowing making its way to light.
[time=1326] And during that period of time, you can see certain forms and you can see outlines and you can see images and you can see shapes.
[time=1333] But everything is terribly vague.
[time=1336] And with so little light, you can see the shapes, but you have no depth perception and no color and there's no texture to be made out.
[time=1343] And you're subject at that point in time to a lot of misconceptions about what you think you're looking at.
[time=1352] But eventually it dawns.
[time=1354] Eventually the light does come.
[time=1357] And in a period of five or six minutes, what has been just shapes and forms and nondescript things and lots of questions in your mind about what that stuff really is out there, suddenly it all comes very clearly into focus.
[time=1370] And colors emerge and things have texture and you have depth perception.
[time=1376] And a lot of the misunderstandings and the misjudgments that you had made about your surroundings are now crystal clear because you can see them for what they truly are.
[time=1386] I would suggest to you really, in my own experience, that the best part of the hunt is that it's being out there and having a private time of worship and watching God's creation come to bloom somehow fresh and somehow new and seeing things you'd never noticed before and being undetected by all the animals that begin to move as dawn comes.
[time=1406] It's a wonderful experience.
[time=1409] The woman at the well who we met earlier in our service today was sitting in the darkness.
[time=1415] She was living in the land of the shadow of death and she was in the pre-dawn condition.
[time=1422] There was a little bit of light from creation and there was certainly some light.
[time=1426] She had the guilties as she called them from her own conscience, but she was really living in the dark.
[time=1432] She was really living in the pre-dawn condition.
[time=1434] She knew she was empty, but she didn't know why.
[time=1438] She knew that her relationships kept breaking, but she couldn't figure out how to fix them.
[time=1443] So she ran to the next one, which broke and so did the one after that and the one after that.
[time=1448] She knew she was looking for more out of life but had absolutely no idea where to find it.
[time=1454] She knew she was at least partially to blame for what was wrong in her life and the lives of those around her, but she didn't know how to fix herself because she was sitting in the darkness, things were vague.
[time=1465] She could see the shapes, she could see the image, she was aware of certain problems, but there wasn't sufficient clarity to come to grips with those problems and find solutions to those problems.
[time=1475] And so she groped her way in the pre-dawn condition, continuing to stumble and fall until she met a man named Christ.
[time=1483] And with the meeting of Christ, the light dawned and things became clear and misconceptions about herself and her former lovers and her future changed radically and irreversibly because she'd come in to the light.
[time=1501] She eventually left the conversation with Christ and ran to her city saying, "Come, see a man who told me "all things that I have done, this is not the Christ, is it?" And what she was saying is, "I get it now.
[time=1515] "I get who I am.
[time=1516] "I get what I've been doing.
[time=1520] "I get where I'm now gonna head.
[time=1521] "It's come clear to me, the light is dawned in my life.
[time=1525] "Don't you wanna come see the light?
[time=1527] "Don't you wanna begin to walk in the light "that's dawned in my life?" She was exuberant, she was persuasive.
[time=1534] Great numbers of people from that city came out to try to greet the Christ.
[time=1539] It's the first known revival in his ministry that we know of, the first great movement of people towards him because of her testimony because she saw the light.
[time=1548] In the early stages of Christ's ministry, there were a number of these very localized, I call them personal sunrises.
[time=1557] We're not for the masses and not for the great hordes, but Christ would intersect with individuals and there would be a little miniature sunrise in their life.
[time=1565] Last time we were here last Sunday, we studied the temptation of Christ and now we're gonna move a little bit later in chapter four, but a year has gone by since the temptation in what we're gonna study about his ministry in Galilee.
[time=1578] A year is transpired and we know very little about that year, John tells us really all we know.
[time=1583] We know that in that year he was at a wedding and gave kind of a personal sunrise of the people who were there as the water turned to wine and it may have done most clearly in the mind of that steward who knew for sure what had been in those vats of water and knew for sure the quality of wine that was now coming out of them and had absolutely no explanation for how that happened other than him.
[time=1603] And then in the darkness, he met with Nicodemus and a little dawn, a little sunrise happened in Nicodemus' mind and life when he found that it wasn't about work's righteousness, it was about being born again.
[time=1615] And he began to see his whole life and the truth and in the light and reality of how God saw his life.
[time=1620] Then in John 4, he met the woman at the well.
[time=1624] In fact, in John 4, he's on his way towards Galilee but has to pass through Samaria and that's Remeatser.
[time=1630] Look at verse 23 of Matthew chapter four, Jesus was going about in all Galilee.
[time=1638] In all of Galilee.
[time=1640] Galilee is an area of about 60 miles by 30 miles and is full of about 200 towns, at least it was in this particular time.
[time=1649] And each town might have had around 15,000 people.
[time=1652] Historians estimate we have three million people living in Galilee at this particular time.
[time=1656] And Jesus is now gonna spend some time in Galilee and he's gonna be in the minister and he's gonna move beyond the personal sunrises of individual encounters and he's now gonna turn the lights on for an entire region called Galilee.
[time=1670] Three million people all at once are gonna get to see the light.
[time=1674] Now they don't all respond in saving faith but they're not gonna be able to miss the reality that the light has dawned.
[time=1679] And as you know, when some people get the light, when some people see dawn, they don't like what they see and they become more entrenched in their own sin.
[time=1687] To see the light doesn't guarantee salvation but the light dawned.
[time=1690] And now he's not gonna do it person by person.
[time=1693] He's gonna do it more in this entire region and a whole group of people are gonna see the light.
[time=1700] You say, "How's he gonna do that?
[time=1702] "How's he gonna bring his light?" Look at verse 23, "And Jesus was going about "in all Galilee doing basically three things." And this is how he turns the light on.
[time=1711] He was teaching in their synagogues.
[time=1713] He was proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and he was healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.
[time=1721] Verse 24, "And the news about him went out into all Syria "and they brought to him all who were ill, "taken with various diseases and pains, "demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics, and he healed them.
[time=1731] "And great multitudes followed him from Galilee "and to capitalists in Jerusalem and Judea "and from beyond the Jordan." Basically Jesus Christ turned the light on by doing three things.
[time=1744] He taught in the synagogues, he proclaimed the gospel and he worked incredible healing miracles.
[time=1750] Now for our purposes this morning we'll group it just to two, not three categories.
[time=1754] We'll take the teaching and the proclaiming ministry and say he turned the light on with the power of his words and the second category we'll say referring to his miracles, he turned the light on through the power of his works.
[time=1766] His words and his works turned a light on a great light for the people who were living in Galilee, three million of them, all like the woman at the well, all like Nicodemus, all like somebody you know who doesn't know Christ, who's groping in the darkness, who doesn't know where to turn and in that great area Christ invaded with his light.
[time=1788] They were in the shadow of the land of death but then a light dawned, his name was Jesus.
[time=1792] Let's talk about his words, how do you do it through his words?
[time=1797] First of all he taught in the synagogues, you see that in verse 23, teaching in their synagogue.
[time=1801] Now what you need to know is that the synagogue for the Jews that were living in Galilee was the very hub, the very center of their social and cultural life, not just the hub, it was the most important place, it defined them, it said who they were and who they weren't, it was the place they would go before they would go anywhere else and it's hard for us to imagine a place of that kind of importance.
[time=1824] I mean, we would hope that the church would rise to that place in our lives where it is the church or we go to worship God and have fellowship and community with other believers that is the most important locale in the city but they held that at a much higher level than I think even we do.
[time=1839] The synagogue was everything, it was a center of Jewish life.
[time=1845] It was to them more than religion, it was where legal matters were solved, it was where political issues were taken and there was a practice in that particular day and time when there was a wonderfully enjoyed thing, people celebrated this, people looked forward to when the guest speaker would come because they would go to the synagogue for hours and hours and hours, they didn't try to get done in an hour and 10 minutes or an hour and 15 minutes so they can get out and see the cults play, just a side note.
[time=1870] (audience laughing) They would go for long periods of time and stay for hours and hours and hours and one of the joys would be when a guest speaker would come and they would give him the honor, it was customary to read the word of God and then the Old Testament and then he would expos it that truth and they loved it when that would happen.
[time=1889] And I would add to you that the speaker of truth in that particular day in that particular place was the place of highest honor.
[time=1899] They would esteem those men who could expos it the word of God higher than anyone else in the entire culture.
[time=1905] We might liken it to the way we tend to put on pinnacles, our athletes or our very successful business people or whatever the thing is in our culture that raises you to the highest level of attention and popularity and respect and admiration, that's where those teachers were.
[time=1921] And Jesus Christ came through the door of synagogue after synagogue, after synagogue, after synagogue in the area of Galilee and he lit it up literally.
[time=1934] Come with me to Matthew chapter seven, they couldn't begin to comprehend the power of his teaching.
[time=1938] He was the most gifted order the world had ever seen and he left people astonished, overwhelmed and amazed at what he was able to comprehend and communicate.
[time=1949] Now Matthew seven is the closing of the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew five, six and seven is the Sermon on the Mount and by the way we begin a study of that next week and you'll hear the greatest sermon ever told.
[time=1959] The greatest sermon ever preached is Matthew five, six and seven and though he's not in the synagogue here, I want you to catch the reaction of the people when he is done.
[time=1966] Verse 28 of Matthew seven says, the result was that when Jesus had finished these words, the multitudes were amazed at his teaching for he was teaching them as one having authority and not as their scribes.
[time=1981] The word amazed means to be overwhelmed or astounded, I mean they were gocking when he was done, they were spellbound when he was teaching.
[time=1989] This was an open amphitheater and there were a zillion things to distract them but they were riveted on that man and on his lips and what he was saying and the truth he was communicating and when he was done they were floored by it.
[time=2000] It's amazing what he did and what particularly amazed them in this setting was the authority with which he spoke.
[time=2010] You see the scribes would teach and others would teach and they were talking about a book, about somebody else's writing, about somebody else's history, about somebody else's experience.
[time=2019] They were trying to make it relevant in their day and age but Jesus, I mean he wrote the Bible and he has reservoirs of truth that so far exceed what he could put in the limited print and the ability of the human mind to conceive that when he would grab an Old Testament scripture and read it and begin to exposit it, people would just be astounded by the authority with which he would speak.
[time=2041] He wasn't talking about what somebody else said, he wasn't talking about what somebody else experienced or somebody else's insight or somebody else's truth, he was speaking his own truth because he is the author of all the word of God and they could sense it, there was something peculiar, there was something amazing, there was something wonderful when that man would speak.
[time=2061] Come to Matthew chapter 13, you'll see yet another little example of people's reaction.
[time=2068] In Matthew chapter 13, he was finishing up on the parables, you can look at verse 53, it says and it came about
[time=2078] when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there, now verse 54 of Matthew 13 and coming to his hometown, he began teaching them in their synagogue so that they became astonished and said, where did this man get his wisdom?
[time=2095] And of course, the miraculous powers that he was already evidencing by then.
[time=2100] They had never heard this kind of wisdom, wisdom was a value in the Jewish culture, far more expensive than gold or silver.
[time=2108] Remember the Proverbs, I mean wisdom, if you had wisdom, you had everything and he had so much of it they couldn't begin to conceive its origin, which was the point, he was God.
[time=2118] Wisdom is the practical skill for living, wisdom is the ability to take spiritual truth and then make it applicable and relatable to life and ways that work and if you think Solomon had this stuff, Jesus was the source of it all and they could sense it and they could feel it and they could see it.
[time=2136] And when he was done with a passage in the Old Testament, they would walk away saying, I never knew that before and it's so obvious why didn't I understand it?
[time=2144] I'd studied that a hundred times, it never was so clear to me.
[time=2148] But now that he's said it, you can't miss it, look, it's right there.
[time=2151] They wouldn't just walk away saying that, they'd walk away saying the next time he shows up to teach, I want to be there.
[time=2158] And so multitudes began to follow him, multitudes began to follow him.
[time=2162] We won't turn there today, but you could go to Matthew 22, which takes you much, much later near the very end of his ministry and they were as astounded then with his teaching as they are in Matthew 13 and as they were in Matthew 7, and my point is this, have you noticed how some speakers they grow on you?
[time=2177] I mean, the first time they wow you, the second time they wow you, but eventually you begin to learn how they do what they do, their inflections, their key phrases, and pretty soon you become familiar enough with them that their impact no longer hits you like maybe the first or second time you heard them?
[time=2192] Never happened with Christ, he never grew old.
[time=2195] He never lost his touch.
[time=2196] The people never got enough.
[time=2198] Every time he talked, he astounded them with his words.
[time=2202] The light was beginning to dawn in Galilee because Jesus Christ was beginning to open the scriptures and speak with absolute authority and perfect wisdom and the people couldn't believe their ears.
[time=2214] Back to Matthew 4, you'll notice also that his,
[time=2220] the second part of his words were his preaching.
[time=2223] And preaching is a different thing altogether.
[time=2225] It's even a different Greek word.
[time=2227] The ditticae is the teaching, it's a didactic explanation of truth, which is what he was doing in the synagogues.
[time=2232] But when he would step out of the synagogues, he would move to the carugma, which is the proclaiming, the heralding of truth, and he would stand out in the open, not teaching in a didactic fashion, but he would just herald his message like a preacher that is all incensed and inflamed in what he's doing.
[time=2248] And Christ would just preach the word of God.
[time=2251] You say, what did he say?
[time=2252] Well, look at verse 23, it says, he was proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom.
[time=2256] The word gospel means the good news.
[time=2258] And my friends, this was the first time in the history of the world when the gospel was being proclaimed.
[time=2264] John the Baptist never proclaimed the gospel.
[time=2266] John the Baptist claimed repent for the kingdom of heaven as at hand, but he left the declaration of the good news to the good news one.
[time=2274] Jesus Christ himself.
[time=2276] And this is the first preaching of the gospel, so to speak.
[time=2279] And Jesus was telling about another day and another time and sins could be forgiven and grace could come upon people and people could be healed and where he would be actually ruling and Lord of the earth in the Millennial Kingdom conditions, which they of course had studied in Isaiah.
[time=2294] And they were saying, you mean you're the one and you're the one who promises it and you're the one who can bring it.
[time=2300] He was promising them the conditions of the millennium in his preaching, offering them the kingdom of God.
[time=2305] We don't have time this morning, but the same is true.
[time=2310] He astounded them with it.
[time=2311] He awed them by it.
[time=2313] He overwhelmed them with his preaching and his teaching.
[time=2316] They would walk away saying, I never understood that before.
[time=2320] I never saw that before.
[time=2322] Now that makes sense to me, my lands.
[time=2325] When is he gonna do that again or work?
[time=2327] How can I get a ticket?
[time=2329] How can I be there?
[time=2330] They were thrilled to the core of their being.
[time=2335] You think of guys like Spurgeon who at the age of 17 years was speaking to thousands of people that he himself had drawn.
[time=2342] He wasn't a guest speaker.
[time=2344] He just began preaching and they couldn't stay away.
[time=2347] He preached to thousands of people at one time before he was even 21 years of age.
[time=2351] You think of some of the great orders that God has raised up in our land, in our day.
[time=2356] Guys like Swindall or MacArthur or whoever your favorite guy is I'm telling you, man, Jesus was so far beyond those people, it is astounding.
[time=2365] He was mesmerizing people.
[time=2368] And they walked away with clear insight thrilled to the core of their being.
[time=2373] But that wasn't even as amazing as his works.
[time=2377] Look here in verse 23, the middle of the verse.
[time=2381] He did some incredible things you guys.
[time=2383] Healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness among the people.
[time=2389] Verse 24 and the Jews, excuse me, and the news about him went out into all Syria.
[time=2395] And so they brought to him all who were ill, taken with various diseases, pains, demoniacs, epileptics, paralytics, and he healed them.
[time=2403] And then great multitudes followed him some more.
[time=2406] Now the Bible tells us about all kinds of different diseases.
[time=2412] We read of various forms of paralysis and atrophy which would encompass such things as muscular dystrophy.
[time=2418] The Bible frequently speaks of blindness which is rampant because it could be caused by countless forms of disease, infection, and injury.
[time=2424] Defness was almost as common, it had almost as many causes.
[time=2428] We are told of boils, infected glands, various forms of endema, dysteria, mutism, and all kinds of speech disorders, epilepsy, intestinal disorders, and a whole host of unidentified diseases.
[time=2441] I mean, everything we've got they've got, I would think.
[time=2444] And the Bible just lists it off one after another, after another, after another.
[time=2448] And the point is this, Jesus healed them all.
[time=2451] Now in verse 24, you'll notice that there are three categories of healings which they kind of highlight for you, Matthew does.
[time=2458] And I think what he's doing is he's giving a characterization of the healing ministry of Christ that he could heal every disease, demoniac.
[time=2466] Those would be disease and illness caused by spiritual problems, demon problems, epileptics, physical disorder of the brain, not necessarily mentally retarded, but the physical functioning of the brain, not working properly, giving physical problems as evidenced by seizures, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=2484] And then paralytics, whose brain order works fine, but a broken something, paralyzes.
[time=2491] And so you see that he was able to solve problems and heal diseases caused from spiritual sources, from mental sources, and from physical sources, was an absolutely comprehensive healing ministry.
[time=2503] Nothing was outside of his ability to heal.
[time=2506] And I gotta believe all three million of those people in the land of Galilee brought all their sick people to his presence and he healed every single one of them.
[time=2516] Jesus throws himself into the arena of human suffering and then with extraordinary compassion, ministers to the sick, the afflicted, and the demon possessed.
[time=2524] Says I love you, I care for you, I help you.
[time=2529] It's my belief, the Bible never says this, but it's my belief that Jesus Christ absolutely banished all disease from all of Palestine in his three years of ministry.
[time=2539] I don't think there was a sick person in Palestine, and if he was sick, he was only sick long enough to get in the presence of Jesus, and sometimes they didn't even have to do that.
[time=2545] They just had to send a messenger.
[time=2546] I had the greatest time this week.
[time=2549] I went through all 35 of the recorded miracles of Jesus Christ in the New Testament.
[time=2553] About 25 of them relate to healing.
[time=2555] You know, some don't, the fish, and the sea, and other miracles that he would do.
[time=2558] The preponderance of them are all about his healing ministry.
[time=2561] And I wish I could take you one by one through them.
[time=2563] I found myself in my office this week, my secretary walked in, I don't wanna know what was wrong, that I'd had a heart attack.
[time=2568] I just kept reading these things and it provoked worship in my heart as I saw him going through the cities and the byways and the highways, and life itself, and healing person after person after person after person.
[time=2582] You just can't believe what he did.
[time=2584] I can't tell you them all, let me give you a synopsis.
[time=2588] Let me give you five characteristics of the healing ministry of Christ.
[time=2591] Just quickly, just an overview.
[time=2592] Number one, he healed directly.
[time=2594] Jesus Christ healed directly with either a word or a touch.
[time=2598] In John 4, there's a royal official whose son was sick.
[time=2601] The Bible says he was at the point of death, but he lived in Capernaum nearly 20 miles away, and he said, my son is dying.
[time=2610] He is at the point of death, and Jesus Christ looked at him and said, go your way, your son lives.
[time=2615] Never in the presence of the son just spoke by the power of his word, 20 miles away, the kid is better.
[time=2621] Matthew 9, people brought a paralytic to him, and Jesus said, rise, take up your bed and go home, and he arose and went home.
[time=2628] Where are the braces?
[time=2631] Where are the prescriptions?
[time=2633] Where are the drugs?
[time=2634] Where are the consultations?
[time=2635] Where's the traction?
[time=2637] Didn't need it.
[time=2639] Just said, rise.
[time=2641] Take up your bed and go home, and the guy did.
[time=2644] In Matthew 12, he went into a synagogue, and behold, there was a man with a withered hand, and he said to the man, stretch out your hand, and he stretched it out, and it was restored to normal, like the other one.
[time=2656] So in the amount of time that it took for him to get his hand up to where it could be seen by Christ, it was healed.
[time=2661] Christ never operated on him.
[time=2663] Christ never gave him any medicines.
[time=2665] Christ didn't touch him.
[time=2666] Christ didn't do anything.
[time=2667] He just said, stretch your hand up.
[time=2668] Absolute instantaneous healing, direct healing.
[time=2673] Secondly, my mind's a little ahead of itself, is instantaneous.
[time=2676] Christ healed directly, and he healed instantaneously.
[time=2679] And John 5, listen to this, there's a man who for 38 years was sick and ailing by the pool of Beth Sada.
[time=2688] Sit in there for 38 years.
[time=2690] Christ comes and says, take up your palate and walk.
[time=2693] And immediately the Bible says, the man became well, took up his palate, and began to walk.
[time=2699] Where's the muscle atrophy problem?
[time=2701] I was in casts from my knees down for about six months at one particular point in my high school career, and when they finally took those casts off my legs, I had nothing, I had sticks, all the muscle had atrophied, and I hobbled out of the doctor's office on crutches waiting for my muscles to go to therapy so I could walk again on my own power.
[time=2718] 38 years, no therapy, no crutches, no nothing.
[time=2723] Just have a nice day, you're better now.
[time=2727] Gets up and walks out instantaneously.
[time=2730] John 9, a man with congenital blindness, born blind, always been blind, never seen.
[time=2735] His eyes had never functioned the muscles that you and I rely on upon every day and all the nerve processes that go to our brain had never functioned.
[time=2742] Can generally blind, Jesus spent on the ground, made some clay, applied it to his eyes, and said, go over there to that pool of water and wash it off, and when the man did it, the Bible says he came back seeing.
[time=2754] Then Matthew 9, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for 12 years, this dear lady had been bleeding for 12 years.
[time=2762] Christ said, to her daughter, your faith has made you well, and at once the woman was made well.
[time=2767] The Bible says, at once the woman was made well.
[time=2770] In Matthew 17, a father came up to Christ and following on his knees said, Lord have mercy on my son, for he is a lunatic, and he is very ill, for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
[time=2783] I mean, come on, think about your child, just for a minute, your son, if you don't have a son, then your daughter, and it's demon-possessed, and it's ill, and your child is falling into the fire on a regular basis, and later into the water, and it's out of control, and you don't know what's wrong and you're calling him a lunatic, and you've tried every possible solution you can think of, every witch doctor, every solution, every little remedy in the world, and none of them work.
[time=2806] But you get to Jesus, and you fall on the ground,
[time=2812] and you say, my son's a lunatic, could you help me?
[time=2815] Jesus rebuked him, and the demons came out of him,
[time=2822] and the boy was cured at once, all better, no more falling in the fire, no more falling in the water, and it doesn't get better over time, boy, you only fell in three times a day, it was six yesterday, maybe by tomorrow he won't fall in.
[time=2835] No, he just was healed instantly, and Luke 13, there's a woman who had been crippled and bent over for 18 years, this lady had not stood up straight for 18 years, she couldn't straighten up at all, the Bible says, and because of compassion, not because they needed to, he just laid his hands upon her, and immediately she was made direct.
[time=2856] Where the brace is, my friends?
[time=2859] Where's the traction, where's the operation, where's the anesthesiologists, where are the medical forms, where's the insurance, where's anything, nothing, touches her, boom, she's better.
[time=2868] He not only healed completely, excuse me, he not only healed directly, he not only healed instantaneously, he also healed completely, and this is somewhat of the same, but it's different, the guy who had been in this condition for 38 years, he didn't get healed, sort of, the guy who was born blind, his eyesight didn't sorta get better, the guy with the withered hand in the temple, he didn't look at his hand and say, oh man, you made it 50% better, I'm so thankful, the rest of my life, it'll be 50% better, I can use it now, I'm not as embarrassed of it, no, completely totally healed, the Bible says, it was like the other one, amazing.
[time=2910] Fourthly, he brought people back from the dead, what does a disease do when it's done, all it's gonna do, it kills you?
[time=2915] What does disease do when it does all it's gonna do, it kills you?
[time=2919] And Jesus had so much power, he could even reverse the final culmination of disease, we call that death.
[time=2926] In Luke seven, Christ was making his way down a road, and he happened upon a funeral possession, the Bible says a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.
[time=2937] You get it?
[time=2938] He comes down the road, he sees his funeral possession, he recognizes the guy who's dead is the only son of that woman, and that woman is a widow, which means in her day and in her age, in her culture she is helpless, she is defenseless, and no one can care for her.
[time=2951] She needs either a husband or a son to survive.
[time=2953] With any dignity.
[time=2957] And so Jesus, the Bible said, saw her and felt compassion on her, and he came up and touched the coffin and said, young man, I say to you, arise.
[time=2967] And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and I love this part, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.
[time=2974] Can't you see Jesus going to that coffin now, he's sitting up speaking, he helps him out, and he walks him over the thing, he says to the dear lady, here's your son.
[time=2981] And you gotta know, he's thinking a little bit about his own death, when he hands him back.
[time=2988] So let's, that's enough of that separation stuff, that's enough of that Eli, Eli subbachth, anything.
[time=2993] My God, my God, why has stuff, enough of the separation.
[time=2996] Let me just bring you back to your mother.
[time=2998] And Matthew nine, there's a synagogue official
[time=3006] by the name of Jarras, who came to Christ and fell down before him, saying, my little daughter has just died, my sweet precious little daughter has just died, but oh Christ, come and lay your hand on her and she will live.
[time=3020] And so Jesus came to the house, and when he arrived there, the officials, excuse me, when he arrived there, the flute players and the crowd was already in a noisy disorder, and he began to say to them, "Depart, for the girl has not died, she is but asleep." Now you see, in that day and that age, when you had somebody die, you paid people to come with the flute and they came for the professional mourners and the way you really expressed your grief and the way you fit into that whole culture was you made as much of a ruckus as you could when that person died.
[time=3047] And a lot of the ruckus, the more you loved them and the deeper your grief, that's just how they did it.
[time=3051] By the time Jesus can show up, she is so dead that they've already called the professional mourners in and they got a big crowd going on and they're doing their big morning thing and he says, "Excuse me, could y'all leave?" She's not dead, she's just asleep.
[time=3063] And the Bible says they began to laugh at him.
[time=3066] They were mocking him.
[time=3069] You idiot, she's dead.
[time=3071] But then the Bible says, but when the crowd had been put out, he entered into the house, took her by the hand and the girl arose, she said, "Come here, Oni." Stand up, takes her out, gives her back to her dad.
[time=3091] She says, "Here's your little daughter." Enough of this death.
[time=3094] Enough of the ultimate consequence of disease.
[time=3097] Here's your daughter back.
[time=3098] And of course, in John 11, he raised his own friend from the dead.
[time=3102] Remember Lazarus, he was already in his tomb.
[time=3105] He'd been there for four days.
[time=3107] The people around him were saying, "Don't roll that thing away, Jesus.
[time=3110] "Don't open that tomb up.
[time=3111] "He's been in there for four days.
[time=3112] "He's gonna stink the high heavens.
[time=3114] "He's not a good thing.
[time=3115] "This isn't one you wanna be messing with.
[time=3117] "He's been dead too long." Jesus et al, just roll that back for a minute.
[time=3122] Lazarus, come here for a minute.
[time=3123] Come here.
[time=3126] Out comes Lazarus.
[time=3129] The Bible says he was all wrapped up, came forth, bound, hand, and foot with wrappings.
[time=3133] And Jesus said, "I'm bind him and let him go." Enough of the death.
[time=3136] Enough of the death.
[time=3140] It's amazing, isn't it?
[time=3142] The light was dawning in Galilee, my friends.
[time=3144] The light was dawning in Palestine.
[time=3146] The irresistible, unmistakable, irrefutable light of God had arrived because he healed directly.
[time=3153] He healed instantaneously.
[time=3155] He healed completely.
[time=3156] He healed even death.
[time=3158] And lastly, he healed everybody.
[time=3161] There wasn't anybody they ever brought to him.
[time=3162] He couldn't heal.
[time=3164] He healed absolutely every single person they ever brought, and to push the point, look at what it says in verse 24.
[time=3171] "And the news about him spread into all Syria, now it's beyond Galilee.
[time=3174] It's all the way into Syria." And they brought to him all who were ill, taken with various diseases, pains, demoniacs, epileptic, paralytics, which means every category of sickness and origin thereof, and he made them all better.
[time=3186] I don't believe he ever met a person he didn't heal.
[time=3189] That's why I believe he banished disease from Palestine.
[time=3192] I believe he's just gone.
[time=3197] Now you think about that here in terms of Fort Wayne, just for a minute, will you?
[time=3200] What happens if Jesus shows up in Fort Wayne, city of about 300,000 people?
[time=3203] Do you realize there wouldn't be one of us living in this town who didn't either have a close family member or a close personal friend who we knew first hand had been healed by his touch?
[time=3214] He would have touched all of us, even though all of us aren't sick, because all of us have friends who are.
[time=3218] All of us have family members who are, and we would have up close personal accounts of the way Jesus healed.
[time=3224] And all of us would be able to hear a story about somebody we know or in a second generation know who got healed.
[time=3230] And I'll tell you something right now, if you were sitting in this place and you knew that Jesus were in this town, you would grab the people that you know who are sick and you would get them into his presence and if they were too sick to come, you'd go on their behalf.
[time=3241] You wouldn't go to lunch.
[time=3243] You wouldn't go anywhere else if you really loved that person, you'd get a meat and that's exactly what was happening.
[time=3248] They were flooding to him from all over Galilee, then all over Syria, and then as the text wraps its way up all over Diapolis, Jerusalem, and Judea even beyond the Jordan.
[time=3257] As far as the news could travel, they grabbed their sick people and they rushed into his presence and he healed, and he healed, and he healed, and he healed, and he healed, and he healed.
[time=3267] Unmistakable light of God.
[time=3273] Do you understand Matthew 4.16?
[time=3275] Look at it again.
[time=3277] The people were sitting in darkness.
[time=3280] They were sitting in spiritual darkness.
[time=3282] They had questions they needed answered.
[time=3283] They needed direction they didn't have.
[time=3285] They needed conviction over the sin they didn't have.
[time=3287] They were utterly engulfed in the darkness of their own sin, but they saw a great light, and he was the son of God, and he came to them doing unbelievable miracles and on the heels and intermingled with that, he spoke to them the words of life and his teaching and his preaching so they could repent of their sin and embrace him as their savior and know what it means to be at peace with God and then to walk with the light of the world, namely Jesus Christ.
[time=3313] Is it any wonder that Simeon, do you remember Simeon in Luke?
[time=3317] Chapter two, the devout righteous Jew who was always about the work of the Lord, always in the temple, and he so desperately wanted to see the Messiah, this is before the birth of Christ, and the Holy Spirit came to Simeon and said, my friend, you will not die until you see the Messiah, and Simeon hung onto that promise day after day, after day, after day, until finally Joseph and Mary showed up in the temple as they were acquired by custom, and the Holy Spirit revealed that is the Messiah and Simeon went over to that kid and grabbed him in his arms and cradled him there, and he said this, for my eyes, my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people in Israel.
[time=3362] And you can see him, lift him to baby Jesus, up turning circles in the middle of the temple, saying he's here, he's here, and I've seen him with my eyes and he's the light of revelation to all the Gentiles and to your people in the Israelites.
[time=3375] The light is finally dawned, but we can get out of the darkness once and for all.
[time=3380] I got one question for you.
[time=3386] You sit in the darkness?
[time=3393] Well, it's light in here, at least it was a minute ago, won't be in a second.
[time=3398] Is this a description of your spiritual condition?
[time=3401] And all you've had so far is a little bit of knowledge of God through creation, and all you've had so far is a little bit of knowledge of God through your conscience that you know you're a sinner and you know something's wrong in your life, but you like the woman at the well, you don't know how to fix it, you don't know where to go, you don't know what the solutions are, you don't know how to get your life right, you've tried a hundred times and every time you make a worse mess of your life, are you sitting in the darkness today?
[time=3422] I got great news, Colossians, chapter one, tells us a wonderful truth and astounding truth.
[time=3430] Look at this, God is in the business of delivering people out of the domain of darkness and transferring them into the kingdom of his beloved son.
[time=3439] And through his son, you can have redemption, which means the forgiveness of your sins, and my friends, you can walk the rest of your life in the light, but if you're here today and you don't know Christ, I wanna pray with you here just for a minute before we close, just for a brief moment.
[time=3457] And if you feel the Holy Spirit prompting your heart, like he prompted the heart of Simeon, and if you can not see the life of Christ, but you can hear the truth about him from his word and you recognize him to be the light of the world and the answer to your problems, the forgiver of your sins, and you wanna accept Christ as your savior.
[time=3474] You can do it right now in the privacy of your seat.
[time=3477] Would you bow your heads with me for just a moment so we could pray?
[time=3484] If you're bowin' your head, and as I hope you all are, but you're the one that the Spirit of God is speaking to this morning, and you wanna come out of the darkness into the light, I invite you to pray this little prayer.
[time=3497] It goes like this.
[time=3498] My gracious God and heavenly Father, I know that I am in the darkness of my own sin, and I hate the darkness and I hate my sin.
[time=3512] And I want so terribly to be forgiven so that I can walk in the light, make sense of my life, and I thank you for Jesus Christ who died in my place to forgive me for my sins.
[time=3526] Then I ask him to be my savior right now, to come into my heart and into my life so that I can walk in the light.
[time=3534] We pray these things in Jesus' name.
