[time=30] The price of admission.
[time=44] On the particular day that our Lord delivered the Sermon on the Mount about 2,000 years ago a great multitude had gathered.
[time=51] And as they were gathering and finding their places there on that hillside in Galilee somewhere,
[time=57] their I believe was a sense of energy, kind of a buzz that was going across the crowd.
[time=61] And there was a tremendous sense of anticipation to hear this particular sermon.
[time=67] I think some of that energy was filled with tension and anxiety because Christ was going
[time=73] to clarify the admission price for heaven.
[time=77] He was going to once and for all set the record straight if you want to get in to a place called heaven.
[time=83] He referred to it as the kingdom of God.
[time=85] This is what it would take.
[time=87] This is how much it would cost.
[time=89] This is who you'd have to be.
[time=91] These are the entrance requirements the price of admission into heaven.
[time=103] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Blackhawk Baptist Church.
[time=107] Thank you for joining us.
[time=108] Have you ever noticed that most of the really exciting places you want to go require a pretty steep admission price?
[time=114] Disney World, Harvard Law School, residents in an exclusive housing development.
[time=119] Have you ever wondered what the admission price is to heaven?
[time=122] About 2,000 years ago a great multitude gathered on a hillside in Galilee because they heard Jesus was going to explain the admission price to heaven.
[time=130] Stay with us today to find out what he said.

[time=859] Everything about the price of admission.
[time=863] I remember going to Disneyland out in Southern California where I grew up for the very first time and I'll never forget it.
[time=869] We drove up with the family in the family car and you could see the monorail going around the top and you could begin to see the matter horn that would poke up above the protective wall or fence that guarded Disneyland.
[time=879] And as you got closer, more of the Disney figures were portrayed and your mind could imagine and anticipate all that you'd already seen on television watching Disney's wonderful world of whatever that was.
[time=890] And you just wanted to get inside.
[time=893] And what I think escaped my notice then because I probably just mentally jumped in the park was that my dad in order to get us there had to stand at the gate and pay out a lot of money that he had worked hard to earn so that we could find our way into the Magic Kingdom.
[time=910] But the price had to be paid.
[time=913] While in college, he met a good friend who this day is a good friend and his heart was set on being an attorney.
[time=920] I mean, he could see his life as an attorney.
[time=923] He would talk about the court cases.
[time=925] He would battle.
[time=926] He would talk about the suits he would wear and the nice car and he would drive and the high-rise office he would have as an attorney.
[time=931] And he lived out there in the future, but he was also very aware of the fact that there was an admission price to be paid.
[time=938] This time, not money, but it was going to be an academic price.
[time=942] Academic achievements, personal accomplishments in the academic arena before he would ever be able to get inside of a law school much less past the bar and actually be a practicing attorney.
[time=953] He was very aware of the admission price that was associated with becoming an attorney.
[time=958] We would sometimes vacation in the Palm Springs area out in California where I grew up and we stayed in some of the more modest places, happy, frankly, to be there at all.
[time=968] But we would drive by some of these extravagant developments.
[time=972] And the entrances of them were just huge and marvelous, all kinds of stone work and wrought iron fences.
[time=978] And as you drive on by, you peek through the wrought iron fences and see the manicured fairways and the huge pools and the jacuzzis and the palatial condominiums.
[time=987] And we would remark, boy, I wonder how much money it takes to be able to live in there.
[time=992] And you never even got to go inside of there unless you paid the admission price because they had guards and cameras and little lists of acceptable people, people who had paid the price or guests of people who had paid the price.
[time=1004] The admission price was very steep.
[time=1007] Well, on this wonderful morning or afternoon, whenever it was that our Lord gave the Sermon on the Mount, there was a sense of energy and a buzz that must have been across the great multitude that gathered on that hillside to wait for his arrival because it was this day that he was going to announce the admission price not to an amusement park and not to a law school and not to an exclusive housing development but to the kingdom of God, heaven itself.
[time=1038] And people were there and people were excited and people were getting situated and people were hoping that he would stand in near proximity to them and that they would be able to hear without the aid of microphone so that they could catch the very essence of what it would take to be able to go to heaven.
[time=1055] And I imagine along with the energy and the buzz, there was a level of tension and a level of anxiety.
[time=1062] As people would wonder, "Gee, I wish, I hope, will I have enough to get in?"
[time=1069] You see, by this point, they'd already heard enough from Jesus about the kingdom of God.
[time=1075] He had described it for them.
[time=1077] He had told them what it was going to be like in the kingdom of God.
[time=1080] And it was a place of joy.
[time=1082] It was a place of satisfaction.
[time=1084] It was a place where you were thrilled to the core of your being every day to be in the kingdom.
[time=1088] And whatever it is that you and I would hope for in terms of an amusement park experience or a certain vocation or a beautiful home and a place to live, the kingdom of God offered that times ten.
[time=1099] And he'd been describing and teaching and preaching all about what it was going to be like.
[time=1104] And so they'd heard enough.
[time=1106] And they'd even seen enough to authenticate that he was truly the son of God
[time=1112] and not just some carpenter from Nazareth.
[time=1114] He was that, but he was more.
[time=1116] He was the son of God.
[time=1118] And so he would perform miracle after miracle after miracle so that the people could understand that he wasn't just a normal human being, that in fact he was God's son.
[time=1129] And that authenticated his message.
[time=1131] But those miracles also gave people a little bit of a foretaste of what heaven would be like.
[time=1137] Because as that paralyzed person would get up and walk, and as that blind person would suddenly be able to see.
[time=1144] And as that withered hand would suddenly return back to original form or proper form, they would begin to reflect upon his teaching that in the kingdom of God there will be no sickness and there will be no deformities and there will be no death and there will be no tears.
[time=1159] And so they not only understood, oh he is the son of God.
[time=1162] They began to sense the excitement and the joy and the wonder of what it would be like to live inside the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1169] They had heard enough and they had seen enough.
[time=1172] They wanted to go.
[time=1174] That's why they gathered that day.
[time=1176] The bigger question was this, will I be able to go?
[time=1181] Will I have the admission price?
[time=1183] Will I have the stuff that on that fateful day, the day of reckoning, when I stand before God, will I have what it takes to be able to get in to heaven?
[time=1195] And so a great sense of anticipation, people wanted to know what the requirements were but with that a sense of tension, personal tension and anxiety,
[time=1206] as they're mold over in their mind before the sermon began, what does it take to get into heaven?
[time=1214] Let me tell you the outcome before we kind of look at some of the specifics.
[time=1220] The crowd that day left astonished.
[time=1224] When he was done preaching the sermon on the Mount, three chapters in the book of Matthew 5, 6 and 7,
[time=1230] not a real long sermon.
[time=1232] The Bible says that the people were absolutely astonished.
[time=1236] They were in shock.
[time=1237] They were overwhelmed and there were two predominant reactions to his sermon.
[time=1243] One reaction was that of being terribly offended.
[time=1247] There was a group of people there that day that when he articulated the requirements for entrance into the kingdom, the admission price, they became very offended at what he said.
[time=1258] And over the course of time, the next two and a half years of his ministry, they began to resist him more adamantly and more openly until they finally tried to counsel away to kill him.
[time=1270] They were so incensed and so offended by what he said is the admission price to heaven.
[time=1279] But there was an entirely different group there that day.
[time=1282] I mean, they're all in the same crowd, but an entirely different reaction from a number of people.
[time=1287] And for this group of people, for the first time in their lives, they began to have a sense of hope.
[time=1295] Something was awakened in them that day and they began to have a sense of hope that maybe, just maybe,
[time=1303] they would be able to go to the kingdom of God, that they would be able to get past those foreboding gates, that they could take residence for all eternity in heaven with God.
[time=1314] Let me tell you about the first group, the offended group.
[time=1318] They were the group in the crowd that are called the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=1322] They were the religious leaders of the day.
[time=1325] And they became incredibly offended at what the Lord said was admission price to the kingdom of God.
[time=1334] You see, they had operated all their life. In fact, they were in a long tradition of their fathers and grandfathers,
[time=1340] and as their family tree would go back, they were a part of the strong belief that admission into the kingdom of God
[time=1348] came as a result of dedication to some kind of religious activity.
[time=1355] They believed, they were convinced, and they had devoted their lives to the notion that on the day of reckoning God was going to look at their lives and examine it for possible merit
[time=1367] as expressed in religious devotion.
[time=1371] And those people standing before God, they believe on that day of reckoning, who had enough spiritual resources like money buys you into an amusement park or academic achievement get you into law school or money buys you into an exclusive housing development.
[time=1387] They were under the belief that one was required to earn the spiritual brownie points,
[time=1393] the spiritual good deeds, the spiritual resources, and have enough of those so that when they stood before God they could in essence buy their way in.
[time=1401] And I don't mean that in a negative way, just have earned it, just deserve it, just be qualified for it.
[time=1406] They were utterly and completely sold out to that notion.
[time=1410] In fact, they had given their lives to it.
[time=1413] They had quit their normal jobs so that they could devote themselves to the process of earning enough spiritual resource to gain entrance into the kingdom of God.
[time=1423] And so they fasted, they would go days and days and days without eating.
[time=1428] And they prayed, and they would pray long, and they would pray loud, and they would pray regular.
[time=1436] And they would serve in the temple, they would do whatever tasks needed to be done in and around the temple in Jerusalem.
[time=1442] And they would give alms out of their resources, they would give money to the temple and more money to the temple, and they would do that as often as they could.
[time=1451] And then they took up a study of the law itself.
[time=1454] At that time, of course, just the Old Testament, the New Testament wasn't written yet.
[time=1459] And they so carefully studied the Old Testament that they were able to accurately determine
[time=1465] that in the Old Testament, there are 248 positive commands,
[time=1471] things that God said they should do, 248 of them.
[time=1476] They also studied out and figured that there were 365 negative commands, things you should not do.
[time=1483] And they would begin to give themselves not only to the observing of all that stuff,
[time=1489] but to the memorizing of all that stuff.
[time=1491] It was amazing.
[time=1493] They did it over and over. They would put it in a cross stick and have different letters to start each command, and they would commit it to memory because they didn't ever want to be in a situation where they were breaking one of the things they shouldn't do or failing to do one of the things that they were supposed to do.
[time=1509] In fact, they went further than that. Not only did they commit much of it to memory, and try as carefully as they could to observe it all, they wanted to put some insulation in there between them and a violation of the law of God.
[time=1521] So they would add some traditions that would keep them two steps away from actually breaking what the Bible said.
[time=1527] For example, the Bible said that on the Sabbath you were supposed to rest and do no work to keep it holy.
[time=1536] And they didn't ever want to violate that law, and this is just an example.
[time=1539] So what they did was they added stuff to what God had said to keep them a couple steps back
[time=1545] from an actual violation.
[time=1547] To the command not to work on the Sabbath one historian has said, they added the idea of carrying a burden as a form of work.
[time=1555] And so on the Sabbath, you're not only supposed to not go out and plow your field, which would be commonly understood as work, but to get a couple steps back from that, they said you're not allowed to carry anything that represents a burden.
[time=1567] Well, they had been to define, well, how much is that?
[time=1570] I mean, how much are you carrying when you're carrying a burden?
[time=1573] This historian says this, they decided that a burden was food equal to the weight of a fig.
[time=1581] So all day long you couldn't carry any food heavier than the weight of a fig.
[time=1586] Required, obviously, that everything be prepared in advance and be done in very small portions so you could at least eat on that day.
[time=1592] They went on to say a burden was enough wine for mixing in a goblet, or milk, enough for one swallow, honey, enough to put on a wound, oil enough to anoint a small member of the body, water enough to moisten an eyesave or a covering for the eye.
[time=1608] Listen to this one, ink enough to write two letters of the alphabet.
[time=1614] You see, they added all kinds of their own little traditions to make sure that they didn't violate the thing that God had said not to do.
[time=1622] And then they worked as hard as they could not to violate all of that.
[time=1629] And I would suggest to you that history has seldom seen a more devoted and committed group of religious people.
[time=1637] I think there are probably other times in the history of the world, other centuries, other generations, other locations, and other religions where we could find people with an equal amount of zeal to trying to earn the spiritual resources to gain entrance to the kingdom of God, but I don't think you'll find a group that surpasses the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=1657] They were out there. In fact, they became the standard of righteousness.
[time=1662] For the people who lived in Palestine in that day, if they wanted to ask themselves, "How am I doing in the righteousness category?
[time=1670] How am I doing in terms of earning the pleasure of God and the ability to gain entrance to the kingdom of God?" They would not only look at the scriptures, but they would look at the scribes and the Pharisees and they would compare their lives to them.
[time=1684] And the relative difference would be the amount of concern that they would have over their ability to get into heaven.
[time=1690] And as they were talking that day, probably before, the Sermon on the Mount, as the energy was going, and as people were discussing this issue, who gets in and who doesn't get in?
[time=1700] If you were to have taken a poll or a vote of that crowd, and you were to ask in that poll, "Who's going to get in?" Based upon what you believe right now, the crowd would have unanimously and unequivocally pointed to the scribes and the Pharisees and said, "These are the people who are going." That's for sure, because nobody's more committed.
[time=1721] Nobody's more committed in trying to be right with God than they are.
[time=1727] And if you were to say to them, "Well, who is least likely to go?" They would have pointed out, "Oh, the prostitutes that might have been there." And they certainly would have pointed out the tax gatherers.
[time=1739] Those were the Jewish people who had turned on their country to become tax collectors for the Roman government.
[time=1745] And these were the despised of Israel.
[time=1748] They were hated by the people of Israel because these tax gatherers would take their inside information about the Jewish culture and that city and who made money and how much.
[time=1756] And they would use that insider information to extract taxes, give what was required to Rome, and they would always take extra for themselves and notoriously became very wealthy.
[time=1766] And they were the despised.
[time=1769] They were traitors.
[time=1772] But they would have said, "Be on a shadow of a doubt, the people who are going to heaven, the people who are going to make it to heaven, are these scribes and these Pharisees." Which is why I think the crowd was a little shocked to say the least.
[time=1786] And you might take your Bible if you have one and come to Matthew chapter 5 when Jesus said this very provocative and as the drama noted, counterculture statement.
[time=1798] This took a lot of people back.
[time=1801] This was part of the reason they were so shocked.
[time=1806] With that as a kind of a cultural backdrop and an identity on the scribes and the Pharisees, look at what Jesus says is entrance requirement number one into the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1816] Matthew chapter 5 verse 20.
[time=1821] For I say to you, this is Jesus in His sermon saying this, that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1833] Oh man, what?
[time=1836] Unless my righteousness surpasses the world record holders of religion I can't go.
[time=1844] There's a level of righteousness that's higher than theirs.
[time=1849] There's something wrong with their righteousness.
[time=1852] There's something wrong with their approach to getting in.
[time=1856] I mean, they're not enough.
[time=1859] And you could almost hear the whispers run across the crowd say, what in the world's wrong with the Pharisees and the scribes?
[time=1869] Well, the Lord begins to clarify that.
[time=1875] It is sermon.
[time=1876] In fact, that's kind of what comes next.
[time=1878] And we don't have time to do the whole sermon this morning.
[time=1880] We don't have time to take it a piece by a piece because not only does the Lord describe here what it takes to get into heaven, He describes and gives this beautiful picture of what a Christian looks like and how the Christian life is supposed to be lived.
[time=1893] And so we'll ponder that over time.
[time=1896] But for this morning, let me just give you the high points of what He said, why in the world?
[time=1900] What does it take?
[time=1901] What was wrong with the righteousness of these religious superstars, the scribes and the Pharisees?
[time=1908] I'll just give you three instances from the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1911] The first one is found in verse 21.
[time=1914] Jesus says, you have heard that the ancients were told, you shall not commit murder.
[time=1920] And whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.
[time=1922] Now that, as you know, is one of the Ten Commandments.
[time=1925] And the Lord, by picking this one, isn't trying to, like, grab some obtuse little known truth out of the Old Testament.
[time=1932] He is instead just lifting one of the better known of all the things that has ever been said by most people who have ever lived out of the Old Testament.
[time=1939] You're not supposed to commit murder.
[time=1940] That's one of the Ten Commandments.
[time=1942] And He is saying, yeah, that's really true.
[time=1943] But look at verse 22.
[time=1946] But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court.
[time=1951] And whoever shall say to his brother, Raka, shall be guilty before the Supreme Court.
[time=1956] And whoever shall say you fool shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.
[time=1963] You see what He says here?
[time=1965] He's saying, yeah, murder is wrong and you're not supposed to murder.
[time=1968] But if you want to have the righteousness required to get into the kingdom of God, it's not just that you didn't murder somebody.
[time=1975] It's that you've never even been angry with anyone.
[time=1978] It's a matter not just of your behavior.
[time=1981] It's a matter of your heart.
[time=1983] The Lord is saying that true righteousness, the kind of righteousness
[time=1990] that you have to earn in order to gain acceptance into the kingdom of God, is not just a failure to murder someone.
[time=1996] It is if you have ever been angry with them, the word Raka would be like a cultural cuss word of the day, so to speak.
[time=2003] It'd be like us saying you jerk or you something else, something else, something else that I dare not say here on Sunday because it's so inappropriate.
[time=2011] He's just saying, have you ever been to the place where in your heart you looked at a person and you said to yourself, I am so mad at you.
[time=2016] I'm so mad at you.
[time=2018] Lord says you missed the bar.
[time=2022] Your righteousness is not enough.
[time=2025] Man, that's quite the standard, isn't it?
[time=2029] Now all of a sudden he's gone from the cosmetic, the externals of not murdering somebody which is important.
[time=2035] He drives right to the very core of a person's heart and says, my friend's righteousness comes from the heart and unless you are pure of heart, you don't come through the kingdom of God.
[time=2045] Look at another one.
[time=2049] Just in that same chapter, verse 27.
[time=2052] He says, you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery.
[time=2057] That's another one of the 10 commandments.
[time=2059] Another one that everybody probably knew and he picks murder and he picks adultery because those are probably two of the worst things that are out there.
[time=2066] Those are part of the big 10.
[time=2068] And he says, yeah, you're not supposed to commit adultery, but look at verse 28.
[time=2072] But I say to you that everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
[time=2080] See, there he is again, in his heart, in his heart, in your heart.
[time=2084] He's saying it's bad and it's sinful and there is no place
[time=2090] for you to commit adultery with somebody else, somebody else's wife or somebody else's husband depending upon your sex.
[time=2097] But real righteousness doesn't even look at that other person
[time=2104] and have a desire to be with them.
[time=2107] And once again, God shatters the notion that righteousness is merely an external behavior of ritual and religion and coming to church or going to the synagogue and keeping this law and not carrying that amount of honey and not carrying that amount of ink and not doing this and not doing that.
[time=2125] He says, wait a minute, righteousness is a matter of what's inside of you, not just what you do.
[time=2133] And you look at that standard and I mean they did as we would even now and say I can't meet that standard.
[time=2139] I mean who among us could stand up today and say not only have I not murdered anyone,
[time=2145] I've never been angry with anyone.
[time=2148] I've never once been angry with anyone even in my heart.
[time=2152] I mean not only have I not yelled at the person because I was angry but I mean in the inner recesses of my heart and my mind I was never even angry with anyone.
[time=2161] How many of us could stand up here today and say not only have I never committed adultery but I have never even looked at a person with lust in my eyes or my heart.
[time=2169] Never.
[time=2171] And of course these are just two samples.
[time=2174] Man, that's a standard isn't it?
[time=2178] It's as if there's a bar like a high jump bar and the Pharisees said it just at the very very top of their ability which would have been to live all these laws at least on the outside to the best of their ability and the common masses are looking at the height of that bar saying I can't clear that bar there's no way I can clear that bar.
[time=2197] They were already intimidated and then the Lord came along and put it like up another 30 feet and people were laughing and it was just impossible.
[time=2206] I can't live like that.
[time=2208] I can't clear that height.
[time=2210] He points out another issue that he wanted them to think about.
[time=2215] It's in chapter six and it's an attitude of spiritual pride.
[time=2219] Oftentimes people who are engaged in the premise that they're going to earn their way into the kingdom of God that God's going to take their life put it in a balance and the good works will outdo the bad works and so they have earned their way in.
[time=2233] Oftentimes there's a very subtle sort of spiritual pride that creeps into the heart of those people.
[time=2241] He says this in verse one of chapter six, be aware of practicing your righteousness before men to be noticed by them.
[time=2248] Otherwise you have no reward with your father who is in heaven.
[time=2252] When therefore you give alms do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may be honored by men.
[time=2260] Truly I say to you you have your reward in full.
[time=2263] But when you give alms do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing that your alms may be in secret and your father who sees in secret will repay you.
[time=2271] What he is saying is that when people begin to believe that they are working their way and earning the kinds of spiritual resources that gain entrance into the kingdom of God.
[time=2281] They begin to put that a little bit on display for other people to see.
[time=2285] They begin to kind of have a comparative mentality that I'm a little better than that other person.
[time=2290] I'm a little better than that other person.
[time=2292] I'm not the best person.
[time=2293] I mean I'm not Mother Teresa but I'm not Charles Manson either and I'm somewhere in this category of the meritorious group.
[time=2301] And when I stand there before God somehow maybe by the skin of my teeth that scale is going to tilt in my favor.
[time=2308] And a spiritual pride begins to seep its way into the heart of an individual.
[time=2314] And instead of all that religious activity being done from a pure heart to honor God it becomes kind of a proud self-centered righteousness that we try to achieve on our own.
[time=2326] Well needless to say about now people in the crowd are feeling pretty gloom.
[time=2333] People's hopes are pretty much shattered.
[time=2337] People are thinking of themselves this is trouble.
[time=2341] Because if he's telling the truth there's no way.
[time=2346] There's no way I'm in.
[time=2350] Well the tragedy in this is that all the study that these guys had made
[time=2357] of the Old Testament where they could identify 248 positive commands and 365 negative commands.
[time=2363] You know they had done somewhat of a selective study of the Old Testament and they had gone over the tops of some very important verses.
[time=2369] Some very important truths.
[time=2371] Let me share a few of them with you.
[time=2373] Listen to what one verse said that they didn't include.
[time=2378] It says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might." These scribes and Pharisees had reduced their gaining entrance in the kingdom of God
[time=2390] down to just their behavior alone and had jumped over the issue of their heart.
[time=2394] It says in Psalm 1914 one man was praying there he says, "Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable and I sight O Lord my rock and my redeemer." I mean he was praying God not just my words not just my behavior but God helped me with my heart because my heart needs to be acceptable to you.
[time=2415] Another one prayed in the Old Testament, "Search me O God and know my heart.
[time=2420] Try me and know my anxious thoughts and see if there be any hurtful way in me and lead me in the way everlasting." And what that prayer is saying is God not just my behavior but you search, put the spotlight on the condition of my heart and my attitudes and what I think about and what I want out of life, try me and know me and lead me in the path that leads to life.
[time=2442] But they had jumped over those, they had excluded those because it was just too intimidating for them.
[time=2450] The Bible says they annulled the law of God, they would take some of the requirements out and leave only the stuff they felt they could actually accomplish on their own.
[time=2461] And it grieved the heart of God when they did that.
[time=2464] He said one time in the Old Testament because this people draw near with their words and honor me with their lip service but they removed their hearts far from me and their reverence for me consists of traditions learned by rote.
[time=2478] You say man I'm tired of you guys doing these religious activities over and over and over again
[time=2484] and you serve me with your lips and you serve me with your tradition but it doesn't come from your heart.
[time=2491] He eventually said this I hate, that's a strong little phrase here for God to say I hate and I reject your festivals which was their religious devotion nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies when they would all get together as a big crowd.
[time=2504] Even though you offer up to me burnt offerings and your grain offerings I will not accept them and I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings those would be the animals that they would offer to try to make worship to God.
[time=2518] He says this take away from me the noise of your songs I will not even listen to the sound of your harps God is actually repulsed by people who think that they can earn righteousness
[time=2532] enough to gain admission into the kingdom of God because their hearts are not given over to God and they evaluate themselves on their behavior only because an honest assessment of the full condition of their life
[time=2546] wouldn't leave them standing saying I'm worthy to get into the kingdom of God and so they reduce the requirements to something that God never said they were just behavior alone and God says oh that is so hard to hear from you please stop your singing please stop your musical instruments please stop the offering of your animals you're making a mockery of what it means to be in the kingdom of God it's never just about externals it's about a heart that truly loves God so they were shocked because they had to recognize that no one is good enough
[time=2583] nobody meets that standard nobody can clear that bar not even the spiritual heroes of their day the scribes and the Pharisees no matter how hard we try they would have been saying to themselves we can never work hard enough because we can never get our lives pure in the total sense of our hearts and our thoughts as well as our behavior the standard is too high and like I say about then people I'm sure we're beginning to feel a little bit overwhelmed by the requirement but let me take you back now to the beginning of the sermon
[time=2617] come with me to chapter 5
[time=2624] and this you can see from the drama and then from the word of God it says in verse 1 and when he saw the multitudes he went up on the mountain and after he sat down his disciples came to him and opening his mouth he began to teach them saying now here are the first words out of his mouth blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God
[time=2646] you say who gets to go into the kingdom of God?
[time=2649] Jesus is saying the poor in spirit get to go into the kingdom of God and you say what does that mean? who are the poor in spirit?
[time=2656] well first of all this does not mean economic distress this is not talking about being poor financially and there is no promise anywhere that poor people physically poor people get to go to heaven that's never taught anywhere in the Bible they may have a little head start in that their life is a little harder it makes them more open to spiritual things but there is nowhere a teaching in the Bible that financially poor people get to go to heaven that's not what the Bible says this phrase doesn't say financially poor it says poor in spirit what does that mean? these are people who are the absolute opposite of the scribes and the Pharisees who had all their spiritual works who were comparing themselves to other people who were storing up spiritual treasure so when they stand at the gate of God they say we got what it takes to get in here look at all we have accomplished look at how the scales on our life tilt by our good works we're in because we earned it a person who is poor in spirit says you know what I don't see how they feel that way about themselves I'll tell you how I feel about me I'm nothing but a sinner and I can't measure up to either of the standards either the behavioral standard or the internal standard of my heart I'm a wreck I am nothing but a wreck oh I try I make an effort to live a respectable life but God you know who I am you see the condition of my heart you see the things I think about you see the things I do the way I treat people I don't deserve heaven any more than anybody could ever none of us do poor in spirit a true brokenness over sin listen to another one of the Old Testament passages that the scribes and the Pharisees selectively jumped over it says this God is speaking to this one I will look you say who is God going to look to for the kingdom of heaven to this one I will look to him who is humble and contrite of spirit who trembles at my word now there's a contrast to the scribes and the Pharisees the scribes and the Pharisees took the word of God they deleted the parts that they didn't like but then they left it there and said we don't tremble at that we fulfill it if it says to do it we do it and we do it all the time and we do it better than everybody else we don't tremble at the word of God we fulfill them and God says man I don't want anything to do with a person like that because they're lying to themselves they're proud and they're arrogant and they're selective in their view of true righteousness Jesus I mean God says I look to the person who is humble and contrite of spirit and when he hears the commandments of the law of God he shakes inside because he knows how terribly he's violated the word he knows he can't keep the standard both behaviorally and attitudinally inner attitudes God says you want to know who I'm saving you want to know who's getting into my kingdom you want to know who's coming to the kingdom of God is the person who is humble and contrite of spirit impoverished in other words saying I have nothing to offer and who trembles at the word as you might expect the scribes and the Pharisees were very offended by this message they bristled they had been giving their life to trying to earn the kingdom of God on their own merit and Jesus said you can't do it you're not that good you're not that holy you're not that righteous and in fact the only people that get into my kingdom are the people who can completely admit that and be broken over their own sin and over time they became more aggressive against him because his message was so convicting to them and they didn't want to believe what he was saying and as I said at the beginning of the message they eventually plotted how to kill him they wanted a silenced his voice they couldn't stand the notion that somebody was saying you can't earn heaven on your own merit but there was another crowd I talked about the ones that got hope for the first time there were a whole bunch of people there who were starting to take a deep breath for the first time in their life and they were kind of letting the spiritual pressure off their life saying oh you mean it's okay to tell God that I'm a sinner I don't have to pretend anymore I don't have to play a game with him I don't have to try to be something perfect so I can earn heaven I just have to admit to him that I'm a sinner they were starting to breathe a little easier they were starting to breathe a little more comfortable they were starting to say no more sense to me because I could never earn heaven let me just close with a little parable that our Lord told
[time=2942] you don't need to turn there but he was trying to get this concept across a little later on in his ministry and he told a story that represents real truth he talked about these two guys that were in the temple and the one guy was a Pharisee and the Pharisee was standing right there in the middle of all the religious center of that world right there in the temple right there in front of everybody and the Pharisee was reciting all of his accomplishments so that you and I could have heard it had we been there he was standing there literally saying and I did this and I've done this and I've done this and I haven't done this and I haven't done this and I haven't done this I mean right in the hearing of everybody it was his pride and his arrogance coming out and then he went on to pray this prayer he said I give thanks, oh God, in heaven that I am not like the sinful people and he pointed or gestured over to the tax-gatherer the lowest guy on the rung of spiritual prestige can you imagine?
[time=3006] He's standing there tapping his foot leaning up against the temple all garbed out in his religious stuff and he's just reciting all of his spiritual accomplishments and all that he's done and he prays to God thank you that I'm not like that sinner over there well that sinner over there
[time=3026] like I say Jesus said he's a tax-gatherer and Jesus said this guy was unwilling even to lift up his eyes to heaven he was so aware of his own sin and his own unacceptability to God that he wouldn't even look heavenward he wouldn't even gaze up towards the ceiling of the temple because he was so ashamed over his own sin so broken over his own inability to keep the law of God and then Jesus said he was beating his breast which was a physical gesture of mourning and concern over just how sinful he was and then he prayed this instead of saying I'm so thankful I'm not like the sinners he said this God be merciful to me for I am a sinner contrast pretty sharp let me tell you what every single person in this room right now is in one camp or the other
[time=3080] you may not be all the way over there with the Pharisees and the religious accomplishments but when you come to answering the question if I were to stand before God today and he were to say why should I let you into my kingdom every single person in this room is going to have basically one of two answers you're going to have the answer well I tried really hard and I know I'm not perfect but I did my best and I tried to fall the golden rule and I never committed murder and I never committed adultery and I did give to the church that one time and what you're saying is can't my good works please balance out my bad works and then on that basis can I get in?
[time=3116] or you're in another group you're in this tax gathers group and you're sitting there and you're going to say to God God I don't deserve to get to heaven I am so sinful you know how sinful I am oh and maybe I didn't commit murder but you knew the condition of my heart you knew the condition of my mind you saw all the things I've ever done you know how rotten I am oh God save me be merciful to me for I am a sinner give me something I don't deserve heaven now which group are you in?
[time=3148] which category are you in?
[time=3150] you're in one or the other to one degree or another let me finish the parable Jesus then said this the tax gatherer went down to his house justified rather than the other guy the Pharisee isn't that interesting?
[time=3169] Jesus said this on the heels of that comet for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled but he who humbles himself shall be exalted what he means there is if you are proud enough spiritually to think that you can earn heaven in light of who you are God says in the end I will humble you I will say bum by ash this kingdom of heaven is not for you but if you will humble yourself and admit to God that you don't meet his requirements that you never have and that you never could God says that's the guy that's the woman that comes into heaven there's a wonderful hymn that was written it's the one that I think expresses this very clearly listen to this it goes this way nothing in my hands I bring simply to your cross I cling naked I come to you for dress helpless I look to you for grace foul I to thy fountain fly wash me saviour or I die that's it right there that is what Jesus is saying on the Sermon on the Mount in a nutshell nothing in my hands I bring I have no spiritual resource I don't bring with me the accomplishments of my life because I know that they are invaluable they are of no value they make no contribution to the offenses that I have brought against the Holy God so I don't cling to my spiritual accomplishments he says nothing in my hands I bring simply to your cross I cling the only thing I'm hanging on to is the fact that you sent your son to die on my behalf to die in my place to pay the penalty for my sin goes on naked I come to you for dress I don't dress myself in my own religious accomplishments in my own personal righteousness in my own works of good deeds I come to you absolutely stark naked because I don't have anything to cover my sin with clothe me with the righteousness of Christ helpless I look to you for grace helpless I can't change my status I can't jump that high I'm helpless before it I fly foul foul to thy fountain I fly to you as a foul contaminated sin stained individual then I say please wash me underneath the fountain of Christ blood please wash him into the forgiveness of what he did on the cross or I'll die you hear there the heart of a person that God brings into the kingdom of heaven we're going to pray in a moment and I want you to know that the same mind-bending truth that our Lord taught 2,000 years ago is true today and I want to say to those of you who are in the group that are counting on your religious accomplishments you are not to be made fun of you are not to be insulted and I hope that this message doesn't do that I've endeavored to be clear to the best of my ability but you are in a position of danger you are in a position of danger because you are misunderstanding the kingdom of God and the requirements that are there and if you look at your life and feel a sense of relief and the ability to say God I am the sinner and I never could make that bar up there and I'm tired of trying and I want to cling not to my own accomplishments but to the fact that Jesus died for my sins when you commit your life to that truth when you give your life to that the kingdom of heaven is yours because Christ paid for it for you well let's stand for a closing word of prayer Father how many of us at one point or another in our life
[time=3420] are like the scribes and the Pharisees that view this thing like a balancing act between the good and the bad works how many who are here today believe that Father wrongly and maybe there are some who are offended by the words of Christ even today as they were so many years ago but maybe for some there is a dawning of hope maybe for some who are here today they're beginning to understand something about how you save people that they never saw before that it's not about works it's about what Christ did for us on the cross and for those who are beginning to think about that and where your spirit is touching their heart we pray that you would help them to assess their spiritual condition and honesty and that they might find a place of being broken in spirit over their own sin and if you're here today and you don't feel broken over your sin but you know you should over and over again and you heard some of it today God invites you to say God search my heart know my thoughts try me and see if there is any wicked way in me and I want to invite you to pray that prayer say God teach me how sinful I am show me how wicked I am so that I can in genuineness ask to be saved by the blood of Christ and finally we look forward to the days that are coming where we can understand more the truth that Jesus teaches about the kingdom of heaven and the people who will live there and we praise you and thank you for these things and all God's people say amen God bless you in a moment I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance you can also receive a cassette copy of today's message just ask for take number 1744 or mention the message by Pastor Moore entitled you need more than a good religion your gift of three dollars will cover the cost of the tape the financial gifts from the Bible Hour Founders Club help support this ministry if you'd like to join the Founders Club just write to us now here's our address the Bible Hour 7400 East State, Fort Wayne, Indiana this is Craig Volcker on behalf of Pastor Moore and the entire Bible Hour stamp and finding you to join us each week for the Bible Hour.
