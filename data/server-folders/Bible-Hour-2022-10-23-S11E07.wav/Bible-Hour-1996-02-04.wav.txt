[time=30] But in fact, those who have set happiness as the direct goal are the most miserable of
[time=47] all, because the most unhappy people on the planet are not the most who have the least in financial goods, who have the worst kinds of jobs, whatever those might be.
[time=56] The most unhappy people are not the most stupid people who might not be able to read or read or write or whatever their plight may be.
[time=62] The most miserable people in all the world are the people who have a compromised character and who have broken relationships.
[time=77] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=80] Thank you for joining us.
[time=82] Happiness is hard to find.
[time=84] Everybody seems to have their own ideas about what will make them happy.
[time=88] Everybody seems busy trying to flesh out those ideas in their lives, but few people seem really happy.
[time=93] Stay with us today as Jesus explains the path which leads to happiness.
[time=97] Now let's join our service.
[time=118] But when I think I'm all alone, and as my strength is gone, I will do nothing.
[time=203] I will do nothing.
[time=206] But when life has filled you with despair, just cast your load on Jesus Christ and give
[time=221] Him all your care, I go to God in prayer, He is always there.
[time=231] I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, He is there.
[time=248] He is my Torah strength, I refuse from despair, I go to God in prayer.
[time=258] I go to God in prayer, I go to God in prayer, He is always there.
[time=270] And now, my load is so much lighter, and now, my days are so much brighter.
[time=287] For since I have found a friend in Him, I give Him every care.
[time=294] I go to God in prayer, He is always there.
[time=301] I go to Jesus, I go to Jesus, He is there.
[time=318] He is my Torah strength, I refuse from despair.
[time=325] I go to God in prayer, I go to God in prayer, I go to God in prayer.
[time=337] I go to God in prayer, He is always there, He is always there.
[time=356] That is a great truth.
[time=359] To know that we worship the kind of God that no matter where we are, no matter what the circumstance, we can go to Him in prayer.
[time=365] And thanks for letting us have the opportunity to share our worship and our praise together with you as you watch the Bible hour today.
[time=371] I want to tell you about something else that has been going on in the life of our church.
[time=374] During the past couple of years, we have had a focus on sharing our faith with people that may not understand what being a Christian is all about, not only doing that together as a church, but encouraging our members and attenders individually to be doing that.
[time=388] Recently, during all the Super Bowl fever, we encourage the people to host Super Bowl
[time=394] parties in their own home and invite their neighbors or co-workers or family into their home just to have fun together and to build a relationship with the hopes that those people would see the reality of Jesus in their lives and in their families.
[time=408] Well, it was a real success and we had a number of reports back from people who made use of that event.
[time=412] And here's a letter from one family that invited some neighbors, neighbors that they had just started building a friendship with.
[time=419] And they said that they watched the game together and then after the game was done, conversation turned to other things, including church talk.
[time=426] And they said that we finally crossed the divide and entered into spiritual zone.
[time=430] The couple openly shared their church experience, one with which we could readily identify.
[time=435] Thank you for your encouragement and vision regarding the Super Bowl party.
[time=438] This was truly a unique and authentic approach to reaching friends for Christ.
[time=442] Well, that's the hard and passion of our church to share the gospel, to tell that good news to people that it's not religion, it's not denomination, it's not church per se,
[time=453] it's a relationship with the real living God.
[time=456] In fact, we feel so strongly about the need of the church to be more passionate in its pursuit of sharing the gospel with people that every third Sunday of each month we commit our morning service to that goal, sharing the truth of Jesus in very easy to understand
[time=472] ways during our morning service.
[time=474] We use drama, special music and the message is all focused around sharing truth of God with people who may not understand what that's all about.
[time=482] Well, for those of you in Fort Wayne watching the Bible Hour who may not attend church and maybe even have questions of your own, we encourage you to join us next Sunday, February 18th for our outreach service.
[time=492] Our course, our service times are at 910 and 1045 and we invite you to come and be a part
[time=499] of the service with us.
[time=504] [MUSIC][MUSIC] My baby, panting for the water [MUSIC][MUSIC] I was thirsty for so long [MUSIC][MUSIC] I was so dry [MUSIC][MUSIC] So I sailed out on my journey [MUSIC][MUSIC] I'm not sure what I'd find [MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=539] [MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=545] [MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=558] [MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC] [MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=580] [MUSIC][MUSIC]
[time=589] [MUSIC][MUSIC] I have searched this whole world over for the answer [MUSIC][MUSIC] Waiting just to fill this void inside [MUSIC][MUSIC] All the things that were material they could not satisfy [MUSIC][MUSIC] For my hunger ring was for the bread of light [MUSIC][MUSIC] Ooh, it came my man above above [MUSIC][MUSIC] I could never get enough [MUSIC][MUSIC] Living water, bread of light [MUSIC][MUSIC] Come and quench this thirst with it [MUSIC][MUSIC] Fill this hunger deep inside [MUSIC][MUSIC] For so long I have been empty [MUSIC][MUSIC] Nothing else would satisfy [MUSIC] You will own her what I need alone [MUSIC] Living water a bread of life [MUSIC] Living water a bread of life [MUSIC] Well, this morning we're on the topic of happiness.
[time=686] How to be truly happy.
[time=692] How to be truly blessed in the inner man.
[time=696] You know how to have a sense that life is worth living and that things that matter ought to matter.
[time=703] And there are really two competing views on this.
[time=707] I mean, there are two ways to approach this whole topic of being happy.
[time=713] You can either decide in your heart to go out and get happiness, pursue it with a vengeance.
[time=721] And if you're going to run along those lines, you're going to come to the thought or the notion that success brings happiness, or money brings happiness,
[time=733] or enough entertainment will make you happy, or fame, or self-expression, or the circumstances of your life will finally get right.
[time=740] There'll be that right person, and finances won't be a problem.
[time=744] Your job will be okay.
[time=745] And finally, you'll hit this place called happiness.
[time=749] I don't know if you remember it, but a new newspaper came out not too many years ago.
[time=754] I enjoy it to this day.
[time=755] I'm thankful for it.
[time=757] It's USA Today, the newspaper that has color pictures and color print and all that stuff.
[time=762] Our new heart was the man that invented, created, and saw that from nothing to its current status of incredible success.
[time=770] Al wrote a book called How to Make It to the Top.
[time=773] Actually, it was about how to make it to the top.
[time=775] The book was entitled Confessions of an S.O.B.
[time=777] It's interesting title.
[time=778] I don't know just why he gave it that title.
[time=781] Listen to some of his recommendations if you're going to be in the pursuit of success or happiness.
[time=785] Number one, be your own pitchman.
[time=789] Sell yourself.
[time=791] Attention does not come quickly to the humble and the patient.
[time=794] The meek may inherit the earth, but they will never inherit the executive suite.
[time=799] Lead a self-promotional life.
[time=801] Be your own pitchman.
[time=803] If you don't toot your own horn, who will?
[time=806] Secondly, he gives his sage-like advice.
[time=810] If you are going to make it to the top when niceness fails to do the job, try a little nastiness.
[time=818] Number three, never hesitate to steal somebody else's good idea.
[time=823] Number four, once you have attained success, you have no choice but to guard it.
[time=829] Because there is someone out there who wants what you have.
[time=832] Hoard, protect, cover your backside, he says.
[time=838] Number five, winning is the most important thing in your life.
[time=843] If you are going to make it to the top, you better realize it is going to take all consuming effort.
[time=850] Winning is the most important thing.
[time=855] He says you want to have happiness, you want to have success, you want to go to the top.
[time=859] This is how I did it and this is how you ought to do it.
[time=863] But you may remember from last week that the Bible would warn you,
[time=869] we want you to pause and give thought for a moment that people who set success as their primary goal or happiness as their primary goal, people who say I am going to go out and do what it takes to be happy, will always compromise two things.
[time=885] First of all, their own integrity.
[time=887] When you make up your mind to make your life happy, you have entered the domain of selfishness, and you may try to be happy through polite ways, but the underwriting current of your life will be about you, and it will cause you over and over again to compromise your integrity because you will be living a self-centered, selfish life.
[time=909] And though you may never rob a bank and though you may never murder someone, the underlying premise of your life will be about you, and it will lead you to compromise your integrity in a thousand different ways.
[time=922] And with that compromise of your integrity will come a second one, and that will be the quality of your relationships.
[time=929] And you will be in relationship with people, but it will always be about you.
[time=933] It will always be about this relationship somehow, bringing you the happiness you have said you will have.
[time=940] Listen to his words again, be your own pitchman.
[time=945] When niceness fails, try a little nastiness.
[time=949] Never hesitates to steal somebody else's good idea.
[time=953] What does this kind of advice do for a person's integrity?
[time=956] And what kind of a shambles does this kind of advice if properly applied leave your relationships in?
[time=963] I mean, the direct pursuit of happiness always leads to selfishness and selfishness always destroys your integrity and your relationships right along with it.
[time=974] What we pointed out last week is that those who set happiness as the primary goal end up being the most miserable of all people on the planet.
[time=984] They are more miserable than anyone else.
[time=987] They have a misery all their own as they have the misery of a compromised personal integrity and they have the misery of broken relationship and those two things haunt you wherever you go and whatever you do.
[time=999] There is never any escaping either of them.
[time=1005] So the question that arose is, well, then what do we pursue?
[time=1008] I mean, it's not wrong to be happy, is it?
[time=1010] The Bible says no. In fact, the sermon on the Mount.
[time=1012] The one we're going to look at in a minute says happy are you.
[time=1015] Nine times it says happy are you.
[time=1017] The opening sentence of the opening message of the greatest preacher who has ever lived, the person of Jesus Christ opened it with the word happiness.
[time=1025] There's nothing wrong with wanting or longing to be happy, and there's nothing wrong with being happy.
[time=1033] You say then how do we pursue? What do we pursue?
[time=1037] What can we go after if we can't place happiness as the direct goal?
[time=1041] What can we throw our energies into?
[time=1044] And Jesus gives you eight things, and they are found in Matthew 5, if you wanted to turn there this morning.
[time=1050] Matthew 5, 6, and 7 are the record of the sermon on the Mount, the first message that Jesus ever gave that we have recorded anyway.
[time=1058] He'd preached before that, but this is the first one that's recorded for us.
[time=1063] And he says nine times happy are the poor in spirit, and happy are those who mourn, and happy are those who are gentle, and happy are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, and happy are the merciful, and happy are the pure and hard, and happy are the peacemakers, and happy are those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness.
[time=1080] Now these are not eight different kinds of people.
[time=1084] These are not different kinds of characters or temperamented people with different personality types. There's the poor in spirit personality type, and then there's the gentle personality type.
[time=1092] That's not what he's doing. He is describing the values and the character and the pursuits of a believer, of a person who is a Christian, of a person who would say, no, I reject the notion that happiness is bound up in success and money and wealth and circumstantial blessing.
[time=1110] I'm going to follow the wisdom of this particular sage, the person of Jesus Christ, who happens to be in the happiness business.
[time=1119] And he tells me not to strive after happiness itself, but to strive after different things and the surprise consequence of my pursuit of those things is I end up happy.
[time=1130] It's an altogether different way of seeing things.
[time=1134] It's an altogether way of approaching things.
[time=1137] It's a completely different way of living, and it is contrary to common thought in his day and in his culture as it is in ours.
[time=1145] It is radical. It is transforming. It is apparently backwards.
[time=1152] So what can we pursue? He began in verse 3 with the first of the Beatitudes by saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." And just by way of a brief review, you remember poor in spirit is to recognize that you are without spiritual resources to meet the spiritual obligations that you have.
[time=1169] God is holy and righteous, and we, to the best or the worst of our ability, we fail to live to a standard of perfect righteousness, so there is a debt, a spiritual debt that we have against the holiness of God.
[time=1183] And we look to the spiritual resources of our life.
[time=1186] We can't write checks that are big enough to pay the debt service on the debt of our unholyness against the righteousness of God.
[time=1193] And he says the happy person is the one who can finally admit that, the one who can finally stop trying, the one who can finally acknowledge that they are sinful and without spiritual resources, to cry out to God for salvation to the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=1208] There is the beginning of happiness.
[time=1210] There, in fact, is the beginning of a true relationship with God.
[time=1215] A person who doesn't come to that acknowledgement, a person who doesn't confess that profound level of spiritual poverty can never be saved, can never go to heaven, can never be in right relationship with God.
[time=1227] This is the beginning of walking with God, the point of being broken and poor in spirit.
[time=1234] And you're happy when you get that way, because you finally admitted what you were refusing to admit.
[time=1239] You finally given up the battle you could never win, to try to earn the pleasure of God, and you just fall limp in the grace of God and say, "I can't do this. Would you do this for me?" And he says, "Yes, I did it in my son, Jesus Christ who died for you." And the happiness begins.
[time=1252] Maybe for the first time in your life, a real profound sense of happiness.
[time=1258] He goes on in the next beatitude.
[time=1261] He says, "This sounds strange." "Happy, are you who mourn?" So that's a paradox.
[time=1267] Well, to mourn is not some type of obsessive sadness
[time=1274] over the dreams in your life that didn't come through or the hardships that you've gone through, and we do have dreams unfulfilled and we do have hardship, and it is a blessing of God to be able to cry and release the emotion, and it is cathartic in itself, and it's nothing wrong with that.
[time=1290] But that's not what he means when he's talking about mourning.
[time=1294] He is talking about mourning, and he is describing the responsible, legitimate, and very appropriate sadness that we feel in our hearts over our own sin before God and the damage that we've done to other people.
[time=1308] Remember last time we talked about the most dangerous of all criminals is the one who can murder and maim and rape and kill and feel nothing inside?
[time=1316] They don't feel a twinge of guilt.
[time=1318] Those are the ones that our law enforcement agencies are working most, you know, effort, with full effort to get them off the street because they are lethal.
[time=1327] And so would we be if we could stand before a holy and a righteous God knowing all that we have done and all the ways that we have sinned against them and feel nothing and mitigate it and come up with language that tries to minimize our sin instead of saying, "You know what, I mourn.
[time=1340] I mourn to the core of my being that I have been this sinful in your presence and have hurt the people in my world as I have." That isn't ill health, that's wonderful health, and you're happy when you can do that.
[time=1354] There's a sense of joy that fills the soul when you can finally take full responsibility for your own action and mourn the result of it in other people's life.
[time=1364] It's just like getting wings and you can fly for the first time in your life.
[time=1370] And then he said in the next Beatitude, "Blessed are the gentle." And remember that didn't mean weak or cowardly or timid or even shy.
[time=1380] To be gentle it means power under control.
[time=1384] Power, enormous power under control like a strong stallion who has been broken by a careful rider
[time=1390] and now what was untapped, unharnessed, irresponsible power is now brought into a constructive use and it's a thing of beauty.
[time=1399] Like a medicine that if left undiluted in its strongest most potent place would kill the patient, not heal the patient, there's a power that must be harnessed
[time=1410] and brought appropriately to bear on the issue inside that diseased person and then comes healing in life.
[time=1417] And so it is with a human being we have been given by God.
[time=1420] By the very virtue of being created in his image we have power to choose and to set a plan and to strategize and to think and to set a course.
[time=1430] And Jesus says you're only truly happy when you take that intrinsic power and you break it underneath the will of God to where you begin to ask the question how should I live today, what would please God, what would honor God?
[time=1445] Then your power is harnessed, it is called gentleness and you begin to experience the wonder of life.
[time=1451] And my friends it's a happy place.
[time=1454] It's a happy place, you leave behind you much of the misery of uncontrolled misdirected power
[time=1460] and the choices that you would make outside the will of God and the consequences that you would bring into your life.
[time=1466] You can leave vast amounts of that behind you and begin to experience the reward
[time=1472] of living harnessed under the will of God.
[time=1477] Well that's where he began, that's what we talked about and now today he gives some more.
[time=1483] But the composite picture to this place is one of a happy person because he is spiritually bankrupt and acknowledges it and has accepted the grace of God.
[time=1492] A happy person because he rightfully legitimately mourns over the consequences of his sin to God and the people in his life.
[time=1498] And a happy person who has begun to harness his power underneath the will of his father.
[time=1505] And now verse 6, the happiness goes on.
[time=1509] The happiness goes on, he says in verse 6, "Happy are you who hunger and thirst for righteousness
[time=1515] for you will be satisfied." That's what we've been singing about this morning, that's what we've been talking about, that's what Kip sang about.
[time=1521] To be satisfied, maybe for the first time in his life as the song depicted.
[time=1526] To have tried all different kinds of sources where might satisfaction be found and all of them came up dry and empty, but finally he found satisfaction in God.
[time=1535] Happy are you who don't run around with an empty hole in your soul because nothing can fill it.
[time=1543] What kind of happiness is that?
[time=1546] Running from one thing to the next thing to the next thing, no, instead finding something finally that touches you deeply and leaves you with a full contented feeling.
[time=1556] And what is that, righteousness?
[time=1559] The Bible uses all kinds of metaphors, it's just a marvelous book, and it tries to help us move from what we know about to what we don't know about, to move from the known to the unknown.
[time=1567] Now we all know about hunger and thirst.
[time=1569] We all know how preoccupying it can be when we get truly hungry and truly thirsty and everything else seems to slip to the side until that issue is addressed.
[time=1578] And what he is saying is that inside the human heart and the human soul, by virtue of the way we were created,
[time=1585] there is much like a physical hungering and thirsting.
[time=1590] There is a spiritual hungering and thirsting.
[time=1595] Never once does God ever condemn the fact that we hunger and thirst, that there is this whole, that there is this desire to find, he never once condemns that.
[time=1604] That is intrinsic to being a human being.
[time=1608] What he cautions us about is about trying to satisfy the hunger and thirst of the soul with illegitimate things.
[time=1618] If you can, come with me to Isaiah 55 and keep a finger there in Matthew 5.
[time=1624] And you don't have to come here, I'll read it to you, but if you'd like to see it, it's here.
[time=1629] In Isaiah 55, the Lord is taking the pose of a street vendor, a common, ordinary, everyday street vendor
[time=1638] who is found in a symposium, a marketplace of sorts.
[time=1642] And you can see it in your mind's eye, it would be an open door marketplace and there would be people up and down this very busy thoroughfare and there would be different kiosks where different items would be sold, pottery and clothing and food and whatever, animals, I mean you can see the busyness of the day.
[time=1660] And the Lord takes his position in the marketplace of life as a common salesman and he hails the passerby.
[time=1669] He says in Isaiah 55.1, "How every one who thirsts come to the waters and you who have no money come by and eat,
[time=1679] come by wine and milk without money and without car." And it must have been a startling thing for the people to hear this.
[time=1687] I mean first of all he appeals to the hunger and the thirst and then he says you can find satisfaction here
[time=1694] and you don't have to have money.
[time=1697] It's a free gift is what he's saying.
[time=1700] What I can give you in terms of soul satisfaction you cannot pay for and you cannot buy it, I can only give it to you.
[time=1707] Interesting kiosk, interesting salesman, interesting approach.
[time=1713] And to try to help people have a sense of an awareness, their need for what he happens to want to give them, not sell them.
[time=1722] He says in verse 2, "Why do you spend your money for what is not bread and your wages for what does not satisfy?"
[time=1730] He says, "Why are you out and about in the endeavors of life and you're spending your hard earned money
[time=1737] for things that are not truly bread, they look like bread, they promise satisfaction, they promise meaning, they promise purpose,
[time=1745] they promise blessedness, but you know by now my friend," he says to the passerby, "you bought that stuff before
[time=1752] and you're as hungry and as unsatisfied to the core of your being today as you were the day you bought it."
[time=1758] "Why do you do this?" "Retorically," he says, "what is it inside of you?" "When will you come to your senses and recognize the emptiness and the utter futility of trying to fill the soul
[time=1770] and the hunger and the thirst that drives you day in and day out with things which do not satisfy?"
[time=1779] She says this, "listen carefully to me and eat what is good, and delight yourself in abundance
[time=1788] incline your ear and come where to me," the Lord says, "come to me."
[time=1797] He says, "in effect I am the living Lord, I am the bread of life," as Kip saying, "I am the water of life,
[time=1804] I am the very source whereby your hunger and your thirst can be quenched and there is no other source,
[time=1811] there is no other place, all of it masquerades as satisfaction and all of it leaves you more hungry and more thirsty the next day than the day before."
[time=1823] Back to Matthew 5.
[time=1826] Happy are you when you hunger and thirst for righteousness.
[time=1837] There is a place that you come to in your life, at least at the point of salvation, and then by God's grace I think we return to it over and over again.
[time=1846] I don't know that it's a regular cyclical thing, it's too dynamic for that, but there is seasons of life where we forget the reality that the Lord is communicating in this beat attitude.
[time=1858] We forget that it's emptiness out there, that it's emptiness in success, that it's emptiness in achievement,
[time=1864] that there's emptiness in material things, that there is emptiness in circumstantial bliss, and that, by the way, is a myth.
[time=1870] We forget that, and there, by the way, is nothing wrong with achievement and education and wealth.
[time=1874] I'm not saying that, it's the pursuit of that to fill the soul. We forget, see?
[time=1878] So we go after it all over again. We buy into the lie all over again, and we begin to think in our minds very irrationally that we will be happy if this or that or this or that.
[time=1891] But then by God's grace we come back to a place where because we are poor in spirit and we are mourning our sin,
[time=1898] where the very sin that deceives us loses its deceptive power.
[time=1904] And it's as if the dawn is breaking and we can see that sin for what it really is.
[time=1909] It is emptiness, it is hollow, it is a lie. There is nothing there.
[time=1917] And sin at that moment loses its power over our life.
[time=1923] Like the woman at the well who tried so many different times with so many different men, and yet she came back to the Lord and said, "How do I solve the problem in my soul?" Like the great religious Nicodemus, who in his own self-righteousness tried to solve the problem of his soul
[time=1939] and had ascended to heights of spiritual dedication in a works righteousness system that would dazzle your mind
[time=1945] and yet he sought the Lord out in the middle of the night and said, "Oh Lord, tell me how to solve the problem in my soul."
[time=1953] Like the rich young ruler who had education and degree and reputation and money until he could have no more,
[time=1959] but he sought out the miracle worker and said, "How come all that doesn't satisfy my soul?"
[time=1967] Like the great king Solomon who had more of this world's goods and wives and cattle and horses and money
[time=1973] he was so rich they cleaned his doorstep with butter, which I imagine made it rather slippery.
[time=1981] But that was a joke, okay, you can laugh.
[time=1986] I mean he came to it all, he did it all, he tried it all, he went the full distance with all of it and came up saying one simple word to describe the whole experience, empty.
[time=1996] Vanity, vanity, the prodigal son asked him what it gave these other pursuits.
[time=2004] He tried, he took his father's fortune, he spent it all with wild living and alcohol and women
[time=2011] and carousing and everything that he could buy. I mean he had more money, but he finally came to his senses.
[time=2017] He said, "What am I doing out here? I'm empty."
[time=2023] There comes a point in our lives where sin gets seen for what it truly is.
[time=2029] It loses its deceptive power and then we begin to do something wonderful.
[time=2033] We begin to conduct experiments with righteousness.
[time=2037] Happy are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. We begin to experiment briefly at first, maybe just in an episode, maybe just in a relationship, maybe just for a day, maybe a week, maybe a month.
[time=2048] We begin to try to get right with God and people to live out rightness, righteousness.
[time=2056] We experiment with righteousness and we find there is this intrinsic value that begins to flood our soul called satisfaction.
[time=2063] We feel right about ourselves. We feel as though the pieces of our soul are getting brought back together,
[time=2069] we'll be getting to get whole again.
[time=2072] The soul begins to mend and integrity has a feeling and an energy all of its own.
[time=2079] We experiment with righteousness, we begin to see that relationships are taking on a new meaning,
[time=2085] words like real trust and honor and commitment and vulnerability.
[time=2094] We begin to taste of the byproducts of righteousness and the satisfaction that comes.
[time=2099] And over time these little experiments grow into a deep passion for righteousness.
[time=2106] We begin to seek righteousness with the same fervor and preoccupation that a person would seek for food and water if hungry or thirsty.
[time=2114] The seeking for righteousness becomes regular, it becomes intense and the satisfaction it brings becomes very enjoyable.
[time=2123] And over time you find yourself making vows about righteousness.
[time=2129] You say I vow in my heart never to sin like that again.
[time=2134] I never want to go back into that lifestyle.
[time=2137] I never want to retreat back to that kind of thinking and that kind of behavior because righteousness is so satisfying
[time=2143] and that is so empty.
[time=2146] Over time you find yourself making vows to strengthen your will towards righteousness.
[time=2151] To build hedges of protection in your life to guard for righteousness sake.
[time=2155] To bring people of accountability into your life for righteousness sake.
[time=2160] And verses like do not love the world nor the things in the world that used to sound somewhat negative and critical now become springs of life to you and you say you're not kidding I don't want to love the world and I don't want anything in the world they become verses that are positively impacting your soul.
[time=2177] Over time you'll even begin to make whole big time life decisions on the criteria of righteousness and how to make sure it stays in your life.
[time=2185] You'll come to big crossroads of the life about which education to pursue and you'll ask yourself
[time=2191] can I grow in righteousness down this road or will this road take me away from righteousness?
[time=2195] Will the circumstances surrounding this decision destroy my commitment to be righteous right with God and right with people?
[time=2201] You'll find that career decisions are being evaluated very carefully in light of your ability to walk righteously.
[time=2209] And some opportunities that may compromise your faith some opportunities that may push you in positions where you're not strong enough to stand though they make you more money you will say no to because you value righteousness over the advancement.
[time=2222] And some of you will begin to make decisions about a life mate based not on their appearance, based not on their personality, based not on their money or whatever other criteria but those are important
[time=2234] there will be a fundamental criteria that is at the base of all of it.
[time=2238] Is this person someone with whom I can seek righteousness?
[time=2244] Righteousness will become a preoccupation and a passionate focused desire of your life and you will be happy.
[time=2253] Psalm 107 says this, "For God has satisfied the thirsty soul and the hungry soul has been filled with what is good."
[time=2263] Do you realize that there are thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of people who have come to God seeking the righteousness of God through Jesus Christ who have had their soul satisfied?
[time=2273] None of them experiment folks.
[time=2276] Psalm 34 says the young lions do lack and suffer hunger. I mean even the strong and the ferocious at times lack and suffer hunger.
[time=2284] But they who seek the Lord shall not be in a want of any good thing.
[time=2289] God longs to satisfy your heart.
[time=2293] The Lord is my shepherd Psalm 23. I shall not want. I shall not want.
[time=2299] Thou dost prepare a table before me. My cup overflows.
[time=2307] You want to be happy? Don't pursue happiness. Pursue righteousness.
[time=2313] Pursue it with a vengeance and a preoccupation and a focused desire.
[time=2318] And for some of you you just need to experiment right now in your life.
[time=2321] You just need to take a little time to experiment with righteousness.
[time=2325] Just try it. Just take an area of your life and just experiment a little bit with righteousness.
[time=2331] And you tell me when you're done if it doesn't leave you with an entirely different feeling inside than does sin.
[time=2338] And over time you let that grow into a passion.
[time=2347] Verse 7, there's another beatitude here. It says blessed are the merciful.
[time=2352] For they shall receive mercy. Now mercy is an incredible concept.
[time=2357] Mercy is the ability to feel concerned for people who are in a miserable condition.
[time=2365] And it comes from having been shown mercy.
[time=2369] You can become a merciful person. You can begin to look at other people's situations and have real gut-felt sense of compassion
[time=2376] for their misery because somebody or someone has shown you mercy.
[time=2382] You get it shown to you and suddenly you're different than you're willing to show it to somebody else.
[time=2389] And of course we have been shown mercy, haven't we?
[time=2392] Because God looks at us in our miserable condition, lost in our sin and helpless to change our status.
[time=2398] But he doesn't stay removed in wrath and anger and indignation. He incarnates his own son as an act of his mercy
[time=2407] and then sends his son to the cross to die for us, which was our only hope to go from a miserable condition to a blessed condition.
[time=2416] We of all people have experienced a level of mercy that is immeasurable.
[time=2422] And Jesus says if you want to walk in happiness, if you want to walk and experience the happiness of life, then extend it to other people.
[time=2432] Mercy becomes the spontaneous reaction to someone else's mercy in your life.
[time=2437] I remember our first anniversary, our first anniversary there, we were broke.
[time=2443] We were just absolutely flat broke, didn't have any money at all.
[time=2447] Now by our first anniversary we already had our little daughter Randy because we had gotten pregnant there five weeks into our marriage.
[time=2456] And she had a whole set of expenses associated with her and we were broke.
[time=2461] And I of course was in seminary and I was on staff at the church there as a part time making very, very little money.
[time=2467] And did I mention that we were broke?
[time=2470] We didn't have any money at all, man. We were just hand to mouth. In fact we were selling stock that had been given to us by grandparents and ages gone by in an extra car just to try to make it through the deal, you know.
[time=2483] And somebody showed us mercy. It was the Sunday of our anniversary and we hadn't told anybody about our anniversary and we hadn't put out little feelers and we were just kind of going along our merry way.
[time=2493] And church was over and we went to the nursery to pick up Randy and there was her diaper bag and Heidi opened the diaper bag at a later point to get something out of there and there was this envelope in there.
[time=2503] And it just said Russ and Heidi, happy anniversary and then you open it and inside was a nice little car and 20 bucks.
[time=2509] It was a windfall, I mean we'd won the lottery.
[time=2512] We had absolutely no ability whatsoever to do anything that night from a financial standpoint in terms of our anniversary.
[time=2519] And you know what, it wasn't the fact that we got to go out and we went to this fast food dinner thing and then we took in a movie together.
[time=2525] It wasn't the food, as you would imagine, it wasn't the money. We just felt bathed in somebody else's love.
[time=2530] We just had the greatest time because we walked around feeling special that night.
[time=2535] Somebody had taken the time to look into our situation and be moved emotionally by our situation and give us something to help us.
[time=2546] That's what mercy is. Mercy is when you think about another person's condition, whatever the situation may be, but you don't recoil from their situation.
[time=2556] You don't justify their situation, buy their mistakes or buy their sins.
[time=2560] Somebody could have said, well you know they never should have had that child so soon anyway and they should have been more careful.
[time=2564] They shouldn't be in seminary, you ought to get another job and there's no reason for them to have it to be struggling like this financially.
[time=2569] I mean you could have found a thousand reasons not to help us and someone would have been good ones.
[time=2573] But they didn't, they looked to the need and then they got moved about the need and they did something about the problem.
[time=2580] Now Heidi and I are a little bit different because of that experience.
[time=2587] I mean when Heidi and I run into financial situations and other people's lives, you know where we go in our minds?
[time=2594] We go right back to our anniversary, we go right back to that event and the many that have followed where others have shown us mercy.
[time=2602] And we say to ourselves, how can we sit idle?
[time=2606] How can we not take, look just a little something out of our resources and try to help that person.
[time=2612] Try to mitigate a measure of that misery.
[time=2614] Now obviously we can't do that for everybody in the whole world and the need is always greater than the ability, but when God touches our heart and says, man this one's for you, you better get involved in this one.
[time=2622] We go right back to the mercy that was shown to us.
[time=2626] And in a bigger context we go back to the mercy of God that saved us because we ought to be in hell right now burning for what we've done.
[time=2631] Happy people, happy, truly happy people can get in touch with that kind of stuff inside of them and can be moved into action
[time=2641] and they can see the fruit of their labor coming to bear.
[time=2645] Proverbs 11, 17 says this, the merciful man does himself good, but the cruel man does himself harm.
[time=2653] You want to be a cruel man, you want to do yourself harm, then just shut off the bowels of your compassion to the people in your world
[time=2660] who need your help.
[time=2662] You'll do yourself hurt every day you're alive.
[time=2664] All the while thinking that you're happily pursuing happiness, but you shut off mercy and you shut off a vital valve of life.
[time=2673] Open mercy and do yourself good.
[time=2677] That's why Jesus specifically commands us to feed the hungry and to clothe the naked and to help the poor and to visit the sick.
[time=2685] You know why he says that? He doesn't say that so we can go out and earn spiritual brownie points to somehow get to heaven some day.
[time=2691] Has nothing to do with earning salvation. He loves us and he knows that for us to be whole and complete and happy we have got to be getting involved with other people's problems.
[time=2702] From hearts of mercy.
[time=2706] Went to lunch this week with some buddies sitting there waitress man she was rude and she was short with us.
[time=2716] And she left us with the feeling that we were in convenience and she's pretty good at it.
[time=2721] And after a couple of deals like that she goes away and one of the guys appropriately says you know I think that she has forgotten that you earn your tip.
[time=2729] You know that's true and I mean there ought to be a sense of we're excited you're here love to serve you how can I help you and I hope you give me a big tip and that's the way that'll work.
[time=2737] She forgot all that. You've got all about that.
[time=2740] Now we were getting ready now we're entrenching ourselves emotionally we're just going to do her in man and she's going to be bad to us and we're going to be bad to her and we'll just see if she gets any tip at all we're just going to write this whole thing off.
[time=2750] And then one of the guys at the table said hey yeah she is a little she doesn't look a little worn out which is a different twist little worn out.
[time=2759] She doesn't look a little hard.
[time=2762] Then he said you know what happens if you know maybe she's single they're middle forties maybe she's all alone maybe the guy that you know she said I do with said I don't later on with somebody else's wife.
[time=2775] And maybe maybe the single lady maybe she's a single mom too I mean maybe she's trying to raise two or three kids.
[time=2781] And maybe a couple of them are in their teenagers and they're running all over this town getting all kinds of trouble with sex and drugs and the law.
[time=2787] I mean who knows what her kids could be involved in struggling as she may be.
[time=2792] And how do we know that the guy that's living with her now who said yeah I'll move in with you I'll help you with the kids and I'll help pay the rent and he's a zero he's a jerk he's worse than the first guy she married.
[time=2802] And he's way behind on his contribution maybe she's over her head in financial problem yeah she's a little she's a little worn out today isn't she.
[time=2810] See Mercy has the ability to get behind the facade of harshness and rudeness to try to have some idea maybe she's got some problems that make her that way.
[time=2821] Doesn't excuse her behavior maybe there's some things running around inside her heart and her soul today that make her a little less than congenial.
[time=2828] I just sensed all of us begin to soften us this guy began to talk we all just got soft.
[time=2833] Well we're jerks yep that's what we are don't treat us nice we'll just blow you off the planet.
[time=2846] And I found our joy come back I mean she was bugging us she was irritating well why don't she think she is wrecking our lunch.
[time=2851] All of a sudden it was like well we're okay we were back happiness compassion.
[time=2859] Let me ask you a question what was the last time you showed somebody mercy.
[time=2863] What was the last time you got somebody passed somebody's irritating characteristic.
[time=2867] Got into what might be fueling that stuff inside their heart and their soul and identified with it and said I don't want to help you.
[time=2874] Come on your side I'm not against you in this one. Happy happy are the merciful.
[time=2883] Now this verse 8 is just an absolute killer I've absolutely no idea what to say about it because it's impossible.
[time=2890] Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God.
[time=2896] Blessed are the pure in heart.
[time=2899] The Bible uses the word heart to describe your inner person your thoughts your motives your attitude and your will the seat of all that stuff is in your heart.
[time=2908] In other words all your decisions all your evaluations all your choices all that stuff the Bible says has it seat in your heart.
[time=2915] Now your brain and your mind play a role but it's all seated in your heart it's the inner you it's the real you.
[time=2921] And Jesus is saying be pure right there at the heart of who you are just go ahead and be pure another word pure it was used in terms of metals and it would describe an unmixed unalloyed undivided unadulterated metal it was just 100% pure.
[time=2937] And so Jesus is saying at the core of your being be pure.
[time=2942] Now I believe he's true when he says that you're happy when you're that way I mean you don't have any mixed agendas or motives you do what you say you're going to do because you really want to do it because it comes from the core of your being.
[time=2950] That is a that is a happy state that's not what's in question the question is what are we to do with our wicked hearts.
[time=2957] I mean what are we to do with the alloyed mixed contaminated thing inside of us.
[time=2965] Jeremiah said it this way the heart is more deceitful than all else it's desperately sick who can even understand it.
[time=2972] I mean here's a prophet of God that's lived with himself long enough to say I am sick and I don't even I'm so sick I don't know how to diagnose myself.
[time=2981] I mean my heart is capable of evils that astound me is what he is saying.
[time=2988] And I concur I mean you put my heart in there with his.
[time=2996] Jesus said for out of the heart come evil thoughts and murders and adulteries and fornications and thefts and false witness and slanders you know where all that stuff comes from.
[time=3006] You know where all the problems in our society come from you know where all the personal problems in your life come from they come from the heart.
[time=3014] The thing that most essentially defined you.
[time=3021] I mean we can be walking along with the Lord we can be rejoicing the Lord we can be trying to serve the Lord and all of a sudden almost without provocation.
[time=3029] The heart can begin to evidence itself and we can see sick attitudes we can say sick things to ourselves we can have sick opinions of other people and their behavior we can just go south so fast it's absolutely astounding.
[time=3043] And there we are left in a spiritual heap with the wickedness of our own hearts.
[time=3052] Now all I can do is say this to you David was known as a man after God's own heart and this is what he said.
[time=3058] He cried out to God oh God let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart the acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my rock and my redeemer.
[time=3066] He did not make a pronouncement I will make my heart right.
[time=3070] He did not make a pronouncement I will guard the words of my mouth and the meditations he cried out for help with his heart.
[time=3080] I think he sensed the enormity of the task and his utter inability to correct what was wrong with himself and so he went to God himself and said oh God please let the words of my mouth and the medit in other words help me.
[time=3093] He said in Psalm 26 examine me oh Lord and try me test my mind and my heart and he was saying God I invite you.
[time=3102] It's a standing and an open invitation oh God please be busy looking at my heart and the condition therein trying it and testing it and reproving it and correcting it and shaping it and molding it and changing it for your glory.
[time=3117] The only thing I notice to you on this one is you and I have to give God complete and total permission to do whatever he wants to do with the thing inside.
[time=3129] And it is a dangerous request I mean I should put a little small print on this one.
[time=3134] You know you say that and I'll be honest with you when the refiner works he typically works with what?
[time=3140] Fire you got to melt some things down you got to get the drawers to come off the sides and you want to look at a perfect example it was Job who was in good shape at the beginning of the book and the longer the trial went on the more vile his heart revealed itself to be and though he never cursed
[time=3156] and left God it showed just how conditionally really was just how deceitful and wicked his heart really was.
[time=3164] I mean you pray God changed my heart you know you open up the door there for some stuff but I think it's the only way to happiness.
[time=3173] I think it's the only way to happiness.
[time=3176] Look at verse 8 blessed are the pure and heart for they shall see God remember what Job said in the end of the book he said in the beginning I had heard of the but now I see thee.
[time=3186] Now I have seen thee as God purified his heart and took him through the enormity of the experience he went through it was God lovingly purifying his heart.
[time=3200] Let's close with this verse 9 peacemakers the last beatitude for today says this blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the sons of God.
[time=3211] Hebrews 12 14 says pursue peace with all people Romans 12 18 18 says so far as it is possible so far as it depends upon you be at peace with all men.
[time=3224] Let me just say it to you this way if your life is pockmarked or littered with conflict and anger and fights harsh words upset attitudes if you find yourself out of step and out of sink.
[time=3243] Please do not think yourself a mature person please do not think yourself a champion of truth and you're going to get it right and all these other people will finally figure out that you were right in the end.
[time=3256] Please understand yourself to be a remarkably immature and possibly unsaved person because conflict and anger and fights and harsh words whether internal or external are the marks of death and immaturity and Satan himself.
[time=3275] He is a fighter and he loves conflict. The born again believer and the growing saint which is why I think this finds its way towards the end of the beatitudes is someone who has learned how to make peace while they stand for their convictions and the truth that they believe.
[time=3295] And there is an aura about them and there is a way that it happens in their life that both inside the church and outside the church there is a pleasantness to them and a reasonableness to them.
[time=3306] They are under control and they are not caught in the conflict and the anger and the fights.
[time=3316] Those of us who are in the church I want to say two things one to those of us who are in the church about the church.
[time=3321] We need to say goodbye to our private battles, to our little skirmishes, to the slander, to the case building, to the campaigning, to the distrust and the division that goes on in your heart towards the people in this church or any other church.
[time=3339] Peacemakers my friends, peacemakers allow the Holy Spirit to so motivate you to the place that you say enough I'm burying the hatchet and it's over.
[time=3351] Whether it's with a spouse or a relative or a child find the courage and the character to be a peace so far as it depends on you.
[time=3363] The second thing I wanted to say on this was about the unsaved, you realize that the 2nd Corinthians 5 says we have, you and I, you and I, we have been given the ministry of reconciliation that word means taking two people who are at odds and making them at peace.
[time=3376] And the people who are at odds are God in His holiness and the unsaved people that you know and they are at war my friends and God is winning and He will win and He will always win and it means death and destruction and damnation for the people that you know.
[time=3388] And a son of God the people who are going to be known or called the sons of God are the ones who work and strive at doing whatever they can as limited as it is to bring peace in that relationship with that person and their God.
[time=3402] They long to see it happen and so they spend time in relationship and they spend time in the points of crisis and they live a godly and pleasant life before those people because they're absolutely committed to somehow finding a way to introduce that person to the Lord.
[time=3417] To the Lord of peace, Jesus Christ, peacemakers.
[time=3422] We just go about our business making peace and it's scary business and it's humiliating business and it's courageous business but it's our business.
[time=3434] We are peacemakers.
[time=3437] So, happy are the poor in spirit, happy are those who mourn, happy are the gentle, happy are the people who are hungering and thirsting for right living.
[time=3450] Happy are the people who are looking deeply into other people's lives and giving resources to meet the misery.
[time=3457] Happy are people who are asking God oh please do whatever you must do to purify my wicked and sick heart.
[time=3463] And happy are the people who are agents of peace both in the church and outside the church.
[time=3471] Our gracious God and Heavenly Father we thank you again for the privilege of coming back to set our compass again to the truth of your word.
[time=3479] We confess that we are so easily misdirected we begin to mentally buy into things which are half-truths or no-truths that all we set courses for happiness that lead to misery.
[time=3490] We come back and we hear the sound profound clarity of the words of Jesus Christ.
[time=3496] And we resonate in our hearts with His truth and we ask only this morning that you would help us to live it.
[time=3505] Help us to live it.
[time=3507] For your glory and for your honor in Christ's name amen.
