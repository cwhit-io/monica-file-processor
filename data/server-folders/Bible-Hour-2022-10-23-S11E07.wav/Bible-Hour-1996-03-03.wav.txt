[time=36] [beep] And he's saying to the church at Corinth, let me encourage you with some other believers who are actually in the habit and the practice of giving financially to the Lord.
[time=52] Rather than just laying out some principles you ought to give, you ought to give regularly, you ought to give from the first fruits, you ought to give sacrificially, and just letting those kind of lay there on the page.
[time=61] I want to tell you about some flesh and blood people who are over in Macedonia, their fellow believers, let me tell you how they give.
[time=70] And maybe in seeing their example, you'll be encouraged to consider some principles for your own life.
[time=76] And so that's what we want to do this morning.
[time=78] [MUSIC]
[time=85] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=89] Thank you for joining us.
[time=90] Many people tend to view giving to the church as paying a debt to God, much like paying the tax debt to the government, or the mortgage payment to the bank.
[time=98] But the Bible gives a completely different perspective.
[time=101] Stay with us today and find out what it is.
[time=103] Now let's join our service.
[time=105] [MUSIC]
[time=120] Praise the Lord, he is great to be praised.
[time=127] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=136] Praise the Lord, he is great to be praised.
[time=143] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=150] Praise the Lord, he is great to be praised.
[time=158] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=166] Praise the Lord, he is great to be praised.
[time=173] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=183] When I think of His loving kindness.
[time=191] In the midst of His holy people.
[time=199] I will live my hands and brothers.
[time=213] Praise the Lord, he is great to be praised.
[time=220] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=228] Praise the Lord, he is great to be praised.
[time=236] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=244] I will live my voice, I will sing to the Lord.
[time=252] I will walk with my eyes.
[time=256] I will dance in the light, light, light.
[time=265] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=294] He is great to be praised.
[time=297] In the mountain of His holy hell.
[time=307] Praise the Lord.
[time=313] If you would take your Bible and come with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 8.
[time=324] And what is so interesting about this is that as Tim has mentioned the Apostle Paul believes in this kind of encouragement to give.
[time=334] In 2 Corinthians chapter 8 he is of course addressing the church at Corinth.
[time=340] And they are under enormous persecution and they are literally starving to death.
[time=347] You say why is that?
[time=348] Well because when a Jew accepts Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior, this would be true there today as well, but particularly in the first century.
[time=358] And you tell all your friends and you tell all your family that you now believe in the person of Jesus Christ, that he was the Messiah.
[time=366] Well they began to ostracize these Jews and they were losing their businesses, they were losing their contacts, they were losing their ability to make a living.
[time=376] And what they would do when they couldn't make a living, what you and I would do typically is we would go to our family and we would say, can we live with you?
[time=383] Would you shelter us?
[time=384] Would you provide hospitality?
[time=386] But the zeal of the Jews who were not converted led them to turn their own family members out.
[time=395] And so they were saying to a brother or a sister, a fellow Israelite who had accepted Christ, not only do we not care about you, you can't live with us, we will not help you, you are dead to us.
[time=408] And so you had this group of believers right there in Jerusalem who had absolutely nowhere to turn.
[time=414] They had no money, no family, and the only friends they had were fellow believers in Christ who were suffering the same circumstances.
[time=422] And so they were in abject poverty.
[time=426] And the apostle Paul knows of this and he cares about it.
[time=430] And so he is writing to now a second church, the church at Corinth, and we're going to read what he says to them in just a minute.
[time=437] And he is making an appeal to them to say, hey, would you guys be willing to help support these poor believers down in Jerusalem?
[time=445] And in making that appeal to the church at Corinth, he says, and let me do that by way of telling you about a third church, a church over in Macedonia, and you would know them as the Philippians, the Thessalonians, and the Bereans.
[time=459] And he is saying, hey, you guys here in Corinth, you can do this.
[time=462] You can actually pull this off.
[time=464] You can give in ways that maybe you had never given before and to help you get a little insight, to get some motivation, to get a heart for the thing.
[time=472] Let me tell you about how some fellow believers over in Macedonia are doing it.
[time=476] And that's our objective this morning.
[time=478] Let's you and I, two thousand years later, learn from some people who lived in Macedonia and who were giving.
[time=484] And by that, kind of learn a biblical pattern for how we should give.
[time=488] And I'll just give you four perspectives or four parts of their example this morning.
[time=492] And the first is this.
[time=494] The Corinth, the Macedonians gave, when they gave their money, they gave in response to the goodness of God.
[time=502] Look at verse one, 2 Corinthians 8-1.
[time=505] Now brethren, we wish to make known to you the grace of God, which has been given in the churches of Macedonia.
[time=513] What he is saying is, the stuff that the Macedonians did was in evidence that the grace of God was alive and active in their church and in their personal lives.
[time=523] Now, enough of you have grown up in churches and religious systems, where giving was defined for you as a way to try to get into heaven.
[time=535] There are churches all over this city and all over this country and all over this world in various forms and shapes that are telling their people that if you want to get into heaven, if you want to be forgiven for your sins,
[time=548] if you want to have a happy nirvana or a happy afterlife, it's incumbent upon you to give and to give faithfully, to give regularly, et cetera, et cetera, as a means of acquiring an entrance into the kingdom of God.
[time=562] And my friends, I'm happy to tell you that the Bible never teaches that thought, never teaches that principle, it never even gets close to that.
[time=570] In fact, the exact opposite is true. These Macedonians were giving because of the grace of God had already penetrated their life.
[time=581] These are people who had been forgiven because they put their faith in Jesus Christ, not because they gave.
[time=587] These are people who had been forgiven of all their sins past, present and future and who were on their way to the glories of heaven and nothing could reverse that process simply because of the grace of God and they put their faith in the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=602] Now their giving, their actual giving, taking money out of their pocket and giving to the church was a response to that grace, not an earning of salvation but a small way to try to say thank you for all that God had already done on their behalf.
[time=618] But that's the first principle of giving. If you're here today and you're trying to give your way into heaven, then that's completely different than what the Bible teaches and that's completely different than what's in the hearts of these people as that offering plate goes through the aisle.
[time=631] We're giving in some small way to say thank you God for forgiving me for my sins, for making me inheritance with Christ where I possess everything and that I have eternity.
[time=642] That's what giving is really all about. It's a response to the goodness of God. You mentioned, you saw in the video there, Jane, and she was talking about the time when I was asking for some help as a church to try to get us to a crunch period and she felt she'd given enough and she likely had knowing Jane.
[time=660] I mean, she probably all squared away in her heart with God on how much she had given. But the Holy Spirit, I don't know how this works, the Holy Spirit just kind of prompts your heart or he prompts your mind and the notion something inside of you begins to say, you know what?
[time=677] I really want to do more than I've done. I really want to do something extra. I really feel led of God to give. That's how these Macedonians were giving.
[time=686] They were giving in response to the kindness and the grace of God as he was manifesting himself in their lives.
[time=693] Biblical giving is not some form of common human kindness. It is not human philanthropy.
[time=701] Biblical giving is not an effort to appease your own conscience or to try to rid yourself of guilt or to be seen by other people so you'll be noted as a giver.
[time=712] None of those motives are ever listed. The kind of giving the Bible talks about is when you are personally overwhelmed with the grace of God in your life that he loves you despite who you are, that his son died for you in security, eternity at no cost to you.
[time=727] When you want to respond to that out of a heart of gratitude you're giving like the Macedonians gave.
[time=734] Just exactly like that. And that's a privilege and it's an honor and it's a tremendous sensation to feel that dynamic going on inside of your heart as you reach for your checkbook, as you reach for your wallet and say, God thank you from the core of my being for saving me.
[time=753] Second principle, second principle, look at verse two, that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
[time=766] I want you to focus in on two little phrases in that verse, great ordeal of affliction. Do you see that? Great ordeal of affliction and then a little bit later it says their deep poverty.
[time=777] The second principle that we learn from the Macedonians is that they gave as a first priority. Their circumstances were incredibly difficult.
[time=787] They were living in an area of high taxes by Rome, very high rent, many of the Macedonians were slaves themselves and had very little money if any.
[time=798] They were also because of their faith, often under persecution. And so Paul describes them as being people of deep poverty. What that means is rock bottom destitution.
[time=810] The Macedonians themselves were in poverty. You see the little phrase ordeal of affliction? The word ordeal means to test metal in a furnace and the word affliction means to press or to step on grapes until they burst.
[time=827] That was their experience. They were daily under physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, financial affliction, the pressing until it breaks.
[time=838] They were living under enormous difficulty in their current circumstances. And yet that notwithstanding they gave.
[time=848] Now you only do that my friends, if you have made giving a high, maybe a top priority in your life. If you see it as a secondary issue, if you see it as well, we'll give if we have an exceptionally good year.
[time=862] Or we'll give if the miscellaneous expense part of our personal budget doesn't get expended, then you're a long, long way away from the biblical model that Paul holds up through the Macedonians.
[time=875] You know how easy it is to talk yourself out of giving. I mean imagine what these people could have been saying in Macedonia about the Jews and the Christian Jews in Jerusalem.
[time=884] They could have been saying, you know, that's not our church. I mean, this is our church right here. We ought to just take care of our church. Why should we care about that church?
[time=891] They could have done the racial thing. Many of these Macedonian believers were Gentiles.
[time=897] And they could have said, I'm not giving a bunch of Jews. I don't care whether or not they are saved. I don't care that they came to Christ.
[time=904] There could have been that racial problem and they didn't let that get in the way.
[time=908] There could have been, you know, that's not my city. That's not my church.
[time=912] You know, I'll tell you what those Jews ought to do down there in Jerusalem who came to Christ. They ought to get a job.
[time=916] That's the problem. If they just got a job, then they wouldn't have their problems and their financial needs to be met.
[time=922] And if they can't get a job in Jerusalem, well, get a clue. Move somewhere else where you can get a job.
[time=928] You know what will happen? If I give them money now, then I'll just support their perpetual point of need.
[time=934] They'll never solve their problem. I'm probably doing them a favor by not giving them any money.
[time=938] See? Especially you could hear them saying those things to themselves in light of their own deep poverty,
[time=945] in light of the fact that they are currently under an ordeal of affliction.
[time=950] Those kinds of excuses and rationales and reasonings would just fly into expression and they would not give.
[time=956] They'd tighten the strings on their purses, and they'd feel very justified in doing that.
[time=961] Now that's part of who we are, folks. I mean, that is part of the way that we can talk ourselves into keeping our money.
[time=969] Then what you find out about the Macedonians is that they refuse to allow the adversity of their own circumstances
[time=976] to prohibit them from fulfilling a priority that they had deep within their heart.
[time=981] And that was to be giving, giving to the cause of Christ.
[time=986] Let me give you a third principle. A third principle.
[time=991] It begins in verse two. The principle is this. They gave from their heart. Look at it.
[time=997] Verse two, that in a great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of what? Joy.
[time=1004] Their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
[time=1010] They were giving right from the core of their heart, and because of that, as they gave, they were being overflowed with personal joy.
[time=1019] The Lord said it is better to give than to receive. And he means that, and that is true.
[time=1025] It is far better that the rewards, the intrinsic rewards of joy and a sense of wholeness and a sense of integrity
[time=1032] and a sense of being right before God, the rewards are so much bigger on the giving side of the equation
[time=1038] than they are on the receiving side of the equation.
[time=1041] You want to know who gets really pumped in the give/receive equation. It's the giver.
[time=1047] Because you come to a place where you recognize, you know, God has blessed me.
[time=1051] I mean, sure, I've worked hard and whatnot, but I know there have been breaks in my life.
[time=1056] There have been certain innate talents. There have been certain things which have led to me being blessed to this degree.
[time=1062] God has cared for me. God has provided for me.
[time=1065] And now I have the privilege and the honor of taking from the abundance of what He has given me, and in the Macedonians case, the lack of what He had given them.
[time=1074] They still viewed it as abundance. And I recognize I am able, and I am willing, and I am desiring to give.
[time=1080] And that's a rush, friends. That is an emotional rush.
[time=1084] There is a joy there that you can hardly find anywhere else.
[time=1088] When you hear of a need, when you see a situation, and the Spirit of God begins to prompt your heart,
[time=1094] and you move your way through the thinking process, you know, how much can I give, and when can I give, and what form should I give it in, and all those kinds of things, but you finally get to the action point where you are going to write the check, where you are going to put the check in an envelope and drop it in the plate as it goes by.
[time=1111] As the drama, when that guy finally went to the bank and got that, whatever that house payment was that he gave to that dear lady,
[time=1117] and he got in his car and he popped it through the door, there is a sense of joy and excitement of being alive because you are giving to the cause of Christ.
[time=1128] That's a joy that comes and fills the heart.
[time=1133] I get a privilege of seeing that sometimes. I get the privilege, hopefully, of giving, as Heidi and I like to do, but I get the privilege of seeing, of being the receiving side of that from time to time, and I'll tell you for sure that the people in the process of giving, like this, are full of joy.
[time=1148] There's a situation not too long ago, we were in a living Christmas tree, and there was an individual out in the audience, and just like in the video where Jane said the Lord prompted, the Lord prompted this guy's heart.
[time=1159] And all I heard of it was, you know, I just felt like the Lord was telling me to give the Black Hawk Baptist Church, I just wanted to give.
[time=1165] So he went home. The next day he talked to his accountant, he talked to this person, that person, and finally asked for a check to be cut in the name of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=1175] Now see, there's an action point right there, and the joy is starting to build, and the excitement is starting to come,
[time=1181] and the thrill of being a part of this thing is starting to happen, because he's doing it from his heart.
[time=1185] On his way over here, he stops by a friend's place, and says, you know, the Lord's been leading me to do this,
[time=1192] and he's also leading me to ask you to match what I'm doing.
[time=1196] See, now there's a leading. There's a really good leading.
[time=1201] And he puts his check on the guy's desk, and I think I picked himself up and got back in his chair, because it was a rather sizable check.
[time=1207] And the guy says, yeah, you know what I want to do that too. So he got his checkbook, and he ran his check, and boom, right there in the pocket.
[time=1214] And then they get in their car, and they drive over here, and they walk in my office and shut the door.
[time=1219] I'm thinking, uh-oh. You know, I'm in trouble. What I do is they have a seat.
[time=1225] It was just unbelievable. Here they were two grown men, two successful guys doing battle in the marketplace every day of their lives,
[time=1232] having their emotions completely under control, bawling like babies, right in my office, as they with joy.
[time=1237] The tears were full of joy and the emotion, the sense of being alive. We get the help here. Take this.
[time=1243] Man, have you tasted that? Have you been a part of that? Has it been too long since you've tasted it?
[time=1249] It's an absolute thrill to give, as the Macedonians did, from their heart.
[time=1256] Well, it goes on. Look at this. In verse three, here's another indication that it was from their heart.
[time=1261] For I testify that according to their ability, now watch this, and beyond their ability, they gave of their own accord.
[time=1269] That little phrase gave of their own accord. The literal translation for the word accord means this.
[time=1274] One who chooses his own course of action. These Macedonians were not being coerced.
[time=1281] They did not allow themselves to be manipulated, or intimidated, or threatened, or bribed, or coddled, or tricked, or gimmicked in the giving.
[time=1289] None of that was their motive. They set their own course in their own heart.
[time=1294] They gave of their own accord, and that is exactly how God wants you to give.
[time=1299] That's another one of the great blessings I see attached to the ability to refinance our debt right now.
[time=1306] Because I'm thrilled to be able to be standing up here in front of you now. The church, of course, has needs.
[time=1311] But we're not, I don't want you to respond to this particular series out of a sense of crisis, out of a sense of being manipulated, out of a sense of, you know, if we don't do this, then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[time=1324] You and we, as a church, are in a position to respond to this series from our heart.
[time=1331] Because God has been so gracious to us, to save us, to respond from our heart, because we have made giving a first priority.
[time=1339] And we're going to give, even for some of us, in difficult circumstances right now financially, we're going to give anyway, because it's a priority to us.
[time=1347] Not because there's manipulation, not because there's coercion, not because there's a bribe going on.
[time=1354] Boy, there's something about that. You get to stand up as an image bearer and make a decision from your heart to say, I'm going to now part with the thing that the world loves most.
[time=1364] I want to give.
[time=1368] Look at verse 4, this will show you how much it was in their hearts to do.
[time=1371] The Apostle Paul says they began to beg us, begging us with much in treaty for the favor of participation in the support of the saints.
[time=1381] They held this thing as such a privilege and such an honor.
[time=1386] They're poverty notwithstanding, to be able to give and be a part of the collection that was going to be transported down to those saints in Jerusalem.
[time=1394] They began to beg the Apostle Paul for the privilege of doing that.
[time=1398] Man, the only time I, you know, you think, okay, when do people beg to get rid of their money?
[time=1402] Well, they beg to get rid of their money when they're going to invest in some incredible opportunity that may have huge returns.
[time=1409] See, that's revealing their heart. They valued, they valued making a difference in those believers' lives down in Jerusalem so much they didn't want to get left out.
[time=1420] It's like everybody's going to get together and have a great party and I want to make sure I'm on the invitation list.
[time=1424] Please, get me on the list. I've got to be there. Get me in the door. I don't want to miss this event.
[time=1428] That's exactly how they felt about their giving.
[time=1432] They valued helping those people. They valued honoring God with their money so much they began to beg.
[time=1438] For the privilege and the opportunity.
[time=1441] That's exciting. Now we're talking about giving.
[time=1445] Now you're seeing a model of giving that really inspires the heart.
[time=1449] Number one, they gave. They gave a response to the grace of God.
[time=1453] Number two, they gave as a first priority and never let their circumstances keep them from it.
[time=1458] Number three, they gave from the heart full of joy of their own accord, eventually begging for the privilege to give.
[time=1466] And lastly, number four, they gave generously and they gave sacrificially.
[time=1471] They gave generously and they gave sacrificially. Look at verse two again.
[time=1476] There's another word in there that helps us understand that.
[time=1479] It says, "In great ordeal of affliction, their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberati."
[time=1486] See the word overflowed? It overflowed. You know what that word was used in the Greek to describe a river at flood stage?
[time=1493] When finally the water was so swollen that the banks could no longer contain the flow and it goes up and over the banks.
[time=1501] They gave generously. They gave in ways that were beyond ways they'd ever given before in their life.
[time=1508] Their giving could not be contained by the banks of previous giving decisions.
[time=1515] They were so excited to participate. They were so committed to be a part of that thing that their giving community to rise and rise and rise until it spilled over the banks.
[time=1525] Going beyond what was their normal pattern. And then he says in verse three, "For I testify that according to their ability," now watch,
[time=1533] "and beyond their ability they gave of their own accord." They not only gave according to their ability, they then gave sacrificially.
[time=1541] They went beyond what they probably should have done. They gave till it hurt.
[time=1547] One commentator said they made a joy of robbing themselves. They were so committed, so excited.
[time=1553] The right hand stopped knowing what the left hand was doing and they started giving stuff they probably shouldn't have given to the point of personal sacrifice.
[time=1562] Well that raises the issue, okay? The question that always comes up on giving is, "How much should I give? How much should I give?"
[time=1570] Well let me give you this as an answer. The Bible, listen to this, the Bible never gives you a dollar amount, nor does it ever give you a percentage that you're obligated to give.
[time=1583] The Bible never gives you a dollar amount or a percentage that you're obligated to give.
[time=1590] We've heard of the tithe, which is 10%. The word means 10%. It's a mathematical term. It comes from the Old Testament.
[time=1596] And in the Old Testament, the Jewish, people of the Jewish nation were required to tithe. There were three of them actually. There were three tithes.
[time=1603] Two of them they had to pay every year. That gets you to 20%. One of them they had to pay over a period of three years.
[time=1609] So now you have 23 and a third percent and then there were a couple of others that brought them to a total of 25% that they had to tithe.
[time=1616] But I want to remind you that that was the nation of Israel underneath a theocracy where God was their king.
[time=1623] And so in reality, that was their tax. That money went to pay for the priests and the operation of the temple and the operation of the government, much like you and I pay our taxes.
[time=1634] And the New Testament says to us, "Pay your taxes," right? Romans 13, the example of Jesus. Render unto Caesar those things which are Caesars.
[time=1643] So like in the Old Testament, they were required to pay their taxes. You and I in the New Testament were required to pay our taxes.
[time=1649] But now there's a second kind of giving that goes on in the Old and the New Testament and it's called free will giving, free will giving.
[time=1657] And there's never an amount tied to it. It's always a matter of what is in your heart to give.
[time=1664] The great Old Testament example is Exodus 25 when God's going to build a tabernacle so that he can dwell among the people.
[time=1671] Listen to how he asked them to give and you listen for an amount and you listen for a percentage. He said this, "Tell the sons of Israel to raise a contribution." For me, he says. For God, God is speaking.
[time=1685] "From every man whose heart moves him, you shall raise my contribution." Ha, I didn't hear any percentage and I didn't hear any dollar amount.
[time=1697] Because I think what God's really looking for is for us to have hearts that are ready to be moved by the spirit of the living God and to respond to that not some arbitrary number.
[time=1707] You see, we're in a relationship with God. This is a dynamic and a fluid thing and he wants the expression of our heart to be individually determined as we would move to give in a way that honors him.
[time=1718] Now, the rest of the story on Exodus 25 is found over in Exodus 36 and God says to the leadership of the nation of Israel, he says, "Tell all the people to stop their giving because they gave so much that before they were done giving they already had too much to build the tabernacle."
[time=1736] See, they were mightily moved in their hearts, weren't they? It was a great day in the nation of Israel. It was a great day of worship and honor and God was blessed by their generosity.
[time=1747] Look at verse 5, they didn't just give their money and this, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God.
[time=1758] What else do they give? They didn't just give their money, they gave themselves. See, that's the act of worship.
[time=1763] We become Romans 12, 1 and 2, we become living sacrifices and we offer ourselves up every day.
[time=1768] We don't just give God our money, we give him our time, we give him our thought life, we give him our priorities, we give him our businesses, we give him everything we have, we say, "God, everything I have is yours."
[time=1776] From a living sacrifice, now there's a portion of it that I give to you in the form of money in a free will offering.
[time=1784] Look at verse 7, it wasn't just money that they were concerned to grow in, but just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you,
[time=1796] see that you also abound in the gracious work also.
[time=1799] I mean, that one testimony up there by Ray, I mean, why did he have to go and say that? I was having a great day.
[time=1804] You know, he says, you start at 10 and then, but get off that quickly and go, go, go, go, go.
[time=1809] Well, thanks a lot, just ruin my day. You know, now I got to go, go, go, go, go.
[time=1813] You feel inspired by that. You say, "Wait a minute, I not only want to grow in my knowledge of the Word, I not only want to grow in my ability to have knowledge of God, my earnestness.
[time=1823] I want to grow in every area of my Christian life." And what the Word of God says is, feel free to grow in the area of what you give as well.
[time=1832] Don't feel as though you need to hold that as certain percentage or rate or amount while you aggressively pursue growth in other areas of your life.
[time=1839] Grow as a total person and let your giving reflect that growth.
[time=1844] Interesting concept, isn't it?
[time=1846] Look at verse 8.
[time=1848] "I am not speaking this as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also."
[time=1855] Even as the video said, it's an expression of love.
[time=1858] We give because God wants us to give, we're commanded to give, then we never tells us how much, but giving is an act of love.
[time=1865] Sincerity comes from your heart.
[time=1869] So you say to me, "How much should I give? How much should I give?" If you want me to tell you what the Bible says, all I can say is this.
[time=1876] Pay your taxes and consider that a form of worship before God as you honor the authority that he's put in your life.
[time=1881] Secondly, give to the work of the Lord. You say how much? Well, two answers, give generously and give sacrificially.
[time=1888] Give generously and give sacrificially as the Lord lays it on your heart.
[time=1895] So that forces a whole new discussion between you and the Lord.
[time=1899] That gives all kinds of new growth opportunity for you to sit quietly someplace and begin to contemplate with your spouse potentially if that's appropriate to say,
[time=1906] "Hey, you know what? Have we been giving generously? Are we overflowing the banks?
[time=1912] And are we giving to a point that we would consider it sacrificial?" That's exactly how much you should give.
[time=1920] Well, you'll be happy to know that the church here in Corinth responded to the plea of Paul, to the need of the people in Jerusalem, and to the example of the Macedonians that they gave.
[time=1929] Needs were met.
[time=1932] Given response to God's goodness, give as a first priority, give from your heart, and give generously and sacrificially.
[time=1944] How are you giving?
[time=1946] I really want to bring this to a place of decision for you. I want to try to assist you here for a minute.
[time=1952] Some of you are going to be in this first category. You're going to need to set a start goal.
[time=1956] S-T-A-R-T, start goal. You need to get started. And you've never given.
[time=1961] And this concept is a little bit scary to you, but you hear the word of God.
[time=1966] You see the work around here. You listen to the testimonies, and you can feel the spirit of God is saying the time has come.
[time=1973] It's time to start.
[time=1976] Some of you are in that category.
[time=1978] Others of you are in the category we'll call the growth goal.
[time=1982] You're people who have given, but you give very sporadically.
[time=1986] You give if you can give as a second thought rather than a first priority.
[time=1992] You give occasionally, and you could rarely describe your giving as generous and sacrificial.
[time=1997] Some of you are giving, but you're not giving as a priority and generously and sacrificially.
[time=2003] You need to set a growth goal. You need to look inside your heart and say, "God, I don't want to be known for this for you.
[time=2010] I don't want to go my life, not dealing rightly with the issue of my giving.
[time=2014] And so, God, I need to set a growth goal here. Where should I start?
[time=2019] What would it look like for me in light of my situation and set a growth goal and fulfill it?"
[time=2025] And others of you need to set a stretch goal. That's what I meant.
[time=2029] Obviously, sarcastically, I'm very thankful for Ray's example and for his testimony.
[time=2034] And I need to consider what he said very carefully, because at whatever percentage I'm at, I'll be honest with you.
[time=2040] I think I plateaued in my mind. I'm thinking, "Wow, I got that taken care of you. I'm out of there."
[time=2046] And you hear that heart, you hear that call to love, you hear that call to grow, not just in your personal disciplines, but in your giving as well. I'm going to do some work here with the Lord.
[time=2055] I'm going to ask him, "Well, what's the stretch goal? Where do you want me?
[time=2059] How are you going to push me? How are you going to grow me? Where are you leading me?" I want to respond to your grace in my life. Some of you need to make that decision.
[time=2069] Now, wherever you are, whichever one of those three categories you may be in, I've got two things I want to say as we close, and you need to know both these things.
[time=2075] Number one, God will meet your needs. You see, when you step out now, you start giving something you weren't given before.
[time=2083] You've got the wondering in your mind, "How am I going to meet my obligations?" "What happens if I give and then I don't have?" Philippians 4.19 says this, "And my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches."
[time=2098] Did you hear that? That's a promise from God. It says this, "My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches.
[time=2105] My friends, your needs are not going to go unmet." For some of you, a start goal is going to take money from you that you have no idea where it's going to come from, and you don't know how you can do this, but you're going to purpose in your heart.
[time=2117] I want to assure you that God is going to meet your needs. He's committed to that.
[time=2122] Same for those of the growth and the stretch goal people.
[time=2127] After World War II, there were a whole bunch of orphans all over the cities of Europe.
[time=2132] And the Allies moved in as they had already conquered.
[time=2136] They now moved to restore and to bring order and to rebuild.
[time=2140] And one of the issues that was heavy on their heart was what to do with all the orphans running all out of all these cities.
[time=2145] And so they began to build orphanages so they could gather the children who now had no parents because of the war effort.
[time=2153] And a story comes, a true story comes from one of those orphanages.
[time=2157] That though these little tykes, though these little orphans were now bathed and fed and clothed and housed in a way they hadn't experienced through the horrors of war,
[time=2168] they were still unable to fall asleep at night.
[time=2172] And so they would lay awake long hours and they were becoming sick and they wondered what can we do about this problem.
[time=2178] Why did these little orphans stay awake?
[time=2181] And finally the director of the orphanage instructed the cook to make little loaves of bread.
[time=2188] Little did he but he loaves of bread.
[time=2190] And he had the staff go down through at the bedtime and hand each little orphan their own personal private little bread.
[time=2200] And they slept like babies.
[time=2202] You see they were terrified that they wouldn't have anything in the morning.
[time=2206] They had too many experiences where they had something barely that day and the next day and the next day and the next day they had nothing.
[time=2213] It was prohibiting their sleep. But once they had a little loaf, a little promise of food for tomorrow, they fell fast asleep.
[time=2222] Philippians 4.19 is your promise. Philippians 4.19 is your little loaf.
[time=2227] You honor God.
[time=2229] God will meet your needs.
[time=2233] He is totally committed to you.
[time=2237] The second thing I want to say is really motivating, at least it is in my heart.
[time=2241] Turn over to 2 Corinthians 9 if you would just for a second he kind of wraps his discussion up.
[time=2247] And he says in verse 6, "Now this I say he who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly.
[time=2257] And he who sows bountifully shall also reap bountifully." Now this is the analogy of the farmer.
[time=2264] And of all the things that the farmer does, of all the things that constitute the farmer's work,
[time=2270] one that he draws the analogy to in terms of giving is the seed itself because the seed multiplies itself.
[time=2278] Now in our day and age think of it this way, a farmer is going to farm some property.
[time=2281] And so he has got to go out and he has got to buy a tractor, $250,000 tractor and he buys the tractor.
[time=2287] And you know what that tractor does? It depreciates for the day that he owns it.
[time=2290] He never comes out to his barn one day and opens it up and suddenly there s, oh there s six tractors.
[time=2295] The one tractor turned into six tractors. That never happens.
[time=2299] He s got to have fuel for his tractor so he buys a big fuel thing and fills it up with thousands of gallons of fuel.
[time=2304] And every day he uses it, it gets emptier and emptier and emptier and emptier until it s all gone.
[time=2309] He never comes out one morning and so, oh hey look there s a whole bunch of fuel containers, never happens.
[time=2315] Hires people to work in his field, they work for the money he paid them. When they re done they go home.
[time=2320] They don t multiply, he doesn t get twice as many workers the next day for less money.
[time=2325] But when he plants his seed, when he plants his seed something terribly different happens.
[time=2331] He takes that little seed and he puts it in the ground. Now listen to this.
[time=2335] If he plants two bushels of wheat, do you know how many bushels he gets back?
[time=2339] 67 on average. If he plants three bushels of oats, do you know how many he gets back?
[time=2347] 79 on average. It s the only part of the farming enterprise that multiplies itself and he gets more than he gave.
[time=2357] And that is the exact analogy that God wants to put in your mind when he asks you to give generously and sacrificially.
[time=2366] And as a first priority he says, listen think of it as seed that you re planning in the ground.
[time=2371] Think of it as an investment that is going to return.
[time=2375] Jesus says in Luke 638, give and it will be given to you. Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over.
[time=2385] They will pour into your lap, for by your standard of measure it will be measured out to you.
[time=2391] The generosity and the graciousness and the sacrificial dimensions to which you give, that will be the measure to which it is given.
[time=2399] He says it will flow over into your lap because in the ancient Middle Eastern market when you would go to buy you d have a long cloak on and you d give the person money and then you d get ready to receive whatever it is you were going to buy.
[time=2411] And you can see the imagery. God says, man, you give to me, you hold your tunic up, okay? And here s what I m going to do.
[time=2418] I m going to give you good measure, then I m going to press it down, then I m going to shake it all together until it s running over the edge.
[time=2425] And I m going to pour it into your lap. That s where the imagery of the lap comes from.
[time=2430] In Malachi 3, the people were not giving to God and so He says to them, will you rob God?
[time=2436] In other words, will you hold back from God the part that is His? That s so interesting. He says to them in light they hadn t been doing that, they hadn t been giving.
[time=2444] They had been messing up. And He doesn t come to them there in Malachi 3 and say, Doc, start or I m going to curse you.
[time=2451] You know what He says doing? He says, give. Give what you haven t been giving and test the Lord and see if it isn t true that your barns are bursting with all that I will give you.
[time=2464] There s a strong incentive that God gives you when He asks you to give sacrificially. He says, consider it seed.
[time=2472] Now you re going to get back more than you gave. Know that it s going to be good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over. It s going to pour into your lap.
[time=2481] Proverbs 19 says, He who is gracious to a poor man lends to the Lord. When you give to meet the need of another person or the ministry of a church or whatever it is, you re making alone to God.
[time=2492] Guess who always pays his debts with huge return? God does. God doesn t get delinquent on his debts to you.
[time=2503] Now I ll confess, I don t know how that all works. I believe you could give sacrificially. I think you do without some things.
[time=2509] I know in my life with Heidi we have given some extra portions and we have gone without a few things and maybe it s time before God repays some of that.
[time=2519] And as James said in the video, it s not the kind of thing where you give so you can get. I m not offering a prosperity gospel here where if you give then you ll get really rich.
[time=2528] I don t think that s true. But I ve got to be faithful to say what God has said you give and you plant your seeds and you re going to get a return. You re going to get a harvest.
[time=2535] And it s going to surprise you. I believe that s true because the Bible says it s true.
[time=2543] Well now we ve talked about it. We ve called you to a basic category of decision. And you re going to have to think this through as a family. You re going to have to think this through as individuals.
[time=2552] And I want to encourage you not to be like the people in James who remember that James it says that you look into the mirror. The Word of God is like the mirror.
[time=2563] And you see the corrections that need to be made. Oh, I got to get a shave and I need a haircut. And you see the corrections that need to be made.
[time=2570] But you walk away from the mirror and you forget everything that you saw. It s our heart that you don t do that. That you honor God with the truth that He has brought into your life.
[time=2582] And sometimes that can be difficult. Sometimes a husband and wife can differ on that opinion. Well, let s see what that looks like.
[time=2590] Give, give, give. And the guy holds us over 15 extra minutes with another message on giving that I missed the first quarter of the game.
[time=2601] I did. I missed the first quarter of the game. The guy is obviously not a basketball fan.
[time=2607] He doesn t do it that often. In fact, I can t remember the last time he s preached on giving. Why are you so annoyed?
[time=2615] I m annoyed because it s a conspiracy, Vicki. I mean, the preacher at church, the preacher s on TV, the preacher s on the radio, the preacher s on the mail, they all want a piece of my wallet and I m tired of it.
[time=2625] You re just mad because you missed a little bit of your basketball game. You bet I am. I mean, if a guy wants my money, he best not make me late for my game.
[time=2632] That s sure not going to motivate me to give. What about God? I m sure God understands the necessity of basketball.
[time=2642] Will you quit? Will you quit and take a time out on basketball, please? I think we need to talk about our giving.
[time=2651] You talk, I ll listen. It doesn t work that way. Vicki, don t turn off the t. Don t. See, it is a conspiracy. Giving right. All right, let s have a meaningful dialogue.
[time=2664] I think we need to consider increasing what we ve been giving. Increasing. What do we have to give more of, huh? Our time? Between the two of us, we already spend every night at church. That doesn t even include Saturday morning and Sunday services.
[time=2682] I m talking about money. So am I. I mean, what price do you put on our time, huh? I didn t know we were supposed to do that.
[time=2687] Maybe we should start. Everybody else does. You know, John and Brenda, they hardly give any money at all in the offering. They figure they give 10% of their time to the church. Man, if we did that, the church would owe us rebates.
[time=2700] That s John and Brenda. I thought we were doing it as a matter of conviction.
[time=2705] We are, but I don t know. Maybe we re too convicted. Bob, will you get serious? I ve been looking through our checkbook here. Do you realize we aren t even giving 10% of what we bring in? Vicki, we give what we can afford to give.
[time=2724] Can we afford not to give at least 10%? You and Pastor must be in this thing together, huh? Listen, we re on a financial crunch, all right? Your new car, my golf clubs, those things aren t cheap. Not to mention the other things that we buy so that we can be comfortable in the lifestyle that we enjoy.
[time=2740] Listen, you want to take care of the finances fine. Go ahead. They re yours. That s not what I m talking about. And you know it. This whole thing has nothing to do with your ability to handle our finances.
[time=2750] We re talking about this. Because I was affected by what the pastor said this morning. And we should consider giving more than we have been.
[time=2759] And whose puck is it going to come out of, huh? Are you going to tighten up a little bit more? Stop buying dresses, shoes, pie and coffee after choir practice, huh?
[time=2767] Yes. If you re willing to cut back on golf and the racquet club and stereo equipment. Yeah, all right. We ll see.
[time=2778] This whole thing wasn t supposed to be a tug of war. I don t know what s going on here. I thought we used to give from our hearts together.
[time=2788] Do you remember back when we were first Christians right after we got married and we lived in that tiny apartment?
[time=2796] And you worked at the dry cleaners and I worked. Where did I work? Some diner. Oh, that s right. My feet still hurt just thinking about it.
[time=2805] But you used to pick me up after work and we talked over coffee about things that were really important about us and God.
[time=2816] Remember? We didn t have a lot of money back then, but I know we gave a lot more than 10 percent.
[time=2826] Percent just didn t matter back then. We were new Christians then. And we were giving to the Lord out of love for Him.
[time=2837] Yeah, I remember. And now here we are in our upper middle class tax bracket and we can t afford to give like we used to.
[time=2849] Maybe God ought to take back some of what He s given us so that we can.
[time=2859] You can go back to your ball game. I m finished.
[time=2864] Vicki, I m just trying to be practical.
[time=2878] Things sure aren t like they used to be. I wonder why that is.
[time=2892] Hi, my name is Russell Moore and I want to welcome you to the Bible Hour and thank you for joining us again today.
[time=2897] Well, we re in a two part series entitled Money Matters and I don t think you saw the first in the series because we were preempted by the Easterseals.
[time=2907] But I m so thankful for the opportunity and the privilege to teach what God s word has to say about money.
[time=2914] And I guess if the truth were known, sometimes I really hesitate to talk about that because I m oftentimes afraid of being lumped in with television evangelists who as time has proven may have been more interested in the money than people s souls.
[time=2931] But I feel an obligation and it really is a privilege to be able to communicate the truth from God s word because I believe that it makes an enormous difference in the way that we experience our life.
[time=2941] Money seems to be a part of everything that we do and God s word isn t silent on that and I think we can really achieve spiritual growth and a sense of wholeness and integrity as we examine that part of our life as well as the other parts.
[time=2955] The first installment on the series I spoke about developing a budget how to kind of take a look at all the money that God has given you and experience financial freedom and by that I don t mean financial independence.
[time=2968] That s the notion where you have so much money you could spend it all never work another day and you d always have more and I know personally that would destroy my life.
[time=2976] I don t think I do very well into those kinds of conditions.
[time=2979] Financial freedom on the other hand is learning to manage the money that God has given you in such a way that you are not followed around by the dark cloud of anxiety and stress that debt or that a very strapped budget situation kind of provokes in the heart.
[time=2998] Oh my am I going to have enough money to pay my bills at the end of the month and you just barely make it by each and every day.
[time=3005] And that life is almost a sort of bondage to money and I don t believe that s what the Lord wants for you or for me.
[time=3011] And so I spoke about a way to kind of not be involved in that and I ll just give you the three points I gave in that first message.
[time=3018] Number one when you get your paycheck the first thing you do is pay God.
[time=3021] Give God 10% or whatever is in your heart to give and honor him and worship him and acknowledge him as the one who gave you the capacity to earn the money in the first place.
[time=3032] The second thing to do is pay yourself.
[time=3034] I m amazed at how many people when they get their paycheck they pay everybody else in the city.
[time=3040] All the bills that they owe and they never keep anything for themselves for the rainy day or for retirement.
[time=3046] And that presents an enormous amount of stress if you know that you re not saving for your future.
[time=3052] And then that 80% that s left learn to live inside of that.
[time=3055] Develop a standard of living that allows you to comfortably live within what s left after you ve paid God and paid yourself.
[time=3063] And I think you ll experience a kind of freedom and a kind of joy that is hard to put into words.
[time=3070] Well, today I talk, as you know, I ve talked about giving and giving to the ministry of the local church.
[time=3076] And I want to say to you that your first priority in giving is to your local church.
[time=3081] And it s wonderful to support other organizations, other Christian ministries.
[time=3085] That s great. I know all of us do that.
[time=3087] But the primary place of support should be to your local church to establish the ministries that God has led you and the community of believers that you worship with to establish and to build.
[time=3097] I m so thankful for Black Hawk Baptist Church and for the many, many ministries that make this church what it is.
[time=3104] One of those is especially dear to my heart, it s our Christian school, Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=3110] And I say that because I have five kids, four daughters and then a son.
[time=3114] My eldest daughter is a freshman in the school.
[time=3116] She s 14 years of age. She played on the basketball team and the volleyball team.
[time=3120] And her life is being wonderfully changed by the ministry of our school.
[time=3124] And I go all the way down to Whitney, who s my youngest daughter. She s a kindergarten.
[time=3128] And frankly, I can hardly wait for my little son, Bobby, who s now only two and a half to finally enter the process because it s changing their lives.
[time=3134] It s conforming them to Christ and it s giving them a phenomenal education.
[time=3138] In fact, one of the things that compelled me to come to Black Hawk Baptist Church to Fort Wayne, Indiana from my home in California was the ministry of the church and certainly a part of that, the Christian school.
[time=3149] Today I d like to introduce you to the principal of our school and his name is Steve Longbreak.
[time=3155] Steve, welcome to the Bible Hour.
[time=3156] Thank you.
[time=3157] Glad you could be here.
[time=3158] I m really happy I m here.
[time=3160] Now, I know that our school has been in existence for 25 years and that s why I think we re as strong as we are because a lot of people have dedicated their lives to that school.
[time=3168] You ve been a part of it for how long?
[time=3170] 17.
[time=3171] 17 years.
[time=3172] What s the average tenure of our faculty?
[time=3174] Our faculty have been here a little over 10 years now.
[time=3176] The average person has served here a little over 10 years.
[time=3179] I think that s where a lot of our strength comes from.
[time=3181] Oh, no doubt about it.
[time=3182] People care.
[time=3183] They love our school.
[time=3184] Now, back in 1987, you set some goals with our school board and our elder board and I d like you to maybe share what those goals are and how we re moving towards meeting them.
[time=3193] What happened was, in the years just preceding 1987, we reached a plateau in that all of our classes were pretty well full and a lot of classes had a waiting list.
[time=3205] And it broke our heart to say to people, I m sorry, we can t help you.
[time=3209] You need to go somewhere else.
[time=3210] We wanted to serve those people.
[time=3212] At the same time, we had a real conviction, the school board and the elders, the people involved in the school had a conviction that you want to maintain that intimacy that you have with a small group of people.
[time=3223] And we think maybe schools have gotten too big in the United States.
[time=3227] That s part of our problem.
[time=3228] And so we wanted to try to maintain some of that and we ve kind of studied that and believed that if we have two classes per grade level, that we might be able to max out at 750 students or so K through 12 and still enjoy the kind of intimacy that we need.
[time=3243] By that I mean parents and teachers and students really know each other.
[time=3249] And there s an accountability and a responsibility that takes place there that s really natural.
[time=3254] And I like it and I want to maintain that and so that s important to us.
[time=3259] But in 1987 we decided to start doubling our school size.
[time=3262] And so the next year we added a second kindergarten and we ve been adding a second class every year since then.
[time=3268] And so now we re K through seven double tracked with, we have the capacity for 60 students in the seventh grade.
[time=3274] And we have two seventh grade classes and it s been a lot of fun to watch more kids come into the school and see the changes there.
[time=3280] But that s what s been happening and we re going to continue growing until we have two twelfth grade classes five years from now and about 750 students we hope.
[time=3289] Yeah, that s wonderful.
[time=3290] Now how many students do we have right now for example in our senior class, our twelfth grade class?
[time=3294] We have 30.
[time=3295] We have 30 students there.
[time=3296] They re having a great year.
[time=3297] I ve enjoyed watching them play basketball and been a lot of exciting things.
[time=3301] Oh yeah, I m proud of them.
[time=3302] They re really spiritually sensitive and academically strong.
[time=3305] I m really pleased with their progress.
[time=3307] Now when we talk about a Christian education in terms that I can understand, what does that mean?
[time=3313] You know I thought yesterday I drove up to drop my son off at the elementary.
[time=3317] And when he got out of the van I thought I m so thankful that what he s going to hear all day is coming from trustworthy people who I can place my trust in, who have an accountability to the Lord and are teaching him the truth and are also equipped
[time=3336] themselves to prepare him academically.
[time=3339] They re strong teachers.
[time=3341] And I can drop my two children off and be really at ease because they re doing exactly what I want them to do in the classroom.
[time=3349] They re helping support what Renee and I want supported at home.
[time=3353] That s right.
[time=3354] I feel the exact same way.
[time=3355] When I see my kids go after school I say to myself they re going to get the exact same values, the exact same principles communicated by godly people who have great attitudes love their job all day long.
[time=3365] I mean it s a blessing.
[time=3367] Yes it is.
[time=3368] Now I know we re committed to strong academics.
[time=3371] What does that mean?
[time=3373] How does that flesh out?
[time=3374] Well you know we evaluate ourselves based on how students are doing in the workforce perhaps or how they re doing in college or how they ve known on SAT tests or other achievement tests the I step for instance in Indiana.
[time=3386] And you know I m really happy to say our kids test out really well.
[time=3389] And we have students in every occupation you can imagine out there.
[time=3393] Some of the brightest ones are doing great jobs in arenas that are really demanding of them mentally and they re able to do that.
[time=3401] Others have jobs that are more physical in nature and they re doing well at that.
[time=3405] So we run the whole gamut there.
[time=3407] And I m really pleased to say our kids test well and perform well.
[time=3411] I d put them up against anybody.
[time=3413] That s wonderful.
[time=3414] Now are we accredited?
[time=3415] Yes we re accredited by the state of Indiana.
[time=3417] We went through performance based accreditation three years ago and we were approved for five years so we have three more years now that will be accredited and then we go through a review process.
[time=3427] I m thankful for that accreditation.
[time=3429] Good.
[time=3430] Now we re a part of a thing called ACSI.
[time=3432] What is that and why are we a part of it?
[time=3434] We re a part of ACSI, the Association of Christian Schools International.
[time=3438] It s an organization that is international in scope.
[time=3441] It helps schools all across the world to support families who want those same values put into their children.
[time=3449] And they provide us with service opportunities.
[time=3452] They ll materials, textbooks, advice.
[time=3456] They also offer us opportunities for a lot of our kids to compete in academic arena, in quizzing or in spelling, bees, those kinds of things.
[time=3467] And also athletically a lot of our kids get to compete in athletic tournaments that are sponsored by ACSI.
[time=3473] That s wonderful.
[time=3474] Now we re in the process of taking registration.
[time=3477] Would you tell us how we might, you know, how does a person watching today become a part of that process?
[time=3483] We really hope that there are a lot of people who are interested in Black Hawk Christian school.
[time=3487] You know about half of our students aren t from Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=3490] As a matter of fact a little more than half.
[time=3492] And for all these years we ve had students all over our community coming here.
[time=3495] And you can register at 4937400 or 4937470 if you have a 7 through 12th grader.
[time=3505] Either of those numbers you can just call the church number that s fine.
[time=3508] And the next two weeks we ll be accepting registrations from outside the church and the school family.
[time=3514] So we d really like for you to do that.
[time=3516] Fantastic.
[time=3517] And I would really like for you to do that because I think you re going to be amazed at the personal growth that s going to occur in your child both academically
[time=3524] and spiritually.
