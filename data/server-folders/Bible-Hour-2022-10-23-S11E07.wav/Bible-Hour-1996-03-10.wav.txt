[time=30] [ Inaudible ]
[time=42] The battle that faces every single person who has ever lived, who would ever be in relationship with God.
[time=48] The central battle that every Christian must fight and win.
[time=52] The central battle that you and I have faced all this week and the one that is waiting for us as we walk out these doors.
[time=60] In fact, the one we engage in as we sit here this morning is the battle of lifestyle versus heart style.
[time=68] [MUSIC]
[time=75] >> This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=79] Thank you for joining us.
[time=81] One of the greatest battles the believer faces is living that Christian life from the heart, religion always seems to degenerate to the externals.
[time=88] How can we keep our hearts strong for God?
[time=91] Stay with us today as we look at what God's word says about lifestyle versus heart style.
[time=96] Now let's join our service.
[time=98] [MUSIC]
[time=102] >> He has blessed this nation.
[time=106] He has touched it with his hand.
[time=109] The promise of his faithfulness can be seen across the land.
[time=116] Our church bells ring in freedom.
[time=120] We can worship as we please and work to achieve our greatest dreams
[time=127] in security and peace.
[time=130] >> Our fields are full and harvest.
[time=134] The rains have always come.
[time=137] Our table is a banquet.
[time=141] Our silos overrun.
[time=144] And I know there is a reason why God has blessed us all so much.
[time=151] Mary something he's expecting from everyone else.
[time=161] >> We've been blessed to be our blessing, we've been blessed to be his son.
[time=179] we've been blessed to be the son.
[time=183] [MUSIC - 135 seconds]
[time=323] (audience applauds)
[time=330] - Hi, my name's Russell Moore and I wanna welcome you to the Bible Hour and thank you for joining us today.
[time=338] Well, we're excited about what God is doing at Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=341] And from time to time, we like to share some of the high points of that with you.
[time=345] One of the things that God seems to be having his hand in a mighty and a wonderful way is our youth ministry.
[time=351] And it's just a tremendously dynamic program we're ministering to hundreds of kids and taking them away on camp and teaching them the word of God and having them serve in various capacities.
[time=363] It's a wonderful thing and the leader of that ministry is with us here today.
[time=368] His name is Kip Klein and he is our youth pastor and he's been with us for about eight months.
[time=372] I wanna welcome you today to the Bible Hour, Kip.
[time=374] - Thanks, great to be here.
[time=375] - Good to have you.
[time=376] Kip, tell us a little bit about your background and the story that even led up to your coming to Black Hawk.
[time=382] - Well, I was born in South Bend, Indiana and my father was a public school administrator and we moved around a few times and ended up for the majority of my upbringing and Warsaw, Indiana.
[time=396] I went to high school at Warsaw High School and eventually went to Taylor University and graduated in four years there with a communications education degree.
[time=408] - That's wonderful.
[time=409] And then you were planning to be a teacher.
[time=411] In fact, you were teaching.
[time=412] - Yes, I taught English in high school in Dayton, Ohio,
[time=418] just north of Dayton, while my wife finished up school at Cedarville College.
[time=423] - And when did you come to know the Lord in your pilgrimage?
[time=426] - Well, I was born in a Christian family and actually was led to the Lord by my sister at a very young age.
[time=432] - As you've been with us now for about eight months, tell us a little bit about some of the priorities of ministry, some of the distinctive, some of the things you're pursuing and what you're seeing God do.
[time=443] - Well, when I came on board here at Black Hawk, there had been sort of a lull in the youth ministry and we needed to kind of pick things up and gain some momentum when I first came as far as just excitement about programs and things of that nature.
[time=459] And so for the first few months, that was my goal was to put programs in place that we could kind of gain that momentum.
[time=468] And after that happened, then we focused more on getting our specific programs in place to take our ministry exactly where we want to go.
[time=476] - Boy, that's great.
[time=478] I know that outreach is an emphasis for you and how are we pursuing that?
[time=482] - Well, we started that by just kind of corralling the students that had a burden on their hearts for outreach and forming a leadership team that allows us now with that team to put on large group outreach events that we have once a month.
[time=500] And they're centered around a theme that is non-threatening to the unchurched student.
[time=505] And we bring them into our facilities, which we're blessed, of course, with a lot of great facilities, including a great youth room, which we call the asylum.
[time=515] And we take them through some high impact kind of games and then bring them into the asylum for a show, which may include live music and video and present the gospel to them.
[time=528] - Boy, that's exciting.
[time=530] Really trying to reach kids in a way that makes sense to kids.
[time=533] The asylum, Kip was mission to asylum.
[time=534] It used to be a chapel.
[time=536] It's a beautiful, beautiful facility.
[time=539] And we've converted the whole thing for youth.
[time=542] We have video projection units hanging from the ceiling and screens that come out of the wall and there's a basketball court inside this room and games and vending machines and all kinds of stuff that is an effort on our part to make an environment that would really welcome kids who otherwise might not be very interested in church.
[time=561] And so we're excited about the way that that whole facility is working.
[time=565] Now you teach the word of God as a part of the program.
[time=568] What kinds of things are being taught?
[time=570] Who teaches?
[time=571] I mean, how does that happen?
[time=573] - Well, primarily I am the teacher of our youth hour and that's basically our Sunday school program for the high school students on Sunday morning.
[time=581] And all of that is centered around a theme that we have for the whole school year.
[time=587] And that theme is Let It Rain, R-E-I-G-N.
[time=593] And we have kind of three subcategories under that larger category in which all our Sunday morning teaching leads up to.
[time=603] And then at the end of each of those subcategories, we go to a camp and try to really emphasize that point.
[time=610] - When's the next camp coming up?
[time=612] - The next camp is coming up the first weekend in May and it's our third installment of the three.
[time=618] And so we'll be finishing up Let It Rain as it were this year and it'll be Let The Kingdom Rain.
[time=623] - And you go away like Friday, Saturday and Sunday, all three days or how does it work?
[time=629] - Yes, we'll leave Friday evening and have a session with a guest speaker and we'll be doing some music, some worship and a lot of large group games, interaction type thing through Saturday and also having two sessions on Saturday, then we'll wrap things up with a communion service together on Sunday morning.
[time=648] - And do you sense those camps are pretty powerful in the lives of kids?
[time=652] - Absolutely.
[time=653] We've targeted the camp as a situation where we take our growth area kids, the kids that are interested in growth and kind of just stretch them a little bit more.
[time=663] But also what's maybe more important is that we take our fence writing kind of students and challenge them to get over the hump.
[time=672] - Now, could anybody come and be a part of our youth group?
[time=674] I mean, how would they do that?
[time=676] If are they welcome and how would they do that?
[time=678] - Absolutely.
[time=679] We have several programs where you can come in and feel a part, I think, right off the bat of your student looking for that kind of interaction.
[time=688] We have Sunday morning at 11 o'clock is our youth hour and we often have visitors in that time.
[time=696] And that's usually the time to get in and get to know people.
[time=699] And then from there, get plugged into the other programs.
[time=702] - Well, that's great.
[time=703] Thanks for all you're doing.
[time=704] - You're welcome.
[time=704] - We appreciate it.
[time=706] Yeah, I just want to extend a welcome to you who may have teenagers.
[time=710] And I know that's a difficult year or a period of time.
[time=712] I have a freshman in high school now and our relationship continues to grow though it's very, very challenged.
[time=718] And I'm for one very thankful for Kip and for his volunteer staff and for the ministry that they have in my daughter, Randy's life.
[time=724] And if we can help you, we want to.
[time=726] Well, let's go back now to the regularly scheduled portion of our program.
[time=731] (gentle music) [MUSIC - 183 seconds]
[time=921] - This is how God showed his love among us.
[time=932] He set his one and only son into the world that we might live through him.
[time=936] This is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us and set his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[time=946] Dear friends, since God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
[time=952] No one has ever seen God, but if we love each other, God lives in us and his love is made complete in us.
[time=960] [MUSIC - 88 seconds]
[time=1057] (gentle guitar music) - When I was about 16 years old,
[time=1071] I went into a doctor's office because I had cave's feet, which meant that my arches were too high, very, very active playing football and basketball.
[time=1081] And as the basketball season developed there in my junior year, I would lose chunks of skin off the bottom of my feet because the arches were so high and the stress points were so small.
[time=1092] And my dad took me to a wonderful orthopedic surgeon who performed corrective surgery, did a marvelous job and I'm thankful to my dad and that surgeon to this day.
[time=1102] The recovery from the surgery, or part of the process was for me to have two casts on my legs at the same time from my knees down to my toes, which immobilized my ankles and it stayed that way for three months and I was quite the site around school as I kind of walked around like Frankenstein with my little cast walking heels on the bottom and my friends made fun of me and pushed me and I fell and all that stuff.
[time=1127] I'll never forget today that they went ahead and took those casts off.
[time=1135] I was absolutely shocked at what I saw.
[time=1137] As I looked down at what I thought were my feet and my calves because the inactivity, the disuse of the muscles in my feet and my calves stripped them of any definition and they were now these limp, lifeless, skinny little feet and these little twigs for calves.
[time=1158] And they're almost impossible to move my ankles just for pain and the surgery had affected none of those parts, had nothing to do with the surgery, had everything to do with the immobilization of those muscles.
[time=1170] And I remember very gently coming to the edge of that table and trying to put weight on my feet for the first time and hobbling with assistance over to a room where I could get my clothes on and struggling very tenderly to get some shoes that might stay on there and then I had to get crutches and the help of my mother, 16 years of age, football quarterback, basketball player, just to get out of the doctor's office and shuffle across the driveway there, the parking lot until I could finally get relief when I got to sit down.
[time=1203] Humiliating experience.
[time=1206] The phenomenon is called atrophy, atrophy.
[time=1212] It happens when a muscle becomes dysfunctionate because of disuse.
[time=1216] They had done nothing to harm the muscles in my calves or my feet but simply restrict their normal use.
[time=1225] And over a very short amount of time though all my life, I've been able to run and jump and stop and start, I was reduced to next to nothing as I had to shuffle my way to a place as quickly as I could to sit down.
[time=1239] That was my first experience with atrophy almost 20 years ago.
[time=1244] Well, I guess to be honest, more than 20 years ago.
[time=1247] (audience laughing) But since that day I have had repeated experiences with atrophy, not of the physical limbs of my body but the atrophy of my heart.
[time=1258] You see, the same thing happens in the spiritual dimension.
[time=1263] Fail to use your heart.
[time=1267] Fail to let your heart be the driving motivation
[time=1273] of your relationship with God.
[time=1274] For a moment, immobilize the exercise of your heart
[time=1280] and rest on the externals.
[time=1283] Of Christianity and the atrophy process begins immediately.
[time=1288] There's a king in the Old Testament named Azah, king of Judah.
[time=1296] He had a great heart for God.
[time=1298] Remembered in the early years of his reign as one who stood for true worship and he went through his country and tore down the false idols to false gods and erected temples or places of worship for the people where they could honor the true and the living God.
[time=1316] He even had to go toe to toe, nose to nose and eye to eye with the intimidating figure of his own grandmother at one point in his reign because she wanted to worship a false God and erect a false idol to him and he said no to her and he backed her down.
[time=1330] As you read the account of his life in Second Chronicles chapter 15, it says that Azah's heart was blameless all of his days.
[time=1341] It's a strong, vibrant heart for God.
[time=1344] Little later on, in fact, just the next chapter, a siege is taken of his kingdom and these people can no longer come and go and where there had been great prosperity and great wealth because he had honored God with his heart and God had chosen to prosper him.
[time=1361] This siege put all of that in question and people were going hungry and the wealth was depleting and so in a desperate and very fatally bad decision, he made an allegiance with a foreign pagan king for protection.
[time=1374] He's the king of Erem and God came to him in Second Chronicles 16, 9 and said this.
[time=1384] For the eyes of the Lord move to and fro throughout the earth that they may strongly support those whose heart is completely his.
[time=1395] You have acted foolishly in this.
[time=1399] Indeed, from now on, you will surely have wars.
[time=1403] Somewhere between chapter 15 and chapter 16, Azah allowed his heart to become immobilized and the process of atrophy set in and he eventually came to the place where his heart was so weak and so small and so deprived of its previous strength that when crisis occurred, he turned not for the protection and the provision of a loving, proven sovereign God, but instead he made an alliance with a pagan king.
[time=1432] And God comes to him and says, oh my friend, have you so quickly forgotten that all your success and all your victories and all your wealth and all the peace and all the prosperity that was yours wasn't yours because of you.
[time=1445] It was yours because you had a heart after me.
[time=1450] And I was day in and day out choosing to honor that heart.
[time=1453] It's hard to become weak.
[time=1460] And when it needed most to be able to trust in the true and living God, it didn't have the strength to do it anymore.
[time=1466] And so he shuffled his way across to his domain and found allegiance with a foreign king.
[time=1471] I want to say this to you this morning, that Christianity is first and foremost a matter of the heart, authentic relationship with God.
[time=1486] Authentic Christianity is an inside-out experience.
[time=1492] Time and time again, God would come to his people Israel and through his prophets say things like you are circumcised, you have an outward circumcision that's been performed on your body, which is supposed to be symbolic of your love for me, but the problem is you're not circumcised of heart.
[time=1512] You have never scored your heart to love me.
[time=1516] And instead all you have is ritual, all you have is external, all you have is a symbol.
[time=1522] The people were learning to repent by way of externals.
[time=1527] The people were learning to say they were sorry to God, not from their heart, but with external evidences.
[time=1533] And so they would rend their garments when bad news would come, or when some situation would develop and God comes to them in the prophet Joel in chapter two and says, rend your hearts, not your garments.
[time=1545] What he's saying is leave the externals alone, they mean nothing to me.
[time=1549] What I want to see broken, what I want to see ripped, what I want to see torn is your heart.
[time=1554] Samuel goes before the sons of Jesse to pick a king for Israel.
[time=1560] Samuel, a great prophet of God, a bank what is held in his honor and the sons are invited and he looks over the sons, the many of them there and looks at the first one, who is the tallest and the most handsome and has charisma dripping all over himself.
[time=1574] He could be a media image in Israel and he says, there's your king.
[time=1578] Will anoint this one king and God comes to Samuel and says, "Don't you ever forget that man looks "on the outward appearance, but I look on the heart." And so God rejected Samuel's choice for king and went to find one of the sons of Jesse who was so insignificant that he was a shepherd boy, not even invited to the great dinner to honor the prophet and says and finds there in that lonely field a boy with a heart after God and says, there's my king.
[time=1605] There's my king.
[time=1607] He has a heart, a heart for me.
[time=1613] No wonder Solomon wrote in Proverbs 4, 23, "Watch over your heart with all diligence "for out of it come the issues of life." The heart is prone to atrophy, my friends, and it's prone to atrophy very fast.
[time=1632] Without the careful deliberate attention to the matter of the heart, we wake up one day and we recognize we've lost the most significant battle in all of Christianity, the battle for our heart.
[time=1647] The battle that faces every person who would be in relationship with God, the battle that has faced every Christian who has ever lived.
[time=1658] The battle that you squared up on this week and you will have to face again as you walk out these doors is the battle to live heart style versus lifestyle.
[time=1668] Heart style versus lifestyle.
[time=1674] Lifestyle is full of patterns, good patterns, moral patterns.
[time=1679] Lifestyle is full of behaviors, traditions, rituals, routines, and externals.
[time=1684] And it all looks right and it's all in order and it's all in place and it's all biblical and it's all moral, but it's all on the outside.
[time=1692] And it leads to an atrophy of heart that weakens the heart.
[time=1701] Heart style on the other hand isn't about patterns and behaviors, traditions, rituals, routines, and externals, it's all about relationships.
[time=1708] Heart style is all about relationship with God and relationship with the people around you.
[time=1714] Heart style is marked by love.
[time=1716] Heart style is marked by heroic acts of self-sacrificing love one person for another.
[time=1724] Heart style is marked by people who find themselves suddenly overtaken with compassion for people who have need in their life, whether a wife, a husband, or a stranger.
[time=1735] Heart style is marked by people who pursue other people, who pursue God from somewhere deep within them.
[time=1743] They assess the condition of another person's life.
[time=1745] They assess the resources that they have to offer and they begin to pursue and give and love and communicate and serve.
[time=1752] Heart style is marked by points of great joy
[time=1758] and points of great sadness because life is not a routine anymore.
[time=1761] Life is not an external, life matters and people matter and we care about what we're doing and so there are times of great jubilation and joy when people respond to our love and then there are times of enormous sadness and brokenness because our love has been spurned.
[time=1775] Lifestyle is called living.
[time=1777] Excuse me, heart style is called living.
[time=1780] Lifestyle is called routine.
[time=1787] If you have your Bible this morning, come with me to Matthew chapter five.
[time=1790] We've been studying the Sermon on the Mount, we've taken a couple of weeks out to discuss the matter of finances and giving.
[time=1797] We come back and we come to a portion of this sermon,
[time=1803] these three chapters and Jesus through his incredible ministry of healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness and through his proclamation ministry and through his teaching ministry, he is now gathering crowds everywhere he goes and this particular crowd gathers with a great sense of anticipation and Galilee to learn what are the requirements to get into heaven and they're excited and there's a buzz across the crowd and they're all wondering what is Jesus going to say?
[time=1831] What is the standard that we have to achieve?
[time=1833] What are the entrance requirements so that we can live forever with God in heaven?
[time=1837] And Jesus shocks the crowd in chapter five verse 20 when he says, "For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven." You see the scribes and the Pharisees, they had lifestyle to a tee.
[time=1853] They made sacrifices, they offered prayers, they gave tithes, they wore religious dress, they dedicated their lives, every waking moment of their lives they gave to lifestyle religion and they brought every little last detail of their life into conformity to religious code and religious externals and religious ceremonies and religious calendars and religious festivals and they brought all that commitment right into the very essence of their home and even when the doors were shut, they were doing their best to have a lifestyle of religion and Jesus shocked them all when he said, "You know what?
[time=1894] Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you'll never see heaven." I mean, if you would have surveyed anybody in the land of Israel in that particular day and age instead of all of us, who would be the most likely to gain entrance into the kingdom of heaven, there would have been a resounding response, the scribes and the Pharisees, the scribes and the Pharisees, who could compete with that?
[time=1914] But Jesus is saying what you've got to understand
[time=1920] is that kingdom righteousness is not measured by what your hands do and what your feet do.
[time=1926] If we're gonna really understand the righteousness of God and what people who enter the kingdom behave like, we've got to take the meters of righteousness off of our wrists and off of our ankles and strap them directly to our heart and we've got to begin to take some internal readings on the realities of what is happening inside our hearts.
[time=1945] If you want to know about kingdom righteousness, if you want to know how high the bar of righteousness is that a person has to clear to get into the kingdom of God, get the meters off your hands and off your ankles and strap it to your heart.
[time=1963] Jesus is a master teacher and he knows that if he were to leave that statement in verse 20 out there for interpretation and without illustration and explanation, a lot of people would go away very confused.
[time=1975] And so in the next verses, he gives a tremendous illustration.
[time=1981] He says, how about we just take one of the externals?
[time=1985] How about we just take one of the 10 commandments and let's not take one of the peripheral 10 commandments, let's take one that's right at the heart of it all.
[time=1990] How about thou shalt not murder?
[time=1993] So that nobody can come to me later and say, man, you picked a pretty offbeat 10 commandment.
[time=1997] And I'm sure that as you begin to utter the words in verse 21, you have heard that the ancients were told you shall not commit murder and whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.
[time=2008] You could almost hear the scribes and the Pharisees with a sigh of relief because they're thinking in their hearts and they're thinking in their mind.
[time=2014] Oh man, that's great because I've never murdered anybody.
[time=2017] Whew, I thought he had me there for a minute but I know there has never been a day, there's never been a time, there's never been an incident where I've even struck anyone much less taken a knife or a club or a stone and for my own justification out of anger murdered somebody.
[time=2031] But Jesus didn't stop there, he kept talking.
[time=2037] So in verse 22 you read, but I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court.
[time=2049] And whoever shall say to his brother Raka shall be guilty before the Supreme Court and whoever shall say you fool shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell.
[time=2060] You see Jesus is saying you cannot justify yourselves
[time=2066] and you cannot find a place of self complacency just because you have never taken knife and gone to proximity and murdered someone because murder originates in the heart not with the hands.
[time=2079] Murder is first and foremost an issue of our hearts.
[time=2084] It is secondarily an issue of what we do with our feet to get to the place and what we do with our hands to strangle, to tie, to maim, to kill, to stab, to choke.
[time=2094] Murder is first and foremost a matter of the heart he says.
[time=2099] The first step of murder is anger.
[time=2105] And he means here in this word in the text in 22 he means both the flash of anger that comes up in the un, you know, in kind of the provoked, unsuspecting moment where you catch yourself with a flash of anger, but the word goes all the way to a brooding, simmering anger that is nurtured and never allowed to die where the angry one cherishes the resentment that they feel in their heart towards the perpetrator.
[time=2128] He says not only is anger a process
[time=2134] but then you use the word raka, a word that we don't often use.
[time=2138] There's a common phrase that meant something like idiot or jerk.
[time=2143] It is a sarcastic cutting comment that is provoked by the anger in your heart directed at whoever it is you're angry at.
[time=2152] It's a heartless rejecting and deriding of another human being.
[time=2157] But he goes further than that.
[time=2161] He says not only if you say raka are you guilty before the Supreme Court, but if you say you fool you shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell and the word fool is the word moros from which we get our word moron.
[time=2172] And it seems to be a word that isn't just raka as in that was a pretty idiot thing to do.
[time=2177] It's the notion of you are a fool, the defining characteristic of who and what you are.
[time=2190] It seems to be a progression, anger in the heart which gives word to a deriding comment like raka or idiot or jerk which gives rise then finally to a characterization of a person and you assassinate their character.
[time=2203] And so you know what, you're nothing but a fool to the core of your being your fool.
[time=2208] Well, you look at that.
[time=2213] Then you look at your heart and you look at your life
[time=2219] and you say uh oh, I'm in real trouble.
[time=2222] I was reflecting on this a little bit this week and I was trying to think of like who have I done that with?
[time=2228] And I was amazed at like I did it with my parents.
[time=2235] Oh, I can remember specific situations in my childhood where I was being disciplined by them for just cause.
[time=2241] I mean, they were loving me at the moment.
[time=2243] You know, I needed it.
[time=2245] And I can remember saying in my heart and feeling a level of fever pitch, boiling anger and under my breath as I was walking away so as not to get another spanking, say things like you guys are the biggest bunch of jerks I've ever seen, I hate you guys.
[time=2261] My favorite phrase was I will never, ever, ever, ever, ever talk to them again.
[time=2266] As if that wouldn't have been a blessing when I was eight.
[time=2270] I would call them things.
[time=2275] I would assassinate their character and I would do it from the core of my heart.
[time=2280] I have three older sisters.
[time=2284] Hit dawns on me.
[time=2285] I can remember specific situations with all three of them where the exact same process would have gone on.
[time=2290] They would have taken something that was mine or not giving me something that I wanted or whatever the situation was.
[time=2295] And I can remember words and feelings of absolute anger and hostility towards them.
[time=2300] I've done that with my wife.
[time=2303] They're one I've chosen to marry.
[time=2305] They're one I've promised to nurture.
[time=2307] There have been times in our marriage when I have been so angry, unjustifiably and selfishly and sinfully angry that, and praise God, I don't say those things to my wife.
[time=2317] But in my mind, I'm thinking things like you idiot, you jerk, you selfish blah, blah, blah.
[time=2324] I felt that way with my kids.
[time=2328] I mean, well, who else is there?
[time=2333] I'm guilty.
[time=2335] Oh, there's one other category, total strangers.
[time=2336] I do that with total strangers too.
[time=2338] My favorite, the place that gets me all the time, you're driving down the freeway like I-69.
[time=2344] And you got two lanes going this way, right?
[time=2346] And you got two lanes going the back way and you're going this way in there.
[time=2348] These semi big, huge, eight team leaders coming on the right-hand lane where they belong.
[time=2351] And then there are the slower cars that are in the right-hand lane with the slower trucks.
[time=2355] And you're moving along and all of a sudden, one of these idiots, one of these absolute jerks, one of these bone brains pulls out and goes next to the semi truck and drives the same speed.
[time=2367] And you're like, "Hello?" God, get a clue.
[time=2375] And they don't see that there are 15 cars stacking up.
[time=2378] And they don't see that I'm blinking my lights and driving on the left side of the lane.
[time=2382] I say to myself, "That person's an idiot." I bet they're, I bet they're that way everywhere.
[time=2390] I bet they're totally, I bet they're clues about life everywhere they go.
[time=2393] I mean, if they can drive that bad, I'll bet you they're clueless everywhere.
[time=2396] (congregation laughing) You don't ever do that, do you?
[time=2399] (congregation laughing) Man, Jesus comes to us and he says, "Hey, let me tell you something about murder.
[time=2407] "Start right here.
[time=2409] "Start right here in your heart.
[time=2411] "All you gotta do is be angry.
[time=2414] "And then all you gotta do is come up "with some verbalization of that anger.
[time=2418] "And then all you gotta do is assume "that characterization probably is like them all the time.
[time=2423] "And you're guilty enough to go to hell." You know what he's doing here, don't you?
[time=2432] You know what he's doing here on this mountain side?
[time=2434] You know, he's not trying to refine their concept of religion.
[time=2438] He's not trying to help them understand, well, let me give you some new things to work on, okay?
[time=2441] You got the externals pretty good.
[time=2443] Now, let me give you the ear internals, and if you can work really hard on the externals, and then you start working really hard on the internals, then eventually you'll get to go to heaven.
[time=2450] That's not what he's saying.
[time=2451] What he's saying is the standard is that absolutely impossible to meet.
[time=2455] And there is no human on earth who has ever lived, or who will ever live, that will be able to live from the heart without anger towards another person.
[time=2464] And so we may as well fast up to the issue right now if we're ever gonna go to heaven, and we gotta get there by the grace of God that has bestowed upon us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ who died in our stead.
[time=2477] He, by the way, never having been angry like this, or any other sin internally or externally, the spotless Lamb of God who comes in his enormous love and dies for us because we could never, ever, ever get close to meeting that kind of a standard.
[time=2494] It's completely out of our reach.
[time=2496] Always has been, and it always will be.
[time=2498] What he's begging for, what he is hoping for, what he is longing for is a confession from those who are listening him to the first point in his sermon, which is blessed are the poor in spirit.
[time=2511] And that means spiritually bankrupt.
[time=2514] Blessed are the people who know that they have a debt against God, debts of anger, and next week, debts of lust.
[time=2521] And wherever else we could go in the word of God, debts that are enormous, that are too expensive to pay off for which we have no resources and finally fall and can say, I deserve nothing but death and hell.
[time=2533] And all the best of my works mean absolutely nothing because the standard is so incredibly high.
[time=2537] Oh, God, please save me through Christ.
[time=2539] He's longing in his heart for people on that mountainside and for people in this sanctuary to come to that resolution and obvious conclusion about the quality and the character of our life.
[time=2552] See, man, pretty serious stuff, yeah.
[time=2561] Look what he says in verses 23 and 24 as he keeps going.
[time=2565] He says, now, if therefore you are presenting your offering at the altar and there, remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering before the altar and go your way, first be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering.
[time=2581] He has said, let me tell you something.
[time=2584] Relationship with me is so much an issue of the heart.
[time=2589] I mean, if we're not gonna connect at the heart level, then you need to go somewhere else to fix whatever it is out there, whatever broken relationship keeps you and me from relating on a heart level first and then come back and we'll be able to worship.
[time=2603] You'll be able to give me the worship that I am honored.
[time=2606] Maybe a way to understand this is to think about a father with two sons and he's all excited.
[time=2614] He's ready, he's got a couple of days off from work, he's been saving on this one for a little while, he's got the little vacation cash storage set up and he's got his fishing boat polished to a tee and the new reels and the rods are in there and all the preparations are made, the reservations have been taken care of and his two sons are gonna come and they're gonna go fishing together, the three of them, it's gonna be a great time.
[time=2635] What the father doesn't know is that the two sons have fallen out, I mean, they've had a fight and they're angry at each other and it's unresolved and there were some really hard things said, some bitter things said, some angry things said, some hurtful things said and they haven't worked that problem out yet, they haven't told their dad that yet because they figure it's just between the two of them.
[time=2658] Each one wants to go on the trip and be with their dad, each one wants to spend the time in the boat with their dad but they get on the lake and suddenly their father begins to be aware that conversations are rather measured and actions are somewhat calculated and the father can somewhat engage each one individually but the dynamic of fellowship and love and the free flowing spirit of community is nowhere in the boat and the anger and the unresolved hostility begins to stink more than even the fish, I mean, it's a bad situation and a couple of hours into this deal the dad says, hey, why don't we just pack it up?
[time=2699] This isn't what it's about, so they haul the boat back on the trailer and they kind of make their way home.
[time=2706] They can't enjoy each other and they can't enjoy their father but picture a different scenario where the two sons come
[time=2715] and they come with right hearts, they come having worked the issues out and they come saying to themselves, I'm gonna serve my brother this week, oh, I'm gonna serve him.
[time=2725] When the hard tasks are to be done, I'm gonna jump first and try to get them done and when the special opportunities are there, I'm gonna try to defer in such a way that it's not obvious but so that my brother gets the opportunity and I'm gonna be seeking from my brother and my father to connect in some really special ways.
[time=2739] I'm gonna be praying to that end and I'm hoping that my brother goes home from this fishing trip feeling better about himself and about God and about his father than he's ever felt in his life.
[time=2749] Imagine if both of them came that way.
[time=2752] Totally committed to being right in their relationship with each other, not just the end of hostility but the progressive movement of investing in another person, all about hard style, not about lifestyle.
[time=2765] Imagine the time they'd have, oh man, they'd be out there after dark.
[time=2772] They'd be saying, we gotta go home, can't we stay another day?
[time=2776] Man, this was the time of our lives.
[time=2779] You see, we can't come in here and try to give love to God and try to receive love from God and try to give worship to God and try to be affirmed by God if we're not right with each other.
[time=2791] That's what he's saying.
[time=2794] It just doesn't work that way.
[time=2795] You see, you only have one heart.
[time=2797] I only have one heart.
[time=2799] And if the heart that I have is angry, if the heart that I have is cursing, if the heart that I have is destroying one of my brothers and that relationship is falling apart, that's the very heart I bring to this place to worship God.
[time=2812] And you know what it is?
[time=2815] It's an angry, cursing, divisive heart.
[time=2818] It makes it very difficult to worship.
[time=2822] It's very difficult to worship God when all you can see on the screen of your imagination is the person that you're angry with.
[time=2828] Very difficult to have a sense of release as you begin to sing worship songs, as you begin to study under the word of God.
[time=2836] It's very difficult to affirm his truth and to give yourself a fresh and anew to God when you're holding a bitter, angry grudge against the brother.
[time=2844] That's what he's saying.
[time=2847] Jeremiah 7 says this, will you steal?
[time=2851] Will you murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, offer sacrifices, debate, and walk after other gods that you have not known, and then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name and say that we are delivered?
[time=2865] Time out, time out, he's saying, wait a minute.
[time=2871] You are who you are, and you're the same person in here that you are out there.
[time=2881] You know one of the most stunning implications of this truth is if we want to have great worship in this church.
[time=2888] I mean, if we really want to honor God on Sunday mornings and lift him up and make his name great, it's really not so much about the musicians, it's not so much about the singers, it's not so much about the drama, it's not so much about the building, it's certainly not so much about the preacher or the word even, it's about our hearts.
[time=2907] You want to improve the quality of worship of this church, bring a pure heart, bring a heart of integrity, bring a heart style into this place that is probably best evaluated by relationships.
[time=2924] Well, how serious is he about this?
[time=2932] I mean, how big a priority is it?
[time=2934] Look at verses 25 and 26.
[time=2936] He says, "Make friends quickly with your opponent at law "while you are with him on the way.
[time=2941] "In order that your opponent may not deliver you "to the judge and the judge to the officer "and you be thrown into prison.
[time=2948] "Truly I say to you, you shall not come out of there "until you have paid up the last cent." This is another way of saying what Paul later said in Ephesians 4, "Don't let the sun go down on your anger." Listen, if you've got a relational problem with a brother, now is the time to get it fixed.
[time=2964] Don't wait until Saturday night because you know tomorrow you've got to come to worship.
[time=2968] I mean, if the problem happened on Monday, then Monday afternoon would be fine.
[time=2972] If it happened on Tuesday, then Tuesday would be great.
[time=2976] He's saying, "Look, don't wait for the process, "the hardening process of your heart to set in.
[time=2982] "Don't wait for the process to take its full course "where you've got to get before the judge.
[time=2987] "The judge gives you to the officer "and the officer throws you in prison.
[time=2991] "Circumvert all that calcifying, hardening process "that atrophies the heart.
[time=2996] "Deal quickly with your opponent.
[time=3000] "Make it a matter of first priority." You know, we think of the Lord as the great physician, don't we?
[time=3007] He's the physician of our souls.
[time=3008] There are some medical problems in the physical realm that need immediate tension, there are others that don't.
[time=3015] It's really Kelly Bird's fault that my hand is spraying today.
[time=3020] You see, he's bigger and taller and stronger and better, and so he wants to play basketball, bigger and taller and better and stronger.
[time=3025] Guys, so there I am, this little pipsqueak on this court with these really good guys trying to do better than I am, straining to the last part of my body until finally I fall on my finger here, bend it all the way back to my wrist, bang my head on the court, my daughter sees the embarrassing event.
[time=3038] I went home very shamed.
[time=3040] It was not good, big swollen hand.
[time=3044] I go to my good friend, the doctor, and he examines it carefully, looking for possible breaks, pushing here and there.
[time=3049] He says, you know what likelihood is, it's not broken, probably just sprained, give it some time, it'll do better.
[time=3054] Take these pills.
[time=3055] I do all that.
[time=3057] Well, the two weeks go by, it still hurts a lot and I'm probably a prima donna, so I'm nervous and wondering about how could there be a bro, I think there's a lump right here.
[time=3065] Maybe there's a, so he indulges me.
[time=3067] Come on down, we'll give you an x-ray.
[time=3069] Sure enough, x-rays, no chips, no broken broons, no nothing, Russell, just rest it, it'll be okay.
[time=3074] Stop shaking hands with your right hand, so I do my Bob Dole limitation now.
[time=3077] (audience laughing) You know, some problems need immediate tension though.
[time=3083] See, he very wisely, as the smart physician says to me, he give this one some time, play this out, no big rush, we'll x-ray in a little while, if the problem continues, be patient with this thing, it's gonna take some time.
[time=3095] What do you think you'd say to me if I call him on the phone I said, hey Doc, I think I just ruptured my appendix.
[time=3101] Oh man, he'd have me in the hospital in a flash.
[time=3106] We determine the exact cause immediately because he knows if that appendix ruptured, there are toxins that come out of that appendix that have left unattended in a very short amount of time can take my life.
[time=3115] Jesus is just a good physician here, my friends, and he's talking to you about the condition of your soul and what he is saying to you is that some spiritual problems may have a longer recovery period and there may be a process of growth, but let me tell you about how to handle fractured relationships.
[time=3131] Treat it like a ruptured appendix and you refuse to allow the toxins that will come out and infect your own heart and that'll spread across the body of Christ lest that relationship be immediately repaired and dealt with.
[time=3146] Listen to your great physician and trust him.
[time=3148] You know, God has done so much
[time=3156] to make relationship from the heart possible with him.
[time=3159] This is so exciting, you know?
[time=3162] I mean, he labors for 2,000 years with the nation of Israel and the closest anybody can get is to the tabernacle and the Shekinah glory and God lives in the tent and we're on the outside and he puts these Levites and these high priests involved and we get some sacrifices going and the closest we can get the God is like in the temple and you can't even get to where he kind of resides.
[time=3178] There are the Shekinah glory and the holy of holies and that's only for the one time a year deal, the high priest on the day of atonement.
[time=3185] That's the old covenant, friends.
[time=3187] We come into the new covenant and God says, you know what, it's gonna be so exciting.
[time=3192] I'm gonna take up residence in your heart.
[time=3194] My holy spirit's gonna come and he's gonna live inside your body and I'm gonna give you a soft heart.
[time=3203] I'm gonna give you a new spirit and we're gonna walk hand in hand through all the experiences of life and to be near me, you don't have to come to a temple anymore and you don't have to give sacrifices anymore because my son is your sacrifice and I've made a heart to heart relationship immediately possible every moment of every day.
[time=3223] And do you know what God is saying to you today?
[time=3229] God is coming to you and he is saying, would you please take a spiritual EKG with me this morning?
[time=3233] And maybe you haven't noticed it, maybe just in the distraction of life, your heart has begun to atrophy and you're beginning to be caught up in a thing called lifestyle and all life is for you now as a ritual and you go through your routines.
[time=3246] You say, hey man, I didn't yell and scream at my wife.
[time=3249] In fact, we went out to dinner the other night and God says, that's great ritual.
[time=3253] Did you love her when you were with her?
[time=3255] Did you pursue her?
[time=3257] Did you meaningfully connect with her life?
[time=3261] You say to God, hold it God.
[time=3262] I came home three out of four, five nights this week.
[time=3265] I mean, I spent time with the kids.
[time=3266] We did this, we did this.
[time=3267] He says, great external, great ritual, great form.
[time=3271] Keep it up, you gotta be home if you're gonna be around your kids but did you love them this week?
[time=3277] Did you look into their eyes?
[time=3278] Did you look into the condition of their heart?
[time=3279] Did you hear what they were saying to you?
[time=3282] Did you communicate something of who you are to them?
[time=3285] You say, wait a minute, God, I read my Bible every day this week and I'm here in church today and I even gave a check in the offering.
[time=3295] God says, that's great, keep doing it but did you connect with me in the process?
[time=3300] Lifestyle or heart style?
[time=3307] God's saying, you know what, if your heart is weak today, if you've been involved in some atrophy, God isn't scolding you this morning, God isn't trying to deride you this morning, God isn't trying to beat you up this morning, God is trying to say in neon signs, I love you so much that all it takes is you to confess the condition of your heart and let's get back walking together, heart to heart.
[time=3338] And some of you are really reluctant to do that today because you've got some private sins in your life, you've got some things that you're cherishing, you've got some things that you're holding as a greater prize than Christ then you know exactly what it is as I say those words and God is saying to you, it's a loving, gracious heavenly Father, let go of it today, give it up, give it up again, offer it up as a sacrifice to me today so we can walk heart to heart.
[time=3363] And others of you don't wanna do that today because you've got an angry problem with somebody in your life and you've got it worked around in your mind that they are so wrong and you are so right and what they have done is so enormous and so unforgivable and you are cherishing and nurturing your anger and your resentment and you're not sure it's worth it letting that go.
[time=3383] And God's saying to you, oh my friend, go find whoever it is and write them a check of forgiveness, forgive the debt that they have against you.
[time=3396] Go in humility and brokenness, not defending yourself and just say, you know, I was wrong at whatever level you were wrong.
[time=3402] That's why I wanna get this thing.
[time=3405] So much as it's dependent upon me, right.
[time=3407] God's saying worship me this morning, worship me this morning, not in ritual and not in pattern and not in external but give me your heart.
[time=3418] And you probably really wanna give it to him, don't you?
[time=3424] I mean, you can feel it.
[time=3425] You're saying, yeah, that sounds really good.
[time=3428] I know there's something intrinsically right there.
[time=3430] David, the great man with the great heart for God said, "This search me, O God, and know my heart.
[time=3437] "Try me and know my anxious thoughts "and see if there be any wicked way in me "and lead me in the way everlasting." Maybe you can't give it up today.
[time=3449] Maybe you're not ready to do that.
[time=3451] Well, then please just do this much.
[time=3452] Invite God to make a careful search of your heart.
[time=3456] And give him the permission to root up the wickedness and drive out the rebellion.
[time=3461] Say, "Oh God, get me back." It's where my heart is soft and supple.
[time=3467] Let's pray together.
[time=3470] Gracious God and heavenly Father, we hear your voice today.
[time=3478] We hear it from your word, we heard it in song.
[time=3481] We hear you saying loud and clear that you love us unconditionally, that there's nothing we could ever do, that would ever cause you to turn your back on us.
[time=3489] But there are some things we can do to rob us, the joy of our salvation, to rob us the wonder of walking day by day, step by step under the leading of the Holy Spirit.
[time=3498] And so we offer to you whatever it is this morning, each person offering right now, whatever it is, give it to him.
[time=3506] Give him whatever it is that holds you back from a step by step intimacy with Christ.
[time=3514] We love you Father, thank you in Christ's name, amen.
