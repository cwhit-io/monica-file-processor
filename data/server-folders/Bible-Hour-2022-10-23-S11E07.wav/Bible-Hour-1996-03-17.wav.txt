[time=30] Imagination allows us to see a vision and to have an anticipation and begin to move towards
[time=48] great accomplishments.
[time=50] Imagination is a great blessing of God.
[time=54] But there's a shadow side to our imagination.
[time=58] There's a shadow side to our imagination which allows us to see ourselves in God dishonoring
[time=65] and self-destructive activities.
[time=76] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=80] Thank you for joining us.
[time=81] Today in our continuing series on the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus fearlessly marches onto the battlefield of human sexuality.
[time=89] What is the difference between looking and lusting?
[time=91] How can we keep a pure heart before God as we interact with members of the opposite sex?
[time=96] Stay with us today as we find practical answers to these questions from our study in God's
[time=102] word.
[time=103] Now let's join our service.
[time=116] "Some find their strength in the pleasure of things, some put their trust in the power
[time=126] of kings, some then we die for what a woman can bring, but I find my strength in you."
[time=138] "Some make their first in the strength of their will, some search for fame for the ultimate
[time=158] thrill, some try it all and find that nothing fulfills.
[time=164] But I find my strength in you, 'cause when it all comes crashing down, I can run to you.
[time=176] I've found the world under the weight of this world, when I need a place to go, I can run
[time=187] to you, I know I've found my strength in you, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[time=205] Some build their lives like castles on sand, others still search for a place they can stand,
[time=216] some hold their heaven in the palm of their hand, but I find my strength in you, 'cause
[time=226] when it all comes crashing down, you're the only rock I've found that will crumble under
[time=235] the weight of this world, and when I need a place to go, I can run to you, and I know
[time=246] my strength in you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[time=264] so when it all comes crashing down, and the only rock I've found that will crumble under the weight of this world, when I need a place to go, I can run to you, I know.
[time=286] I'll find my strength in you, I'll find my strength in you, wherever I go, wherever I do, I'll find my strength in you, oh.
[time=313] I'll find my strength in you, I'll find my strength in you, oh, oh, oh.
[time=342] Oh, and the only way I've ever been able to survive marriage with my wife is to become a mind-reader.
[time=348] Jack, you're such a nut, and I don't think Katie would have liked you saying that, either.
[time=352] I knew you were going to say that. Very funny. Well, I've got a lot of work left to do, thanks so much for your help.
[time=357] No, hey, don't mention it. Oh, Mary, how about lunch tomorrow? My treat. Well, I know this great place over on Canyon.
[time=374] The fettuccine will just melt in your mouth. I don't think that'd be a very good idea.
[time=379] Well, you don't like fettuccine? No, I love fettuccine, it's just that... What? Well, we're both pretty married.
[time=387] So? So, I just don't think it would look right, even as friends. Yeah.
[time=403] Look, Mary, I... Oh, my, this is awkward. Let's forget about it, okay? No.
[time=414] I'm very attracted to you. Jack. No, silly to keep trying to hide it. Jack, we shouldn't be having this conversation.
[time=421] But if you feel something... Jack, don't make me do this. Look, I love working here with you.
[time=427] It's made a very ordinary job, really fun. But we're married.
[time=433] So, you've been thinking about it, too? Jack. I wasn't just imagining that. Look in your eyes. Jack!
[time=438] You are the most intelligent, attractive woman I have ever met. I look forward to coming into work every morning.
[time=444] I dream at night that everything else could just go away and... Jack, please!
[time=449] You've told me yourself that you and your husband aren't getting along. I shouldn't have told you that.
[time=456] But you did. Hasn't it ever occurred to you that you and I... Of course it has! Look, you're a wonderful man.
[time=465] If you and I were single, this would all be perfectly normal, perfectly healthy. I know.
[time=470] Just two people who enjoy each other. You know, just taking the time to get to know each other more.
[time=475] Jack, please! Tell me you don't feel any of this.
[time=487] I don't know what I feel. Then why can't we just find out? I'm not talking about a commitment or some wild fling.
[time=497] I just want the chance to get to know you better. That's all. Just spend a little more time with you.
[time=504] If you don't want that, if you don't want anything to do with me, just tell me. I'll walk away.
[time=511] I could even get a transfer out of this department for that matter.
[time=516] I can't.
[time=519] Look, we can talk more about this, all right? Tonight, after choir practice, maybe we can just slip out for some coffee.
[time=532] Okay?
[time=534] Look, everything's going to be all right. I promise.
[time=539] I promise.
[time=563] What appears to be a harmless glance can turn to romance, and homes are divided.
[time=575] Feelings that should never have been awakened within.
[time=582] Tearing your heart into, listen, I beg of you. Guard your heart. Guard your heart.
[time=595] Don't trade it for treasure. Don't give it away. Guard your heart. Guard your heart.
[time=607] As a payment for pleasure, it's a high price to pay.
[time=614] For a soul that remains sincere and a conscience clear. Guard your heart.
[time=626] The human heart is easily strained, and often betrayed at the hand of emotion.
[time=638] We dare not leave the outcome to chance. We must choose an advance.
[time=645] Live with the agony, such needless tragedy. Guard your heart. Guard your heart.
[time=658] Don't trade it for treasure. Don't give it away. Guard your heart. Guard your heart.
[time=669] As a payment for pleasure, it's a high price to pay. Guard your heart. Guard your heart.
[time=682] Don't trade it for treasure. Don't give it away. Guard your heart. Guard your heart.
[time=693] As a payment for pleasure, it's a high price to pay.
[time=699] For a soul that remains sincere and a conscience clear. Guard your heart.
[time=725] Well, indulge me here as we get started. Let me invite you to close your eyes.
[time=736] Trust me on this one now. I'll be right here when you come back.
[time=742] Close your eyes for just a minute, if you would. Seriously.
[time=746] And with them closed, let me ask you to begin to think about the Christmas season.
[time=753] In particular, envision yourself driving home about 6 p.m. in the evening.
[time=760] It's dark now. As you drive down the street that you live on, there are some decorations up, some lights are out.
[time=768] You pull to your own house and see it. Will you in your mind's eye how it's decorated?
[time=773] Now come inside the house and look at your Christmas tree, the way that you're so often decorated.
[time=782] And if you could have any music on that you wanted, what would it be?
[time=786] I mean, what would be the song and can you remember the melody and can you remember the lyrics of that song?
[time=793] And what would you be smelling? How do you want your house to smell as it so often does in the Christmas season?
[time=801] Now still with your eyes closed, I want you to envision tomorrow morning at 8 a.m.
[time=807] What are you wearing? Where are you at 8 a.m. on Monday morning? Are you in your car?
[time=814] Are you still in the house? Are you already at work? Will you be on an airplane?
[time=820] And how will you be feeling tomorrow?
[time=823] Energetic, tired, excited, or full of dread?
[time=831] Okay, come on back. Hope you enjoyed your trip.
[time=836] Now let's just together for a minute marvel at the human mind.
[time=840] I realized that without moving a muscle, without pushing a button, you took yourself back in time to another place.
[time=850] And then as you were asked, you took yourself forward to something that hasn't even happened yet.
[time=856] And your imagination allows you to see things that were there or will be there, to hear the sounds, to smell the smells, and even to feel some of the feelings.
[time=867] Some of you really hate Christmas, and so that was a painful exercise for you, and your mood shifted down.
[time=872] Some of you love it, and as you went through it, your mood shifted up a little bit.
[time=877] You see, it's your imagination. It's what allows an artist to look at a blank canvas, and have in their mind what they're going to do with that canvas, and go to the paint, and with brush, make selections, and suddenly over time, there it is.
[time=894] The imagination that allows a great military general to know what he's got, and by way of arsenal and personality, he's done all the study he can of his enemy, and he knows the topography and the terrain in which this battle is going to encounter.
[time=908] And he begins to map his entire strategy, and he imagines the whole thing, and if he does this, we'll do this, and then we'll go here, and then this will be a backup, and we've got to take care of that contingency.
[time=918] Imagination is what allows a teacher to anticipate her class, her third grade class, and know the subject matters, she's going to approach, and just exactly how she'll do it, and what object lessons will be there, and where they're going to lose their attention, and how she'll get it back.
[time=935] Imagination is a powerful thing, and it allows us to accomplish great and wonderful things, but there's a downside to imagination.
[time=948] There's a shadow side to our imagination. As capable as we are of thinking honorable and wonderful thoughts of integrity, our imagination allows us to see ourselves in God dishonoring and self-destructive scenarios.
[time=970] I won't do this, but I could ask you to close your eyes, and I could begin to walk you through the murderer where you are the murderer of someone in your life, and you could see it with the exact same clarity, you could feel the feeling, smell the smells, and see the sights with that same imagination.
[time=989] Remember, as a kind of a new guy into the workplace, I had a boss that I learned to loathe. I thought he was selfish and manipulative.
[time=999] I thought he made decisions for his own benefit at the expense of others, and sometimes those were at my expense, and there was this room that we would meet in, and I would begin to imagine what I wanted to do to him.
[time=1013] And I saw it as clearly, I never did it, but I would grab him by the lapels. He was a little smaller than I was. I'd grab him by the lapels, and I'd begin to read him the riot act on what I really thought about his character, and then I'd pick him up and I'd throw him through this big plate glass window and let him fall down a couple of stories and hit the pavement.
[time=1034] True confessions of a Baptist preacher. I see it, man. I did it over and over and over and over in my mind.
[time=1046] The point I'm trying to make is this. We have been given an imagination, and it's powerful, and we can commission that imagination to honorable and uplifting thoughts that produce those kinds of behaviors in our lives.
[time=1061] Oh, we can take that same imagination and commission it to dishonorable, destructive things.
[time=1067] And against this backdrop now of the imagination, Jesus steps with great courage onto the mind field of human sexuality.
[time=1078] He says, "I want to talk to you today about adultery." He says, "I want to talk to you today about lust."
[time=1087] If you have your Bible with you this morning, you can turn to Matthew chapter 5. We've been studying this chapter.
[time=1092] It's called "The Sermon on the Mount." It's an actual sermon that Jesus gave so many years ago using your imagination.
[time=1099] I invite you to see a large crowd that had gathered on this particular day. They were on a mountainside somewhere in Galilee.
[time=1106] And though the Bible doesn't specify this, my guess is that they kind of had found an amphitheater-type configuration of the hillside.
[time=1115] And they were all over that thing now, just absolutely packed, and in Jesus' day the great teachers would sit and not stand.
[time=1122] And so when that great crowd had gathered, he sat down and he began to answer a vitally important question in these people's minds.
[time=1131] The crowd that had gathered this particular day was a God-fearing crowd. They all basically believed in God.
[time=1137] And they also happened to have believed in the ten commandments that was their heritage. It was the Judeo-Christian ethic that they had been brought up in, or at least by then the Judeo ethic.
[time=1149] The question that was running front in their mind was this. How good do you have to be to get into heaven?
[time=1158] I mean, just put it down there straight where we can understand it. How good do you have to be to get into heaven?
[time=1166] And I am so thankful as we have been making our way through the Sermon on the Mount that Jesus chose not to answer this question in high theology terms and difficult to understand doctrinal issues.
[time=1178] I mean, no platitudes, no vague generalities. He grabs ahold of real life issues to answer that basic question how good you have to be to get into heaven.
[time=1188] And the issue or the topic he's got his hands on today is the issue of sex, adultery, and lust.
[time=1196] And I think that puts the cookies right down there on the shelf where we can all get ahold of it.
[time=1202] And I believe that when those people left that mountainside, there were no issues left unresolved in their mind as to, hey, how good do you have to be?
[time=1212] And I hope that at least in part today we can take a step towards helping you answer that question in your own mind based upon this Sermon on the Mount.
[time=1221] Well, let's read what Jesus says in his Sermon on the Mount, Matthew chapter 5 verses 27 and 28. Jesus said this, you have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery.
[time=1234] But I say to you that everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
[time=1248] You see, what he's saying is that there are a lot of you that have gathered here today on this mountainside in Galilee who are feeling pretty righteous.
[time=1255] You're feeling pretty acceptable to God because you have never committed adultery.
[time=1262] You have never committed the physical act of adultery, and that, my friends, is commendable.
[time=1268] You've never slept in the wrong bed. You've never violated the seventh commandment, but then he begins to say externally.
[time=1277] But in verse 28 he says, "But I say to you," and now he wants them to understand that God doesn't just look at the externals of life.
[time=1286] God has a penetrating, careful gaze right into the heart of each and every individual.
[time=1293] So he says, "But I say to you that some of you have been hopping from bed to bed in your heart and in your mind."
[time=1302] You've never done it physically, but you've been doing it very actively in your heart and your mind via your imagination.
[time=1309] He's saying that many of you have been regularly commissioning your imagination to place you in sexually immoral situations with a woman or a man who is not your spouse.
[time=1322] He's talking about powerful and moving mental sexual experiences where the imagination allows you to see yourself involved and hear the sounds and smell the smells and feel the feelings as powerfully as we might have just done with Christmas.
[time=1344] One is honorable, one is dishonorable. To reflect on great family times around the holiday season is an honorable use of your imagination, it's an honorable expression of your heart.
[time=1357] To envision yourself in sexually immoral situations is a dishonorable use of the imagination.
[time=1365] And so what Jesus is saying here is that there is more than one way to commit adultery.
[time=1371] You can do it naked in a hotel room with someone who is not your spouse, that's one way, or you can commit adultery, fully clothed without touching another human being in your chair at work, driving down the road in your car or sitting right here in this church.
[time=1392] Both forms of adultery, physical or mental, come from the same self-serving lustful heart and they both violate the law of God.
[time=1407] Jesus is saying you can flunk the seventh commandment fully clothed, you can be unfaithful to your wife or commit some sexual sin by how you fantasize in your heart.
[time=1419] Now in the time that remains this morning I want to do three things, address three issues that I think are relevant to this particular topic.
[time=1429] Number one I want to explain the difference or try to anyway, try to explain the difference between looking and lusting.
[time=1436] I think there's an enormous difference between looking and lusting and I'd like to from a biblical standpoint try to explain the difference.
[time=1442] Then I'd like to remind and for some caution that lusting is a high stakes game.
[time=1452] And then I'd like to close by talking about how to break the bonds of lust if you happen to be in them, breaking the bonds of lust.
[time=1462] What do I mean looking and lusting? What do I mean looking versus lusting? You notice in the Bible there in verse 28 Jesus says, but I say to you that everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her.
[time=1474] There is a kind of looking he is describing here, it is the kind of looking that has the intent of lusting.
[time=1482] Now when a man looks at a woman and a woman looks at a man, it's a very complex situation because God has made us sexual beings.
[time=1491] That's what becomes rather complicated because of that sexual component.
[time=1496] But what Jesus is saying is that not withstanding there is an honorable way to look at the other sex and then there is a dishonoring way to look at the other sex.
[time=1505] And let's start with the honoring way if you will.
[time=1508] I mean how is it that a man looks at a woman and honors God and honors her and honors his own heart and his own life?
[time=1515] The Bible would tell us that the beginning of that kind of honorable looking starts with the understanding that that woman is made in the image of God.
[time=1526] She is a reflector of the image of God.
[time=1531] And as a result she is multifaceted, she is multi-dimensioned.
[time=1537] For example, she has an intellectual side to her. God has given her a brain and it works and she thinks and she has views and she has beliefs and she has opinions about issues.
[time=1552] Because she is made in the image of God or vice versa if a woman is looking at a man because he is made in the image of God, he has an emotional side and his feelings can range from high to low, from joy to sadness, from sorrow to anger.
[time=1567] There is a relational side to this image bearer.
[time=1571] And so questions become what are your friendships and who are you in your relational world and how do you relate to other people and what was your family life like and how did you relate to your mother and your father and your siblings and aunts and uncles.
[time=1586] Who are you in terms of the relational component that God has built into your life because the image bearer also then has a spiritual side, you see.
[time=1597] And questions begin to arise in the mind of a good look, one to another. Who are you spiritually?
[time=1604] I mean do you believe in a God and if a God which God and what do you believe about that God and what does believing in God do for you and how does your spiritual side connect.
[time=1615] And then of course there is a physical side and that is observed as well.
[time=1620] And there may be an attractiveness there.
[time=1623] There may even be an appreciation for as the Bible calls it beauty and form and appearance.
[time=1629] However that connects with you.
[time=1632] But there's a way to look at a woman as a full orb and valued reflector of the image of God.
[time=1648] And that look uses the imagination to enter in to relationship with that person of the opposite sex in an honorable and God fearing way within the boundaries that are clarified in the Word of God.
[time=1665] An honorable way to look. The imagination then is commissioned in that individual and in that gaze.
[time=1672] How better can I understand that person's intellect, what they think about, why they choose what they choose, how better can I understand the emotional sense that that person has.
[time=1682] How better can I use my imagination to relate with that person, et cetera, et cetera.
[time=1689] What that gives birth to is very satisfying relationship.
[time=1696] Image bearer with image bearer looking in an honorable God fearing way.
[time=1703] Well what about lusting? How do we look when we lust?
[time=1710] We lust when we become riveted to the physical sexual side of that image bearer.
[time=1718] What all we see about that person is their body, their sex appeal.
[time=1725] When the dominant value about that person becomes their physical sexual side.
[time=1730] And the imagination is commissioned then to think about how that individual, that reduced individual now, just a sex object,
[time=1739] how that thing can satisfy my sexual needs or desires.
[time=1747] It goes from noticing to appreciating to a fixation to a fascination until finally mental sex is occurring, at least in the luster's mind.
[time=1762] Now you may engage in other aspects of that person in the lusting mode, you may use their intellect as an avenue to accomplish your end.
[time=1770] You may go through the emotional door of their soul to try to get your sexual needs gratified.
[time=1776] You may go through the spiritual receptor of their life and talk about religious things, but there's one agenda in that lustful heart.
[time=1786] There is one thing that is being pursued, there is one thing that is being long for, and there is just yet one dimension of that person that is of any interest.
[time=1796] That's what it means to lust.
[time=1802] There's a difference you know, between looking and lusting.
[time=1809] Now secondly, let me talk to you about the high stakes game that you get involved in when you get involved in lust.
[time=1817] And for some of you, this will be a reminder. For some of you, this may just be a first time caution.
[time=1821] For some of you, you have painful stories that you could tell.
[time=1827] One of the real price tags that is associated with lusting is that we become reductionary.
[time=1833] We become reductionary.
[time=1836] We are so riveted on the visual aspects of that individual and other individuals, so one dimensional that we reduce people from image bearers to mirror physical bodies to gratify sexual desires.
[time=1849] Instead of looking with the intent to understand and then bringing what you have to the equation to help another person along in life, you begin to be a user.
[time=1858] And all you see is the potential stuff that you can get out of that to gratify yourself.
[time=1865] You reduce them and you destroy, at least in your mind, that part of what it means to be an image bearer.
[time=1872] I'll never forget, when I was brand new in the ministry, serving on a large church staff that were responsibilities, one of those was to be pastor of the day.
[time=1881] Pastor of the day had to handle all the walk-in counseling that came to the church that day and all the phone calls that were of a spiritual nature.
[time=1888] I was on the phone with an individual who was broken in his heart, weeping over his past because he had given himself to lust.
[time=1898] He had given himself to lust in all kinds of different forms.
[time=1903] And he was describing now how the lust thing had so reduced people that all he would ever think about when he would have a conversation with another individual, male or female, would be the possibility of what sexual gratification that person could offer.
[time=1920] He had to force himself to carry on a normal conversation while the real conversation of his mind was all about the sexual possibilities that could happen here.
[time=1932] He broke down in tears when he said, "You know what? I've known about Jesus and I've been trying to pray to receive Jesus as my Savior, but every time I close my eyes and I try to pray to Jesus, I see a naked pornographic Jesus."
[time=1944] His imagination had been so carried into the realm of lust that for him to shut his eyes was to see naked people and if he was trying to pray to a person, the net person was naked.
[time=1956] He had stripped himself of so much of reality.
[time=1960] People are more than physical bodies.
[time=1963] People are opportunities for relationship, rich, meaningful, gratifying as you interact with all that God has made them to be.
[time=1973] To reduce a person down to a physical thing is a horrible deal.
[time=1978] I've noticed that women have a strong sense and a strong aversion to being reduced to a sexual object.
[time=1989] Women, unless it's some fantasy in a movie somewhere, you approach a woman with an overtly sexual demeaning remark and they recoil and they bristle and though they may not be able to fully express the emotion that they're displaying, it says if they're saying, "Hey, look, don't try to reduce me down to some sexual physical thing. I'm a human being."
[time=2013] Now, I've never had anybody approach me that way, so I don't know that I've, but I know in my relationship with my kids, maybe I get a glimpse of this somehow, I know that when I would come home from trips earlier on, I would try to bring a president of some kind for each child.
[time=2029] Oh, that was well received.
[time=2031] That was pretty exciting.
[time=2032] Did it once, did it twice?
[time=2033] About the third time I come home, all I hear is, "Hey Dad, what?
[time=2039] What'd you bring me?
[time=2041] What do you got?
[time=2043] What is it this time?" And I begin to recoil in my spirit.
[time=2048] And I begin to think to myself, "Hey, I'll tell you something right now.
[time=2051] I am a whole lot more than what I bring you." And we were built to enjoy something a whole lot more meaningful when I come home from a trip than what did I happen to pick up along the way, so I made a great decision.
[time=2064] I don't bring him anything ever anymore.
[time=2067] I never bring him anything now.
[time=2072] I just got home from a little trip two days ago.
[time=2075] I mean, now a two day trip.
[time=2076] I just got home last night about six o'clock, seven o'clock at night.
[time=2078] Let me tell you what happens.
[time=2080] I come through the door, and here they come, all five of them.
[time=2084] And you know, they get there at different times because they're coming from different parts of the house.
[time=2088] But when one of them gets there, there's the big hug, there's the big kiss, there's the big squeeze, there's looking into each other's eyes.
[time=2096] "Man, I'm glad you're home, Dad. Man, I'm glad I'm home. I missed you a ton." Boom, put that one down.
[time=2100] Here comes number two, then three, then four.
[time=2103] Now my teenage daughter, it's a little more sedated.
[time=2105] Hi. How are you?
[time=2109] Very warm, just slightly different.
[time=2114] Then we all sit down spontaneously.
[time=2116] Nobody said sit down, we just sit down at the table right there in the kitchen.
[time=2120] And I say, "Man, I wish you guys had been with me last couple days.
[time=2123] I went over here and then I did this, and then I saw this, and then I got to do this." And they're like, "Yeah, really, that's great." And then we get done talking about me and we go down the line.
[time=2130] Each and every kid begins to say, "Hey, what were the last two days like for you?
[time=2133] Where'd you win? Where'd you lose? What made you happy? What was it about?"
[time=2140] Reductionary behavior is destructive.
[time=2144] And it steals the real essence of life.
[time=2149] I wouldn't trade those times with my kids for all the presents in the world, and hopefully later they'll be saying the same thing, right?
[time=2158] But for now, they just got to trust that it's better for me not to be bringing little things home.
[time=2163] Some of you are saying all about the glitter, the glitter, and the wonder, and the excitement, and the adrenaline connected to those brief excursions into lust.
[time=2172] And God is saying, "No, you don't get it.
[time=2178] You're reducing yourself to see only a certain part of human beings, and you're reducing yourself to feel only a part of what I built you to feel."
[time=2188] Don't do that to yourself.
[time=2192] Lust is reductionary in nature, and it robs so much
[time=2199] of what life is really all about.
[time=2202] Let me tell you another danger that you're running into in the high stakes games of lust.
[time=2207] It's compulsive. It can reach compulsive levels.
[time=2213] What do I mean by that?
[time=2215] You can put yourself in situations, little choices along the way.
[time=2219] Some of the little choices you were seeing here, portrayed in the drama, you can put yourself in situations where the power of that lust engine inside of you overpowers your will, and you start making irrational and stupid decisions that have the possibility of forfeiting everything you care about.
[time=2239] Proverbs 7 is a story that's written from a father to a son.
[time=2243] And the father's like, "Hey son, let me tell you a few things about the compulsive nature and the destructive reductionary nature of lust.
[time=2252] And I want you to learn from some of my experiences, so you don't have to go through this story again on your own." And he opens his, he opens his proverb by saying, "Now listen to my son, do not even go down the street of the harlot.
[time=2270] Not, not, don't go in her house.
[time=2273] Not if you go in her house, don't do anything." He says, "Oh son, stay away from the street." He goes on to tell his little story.
[time=2282] He says, "Because if you get on the street where she lives, you're with an earshot of her voice.
[time=2287] And she's cunning.
[time=2289] And she's deceptive.
[time=2291] And that stuff will drip off her lips like honey.
[time=2294] And she'll begin to describe as he does in the proverb, she'll begin to describe her bed and how she's prepared in it.
[time=2301] And she'll describe the perfume that she has done her room in.
[time=2304] And she'll describe the way it's lit.
[time=2306] And then she'll even go so far as to describe the love-making that you go on there until all the night is over.
[time=2312] And then she reassures you with a notion that her husband has taken a large sack of money, which means he'll be gone for a long period of time.
[time=2320] In essence, we'll never get caught.
[time=2324] Don't even get on that street, my son.
[time=2327] Don't even get in with an earshot, much less eyesight.
[time=2330] Because she'll begin to get inside your imagination.
[time=2333] And once she starts working on your imagination, she can get it going in dishonoring self-destructive ways
[time=2339] and pretty soon it'll reach a fever pitch and you'll be out of control.
[time=2345] You will be out of control.
[time=2349] And so he says in this proverb, I quote, "Suddenly he follows her like an ox going to the slaughter,
[time=2358] or as one in the fetters to the discipline of a fool, until an arrow pierces through his inner man,
[time=2365] as a bird hastens to the snare so he does not know it will cost him his life."
[time=2373] Get on the street, listen to her voice, inflame your imagination, your lust takes over and suddenly you're gone.
[time=2385] He doesn't know it'll cost him his life.
[time=2387] Does he die in there? Does she kill him in there?
[time=2389] No, but she may as well have.
[time=2393] There he forfeits his reputation.
[time=2398] There he forfeits his integrity. There he gives her his hard earned money.
[time=2402] There he potentially forfeits his entire family.
[time=2406] And in our day and age he might even pick up a disease that'll kill him physically.
[time=2411] Oh, the high stakes of lusting.
[time=2417] So he concludes the proverb to his son, he says, "Don't let your heart turn aside to her ways to hear." He didn't talk about his feet. Don't even let your heart turn down her street.
[time=2428] Don't even let your imagination pretend you know what that street looks like.
[time=2432] And imagine yourself walking down and engaging her in conversation.
[time=2435] Don't let your heart turn aside to her ways and do not stray into her paths
[time=2443] because lust is compulsive.
[time=2446] It can reach levels where it overpowers your will.
[time=2451] It happens to be addictive because God has designed it to be such a meaningful experience between a husband and a wife and the proper biblical boundaries.
[time=2459] And I don't know how it works with the adrenaline rush and the stuff that happens inside the chemicals of your brain, but it can take you places and feelings of ecstasy that nothing else can take you, and that can become addictive.
[time=2471] It can also others tell us it is progressive, where what you had last time isn't enough. So more and more and more is required to feed the monster of lust within.
[time=2486] High stakes, my friends. Really high stakes.
[time=2493] Well, what about breaking the bonds of lust? What about walking free?
[time=2499] What about getting rid of all this stuff in our lives and saying enough is enough?
[time=2505] Jesus goes on. He says right after the verses we just read, he says this.
[time=2509] If your right eye makes you stumble, tear it out and throw it from you.
[time=2515] For it is better that one of the parts of your body perish than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.
[time=2521] Then he says this, if your right hand makes you stumble, cut it off.
[time=2525] Throw it from you for it is better for you that one of the parts of your body perish than your whole body go into hell.
[time=2531] What is he saying? Well, is he actually saying that if you want to solve your lust problem, rip your eye out?
[time=2538] I don't think so. I think Jesus understands that it is the point of the text that lust is a matter of the heart,
[time=2544] and you can rip both eyes out and still use your imagination to go places you shouldn't go.
[time=2549] Is he saying that you can rip your right hand off and solve? I don't think so.
[time=2557] What's he saying? He's not advocating physical self-mutilation.
[time=2564] What he's saying is do whatever you have to do to change your heart.
[time=2571] Do whatever you have to do to change the root of the problem which is your heart,
[time=2577] and if it's drastic measures then take drastic measures.
[time=2584] What are some of those measures I could take? If I really wanted to get this thing done, how would I do it?
[time=2590] Let me give you four things.
[time=2592] Number one, admit that you have a problem.
[time=2594] It's a radical step, and a lot of people are really reluctant to say, you know what? I have a problem.
[time=2602] I am ensnared in the fetters of lust, and it goes to the core of my being.
[time=2610] It's not some incidental issue in my life.
[time=2614] It's a reflection of my heart. I have a lusting problem.
[time=2618] Take the radical step and be willing to say that.
[time=2621] Say to yourself, I am one-dimensional.
[time=2625] I have let this lust go so far that now I barely see anything in another person except their sex potential.
[time=2633] And I, as an individual, enjoy very little else in my image-bearingness.
[time=2638] In other words, what I like about my intellect and what I like about my imagination and what I like about my feelings and my emotions are what they do to enhance my sex.
[time=2647] That's pretty much all I count on those things for.
[time=2651] Admit the problem.
[time=2654] Admit that your relationships have become weak and broken and superficial and trite because of the less problem.
[time=2662] Secondly, get rid of all access to lust-promoting material.
[time=2669] Get rid of all the material that you have access to that is lust-promoting in nature.
[time=2676] Some of you sitting here today have magazines that are hidden away.
[time=2680] Some of you here today have videos that are tucked behind places.
[time=2684] Some of you here today have made sure that your TV can receive certain channels
[time=2693] because it has lust-producing information on there.
[time=2697] Some of you have computers at home that allow you with certain things to connect to places and naked images
[time=2705] appear on your screen and phone-living color.
[time=2708] What I'm saying to you today is rip your eye out.
[time=2713] Rip your hand off.
[time=2715] When you leave this place, you get home and you throw it all out and you cancel whatever subscriptions have to be canceled
[time=2722] and you make sure your TV has whatever blocks it needs and you make sure that you throw away whatever it is in your computer that can allow you to do that stuff.
[time=2731] Because you need to come to the place where you say in the unaccountable moment when the lights are out
[time=2737] nobody's around I'm not wrong enough to resist this stuff.
[time=2746] Some of you have thousands of dollars invested in some of this stuff.
[time=2750] Take a radical step and throw it all out and when you do be careful that it doesn't happen to land in little hands.
[time=2760] You need to draw some lines that you will not cross. Some places you will never go.
[time=2767] Some conversations you will never have.
[time=2771] See a lot of people may look at this drama and say hey they didn't do anything wrong.
[time=2775] And Jesus is saying no no don't you get it it's in both of their hearts.
[time=2781] And it's in their hearts and now it's coming out of their lips and before they know it
[time=2787] draws some lines.
[time=2790] I know early in my ministry and even to this day I was pastoring and ministering at the Masters College.
[time=2797] There were 800 kids there 400 of them were attractive young women.
[time=2801] And I was happily married and I still am and I like my kids.
[time=2805] And I like to you know see that thing through all the way to the end.
[time=2810] But boy there were some attractive girls.
[time=2815] I said to my secretary who happened to have been Kelly Bird's mom.
[time=2819] And she was a wise and educated woman through the pain of her own life.
[time=2823] Her husband had committed adultery on her most of her life.
[time=2829] And I said to her I said Gail from time to time I feel an unusually strong attraction to some of these girls on this campus.
[time=2840] Now I have your permission to tell you about those specific individuals.
[time=2845] And with that I give you permission if you ever see me in any compromising situation.
[time=2851] I don't be by that hugging or something I mean driving in a car by ourselves or counseling her by myself.
[time=2856] If you see me in any way orchestrating private scenarios publicly private scenarios.
[time=2863] I give you complete permission to walk down the hall and tell all of my colleagues that I'm in trouble and I need help.
[time=2873] And get those guys to come rescue me before I give away everything I love.
[time=2881] You know what you got to get rid of all the access to lust promoting material.
[time=2889] Take drastic measures these two couple up here I mean these two people.
[time=2894] One of them should have been out of that department by yesterday.
[time=2898] Lose your job if you have to. Go work at a different place.
[time=2902] It's not totally physically resolved. It's ultimately a matter of the heart but there are circumstances you must be willing to avoid.
[time=2909] Number three, fill your mind with constructive stuff.
[time=2913] Fill your mind with constructive stuff. It's not enough to just say what you're not going to do.
[time=2918] You know you're on this diet and you're committed to losing some weight.
[time=2922] And it's eight o'clock at night and you say hey we're not eating after eight on this one.
[time=2925] And so you're in there watching TV and you say to yourself nope we're not eating a thing.
[time=2929] I'm not going to go eat that hot fudge sundae in there.
[time=2932] With all that hot syrup on it and all those nuts and that whipped cream.
[time=2937] You know those wonderful cookies that just got made in that milk I'm not going to eat those either.
[time=2942] I mean you can't resist that stuff the more you say you won't do it the sooner you're going to do it.
[time=2947] You have got to be able to say hey you know what I want to do?
[time=2951] I want to lose 12 pounds. I want to feel what it's like to get back in a 34 waist.
[time=2956] I want to see myself out by the pool with the kids this summer looking lean and mean.
[time=2961] And you begin to envision that stuff. You begin to say no by saying yes.
[time=2968] Now you say what am I supposed to say yes to in the category of lust?
[time=2971] Here's what you say yes to you begin to purpose in your heart to build meaningful God honoring relationships with people.
[time=2980] You say I am going to care about the intellectual side for the sake of that person not a possible avenue for sexual advantage.
[time=2989] I'm going to begin to care about their emotions.
[time=2991] I'm going to begin to care about who they are as an image bearer of God and offer what I have to enhance their life and a God honoring uplifting way.
[time=2999] That is the only way out of this stuff.
[time=3002] You can't just try to live in a vacuum.
[time=3004] You must begin to live positively pursuing the kinds of looking that God honors looking to serve looking to minister looking to further his values in their life.
[time=3018] Number four I've somewhat alluded to you may need a telefriend.
[time=3021] You just may need a telefriend.
[time=3023] You just may need to invite some accountability.
[time=3026] You just may need to get past that facade you've been holding onto for five or ten years because you see the lust engines getting bigger and stronger.
[time=3034] And you may just have to go outside your comfort zone and find a trusted friend and say you know what I'm struggling very very deeply with this issue.
[time=3042] And just in response to that message on Sunday I finally had the guts to throw all that stuff out but I want to go buy more.
[time=3049] And I'm like this little fledgling thing and I can't make it another day you gotta help me this is where I tend to fall this is what I'm thinking about doing and please protect me from that help me hold me up.
[time=3062] Be drastic.
[time=3064] Be drastic my friends it's a high state game.
[time=3067] Be willing to pull out your eye not literally.
[time=3070] Be willing to cut off your hand not literally.
[time=3072] Do whatever you've got to do today to get your heart right with God.
[time=3078] I want to close with just two final comments.
[time=3083] First of all this text is written about a man lusting after a woman.
[time=3088] And so I've talked mainly in that kind of a genre.
[time=3093] But you know women struggle with lust.
[time=3097] And some of you may be here today as a lady and you struggle with lust.
[time=3103] And some of you are here today and you struggle with that inverted lust.
[time=3108] Called homosexuality.
[time=3112] And you know what God cares about it.
[time=3115] And God knows about it.
[time=3117] And God wants to help you be victorious over it.
[time=3122] So I'm not just speaking to certain groups of males here today.
[time=3129] Secondly I want to say is you're out here today and you're in your heart.
[time=3133] You're agreeing with everything that's coming down the pipe.
[time=3136] You know the high prices.
[time=3138] You know the one dimensional nature.
[time=3140] A reductionary deal that happens in your heart to you and to who you look at.
[time=3144] I mean you see the whole thing painted out as clearly and you see these four steps and you say to yourself man I want to walk down that path.
[time=3151] I want to be free of the chains and the shackles of lust.
[time=3155] You're also honest enough to say you know you're not strong enough.
[time=3159] You're not even strong enough to tell a friend.
[time=3162] You're not strong enough to go out those doors and throw it away.
[time=3165] You know that the lust engine is too big even though right now in this atmosphere
[time=3171] you agree with everything I said.
[time=3175] Let me tell you something that's got to happen.
[time=3179] Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life.
[time=3184] This is not intended to be some cybernetic positive think message okay.
[time=3188] This is not something that I offer you independently of the very power of God who has the strength and the resources to help you change your life.
[time=3197] This is not so you can in your own power and your own strength kind of muscle up and get done with the problem.
[time=3203] You've tried that before.
[time=3206] The word of God says that if you want to find the freedom from lust and I might add the forgiveness of lust in days past what a thought to be forgiven huh.
[time=3219] You get that through the person of Jesus Christ.
[time=3223] You say you know what Jesus I have lusted and lusted and lusted and lusted and some of it's been in my head and some of it's been with my body and I deserve to go to hell for all that stuff.
[time=3235] But they tell me you can forgive me.
[time=3237] They tell me you can wash me and cleanse me because you died on the cross for my sins.
[time=3245] And then you say to Jesus and Jesus I know if I walk out these doors without your power and your strength without you living in my heart nothing's really going to change.
[time=3255] Oh there might be a 10 minute reform or a 24 hour reform or a 7 day reform but I know me but they tell me that you're big enough and strong enough that you'll take residence in my heart and through the power of the Holy Spirit you'll begin to give me the strength to apply those four principles that's what they're telling me and you know what it's true there's a whole bunch of us in this room that have accepted Christ as our Savior and whatever our struggle is whether it's lust or anger or materialism or selfishness or whatever our full orb stuff of sin is you know what we're finding out number one that Jesus forgives us and we have eternity because of his death on the cross. The second thing we've been finding out is he's changing us over time.
[time=3296] You can't do it without Christ.
[time=3302] Christ is sitting there saying man I really want to help because I want you to be free.
[time=3308] Well let's stand then for a closing word of prayer.
[time=3314] Let me invite you now to bow your heads just one last time and close your eyes again.
[time=3321] With your heads bowed and your eyes closed.
[time=3325] I want to talk again to you who I just was talking to.
[time=3329] You know this is about you and you know you can't do it on your own.
[time=3337] In a minute I'm going to pray a little prayer that will allow you.
[time=3343] If you follow along in your heart remember it's about your heart now.
[time=3347] If you can say these things from your heart Jesus is going to forgive you for every sin you've ever committed past and future.
[time=3359] If you can say this prayer and mean it from your heart Jesus is going to come into your heart and begin to give you the power to live differently and you can be free.
[time=3367] If you want to accept Jesus as your Savior right now right where you're standing you can do that.
[time=3375] Just by saying in your heart what I'm going to lead you in right now in this little prayer.
[time=3379] It goes like this.
[time=3383] My gracious God and Heavenly Father you look down on my life and you see the lust externally and internally and I confess to you my sin and I ask to be forgiven through Jesus Christ washed and cleansed through his death on the cross.
[time=3407] And I thank you for that forgiveness.
[time=3413] And my Heavenly Father you know that unless you help me through your Son and through the Spirit of God I will return back to that way of life as sure as the Son will rise tomorrow.
[time=3427] And so I ask the Spirit of God to give me the strength and the power from the inside out to change my heart and eventually my behavior so that I can live in a God honoring way so that I can treat people in God honoring ways.
[time=3447] Our Heavenly Father we thank you for hearing those prayers.
[time=3455] Prayers that are going up all over this place. Prayers from hearts that really want to change that really want to be different that really want to be free.
[time=3463] Thank you for being the kind of God that hears those prayers and for setting them on a path that leads to life.
[time=3471] We love you and we praise you for the forgiveness and the power you give us daily. We pray these things in Jesus name and all God's people said. Amen. God bless you.
[time=3487] Isn't that exciting just to know that God understands the human condition, he knows our frailty, he knows our sinfulness he knows how powerfully we can be drawn by our own lust into sinful situations where we compromise our integrity and where we break relationships with other people and break our promises I mean God knows all about that stuff and he's made provision for it in the person of Jesus Christ and he knows how we're supposed to live he knows how we can receive the most out of our lives if we'll just trust him and follow his will and I trust you're making that decision even today we'd love to have you be a part of our church if you need a church home come visit us sometime and until then God bless you.
