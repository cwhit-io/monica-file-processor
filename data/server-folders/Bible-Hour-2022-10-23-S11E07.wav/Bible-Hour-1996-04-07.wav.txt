[time=30] This is the Sunday morning worship service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] Today, Pastor Moore shares the most exciting part of the Christian experience, the resurrection of Christ.
[time=59] The message is entitled, "He is Risen." Please stay with us as he shares this wonderful truth from the Scriptures.
[time=65] Now let's join our service.
[time=89] One's broken down by the awful rain of sin.
[time=96] Trying with no hope, I'm dealing with this.
[time=103] When there came the precious man, who brought us God's salvation plan, he broke the chains
[time=128] and fed them hell, and gave us life, and made us web.
[time=138] And the Lord of God's great love, and the Lord of God's great love.
[time=164] Now reconciled the Father through Jesus, the Son of Arr.
[time=177] He next together with him, the glorified Lord.
[time=184] Now we are His workmanship, created in Christ's prime, made it by choice.
[time=192] He is every hand, and the rules he makes, and the nail shines.
[time=199] The precious man, dominion and power, lead to Jesus, who brought us from darkness, who
[time=215] brought us from darkness into his life.
[time=221] His heart was smart.
[time=228] Now let us celebrate.
[time=230] Celebrate, pray, and fill us God's great love.
[time=235] Sing mercy.
[time=237] Rejoice in the air.
[time=240] Lord, pray forever.
[time=242] Never, never.
[time=246] Lord, pray forever.
[time=251] Jesus, who brought us from darkness into his life.
[time=271] Rejoice, pray forever.
[time=276] Never, never, never.
[time=280] Jesus, who brought us from darkness into his life.
[time=692] Some of the Jewish leaders were there too.
[time=2383] I'm not ashamed to stand here this morning and be completely
[time=2389] counter to our culture and be completely politically incorrect when I say that Jesus Christ is the true and living Son of God and He is the only answer to the problem in our heart.
[time=2400] There is a God and that God loves you.
[time=2406] He pursued you at Christmas.
[time=2407] He died for you on good Friday and he was risen for your behalf on Easter.
[time=2412] The second thing I want to say is why I'm not ashamed.
[time=2419] And it comes out of that verse.
[time=2420] Look at it.
[time=2421] If we can get it back.
[time=2423] For I am not ashamed of the gospel.
[time=2427] Why?
[time=2429] Because it's the power of God for salvation.
[time=2435] The second thing I want to say to you this morning is that the gospel is the power, the very power of God for salvation.
[time=2445] Salvation means deliverance.
[time=2447] Salvation means change.
[time=2449] Do you have any idea how hard it is to change your life?
[time=2453] I mean, if you're honest with yourself, do you know how hard it really is to change your life?
[time=2458] I had like one of those horrible devastating, which I never got out of bed days last Friday, just two days ago, good Friday.
[time=2464] I had a wonderful time here in our service.
[time=2466] I had communion.
[time=2467] And then I've been looking forward to this thing.
[time=2468] Like all week, I was going to go and I did play golf with some buddies in the afternoon.
[time=2474] Well, you got to know something about me.
[time=2475] I'm longing deep inside for change in my golf swing.
[time=2480] That's true.
[time=2481] I am committed to it.
[time=2483] I want it.
[time=2484] I think about it.
[time=2485] I dream about it.
[time=2486] I practice for it.
[time=2488] And when I'm awake, I daydream about it.
[time=2490] I mean, it would be just wonderful if I could just like play in the '70s every time I step up to the T-box.
[time=2496] And every now and then, very rarely, every now and then I'll get out there on that practice T.
[time=2501] And I don't even know why, but all of a sudden the ball starts going like it's supposed to go uncharacteristically for me.
[time=2508] I mean, it like starts flying as it ought to fly, going like right at the target.
[time=2513] And that happened to me on Thursday at lunchtime.
[time=2515] I took my lunch break to get ready for this big golf thing, you know, on Friday.
[time=2518] And I was thinking I'm going to really be set.
[time=2519] I'm going to be tough.
[time=2520] I'm going to be in the '70s.
[time=2521] And it happened.
[time=2522] It was like somebody touched me with pixie dust or something.
[time=2525] And all of a sudden, every shot was just perfect.
[time=2529] And my friend was there.
[time=2530] And I said to my friend, look, it happened.
[time=2532] It finally happened.
[time=2533] I've changed.
[time=2534] [LAUGHTER] My golf swing has changed.
[time=2538] The thing I've been hoping for for 15 to 20 years has finally happened.
[time=2542] And I said, I'm never going back to the old way.
[time=2544] It'll never creep back into my life again.
[time=2546] That old horrible wicked swing that always keeps me in the '80s and sometimes in the '90s.
[time=2550] And I went back and barely fall asleep Thursday night.
[time=2554] Waiting.
[time=2555] Waiting to tee off on Friday.
[time=2557] And these guys, I was playing with, they know my game the way it is bad.
[time=2560] And I wanted to see the change.
[time=2561] And I wanted them to gawk.
[time=2562] I wanted them to stand in awe and amazement.
[time=2564] I actually wanted them to fall down a worship at my feet.
[time=2566] [LAUGHTER] You know, I had changed so significantly.
[time=2570] And I wanted to beat them on every hole with phenomenal shots.
[time=2573] Not by luck.
[time=2574] Not by chance.
[time=2575] Not by recovery.
[time=2576] Just precision golf right down the middle.
[time=2579] So worst day of my life.
[time=2581] [LAUGHTER] Absolute worst day of my life.
[time=2585] I'm telling you, gang, I had a good drive off the first tee.
[time=2588] A nice shot into the green on the second thing.
[time=2590] Barely scraped by the second and the third hole.
[time=2592] And then by the fourth hole, it was me again.
[time=2596] [LAUGHTER] And there I was.
[time=2601] It's so hard to change.
[time=2603] But the cycle goes something like this.
[time=2605] We become aware of what we don't like in ourselves.
[time=2608] We begin to have a sense of commitment to get to a different place.
[time=2612] And we can see it in our mind's eye.
[time=2614] We can envision what life will be like.
[time=2616] And I don't care if you're talking about your golf swing or your weight or your job or whatever it is, but we begin to envision what it could be like out there.
[time=2624] And then we begin to exert our personal energy and power to effect the said change.
[time=2631] And when we've given it all we've got, and we've tried as hard as we can try,
[time=2637] more often than not, though there may be a brief period of change, we find this inertia that drags us down into the place that we were before we started.
[time=2650] And then there comes that sense of hopelessness and depression.
[time=2656] And you say, "Well, I guess I'll just never, ever change." See that right there?
[time=2663] One of the reasons I'm not ashamed of the gospel is because it's the power of God.
[time=2668] It's the power of God.
[time=2672] Our country knows our problems.
[time=2674] Our politicians know our problems.
[time=2679] We know that we're in trouble as a country.
[time=2681] We know that our social fabric is tearing.
[time=2683] We know that our children are being physically and sexually abused.
[time=2686] We know that our homes are being ripped and ravaged by marriages that are falling apart and couples that can't work things out and the pain and the sorrow there is unbelievable.
[time=2694] We know that we're in trouble financially with our national debt.
[time=2697] We know that we have got so many problems that we don't know what to do with them all.
[time=2701] We don't know where to start.
[time=2702] We had a bunch of guys just get elected to the Congress of the day.
[time=2704] They promised it 100 days they were going to fix a lot of them.
[time=2706] And they found out it's harder to do than they thought.
[time=2710] There's no shortage of awareness of our problems.
[time=2712] And I'll suggest to you, there's no shortage in your heart and your life of the problems that you need to get fixed in your life.
[time=2718] And maybe you've been dreaming about how those can change.
[time=2723] And maybe you even experimented a little bit with this inertia thing, this personal energy that says I've got what it takes to get rid of this in my life.
[time=2733] And then maybe you've cycled right back into my bad Friday experience.
[time=2740] Let me tell you something, the Gospel, the Gospel has the power of the omnipotent God to deliver you.
[time=2750] Now what do I mean by that?
[time=2752] I don't want to be viewed as I'm making some grandiose quick fix promises.
[time=2757] But this is what the Bible tells you.
[time=2760] When you come to accept the Gospel, when you come to pray to receive Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior,
[time=2769] and you say no, no, no, no, I do believe that God pursued me at Christmas becoming the form of human flesh.
[time=2776] I do believe the wages of sin is death, but I believe that Jesus Christ paid for that on Calvary that day on my behalf.
[time=2783] And I believe that he was risen the third day.
[time=2786] I accept him as my personal Lord and Savior to deliver me from my sin.
[time=2790] Something wonderful happens.
[time=2791] We're all a bunch of things. Let me just give him to you very briefly.
[time=2793] This is the whole thing right here.
[time=2795] Number one, God forgives you. God smothers you in his grace.
[time=2799] He says, I can't even remember your sins. What sins?
[time=2802] You know the violations that you've done against my holiness that would send you to hell for all eternity?
[time=2805] Because you put your faith in my son Jesus Christ.
[time=2808] I forgive you totally and completely, and I forget you.
[time=2811] He says in his Bible that I will separate you as far as the east is from the west from your personal sins.
[time=2817] So that when you stand before him on Judgment Day, he will not only not see your unrighteousness,
[time=2823] but he gives us the very righteousness of his son.
[time=2826] And we stand there as if we'd never sinned in all of our life, even though we have almost every day of it, because God gives us the righteousness of his son.
[time=2835] That's called grace, my friends. That's called forgiveness.
[time=2838] And the only way to get forgiven by God is by accepting his son as your personal Lord and Savior.
[time=2845] But it doesn't stop there.
[time=2846] I mean the energy of being forgiven, the freedom, the weight that comes off, the sense of unbelievable.
[time=2852] I can breathe again, and it's clear outside again.
[time=2855] And I can see again as you experience the reality of what it's like to be forgiven for your sins because of what Christ did on the cross.
[time=2862] It's just unbelievable.
[time=2864] But he goes beyond that.
[time=2866] He says now, I'm going to soften your heart.
[time=2870] You know how your heart gets hard?
[time=2872] And your heart gets calloused?
[time=2874] And you get angry?
[time=2875] And you get defensive?
[time=2876] And you get shut down?
[time=2878] And you hate God?
[time=2879] And you hate the people in your world?
[time=2881] And you hate your life?
[time=2883] And your heart begins to calcify over?
[time=2887] One of the things that God does when he saves you is he begins to cultivate the soil of your heart.
[time=2892] He begins to break up the crusty stuff.
[time=2894] He begins to make it soft again.
[time=2896] He begins to let you experience the wonder of forgiveness.
[time=2899] And that softened heart begins to confess sins from their heart.
[time=2903] And you begin to ask forgiveness of God.
[time=2905] That softened heart begins to believe again that there is a God and that he does love you and that he does have a plan for your life.
[time=2911] That softened heart begins to hold a hope for the future that things are going to be okay.
[time=2918] Power of the gospel changes people.
[time=2922] Because number one, there's forgiveness and grace from God.
[time=2924] Number two, he softened your heart.
[time=2925] And number three, he gives you a new way of looking at his word.
[time=2928] For most people, this is an antiquated stupid old book about stories that happened in somebody else's life.
[time=2936] Our culture calls it narrow.
[time=2940] Our culture calls it everything but what it is.
[time=2943] It happens to be the true and living Word of God.
[time=2947] And I promise you today that if you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, this book will come alive to you.
[time=2954] It will teach you how to love your spouse.
[time=2958] It will teach you how to raise your children.
[time=2961] It will teach you how to use your money in a God-honoring way.
[time=2964] It will teach you to have a compassion for other people.
[time=2967] It will teach you to develop your character growth as you go through trials instead of explaining your dysfunctional realities because of trials.
[time=2979] This will become to you the very bread of life and you will eat and drink of its truth and its principles and it will never do you wrong.
[time=2989] It's one of the ways that God uses his power to change us.
[time=2992] Forgives us by his grace, he softens our heart, he begins to open our eyes to the Word of God so we can study and read and learn and live by its truth.
[time=3002] He does another thing he fills us with his Holy Spirit.
[time=3005] I don't understand this, I don't understand this, I don't pretend to understand this but I know it's there.
[time=3010] The Bible says that when you pray to receive Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, he sends the third member of the Trinity.
[time=3016] God the Father stays in heaven, Jesus died and is risen again and sits at the right hand of the throne of God.
[time=3021] But then there is this thing called the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, and God promises and does send the Holy Spirit into your heart the moment you pray to receive Christ.
[time=3032] And he begins to lead you, he begins to prompt you, he begins to convict you of your sin and give you desires to love people and to give of your life.
[time=3042] It's the most amazing thing, it is power from God that gets put inside your heart and allows you to live the kind of changes that you want to live.
[time=3054] Then he gives you one of the things that's just so amazing, he gives you community, he gives you other brothers and sisters in Christ.
[time=3061] That have also accepted Christ. And what you get to do with these other brothers and sisters in Christ is they get to bear your burdens, and you get to bear their burdens.
[time=3069] You begin to love each other at a core level, a deep level, and you trust each other because you're both admitted that you're fellow sinners and you've been forgiven by the grace of God.
[time=3077] And you begin to develop bonding relationships that mean more to you than anything else in the world.
[time=3083] That there is another person in this city, or three, or four, or a thousand, some of which you get very, very close to and they mean more to you than anything.
[time=3093] Because they love you and they hurt when you hurt and they cry when you cry and they pick you up when you fall down and they rejoice when the good things happen.
[time=3101] And you see, we weren't built to walk through life all alone, surrounded by people but totally alone because we can't trust anybody.
[time=3111] The power of God is in the gospel to deliver you.
[time=3121] Let me say one third thing before we close here.
[time=3124] Third thing I want to say about the gospel number one is I'm not ashamed of it. I really think it's true.
[time=3130] The second thing I want to say about it is that I'm not ashamed of it because I know that it changes people's lives.
[time=3135] I've seen it change people. I've seen it change my own and I've seen it change a whole lot of people who are sitting here today.
[time=3140] But the third thing I got to tell you, which I love about it, look at the verse again.
[time=3145] For I'm not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for the salvation of who everybody.
[time=3152] Man, this is non-exclusive stuff.
[time=3156] Everybody can know the delivering power of God through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
[time=3164] You see, what do you mean by everybody? Is this a racial thing? Are you talking about black versus white?
[time=3168] Are you talking about the Chinese? Are you talking about the Russians? Yeah, I am, but that's not really what I want to talk about.
[time=3172] It includes those people. Let me tell you what I mean by everybody.
[time=3175] Let me give you a little list of categories that the gospel is big enough to save.
[time=3180] You ready for this one? Fornicators.
[time=3183] The gospel is big enough to deliver you from the power of infidelity and sexual misconduct.
[time=3192] Another one, idolaters. People who worship things that are not worthy of worship.
[time=3198] The power of the gospel is strong enough to deliver you from living your life for things that are not worthy of your life.
[time=3203] Your job, your money, your house, your cars, your vacations.
[time=3207] They can free you from the idolatry of worshiping at altars, contemporary altars that are not worthy of your worship.
[time=3216] Another one is adulterers. The gospel is powerful enough both to forgive and to utterly change the lives of people who have committed adultery and other people.
[time=3226] It's the most wonderful thing. It goes on to say, effeminate and homosexuals.
[time=3231] The gospel, the power of God that is bound up in the gospel that Jesus pursued us and then He died for us and He was raised from the dead on our behalf.
[time=3240] That very gospel has the power to free people from homosexuality, just another form of sexual misconduct.
[time=3247] It goes on to talk about thieves and the covetous and the drunkards and the revilers and the swindlers.
[time=3253] He lists off all these things and then He says, "And such were some of you." He's talking to a bunch of believers in a city called Corinth and they were all those things.
[time=3262] Before they had come to Christ, His personal Lord and Savior, they were fornicators and idolaters and adulterers.
[time=3267] They were effeminate. They were homosexuals. They were a bunch of thieves. They were covetous.
[time=3271] They were drunkards. They were revilers. They were swindlers. They just look a whole lot like the people of Fort Wayne.
[time=3277] Just a whole lot like us. They look just a whole lot like us.
[time=3281] And then they met Christ. And then they met Christ.
[time=3286] And the Bible says, "And such were," past tense, "such were some of you, but you've been washed in the blood of Christ."
[time=3295] I don't know what you're struggling with today.
[time=3299] I think we get agree in a couple things. I got no problem figuring that most of us in this room want change in our life.
[time=3306] True? You've got things in your life you want to get rid of, don't you? And you have for a long time.
[time=3312] You've got things in your life that are eating away at you. You've got things in your life that are taking a bigger chunk of your life every day you're on this planet.
[time=3318] And you're probably a little bit fearful of where this train is going to end up.
[time=3322] We probably all agree to that. Now we've got some choices. You've got a plan to deal with it.
[time=3328] You're going to go back to self-help stuff.
[time=3331] You're going to count on the government to change legislation, and that's somehow going to change your heart.
[time=3335] You're going to educate yourself out of this thing. What's your plan?
[time=3340] And all I'm suggesting to you today is that whatever plan you've got, whatever resources you think you have, I think you know by now they're not enough.
[time=3350] And God stands with open arms saying I've got the power to change your life.
[time=3355] I have the power to change your life in spiritual terms.
[time=3362] I can forgive you. I can wash you. I can cleanse you. I can give you my word. I can fill you with my spirit.
[time=3367] I can give you other brothers and sisters, and you will not even recognize yourself in five years. You'll be so different.
[time=3375] And it doesn't matter what you're struggling with. He's big enough to do it.
[time=3382] So what is the gospel? Christ pursued. Christ died. Christ was risen from the dead.
[time=3390] What does it mean to you and me? Freedom.
[time=3394] If we accept Christ as our personal Lord and Savior, we have freedom. We can be delivered over time through hard work, but through the power of God from the stuff that is eating away at us.
[time=3404] Who can be delivered? Everybody can be delivered.
[time=3409] You said some kind of power. That's some kind of power. How do I know he's strong enough for that?
[time=3415] Well, let me give you one more slide here before we go. And this I won't take as long with. Let me give you just one more slide.
[time=3422] Look at this one. This is just a few verses earlier in the book of Romans chapter 1. It says this.
[time=3426] Speaking about Christ, Christ was declared the Son of God with power by the resurrection from the dead, according to the spirit of holiness, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[time=3437] Let me give you, as I close, the one great dividing line that exists between Jesus Christ and every other religious leader who has ever lived and whoever will live.
[time=3447] Where is Buddha today? He's in his grave. Where is Confucius today? He's in his grave.
[time=3461] Where is every other religious leader who has ever walked the face of the earth today in the grave?
[time=3473] The point of Easter, my friends, is that the power of God, as you see, it was the power of God who raised Jesus Christ from the dead.
[time=3482] And it is that same resurrection power that he used to raise Jesus from the dead, that he is willing and desirous to bring the bear upon your life, to raise you from the spiritually dead, and to give you spiritual life and spiritual freedom.
[time=3501] And it's yours for the taking. It's yours for the taking.
[time=3506] Let me invite you to stand as we close in prayer.
[time=3532] In a moment, I'll give you our address so you can receive a copy of Lessons on Assurance.
[time=3536] You can also receive a cassette copy of today's message. Just ask for tape number 1755, or mention the message by Pastor Moore entitled "He is risen."
