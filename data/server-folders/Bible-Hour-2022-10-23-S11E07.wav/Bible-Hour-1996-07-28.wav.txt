[time=30] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=53] One of the most frequently misunderstood statements Jesus ever made was, "Judge not lest you be judged." Stay with us today and find out what he really meant.
[time=62] Now let's join our service.
[time=89] [MUSIC - 326 seconds]
[time=445] - Hello, I'm Dr. McKenzie.
[time=462] So what seems to be the problem, Samantha?
[time=466] - Well, it's my eye, Doc.
[time=468] - Well, let's take a look here.
[time=471] Okay.
[time=476] I can see that.
[time=479] How long has it been like this?
[time=481] - You know, I really don't know, but I was trying to get a speck out of my brother's eye, and he pointed it out to me.
[time=487] - What do you think it is?
[time=490] - Definitely a case of apolumbaritis.
[time=494] - Apolumbaritis?
[time=497] - Mm-hmm.
[time=498] - What exactly is that?
[time=500] - In medical terms?
[time=501] - Yes, please.
[time=503] - Well, it means my cruise to the Bahamas is paid for.
[time=509] - It's serious, huh?
[time=511] - Nah, just a pleasure trip.
[time=513] - I mean my eye, Doc.
[time=515] What exactly is this apolumbaritis thing?
[time=520] - Well, it means that you have a two-by-four stuck in your pupil.
[time=529] - No wonder my lens keeps popping out.
[time=533] - All right, Doc.
[time=535] I want the prognosis and give it to me straight.
[time=540] - Well, we could leave it in, but then you'll get splinters every time you blink your eyes.
[time=546] - Any alternatives?
[time=549] - We could remove it.
[time=550] - Oh, that had hurt.
[time=553] - You really don't have a choice in the matter.
[time=556] The longer you wait, the more you risk permanently damaging your vision.
[time=563] So, what'll it be?
[time=566] Remove it?
[time=567] Or do you go around the rest of your life listing the color of your eyes as knotty pine?
[time=574] - Go ahead, Doc.
[time=576] Schedule me for surgery as soon as possible.
[time=579] I guess I can take it.
[time=581] - Surgery?
[time=582] - You don't need surgery.
[time=585] - Topolumbaritis is a condition that you can treat yourself.
[time=589] - Myself?
[time=591] - How?
[time=593] - Well, do you remember that spec you were trying to get out of your brother's eye?
[time=598] - I know right where it is and exactly how to extract it.
[time=603] - Then just use that same bold determination when you work on your own eye.
[time=608] - You've got to be kidding.
[time=610] - Well, I could never survive the procedure I have in mind for him.
[time=614] - Now, Samantha, do you want that beam out of your eye?
[time=618] Or do you want woodpeckers following you around the rest of your life?
[time=625] - Well?
[time=628] - Okay.
[time=631] I'm going to go home right now and give it a try.
[time=635] - Good.
[time=636] - You know, ophelumbaritis is really quite common.
[time=640] When it comes to seeing our own faults, most of us are visually impaired.
[time=645] - Well, thanks for your time, Doc.
[time=647] - Oh, don't mention it.
[time=649] And don't forget to send me a postcard from the Bahamas.
[time=652] - Ah, sure thing.
[time=654] Oh, I'll staple it to my build.
[time=658] - Jesus said, do not judge or you too will be judged.
[time=663] From the same way you judge others, you will be judged and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
[time=668] Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own?
[time=673] How can you say to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?
[time=680] You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.
[time=690] - Let me invite you to open your Bible this morning to Matthew chapter 7.
[time=694] We've been studying the Sermon on the Mount and it began in Matthew chapter 5.
[time=699] And we've studied chapter 5, chapter 6, and now this morning we come to chapter 7.
[time=707] And as you know, a long time ago, a very real group of people with real problems gathered on a mountainside.
[time=715] And they had come to hear what, at least in their lifetime, had been known as the greatest teacher of all time.
[time=723] And they loved to hear him speak. They would follow him around.
[time=727] They would wait hours on end, I'm sure, just at the hoping for another teaching opportunity because he taught with incredible color.
[time=735] His illustrations were always so alive to them, so real, so fresh, so tangible.
[time=741] He spoke with authority. The Bible tells us that they were often in awe of him because when he spoke, he spoke as no other for he spoke as authority.
[time=750] He wasn't relating as the scribes and Pharisees did, truths they might have gained from the Word of God.
[time=755] He was God, and so when he spoke, it was true, and there was a ring of that in their ears in his delivery, in his demeanor, and from his heart and his life.
[time=765] But I think one of the reasons that people followed him around to hear him speak was because he had a way of speaking to the issues that really connected with their life.
[time=775] They didn't find him teaching on ethereal concepts that didn't apply to them.
[time=779] Every time he seemed to open his mouth, it was as if he had taken a hard, long look into their life and began to speak issues in truth that dealt with the very things they might have been struggling with.
[time=790] And on this particular occasion, though, he did not announce it up front as he begins to preach, as he begins to cover the various issues in this sermon, you take a step back from it and suddenly you realize
[time=803] that in chapters five and six on the Sermon on the Mount, he covers every major category of life that could concern them.
[time=812] I mean, if they came with a question in their mind, "I don't like my life. I wish my life were better. How do I make life work? What was I designed to do?
[time=819] How does this whole thing happen?" In the first two chapters of his sermon, and it only goes three chapters, he covers all the significant issues of life.
[time=828] He begins, and you might turn back to Matthew chapter five, he begins by telling us the proper view of ourselves.
[time=836] I mean, if your life is going to work, if life is going to go right, I mean, if life is going to have meaning and purpose, one of the foundational elements is, "How do I view myself? Who am I? What am I?"
[time=849] And if you were with us, you know, he began in verse three by saying, "Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[time=858] Now, the Lord throws this message against the backdrop, a canvas, if you will, the teaching, the lives, the behavior of the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=869] And all the way through his sermon, he is correcting, he is instructing, he is sharing the other perspective to the teachings and the life pattern of the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=880] And I don't know about you, but as I have continued to study the sermon on the Mount, I have found that my life connects often and very closely with that of the scribes and the Pharisees.
[time=891] As I see the error in their life, as I see the error in their thinking, as I see the ways in which they have gone awry, there is this uncanny sense in which I see myself in their error.
[time=905] For example, as he opens up in the view of yourself, how does that look? And the scribes and the Pharisees had become proud.
[time=914] They had become arrogant. They somehow had lost that real sense of personal conviction and the visceral feelings of sin before Holy God.
[time=927] They may have had it at one point, but they moved away from it until they became indifferent to their sin, and their sin became a friend, and it was just kind of a traveling companion, and so a real sense of brokenness and conviction over personal sin did not mark them.
[time=941] It did not mark their teaching, and it did not mark their life.
[time=946] And the Lord says, "That's an erroneous view of yourself. You'll never get your life to work as I designed it with short of a profound sense of your own sinfulness."
[time=957] Verse 3, when he says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit." He does not mean physically poor. He does not mean financially poor.
[time=963] He means the spiritual bankruptcy of sensing your own sin, standing before a righteous and a Holy God.
[time=970] And I would add, he is not talking about some type of inward meditation and where we begin to excuse ourselves and the fulfillment of our responsibilities because we're such horrible people and we walk around with our shoulders now.
[time=981] He's not talking about that. He's talking about a very real and a very genuine and a very earnest conviction over the degree to which you and I have violated the holiness of God.
[time=992] And that leads to something. In verse 4, "Blessed are those who mourn." It's just not an intellectual understanding.
[time=999] It has an emotional outlet. There is a sense of sadness. There is a sense of sorrow. There is a sense of weeping.
[time=1005] There is a sense of true contrition, heartfelt contrition over personal sin.
[time=1010] It says, "You want to know how to view yourself? View yourself as a violator of the holiness of God which provokes an unsolicited mourning for the degree to which you violated him and the people around you."
[time=1021] Which led him to verse 5, where suddenly people find themselves being gentle, so convicted of your own sinfulness, so broken over it that there comes a spontaneous gentleness with other people.
[time=1034] This is a relational term. When it's talking about not asserting your own rights, it's this graciousness which some people have more than others and they allow other people to violate them, to step on their toes, to move into their turf,
[time=1050] and not take revenge. That, of course, stems from this sense of brokenness.
[time=1057] And then it led him to verse 6. These very same people are full of an unbelievable passion.
[time=1062] It's described as a hunger and a thirst. It's an all-consuming passion.
[time=1067] And it is not for material things. It is not for their own personal glory. It is not for their personal accomplishments.
[time=1072] It is instead for the very righteousness of God.
[time=1076] So broken are they over their own sin? So emotionally tapped are they as they sense the degree to which they have violated God?
[time=1084] That there is this, again, unprovoked and unsolicited gentleness to people, and the only passion you can seem to rise in them is the passion they have to be different than they are, to be more like God, to be holy, to whatever degree they can attain.
[time=1101] So you want to know how to view yourself? You want to know the beginning of the blocks that you put in place in building a foundation for life?
[time=1108] View yourself as one who has broken over your sin, gentle in relationships, and the real passion and pursuit of your life is for righteousness.
[time=1119] Then he switches the subject. He says, "But I've got to give you another foundation." The first one is how you view yourself. Let me give you a view of other people.
[time=1127] If you want to know how I want you to view people, if you want to know how I created you to evaluate yourself in a relationship with other people, he takes that discussion up in verse 21, and there's a whole litany of them.
[time=1139] He talks about don't think that you're holy, don't think that you're right just because you haven't murdered somebody, evaluate yourself on an internal level as to whether or not you've been angry.
[time=1150] He goes from there to lust, and he says, "Don't think you haven't violated another person just because you haven't committed adultery with them, the physical act of sex.
[time=1158] You violated them when you've lusted for them. You violated your relationship with people when you wanted to commit that act with them."
[time=1165] He goes from there to the whole issue of divorce, and it was common, and it was a plague in that particular day as it has become in our own day, and described in the Pharisees were right in the middle of it.
[time=1177] They would become very angry in their heart with people, particularly I think their wives.
[time=1183] They would then look at other women and lust for them, but wanting to maintain the facade of religious commitment, they would not just commit adultery, they would then give her a writ of divorce, oftentimes for no substantial reason whatsoever, so they could then lust and then, quote unquote, legitimately marry and be religiously sound in a new marriage.
[time=1204] And the Lord says that is not at all the basis for divorce.
[time=1208] There are very limited basis for divorce when adultery has occurred, or if you've married an unbeliever and they desert you and leave you, in those cases there is grounds for divorce, but otherwise my friend, a commitment is a commitment and for you to be solid.
[time=1220] For you to have one of the fundamental building blocks of life, you must treat people from your heart with dignity and commitment and honesty and integrity.
[time=1230] So stop being angry at people, which defaces the character of God in them, and stop lusting after them, reducing an image bear into a thing for your own personal gratification.
[time=1239] And when you're tired of being in a relationship with one of them in particular, your spouse, stop divorcing them to have another.
[time=1247] But the problem of commitment went far beyond marriage and it went into all their relationships.
[time=1251] They didn't want to have to stand true to their word for one second longer than it was not in their best interest.
[time=1256] And so they became religious liars. They developed a system of oath, which would allow them to, in a very veneer way, break their commitments and still have the facade of religious commitment.
[time=1269] And if you were here with us when we talked about that, they said, "Well, I don't have to keep my promise to you because I only swore by the footstool of God's feet or by the Jerusalem or by the city of the Great King.
[time=1279] I didn't swear to you my word based upon God himself." And it was a ridiculous way, kind of like my fingers were crossed behind my back, of consistently and regularly breaking their commitments in their own selfish interests and yet trying to maintain the facade of religious maturity and commitment.
[time=1296] It was a sham. And the relationship for falling apart went even further.
[time=1302] In verse 38, he brings up the issue of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. And what that passage is about is personal vengeance.
[time=1310] They were an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth on a personal level.
[time=1314] And if you did one little thing to step into my area, to step on my toe, to infract upon my personal self-esteem, or my rights, or you move in on my territory in one small way or another, I will come after you with a sense of holy vengeance taking an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
[time=1331] And it was destroying their society. It was destroying their relationships.
[time=1336] And that was never what the verse was intended in the Old Testament that was given for government to limit the amount of retribution government would bring upon its citizens to make sure that the punishment met the crime.
[time=1347] But they had moved it into the personal arena to justify personal vengeance.
[time=1352] So Lord says, you want to know how to view yourself as a broken, truly heartfelt, contrite person who is gentle to other people and has a great passion for righteousness.
[time=1364] You want to know how to evaluate yourself with other people and how to do relationships?
[time=1369] Then let go of the anger, repent of the lust and the divorce and the lying and the personal vengeance and instead, evidence of heart that is full of forgiveness.
[time=1377] That is full of purity, no lusting here, just pure love for the other person.
[time=1382] If you give your word, keep it until you die and be as honest as the day is long.
[time=1388] It gives a third category.
[time=1391] Building block number three is how you view God.
[time=1394] And anyone would admit that if you're going to kind of have your life, go the way God intended it.
[time=1399] There would be some instruction needed on how you treat God.
[time=1402] And what the Lord says in chapter six, that first three paragraphs is you guys have fallen into the same thing that every other person has ever fallen into who has ever tried to be in relationship with me.
[time=1413] It's called externals.
[time=1415] It's called religion degenerating to the externals.
[time=1417] It's called just going through the motions.
[time=1419] It's called just kind of walking through the paces of your religious experience, but your heart is far from me.
[time=1425] And this has no longer been an expression of your love for me and my love for you and kind of an exciting celebrating the reality that worked together in a love relationship.
[time=1433] And it's just degenerated down now to where you have some routines and patterns in your life that constitute religion.
[time=1439] They were doing that when they were giving.
[time=1441] They were doing that when they were praying and they were doing that when they were fasting.
[time=1444] And those were just samplings out of their religious experience.
[time=1447] And so the phrase our Lord used over and over again was, when you do it, do it in secret.
[time=1452] When you do it, do it in secret.
[time=1455] In other words, let it be the personal commitment of you to me and me to you as you give back to me part of your income.
[time=1462] You don't want anybody else to know about that.
[time=1464] Don't tell anybody you're giving amounts because then you'll be distracted and it'll be about them instead of being about us.
[time=1469] And when you pray, don't make a scene.
[time=1472] Don't try to draw attention to yourself because then it'll be about what they think about you instead of about what I think about you and what you think about me.
[time=1479] Can't we just have a genuine relationship?
[time=1483] And when you fast, which was kind of a part of their religious culture and it's not so much a part of ours, but any one of ours going to church or serving the children's division or whatever you happen to do around here.
[time=1493] Whenever you evidence a little extra commitment in your devotion to God, don't do it so people can see you.
[time=1498] Do it because it's devotion to me.
[time=1504] Well, then he comes to the fourth major category of life, how you view yourself, how you view other people, how you view God, and then this last one, that's how you view things.
[time=1513] He says, that's right. You know, I mean, you are stuck on this earth. It is a temporal place and there are things.
[time=1517] And how are you going to relate to the things that are on the earth?
[time=1521] And that would be instrumental. That would be critical in understanding how to live, wouldn't it?
[time=1524] Because so much of our lives are bound up in things.
[time=1527] And he gives two categories. He says, for those of you who have luxury, verse 19 of chapter 6, do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth.
[time=1535] For those of you who have an abundance, I mean, you have so much you don't know what to do with it, whether to treasure it or to give it away or to use it for some cause.
[time=1543] His comment to those who have great luxury is, don't let the passion and the pursuit of your life be bound up in temporal earthly things.
[time=1550] Because those things are destroyed by the rust and the thieves break in and steal them.
[time=1555] He says instead to use money as a tool, I mean, if you've got extra money, use it as a tool.
[time=1560] You need to provide for your family, you need to provide for your future, and as you have opportunity, you need to give to the poor and support the mission of the church.
[time=1567] And don't become the slave of money, make money your slave.
[time=1571] And you continue, even though you've been given much, to pursue the eternal things of the kingdom of God.
[time=1577] And then he has another category of people who might not have enough to eat.
[time=1581] He shifts the conversation in verse 25 to people who are anxious about what they would eat, what they would drink, or what they put on their body.
[time=1587] I mean, this is low-level poverty existence, and he's saying you're on the other end of the spectrum, and to you people, listen now, don't be anxious for that stuff.
[time=1595] You happen to have a heavenly Father who can clothe the lilies in the field and who can feed the birds, he'll take care of you.
[time=1601] So whether you have a lot of things or whether you have almost no things, don't let the things be the issue.
[time=1607] I'm the issue in both cases, if you have a lot of things, then use that sphere of influence and invest in the kingdom of God at that level.
[time=1615] And if you have almost nothing and you don't know where the next meal is coming from, use that as an opportunity to trust me and to worship me and to follow me and to see me provide in your life.
[time=1625] It's amazing, isn't it?
[time=1627] Two short chapters, and the Lord has covered every major issue in life.
[time=1633] How you're going to view yourself, how you're going to view yourself and other people, how you're going to view yourself and God, and how you're going to view yourself and things.
[time=1644] And so now what he's done in these first two chapters is he has established the standard, if you will.
[time=1650] The standard of how to live for God.
[time=1652] The standard of what it looks like when you're fully devoted and you're following God with all your heart, these are the things you give yourself to.
[time=1658] These are the ways that you pursue.
[time=1662] But now in chapter 7 verse 1, he circles back.
[time=1666] And he says in verse 1, "Do not judge lest you be judged."
[time=1672] And I believe with all my heart that what he is saying is this, now that I've laid the standard out for you very clear.
[time=1678] Here's something I'm going to promise you, every single one of you is going to fail to meet it every single day of your life.
[time=1688] Praise God, we've got a standard. Praise God, we've got guidance.
[time=1691] Praise God, we've got a direction and a roadmap for life, and we know how to view these various significant issues in our life.
[time=1697] But he comes in chapter 7, he says, "Don't fool yourself, every single one of us is going to fail to meet it every day of our lives."
[time=1705] And the big issue is how are we going to treat each other when we fail to meet the standard?
[time=1711] How are we going to choose to treat each other and interact one with another when we consistently and regularly fail to meet the divine standard,
[time=1721] which he has so graciously given to us in chapters 5 and 6?
[time=1726] And there are only two choices. There are only two responses and every single one of us falls into either category at all times.
[time=1736] We can either become judgmental. We can become critical. We can become divisive.
[time=1743] And we can get a finger going at everybody we know who doesn't meet the standard with a condemning vindictive attitude that's called judging.
[time=1754] Or we can help each other struggle along the way and try to do the best we can.
[time=1760] I mean, given we're all going to fail every day anyway, what's the point of judging one another?
[time=1765] Why not just admit that we're all a bunch of sinners and we're all going to fail every day and then use the energy that might have been misgiven to judging to helping and restoring and loving and caring and helping one another?
[time=1780] And that is the passion that is in his heart.
[time=1784] As he changes the whole direction of his sermon in chapter 7 verse 1, "Do not judge lest you be judged."
[time=1794] When you think about it, having a standard as it's laid out in 5 and 6, it gives us hope.
[time=1800] And it's a great thing to know that we are not caught on this wild raging sea of no morality in the 90s of American culture.
[time=1811] It is so great to know that the Lord has communicated and compassionate and relevant and clear and colorful and authoritative tones the reality that there is a standard and it comes from God and you can bank on this one.
[time=1824] You can live this way. But it's also incredibly wonderful of God to communicate the notion that we are going to fail to meet it on a regular basis.
[time=1835] Every single one of us will fail this standard. Every single one of us today is failing this standard.
[time=1840] We are sinning against it in one form or another. It is just foolishness to assume or think of ourselves in any other light than failing to meet this.
[time=1851] And so the great issue which he begins to discuss is how should we treat each other?
[time=1855] Would you judge yourselves? Would you become unmerciful, unforgiving, unkind, critical, condemning, fault-finding, sensorious people?
[time=1863] Who get your greatest joy and your greatest rush and your greatest conversations about what the other person did wrong and how the other person failed to live to the standard?
[time=1873] Or would you instead, along the way, one fellow is struggling to another, wrap your arm around that person and say let's try harder again to live like God wants us to live.
[time=1886] I'll try again if you'll try again. I'll give it a shot if you'll give it a shot.
[time=1895] Well, he pretty much rules out the first option. You can see it right there in verse 1. Do not judge. Do not judge.
[time=1905] Now, I want to be careful to point out that God is not asking you to suspend all your critical judgment capacities.
[time=1913] He is not asking you to stop evaluating behavior as if there were no right or no wrong.
[time=1919] The Bible calls you and it calls me to know the difference between right and wrong, to recognize it, to name it, and then to explain it to our kids,
[time=1929] and then to be careful about the company we keep so as not to let the bad company of others corrupt good morals.
[time=1938] The Word of God is not inviting you to some type of spineless reality where there is neither right nor wrong and whatever you do is good for you, that is not what this passage is calling for.
[time=1947] We are to know right and wrong, to name right and wrong, to teach right and wrong, and to be careful the company we keep in the process and the influence that company may have on us.
[time=1957] The Bible is also not calling you to suspend your good judgment in terms of doctrine and truth.
[time=1963] There is a thing called heresy. There is a thing called false teaching, and there are people that you'll meet in the rest of chapter 7 of this very sermon who are called false prophets.
[time=1974] And we are to know who they are, and we are to recognize them, and we are to name them, and we are to expose them and their false teaching.
[time=1981] In Romans 16, verse 17, the Word of God says, "Mark them that cause division and offenses contrary to the doctrine which we have learned and avoid them."
[time=1991] There is my friends, a ten-amount commitment and call to truth and to obedience and to right and wrong.
[time=1999] And this passage does in no way mitigate against that ferocious appetite that we should have for the truth, both in our doctrine and in our lifestyle.
[time=2009] I would be remiss not to add that in our relationships, our one-on-one relationships, this passage is not saying you stop talking to your brother or sister about what they might have done wrong.
[time=2020] Either to you or to somebody else. This is not a passage that puts off limits genuine real conversation about sin and faults and failures and selfishness and indecisions and all the kinds of things that can corrupt relationships.
[time=2035] The Bible says, "Faithful are the wounds of a friend," and what it means there is that you are to allow people to become so good friends and so close in your life.
[time=2045] They know your script, they know your agenda before you do, and they can come to you with love and compassion and tears in their eyes and say, "Is this really who you want to be?
[time=2054] Is this really the direction you want ahead? Is this really the way you want to treat that person? Is this really how you want to treat me?"
[time=2062] And the reason it's such a powerful wound is because the person is such a close friend, they know you so well.
[time=2069] And this in no way puts out of bounds or off limits the kind of open, vulnerable communication that makes Christianity what it is.
[time=2079] It's a group of redeemed sinners who instead of judging one another come alongside to help, but sometimes the helping is confrontational and sometimes it even hurts.
[time=2088] You say, "What is judging?" Judging is primarily a condemning attitude.
[time=2094] You judge someone when you condemn them in your heart and your mind with a condemning attitude.
[time=2100] It's that critical fault-finding spirit that void of any compassion, understanding, or empathy sits as judge and jury on another person's actions, thoughts, or motives.
[time=2124] These are the negative moments in our lives. These are the critical moments in our lives. These are the ugly moments in our lives.
[time=2131] When we look at people and we see what they do and we begin to talk to ourselves and other people about what's wrong with them.
[time=2139] Did you see what he or she did? Did you see what he or she didn't do? And then we begin to assign motives to their behavior.
[time=2147] And we write a script in our mind, the evil that would have been going on in their heart.
[time=2153] We begin to answer the question, "Why? Do you know why she said that? Do you know why she wore that? Do you know why she went there? Would you like to know why she won't go there?"
[time=2163] And we begin to be very, very ugly and judgmental in our hearts.
[time=2173] You and I are judgmental. When we take a standard, when we take a standard of behavior, how we think we should be treated or how we think a person should have acted in any given situation.
[time=2184] You and I are judgmental when we take that standard and we lay it up against their behavior.
[time=2189] And when that standard is violated or not met, then we mercilessly condemn, criticize, and impune the violator.
[time=2197] Instead of having mercy, compassion, forgiveness, and understanding.
[time=2205] And what the Lord is calling us to do here is first of all to have the right standard.
[time=2210] That's why I think he spent so much time in chapters 5 and 6 on, "Well, what is the standard?"
[time=2216] Because the scribes and the Pharisees, and this is another point of great connection I find in my heart and life with the scribes and the Pharisees,
[time=2223] is they were prone to changing the true standard of God.
[time=2227] They would take a little bit away from the standard of God, they would add a little bit more to the standard of God, they would personalize the standard,
[time=2235] and then they would begin to hold other people accountable to live their own personalized standard.
[time=2241] I can look at another person and how they dress, and the Bible says nothing about how you're supposed to dress other than that you're supposed to be modest.
[time=2248] And I can begin to fill in the blanks under modest with my own personalized standard, and when somebody else doesn't dress according to my standard, I can judge them for that.
[time=2258] I can watch what another person does with their money, what another person does with their child, what another person does with where they live, what another person does with their free time.
[time=2266] And I can begin to compare all that behavior against my standard, the unbiblical part and the biblical part.
[time=2273] And I dare say that all of us have a combination of each running around in our value systems.
[time=2279] A lot of us have a lot of biblical values, and a lot of us have some extra values that we call biblical.
[time=2285] And we pick those up along the way, we see it in various situations, some of it we pick up in our past, and so we've got this amalgamated standard,
[time=2293] and some of it's truly biblical, and some of it's very personalized, and you judge and I judge when I begin to hold my standard up to examine all your behavior by.
[time=2301] And the first thing Jesus is saying is you might want to take a really good, long look at your standard.
[time=2307] And one of the great adventures of studying the Word of God and trying to learn as much as you can about the truth of God
[time=2313] is the whole values reassessment issue where you begin to strip away from your standard of how people should act and behave things which are not in the Bible.
[time=2323] And you get that out of your system as best you can, and then you begin to learn other things that are the standard
[time=2329] and you gently build those in.
[time=2332] And Jesus says, first of all, it's important to have the right standard.
[time=2338] And that's chapters five and six, and then He says to us, when people fail to meet that standard,
[time=2346] whether it's a purely biblical standard or whether it's one of those that's a little bit black and a little bit white as you've mixed your own formula,
[time=2354] and I dare say none of us will ever have the perfect standard.
[time=2357] When people fail to meet your personal standard, do not judge them.
[time=2363] Help them.
[time=2365] Care for them.
[time=2366] Love them.
[time=2367] Forgive them.
[time=2369] That's so refreshing in it.
[time=2375] One of the things I love most about church is communion.
[time=2378] The thing I think I love more about church than anything else is communion.
[time=2382] Because of what it tells me about how my God loves me.
[time=2387] He saves me through His death on the cross.
[time=2390] And then He invites me to go public with that in baptism, the first sacrament that He gave to the church.
[time=2395] And for some strange reason, it's okay with Him for me to stand up publicly and say that I belong to Him.
[time=2399] You know, He's not embarrassed by that. I think that's amazing in and of itself.
[time=2403] But then He gives us a second sacrament called communion.
[time=2406] And communion is the sacrament which evidences His anticipation of my continued sin even after I've come to Christ.
[time=2414] Even after I've repented for the zillionth time of the same sin.
[time=2417] He in communion says to me, and we do what happens to do it once a month here.
[time=2420] We could do it once a week or once a year.
[time=2422] There's no prescribed number of times, but we do it once a month.
[time=2424] And so on a monthly basis, my Lord says to me, Russell, you come back here to this thing, and I instituted this in the Lord's Supper because I knew you'd need this.
[time=2433] I knew you'd need to come back and review your life as a corporate body with other believers in the same process at the same time saying this is the degree to which I have fallen short, the standard once again. Please forgive me.
[time=2446] And in communion is not only the call to examine my life, but the promise of His continued provision and forgiveness to forgive and forgive and forgive and forgive and forgive.
[time=2456] And that's what we do as an organized church when we call communion.
[time=2459] That's what communion is about. You know what this passage is?
[time=2462] This is communion in an unorganized way.
[time=2465] This is communion hitting the streets of Christianity.
[time=2469] This is the very call of God in communion to you and to me apart from the sacrament itself
[time=2475] and apart from the organization of the church as we interface in our daily lives in relationship with spouse and children and friends not to judge but to continue to extend forgiveness.
[time=2486] Continue to give grace. You and I are never to get up in the judge's seat with a brother or a sister.
[time=2494] We don't belong there. It's not for us.
[time=2501] So if we're trying to organize this passage that what I've just said might come under the heading of the command and the command is do not judge.
[time=2510] Now he opens this thinking a little more to us and he says let me give you one of the consequences of judging.
[time=2515] Second point here this morning might be the consequence of judging.
[time=2519] Look at it in verse 1.
[time=2521] Do not judge lest you be judged.
[time=2523] For in the way you judge you will be judged and by your standard of measure it will be measured to you.
[time=2532] Not at all totally what to make of these two verses but there are some who say that this is God saying
[time=2538] that if you are judgmental of other people that he will be judgmental of you.
[time=2542] It seems to imply that there's something about the way that I would treat another person which would impact the way that he would treat me.
[time=2549] But I don't much think that's what this means.
[time=2553] I tend to believe that God's standard of judgment on my life is an absolute.
[time=2558] I believe he knows the standard. I believe he is unaffected by my behavior in his standard.
[time=2562] I believe that and I'm quite thankful that nothing I am going to do is going to alter him one way or the other.
[time=2567] He is a righteous holy impartial judge and he is going to judge an absolute perfection every single case that was ever given to him.
[time=2574] Nothing you do or I will do is going to ever influence the standard by which he judges us.
[time=2579] So I kind of rule out that first notion.
[time=2581] Here's what I think this means.
[time=2583] I think this is just very down to earth common sense stuff.
[time=2586] When you are with a group of people and you become judgmental of somebody in that group.
[time=2594] You release a poison or a toxin or as the word of God would call it 11 into that group of people.
[time=2602] You begin to create an atmosphere and an attitude that becomes judgmental.
[time=2608] And as you begin to make your wrong judgments and assessments of another person,
[time=2614] and as you begin to give evidence of those and talk about those and treat people in light of your judgments, you begin to infect your group of people with that judgmental attitude.
[time=2623] And eventually that very attitude which you started is going to become pervasive in the group and then you're going to run head on back into the same attitude you created.
[time=2632] Because you're going to sin, you're going to make a mistake, you're going to fail to meet the standard.
[time=2637] And the way they're going to treat you is exactly the way you treated them.
[time=2641] I think that's basically what this means.
[time=2644] Do not breed a judgmental spirit.
[time=2647] A little 11, 11 is the whole lump. And it will spread from you to the person you judge to the next person to the next person
[time=2653] and that eventually there's an attitude that becomes characteristic.
[time=2656] And then there's an atmosphere of judgment that sits upon you and your group.
[time=2660] It could be your family, it could be your friends, it could be where you work.
[time=2663] Some of you can think of your work environments and you can identify the very leaders of the judgmental attitude there.
[time=2669] And there are people in your workplace who are scared to death of making a mistake for fear that they will be judged.
[time=2676] That they will be the objects of character assassination.
[time=2681] And the Lord says don't let that happen to your groups.
[time=2685] Don't let that happen to your family. Don't let that happen to your groups.
[time=2689] Instead, allow the refreshing breeze of forgiveness and empathy and compassion and understanding blow through your family
[time=2698] and blow through your group.
[time=2700] And when somebody falls down and when somebody fails to meet the standard, where there might have been a condemning harsh spirit,
[time=2710] you show them forgiveness, you show them compassion, you show them empathy because you know it could have been you.
[time=2719] You know it will be you next time.
[time=2723] So the command don't judge. One of the consequences of a judgmental spirit is you can infect your entire group,
[time=2732] your entire sphere of influence and you will get the same treatment in return.
[time=2737] And together as a group you will languish in the hot desert sun of judgment.
[time=2745] You say well okay, you're talking about me.
[time=2750] This is my family and I'm an instigator. This is my group and I'm an instigator.
[time=2754] And I know I'm part of this. Could you mind helping me now with how not to be this way?
[time=2759] And the Lord immediately shifts the focus to the cure.
[time=2763] The command, the consequence and the cure.
[time=2766] The cure for judging versus three, four and five.
[time=2770] And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye and do not notice the log that is in your own eye?
[time=2776] Or how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye and behold the log is in your own eye?
[time=2782] He says you hypocrite. Now I don't think he's saying that with a lot of energy and a lot of venom.
[time=2786] I don't think he's saying you hypocrites. I think he's saying you hypocrites.
[time=2790] Here's what you do. Look at verse five again. First take out the log of your own eye.
[time=2796] And then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
[time=2802] Now this word first in verse five. It means priority. It means in order of sequence.
[time=2808] This implies a tremendous commitment to obedience. You realize that don't you?
[time=2812] The Lord is not throwing caution to the wind. He is not trying to introduce some immorality that becomes pervasive in the church. He is saying there is a commitment to holiness.
[time=2820] There is a commitment to what is right and to living right. But the commitment starts with yourself.
[time=2826] Be mindful of your own sin. Look harder at your sin first.
[time=2832] Refuse the temptation to establish a double standard under which you look harder at another person's sin
[time=2838] than you do your own. And man I can do that so quickly. Can't you look at another person's violation
[time=2846] and sin with a much more critical eye than you do your own?
[time=2852] I can become exercised and passionate over the sins of another person while minimizing my own sin which might have been greater. I can point an accusing finger at another person and never turn
[time=2862] that same finger back on myself. And it can be my spouse, my children, my friends, a boss or an
[time=2870] employer, a co-worker. And the Lord is saying hey wait a minute don't act like foolish
[time=2876] self-righteous people. Don't become a self-righteous fool thinking that they are the only ones with problems.
[time=2884] He says the cure for judging other people is to take an honest, true, genuine, sincere look at your own sin
[time=2894] which takes us right back to the first of the Beatitudes blessed are the poor in spirit and those who mourn.
[time=2900] And I don't know how much to do that either. I guess you just beg God. I guess you just say God.
[time=2905] I'm feeling somehow not as sinful as would be healthy here.
[time=2910] I'm beginning to have an extra sensitivity to everybody else's sin and very little to my own.
[time=2915] That enough causes me father to ask you to come and convict again and bring a fresh sense of my own violations
[time=2922] and not so that I become this wobbling heap of misery over my own sin and I can't live my life
[time=2928] but just a sound profound healthy conviction of how I heard other people's feelings
[time=2934] of how I violate you. You just beg God to come and do His examining work in your life and to produce the attitude that is there of a poor and a broken spirit.
[time=2945] So it says first, first look at yourself.
[time=2950] But I like the fact that it says then, verse 5, you hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye
[time=2956] and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.
[time=2960] Let me tell you something, Christianity is not okay. I'll go over here and fix my sin and you go over there and fix your sin and when I'm fixed and you're fixed, we'll have a great time right here in the middle. That is not what it's about.
[time=2972] What it's about is we're both right here in the middle all the time. That's what Christianity is.
[time=2975] It's called being in relationship with other believers and we're in community, one with another.
[time=2978] And in the midst of doing that, I get this huge thing in my eye.
[time=2983] And I can see it clearly for what it is because it's my sin.
[time=2987] I know those are my motives and I know those are my thoughts.
[time=2989] You only got a speck because I don't know what your real motives were.
[time=2991] But I know what mine are and they're huge.
[time=2994] And right in the middle of being in community, I'll be working on taking mine out.
[time=2998] And as I'm working on taking mine out, you're a little bit ahead.
[time=3000] And so you come over and you put your shoulder around me and say, man, I've struggled with that too.
[time=3004] That's what this feels like and I go, that's exactly what it feels like.
[time=3007] You have struggled with my sin. What did you do? Well, I helped if I did this and this.
[time=3012] Well, did it work? Well, kind of, for a little while.
[time=3016] Well, are you still fighting that same sin? Yeah, I am.
[time=3019] You're going to keep fighting it? Yeah, I am.
[time=3021] Will you help me fight my, yeah, I will. Oh, great.
[time=3025] So in other words, get this thing out of your eye so you can go carefully and tenderly over to another person and help them with that little thing that they're dealing with, but not with a sensorious critical condemning attitude.
[time=3036] It's so exciting.
[time=3040] I remember when I got my, we moved into our first house here in Fort Wayne, Indiana about, I guess, four years ago now.
[time=3046] And I was renovating the bathroom. Some of you are here then and you know the story.
[time=3050] I was working with a saw, an electric saw and some plywood and I was peeking around the corner without safety glasses.
[time=3057] Smart pastor, you know.
[time=3059] And I get the splinter in my eye, the speck, couldn't see it.
[time=3063] And I'll tell you, I went straight to the doctor.
[time=3067] The doctor had two good eyes. The doctor had sterilized equipment.
[time=3070] The doctor had a big magnifying glass. The doctor had extra light to put on in there.
[time=3074] And he had just the right tool and he had incredible knowledge and he got that thing out.
[time=3079] The Lord says that's got to be the dynamic going on inside, inside of Christianity.
[time=3083] There's got to be a constant moving from one person's life to another person's knife as failure and as sin occur.
[time=3088] And we hold each other up and we pull those things out of each other's eyes because there's a heart of true humility and true confession and an awareness of our own sin.
[time=3097] And that allows us to really help.
[time=3101] So the Lord backs up and he says, let me tell you how you ought to live.
[time=3105] Let me tell you how to view yourself. Let me tell you how to view other people.
[time=3108] Let me tell you how to view me. Let me tell you how you ought to view things.
[time=3112] Now that I've got that standard clarified, let me say something really important.
[time=3115] Don't miss this. You're never going to live it.
[time=3118] That's because you're saved by grace.
[time=3121] And you've only got two choices as to how you're going to treat each other when you start messing up on the true standard.
[time=3126] You're either going to judge each other and become critical and divisive and tear relationships apart or you're going to be compassionate and forgiving and understanding as you bear the weight of your own sin and seek the help of others and struggle together.
[time=3141] And he says, please avoid the consequence of a judgmental community.
[time=3146] You don't want to live in one of those. Let that go.
[time=3151] In the time remains, let me just give you a couple of practical suggestions that come right out of my own failure.
[time=3157] Number one, I want to say this to you. When you feel yourself too judgmental, a lot of times it probably has to do with the fact that you have not gotten in the other person's shoes.
[time=3166] A lot of times when you feel yourself too judgmental, it is because you have not sufficiently taken the time to get in their shoes
[time=3173] and try to understand their life from their perspective.
[time=3177] Last week, the news of this bomb and this big crash and these people dead in the bottom of the ocean and the effort to try to determine what caused the crash and get the wreckage up and get the victims out.
[time=3189] We got word that I was on vacation so I didn't have regular access to news, but we got word that there were some of the victims' family members who were very critical of the officials
[time=3201] for not getting those bodies up quicker.
[time=3204] And my instant reaction was, well, those family members are just being jerks.
[time=3209] And I was beginning to judge the family members for judging the officials.
[time=3215] And there was the 11, right? All I needed to do was fail to understand, you know what?
[time=3221] I understand that you got to take care and protect that site and get those engines up and figure out if I was a missile or a bomb and try to prevent the next one and all the rest.
[time=3227] But I'll tell you what, if I was one of the family members whose wife or child was laying at the bottom of the ocean, I'd probably be wondering why they haven't gotten them up sooner, too.
[time=3236] But there I found myself judging them for judging them.
[time=3240] And the solution isn't in the judging.
[time=3242] The solution is trying to get in their shoes and say, yeah, I understand that.
[time=3246] Probably not the wisest thing they've ever said, but they sure understand what they're feeling.
[time=3250] I could sure feel those feelings with them.
[time=3253] I would sure want my loved one up sooner.
[time=3256] I don't know who it is in your life that you feel judgmental towards.
[time=3259] I don't know who it is, you've got the finger out and you've got them pegged and you've got them wired.
[time=3265] You can describe in paragraphs why they're such horrible people.
[time=3269] I just wonder, have you gotten in their shoes recently?
[time=3273] Have you let the defenses down and have you moved over there and strapped those tinnies on and said, let me take a look at your life from your perspective as best I can.
[time=3281] And have you even gone a step further and said, I'm having trouble seeing it from your vantage.
[time=3285] Could you tell me?
[time=3286] I'll buy the coffee. You talk.
[time=3289] No judgment. Let me just listen.
[time=3294] The second thing that I have found about myself, when I am most judgmental, it is because I am personally threatened by that other person.
[time=3301] The times I become most judgmental towards another person are the times when I am most personally threatened by them.
[time=3307] They may have a strength where I have a weakness.
[time=3310] They may be moving into my turf. They may be taking over something.
[time=3313] They may be this. They may be that. But the point of it is it comes back at a personal level where I feel threatened by who and what they are and what they're doing.
[time=3321] Those are the people I can become instantaneously and ferociously judgmental of.
[time=3327] Merciless in my judgments on them.
[time=3332] And so if you have some people like that in your life, you might want to back down a step or two below the actual judgmental attitude and say, now what is it about them that so threatens me?
[time=3342] Then how is it that the Lord would want me to materially respond in this particular situation?
[time=3347] And so we don't just look at the symptom, which is the judgmental attitude.
[time=3351] We try to look a little bit at the cause, that feeling of being personal threatened.
[time=3355] My last little bit of advice, which I learned more by observation than practice, is to try to think the best of other people.
[time=3362] Just try to develop the natural response to any situation to put the best possible spin on what they did
[time=3370] and why they did it as you legitimately can.
[time=3373] You always be defending them until otherwise it's proven.
[time=3377] You always be assuming the very best of them until the obvious is the opposite of what you've been saying.
[time=3384] You go down fighting with the ship saying it wasn't that.
[time=3388] They were thinking this, they meant this, they wanted to be this way and they just weren't.
[time=3393] Instead of jumping so quickly to the other extreme.
[time=3396] And so I encourage you to talk about their strengths.
[time=3399] I encourage you to talk about their growth, the growth that you've seen in their life.
[time=3403] I encourage you to be truly amazed at the accomplishments that they have covered in their life.
[time=3409] To be free to express gratitude for what they have done, for you and for others.
[time=3414] Quite simply to begin to think the very best of them.
[time=3418] One man put it this way.
[time=3421] No man knows the strength of another man's temptation.
[time=3425] It's good sentence.
[time=3426] No man knows the strength of another man's temptation.
[time=3429] The man with the placid and equitable temperament knows nothing of the temptation of the man whose blood is a fire
[time=3435] and whose passions are on a hair trigger.
[time=3438] The man brought up in a good home and Christian surroundings knows nothing of the temptation of the one brought up in a slum or in a place where evil stocks abroad.
[time=3446] The man blessed with fine parents knows nothing of the temptations of the man who has the load of a bad heredity on his back.
[time=3454] The fact is that if we realized what some people have to go through so far from condemning them,
[time=3460] we would be amazed they have succeeded in being as good as they are.
[time=3466] Now you let that cool gentle breeze of the grace of God begin to flow out of your lips and out of your heart
[time=3472] into the relationships you have and family and friends and you just find a difference that it makes.
[time=3478] People are going to feel better about themselves.
[time=3480] People are going to feel whole.
[time=3482] People are going to want to be with you.
[time=3483] People are going to be encouraged by you.
[time=3485] And people are going to achieve things for the cause of Christ that they would never otherwise achieve

[time=3496] And if that's not enough, we might come back to the cross and look into the face of the one who was nailed there,
[time=3502] misunderstood, maligned, spittle running off his body from men who didn't deserve a breath and remember the horror

[time=3513] They judged the blameless one and then killed him.
[time=3518] So let's stop judging.
