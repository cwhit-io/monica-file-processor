[time=30] This is the Sunday Morning Worship Service of Black Hawk Baptist Church.
[time=52] Thank you for joining us.
[time=54] Today Pastor Moore continues his series on the Sermon on the Mount with the message he is entitled "God's Wisdom Works." His text is taken from Matthew chapter 7 verses 24 through 29.
[time=65] Stay with us today as he shares with us from God's Word.
[time=68] Now let's join our service.
[time=70] Sometimes my little heart can understand what's in your will, what's in your plan.
[time=84] So many times I'm tempted to ask you why.
[time=98] But I can never forget it for long, Lord what you do, could not be wrong.
[time=107] So I'll believe you even when I must cry.
[time=117] Do I trust you, Lord, does the river flow, do I trust you, Lord, does the north wind
[time=128] flow.
[time=129] You can see my heart, you can read my mind, and you've got to know I would rather die
[time=140] than to lose my faith, in no one I love, do I trust you, Lord, do I trust you.
[time=156] I know the answers I've given them all, but suddenly now I feel so small, shaken down
[time=176] to the cavity in my soul.
[time=186] I know the doctrine and theology, but right now they don't mean much to me.
[time=197] This time there's only one thing I've got to know.
[time=207] Do I trust you, Lord, does the robin sing, do I trust you, Lord, does it rain in spring.
[time=219] You can see my heart, you can read my mind, and you've got to know I would rather die
[time=230] than to lose my faith, in no one I love, do I trust you, Lord, do I trust you.
[time=245] I will trust you, Lord, when I don't know why I will trust you, Lord, till the day I die,
[time=267] I will trust you, Lord, when I blind with pain, you were God before, and you'll never change,
[time=278] I will trust you, I will trust you, Lord.
[time=289] I will trust you, Lord, I will trust you, Lord, I will trust you, Lord.
[time=319] I can trust and choose your will for me, or I can choose to trust my own,
[time=330] but every time I do, I end up in the news, longing for your arms to lift me up.
[time=345] I can take the road and leave me down, or I can turn and go my way, but every time I do,
[time=356] I end up on my knees, longing for your arms to lift me up.
[time=368] I know you know just what I need, I know you have a plan for me, so I'm gonna take your lead,
[time=381] and I won't worry what the future holds, because I know you know.
[time=399] I can hear just what you have to say, or I can hear just what I want,
[time=408] but every time I do, I end up on my knees, longing for your arms to lift me up.
[time=423] I know you know just what I need, I know you have a plan for me, so I'm gonna take your lead,
[time=436] and I won't worry what the future holds, because I know you know.
[time=446] Lord, your faithful in everything, everything, you're the right I'm leaning on.
[time=477] No, and I won't worry what the future holds.
[time=484] I know you know just what I need, I know you have a plan for me, so I'm gonna take your lead,
[time=501] and I won't worry what the future holds, because I know you know.
[time=517] Ooo, I know you know, Ooo, I know you know, Ooo, I know you know.
[time=547] Well, let me invite you to take your Bible, and let's go to Matthew chapter 7 for our
[time=557] last time studying the Sermon on the Mount.
[time=561] Matthew chapter 7, we'll just look at the closing verses of our Lord's remarks in the
[time=567] Sermon on the Mount.
[time=569] When I was a young boy just turning, going into the fourth grade, my family moved from
[time=575] Los Angeles to about two hours north, an inland valley called the Santinas Valley, you may
[time=581] know of it or have heard of it.
[time=583] It's where President Reagan's ranch is, I guess he's selling that now, and other celebrities live there now.
[time=588] When I moved there, none of those people lived there, it was just a place where you went.
[time=592] Most folks to raise Arabian horse ranches.
[time=595] The Santinas Valley was full of multi-million dollar Arabian horse ranches, and my family wasn't there for that purpose, but they were everywhere.
[time=604] Picture in your mind, if you will, sprawling ranch houses and beautiful barns and racetracks upon which to run these horses, and then the horses themselves, absolutely gorgeous specimens
[time=615] of God's creation.
[time=617] We hadn't been there, but about 18 months when it began to rain, and rain, and rain, and rain, and rain, and rain, and they called it the worst rain they'd had in 30 years.
[time=627] It just seemed to never stop until finally a dam about 25 miles north broke, and it brought
[time=635] a crushing wall of water down through the Santinas River.
[time=640] And I'll never forget getting up that morning and driving with my parents to the edge of this river and seeing where once these expensive Arabian horse ranches now, it was just water.
[time=651] I mean, it was just water, half a mile wide, just water just raging down through this river bed.
[time=656] I was even, I think, aware before the storm that it was a river bed.
[time=660] I just thought it was a bunch of ranches on ground that was slightly lower than the rest of the place.
[time=665] Cars were floating down the river bed, houses were floating down the river bed, barns were floating down the river bed, cattle were floating down the river bed, horses were floating down.
[time=675] Everything in its path was destroyed and devastated.
[time=678] Some of the horses had been able to find their way to slightly higher ground in the middle of the river bed and were being lifted out by helicopter, they were so expensive and valuable.
[time=687] A sharp contrast was drawn in my mind at that early age between the people who built their ranches down in the river bed and theirs were now gone and destroyed and devastated, and
[time=698] the other people who built their ranches outside the floodplain.
[time=703] And I began to ask myself, why would somebody do that?
[time=707] I mean, why would somebody take their life savings all they had and invest it in a gorgeous ranch but build it or have it right in the middle of a floodplain or a river bed?
[time=719] Pretty foolish thing to do.
[time=722] Failure to look ahead, failure to look ahead can lead even smart people to make some pretty
[time=728] devastating choices.
[time=730] It happens not just where you build your house, some people do it with retirement.
[time=734] I know people who have lived very full luxurious lives, where they wanted to go, they spent
[time=740] the money they wanted to spend, they ate where they wanted to eat, they lived in the kind of house they wanted to live in, they took the expensive vacations, they wore the expensive clothes, et cetera, et cetera, and all the while they were not preparing for their retirement.
[time=752] And now they're 60, 65 years of age and because they haven't made preparation, because they kind of lived all for the immediate, the now, and weren't looking down the road, their center of living has had to significantly drop, it's very hard on them, it was a very foolish thing for them to do.
[time=769] People do that with their health, they fail to lift up their eyes and look down the road a little bit and while they're young enough in their 20s and 30s and 40s, they don't exercise and they don't eat right and they don't manage stress levels properly and they think it's all going to be okay and somehow they'll be immune to the things that normally happen to people that do those kinds of things but inevitably they end up having heart attacks and other kinds of physical problems because they didn't have a long term view.
[time=795] They didn't anticipate the future.
[time=798] People I know do that with their marriage.
[time=801] For years and years and years and years and years, just living selfishly and taking and taking and refusing to give and refusing to change and refusing to love and refusing to pursue and no growth and no change in them personally and they begin to wear that spouse out and over time finally it takes its toll and now they're standing on the edge of divorce.
[time=823] Foolish behavior just to live in the here and now and what Jesus does at the end of His
[time=829] sermon is He says this, "It's one thing to be foolish about where you might build your house or retirement needs or health needs or marriage needs but don't be foolish with your eternity.
[time=840] Don't fail to look at your current circumstances and say, "Well, everything seems to be going all right now.
[time=845] I guess it'll go all right forever." He says there's a storm brewing out there and it's coming your way and you best be ready
[time=854] for it.
[time=857] Look at Matthew chapter 7 verse 24, "Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and
[time=863] acts upon them may be compared to a wise man who built his house upon the rock and the
[time=869] rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and burst against that house and yet it did not fall for it had been founded upon the rock.
[time=880] And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act upon them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and burst against that house and it fell and great was its fall."
[time=897] Jesus has a picture in His mind of two men building basically identical homes.
[time=902] The one man thinks little about the warnings, thinks little about the future, thinks little about what might come in the days that follow this particular day and so he is comfortable
[time=912] to build his house upon the sand.
[time=916] The Lord calls him a fool.
[time=918] The other man in his mind is a man who thinks much about the future, who anticipates the difficulties of changing weather and therefore refuses to expediently get something up in
[time=929] a hurry but in other apparel account the Lord says he dug deep and built his house upon
[time=935] the rock and the Lord calls that man wise.
[time=940] In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus is doing battle for the souls of the common men who have assembled to hear him speak, the commoner, the common man, the common woman.
[time=951] His ministry has been irresistible, multitudes follow him everywhere he goes and every time he stops they all bump into each other and form a mini congregation and in this particular occasion there is a great horde of people that have gathered on this mountainside outside
[time=964] of Galilee and he is addressing the issue of preparedness for heaven, the long-term
[time=970] view of being ready to enter into the kingdom of God.
[time=974] The scribes and the Pharisees are part of this great group of people, they really break into two groups, the scribes and the Pharisees and then everybody else and the Lord I wonder if he didn't already know that he would eventually lose the scribes and the Pharisees to the hardness of their own hearts.
[time=989] They were fully entrenched in their self-righteousness, they had given much and sacrificed greatly to try to lift themselves up as the paragon of religious righteousness and no one, not
[time=1000] even Jesus Christ himself and all the miracles and all the teaching was going to be able to unearth their hard hearts.
[time=1007] They were going to go to their grave believing that they were sufficient and righteous in and of themselves in the religious system that they had developed.
[time=1017] Since this is our last time in the Sermon on the Mount I'll let you know what happens with the scribes and the Pharisees by about chapter 23 and you don't need to turn there, but by about chapter 23 the Lord has had enough of these guys, the Lord is nearing the end
[time=1029] of the last week of his ministry, he has given them miracle after miracle, he has met with them privately, he has met with them publicly, he has said everything he knows how to say and all they have done with the increase of evidence and revelation on his part that he is the Son of God and they need to repent, the higher that information came where the greater volume of that so was their rejection of him.
[time=1049] They counseled to kill him over and over and over again, they worked plots against him and eventually the final plot they had was for his crucifixion.
[time=1058] But just before all of that occurred, listen to what he says to them, "Woe to you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites." Now the word woe, what that means is damn and it doesn't mean damn like I met at you, it means damn you as in the final pronunciation of your eternal destiny, let me read it again,
[time=1075] but damn you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from men, for you do not enter in yourselves and nor do you allow those who are entering to go in also.
[time=1087] And I dare say he has in his mind the imagery of at least this occasion, the Sermon on the Mount as he pronounces that great and final judgment upon these false religious leaders and he is saying you are going to go to hell not only because you didn't enter the kingdom of heaven but because you shut it off from other men who would follow you, who would be persuaded by you to think about the kingdom of heaven as you taught them to think about the kingdom of heaven.
[time=1113] He curses them seven times in this one particular chapter.
[time=1116] He says damn you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you travel about on sea and land to make one proselyte and when he becomes one you make him twice as much the son of hell as yourself not only were they leading people in the homeland of Jerusalem to hell they would travel abroad and they would get converts and those people would be in danger rather not in danger but if they bought into their religious system on their way to hell, signs sealed and delivered.
[time=1141] Woe to you scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites because you devour widows houses even while for a pretense you make long prayers therefore you shall receive greater condemnation.
[time=1150] You appear religious you travel from house to house you visit the widows and all you're doing is having a pretense of religion you pray over them but what you want is their money you're devouring their households through your religious system and you're going to hell for it.
[time=1164] Woe to you blind guy to say whoever swears by the temple and that is nothing but whoever swears by the goal of the temple he is obligated.
[time=1172] Again a rehearsing of their manipulation of the truth of God to their own ends.
[time=1179] Some use scribes and Pharisees you hypocrites for you tithe, mitt and dill and cumin and have neglected the weight of your provisions of the law, justice and mercy and faithfulness you're all about legalism you're all about ritual you're all about keeping the law but there is nothing in you of justice and mercy and faithfulness on and on he goes.
[time=1200] That part of the crowd is hopelessly lost and they will not come to him that they might be saved.
[time=1206] But there's a second group in the crowd the common man and that common man has been led astray by the scribes and the Pharisees as our Lord noted in Matthew 23 and it's they who he seeks to save it is this group of people the Lord is hoping that he can wrench them
[time=1222] out of the grasp the false religious grasp of these scribes and Pharisees and lead them
[time=1228] to life and so much about what they learned was right they had the right God they had the right tradition in terms of Israel and its history they had the right source of information the Old Testament they had the right understanding of heaven and hell I mean so much was right but the scribes and the Pharisees had perverted that religious system just enough that it was damning them not only the scribes and the Pharisees but this crowd at large buying into that religious system and on their way to hell a man centered religion of works righteousness
[time=1258] and the whole beginning of the Sermon on the Mount chapters five and six and most of seven is the Lord's attempt to lovingly unmask that system of false righteousness and he does it
[time=1268] by saying your righteousness must surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees or you'll never inherit the kingdom of God and then he tells them not only must it surpass theirs but it must be perfect like God is perfect and he hopes in this to absolutely decimate any hopes they may have to stand before God on their own merit and be acceptable before him God is the Lord is saying stop thinking that stop hoping that stop preparing for that in that way that is an absolute idiotic effort on your part the standard is the perfection
[time=1296] of God and so as he begins to wrap his sermon up in the section we're in now it begins back in chapter in verse 13 with this invitation enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide
[time=1307] and the way is broad that leads to destruction and he describes in that broad gate and that broad way the way of religion any kind of human religion any kind of human achievement any kind of statement that organizes people in the effort to try to attain the righteousness to enter heaven apart from the person of Christ and he warns them there he says don't do that
[time=1327] beware of it come instead through the narrow gate and the narrow way which leads to life
[time=1333] and if you were here that particular Sunday you remember that the narrow way and the narrow gate are Christ himself I am the way the truth and the life and no man comes into the Father
[time=1342] but by me and having called them to enter in the narrow gate and stay on the narrow path
[time=1349] that leads to life the next thing he does as he ends the sermon is he cautions them against false prophets described in the Pharisees the very ones who are in their midst as he is giving this sermon and he knows full well the sermon will barely be over and the people finally mingling amongst each other that the false prophets will already be on their way on saying everything that Jesus has just said and they will carefully and subtly manipulative
[time=1376] using Old Testament scriptures by taking them out of context etc etc undermining everything that Jesus said and did and they won't be able to make it back to their homes before they're hit with a barrage and an entourage of attack and then as they go back to their synagogues week after week after week after week describes in the Pharisees will systematically
[time=1396] try to undermine the reality that Christ and Christ alone is the answer to the question of eternal destiny and so he says to them beware of the false prophets which means the word beware hold your mind back and it could be understood he is saying stop doing that stop going to those places don't let those men talk to you don't put your mind under their persuasive cunning deceitful words against the truth that I have just told you
[time=1422] and he gives them reasons and rather points of evaluation to know them judge them by their fruits so that they not only can be warned against false prophets but armed with the ability to assess anyone who says he's a prophet to know whether or not they're true or false
[time=1438] and having done that he moves from the false prophets then in verse 21 he takes up the discussion of the false professors not a teacher but a profession of faith those who make a false
[time=1448] profession of faith beware not only of false prophets but beware yourself of making a false
[time=1454] profession of faith in Christ verse 21 you'll say Lord Lord but you're not going to enter
[time=1460] the kingdom of heaven you'll have done some religious deeds verse 22 you'll prophesy in my name and in my name you'll cast out demons and in my name you may perform miracles it'll be all under the guise of my name under the guise of religion but he says twice depart from me I never knew you and the number one point of evaluation would have been verse
[time=1482] 21 whether or not they did the will of the Father who is in heaven and at the end of verse 23 whether or not they practiced lawlessness two sides of the same coin and Jesus is revealing
[time=1493] here that when a person truly comes to Christ when the Lord Lord is a genuine profession of their heart and their mind and their soul when it becomes the core value of their life something happens to them inside spiritual dominoes begin to fall inside their life such that as they
[time=1508] continue to live their life the will of the Father will be their greatest joy and the aversion of sin will be their greatest commitment and though they will not be perfect they will not live patterns of lawlessness and unrighteousness from the moment they come to Christ until they die there will be a continual growth process that will be evidenced over time that your friends will be able to see and look at and talk about and praise God for in your life so
[time=1532] there's a passage of warning do not go down the broad way through the broad gate it takes you to destruction do not listen to the false prophets who lead you there and say this is
[time=1543] the way of life when in reality it's the way of death and do not suspect in yourself that just because you've given intellectual and mental assent to the Lord Lord thing that you are truly born again wait and see until the transformation comes and base your assurance
[time=1558] that you're truly safe not in a past profession but in a current change of life which gives evidence to the life that God has given you through Christ and so the Lord is working he
[time=1571] is working hard for the souls of men and he is trying to anticipate and think and cut
[time=1577] off all the avenues whereby he might be misunderstood whereby people might choose against the narrow
[time=1583] gate to equip them to make the right decision that determines their eternal destiny and having
[time=1592] done all that he now closes with a very simple but a very profound illustration and what he
[time=1598] is trying to get people to do in this illustration is to anticipate the end of the age he's trying
[time=1604] to get them to mentally see the flood as it rages its way down the city of his valley's river he is trying to get them to see themselves in a hospital having just had a heart attack
[time=1615] twenty years prior to that as they stuff another handful of potato chips in their mouth he
[time=1621] is trying to get these people to see themselves as sixty five year old people now barely able
[time=1627] to eat on social security alone living in an apartment and wondering where all the money
[time=1633] went he is saying please look beyond the present and anticipate the reality of what is coming
[time=1642] it's very difficult for them to do this I want you to know that for these people to make a decision for Christ to enter by the narrow gate was an incredibly costly decision in the here and now everything in their circumstances told them to play it safe every
[time=1657] single person on that mountain had it had a huge reason not to put their faith in Christ and just to stay on the broad road of Judaism because in that broad road of Judaism they had identity they had self-esteem they had family they had culture they had jobs they had a way of life everything for them was bound up in that religious system it's not like it is it was not then like it is now in America where you can have a whole life and
[time=1683] a whole culture and a whole system of friends and a whole deal with nothing religiously or completely diverse religious beliefs and we are the nation of whatever suits you is fine with me do your own thing you do it your way I'll do it mine there is no absolute truth it doesn't matter if we believe differently let's just treat each other nicely these people that lived in a hostile environment to anyone who opposed their viewpoint on the religious
[time=1710] system to this day you have heard of Orthodox Jews who have left Judaism and and their family will shortly hold a funeral service in their honor in their memory and say you
[time=1721] are dead to us they hold an actual funeral service and say you're dead we will talk to you we won't eat with you we won't help you we don't want to know where you are if you go to the hospital it doesn't matter to us if you have kids we don't care you're dead to us why because you have left our Jewish Orthodoxy the people that are sitting on this
[time=1740] mountain are in for a boatload of hurt a world of hurt and history tells us and the
[time=1746] New Testament tells us that many and most of the New Testament Jews who got converted would lose their jobs would be thrown out of their synagogues would lose their family and social status and many of them were destitute and lost and alone which is why when you read in Acts chapter 2 that they were opening their homes and sharing their goods in common with one another the reason that happened in such predominance was because those Jews who just came to Christ had been disenfranchised already they had nothing to go home to they were completely
[time=1775] shut out and ostracized from their community and from their life as they knew it I'll tell you what there's a boatload of reasons in these people's minds why they should stay with Judaism why they should stay on the broad road why they should stay in their current status and keep things smooth as normal and the Lord knows it but he loves him and he can see something
[time=1798] just off the coastline he can see a massive hurricane that's taking shape and it's forming
[time=1805] and it may look like a long way away to the people on planet earth but in his eternal perspective I mean it is right at the door I mean it is now it is the present now the
[time=1816] future now and there's great dividing line between Christ and religion it's going to become he's saying to them sharp and there'll be consequences for your choice and you'll be persecuted for the decision you make many of you will lose your lives and the temptation is just to look at today but don't do that don't be a fool don't do what foolish people
[time=1836] do don't build your house on sand just because right now the sand is dry just because right
[time=1844] now it's easier to build on sand build your house on the rock which will allow you to
[time=1850] sustain the inevitable okay kind of an overview now let me just say two things to you very
[time=1858] clearly this morning out of this text I want you to know that the Lord makes here a in
[time=1865] some ways a veiled illusion to this storm you see it in verse 27 the 25 the rain descended
[time=1873] and the floods came and the winds blew and burst against that house and yet it did not fall that's the storm verse 27 the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and burst against that house that's the picture of judgment we don't have time this morning
[time=1890] but I could I have it underlined in my Bible I could take you through the book of Matthew and I could read to you every reference that the Lord has made about hell in the book of Matthew and he speaks far more about hell in the book of Matthew then he does about heaven
[time=1906] the Lord spoke often and he spoke long and he spoke clearly about hell because it is the kind of thing that most people don't want to think about it's the kind of thing that most people don't want to anticipate nobody wants to anticipate a heart attack nobody wants to anticipate going broke in the retirement years nobody wants to anticipate a flood rushing down a particular river where you happen to have spent your life savings I mean but because you don't want to think about it doesn't mean it's not true and so he labors over and over
[time=1934] and over again throughout the gospels to hold people's feet if you will to the fire of future and coming judgment and so let me do the same let me talk to you for just a moment about
[time=1945] the coming judgment of God the coming judgment of God in Revelation chapter 20 it says this
[time=1952] I saw a great white throne and him who sat upon it from whose presence earth and heaven fled away and no place was found for them do you realize there is coming a day when every
[time=1965] single person who has ever lived is going to want to flee from the throne of God and they
[time=1971] are going to flee but they are not going to be able to find any place of refuge it's like
[time=1977] being out in the sun on a very very hot day and the longer you're out there the more you know you're getting burned and you can feel it and you can see it and you know if it's this bad now by tomorrow morning it's going to be incredibly bad and so you search and you look for protection but you cannot find any and you are left out to be burned by the sun at the will of the sun the verse goes on and I saw the dead the great and the small
[time=1998] meaning great kings great religious leaders and small commoners such as people you and me standing standing where standing before the throne and some books were opened and
[time=2011] another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged from the things which were written in the books according to their deeds this is a terrifying scene my friends the sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and Hades gave up the dead which were in them and they were judged every one of them according to their deeds
[time=2029] they realize it doesn't matter how you died whether you died in the sea or whether you died on land whether you are cremated or blown up in a bomb it doesn't matter what happened to your physical body the day is coming when every single human body will be resurrected it tells us other places that that resurrection will be done in such a way that that physical human body will be made supernatural these are people who don't believe in Christ they will be given eternal bodies fit for eternal destruction and damnation and every single
[time=2056] physical body every single human every single human spirit will be run out into their body one way or another and they will be fitted with an eternal body fit for eternal damnation and destruction and they will stand in that body in front of this great white throne judgment
[time=2071] and those books are going to be opened and I know how I do with my sin and I know how other people do with their sin we we we do something wrong and then we start analyzing and we start justifying and we start rationalizing and what this I think is indicating is that everything you've ever done everything you thought that has been sinful everything you've said that's been sinful wanted to do hope to do and did do in public and in private in
[time=2094] light and in dark in every situation of your life has been written down in a book of life not from yourself justifying perspective but from the perspective of a righteous and a
[time=2104] holy judge who saw it for exactly what it was Hebrews 4 13 says this and there is no
[time=2110] creature hidden from his sight but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do that's an amazing thing this idea of open and laid bare it's a phrase that describe the sacrificial system in Israel and they were offering sacrificial lambs on a regular basis I mean it was not a foreign thought to anybody and the way they did it was they grabbed the top of the head and pulled the head up and open and laid bare was the neck for the final blow that came across in the moment of judgment God says please do not misunderstand my ability to know every single thing you ever did exactly as you did
[time=2143] it you are open you are laid bare to my eyes it's an amazing thing there's another account
[time=2152] of judgment in a different book Romans chapter 2 and it says there that that the wrath is coming because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart because of the stubborn
[time=2163] unrepentant heart you say why does wrath come upon a person it's because of their stubborn and unrepentant heart it's because they won't say unequivocally to God I am a hell deserving center I deserve death please forgive me I repent stubborn and unrepentant heart but
[time=2179] the passage says this because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart you are this is
[time=2185] amazing you are storing up wrath for yourself in the day of wrath and revelation of the
[time=2192] righteous judgment of God it's almost as if each individual who has ever lived has a private wrath account with God and every offense every thought every word every deed every failure
[time=2204] every act of lack of love every act of selfishness is an enormous offense against against the purity and the holiness of God and the person they offended and that all gets added up and put into the wrath account and that wrath account is sitting there building moment by moment day by day throughout that person's life and it is that very wrath the wrath that they
[time=2225] have stored up for themselves in the day of wrath that will be revealed in the righteous judgment of God it's amazing thing it says there will be tribulation and distress for
[time=2236] every soul of man who does evil because you're selfishly ambitious and you did not obey the
[time=2242] truth but you obey it on righteousness what you get is wrath and indignation that friends
[time=2248] make no mistake about it the storm is coming it's not going to miss it's coming on target and it's coming to every single human being who has ever lived as they stand before the white throne judgment in a brand new body that is fit for the destruction of eternity see a normal human body if you throw it in the lake of fire it burns up and the punishment is over you can only do so much damage to a normal physical body and what God has in mind is far more hurt and far more pain and far more destruction and far more misery and
[time=2277] far more pain than anyone physical human body could ever endure so he gives you a new body that can burn forever without being consumed that can be eaten by the worms and never disappear that can go on and on and on and on and on for all eternity being punished by his holy
[time=2293] wrath count me out whatever I got to do I don't want to be a part of that thing I'll
[time=2300] just be honest with you I have seen the accounts of his wrath in days past I have seen the accounts
[time=2306] of his plagues I have seen what he can do to people's bodies giving them boils I have seen what he can do turning water to blood I've seen what he can do in every category of dimension he is capable to torture as the career as only the creator can torture and
[time=2322] torture he will do and let me say this he is as glorified in his torturing of unredeemed
[time=2328] stubborn hard-hearted Christ rejectors as he is glorified in the giving of his own son to die for those who accept him neither of those diminish both of those exalt his glory which I will admit is a hard concept to comprehend but he is as glorified in the vile expression
[time=2344] of wrath as he is in the sweet aroma of sacrifice in Christ and people say no I don't believe
[time=2352] you no I don't think so they're not going to be any wrath you say why well I mean look
[time=2360] at all the stuff that goes unpunished I mean if God is this holy wrathful judgmental God who's going to bring condemnation on people who reject Christ where is it I mean where has it been you know the world by most conservative estimates is four five six thousand years old you know I'm beginning to wonder if God really has it in him I mean I don't know if God has the ability to bring this kind of wrath and maybe more commonly I don't know that he has the commitment to bring this kind of wrath maybe we don't have a God with that kind of commitment to bring that kind of wrath and the Lord warns over in second Peter chapter 3 he says let me tell you something you know the first one to say that now know
[time=2399] this first of all that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking following after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming forever since the fathers fell asleep all continues just as it was from the beginning of creation I mean what's the big
[time=2414] deal people are threatening the coming of Christ the coming of wrath the great day of judgment and it's been years and years and years it's been centuries and here's their phrase all continues as it was in the beginning there's no flood here I've lived here 20 years
[time=2427] on this riverbed I haven't seen a flood not one day there ain't no flood coming there'll never be a flood why well could I ever seen a flood there's never flooded here as long as I've been here's never flooded Lord responds for when they maintain that it escapes their notice that by the word of God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water by water through which the world at that time was destroyed being flooded by
[time=2452] water as hard as it is for you and I to comprehend a God that is committed to wrath and judgment
[time=2458] of eternal consequences we need only remember the flood and he took and drowned the entire
[time=2467] world's population except for Noah and his family and he has never once said that was
[time=2473] wrong he has never in all the pages of commentary came after said boy I wish I hadn't done that he has never ever said anything other than that's that's warning number one never forget what I am capable of doing never forget what I am committed to doing the flood in which I drowned who knows how many hundreds of thousands millions who knows how many people populated the earth at that time he heard their cries he saw their flailing he saw them struggling
[time=2499] he saw them going under the water he saw them taking in the first breath of water and he
[time=2505] did nothing he is both committed and capable of powerful judgment then he goes on but the
[time=2515] present heavens and earth by his word are being reserved for fire kept for the day of judgment destruction of ungodly men but let this one fact but but do not let this one fact escape
[time=2526] your notice that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years is as one day it takes us a thousand years maybe it's a long time but the Lord is above time
[time=2537] he is God he is infinite he doesn't live in space and time and so what appears to be a thousand years to us is that long to him and so don't be consoling yourself don't be deceiving yourself don't be telling yourself the judgment of God will never come because it hasn't come yet and it's been so many thousands of years that's all it's been in the mind of God then he says this the Lord is not slow about his promise as some count
[time=2562] slow does he is patient toward you not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance
[time=2568] you know what the right response is to the fact that it's been so long that God has promised judgment and it hasn't come yet instead of becoming hard-hearted and self-righteous and defensive against the ability and the commitment of God to judge it ought to provoke a sense of of repentance that God would be so patient that he hasn't judged already that
[time=2587] there is a time there is a day there is an hour right now when I can confess before the storm hits the coast of my life and I can come to Christ but instead people blaspheme
[time=2599] God and say he's not capable of judgment when in reality it's just his loving long suffering every day do you think about it every day God has to put up with the sinful aroma that emanates from this planet it's a cursed fallen planet and it's the domain
[time=2616] of Satan and it's inhabited by people who sin and violate the holiness of God every day and if there's a sweet aroma that rises to the nostrils of God in holy worship offered by believers there must be a counterpart to it that goes to his nostrils representing the flagrant sin and blasphemy and disobedience but he puts up with it he hangs on he endures
[time=2638] he waits not because he's not able and not because he's not capable of judgment but because he loves people you might ask the people of Nineveh it's amazing how God kind of gives
[time=2650] you insight into the very big issues of life remember Jonah went to Nineveh didn't want to we finally got there he preached the word and they all got converted and it was a marvelous thing the whole city got converted they came to know the true and living God it was just an incredibly marvelous thing the problem is the people that got converted in that ministry of Jonah didn't pass it on to the next generation and so the next generation knew less about God and then less about God and then less about God and eventually Nineveh became as sinful as it was before it was converted and a hundred years went by a hundred years
[time=2684] went by before Nahum showed up and these are the words that God told Nahum to say to the city of Nineveh a jealous and avenging God is the Lord the Lord is avenging and wrathful
[time=2697] you know we ought to probably have some songs that we sing about the avenging wrath of God
[time=2704] he is as glorified and those attributes as he is in his love he says I am love right here he says I am avenging and wrathful that's that's what I am it's part of my character
[time=2717] the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries and he reserves wrath for his enemies the
[time=2723] Lord is slow to anger and great in power and the Lord will by no means leave the guilty unpunished in a whirlwind and storm is his way and clouds are the dust beneath his feet
[time=2736] he rebukes the sea and makes it dry mountains quake because of him and hills dissolve indeed
[time=2742] the earth is up heaved by his presence the world and all its inhabitants in it who can stand before his indignation who can endure the burning of his anger his wrath is poured
[time=2753] out like fire and the rocks are broken up by him the Lord is good a stronghold in the
[time=2759] day of trouble and he knows those who take refuge in him but with an overflowing flood
[time=2765] he will make a complete end of its sight and will pursue his enemies into darkness tell you what my friends the storm is coming it is true the Lord is good and he is a stronghold
[time=2778] in the day of trouble in fact he is the only stronghold in the day of trouble and those who take refuge in him will not have to go through the storm but he also says I am an
[time=2787] overflowing flood and I will make a complete end to the sight of Nineveh and I will pursue my enemies into the utter darkness and darkness is often a synonym with hell and so the Lord
[time=2806] cries out on this mountainside because you know something he can see all that stuff the
[time=2814] Lord doesn't have any difficulty seeing the end of the age the Lord doesn't have any he didn't know the time and the hour of his coming but the Lord has no problem understanding the holy wrath nature of God he has no problem understanding that the penalty for sin has
[time=2827] got to be paid that's why he's on the planet and he is not in any way underestimating
[time=2833] the reality of what the fact that he is going to have to suffer the wrath of God he knows about the wrath of God and he is crying out for these people to lift their eyes just above the horizon to see the storm that awaits them the second thing I just want to say to you
[time=2851] this morning again as I have said in weeks previous is that Christ is the only sure foundation
[time=2857] Christ is the only foundation people say what is this rock that you build on is it God I mean is it the word of God is it obedience and in my opinion there is only one thing that this rock represents and that is the person of Jesus Christ he earlier referred to himself
[time=2872] as the narrow gate and using imagery all the time things that they see on a daily basis
[time=2878] these people live in a climate that is very dry it is very arid and all of them would have had friends or themselves who when the storms came would have found out uh oh I guess
[time=2888] I built in a floodplain they all would have had foolish friends who knowingly would have built in floodplains and these are things that people see and touch and handle every day in their lives and we who live in Fort Wayne know what happens when the rain is too much around here I mean there is no place for the water to go and the Lord is saying you must
[time=2907] build on me a little bit later in Matthew chapter 16 the confession of Peter resolves the issue
[time=2914] and says that Christ is the rock the solid rock upon which all must build it for eternal
[time=2920] you know security Jesus came into the district of Caesarea he began asking his disciples saying who do people say that I am what what do you got out there guys what's the word on the streets who am I what are they saying about me and they said some say you're john the baptist and others say you're Elijah others say you're Jeremiah others say you're one of the prophets and he said to them but who do you say that I am and you remember what Peter said he answered and said thou art the Christ the son of the living God and Jesus answered and said blessed are you
[time=2950] son and bargeona because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you but my father who is in heaven revealed it to you and I also say to you that you are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church
[time=2961] and the gates of hell will not prevail against what's the rock the rock isn't Peter my friends the rock is the confession that Christ is the son of the living God it says in 1 Thessalonians 1
[time=2973] 9 that their response when confronted with the broad road and the narrow road when Paul came to the city of Thessalonica and said you guys are involved in a in a damning religion of self-righteousness
[time=2984] you need to repent and come to Christ it says in 1 Thessalonians 1 that they turned from the worship of idols and they waited on God and looked to heaven for the coming of his son who he raised from
[time=2994] the dead and he was able to deliver them from the dead excuse me deliver them from the wrath to come Jesus is the one who delivers people from the wrath to come it's an amazing simple powerful truth in Romans chapter 5 it says the same thing all over again
[time=3014] talking about the judgment and all that would happen much more than having now been justified by the blood of Christ we shall be saved from the wrath of God through him the only salvation
[time=3026] from the wrath of God the only place to hide nowhere on earth nowhere in the heavens only in
[time=3032] the person of Jesus Christ can you be saved from the wrath of God it goes on to say for if while
[time=3038] we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his son in other words the initial act of salvation happened through the death of Christ and his resurrection on the cross having been reconciled we shall be saved by his life Christ is not just a rock he is a living rock
[time=3053] he is a living rock who who makes intercession on a regular constant total basis for his children who have put their faith in him always maintaining their protective place inside of his righteousness
[time=3064] you don't have Christ you don't stand on the rock you haven't been baptized into the person of Christ
[time=3071] when the theory of God's wrath comes fuming at the end of the age you will stand there at that
[time=3077] throne naked by yourself with all your deeds all the people you've hurt all the sinful words you've
[time=3084] said all the sinful thoughts you've thought all the selfishness all the jealousy anger greed lust deception and lies will stand there being properly reported about you from the books
[time=3095] which have been kept on your life and God will lay you bare hold your neck back and be ready for the
[time=3103] final blow don't don't want to go through that don't want to stand there by myself i do not want
[time=3113] to be before the throne of God in my self made self-fashioned righteousness that's one storm i'd
[time=3121] love to miss remember there at the illustration in Matthew seven he said the house fell and great
[time=3129] was its fall people are going to be overwhelmed by the penetrating gaze of God people are going
[time=3136] to be shattered and overcome by having to see themselves for the first time as God has been
[time=3143] seeing them with the masks and the and the sunglasses of their own self-deception their own illusions
[time=3149] about themselves they're going to have to see who they really were in all that they were and they're going to be shattered underneath that revelation of who they are people tend to minimize grossly
[time=3161] the degree to which their sin offends the holiness of God all that will be cleared up they'll see perfectly how much the offenses have been in front of the holiness of God
[time=3175] it'll be a devastating moment and that's all Jesus is saying please please before you leave
[time=3182] this place before you leave this mountain before you go running off making plans just take a minute will you just take a minute well look at what they did verse 28 Matthew chapter 7 verse 28
[time=3195] now we're out of the sermon itself and now we're getting commentary from Matthew as to what happened
[time=3201] after the sermon it says this the result was that when Jesus had finished these words the multitudes were amazed at his teaching they were amazed at his teaching for he was teaching them as
[time=3212] one having authority and not as their scribes they'd never heard anybody speak the truth like he did
[time=3218] they'd never heard anybody speak of divine matters with such simplicity and clarity they'd never heard anybody speak with such love they'd never heard anybody speak with such absolute and utter authority never quoted anybody except Old Testament and that was the correct impressions that they had he just gave divine truth right out of his own heart his own mind because he was divine and their response they were amazed at it but they didn't respond right
[time=3243] the Lord didn't preach that day so they could be amazed he didn't preach so they could analyze he didn't preach so they could critique he didn't preach so they could discuss he preached so they could be converted so they could take action and that's exactly what he says don't be one of the people who hears my words and doesn't respond act in a way that's
[time=3264] commensurate with what I have told you do you think if by a miracle we could go back to 1969 and get them in and the wives the families the couples that had built
[time=3281] these multi-million dollar ranches down the riverbed of the San Diego Valley do you think if we could take a hold of them back in the 70s or back in the 60s when they actually built those places when they signed checks and gave their life earnings to to have those buildings
[time=3295] erected and to buy that property think if we could have brought them out of the 70s and had them stand on that riverbank in 1969 and watch their own barns and watch their own houses and watch
[time=3304] their family members and watch their cattle do you think they would have built their
[time=3310] I don't think they would have I think they would have built somewhere else the Lord's saying to you this morning he's saying would you do me a favor
[time=3321] would you just close your eyes for a second would you just let me invite you to do that let me just ask you to close your eyes just from the right where you are just just just for a second and if you can whatever the great white
[time=3334] throne would look like to you will you just see it and just there's this presence that's full of
[time=3340] white glory blinding light that you can't even look at on that throne and he's asking you to see
[time=3348] yourself there and listen to the pages of a book get opened and then the report of who you really
[time=3354] are the stuff you did that nobody knows about you right now they know about it and they have it written down the deception on tax returns the the things you've done in hotel rooms by yourself
[time=3366] the things you've set on telephones that you shouldn't have said to people the the selfishness the motives of the heart I mean it's all coming on a big screen and tetna color and it's all true and it's all about you and and you can't even begin to open your mouth to explain to justify or to mitigate because the standard is perfect righteousness now if you can would you just sense
[time=3387] and see in your own mind's eye that your body is somehow changing and it's turning from flesh to something else I mean it looks like flesh but you can sense something's happened to that body and now it's different you now have your eternal body that's fit for destruction and then you hear these
[time=3403] words depart from me I never knew you and you see a side of God that you've only read about
[time=3411] you see his wrath and you're thrown into the lake of fire and it burns and burns and burns
[time=3419] look up for a minute if you're here today and you're not ready for that
[time=3427] some of you are seeing that and as you're imaging that in your mind you're saying yeah it's so cool I mean that's what's going to happen but the cool part is I'm not going to be there I deserve to be there and I don't want those books read I mean I deserve to be there
[time=3442] but I'm going to be in Christ I'm going to be in a completely different place and God's penetrating gaze will never come upon me because when he looks at me he just sees the righteousness of Christ I've been forgiven that's paid him full and some of us who are here today and we've committed our lives to Christ we can hear and read about this and there's a sense of awesome foreboding but there's a sense of man I'm glad that's not coming my way and you may be here today and it is coming your way and you've never committed your life to Christ you've never given your life to Christ you've never even understood what it would mean to give your life to Christ under the illusion that you could work your way to heaven and somehow stand before him on that final day and have you have your good deeds outweigh your bad deeds what an insane notion
